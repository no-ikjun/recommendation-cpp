 At this point , the Japanese attack began to slow . The strength of the Australian resistance had resulted in heavy casualties and as a result the Japanese were unable to take advantage of the gains they had made . This allowed the Australians to begin their own counter @-@ thrust on 19 October . Following a heavy artillery preparation , the 2 / 28th Infantry Battalion retook Katika . The Australians received reinforcements the next day with a squadron of Matilda tanks from the 1st Tank Battalion arriving by landing craft at Langemak Bay amidst tight security that was aimed at keeping their arrival secret from the Japanese . Accompanying the tanks was the 26th Brigade ; its arrival meant that the 9th Division had now been committed in its entirety . Although on 21 October the Japanese withdrew from Siki Cove , the fighting around Katika continued for four more days as the Japanese attempted to retake it against fierce resistance from the 2 / 28th . Katagiri gave the order for his forces to withdraw back to Sattelberg by 25 October , when it became apparent that the counterattack had been defeated . The Japanese had suffered 1 @,@ 500 casualties , including 679 killed . In comparison , the Australians had lost 49 killed and 179 wounded . 
 = = = Sattelberg = = = 
 An old German mission , Sattelberg lay roughly 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) inland and due to its size and height – 3 @,@ 150 feet ( 960 m ) – its possession by a large force of Japanese posed a significant threat in the minds of the Australian commanders . It offered good observation of the coastal area and could serve as a base for the Japanese to disrupt Australian lines of communication . As a result , Wootten decided to capture it . The main approach to the mission lay along the road that ran through Jivevaneng . Although the main thrust of the Japanese counterattack had been turned back by 25 October , Jivevaneng was still in doubt and the 2 / 17th Infantry Battalion was still fending off Japanese attacks . Consequently , the 2 / 13th Infantry Battalion was brought up , and together with the 2 / 17th they began clearing operations . These were completed by the night of 2 / 3 November when the Japanese ceased their assault and withdrew from around the village . Follow up actions on 6 November resulted in the destruction of the road @-@ block that the Japanese had established on the Sattelberg road east of Jivevaneng in October . 
 With Jivevaneng decided , the Australians turned advancing west towards Sattelberg . The force that was chosen for this was the recently arrived 26th Brigade , which would be supported by nine Matildas of the 1st Tank Battalion . At the same time , the 4th Brigade , a Militia formation detached from the 5th Division , was brought up to relieve the 26th Brigade of garrison duties around Finschhafen . The tanks moved up to Jivevaneng under the cover of an artillery barrage to drown out their noise in an effort to keep their presence secret until the start of the advance . On 16 November , the 2 / 48th Infantry Battalion , supported by the artillery of the 2 / 12th Field Regiment and the machine guns of the 2 / 2nd Machine Gun Battalion , captured Green Ridge overlooking the track , which was the designated forming @-@ up point for the advance on Sattelberg , which began the following day . 
 The advance got off to a bad start initially as it was hampered in the inland area by the prevalent rugged terrain which consisted largely of thick jungle and steep " razor @-@ back " ridges . The ability of forces to manoeuvre in this environment was limited and Whitehead , the Australian brigade commander , determined to utilise infiltration tactics as a result . He sent columns of infantry , no more than company @-@ size , to advance along " narrow fronts " ahead of one or two tanks , with engineers in support to improve the track or deal with " booby traps " or mines as they were found . The brigade 's scheme of manoeuvre saw the 2 / 48th advance up the main track as the 2 / 23rd and 2 / 24th Infantry Battalions protected its flanks to the south and north respectively . None of the Australians ' first day objectives were met . The 2 / 48th was held up in front of Coconut Ridge by stubborn resistance after one of the tanks was disabled and two others were damaged . On the flanks , both the 2 / 23rd and 2 / 24th also came up against strong defences in the shape of pillboxes and machine @-@ gun nests , suffering many casualties and Coconut Ridge did not fall until the following day . 
 The advance then continued , and by 20 November Steeple Tree Hill had been secured by the 2 / 48th , with the 2 / 23rd advancing towards its southern portion from Kumawa , while the 2 / 24th continued to strike north towards the " 2200 " feature . Initially , this had just been conceived as a holding action to protect the 2 / 48th 's flank , but due to the slow progress on the main track , at this point , the Whitehead decided to change his strategy , determining to use a " double @-@ pronged " attack , with the 2 / 24th also attempting to break through to Sattelberg from the north . 
 Elsewhere , in the north @-@ east , closer to the coast , the establishment of observation posts on key terrain overlooking Japanese main supply routes by Australian forces began affecting the supply situation of the Japanese forces around Sattelberg , as supply parties were ambushed as they attempted to bring up food and ammunition . The Australians were also short of supplies and , as a result , they paused on 21 November while supplies were brought up to them , before the advance resumed the following day . The main thrust aimed for a <unk> where the track turned north . Here the 2 / 48th turned to the north @-@ east , while the 2 / 23rd left the track and began advancing north @-@ west towards the " 3200 " feature , which lay west of Sattelberg ; the 2 / 24th , coming up against increasingly steep terrain and very strong Japanese defences around the 2200 feature , unsuccessfully attempted to bypass the position and strike towards Sattelberg . The same day , in the north , the Japanese attempted another counterattack on 22 November , aiming to relieve the supply situation around Sattelberg and to recapture Finschhafen . The counterattack failed , as it was blunted by the Australian depth position around Pabu and , lacking the tempo of the earlier counterattack in October , it was ultimately beaten back , with little affect on Australian operations around Sattelberg . 
 The fortress around Sattelberg was methodically reduced by intensive Allied bombing which lasted five days , coming to an end on 23 November . The same day , Japanese aircraft also undertook ground support operations with a force of 44 Japanese aircraft attacking Australian positions round Jivevaneng . This did not change the situation around Sattelberg as by then the Australians had reached its southern slopes and the following day they began probing forward towards its summit . Throughout the day they launched a number of attacks , but heavy defensive fire pushed these back until a platoon under the command of Sergeant Tom Derrick fought its way almost to the top , with Derrick leading the way , destroying 10 Japanese positions with grenades as he went . With the Australians having secured a toehold just below the summit for the night , the Japanese withdrew under the cover of darkness and the following morning the advance to the mission was completed . For his feat , Derrick later received the Victoria Cross , his nation 's highest military decoration . 
 = = = Pabu = = = 
 Although the main effort of the Australian forces shortly after the landing at Scarlet Beach in late September was upon the drive towards Finschhafen , some effort was made by troops from the Papuan Infantry Battalion to carry out reconnaissance north of the main engagement area towards Bonga and Gusika and throughout early October the 2 / 43rd Battalion conducted a number of patrols in the area . Intelligence gathered from these patrols and through aerial reconnaissance evidence revealed that the Japanese were using tracks in the area to supply the forces in the west atop Sattelberg . In response , the Australians established observation posts and after further reconnaissance it became apparent to the Australians that one hill , which they named " Pabu " and which was part of a larger feature dubbed " Horace the Horse " , was the key to holding the area . Its location placed it directly astride the main Japanese supply route , and its proximity to the Australian forward positions at North Hill meant that it was in range of Australian artillery and could therefore be occupied by a small force that could be defended by indirect fire . In mid @-@ October , however , amidst the Japanese counterattack , Brigadier Bernard Evans , commander of the 24th Brigade , had ordered the withdrawal of Australian forces on Pabu as he had sought to reduce Australian lines in order to defend the beachhead . 
 After the October counterattack was turned back , the Australians sought to regain the initiative . Evans was replaced by Brigadier Selwyn Porter and Wootten decided to establish a position in depth behind the Japanese forward line , deciding to once again establish a force at Pabu . On 19 / 20 November , three companies from the 2 / 32nd Infantry Battalion , under the command of Major Bill Mollard , occupied the position , and began to attack the Japanese resupply parties that were moving through the area , inflicting heavy casualties . 
 Meanwhile , the commander of the Japanese XVIII Army , Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi , ordered Katagiri to launch another counterattack . The supply situation was acute by this stage , with ammunition running low and troops being limited to one @-@ third of their daily rations , nevertheless the counterattack was scheduled for 23 / 24 November . However , the Australian occupation of Pabu and the threat it posed to the Japanese supply route , forced the Japanese commander to bring his schedule forward , and to divert some of the effort away from the recapture of Finschhafen and upon the Australian forces advancing towards Sattelberg in the south . 
 In an effort to retake Pabu and the ground north of the Song River , a force consisting of two Japanese battalions , from the 79th and 238th Infantry Regiments , advanced south along the coastal track from Bonga . From 22 November , the Japanese attacked the Australians around North Hill , which was defended by the 2 / 43 . This effectively cut off the Australian forces on Pabu , which now only consisted of two companies from the 2 / 32nd and over the course over the next three days they were subjected to almost continual attack . On 25 November , the Japanese assaults had been blunted that the Australians began to push reinforcements forward . The two remaining companies of the 2 / 32nd were sent forward on 26 November , supported by four Matilda tanks and artillery , struck forward towards Pabu to reinforce its garrison which was under its heaviest attack since it had been occupied . They arrived on Pabu and in the process secured " Pino Hill " to the south . 
 The following day , the Japanese called a halt to their attack on the Australian right , and subsequently troops from the 2 / 28th Infantry Battalion were then sent to the east to secure the position 's flanks . On 29 November , the 2 / 32nd was relieved by the 2 / 43rd . In doing so , it was struck by a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment which killed or wounded 25 . Over the 10 days that the 2 / 32nd had held Pabu , Mollard 's force had endured repeated mortar and artillery fire , and repeated attacks , but with the assistance of strong artillery support , it had held its ground and in doing so had helped blunt the force of the Japanese counterattack at a time when Australian forces were making heavy progress towards the Japanese fortress at Sattelberg . Later , the Japanese commanding general , Adachi , pinpointed the Australian capture of Pabu as one of the main reasons for the defeat of his force during the Huon Peninsula campaign . Losses during the fighting around Pabu were 195 Japanese and 25 Australians killed , and 51 Australians wounded . 
 = = = Wareo – Gusika = = = 
 With a second counter @-@ thrust having been beaten back again and the loss of Sattelberg , Katagiri decided to fall back to the north , to form a defensive line around Wareo to wait for the Australians to follow up their victories with a further advance . By this time , Katagiri 's forces were suffering from a manpower shortage due to a lack of reinforcements and the supply situation had still not been rectified . The Australian commander , Wootten , was keen to regain the initiative and he decided to resume the advance in the north with a view to securing the remainder of the Huon Peninsula . The first stage of Wootten 's plan involved advancing north and securing a line along a ridge that ran between Gusika , on the coast , and Wareo , which was 4 @.@ 35 miles ( 7 @.@ 0 km ) inland . It was to take place in two main drives : the 26th Brigade , having secured Sattelberg , would advance to Wareo on the left , and the 24th Brigade would advance on the right , up the coast to secure Gusika and two large water features about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) inland near the head of the Kalueng River , known collectively to the Australians as " the Lakes " . A third , minor advance would take place in the centre to Nongora and the Christmas Hills , responsibility for which was given to the 20th Brigade . 
 The advance on the right saw the 2 / 28th Infantry Battalion advance towards Bonga and with armoured support , captured Gusika on 29 November . Later they crossed the Kalueng River and advanced towards the Lagoon further north along the coast . The 2 / 43rd Battalion then advanced from Pabu towards " Horace 's Ears " , where the Japanese made a stand which held the Australians up briefly . They then continued east towards the Lakes , where they were to take over responsibility for the central drive from the battalions of the 20th Brigade , who were then to be rested for the next stage of the campaign . 
 In the centre , the 2 / 15th Infantry Battalion set out from Katika to capture Nongora on 30 November . They advanced over broken countryside and after the lead company had crossed the Song River , they were engaged by machine @-@ gun fire from a strong defensive position . This held them up briefly , until the other companies came up . Skirting the position , they continued on towards Nongora where they stopped short of the high ground and established a defensive position for the night . The following morning , the Australians launched a costly and unsuccessful company @-@ level attack against the ridge , but after darkness the Japanese abandoned the position , allowing the 2 / 15th to occupy it and then clear Nongora on 2 December . Following this , they began sending fighting patrols out towards the Christmas Hills area in the west , and to the east towards the Lakes to make contact with the 24th Brigade . 
 The link up occurred on 3 December and the following day a composite force from the 2 / 32nd and 2 / 43rd Infantry Battalions took over the advance to the Christmas Hills , which were secured on 7 December after the Japanese abandoned the position in the wake of a series of flanking moves by the Australians , an intense artillery and mortar bombardment and a frontal assault . 
 Meanwhile , on the left , the advance began on 28 November . On the map , Wareo was roughly 3 @.@ 4 miles ( 5 @.@ 5 km ) away from Sattelberg , however , due to the nature of the terrain , the actual distance to be travelled was estimated at being four times that . For the advancing Australian infantrymen , the burden was made even greater by heavy rain which turned the tracks over which they were advancing into a muddy morass that could not be traversed by motor transport . This , coupled with the unavailability of New Guineans to serve as bearers , meant that the Australians had to carry almost all of their own supplies on their backs . In an effort to keep the advance moving , the entire 2 / 24th Infantry Battalion was tasked with carrying supplies for the 2 / 23rd , which led the advance from Sattelberg . 
 On 30 November , the 2 / 23rd reached the Song , fighting its way across and the next day , after sharp fighting amidst a renewed local counterattack by Japanese forces , Kuanko was taken . To the north of the abandoned village , the Japanese were positioned in strength and they launched a strong counterattack , which retook the vital high ground for them but was checked from progressing further by a heavy Australian artillery bombardment . At this stage , the 2 / 24th Infantry Battalion was released from its portage task and it was sent west to conduct a flanking movement around the Japanese position , cutting the Kuanko – Wareo track and capturing Kwatingkoo and Peak Hill early on 7 December , following a Japanese withdrawal . From there , it was a short march on to Wareo , which the Australians secured early the next day . 
 The main Japanese force then began to withdraw north towards Sio , however , sporadic fighting continued around Wareo over the following week as isolated pockets of Japanese resistance conducted rearguard operations to allow their comrades to get away . The most significant action during this time took place on 11 December when the 2 / 24th Infantry Battalion attacked the 2200 feature north @-@ east of Wareo , near the Christmas Hills , which resulted in 27 Japanese killed . 
 = = = Sio = = = 
 The next phase of the campaign involved the advance of Australian forces along the coast towards Sio , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) from Finschhafen . Following the capture of Gusika , the responsibility for the first part of the advance to Sio was taken over by the infantry of the 4th Brigade , under the command of Brigadier Cedric Edgar . They were brought forward from Finschhafen early in December where they had been undertaking garrison duties and on 5 December , the 22nd Infantry Battalion began the advance , crossing the Kalueng River . Lacking the experience that the 2nd AIF units had , the Militia battalions advanced more cautiously than they might otherwise have done so . They were supported by American landing craft equipped with rockets , which bombarded Japanese positions along the coast , while the expansion of the airfield around Finschhafen and the establishment of a naval facility there enabled the Allies to use Consolidated PBY Catalina aircraft and PT boats to further attack Japanese resupply efforts . 
 As they advanced , the Australians came up against stiff resistance , as Japanese forces in the area fought hard to buy time for the forces falling back from Wareo by delaying the Australian advance . Initially , the 22nd 's attack was turned back ; however , fire support from artillery and armour helped overcome this opposition , and the advance continued with the 22nd and 29th / 46th Infantry Battalions advancing in turns up the coast with the 37th / 52nd moving on their left further inland . Lakona was reached on 14 December and , after finding the Japanese forces there to be positioned in strength , the 22nd Battalion worked its way around the town , enveloping the Japanese defenders and pushing them back to the cliffs , where on 16 December tanks were used to launch the final attack . After this , the 29th / 46th took over the coastal advance to Fortification Point , which it reached alongside the 37th / 52nd on 20 December , crossing the <unk> River and gaining the high ground to its north . 
 The 4th Brigade suffered 65 killed and 136 wounded on top of rising casualties from disease and was replaced by the 20th Brigade at this point . The 26th Brigade took over flank protection duties inland . The advance then rolled quickly as Japanese morale broke and organised resistance diminished . Large gains were made against only limited resistance , which often amounted to minor skirmishes against small groups of Japanese . Hubika fell on 22 December with no opposition , and <unk> two days later . Blucher Point was reached on 28 December , where the 2 / 13th Infantry Battalion regained contact with the retreating Japanese and fought a sharp contact . Elsewhere , that same day , US forces landed further west at Saidor . 
 This sealed the Japanese decision to quit the Sio area , and over the course of two weeks the Australians advanced swiftly up the coast , overcoming only " sporadic opposition " as the Japanese continued to withdraw to the west towards Madang , seeking to avoid being cut off by the forces at Saidor . The 2 / 15th took over the advance on 31 December , reaching <unk> on New Years Day . The <unk> River was crossed on 2 January 1944 and the following day the 2 / 17th reached Cape King William . Further river crossings followed at the <unk> and <unk> Rivers as <unk> fell on 6 January ; next , the Dallman and Buri Rivers were forded as Scharnhorst Point was rounded on 9 January . After a final action was fought at Nambariwa , the 2 / 17th finally reached Sio on 15 January . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The operations undertaken by the 9th Division during the Huon Peninsula campaign were the largest by the Australian Army to that point of the war . Backed up by significant industrial resources which provided them with a significant technological edge over the Japanese , the Australian campaign destroyed what offensive capabilities the Japanese had in the region , and enabled them to gain control of vital sea lanes of communication and airfields that furthered their ability to conduct offensive operations in north @-@ western New Guinea and New Britain . After the capture of Sio , on 21 January 1944 the 9th Division handed over to the 5th Division . The 5th Division was a Militia formation and its take over was part of the wider Australian plan to re @-@ allocate the veteran divisions of the 2nd AIF to more intense operations elsewhere , namely the Philippines , while using the less experienced Militia formations to undertake the lower intensity work required to mop @-@ up isolated pockets of Japanese resistance . In the event , the 9th Division was precluded from taking part in the fighting in the Philippines due to inter @-@ Allied politics , and it was subsequently employed in Borneo in 1945 . Meanwhile , one of the 5th Division 's component formations , the 8th Brigade , conducted mopping up operations around Sio throughout January into February and March 1944 . They also effected a link up with US forces around Saidor . 
 The 9th Division suffered 1 @,@ 082 battle casualties during its involvement in the fighting on the Huon Peninsula . This included 283 men who were killed in action and one who was listed as " missing " . In addition , the 4th Brigade also suffered several hundred casualties , bringing the Australian total to 1 @,@ 387 . These casualties were relatively light in the wider context of the division 's involvement in the war as they had suffered more than twice that number during the fighting around El Alamein earlier in the war . Regardless , a number of factors combined to make the fighting on the Huon Peninsula , in the words of one participant , " harder and more nerve @-@ racking " than that which the 9th had taken part in before . These included the harsh terrain , the closeness of the combat , and the lack of hot food , water and motor transport . Disease also proved significant and during the campaign up to 85 per cent of the division 's personnel were ineffective due to illness at some stage . 
 Nevertheless , the most significant factor was the fighting qualities of the Japanese soldier . One Australian veteran , Sergeant Charles Lemaire , who had previously fought against the Germans at El Alamein with the 2 / 17th Infantry Battalion , described the Japanese as " tenacious , brave , self @-@ sacrificing " . In the minds of the Australian soldiers , the Japanese had a reputation for being tough opponents and for not taking prisoners . Despite this perception amongst the Australians , there was a sense of confidence in their technological superiority . For the Japanese soldiers , the technological edge that the Australians possessed and their relatively abundant supply of ammunition and artillery and air support was the main psychological factor that governed their perceptions of the Australians as enemy . In order to counter this , Japanese commanders exhorted their troops to draw upon " spiritual strength " to achieve victory . In the end , although many of the significant actions of the campaign were infantry engagements which occurred a long way from the Australian base areas where their technological superiority was limited , the Australians ' use of combined arms tactics ultimately proved decisive . Although preliminary aerial bombardment , particularly that which was employed around Sattelberg , proved largely ineffective in terms of its physical effects , it did serve to reduce Japanese morale . Used in combination with artillery preparation , which caused significant casualties , considerable disruption was caused to Japanese lines of communications that were already stretched . Suffering from ammunition shortages that limited their fire support , the Japanese defenders were overwhelmed by Australian infantry that had a level of artillery support that was unprecedented for an Australian division in the Pacific , and who advanced in concert with tanks that they employed in a manner that exploited the element of surprise . 
 Japanese losses during the campaign amounted to a significantly higher total than those of the Allies , although exact numbers have not been established . About 12 @,@ 500 Japanese soldiers participated in the campaign and about 5 @,@ 500 are believed to have been killed . Some sources indicate a possibly higher toll . With only 4 @,@ 300 Japanese reaching Sio at the end of the campaign , it is possible that the figure is closer to 7 @,@ 000 or 8 @,@ 000 . A significant amount of war materiel was also lost during the campaign . Of the 26 field artillery pieces that the Japanese possessed in the region , 18 were captured by the Australians during the campaign , while 28 out of their 36 heavy machine @-@ guns were also lost . 
 At the start of the campaign , the Australian Army had been the only ground force engaging in combat with the Japanese in the region . By the end , though , the involvement of US forces in the region had increased as the US Army took over responsibility for the main Allied effort from the Australians . Elsewhere , the 7th Division 's advance towards the Finisterre Range saw the capture of Shaggy Ridge and a subsequent advance towards Bogadjim and then Madang , which fell in April . In July and August , US forces subsequently clashed with Japanese forces , including some of those that had escaped from the Huon Peninsula , around the Driniumor River . Meanwhile , the Australian Army 's efforts in the Pacific were scaled back , and it was not until late 1944 and early 1945 , when several campaigns were launched in Bougainville , New Britain , Aitape – Wewak and Borneo , that it undertook major campaigns against the Japanese again . 
 = Destiny ( wordless novel ) = 
 Destiny ( German : Schicksal ) is the only wordless novel by German artist Otto Nückel . It first appeared in 1926 from the Munich @-@ based publisher Delphin @-@ Verlag . In 211 wordless images the story follows an unnamed woman in a German city in the early 20th century whose life of poverty and misfortune drives her to infanticide , prostitution , and murder . 
 The book was the first whose images were made with <unk> instead of the more common woodcuts , and showed a greater depth of character and cinematic sense than previous wordless novels . The book inspired American artist Lynd Ward to tackle the medium , beginning with Gods ' Man in 1929 . Ward 's success brought about an American publication of Destiny in 1930 which sold well . The book has impressed critics and has become one of the best @-@ known wordless novels . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The book follows an unnamed woman in a German city in the early 20th century who lives a life of poverty and misfortune . She is the constant victim of her society — especially the men , such as her drunken , abusive father , and the traveling salesman who gets her pregnant . She is imprisoned for the murder of her unwanted child , and upon release turns to life as a prostitute . The police hunt her down after she murders a man with an axe , and as she jumps from an upper @-@ floor window they shoot her dead . 
 = = Background = = 
 Otto Nückel ( 1888 – 1955 ) was born in Cologne in the German Empire . He studied medicine in Freiburg before switching to art , which he studied in Munich in 1910 – 12 . His paintings were less successful than the illustrations he made for magazines such as the satirical Simplicissimus and for books by Thomas Mann and E. T. A. Hoffmann . 
 In 1918 , the Belgian Frans Masereel created the first wordless novel , 25 Images of a Man 's Passion , and followed it up the next year with his longest and most successful work , Passionate Journey . Such books achieved particular popularity in Germany , where they sold in the hundreds of thousands in the 1920s . Masereel 's woodcut artwork drew inspiration from the German Expressionists and displayed socialist themes of struggle against social injustice , themes that were to be common in the wordless novel genre . 
 = = Production and publication = = 
 Nückel 's medium was the <unk> — engraved plates of lead — a medium Nückel turned to when he found wood in short supply in Germany . Lead plates are also more economical than wood in that they can be melted down and reused if errors are made during engraving . Destiny was the first wordless novel to employ lead engraving . Nückel made 211 prints in black and white for the book . The images range in size from 2 3 ⁄ 4 × 2 3 ⁄ 4 inches ( 7 × 7 cm ) to 4 3 ⁄ 4 × 4 inches ( 12 × 10 cm ) , and were originally printed on thin Japanese handmade paper when the book was published in Germany in 1926 .

 Nückel engraved his plates with a multiple tool ( also called a lining tool ) , a sort of chisel that cuts multiple parallel lines at once , which gives a mechanical hatching texture to the print . The images vary not only in dimensions but in focus , from close @-@ ups of faces to <unk> of crowds . 
 In contrast to the earlier works of Masereel , Destiny focuses on an individualized woman instead of the plight of a man as cipher for humankind . Lynd Ward found Nückel 's book had greater psychological depth in its characters and plot development , and more skilled technical achievement in the artwork . Canadian artist George Walker believed that Masereel 's plots were more original . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 American artist Lynd Ward discovered a copy of Nückel 's book in New York in 1929 and was inspired by it to create wordless novels of his own , beginning with Gods ' Man the same year . The success of both Gods ' Man and the subsequent Madman 's Drum ( 1930 ) led to a number of American publishers bringing other wordless novels into print , including Destiny in 1930 , which sold well in the US . 
 Literary scholar Martin S. Cohen called Destiny " perhaps the most pathetic ... and one of the most memorable " examples of the wordless novel genre . Wordless novel scholar David Beronä judged the book " a pioneering work in the development of the contemporary graphic novel " for the complexity of its plot , its social consciousness , and its focus on an individual character . Reviewer Christian Gasser commended the book 's " narrative pull " , which he credited as creating a " haunting , edgy narrative rhythm " of a story of persecution , satire , and Expressionist art . The story , he suggests , may be allegory of the Weimar Republic in which it arose . 
 = Alfred V. Verville = 
 Alfred Victor Verville ( November 16 , 1890 – March 10 , 1970 ) was an aviation pioneer and aircraft designer who contributed to civilian and military aviation . During his forty @-@ seven years in the aviation industry , he was responsible for the design and development of nearly twenty commercial and military airplanes . Verville is known for designing flying boats , military racing airplanes ( such as the record breaking Verville @-@ Sperry R @-@ 3 Racer ) , and a series of commercial cabin airplanes . His planes were awarded with the Pulitzer Speed Classic Trophy in 1920 and 1924 . 
 Verville was a founder of three aeronautical companies , the General Aeroplane Company , Verville Aircraft Company , and the Buhl Aircraft Company . He worked for General Billy Mitchell during his service at the United States Army Air Service from 1918 to 1925 . From 1937 to 1945 , he worked as a consultant for companies such as Douglas Aircraft , Curtiss @-@ Wright , Snead Aircraft , and Drexel Aviation . Verville spent the next sixteen years in the U.S. Federal government , primarily in the Bureau of Aeronautics , before retiring in 1961 . 
 Verville received many honors and awards , including a selection as a fellow of the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum in 1962 . An airmail stamp was issued in 1985 by the US Postal Service in Verville 's honor . In 1991 , he was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Verville was born in Atlantic Mine , a small town in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula , on November 16 , 1890 , as the son of Victor Verville and <unk> Miron . As a child , his mother bought him a <unk> @-@ style box kite from Sears Roebuck , which captured his imagination and started his interest in flight and aviation . Verville also began reading stories about the Wright Brothers in newspapers and magazines with great interest . Later he even wrote to the Wrights and Glenn Curtiss and received responses . 
 After graduating from Adams Township High School , Verville took a correspondence course in electrical engineering . He moved to Detroit , Michigan at the age of twenty , and from 1910 to 1913 he worked in the electrical departments of the Detroit Edison Company , Ford Motor Company , and Hudson Motor Car Company . By 1913 , Verville had made his mind up that he wanted to learn to fly . William Edmund Scripps , the editor and owner of The Detroit News , introduced Verville to Glenn Curtiss in July 1913 . Curtiss encouraged Verville to apply for his Spring 1914 flight school . Instead , Verville went to <unk> , New York in February 1914 , where Curtiss Aeroplane Company was located , and told Curtiss he wanted to work as an apprentice in his drafting and engineering shop . Curtiss agreed and this began Verville 's aviation career . 
 Verville excelled as a draftsman and designer , but still wanted to attend flight school and to become an exhibition pilot . After applying and being passed over three times for the Curtiss Flying School , Verville went to Curtiss , who responded : " No , Mr. Verville you don 't want to be a pilot . We can get all the pilots we want . What we want are designers . You 're [ really ] a designer and you don 't know it . " While at Curtiss Aeroplane , Verville took an active part in the development of the transatlantic flying boat America ( which was a Curtiss H @-@ 2 ) and the Curtiss Jenny of World War I fame . In the Fall of 1914 , Verville left the company and joined the <unk> Plane and Motor Company in New Jersey ; shortly thereafter , he joined the Thomas @-@ Morse Airplane Company . In March 1915 , he returned to Detroit and joined the General Aeroplane Company , where he led his first full design and build to his specifications , the Verville Flying Boat . 
 On July 9 , 1917 , Verville married Bertha M. <unk> in Escanaba , Michigan . He had three children with her , daughters Betty and Janet , and son Myron . Also in 1917 , Verville left the General Aeroplane Company to become executive engineer of Fisher Body Corporation , where he supervised the construction of de Havilland DH @-@ 4 airplanes .

 In June 1918 , Verville joined the Engineering Division of the U.S. Army Air Service ( <unk> ) as a civilian , and was based out of the <unk> Engineering Division at McCook Field in Dayton , Ohio . In 1920 , the young engineer gained national prominence when his Verville @-@ Packard R @-@ 1 Racer won the Pulitzer Speed Classic Trophy at the first held National Air Races ( at Roosevelt Field , New York ) by finishing first out of twenty four other planes , achieving a top speed of 156 @.@ 54 mph . 
 In 1919 Brigadier General William Mitchell requested the Engineering Division to design a light @-@ weight " motorcycle of the air " that could operate as a liaison between Army field units . Verville completed the Messenger design in early 1920 . The Lawrence Sperry Aircraft Company of Farmingdale was contracted to build five Messengers in April 1920 . The first Messenger flight was on November 1 . Later designated the Verville @-@ Sperry M @-@ 1 Messenger , the plane is notable for its small size , simple construction , and inexpensive cost , which made it ideal for testing and experimentation . The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics used one in its pioneering aerodynamic research programs from 1923 to 1929 . Sperry modified twelve into the radio @-@ controlled Messenger Aerial Torpedo and developed the apparatus for a Messenger to make the first successful airship hook on and release in December 1924 . 
 Following World War I , in the capacity as an engineering advisor , Verville joined General Billy Mitchell and his aide , Lieutenant Clayton Bissell , on their sailing trip to Europe in December 1921 . The three men toured France , Italy , Germany , Holland , and England in order to check on the European progress of aviation . From their research they produced a 206 @-@ page report , which was published as an U.S. Army Air Service Information Circular . General Mitchell asked Verville to incorporate some of the European developments they had observed and to produce a plane for the U.S. Army Air Service 's participation in the upcoming 1922 National Air Races . 
 The resulting plane , the Verville @-@ Sperry R @-@ 3 Racer , was the second plane to utilize retractable landing gear and incorporated many features advanced for its time . The completion of the R @-@ 3 encountered challenges because the planned Curtiss D @-@ 12 engine was not available . So , instead Verville had to use the problematic Wright H @-@ 3 ( Hispano ) engine , which had major vibration issues . Three R @-@ 3 's competed in the 1922 National Air Races , but only one finished in 5th place with a top speed of 181 mph . After the 1922 race , Verville was able to finally obtain a Curtiss D @-@ 12 engine . It was installed on an R @-@ 3 and based on trials , it was determined that it could break a world record . On March 31 , 1923 , with Orville Wright officially observing from the ground , pilot Lieutenant Alexander Pearson , Jr. set a 500 km World Speed Record of 167 @.@ 73 mph ( 269 @.@ 94 km / h ) over a 10 @-@ lap course at Wilbur Wright Field . For the 1924 National Air Races , his R @-@ 3 won the 1924 Pulitzer Speed Trophy at 216 mph . 
 While at the Air Service , Verville was awarded eight aeronautical patents for technologies such as airplane truss design , radiator mounting , and an automatic gun mechanism .

 In 1925 , Verville left the government service to co @-@ found the Buhl @-@ Verville Aircraft Company with the Buhl family in Detroit . On March 29 , 1927 , Buhl was awarded the first Approved Type Certificate for its Buhl @-@ Verville CA @-@ 3 Airster ( i.e. <unk> No. 1 ) issued by the Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce on March 29 , 1927 . There were a total of 20 of this aircraft manufactured and it broke a number of speed and endurance records , placing at the top of the Ford National Reliability Air Tour and the National Air Races . Verville was the chief designer from the company 's founding in 1925 until 1927 . 
 In 1928 , Verville left Buhl @-@ Verville to establish the Verville Aircraft Company , also in Detroit . The company sought to market planes to the wealthy private owner . Verville Aircraft produced the Verville Air Coach , a four passenger , high @-@ wing monoplane , which made its debut at the 1929 Detroit Air Show and the Verville Sport Trainer , a two @-@ seat tandem biplane . The United States Army Air Corps purchased 4 Sport Trainers under the designation YPT @-@ 10 .

 Verville joined the Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce in 1933 . The Aeronautics Branch became the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 . During his time there , Verville served in the following roles : aeronautical engineer ; chief of the Manufacturing , Engineering , and Inspections Service ; and finally assistant chief of the Aeronautic Development Section . In his role as chief of the Manufacturing , Engineering , and Inspections Service , he was in charge of the reviews for issuing type certificates for all manufactured airplanes . 
 Verville left government service to be a consultant for companies including Douglas Aircraft ( 1937 – 38 ) , Curtiss @-@ Wright ( 1941 – 42 ) , Snead Aircraft ( 1942 ) , and the Drexel Aviation Company ( 1942 – 45 ) . Verville briefly returned to the Bureau of Air Commerce from 1939 @-@ 1941 .

 In 1945 , once again returning to government service , he joined as a member of the Naval Technical Mission to Europe , and later , the U.S. Navy 's Bureau of Aeronautics ( 1946 – 61 ) . At the Bureau of Aeronautics , from 1950 until his retirement in 1961 , Verville was a technical advisor and consultant to the director of the Technical Data Division . Verville retired in 1961 and moved to La Jolla , California . He died on March 10 , 1970 from a heart attack at age 79 .

 = Røa Line = 
 The Røa Line ( Norwegian : <unk> ) is a rapid transit line of the Oslo Metro , Norway , which runs from Majorstuen in Oslo to Østerås in Bærum . It serves neighborhoods such as Smestad , Hovseter , Huseby and Røa in northwestern Oslo , and Grini , <unk> and Østerås in northeastern Bærum . The line is served by Line 2 of the metro , which connects to the city center via the Common Tunnel and onwards along the Furuset Line . The lowest part of the Røa Line , consisting of two stations , is shared with the Kolsås Line , and thus also served by Line 2 of the metro . The Røa Line is owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon , and operated by Oslo T @-@ banedrift on contract with the public transport agency Ruter . 
 The first part of the line , originally a light rail , was from Majorstuen to Smestad , and opened in 1912 . It was built as a cooperation between the Municipality of Aker and the company Holmenkolbanen , and connected to the Holmenkoll Line 's terminus . In 1928 , the line received a connection to the city center when the first part of the Common Tunnel was completed . In 1935 , the first extension of the Røa Line proper was made , when the line was extended to Røa . In 1942 , the Kolsås Line became a branch . Additional extensions to the Røa Line were made in 1948 to Grini , in 1951 to Lijordet and in 1972 to Østerås . By then , the line had become an integrated part of the municipal Oslo Sporveier . The line was upgraded to rapid transit in 1995 , became part of the metro and started running through the city center . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 Construction of housing in the Smestad area started after Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei ( KES ) established a tramway from the city center to Majorstuen in 1894 . Four years later , fund @-@ raising started to build the Aker Avenue towards Smestad , but the recession made fund @-@ raising difficult . The plans were launched again in 1904 , and subsequently revised in 1908 , by which time they including a tramway along the avenue . In 1910 , A. S. Guldberg , Iver <unk> , W. <unk> @-@ Kaas and H. A. Mørk applied for a concession to build a tramway along the route . This was granted by the municipal council in Aker on 26 May . The four individuals then transferred their rights to the municipality , who started negotiating rights with KES , and Holmenkolbanen — the latter who had a suburban tramway running from Majorstuen , the Holmenkollen Line . 
 An arrangement was made with Holmenkolbanen , where the municipality would expropriate the necessary land and build the bed , while Holmenkolbanen would lay the tracks , the wires and operate the trams . The line would remain owned by the company A / S <unk> , which was again owned by Aker Municipality . The agreement had a duration of 50 years , but the municipality retained the right to purchase the line if work to extend the line from Majorstuen through the Common Tunnel to the city center had not started by 1917 , or had not been completed by 1922 . Government approval was granted on 7 July 1911 , and the construction was completed on 7 November 1912 . The 1 @.@ 9 @-@ kilometer ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) long line was single tracked , with passing loops at Borgen and Smestad , which were the only stations in addition to Majorstuen . Holmenkolbanen used a single tram , with departures every 20 minutes . There were extra departures from Borgen to Majorstuen during the afternoon rush @-@ hour . 
 = = = Nationaltheatret expansion = = = 
 The process of extending the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen to the city center had started in 1901 . The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements between the city and the company , in part because the two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway . Construction started in 1912 , but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminus . The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien , but this would make it difficult for the company to build the tunnel through the city center to connect to the suburban tramways east of the city center . Construction was stopped in October 1914 . 
 The following year , the municipality launched a contest to make the best suggestion for the tram networks . It took five years to select a winner , and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret . But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station . Construction commenced that year and the station and tunnel opened in 1928 . When the tunnel had not been completed by 1922 , Aker Municipality decided to purchase the line . At the time , the municipality was planning to start its own tram company , Akersbanerne , and the Smestad Line was considered as part of the network , along with the planned Sognsvann Line . But delays caused the Sognsvann Line not to open until 1934 . The take @-@ over caused a disagreement between the two companies about payment for the common section , which would still be owned by Holmenkolbanen . Not until 1932 was the issue resolved . 
 The investments had drained Holmenkolbanen , particularly after it had received a massive lawsuit for damage to adjacent properties during the tunneling . After the issue had been resolved by the Supreme Court in 1931 , the company needed more capital to start operations . Aker Municipality offered to transfer its ownership of the Smestad Line and the Sognsvann Line to Holmenkolbanen , in exchange for the majority of shares in the company . 
 = = = Røa extension = = = 
 In the 1920s , the area towards Røa experienced a growth in housing . Akersbanerne proposed in 1931 to the municipal council that the Smestad Line be extended towards Makrellbekken . Government permission was granted on 26 May 1933 , and construction started the same year . The extension was built with single track . When the line was taken over by Holmenkolbanen , the new owner suggested extending the line to Røa . Government permission was granted in on 29 June 1934 , and construction started immediately . The 2 @.@ 9 @-@ kilometer ( 1 @.@ 8 mi ) extension opened on 24 January 1935 . 
 The new line was initially not profitable , because <unk> <unk> had kept its concession to operate buses in the area . Not until World War II was the bus route terminated . The Røa Line and the Sognsvann Line were both upgraded in 1939 . On 6 July , the section from Makrellbekken to Røa was upgraded to double track , and later Volvat was moved and placed inside a tunnel . A level crossing was built at the intersection with <unk> , and was completed on 15 December . 
 = = = Branch to Kolsås = = = 
 The Lilleaker Line , which connected to the street tramway at Skøyen , had been extended to Kolsås in 1930 . The owner Bærumsbanen instead wanted the line to go the faster route via the Common Tunnel to Nationaltheatret . Concession was granted in 1938 for a link from Jar on the Lilleaker Line to Sørbyhaugen on the Røa Line . The construction was delayed because a bridge needed to be built across <unk> , and the company ran out of money , and construction stopped for nine months in 1940 . The line was opened on 15 June 1942 , and the section from Sørbyhaugen to Kolsås was renamed the Kolsås Line . This resulted in two companies operating from Sørbyhaugen to Nationaltheatret , but an agreement was made where only Holmenkolbanen 's tickets were sold on the section , so all revenue went to that company , regardless of the train 's operator . The Kolsås Line operated every fifteen minutes along the Røa Line part . 
 = = = Bærum extensions = = = 
 Proposals to extend the line into the neighboring municipality of Bærum had first been launched in 1919 . In 1941 , construction of an extension to Grini started . The main problem was getting building materials for a bridge to cross <unk> , and a local disagreement about where the station at Røa was to be located . The 0 @.@ 9 @-@ kilometer ( 1 mi ) extension was opened on 22 December 1948 , after Røa Station had been moved , and the line put in a short tunnel under the center of Røa . 
 The 1 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometer ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) extension via Eiksmarka to Lijordet opened on 3 December 1951 . Lijordet was intended to be named <unk> , but there was already a station with that name on the Norwegian State Railways ' network , and two stations with the same name were not permitted . In 1959 , a block signaling system was installed between Røa and Makrellbekken . 
 During the early 1970s , Bærum Municipality wanted to extend the line onwards to <unk> , and were willing to pay the construction costs . Holmenkolbanen also wanted the municipality to pay for new trams , but the municipality was not willing to do this . The line was therefore only extended to Østerås , which could be reached using the existing fleet . The 0 @.@ 6 @-@ kilometer ( 0 @.@ 37 mi ) extension was opened in 1972 . Since 1978 , Holmenkolbanen has had sufficient trams to operate an extension , but since then the municipality has not been interested in extending the line further . 
 = = = Metro standard = = = 
 The ownership of the line was gradually taken over by the municipality through Oslo Sporveier . In 1975 , most of the shares were bought , along with those that Oslo Sporveier had received as part of the municipal merger with Aker in 1948 . Gradually during the 1970s and 1980s , Holmenkolbanen became more integrated into Oslo Sporveier , including the two using the same rolling stock , tickets and uniforms . Oslo Sporveier upgraded the line in the last half of the 1970s , laying new ties , upgrading the tracks to higher weight and purchasing new trams . 
 Plans to have trams run through the city center have existed since 1919 . In the late 1940s , Holmenkolbanen revised the plan , and proposed extending the Common Tunnel eastwards . From 1951 , the municipality started working on plans for the Oslo Metro in the eastern part of the city . The large difference in traffic between the eastern and western lines caused the plans to be changed during the 1960s , and the eastern network was equipped with third rail power supply . The eastern lines at first terminated at Jernbanetorget , and the plans were to continue the lines onwards towards Bislett . But by the 1970s , these plans changed , largely because of the increase of traffic in the west and decrease in the east . On 7 March 1987 , the services from the west , including the Røa Line , were extended from Nationaltheatret to Stortinget , a station that allowed transfer to the metro . 
 The Sognsvann Line was upgraded to metro standard and reopened on 3 April 1993 . The Røa Line was closed on 5 February 1995 to be upgraded to metro standard . The upgrades meant that all platforms needed to be extended to 110 meters ( 360 ft ) to allow six @-@ car metro trains . The only exception was Østerås , that was made only long enough for five cars , although this could easily be extended later . The upgrade involved a complete renovation of the tracks , with the old ones being replaced with new , and increasing the weight to 49 kilograms per meter ( 33 lb / ft ) . The overhead wire was replaced with a third rail ; this required all four level crossings , at Makrellbekken , Hovseter , Eiksmarka and <unk> , to be replaced . In the former three , the track was sunk under the level of the road , requiring several hundred meters of the line to be rebuilt . Pedestrian underpasses were built at <unk> , Borgen , Holmen , Huseby skole and Lijordet . 
 Three stations were closed : Grini , Huseby skole and <unk> . Volvat kept the two @-@ car length , and was no longer served by the Røa Line , only the Kolsås Line . To compensate for the closing of Huseby skole , Røa was moved back to it original position , causing a heated local debate . The signaling system was replaced with the automatic train protection used on the metro . But the installation was delayed , and a temporary system was used . This caused an accident at <unk> , where twelve people were injured . During the upgrade , the area along the line was served by buses . Bus stops could only be established at places where cars could pass , making it difficult to place stops at Røa and Sørbyhaugen . Passengers transferring to the Kolsås Line would normally have 15 minutes longer travel time , and congestion caused delays of up to 30 minutes . This caused more people to use cars , which increased the congestion further . Ridership on the buses was significantly lower than on the rail . The Kolsås Line opened on 20 August and the Røa Line on 19 November . After the opening , the line connected with the Furuset Line as Line 2 , and started being served by T1000 trains . The Røa Line , including the common section in the city center , has been extended eight times , more than any other line of the Oslo Metro . 
 = = Route = = 
 The Røa Line starts at Majorstuen , a major public transport hub located 2 @.@ 7 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 7 mi ) from Stortinget . Majorstuen was the site of the company 's head offices , depots , workshops and employee residences . Majorstuen serves several educational institutions , such as Chateau Neuf , MF Norwegian School of Theology , the Norwegian Academy of Music , the Norwegian Police University College , several larger office complexes and the Oslo Tramway Museum . From Majorstuen , the Røa Line and the Kolsås Line follow the same tracks . The line immediately enters a short tunnel , in which the now closed Volvat Station is located , 0 @.@ 7 kilometers ( 0 @.@ 43 mi ) from Majorstuen . Borgen follows next , located 1 @.@ 5 kilometers ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) from Majorstuen , and serves a primarily housing area and a larger cemetery . 
 Next is the now closed <unk> , and Smestad , located 1 @.@ 9 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from Majorstuen . The areas are mostly single dwellings built in the 1910s , following the arrival of the line . After Smestad , the Kolsås Line branches off and the Røa Line continues past the closed Sørbyhaugen to Makrellbekken , located 2 @.@ 7 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 7 mi ) from Majorstuen . The next station is Holmen , located 3 @.@ 4 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 1 mi ) from Majorstuen , and Hovseter , located 4 @.@ 0 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) from Majorstuen . Hovseter is a residential area with dominated by apartment blocks from the 1970s , and also serves <unk> Upper Secondary School . The station has previously been used as a terminus for extra rush @-@ hour trains . The line then runs past the closed Huseby skole , located 4 @.@ 3 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 7 mi ) from Majorstuen , which served Huseby <unk> , the base of the Royal Guard . The next station is Røa , located 4 @.@ 8 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 0 mi ) from Majorstuen , which has also been a terminus for extra rush @-@ hour trains . Røa has substantial commercial properties and is located close to <unk> and a golf course . The line then passes <unk> , located 5 @.@ 2 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 2 mi ) from Majorstuen , which is the last station located in Oslo . 
 The line then runs over <unk> , which is also the border to Bærum , and past the closed Grini . The next station is Eiksmarka , located 6 @.@ 2 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 9 mi ) from Majorstuen , which until the late 1970s had the line 's only spur , to allow ballast stone to be loaded from <unk> . The area has single dwellings from the 1950s . Next is Lijordet , located 6 @.@ 9 kilometers ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) from Majorstuen , which serves <unk> <unk> , the country 's only gallop race course . The line 's terminus is Østerås , located 7 @.@ 5 kilometers ( 4 @.@ 7 mi ) from Majorstuen . There are some commercial and office buildings in the vicinity of the station , although the area is dominated by housing .

 The Røa Line is served by Line 2 of the Oslo Metro , which continues from Majorstuen via the Common Tunnel and connects to the Furuset Line . The line runs every 15 minutes , with enhanced service weekdays between 7 and 19 giving eight departures an hour . During late evenings and Saturday and Sunday mornings , it runs every 30 minutes . The lower part of the line , from Majorstuen to Borgen , is also served by Line 2 , which continues along the Kolsås Line . Along this section , there is twice the frequency . Travel time from Østerås to Majorstuen is 16 minutes , to Stortinget is 20 minutes , and to Vestli on the Grorud Line is 50 minutes . The metro and the line are owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon and operated by Oslo T @-@ banedrift on contract with Ruter . 
 The line crosses into Bærum , but the entire metro system is within a single fare zone . Ticket machines are available at all stations , and the system is operated with a proof @-@ of @-@ payment system . Smestad is a transfer station to the Kolsås Line ( Line 2 ) , while Majorstuen is a transfer station for other west @-@ bound lines . Transfer to Ruter buses can be made at Majorstuen , Smestad , Hovseter , Røa and Eiksmarka . Transfer to the Oslo Tramway can be made at Majorstuen to lines 11 , 12 and 19 , serving the Briskeby Line , the Homansbyen Line , and the Frogner Line . In the Common Tunnel , Jernbanetorget is the transfer station for Oslo Central Station , which serves all mainline trains in Eastern Norway . Most west @-@ bound mainline trains can also be reached at Nationaltheatret . 
 = = Future = = 
 Proposals for the line have been made since the extension to Østerås . The current municipal master plan calls for the line to be extended to <unk> Station , where it would again intersect with the Kolsås Line . One possibility is also that the service be continued along the Kolsås Line and a new branch be built to Sandvika , the municipal center of Bærum . However , an extension has not been a priority for the municipal politicians , although the right @-@ of @-@ way has been secured , which will simplify construction .

 " Just Like Heaven " is a song by British alternative rock band The Cure . The group wrote most of the song during recording sessions in southern France in 1987 . The lyrics were written by their frontman Robert Smith , who drew inspiration from a past trip to the sea shore with his future wife . Before Smith had completed the lyrics , an instrumental version of the song was used as the theme for the French television show Les Enfants du Rock . 
 " Just Like Heaven " was the third single released from their 1987 album Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Kiss Me , while Smith 's memories of the trip formed the basis for the song 's accompanying music video . The song became the Cure 's first American hit and reached number 40 on the Billboard charts in 1988 . It has been praised by critics and covered by artists such as Dinosaur Jr . , Alvin and the Chipmunks , and Katie Melua . Smith has said he considers " Just Like Heaven " to be one of the band 's strongest songs . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 In order to develop material for Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Smith forced himself to write music for 15 days of each month . During this regimen , he developed the chords and melody which form the basis of " Just Like Heaven " . Structurally , Smith found what he had written was similar to The Only Ones 's 1979 hit " Another Girl , Another Planet " . When he brought an instrumental demo of the song to the album recording sessions in Southern France , Cure drummer Boris Williams increased the tempo and added an opening drum fill which inspired Smith to introduce each instrument singularly and in sequence . 
 When the French TV show Les Enfants du Rock asked The Cure to provide a theme song , Smith offered the instrumental version . As he explained , " It meant the music would be familiar to millions of Europeans even before it was released " . He completed the lyrics when the group moved the sessions to Studio Miraval , located in Le Val , Provence @-@ Alpes @-@ Côte d 'Azur . The band completed the song quickly , and at the time Smith considered it to be the most obvious potential single from the songs the band had recorded during their two @-@ week stay at Miraval . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " Just Like Heaven " is written in the key of A major and consists of an A – E – Bm – D chord progression which repeats throughout the song , except during the chorus when the band plays an F ♯ m – G – D progression . The song 's central hook is formed from a descending guitar riff which appears between song verses and in parts of the bridge and the last verse . This guitar line contrasts with the " fuzzier mix " of the rhythm guitars . 
 According to Smith , " The song is about hyperventilating — kissing and fainting to the floor . " The lyrics were inspired by a trip with his then @-@ girlfriend ( and later wife ) Mary Poole to Beachy Head in southern England . Smith said the opening line of the song ( " Show me , show me , show me how you do that trick " ) refers to his childhood memories of mastering magic tricks , but added " on another [ level ] , it 's about a seduction trick , from much later in my life " .

 " Just Like Heaven " was the third single released from the band 's Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me album . Melody Maker 's review of the single was undecided ; writer David Stubbs described it as " a colourful , fluttery , fussy thing " and " unimpeachable " , but added , " [ it ] turns my face green , as if having consumed too many truffles . " The song was The Cure 's eleventh top 40 hit in the UK , and stayed on the charts there for five weeks during October and November 1987 , peaking at number 29 . In the United States , " Just Like Heaven " became The Cure 's first top 40 hit when in January 1988 it reached number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 for one week . 
 Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said " the stately ' Just Like Heaven ' [ ... ] is remarkable and helps make the album [ Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Kiss Me ] one of the group 's very best " . Ned Raggett , also of Allmusic , wrote that the song was " instantly memorable , [ and ] sparkling with rough energy [ ... ] it 's a perfect showcase for Robert Smith 's ear for wistful , romantic numbers . His main guitar line , a descending , gently chiming melody , contrasts perfectly against the fuzzier mix of the rhythm guitars , while Simon Gallup 's bass and Boris Williams ' strong , immediate drums make for a great introduction to the track . " Barry Walsh of Slant magazine said The Cure " ... is at the top of its game [ ... ] on the simply stellar ' Just Like Heaven ' . Glistening descending guitar lines , Gallup 's throbbing bass line , and Williams ' authoritative thumping frame a typically lovelorn Smith lyric , with the end result being one of The Cure 's finest singles , and perhaps one of the best pop singles of the late ' 80s . " 
 Although the later singles " Lovesong " and " Friday I 'm in Love " reached higher chart positions , " Just Like Heaven " was the band 's American breakthrough , and has been described as " in American terms , at least , the one Cure song everyone seems to know . " The song inspired the name of , and was used in the 2005 film Just Like Heaven . In 2004 Rolling Stone magazine ranked it number 483 on their list of the " 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " . In 2005 Entertainment Weekly ranked " Just Like Heaven " 25th on its list of " The 50 Greatest Love Songs " , saying , " Turns out guys who wear black eyeliner can be happy . " The following year the song placed at number 22 on VH1 's poll " 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s " . 
 Robert Smith said he considers " Just Like Heaven " to be one of the band 's strongest works , and called it " the best pop song The Cure have ever done " . Several high @-@ profile fans have expressed their appreciation of the song . Musician Ben Folds told Blender " everything about it — the songwriting , the music — is state of the art . It ’ s as good as it gets . Anytime I hear it on the radio or a mix tape , I jump around like a freak . " J Mascis said his band Dinosaur Jr . ' s affection for the song inspired them to record a cover version that was released in 1989 . On 16 July 2006 , " Just Like Heaven " was played as a wake @-@ up call for the crew of Space Shuttle Discovery on their flight STS @-@ 121 at the request of astronaut Piers Sellers ' family ; Sellers told mission control center that the song reminded him of " the wild , happy , beer @-@ drinking years of my youth . " Just like Heaven was used extensively as the playout track on episode ten of the current series of the BBC TV drama New Tricks " The Queen 's Speech " which was broadcast on Monday 20 October 2014 .

 The music video for " Just Like Heaven " was directed by Tim Pope , who had directed all of the band 's previous videos since 1982 's " Let 's Go to Bed " . The video was filmed in England 's Pinewood Studios in October 1987 . Set on a cliff overlooking a sea , the video recreates many of the memories detailed in the song 's lyrics . When a fanzine asked Smith what the song was about , he said it was inspired by " something that happened to me a long time ago — see the video ! " While Smith had claimed for years that the video was shot at the same place that inspired the song , he later admitted that the bulk of it was filmed in a studio , utilising footage of the water and cliffs of Beachy Head taken for the band 's 1985 video for " Close to Me " . 
 During the song 's piano solo the sky turns to nighttime and the band is shown clad in white shirts . Mary Poole appears in this sequence as a woman dressed in white dancing with Smith . As Smith explained , " Mary dances with me in the video because she was the girl [ in the song ] , so it had to be her . " Pope later commented , " [ Poole ] can honestly lay claim to being the only featured female in any Cure video , ever . "

 = Meta Knight = 
 Meta Knight ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Meta Naito ) is a fictional character in Nintendo 's Kirby video game series created by Masahiro Sakurai and developed by HAL Laboratory . He first appeared in the 1993 video game Kirby 's Adventure as a nameless character remaining there until the game Kirby 's Avalanche . The character also appears in several Kirby comic books , in the 2001 anime series , and in the Super Smash Bros. series . 
 Meta Knight is a mysterious but honorable knight ; due to this attitude he has played a " friend or foe " role in the Kirby series , which led video game critics to debate his nature and allegiances . He has received mainly positive critical reception since his introduction ; his development within the series , from a nameless character to one of Kirby 's main enemies , was praised , and he has been described as a " cool " character by reviewers . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Meta Knight is an enigmatic , yet honorable swordsman who follows a chivalric code ; this is exemplified when he gives Kirby a sword with which to fight . In keeping with his penchant of offering Kirby a sword with which to duel , Meta Knight himself wields a sacred , golden sword called Galaxia ( <unk> , <unk> ) . He is always seen wearing a silver mask ; beneath it he looks identical to Kirby , with a dark blue body ( black in his debut ) and white eyes , which appear yellow with his mask on ( and with his mask off in Kirby : Planet Robobot ) . He also sports a navy blue mantle ( red in his debut ) called the Dimensional Cape ( <unk> , <unk> Manto ) , which can change into a pair of wings and allows him to teleport . However , these wings appear directly attached to his body in Kirby 's Return to Dream Land and Kirby : Planet Robobot . Much like a knight , Meta Knight 's design has become more armored since his debut ; he has sported a pair of <unk> since Kirby 's Avalanche , gauntlets on his mitten @-@ like gloves since Kirby : Squeak Squad , and <unk> since Super Smash Bros. Brawl . He is usually described as Kirby 's rival and occasional mentor , as well as an anti @-@ hero . Despite occasionally being portrayed as a villain , he has benign intentions , will often fight alongside or assist Kirby when necessary for his survival or for the sake of the world . This attitude has led to debate about his allegiances .

 = Hurricane Erin ( 2001 ) = 
 Hurricane Erin was the longest @-@ lived hurricane in the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season . The sixth tropical depression , fifth tropical storm , and first hurricane , Erin developed from a tropical wave on September 1 . After strengthening to a 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) tropical storm as it moved to the west @-@ northwest , wind shear weakened Erin and caused it to dissipate on September 5 . The remnants re @-@ organized into a tropical depression the next day , and Erin strengthened into a hurricane on September 9 while moving northwestward . This was the latest date for the first hurricane of the season since Hurricane Diana on September 10 , 1984 . Erin quickly intensified and reached peak winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) later on September 9 . At its closest approach , Erin passed 105 miles ( 170 km ) east @-@ northeast of Bermuda near peak intensity , and subsequently weakened as it turned to the east . A trough turned Erin to the northeast , and after passing just east of Cape Race , Newfoundland it became extratropical on September 15 . The extratropical remnant continued northeastward and lost its identity near Greenland on September 17 . 
 Though it passed 105 miles ( 170 km ) east of Bermuda , Hurricane Erin caused little damage or effects on the island . Large swells from the hurricane produced rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast of the United States . In Newfoundland , Erin dropped moderate amounts of rain and gusty winds , though no damage was reported . Throughout its path , Erin caused no casualties , no injuries , and minor damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 30 . It almost immediately displayed signs of tropical cyclone formation with the development of deep convection and curved rainbands . Organization continued , and late on August 30 Dvorak classifications began on the system . On August 31 , after passing well south of the Cape Verde islands , the system stopped its organization trend . Convection became sporadic , and the system became poorly organized as it moved westward at 20 mph ( 32 km ) . However , environmental conditions remained favorable . On September 1 , the cloud pattern became better organized , and a low @-@ level circulation quickly developed . Following an increase in convection and conformation of a low @-@ level circulation by a buoy , it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Six late on September 1 while located 1 @,@ 600 miles ( 2 @,@ 590 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . 
 Located to the south of a mid @-@ level ridge , the depression moved to the west @-@ northwest . With weak to moderate upper @-@ level wind shear over the system , the depression gradually organized , and intensified into Tropical Storm Erin on September 2 . Though Erin had favorable upper @-@ level outflow and developing convection , the inner core of the storm remained disorganized . The storm slowly strengthened , and attained an initial peak intensity of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) while located about 1 @,@ 150 miles ( 1 @,@ 855 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . Favorable conditions were expected to allow Erin to continue to strengthen to reach winds of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . However , an upper @-@ level low to the northwest of Erin produced strong vertical shear over the storm , and Erin quickly weakened as the low @-@ level circulation became exposed to the southwest of the deep convection . The shear slightly abated on September 4 , allowing Erin to briefly re @-@ strengthen . However , the storm remained disorganized , and following an increase in southwesterly wind shear Erin began a weakening trend . On September 5 , Erin weakened to a tropical depression , and hours later the low @-@ level circulation dissipated . 
 The remnant low pressure area continued to the west @-@ northwest , and on September 6 the system gradually produced deep convection . A surface circulation redeveloped in the northern portion of the remnants of Erin , and the system developed into a tropical depression again late on September 6 while located 365 miles ( 585 km ) north @-@ northwest of where it previously dissipated . The depression moved to the north @-@ northeast , then turned to the north @-@ northwest , and regained tropical storm status on September 7 . Erin steadily intensified , and its convection and cloud pattern became much better organized on September 8 . On September 9 Erin intensified into a hurricane while located 275 miles ( 440 km ) , and a 40 mile ( 65 km ) wide eye developed . Erin quickly strengthened on September 9 to reach a peak intensity of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . , however some sources claim that Erin may have been a little stronger . 
 Shortly after reaching its peak intensity , Erin passed 105 miles ( 170 km ) east @-@ northeast of Bermuda , its closest approach to the island . The hurricane maintained peak strength for 18 hours before slowly weakening . Its weakening trend was slower than usual due to warmer than usual water temperatures , and by late on September 10 Erin weakened to a Category 2 hurricane . Multiple short @-@ wave troughs weakened the western portion of the subtropical ridge , and on September 11 Erin decelerated as it turned to the east . A strengthening mid- to upper @-@ level trough over eastern Canada turned the hurricane to the northeast . It gradually accelerated its forward motion , and on September 15 , after weakening to a strong tropical storm , Erin passed just east of Cape Race , Newfoundland . Convection gradually diminished as it moved through the north Atlantic Ocean , and later on September 15 Erin became extratropical . The extratropical storm continued northeastward , and after crossing over southern Greenland Erin merged with a high @-@ latitude cyclonic flow to the east of Greenland on September 17 . 
 = = Impact and preparations = = 
 When the hurricane appeared to pose a threat to Bermuda , its government issued a hurricane watch . Around 24 hours before Erin made its closest approach , the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning . Initial forecasts indicated Erin would pass within 15 miles ( 24 km ) of the island . As a result , ferry and bus transport was suspended . Officials prepared a school to be used as an emergency shelter , though few people used it . The threat of the hurricane cancelled several flights in and out of the Bermuda International Airport , stranding hundreds of travellers . Cruise ships and cargo ships also cancelled or delayed their arrivals . The strongest winds of Erin remained to the east of the island . As a result , the highest winds on the island peaked at 41 mph ( 66 km / h ) . Moderate winds downed several trees onto power lines , leaving dozens of homes without power for several hours . Prolonged durations of strong waves resulted in coastal beach erosion . Large waves broke a boat from its moorings , though two men swam through the rough seas to prevent the yacht from running aground . The storm produced rainfall on the island , yet no flooding was reported . Little structural damage occurred on Bermuda , and there were no reported injuries or casualties . 
 Swells from Erin produced rip currents along the North Carolina coastline . Waves were expected to reach over 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) in height . Officials at the National Hurricane Center cautioned authorities and residents to monitor the rough seas . 
 Erin produced moderate winds across Newfoundland , including a maximum sustained wind report of 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) with a gust of 67 mph ( 108 km / h ) at Cape Race . The storm also produced moderate amounts of precipitation , peaking at 5 @.@ 1 inches ( 131 mm ) at <unk> Island . Along the coast , the passage of the storm led to wave heights of up to 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 3 m ) , while offshore a buoy recorded a wave height of 47 feet ( 14 @.@ 2 m ) . No damage was reported in Canada .

The team has also produced many Top 10 hits in the United Kingdom for acts such as Blue , Mis @-@ Teeq and Atomic Kitten , and worked with European acts Javine , Shola Ama , Five , and Samantha Mumba . 
 The team had been listening to American hits and " trying to measure up " . They remixed American hip @-@ hop and R & B songs , adding layers of melody to suit the European radio audience . In the wake of their early successes , the team had to choose whether to remain in Norway or move to pursue their goals : " We knew that to make the records we really wanted to make , we had to go to America . " Hermansen and Eriksen chose to produce records in the United States , while Rustan preferred to remain a producer in Norway because he did not want to leave his family behind . 
 In 2001 , Stargate produced and co @-@ wrote songs for American pop singer Mikaila 's self @-@ titled debut album .

 = = Influences and style = = 
 Stargate chiefly produces songs in the genres ; R & B , pop , dance @-@ pop , Europop and hip hop music . 
 Hermansen and Eriksen grew up as R & B and hip hop fanatics in Norwegian suburbs , where most children listen to Europop and American rock . Their interest in music started in the 1980s with breakdance and rap . Eriksen and Hermansen were raised on pop music , growing up listening to music of 1970s pop group ABBA and Germany @-@ based pop outfit Boney M. In an article by The New York Times , Barry Weiss , president of Jive Records , who had hired Stargate to produce songs , " Those influences lend themselves to them making very melodic pop records , with great hooks and choruses . " According to the team , they have always loved American music , citing acts such as Prince , Michael Jackson , Usher , Destiny 's Child , and R. Kelly and the English band Depeche Mode as their inspiration . The team also cited producers Antonio " L.A. " Reid and Kenneth " Babyface " Edmonds of the 1980s R & B band The Deele , and R & B @-@ pop production team Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis as their early influences . 
 In their usual production style , Stargate first creates an instrumental backing track — also common in pop and hip hop productions — from which a collaborator would write lyrics and add vocal melody into . In an interview with About.com , the team explained their style : 
 We always start out with a musical idea . Great effort goes into creating a solid melodic core . We both play the keyboards and program , but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools , while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input . However , we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations . When we have some killer beats and musical starting points , we hook up with one of our favorite topline writers , who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody . We make sure there 's a lot of melody in the track , so it can inspire the writer . Together with the topline writer we work , often <unk> and simplify the song , and never quit before we feel we 've got a killer hook . 
 Ben Sisario of The New York Times described Stargate 's music as " sugary , lilting R & B in the Michael Jackson vein leavened with the kind of melody @-@ rich European pop that paints everything in bright primary colors ... Their work carries on a tradition of Scandinavian bubble @-@ gum artistry that stretches from Abba to Max Martin " . Sisario added that , unlike other 's producers in the United States , " Stargate signature is more difficult to detect , because to some degree the duo 's style is an adaptable method , not a specific sound " . Steve Lunt , an A & R executive at Atlantic Records , pointed out , however , that " if you put a bunch of Stargate songs together you will see the thread running through them " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Critics found some of Stargate 's succeeding works a replica of " Irreplaceable " ' s musical formula . Sheffield commented that , in the song " Tattoo " by Sparks , the team " have no shame about churning out ' Irreplaceable ' replicants forever " , reprising the acoustic guitar @-@ drum loop formula . The New York Times music critic Kelefa Sanneh deemed it " sounds like a cousin " of " Irreplaceable " . The release of R & B singer Chris Brown 's 2007 single " With You " produced similar impressions : Sheffield , in his review for Brown 's album , noted that " Stargate was just trying to roll out ' Irreplaceable ' one more time " . Hillary Crosley of Billboard magazine wrote that " With You " " leans a bit too heavily " toward " Irreplaceable " . Stylus Magazine also noted that Rihanna 's Stargate produced single , " Hate That I Love You " was a rehash of Ne @-@ Yo and Stargate 's previous works saying , " Here you 've got the ' Sexy Love ' drums , the ' Irreplaceable ' strum , and a bit of the synth and chorus melody from ' So Sick ' ... is hardly the new twist all these old bits need to sound fresh .

 = Elmo 's World = 
 " Elmo 's World " is a 18 @-@ minute @-@ long segment that was shown at the end of the children 's television program Sesame Street . It premiered on November 16 , 1998 as part of the show 's structural changes , designed to appeal to younger viewers and to increase ratings , which had fallen in the past decade . The segment was developed out of a series of workshops that studied the changes in the viewing habits of their audience , and the reasons for the show 's lower ratings . " Elmo 's World " used traditional elements of production , but had a more sustained narrative . It was presented from the perspective of a three @-@ year @-@ old child as represented by its host , the Muppet Elmo , who was performed by Kevin Clash . In 2002 , Sesame Street 's producers changed the rest of the show to reflect its younger demographic and the increase in their viewers ' sophistication . 
 Long @-@ time writer Judy Freudberg came up with the concept of " Elmo 's World " , and writer Tony Geiss and executive producer Arlene Sherman helped develop it . Instead of the realism of the rest of the show , the segment presented Elmo moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer @-@ generated animation , which looked like " a child 's squiggly crayon drawing come to life " created by the host , and with " a stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness feel to it " . Elmo 's pet goldfish Dorothy and the members of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo to do all the talking , and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen . 
 " Elmo 's World " remained popular throughout its run . In 2009 , " Elmo 's World " temporarily ceased production and was replaced by " Elmo the Musical " in 2012 . 
 = = Background = = 
 By the early 1990s , Sesame Street had been on the air for over 20 years and was , as author Michael Davis put it , " the undisputed heavyweight champion of preschool television " . The show 's dominance began to be challenged throughout the decade by other television shows for preschoolers such as Barney & Friends , by the growth of the children 's home video industry , and by the increase of thirty @-@ minute children 's shows on cable . Sesame Street 's ratings declined , so the Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW ) , the organization responsible for putting the show on the air , responded by researching the reasons for their lower ratings . 
 For the first time since the show debuted , the producers and a team of researchers analyzed Sesame Street 's content and structure and studied how children 's viewing habits had changed . The analysis was conducted during a series of two @-@ week @-@ long workshops and was completed in time for the show 's 30th anniversary in 1999 . The CTW found that although the show was produced for children between the ages of three and five , their viewers had become more sophisticated since its debut and began to watch the show sooner , as early as ten months of age . The producers found that the show 's original format , which consisted of a series of short clips similar to the structure of a magazine , was not necessarily the most effective way to hold young viewers ' attention . They also found that their viewers , especially the younger ones , lost attention with Sesame Street after 40 to 45 minutes . 
 The first way the CTW addressed the issues brought up by their research was by lowering the target age for Sesame Street , from four years to three years . In late 1998 , they created a new 15 @-@ minute segment entitled " Elmo 's World " , hosted by the Muppet Elmo , that was shown at the end of each episode . The segment used traditional elements ( animation , Muppets , music , and live @-@ action film ) , but had a more sustained narrative . " Elmo 's World " followed the same structure each episode , and depended heavily on repetition . It focused on child @-@ centered topics such as balls and dancing , from the perspective of a three @-@ year @-@ old child , and was " designed to foster exploration , imagination , and curiosity " . Instead of an adult providing narration , Elmo led the child through the action . 
 In 2002 , Sesame Street 's producers went further in changing the show to reflect its younger demographic and increase in their viewers ' sophistication . They decided , after the show 's 33rd season , to expand upon the " Elmo 's World " concept by , as San Francisco Chronicle TV critic Tim Goodman called it , " deconstructing " the show . They changed the structure of the entire show to a more narrative format , making the show easier for young children to navigate . Arlene Sherman , a co @-@ executive producer for 25 years and one of the creators of " Elmo 's World " , called the show 's new look " startlingly different " . 
 = = Development and filming = = 
 Long @-@ time Sesame Street writer Judy Freudberg came up with the idea of creating a segment with " an entirely different format " from the rest of the show during the CTW 's workshops , and writer Tony Geiss further developed the idea with her . Freudberg stated that the concept " was radical because we had never veered from that magazine mosaic and had never given any character more than another character to do " . 
 Animator Mo Willems came up with the idea of creating a less @-@ realistic setting compared to the rest of the show . The segment presented Elmo moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer @-@ generated animation , which looked like " a child 's squiggly crayon drawing come to life " created by the host , and with " a stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness feel to it " . The segment was filmed at a different time than the rest of the season , much of it in front of a blue screen , with animation and digital effects added later . Kevin Clash was Elmo 's principal puppeteer for " Elmo 's World " . For more complicated shots that showed Elmo 's entire body , a puppet called " Active Elmo " was operated with assistance from other puppeteers ; the puppet was also filmed in front of a blue screen and edited later . 
 In addition to Freudberg and Geiss , other writers of " Elmo 's World " included Emily Kingsley and Molly Boylan . The theme song was based upon a song Geiss wrote called " Elmo 's Song " , with lyrics changed to fit the segment . Writer Louise Gikow and The New York Times called it " a show within a show " . Clash called it " a <unk> between the child and Elmo " , and felt that its intimacy provided an effective teaching tool . He also called it " an instant success " . Davis compared " Elmo 's World " with the long @-@ running children 's TV show Peewee 's Playhouse . 
 The CTW , as it has done throughout its existence and for all the shows it produced , conducted extensive studies on " Elmo 's World " . They found that the segment had high appeal for children , regardless of their age , sex , and socioeconomic background . Attention and participation such as hand @-@ clapping , moving along with the music , and counting along with the characters increased with repeated viewing . 
 = = Characters = = 
 The Muppet Elmo , who represented the three- to four @-@ year @-@ old child , was chosen as host of " Elmo 's World " because he had always tested well with Sesame Street 's younger viewers . Elmo was created in 1979 and was performed by various puppeteers , including Richard Hunt , but did not become what his eventual portrayer Kevin Clash called a " phenomenon " until Clash took over the role in 1983 . Elmo became , as writer Michael Davis reported , " the embodiment " of Sesame Street , and " the marketing wonder of our age " when five million " Tickle Me Elmo " dolls were sold in 1996 . Clash believed the " Tickle Me Elmo " phenomenon made Elmo a household name and led to the " Elmo 's World " segment . Clash called " Elmo 's World " " a colorful , lively celebration of creativity " and " one of the most imaginative endeavors I 've ever been involved in " . He stated that the segment provided him with new challenges and opportunities for " creative risk @-@ taking " . 
 According to Clash and Gikow , Elmo 's pet goldfish Dorothy and the members of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo to do all the talking , and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen . Dorothy 's silence allowed children to fill in the blanks , and her curiosity , which was created and enhanced by Elmo 's imagination , allowed the writers and researchers to insert the curriculum lessons they want to convey . Up to nine goldfish were used per episode , so they could be replaced when necessary . Several fish were needed each season , and the surviving <unk> were given good homes afterwards . 
 Mr. Noodle was played by Broadway actor Bill Irwin , who had previously worked with Sherman in short films for Sesame Street . When he became unavailable , Sherman asked her friend Michael Jeter to replace Irwin as Mr. Noodle 's brother Mr. Noodle . Jeter was in the role beginning in 2000 , until his death in 2003 . Kristin Chenoweth played Mr. Noodle 's sister Ms. Noodle , and Sarah Jones played Mr. Noodle 's other sister Miss Noodle . According to Freudberg , " Mr. Noodle , who never speaks , is all about trial and error . When you throw him a hat , he acts like he 's never seen one before . Kids feel empowered watching him because they can do what he can 't " .

 " Elmo 's World " remained popular throughout its run , especially for the younger viewers for which it was designed . In 2009 , when " Elmo 's World " temporarily ceased production , the producers of Sesame Street began taking steps to increase the age of their viewers and to increase their ratings . By the end of the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , 3 @-@ year @-@ old viewers had increased by 41 % , 4 @-@ year @-@ olds by 4 % , and 5 @-@ year @-@ olds by 21 % . According to The New York Times , executive producer Carol @-@ Lynn Parente " was itching to revamp the final segment " even before production of " Elmo 's World " ended , but was prevented by the apparent satisfaction of the viewers and by tight budgets . They were also reluctant to replace the segment ; as writer Joey Mazzarino explained , it was " an emotionally charged process " because Freudberg had become ill and was not present for the discussions about it . 
 Although " Elmo 's World " was replaced by " Elmo the Musical " in 2012 , it continued to appear on repeats of Sesame Street , on DVDs , and on the show 's website , which sold products related to the segment . 
 = Lisa 's Sax = 
 " Lisa 's Sax " is the third episode of The Simpsons ' ninth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 19 , 1997 to overwhelmingly positive reviews . In the series ' sixth flashback episode , it is explained how Lisa got her saxophone . The episode was executive produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss and was the first episode Jean wrote by himself as all of his previous writing credits had been shared with Reiss . It was directed by Dominic Polcino and guest starred <unk> Finkel , who appeared as himself portraying Krusty in a film . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Homer and Bart are watching television when they are interrupted by Lisa playing her saxophone in her bedroom . Bart enters Lisa 's bedroom and tries to grab the saxophone from her , but he inadvertently tosses it out the window . It lands in the middle of the street and is run over by a car , a truck , and a man riding a tricycle , and stomped on by Nelson Muntz . In a period of mourning , Lisa reveals she cannot remember ever not having that saxophone , so Homer recounts the instrument 's origins . 
 In a flashback to 1990 , Bart goes to his first day of school , but things do not go so well for him and he becomes depressed . It is during discussions of Bart 's future that the school psychologist realizes the young Lisa is very intelligent , telling Homer and Marge that they need to nurture her gifted spirit . They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee costs $ 6 @,@ 000 . Meanwhile , a terrible heat wave hits Springfield and Homer saves $ 200 to buy an air conditioner . Marge , however , asks Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa . At the school , Bart talks with his future friend Milhouse and makes a farting sound , which Milhouse finds amusing . Encouraged , Bart entertains a group of children and sets out on his path to become the school prankster . 
 On his way to purchase a new air conditioner , Homer discovers that a musical instrument is a way to encourage a gifted child , and subsequently sacrifices his air conditioner money to buy Lisa her first saxophone . In the present , Marge mentions that there is some money in the air conditioner account , so Homer decides to buy another saxophone for Lisa . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Lisa 's Sax " is the first episode that Al Jean had ever been credited as having written by himself . Before this episode , all of his writing credits had been shared with Mike Reiss . The episode was written with a small staff that consisted of Jean , Reiss and David Stern , among others . According to Reiss , the final episode contained 80 – 90 % of Jean 's original script . It is the sixth flashback episode done by the show . " The Way We Was " was the first flashback episode and in it , Homer graduated from high school in 1974 and that made it difficult to have a realistic timeframe as this episode is set in 1990 . Jean conceived the idea for the All in the Family style opening while waiting to get tickets to the O.J. Simpson murder trial . The episode was very short and the clip of Lisa playing the sax at the end was added to lengthen it . 
 The pastel drawing of Krusty was drawn entirely by Dominic Polcino , who revealed it was the only piece of original artwork created solely by him that was featured in an episode . He created the pastel drawing with this in mind . It was an easy episode for Polcino to direct due to the lack of crowds and being a " grounded episode " . This is the last episode in which Doris Grau has a speaking role as Lunchlady Doris , although this episode aired nearly two years after her death . It would also mark the final time the character would speak until Season 18 's " The Mook , the Chef , the Wife and Her Homer " when she was voiced by Tress MacNeille . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 While telling Bart and Lisa about 1990 , Homer says , " Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with [ ... ] crudely drawn filler material . " This is a reference to The Simpsons 's debut as " bumpers " airing before and after commercials on The Tracey Ullman Show . The song " Those Were the Days " parodies the opening credits of the television show All in the Family . One of the people who run over the saxophone is a man on a tricycle , who promptly falls over . This is a reference to the show Rowan & Martin 's Laugh @-@ In . At the beginning of the flashback , the song " Don 't Worry , Be Happy " by Bobby McFerrin can be heard . In the flashback , Dr. Hibbert fashioned his hair and attire like Mr. T in The A @-@ Team . Homer can be seen watching Twin Peaks and The Giant is then shown waltzing with the White Horse . In King Toot 's music store , when Homer buys Lisa her first saxophone , there is a guitar in the background that is similar to Eddie Van Halen 's " <unk> " guitar . The photo beside Kent Brockman on the news has him modeled after the <unk> Girl .

 In its original broadcast , " Lisa 's Sax " finished 51st in ratings for the week of October 13 – 19 , 1997 , with a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 2 , equivalent to approximately 8 @.@ 0 million viewing households . It was the second highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following King of the Hill . 
 The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , called it " a terrific episode , full of amusing self @-@ referential wit and it is especially nice to finally discover what it was that caused Bart to go down the path to the dark side . " Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode , saying it is " not only very funny , but it 's also loaded with Simpson heart . " A review of The Simpsons season 9 DVD release in The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune highlighted " Lisa 's Sax " along with " All Singing , All Dancing " and " Trash of the Titans " as some of the more memorable episodes of the series . Stephen Becker of The Dallas Morning News noted that season 9 " has a special affinity for Lisa " , and highlighted this episode along with " Das Bus " and " Lisa the Simpson " in his review of the DVD .

 = Hugh Trenchard , 1st Viscount Trenchard = 
 Marshal of the Royal Air Force Hugh Montague Trenchard , 1st Viscount Trenchard , GCB , OM , GCVO , DSO ( 3 February 1873 – 10 February 1956 ) was a British officer who was instrumental in establishing the Royal Air Force . He has been described as the Father of the Royal Air Force . 
 During his formative years Trenchard struggled academically , failing many examinations and only just succeeding in meeting the minimum standard for commissioned service in the British Army . As a young infantry officer , Trenchard served in India and with the outbreak of the Boer War , he volunteered for service in South Africa . While fighting the Boers , Trenchard was critically wounded and as a result of his injury , he lost a lung , was partially paralysed and returned to Great Britain . On medical advice Trenchard travelled to Switzerland to recuperate and boredom saw him taking up <unk> . After a heavy crash , Trenchard found that his paralysis was gone and that he could walk unaided . Following further recuperation , Trenchard returned to active service in South Africa . 
 After the end of the Boer War , Trenchard saw service in Nigeria where he was involved in efforts to bring the interior under settled British rule and quell intertribal violence . During his time in West Africa , Trenchard commanded the Southern Nigeria Regiment for several years . 
 In Summer 1912 , Trenchard learned to fly and gained his aviator 's certificate ( No. 270 ) on 31 July flying a Henry Farman biplane of the Sopwith School of Flying at Brooklands . He was subsequently appointed as second in command of the Central Flying School . He held several senior positions in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I , serving as the commander of the Royal Flying Corps in France from 1915 to 1917 . In 1918 , he briefly served as the first Chief of the Air Staff before taking up command of the Independent Air Force in France . Returning as Chief of the Air Staff under Winston Churchill in 1919 , Trenchard spent the following decade securing the future of the Royal Air Force . He was Metropolitan Police Commissioner in the 1930s and a defender of the RAF in his later years . Trenchard is recognized today as one of the early advocates of strategic bombing . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hugh Montague Trenchard was born at Windsor Lodge on Haines Hill in Taunton , England on 3 February 1873 . He was the third child and second son of Henry Montague Trenchard and his wife Georgina Louisa Catherine Tower . Trenchard 's father was a captain in the King 's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and his mother was the daughter of the Royal Navy captain John McDowall Skene . Although in the 1870s the <unk> were living in an unremarkable fashion , their forebears had played notable roles in English history . The family claimed descent from Raoul de <unk> , a knight and one of the close companions of William the Conqueror who fought alongside him at the Battle of Hastings . Other notable ancestors were Sir Thomas Trenchard , a High Sheriff of Dorset in the 16th century and Sir John Trenchard , the Secretary of State under William III . 
 When Hugh Trenchard was two , the family moved to <unk> , a farm @-@ cum @-@ manor house less than three miles ( 4 km ) from the centre of Taunton . The country setting meant that the young Trenchard could enjoy an outdoor life , including spending time hunting rabbits and other small animals with the rifle he was given on his eighth birthday . It was during his junior years that Trenchard and his siblings were educated at home by a resident tutor , whom Trenchard did not respect . Unfortunately for Trenchard 's education , the tutor was neither strict enough nor skillful enough to overcome the children 's mischievous attempts to avoid receiving instruction . As a consequence , Trenchard did not excel academically ; however , his enthusiasm for games and riding was evident . 
 At the age of 10 , Trenchard was sent to board at Allens Preparatory School near Botley in Hampshire . Although he did well at arithmetic , he struggled with the rest of the curriculum . However , Trenchard 's parents were not greatly concerned by his educational difficulties , believing that it would be no impediment to him following a military career . Georgina Trenchard wanted her son to follow her father 's profession and enter the Royal Navy . In 1884 , Trenchard was moved to Dover where he attended Hammond 's , a cramming school for prospective entrants to HMS Britannia . Trenchard failed the Navy 's entrance papers , and at the age of 13 he was sent to the Reverend Albert Pritchard 's crammer , Hill Lands in <unk> , Berkshire . Hill Lands prepared its pupils for Army commissions and although Trenchard excelled at rugby , as before he did not apply himself to his studies . 
 In 1889 , when Hugh Trenchard was 16 years old , his father , who had become a solicitor , was declared bankrupt . After initially being removed from Hill Lands , the young Trenchard was only able to return thanks to the charity of his relatives . Trenchard failed the Woolwich examinations twice and was then relegated to applying for the Militia which had lower entry standards . Even the Militia 's examinations proved difficult for Trenchard and he failed in 1891 and 1892 . During this time , Trenchard underwent a period of training as a probationary subaltern with the Forfar and Kincardine Artillery . Following his return to Pritchard 's , Trenchard finally achieved a bare pass in March 1893 . At the age of 20 , he was gazetted as a second @-@ lieutenant in the Second Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and posted to India . 
 = = Early military career = = 
 = = = India = = = 
 Trenchard arrived in India in late 1893 , joining his regiment at Sialkot in the Punjab . Not long after his arrival , Trenchard was called upon to make a speech at a mess dinner night . It was common practice for the youngest subaltern to make such a speech and Trenchard was expected to cover several highlights of the Royal Scots Fusiliers ' history . Instead , he simply said " I am deeply proud to belong to this great regiment " , followed by " I hope one day I shall live to command it . " His ' speech ' was received with hoots of incredulous laughter , although some appreciated his nerve . 
 Young officers stationed in India in the 1890s enjoyed many social and sporting diversions and Trenchard did little militarily . While every regiment was required to undertake a period of duty beyond the Khyber Pass , for the most part conditions of peace and prosperity were evident and Trenchard was able to engage in various sporting activities . In early 1894 he won the All @-@ India Rifle Championship . After his success at shooting , Trenchard set about establishing a battalion polo team . Being of the infantry , his regiment had no history of playing polo and there were many obstacles for Trenchard to overcome . However , within six months the battalion polo team was competing and holding its own . It was during a polo match in 1896 that Trenchard first met Winston Churchill , with whom he clashed on the field of play . Trenchard 's sporting prowess saved his reputation among his fellow officers . In other respects he did not fit in ; lacking social graces and choosing to converse little , he was nicknamed " the camel " , as like the beast he neither drank nor spoke . 
 It was also during Trenchard 's time in India that he took up reading . His first choice was for biographies , particularly of British heroes . Trenchard kept the long hours he spent reading quiet , but in so doing succeeded in providing himself with an education where the service <unk> had failed . However , in military terms Trenchard was dissatisfied . He failed to see any action during his time in India , missing out on his regiment 's turn at the frontier , as he was sent to England on sick leave for a hernia operation . 
 With the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899 , he applied several times to rejoin his old battalion which had been sent to the Cape as part of the expeditionary corps . Trenchard 's requests were rejected by his Colonel , and when the Viceroy Lord Curzon , who was concerned about the drain of leaders to South Africa , banned the dispatch of any further officers , Trenchard 's prospects for seeing action looked bleak . However , a year or two previously , it had so happened that Trenchard had been promised help or advice from Sir Edmond Elles , as a gesture of thanks after rescuing a poorly planned rifle @-@ shooting contest from disaster . By 1900 , Elles was Military Secretary to Lord Curzon and Trenchard ( recently promoted to captain ) sent a priority signal to Elles requesting that he be permitted to rejoin his unit overseas . This bold move worked , and Trenchard received his orders for South Africa several weeks later . 
 = = = South Africa = = = 
 On his arrival in South Africa , Trenchard rejoined the Royal Scots Fusiliers and in July 1900 he was ordered to raise and train a mounted company within the 2nd Battalion . The Boers were accomplished horsemen and the tactics of the day placed a heavy strain upon the British cavalry . Accordingly , the British sought to raise mounted infantry units and Trenchard 's polo playing experiences led to him being selected to raise a mounted unit for service west of Johannesburg . Part of Trenchard 's new company consisted of a group of volunteer Australian horsemen who , thus far being under @-@ employed , had largely been noticed for excessive drinking , gambling and debauchery . 
 Trenchard 's company came under the command of the 6th ( Fusilier ) Brigade which was headquartered at Krugersdorp . During September and early October 1900 Trenchard 's riders were involved in several skirmishes in the surrounding countryside . On 5 October the 6th Brigade , including Trenchard , departed Krugersdorp with the intention of drawing the Boers into battle on the plain where they might be defeated . However , before the Brigade could reach the plain it had to pass through undulating terrain which favoured the Boer guerrilla tactics . 
 The Brigade travelled by night and at dawn on 9 October the Ayrshire Yeomanry , who were in the vanguard , disturbed a Boer encampment . The Boers fled on horseback and Trenchard with his Australians pursued them for 10 miles ( 16 km ) . The Boers , finding themselves unable to shake off Trenchard 's unit , led them into a trap . The Boers rode up a steep slope and disappeared into the valley beyond . When Trenchard made the ridge he saw the <unk> farmhouse with smoke coming from the chimney . It appeared to Trenchard that the Boers thought they had got away and were eating breakfast unawares . Trenchard placed his troops on the heights around the building and after half an hour 's observation , he led a patrol of four men down towards the farmhouse . The remainder of Trenchard 's troops were to close in on his signal . However , when Trenchard and his patrol reached the valley floor and broke cover , the Boers opened fire from about a dozen points and bullets whistled past Trenchard and his men . He pressed forward reaching the sheltering wall of the farmhouse . As he headed for the door , Trenchard was hit by a Boer bullet to the chest . The Australians , seeing their leader fall , descended from the heights to engage the Boers at close quarters in and around the farmhouse . Many of the Boers were killed or wounded , a few fled and several were taken prisoner . Trenchard being critically wounded was medically evacuated to Krugersdorp . 
 = = Medical treatment and convalescence = = 
 After Trenchard was brought to the hospital in Krugersdorp , he slipped from semi @-@ consciousness into unconsciousness . The surgeons believed that he would die as the bullet had punctured his left lung and they had removed six and a half pints of blood from his pleural cavity through a tube . On the third day , Trenchard regained consciousness but spent most of that day sleeping . After three weeks , Trenchard had shown some improvement and was moved to Johannesburg where he made further progress . However , when he tried to rise from his bed , Trenchard discovered that he was unable to put weight on his feet , leading him to suspect that he was partially paralysed . He was next moved to <unk> for convalescing and there Trenchard confirmed that he was suffering from partial paralysis below the waist . The doctors surmised that after passing through his lung , the bullet had damaged his spine . 
 In December 1900 , Trenchard returned to England , arriving by hospital ship at Southampton . He hobbled with the aid of sticks down the gangplank where his concerned parents met him . As a disabled soldier without independent financial means , Trenchard was now at his lowest point . He spent the next fortnight at the Mayfair nursing home for disabled officers which was run by the Red Cross . Trenchard 's case came to the attention of Lady Dudley , by whose philanthropic efforts the Mayfair nursing home operated . Through her generosity she arranged for Trenchard to see a specialist who told Trenchard that he needed to spend several months in Switzerland where the air was likely to be of benefit to his lung . Trenchard and his family could not afford the expense and Trenchard was too embarrassed to explain the situation . However , without asking any questions , Lady Dudley presented Trenchard with a cheque to cover the costs . 
 On Sunday 30 December , Trenchard arrived in St Moritz to begin his Swiss convalescence . Boredom saw him take up <unk> as it did not require much use of his legs . Initially he was prone to leave the run and end up in the snow , but after some days of practice he usually managed to stay on track . It was during a heavy crash from the Cresta Run that his spine was somehow readjusted , enabling him to walk freely immediately after regaining consciousness . Around a week later , Trenchard won the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club 's Freshman and Novices ' Cups for 1901 ; a remarkable triumph for a man who had been unable to walk unaided only a few days before . 
 On arriving back in England , Trenchard visited Lady Dudley to thank her and then set about engineering his return to South Africa . His lung was not fully healed , causing him pain and leaving him breathless . Furthermore , the War Office were sceptical about Trenchard 's claim to be fully fit and were disinclined to allow him to forgo his remaining nine months of sick leave . Trenchard then took several months of tennis coaching in order to strengthen his remaining lung . Early in the summer of 1901 he entered two tennis competitions , reaching the semi @-@ finals both times and gaining favourable press coverage . He then sent the newspaper clippings to the doctors at the War Office , arguing that this tennis ability proved he was fit for active service . Not waiting for a reply , Trenchard boarded a troop ship in May 1901 , passing himself off as a volunteer for a second tour of duty .

 = = = Back in South Africa = = = 
 On Trenchard 's return to South Africa he made his way to Pretoria , arriving there in late July 1901 . He was assigned to a company of the 12th Mounted Infantry where patrolling duties required long days in the saddle . Trenchard 's wound still caused considerable pain ; the entry and exit scars frequently bled . 
 Later in the year , Trenchard was summoned to see Kitchener , who was by then the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief . He was tasked with reorganizing a demoralized mounted infantry company , which was completed in under a month . Kitchener then sent Trenchard to D <unk> in the Cape Colony to expedite the training of a new corps of mounted infantry . Kitchener summoned Trenchard for the third time in October 1901 , this time sending Trenchard on a mission to capture the Boer Government who were in hiding . Kitchener had received intelligence on their location and he hoped to damage the morale of Boer commandos at large by sending a small group of men to capture the Boer Government . Trenchard was accompanied by a column of so @-@ called loyalist Boers whose motives he suspected . Also with Trenchard were several British NCOs and nine mixed race guides . After riding through the night , Trenchard 's party were ambushed the next morning . Trenchard and his men took cover and gave fight . After Trenchard 's column had suffered casualties , the ambush party withdrew . Although this last mission failed , Trenchard was praised for his efforts with a mention in dispatches . 
 Trenchard spent the remainder of 1901 on patrolling duties , and in early 1902 he was appointed acting commander of the 23rd Mounted Infantry Regiment . During the last few months of the War , Trenchard only once got to lead his Regiment into action . In response to Boer cattle rustling , Zulu raiders crossed the border into the Transvaal and the 23rd Mounted Infantry Regiment took action . After peace terms were agreed in May 1902 , Trenchard was involved in supervising the disarming of the Boers and later took leave . In July , the 23rd Mounted Infantry was recalled to Middleburg four hundred miles to the south and after the trek Trenchard occupied himself with polo and race meetings . Trenchard was promoted to brevet major in August 1902 . 
 = = = Nigeria = = = 
 Following the end of the Boer War , Trenchard decided to apply for service in the West African Frontier Force and was granted the position of Deputy Commandant of the Southern Nigeria Regiment with the promise that he was entitled to lead all regimental expeditions . On arrival in Nigeria in December 1903 , Trenchard initially had some difficulty in getting his Commanding Officer to allow him to lead the upcoming expedition and only replaced his superior by going over his head . 
 Once established , Trenchard spent the next six years on various expeditions to the interior patrolling , surveying and mapping an area of 10 @,@ 000 square miles which later came to be known as Biafra . In the occasional clashes with the Ibo tribesmen , Trenchard gained decisive victories . The many tribesmen who surrendered were given jobs as road builders and thereby began to develop the country as part of the British Empire . From summer 1904 to the late summer 1905 , Trenchard was acting Commandant of the Southern Nigeria Regiment . He was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order in 1906 and was Commandant with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel from 1908 onwards . 
 = = England and Ireland = = 
 In early 1910 , Trenchard became seriously ill and after several months he returned home , this time with a liver abscess . Back in England , Trenchard did not recover quickly and probably prolonged his convalescence by over @-@ exertion . However , by the late summer he was well enough to take his parents on holiday to the West Country . 
 October 1910 saw Trenchard posted to Londonderry where the Second Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers were garrisoned . Trenchard was reduced from a temporary lieutenant @-@ colonel to major and made a company commander . As before , he occupied himself with playing polo and he took up hunting . Finding peace @-@ time regimental life dull , Trenchard sought to expand his area of responsibility by attempting to re @-@ organize his fellow officers ' administrative procedures , which they resented . Trenchard also clashed with Colonel Stuart , his commanding officer , who told him that the town was too small for both of them and by February 1912 had resorted to applying for employment with various colonial defence forces without success . 
 = = Flying school = = 
 During his time in Ireland , Trenchard received a letter from Captain Eustace Loraine , urging him to take up flying . Trenchard and Loraine had been friends in Nigeria , and on his return to England , Loraine had learnt to fly . After some effort , Trenchard persuaded his Commanding Officer to grant him three months of paid leave so that he might train as a pilot . Trenchard arrived in London on 6 July 1912 , only to discover that Captain Loraine had been killed in a flying accident on the previous day . At the age of 39 , Trenchard was just short of 40 , the maximum age for military student pilots at the Central Flying School , and so he did not postpone his plan to become an aviator . 
 When Trenchard arrived at Thomas Sopwith 's flying school at Brooklands , he told Sopwith than he only had 10 days to gain his aviator 's certificate . Trenchard succeeded in going solo on 31 July , gaining his Royal Aero Club aviator 's certificate ( No. 270 ) on a Henry Farman biplane . The course had cost £ 75 , involved a meagre two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half weeks tuition and a grand total of 64 minutes in the air . Although Copland Perry , Trenchard 's instructor , noted that teaching him to fly had been " no easy performance " , Trenchard himself had been " a model pupil . " Trenchard 's difficulties were in some measure due to his partial blindness in one eye , a fact he kept secret . 
 Trenchard arrived at Upavon airfield , where the Central Flying School was based , and was assigned to Arthur Longmore 's flight . Bad weather delayed Longmore from assessing his new pupil , and before the weather improved , the School 's Commandant , Captain Godfrey Paine RN had co @-@ opted Trenchard to the permanent staff . Part of Trenchard 's new duties included those of School examiner , and so he set himself a paper , sat it , marked it and awarded himself his ' wings ' . Trenchard 's flying ability still left much to be desired , and Longmore soon discovered his pupil 's deficiencies . Over the following weeks Trenchard spent many hours improving his flying technique . After Trenchard had finished his flying course , he was officially appointed as an instructor . However , Trenchard was a poor pilot , and he did no instructing , instead becoming involved in administrative duties . As a member of the staff , Trenchard set to work organizing training and establishing procedures . He paid particular attention to ensuring that skills were acquired in practical topics such as map reading , signalling and engine mechanics . It was during his time at the Central Flying School that Trenchard earned the nickname " Boom " either for his stentorian utterances or for his low rumbling tones . 
 In September 1912 , Trenchard acted as an air observer during the Army Manoeuvres . His experiences and actions developed his understanding of the military utility of flying . The following September , Trenchard was appointed Assistant Commandant and promoted to temporary lieutenant @-@ colonel . Trenchard 's paths crossed once more with Winston Churchill , who was by then First Lord of the Admiralty , and learning to fly at Eastchurch and Upavon . Trenchard formed a distinctly unfavourable opinion of Churchill 's ability as a pilot . 
 = = World War I = = 
 = = = Officer Commanding the Military Wing = = = 
 With the outbreak of World War I , Trenchard was appointed Officer Commanding the Military Wing of the Royal Flying Corps , replacing Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Sykes . This appointment put Trenchard in charge of the Royal Flying Corps in Great Britain , which retained one third of the Corps ' total strength . Trenchard 's headquarters were at Farnborough and being disappointed about remaining in England , he applied to rejoin his old regiment in France . However , the head of the RFC , General Sir David Henderson , refused to release him . Trenchard 's new duties included providing replacements and raising new squadrons for service on the continent . Trenchard initially set himself a target of 12 squadrons . However , Sefton Brancker , the Assistant Director of Military Aeronautics , suggested that this should be raised to 30 and Lord Kitchener later set the target at 60 . In order to begin the task of creating these squadrons , Trenchard commandeered his old civilian training school at Brooklands and then used its aircraft and equipment as a starting point for the establishment of new training schools elsewhere . 
 In early October 1914 , Kitchener sent for Trenchard and tasked him with providing a battle @-@ worthy squadron forthwith . The squadron was to be used to support land and naval forces seeking to prevent the German flanking manoeuvres during the Race to the Sea . On 7 October , only 36 hours later , No. 6 Squadron flew to Belgium , the first of many additional squadrons to be provided . 
 Later in October , detailed planning for a major reorganization of the Flying Corps ' command structure took place . Henderson offered Trenchard command of the soon @-@ to @-@ be created First Wing . Trenchard accepted the offer on the basis that he would not be subordinated to Sykes , whom he distrusted . The next month , the Military Wing was abolished and its units based in Great Britain were re @-@ grouped as the Administrative Wing . Command of the Administrative Wing was given to Lieutenant Colonel E B Ashmore . 
 = = = Commander of the First Wing = = = 
 Trenchard took up command of the First Wing in November 1914 and established his headquarters at Merville . On his arrival Trenchard discovered that Sykes was to replace Henderson as Commander of the Royal Flying Corps in the Field , making Sykes Trenchard 's immediate superior . Trenchard bore Sykes some animosity and their working relationship was troubled . Trenchard appealed to Kitchener , by then the Secretary of State for War , threatening to resign . Trenchard 's discomfort was relieved when in December 1914 Kitchener ordered that Henderson resume command of the Royal Flying Corps in the Field . Trenchard 's First Wing consisted of Nos Two and Three Squadrons and flew in support of the IV Corps and the Indian Corps . After the First Army under General Haig came into being in December , the First Wing provided support to the First Army . 
 In early January 1915 , Haig summoned Trenchard to explain what might be achieved in the air . During the meeting Haig brought Trenchard into his confidence regarding his plans for a March attack in the Merville / Neuve Chapelle region . After aerial photographic reconnaissance had been gathered , the Allied plans were reworked in February . During the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March , the RFC and especially the First Wing supported the land offensive . This was the first time that aircraft were used as bombers with explosives strapped to the wings and fuselage as opposed to being released by hand which had happened earlier in the War . However , the bombing from the air had little effect and the artillery disregarded the information provided by the RFC 's airmen . Prior to Haig 's offensives at Ypres and Aubers Ridge in April and May , Trenchard 's camera crews flew reconnaissance sorties over the German lines . Despite the detailed information this provided and the improved air @-@ artillery cooperation during the battles , the offensives were inconclusive . At the end of this engagement Henderson offered Trenchard the position as his chief of staff . Trenchard declined the offer , citing his unsuitability for the role although his ambition for command may have been the real reason . In any case , this did not stop his promotion to full colonel in June 1915 . 
 = = = Commander of the Royal Flying Corps = = = 
 On Henderson 's return to the War Office in the summer of 1915 , Trenchard was promoted to brigadier @-@ general and appointed Officer Commanding the RFC in France . Trenchard was to serve as the head of the RFC in the field until the early days of 1918 . In late 1915 when Haig was appointed as commander of the British Expeditionary Force , Haig and Trenchard re @-@ established their partnership , this time at a higher level . In March the following year , with the RFC expanding , Trenchard was promoted to major @-@ general . 
 Trenchard 's time in command was characterized by three priorities . First was his emphasis on support to and co @-@ ordination with ground forces . This support started with reconnaissance and artillery co @-@ ordination and later encompassed tactical low @-@ level bombing of enemy ground forces . While Trenchard did not oppose the strategic bombing of Germany in principle , he rejected moves to divert his forces on to long @-@ range bombing missions as he believed the strategic role to be less important and his resource to be too limited . Secondly , he stressed the importance of morale , not only of his own airmen , but more generally the detrimental effect that the presence of an aircraft had upon the morale of opposing ground troops . Finally , Trenchard had an unswerving belief in the importance of offensive action . Although this belief was widely held by senior British commanders , the RFC 's offensive posture resulted in the loss of many men and machines and some doubted its effectiveness . 
 Following the Gotha raids on London in the summer of 1917 , the Government considered creating an air force by merging the RFC and the Royal Naval Air Service . Trenchard opposed this move believing that it would dilute the air support required by the ground forces in France . By October he realized that the creation of an air force was inevitable and , seeing that he was the obvious candidate to become the new Chief of the Air Staff , he attempted to bring about a scheme whereby he would retain control of the flying units on the Western Front . In this regard Trenchard was unsuccessful and he was succeeded in France by Major @-@ General John Salmond . 
 = = = Chief of the Air Staff ( 1st appointment ) = = = 
 After the Air Force Bill received the Royal Assent on 29 November 1917 , there followed a period of political manoeuvring and speculation over who would take up the new posts of Air Minister , Chief of the Air Staff and other senior positions within soon @-@ to @-@ be created Air Ministry . Trenchard was summoned back from France , crossing the Channel on a destroyer on the morning of 16 December . At around 3 pm , Trenchard met newspaper proprietor Lord Rothermere who had recently been appointed as Air Minister . Rothermere offered Trenchard the post of Chief of the Air Staff and before Trenchard could respond , Rothermere explained that Trenchard 's support would be useful to him as he was about to launch a press campaign against Sir Douglas Haig and Sir William Robertson , the Chief of the Imperial General Staff . Trenchard flatly refused the job , being personally loyal to Haig and antipathetic to political intrigue . Rothermere and his brother Lord Northcliffe , who was also present , then spent over 12 hours acrimoniously debating with Trenchard . The brothers pointed out that if Trenchard refused , they would use the fact to attack Haig on the false premise that Haig had refused to release Trenchard . Trenchard defended Haig 's policy of constant attack , arguing that it had been preferable to standing on the defensive and he also had maintained an offensive posture throughout the War which , like the infantry , had resulted in the Flying Corps taking dreadful casualties . In the end , the brothers wore Trenchard down and he accepted the post on the condition that he first be permitted to consult Haig . After meeting with Haig , Trenchard wrote to Rothermere , accepting the post . 
 = = = Disputes and resignation = = = 
 The New Year saw Trenchard made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and appointed Chief of the Air Staff on the newly formed Air Council . Trenchard began work on 18 January and during his first month at the Air Ministry , he clashed with Rothermere over several issues . First , Rothermere 's tendency to disregard his professional advisors in favour of outside experts irritated Trenchard . Secondly , Rothermere insisted that Trenchard claim as many men for the RAF as possible even if they might be better employed in the other services . Finally and most significantly , they disagreed over proper future use of air power which Trenchard judged as being vital in preventing a repeat of the strategic stalemate which had occurred along the Western Front . Also during this time Trenchard resisted pressure from several press barons to support an " air warfare scheme " which would have seen the British armies withdrawn from France and the defeat of Germany entrusted to the RAF . Despite the arguments and his differences with Rothermere , Trenchard was able to put in place planning for the merger of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service . However , as the weeks went on , Trenchard and Rothermere became increasingly estranged and a low point was reached in mid @-@ March when Trenchard discovered that Rothermere had promised the Navy 4000 aircraft for anti @-@ submarine duties . He accorded the highest priority to air operations on the Western Front : there were fewer than 400 spare aircraft in Great Britain . On 18 March , Trenchard and Rothermere exchanged letters , Trenchard expressing his dissatisfaction and Rothermere curtly replying . The following day Trenchard sent Rothermere a letter of resignation and although Rothermere called for Trenchard and asked him to remain , Trenchard only agreed to defer the date until after 1 April when the Royal Air Force would officially come into being . 
 After the Germans overran the British Fifth Army on 21 March , Trenchard ordered all available reserves of aircrew , engines and aircraft to be speedily transported to France . Reports reached Trenchard on 26 March that concentrations of Flying Corps ' machines were stopping German advances . On 5 April , Trenchard travelled to France , inspecting squadrons and updating his understanding of the air situation . On his return , he briefed Lloyd George and several other ministers on air activity and the general situation . 
 On 10 April , Rothermere informed Trenchard that the War Cabinet had accepted his resignation and Trenchard was offered his old job in France . Trenchard refused the offer saying that replacing Salmond at the height of battle would be " damnable " . Three days later Major @-@ General Frederick Sykes replaced Trenchard as Chief of the Air Staff . On the following Monday , Trenchard was summoned to Buckingham Palace where King George listened to Trenchard 's account of the events which caused him to resign . Trenchard then wrote to the Prime Minister stating the facts of his case and pointing out that in the course of the affair , Rothermere had stated his intention to resign also . Trenchard 's letter was circulated among the Cabinet with a vindictive response written by Rothermere . Around the same time , the question of Rothermere 's general competence as Air Minister was brought to the attention of Lloyd George . Rothermere , realizing his situation , offered his resignation which was made public on 25 April 1918 . 
 = = = In @-@ between duties = = = 
 In the weeks that followed his resignation Trenchard was without a role and he kept a low profile , avoiding the Press and making no public comments . The new Air Minister , Sir William Weir , under pressure to find a position for Trenchard , offered him command of the yet to be formed Independent Force which was to conduct long @-@ range bombing operations against Germany . Instead , Trenchard , seeking equal status with Sykes , argued for a reorganization of the RAF which would have seen himself appointed as the RAF 's commander of fighting operations while Sykes would have been left to deal with administrative matters . Weir did not accept his proposal and instead gave Trenchard several options . Trenchard rejected the offer of a proposed new post which would have meant a London @-@ based command of the bombing operations conducted from <unk> , arguing that the responsibility was Newall 's under the direction of Salmond . He also turned down the post of Grand Co @-@ ordinator of British and American air policy and that of Inspector General of the RAF overseas . Weir then offered Trenchard command of all air force units in the Middle East or the post of Inspector @-@ General of the RAF at home but strongly encouraged him to take command of the independent long @-@ range bombing forces in France . 
 Trenchard had many reasons for not accepting any of the posts which he saw as being artificially created , of little value or lacking authority . On 8 May Trenchard was sitting on a bench in Green Park and overheard one naval officer saying to another " I don 't know why the Government should pander to a man who threw in his hand at the height of a battle . If I 'd my way with Trenchard I 'd have him shot . " After Trenchard had walked home , he wrote to Weir accepting command of the as yet unformed Independent Force . 
 = = = Commander of the Independent Air Force = = = 
 After a period of what was officially termed " special duty " in France , Trenchard was appointed GOC Independent Air Force on 15 June 1918 with his headquarters in Nancy . The Independent Air Force continued the task of the VIII Brigade from which it was formed , carrying out intensive strategic bombing attacks on German railways , airfields and industrial centres . Initially , the French general Ferdinand Foch refused to recognize the Independent Air Force which caused some logistical difficulties . The problems were resolved after a meeting of Trenchard and General de Castelnau , who disregarded the concerns about the status of the Independent Air Force and did not block the much needed supplies . Trenchard also improved the links between the RAF and the American Air Service , providing advanced tuition in bombing techniques to American aviators . 
 In September 1918 , Trenchard 's Force indirectly supported the American Air Service during the Battle of Saint @-@ Mihiel , bombing German airfields , supply depots and rail lines . Trenchard 's close co @-@ operation with the Americans and the French was formalized when his command was redesignated the Inter @-@ Allied Independent Air Force in late October 1918 and placed directly under Foch , the supreme commander . When the November armistice came , Trenchard sought and received permission from Foch to return his squadrons to British command . Trenchard was succeeded as commander of the Independent Air Force by his deputy Brigadier @-@ General Courtney . Trenchard departed France in mid @-@ November and returned to Great Britain to take a holiday .

 After two months on the RAF 's inactive list , Trenchard returned to military duties in mid @-@ January 1919 when Sir William Robertson , the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of Home Forces , asked him to take charge of around 5 @,@ 000 mutinying soldiers in Southampton . Putting on his Army general 's uniform he arrived in Southampton with a staff of two , his clerk and Maurice Baring , his aide @-@ de @-@ camp . Trenchard initially attempted to speak to the mutinying soldiers but was heckled and jostled . He then arranged for armed troops to be sent to Southampton and when Trenchard threatened lethal force , the mutineers surrendered , bringing matters to a close without bloodshed .

 In early 1919 , Churchill was appointed Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for Air . While Churchill was preoccupied with implementing post @-@ War defence cuts and the demobilization of the Army , the Chief of the Air Staff , Major @-@ General Frederick Sykes , submitted a paper with what were at the time unrealistic proposals for a large air force of the future . Being dissatisfied with Sykes , Churchill began to consider reinstating Trenchard whose recent performance at Southampton had once more brought him into favour with Churchill . 
 During the first week in February , Trenchard was summoned to London by official telegram . At the War Office , Trenchard met with Churchill , who asked him to come back as Chief of the Air Staff . Trenchard replied that he could not take up the appointment as Sykes was currently in post . After Churchill indicated that Sykes might be appointed Controller of Civil Aviation and made a knight grand cross of the Order of the British Empire , Trenchard agreed to consider the offer . Churchill , not wanting to leave matters hanging , asked Trenchard to provide him with a paper outlining his ideas on the re @-@ organization of the Air Ministry . Trenchard 's brief written statement of the essentials required met with Churchill 's approval and he insisted that Trenchard take the appointment . Trenchard returned to the Air Ministry in mid @-@ February and formally took up post as Chief of the Air Staff on 31 March 1919 . 
 For most of March Trenchard was unable to do much work as he had contracted Spanish flu . During this period he wrote to Katherine Boyle ( née Salvin ) , the widow of his friend and fellow officer James Boyle , whom he knew from his time in Ireland . At Trenchard 's request , Mrs Boyle took on the task of nursing him back to health . Once Trenchard had recovered , he proposed marriage to Katherine Boyle , who refused his offer . Trenchard remained in contact with her and when he proposed marriage again , she accepted . On 17 July 1920 , they were married at St. Margaret 's Church in Westminster . 
 = = = = Establishing the RAF and the struggle for survival = = = = 
 During the summer of 1919 , Trenchard worked on completing the demobilization of the RAF and establishing it on a peace @-@ time basis . This was a sizable task as the RAF was budgeted to shrink from 280 squadrons to around 28 squadrons . It was also during this time that the new RAF officer ranks were decided upon , despite some opposition from members of the Army Council . Trenchard himself was regraded from major @-@ general to air vice @-@ marshal and then promoted to air marshal a few days later . 
 By the autumn of 1919 , the budgetary effects of Lloyd George 's Ten Year Rule were causing Trenchard some difficulty as he sought to develop the institutions of the RAF . He had to argue against the view that the Army and Navy should provide all the support services and education , leaving the RAF only to provide flying training . Trenchard viewed this idea as a precursor to the break @-@ up of the RAF and in spite of the costs , he wanted his own institutions which would develop airmanship and engender the air spirit . Having convinced Churchill of his case , Trenchard oversaw the founding of the RAF ( Cadet ) College at Cranwell as the world 's first military air academy . Later , in 1920 , Trenchard inaugurated the Aircraft Apprentice scheme which provided the RAF with specialist groundcrew for over 70 years . In 1922 , the RAF Staff College at Andover was set up to provide air force @-@ specific training to the RAF 's middle @-@ ranking officers . 
 Late 1919 saw Trenchard created a baronet and granted £ 10 @,@ 000 . Although Trenchard had attained a measure of financial security , the future of the RAF was far from assured . Trenchard judged that the chief threat to his service came from the new First Sea Lord , Admiral Beatty . Looking to take the initiative , Trenchard arranged to see Beatty , meeting with him in early December . Trenchard , arguing that the " air is one and indivisible " , put forward a case for an air force with its own strategic role which also controlled army and navy co @-@ operation squadrons . Beatty did not accept Trenchard 's argument and Trenchard resorted to asking for a 12 months amnesty to put his plans into action . The request appealed to Beatty 's sense of fair play and he agreed to let Trenchard be until the end of 1920 . Around this time Trenchard indicated to Beatty that control over some supporting elements of naval aviation ( but not aircrew or aircraft ) might be returned to the Admiralty . Trenchard also offered Beatty the option of locating the Air Ministry staff who worked in connection with naval aviation at the Admiralty . Beatty declined the offer and later , when no transfer of any naval aviation assets occurred , came to the view that Trenchard had acted in bad faith . 
 During the early 1920s , the continued independent existence of the RAF and its control of naval aviation were subject to a series of Government reviews . The Balfour report of 1921 , the Geddes Axe of 1922 and the Salisbury Committee of 1923 all found in favour of the RAF despite lobbying from the Admiralty and opposition in Parliament . On each occasion Trenchard and his staff officers , supported by Christopher Bullock , worked to show that the RAF provided good value for money and was required for the long @-@ term strategic security of the United Kingdom . 
 Trenchard also sought to secure the future of the RAF by finding a war @-@ fighting role for the new Service . In 1920 he successfully argued that the RAF should take the lead during the operation to restore peace in Somaliland . The success of this small air action then allowed Trenchard to put the case for the RAF 's policing of the British Empire . Trenchard particularly argued for the RAF to take the lead in Iraq at the Cairo Conference of 1921 and in 1922 the RAF was given control of all British Forces in Iraq . The RAF also carried out imperial air policing over India 's North @-@ West Frontier Province . More controversially , in early 1920 , he wrote that the RAF could even suppress " industrial disturbances or risings " in Britain itself . The idea was not to Churchill 's liking and he told Trenchard not to refer to this proposal again .

 By late 1924 , the creation of the reserve air force , known as the Auxiliary Air Force , meant that Trenchard was able to modestly expand the RAF 's strength , and over the next two years 25 auxiliary squadrons were created . It was during this period that he oversaw the introduction of the short @-@ service commission scheme which proved to be useful in providing some of the regular manning on the new squadrons . Trenchard also instigated the University Air Squadron scheme and in 1925 the first three UAS squadrons were formed at Cambridge , London and Oxford . 
 Since the early 1920s Trenchard had supported the development of a flying bomb and by 1927 a prototype , code @-@ named " Larynx " , was successfully tested . However , development costs were not insignificant and in 1928 , when Trenchard applied for further funding , the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet discontinued the project . Following the British failure to win the Schneider Trophy in 1925 , Trenchard ensured that finances were available for an RAF team and the High Speed Flight was formed in preparation for the 1927 race . After the British won in 1927 , Trenchard continued to use Air Ministry funds to support the race , including purchasing two Supermarine S.6 aircraft which won the race in 1929 . Trenchard was criticised by some in the Treasury for wasting money . 
 On 1 January 1927 , Trenchard was promoted from air chief marshal to marshal of the Royal Air Force , becoming the first person to hold the RAF 's highest rank . The following year Trenchard began to feel that he had achieved all he could as Chief of the Air Staff and that he should give way to a younger man . He offered his resignation to the Cabinet in late 1928 , although it was not initially accepted . Around the same time as Trenchard was considering his future , the British Legation and some European diplomatic staff based in Kabul were cut off from the outside world as a result of the civil war in Afghanistan . After word had reached London , the Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain sent for Trenchard who informed Chamberlain that the RAF would be able to rescue the stranded civilians . The Kabul Airlift began on Christmas Eve and took nine weeks to rescue around 600 people . 
 Trenchard continued as Chief of the Air Staff until 1 January 1930 . Immediately after he had relinquished his appointment , Trenchard was created Baron of <unk> in the County of Dorset , entering the House of Lords and becoming the RAF 's first peer . Looking back over Trenchard 's time as Chief of the Air Staff , while he had successfully preserved the RAF , his emphasis on the Air Force providing defence at a comparatively low cost had led to a stagnation and even deterioration in the quality of the Service 's fighting equipment . 
 = = = Metropolitan Police Commissioner = = = 
 After Trenchard had retired from the RAF , he worked as a director of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company , largely disappearing from public life . However , in March 1931 , Ramsay MacDonald asked Trenchard to take the post of Metropolitan Police Commissioner , which after initially declining , Trenchard eventually accepted in October 1931 . Trenchard served as head of the Metropolitan Police until 1935 and during his tenure he instigated several changes . These included limiting membership of the Police Federation , introducing limited terms of employment and the creation of separate career paths for the lower and higher ranks akin to the military system of officer and non @-@ commissioned career streams . Perhaps Trenchard 's most well known achievement during his time as Commissioner was the establishment of the Hendon Police College which originally was the institution from which Trenchard 's junior inspectors graduated before following a career in the higher ranks . Trenchard retired in November 1935 and in his final few months as Police Commissioner , he was made a knight grand cross of the Royal Victorian Order . 
 = = = Later inter @-@ war years = = = 
 During his time as Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Trenchard maintained a keen interest in military affairs . In 1932 , he aroused the Governments displeasure by submitting an unsolicited private paper outlining his idea for the air defence of Singapore . Trenchard 's ideas were rejected and the Cabinet Secretary , Maurice Hankey who chaired the Committee of Imperial Defence was angered by Trenchard 's intervention . Later that year , when the Government was considering entering into an international treaty which would have banned all bomber aircraft , Trenchard wrote to the Cabinet outlining his opposition to the idea . Ultimately the idea was dropped . 
 Trenchard developed a negative view of Hankey whom he saw as being more interested in maintaining unanimity among the service heads than dealing with weaknesses in British defence arrangements . Trenchard began to speak privately against Hankey who , for his part , had no liking for Trenchard . By 1935 , Trenchard privately lobbied for Hankey 's removal on the grounds that the nation 's security was at stake . Following his departure from the Metropolitan Police , Trenchard was free to speak publicly . In December 1935 Trenchard wrote in The Times that the Committee of Imperial Defence should be placed under the chairmanship of a politician . Hankey responded by accusing Trenchard of " trying to stab him in the back . " By 1936 , the idea of bolstering the Committee of Imperial Defence had become a popular point of debate and Trenchard presented his arguments in the House of Lords . In the end the Government conceded and Sir Thomas Inskip was appointed as the Minister for Coordination of Defence . 
 With Hankey and his ban on inter @-@ service disputes gone , the Navy again campaigned for their own air service . The idea of transferring the Fleet Air Arm from Air Ministry to Admiralty control was raised and although Trenchard opposed the move in the Lords , in the Press and in private conversations , he lacked the influence to prevent the transfer , which took place in 1937 . Beyond politics , Trenchard took on the chairmanship of the United Africa Company , which had sought out Trenchard because of his West African knowledge and experience . In 1936 Trenchard was upgraded from Baron to Viscount Trenchard . 
 From late 1936 to 1939 Trenchard spent much of his time travelling overseas on behalf of the companies who employed him as a director . During one visit to Germany in the summer of 1937 , he was hosted at a dinner by Hermann Göring , the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Luftwaffe . Although the evening started in a cordial fashion , it ended in Göring 's opinion that " one day German might will make the whole world tremble " . Trenchard replied that Göring " must be off his head " . In 1937 Newall was appointed Chief of the Air Staff and Trenchard did not hesitate in criticising the new air chief . As an ardent supporter of the bomber , Trenchard found much to disagree with in the air expansion programme , its emphasis on defensive fighter aircraft . Trenchard took to writing directly to the Cabinet and eventually Newall was reduced to imploring Trenchard to exercise some discretion . Trenchard offered his services to the Government on at least two occasions but they were not accepted . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Just after the outbreak of World War II , Chamberlain summoned Trenchard and offered him the job of organizing advanced training for RAF pilots in Canada , possibly as a pretext to remove Trenchard from England . Trenchard turned Chamberlain down , saying that the role required a younger man who had up @-@ to @-@ date knowledge of training matters . Trenchard then spent the remainder of 1939 arguing that the RAF should be used to strike against Germany from its bases in France . It was clear to the Government that Trenchard was dissatisfied and early in 1940 he was offered the job of co @-@ ordinating the camouflaging of England . Trenchard flatly refused this job . Without an official role , Trenchard took it upon himself to spend the spring of 1940 visiting many RAF units , including those of the Advanced Air Striking Force in France . In April , Sir Samuel Hoare , who was again Secretary of State for Air , unsuccessfully attempted to get Trenchard to come back as Chief of the Air Staff . 
 In May 1940 , after the failure of the Norwegian Campaign , Trenchard used his position in the Lords to attack what he saw as the Government 's half @-@ hearted prosecution of the war . When Churchill replaced Chamberlain as Prime Minister , Trenchard was asked to organize the defence of aircraft factories . Trenchard declined this offer on the grounds that he was not interested in helping the general who already had the responsibility . Towards the end of the month , Churchill offered Trenchard a job that would have seen him acting as a general officer commanding all British land , air and sea forces at home should an invasion occur . Trenchard responded by bluntly stating that in order to be effective , the officer with such responsibility would need the military powers of a generalissimo and political power that would come from being Deputy Minister of Defence . Churchill was virtually reduced to apoplexy and did not grant Trenchard the enormous powers he sought . 
 Notwithstanding their disagreement , Trenchard and Churchill remained on good terms and on Churchill 's 66th birthday ( 30 November 1940 ) they took lunch at Chequers . The Battle of Britain had recently concluded and Churchill was full of praise for Trenchard 's pre @-@ War efforts in establishing the RAF . Churchill made Trenchard his last job offer , this time as the <unk> of Military Intelligence . Trenchard seriously considered the offer but declined it by letter two days later , chiefly because he felt that the job required a degree of tact which he would have been unable to supply . 
 From mid @-@ 1940 onwards , Trenchard realized that by his rash demands in May he had excluded himself from a pivotal role in the British war effort . He then took it upon himself to act as an unofficial Inspector @-@ General for the RAF , visiting deployed squadrons across Europe and North Africa on morale @-@ raising visits . As a peer , a friend of Churchill 's and with direct connections to the Air Staff , Trenchard championed the cause of the Air Force in the Lords , in the Press and with the Government , submitting several secret essays concerning the importance he attached to air power . 
 Trenchard also continued to exert considerable influence over the Royal Air Force . Acting with Sir John Salmond he quietly but successfully lobbied for the removal of Newall as Chief of the Air Staff and Dowding as the Command @-@ in @-@ Chief of Fighter Command . In the Autumn , Newall was replaced by Portal and Dowding was succeeded by Douglas . Both the new commanders were Trenchard protégés . 
 During the war , the Trenchard family suffered tragedy . Trenchard 's elder stepson John was killed in action in Italy and his younger stepson Edward was killed in a flying accident . His own first @-@ born son , also called Hugh , was killed in North Africa . However , Trenchard 's younger son Thomas did survive the war and frequently visited his parents when he was able . 
 = = Later years = = 
 In the aftermath of the war , several American generals , including Henry H. Arnold and Carl Andrew Spaatz , asked Trenchard to brief them in connection with the debate which surrounded the proposed establishment of the independent United States Air Force . The American air leaders held Trenchard in high esteem and dubbed him the " patron saint of air power " . The USAF was formed as an independent branch of the American Armed Forces in 1947 . 
 After World War II , Trenchard continued to set out his ideas about air power . He also supported the creation of two memorials . For the first , the Battle of Britain Chapel in Westminster Abbey , Trenchard headed a committee with Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding to raise funds for the furnishing of the chapel and for the provision of a stained glass window . The second , the Anglo @-@ American Memorial to the airmen of both nations , was erected in St Paul 's Cathedral , after Trenchard 's death . In the late 1940s and early 1950s Trenchard continued his involvement with the United Africa Company , holding the chairmanship until 1953 when he resigned . From 1954 , during the last two years of his life , Trenchard was partially blind and physically frail . 
 Trenchard died one week after his 83rd birthday at his London home in Sloane Avenue on 10 February 1956 . Following his funeral at Westminster Abbey on 21 February , his ashes were buried in the Battle of Britain Chapel he helped to create . Trenchard 's viscountcy passed to his son Thomas . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Several institutions and buildings are named after Trenchard , including the University of Ibadan 's Trenchard Hall , and RAF Cranwell 's Trenchard Hall . Also named after Trenchard are : Trenchard Lines – one of the two sites of British Army Headquarters Land Forces , the small museum at RAF Halton , one of the five houses at Welbeck College which are named after prominent military figures , and Trenchard House , which is currently used by Farnborough Air Sciences Trust to store part of their collection . In 1977 Trenchard was invested in the International Aerospace Hall of Fame at the San Diego Aerospace Museum . 
 Trenchard 's work in establishing the RAF and preserving its independence have led to him being described as the Father of the Royal Air Force . For his own part , Trenchard disliked the description , believing that General Sir David Henderson deserved the accolade . His obituary in The Times considered that Trenchard 's greatest gift to the RAF was the belief that mastery of the air must be gained and retained through offensive action . During his life , Trenchard strongly argued that the bomber was the key weapon of an air force and he is recognized today as one of the early advocates of strategic bombing and one of the architects of the British policy on imperial policing through air control .

 = Walter Bache = 
 Walter Bache ( / <unk> / ; 19 June 1842 – 26 March 1888 ) was an English pianist and conductor noted for his championing the music of Franz Liszt and other music of the New German School in England . He studied privately with Liszt in Italy from 1863 to 1865 , one of the few students allowed to do so , and continued to attend Liszt 's master classes in Weimar , Germany regularly until 1885 , even after embarking on a solo career . This period of study was unparalleled by any other student of Liszt and led to a particularly close bond between Bache and Liszt . After initial hesitation on the part of English music critics because he was a Liszt pupil , Bache was publicly embraced for his keyboard prowess , even as parts of his repertoire were questioned . 
 Bache 's major accomplishment was the establishment of Liszt 's music in England , to which he selflessly devoted himself between 1865 and his death in 1888 . This was at the height of the War of the Romantics , when conservative and liberal musical factions openly argued about the future of classical music and the merits of the compositions written in their respective schools . Bache featured several of the orchestral and choral works through an annual series of concerts , which he single @-@ handedly funded , organised and promoted . Likewise , he played an annual series of solo recitals that incorporated Liszt 's piano music . 
 Bache 's strategy for presenting these works was one of familiarity . He performed two @-@ piano arrangements of Liszt 's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions , and performed some of Liszt 's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace . He also provided informative , scholarly program notes , written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle . The English musical press , while generally hostile to the music he presented , noted and appreciated Bache 's efforts . Liszt remained grateful ; without Bache , he acknowledged , his music might not have gained the foothold that it did . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Bache was born in Birmingham , the second @-@ oldest son of well @-@ known Unitarian minister Samuel Bache , who ran a private school in conjunction with his wife , Emily Higginson . His older brother , Francis Edward Bache , was a composer and organist , while his sister , Constance Bache , was a composer , pianist and teacher who would write a joint biography of both brothers under the title Brother Musicians . He received some rudimentary musical education at his father 's school , but remained a carefree , undistinguished and <unk> child until he followed in Edward 's footsteps . Like Edward , he studied with Birmingham City Organist James Stimpson and in August 1858 , aged 16 , he travelled to Germany to attend the Leipzig Conservatory . His father was supposed to accompany him to the university , but was detained at the bedside of Edward , who was dying of consumption . Undeterred , he made the journey on his own , an early indication of his independence . 
 In Leipzig , Bache studied piano with Ignaz Moscheles and composition with Carl Reinecke . He also became friends with a fellow student , Arthur Sullivan , who , he wrote , " cannot play well , but ... has written some things which I think show great talent . " Another fellow student Bache knew well , though they were not especially close , was Edvard Grieg . While the city was reportedly past the halcyon days it had experienced under Mendelssohn , it proved valuable for exposing Bache to artists such as Pauline Viardot , Giulia Grisi , Joseph Joachim and Henri Vieuxtemps , and to the music of Beethoven , Bellini , Chopin , Moritz Hauptmann and Mendelssohn . He applied himself to his piano studies , but by his own admission wasted much time in Leipzig and lacked direction . In Brother Musicians , Constance quotes " a musician of high standing " who was one of his circle of friends ( possibly Sullivan or the pianist Franklin Taylor ) , who explained , " You see in Leipzig nobody was compelled to work , there being no particular supervision ; and there was always plenty to do , in the way of amusement , for the less energetic . As far as my recollection goes Bache was at that time rather given to working by fits and starts , frequently making excellent resolutions , the effect of which did not last many days . " 
 Upon completing his piano studies in December 1861 , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Bache travelled to Italy , staying in Milan and Florence with the intent of soaking in Italian culture before returning to England . In Florence he met Jessie Laussot , " who had founded of a flourishing musical society in the city ... and was intimately acquainted with Liszt , Wagner , Hans von Bülow and other leading musicians . " While Laussot remained kindly disposed towards Bache , she also quickly summed up his overly easy @-@ going character and decided to help him . She encouraged him to teach harmony as well as piano , then arranged a harmony class that met early in the morning some ways out of town so that he would not <unk> . She eased his way into polite society and also suggested , after hearing him play at several local concerts , that he travel to Rome and seek out Liszt . However , she insisted that he do so without any introduction from her , as she wanted Liszt to judge him solely on his own merits . 
 = = = Studies with Liszt = = = 
 Bache arrived in Rome in June 1862 . After some initial confusion ( Liszt mistook Bache , who was nervous and tongue @-@ tied , for someone wanting to borrow money ) Liszt made Bache welcome . Two or three impromptu lessons followed , along with some chamber music appearances , thanks to Liszt 's recommendation . Eventually , Liszt suggested that , if Bache were willing to move to Rome the following year , he would take him on as a regular student . Considering this " the greatest possible advantage I could have " , Bache wrote to Constance , 
 I hope I have not exaggerated in talking about Liszt ; he won 't make me anything wonderful , so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire — not at all , so don 't expect it ; but — his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else 's ; if I can spend some time with him and go through a good deal of music with him , I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas ; ... The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn . 
 After a visit to Birmingham , Bache moved to Rome in 1863 and lived there the next two years . While there he received private lessons from Liszt , one of the few pupils thus privileged ; most of Liszt 's students attended only his master classes . He also heard Liszt play his own music on many occasions in private homes , including a then @-@ rare performance of the Piano Sonata in B minor . Liszt helped him prepare for several public concerts in Rome and encouraged him to learn some difficult pieces that Bache initially felt unable to play ; these pieces included Liszt 's transcriptions of Gounod 's Faust Waltz and Meyerbeer 's " <unk> " Waltz from his opera Le prophète . These lessons , the kindness that Liszt continually showed , and Bache 's exposure to Liszt in general , became a life @-@ defining experience . Liszt expected him to work hard and Bache applied himself with a purpose to his keyboard studies . The same " musician of high standing " that Constance quotes about Bache 's years in Leipzig also states that " there can be no doubt that it was his friendship with Liszt that he owed that enthusiasm and power of sustained hard work which distinguished him during his career in London , and which was often the astonishment of those who had known him in earlier years . " 
 Bache supported himself as an organist at the English Church , where the chaplain had previously known Bache 's brother Edward . As his reputation as a performer grew , he also came into demand as a teacher . These two activities guaranteed financial security . He also became acquainted with several young gifted musicians , including fellow Liszt pupil Giovanni <unk> and violinist Ettore Pinelli . During this time , Bache began exploring the two @-@ piano repertoire , especially the arrangements of Liszt 's symphonic poem Les préludes and Schubert 's Wanderer Fantasy , which he performed with <unk> in concert . The two @-@ piano arrangements of Liszt 's symphonic poems would become an important feature of Bache 's concert series once he returned to England . He was also active in chamber music — the works he performed during this time include Chopin 's cello sonata , the David @-@ Pinelli Violin Variations , Mendelssohn 's D minor piano trio , a piano trio by Anton Rubinstein and a Schumann violin sonata arranged for viola . 
 Bache 's studies with Liszt did not end when he left Italy . He attended Liszt 's master classes in Weimar , Germany regularly until 1885 . This period of study was unparalleled by any other student of Liszt and led to a particularly close bond between Bache and Liszt . He also sought out his fellow pupil Hans von Bülow for lessons in 1871 ; the two spent much time together , which resulted in a lifelong friendship . The fact Bache valued Bülow 's advice highly is shown by his warning to Jessie Laussot to " never again attempt to ' mark , learn and inwardly digest ' the [ Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue ] without getting Bülow 's edition of it ... it is splendid — quite equivalent to having had a lesson on it from Liszt " . 
 For Bache , Liszt wrote his concert arrangement of the Sarabande and Chaconne from Handel 's opera Almira in 1879 . 
 = = = Promoting Liszt 's music = = = 
 Before he moved to Rome , in June 1863 , Bache returned to Birmingham to raise funds for the erection of a memorial window to his brother Edward . Among these efforts was a performance of Mendelssohn 's oratorio St. Paul , at which his organ playing was noted , and a solo piano recital which featured a few pieces by Liszt . Critics proved unreceptive to Liszt 's music and Bache was advised to program less adventurous works if he wanted his career to succeed . Matters had not improved when Bache settled in London in 1865 . The War of the Romantics between musically conservative and liberal factions was in full swing and he found himself branded as " dangerous " for having studied with Liszt . This was vividly illustrated when Bache called upon J. W. Davison , then the most powerful music critic in London . Such a call was not unwarranted : Davison had been acquainted with Edward and shared that brother 's conservative musical views . Bache related that when he called on Davison and handed in his card , the maid returned and told him , " Please , sir , Mr. Davison says that he is not at home . " 
 Dangerous or not , Bache soon began a lifelong crusade to win popularity for Liszt 's works in England . In 1865 he began a series of annual concerts in conjunction with singer Gustave Garcia . They began modestly , in Collard 's Rooms , Grosvenor Street . As they increased in popularity , they were relocated to the more spacious Beethoven Rooms in Cavendish Square , then to the Queen 's Concert Rooms in Hanover Square , and finally to St. James 's Hall in Regents Square . At first these concerts were of instrumental and chamber works and piano arrangements . In 1868 , they had grown to include choral works , which allowed pieces such as Liszt 's <unk> and choruses from Wagner 's Tannhäuser and Lohengrin to be programmed . By 1871 , the concerts had been changed to an orchestral format . 
 The concerts , which were held in February or March and continued until 1886 , became known as the " Walter Bache Annual Concerts . " They became fixtures on the London music scene , attracting the attention of the press and of eminent musicians . While some of the press coverage he received was positive , overall Bache faced a continual barrage of opposition and scorn from critics and fellow musicians over the music he presented . The notice printed in the Athenaeum after the first concert was typical : " On Tuesday , M. Gustave Garcia , one of the best of rising baritones , and Mr. Walter Bache gave a concert in company . We cannot think ' Les Préludes , ' a very difficult <unk> [ sic ] by the Abbé Liszt for two <unk> , worth the labour bestowed on it by a couple of players so skilled as himself and Mr. Dannreuther . It was well received however . " Largely through Bache 's perseverance , at least some of the public was gradually convinced of the music 's worth . 
 At these concerts , Bache frequently appeared as soloist , accompanist or conductor , but he also engaged other artists in an attempt to show he was not giving the concerts out of self @-@ aggrandizement . Bülow conducted two concerts , Edward Dannreuther led the orchestra in two concerts . August <unk> , the conductor of a series of orchestral concerts held at the Crystal Palace and an admirer of Liszt 's works , led four concerts . The majority of instrumentalists engaged were also members of the Crystal Palace orchestra to ensure the level of performance was as high as possible . Among guest soloists was the noted violinist August <unk> , who played the Bach Chaconne in D minor at one concert . 
 For these concerts , Bache programmed five of Liszt 's symphonic poems , the Faust and Dante symphonies , the Thirteenth Psalm and the Legend of St. Elisabeth . Works of Berlioz , Schumann and Wagner were also featured , but Liszt 's compositions predominated . While the performances of the Faust and Dante symphonies were British premieres , the symphonic poems had previously been introduced at the Crystal Palace ; nevertheless , Bache felt that offering repeat performances of the symphonic poems was important in making them familiar to audiences . Les préludes was performed three times at the Bache concerts , Mazeppa , <unk> and Orpheus each twice and Tasso once . Part of this strategy of familiarity was the inclusion of the two @-@ piano arrangements of the symphonic poems as a way to prepare audiences for the orchestral versions . Bache had begun this practice with his first concert in 1865 , when he and Dannreuther presented the two @-@ piano arrangement of Les préludes . Another part of this strategy was supplying learned , well @-@ considered and thoroughly detailed essays for program notes . Sometimes Bache wrote them himself ; at other times , he relied on prominent theorists such as Carl <unk> and Frederick Niecks . According to musicologist Alan Walker , they " are filled with insights that were both new and original for their time , and they are lavishly illustrated with music examples — a sure sign that they were aimed at a sophisticated public and were intended to have a potential life after the concert was over . " According to Walker , they still are worth study for Liszt scholars as many of the ideas , while transmitted through members of Liszt 's inner circle , probably originated with the composer himself . These notes , along with the inclusion of the two @-@ piano arrangements and what musicologist Michael Allis calls " a thoughtful approach to programming ... all contributed to an aggressive marketing of Liszt 's new status as a composer " . 
 The concerts were a considerable financial outlay for Bache , who did not have a regular salary until 1881 and had to sustain himself through teaching . By 1873 , he wrote , he had to " decide whether I shall sacrifice myself entirely to the production of Liszt 's orchestral and choral works ( which after all can never be immortal as Bach , Beethoven and Wagner : here I feel that Bülow is right ) . Or shall I make my own improvement the object of my life , and not spend a third of my income in one evening . " Bülow became concerned enough about the situation to waive his fee after one concert he conducted , and to contribute £ 50 out of his own pocket . Liszt was also concerned , writing , " For years [ Bache ] has sacrificed money for the performance of my works in London . Several times I advised him against it , but he answered <unk> , ' That is my business . ' " Whenever Bache was asked about finances for the concerts , he would tell whoever was asking that the cost was " a just recompense " and add that even if Liszt had charged him for his lessons at the same rate as the average village piano teacher , he would still be deeply in his debt . 
 In addition to the orchestral concerts , Bache gave an annual series of solo recitals on Liszt 's birthday , 22 October , between 1872 and 1887 . In October 1879 , Bache gave his first all @-@ Liszt recital . At some of these recitals , the two @-@ piano arrangements of Liszt 's orchestral works were given . The two @-@ piano version of Mazeppa was presented in October 1876 , two months before the orchestral version was played at the Crystal Palace and four months before Bache presented it at his own orchestral concert . The Monthly Musical Record felt " There was ... good reason in introducing [ it ] as a duet , with a view to familiarizing hearers with it beforehand " , and the Musical Standard found that presenting the two @-@ piano arrangement was " an immense help to those who wished to form a correct judgment on it at its first orchestral performance ... as it is impossible , with even the best intentions , to estimate correctly the larger works of Liszt after only one hearing . " 
 Liszt remained grateful to Bache and thanked him on several occasions , writing to him , " Without Walter Bache and his long years of self @-@ sacrificing efforts in the propaganda of my works , my visit to London were indeed not to be thought of . " 
 = = = Liszt 75th birthday celebrations = = = 
 Bache had long cherished the wish of bringing Liszt to London , which Liszt had last visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso , and Liszt knew that whatever standing his music had in that city had in large part to do with Bache 's efforts . At least in part to repay the debt he felt he owed Bache , Liszt accepted Bache 's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt 's 75th birthday . These celebrations included the foundation of a Liszt piano scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music , a performance of his oratorio The Legend of Saint Elizabeth led by Alexander Mackenzie in St. James 's Hall , an audience with Queen Victoria and a public reception in Liszt 's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery . Bache was involved in all four of these events , which were highly successful ; by popular demand , Saint Elizabeth had to be repeated at the Crystal Palace . 
 = = = The Working Men 's Society = = = 
 In the summer of 1867 , Bache and Dannreuther formed " The Working Men 's Society , " a small association to promote the music of Wagner , Liszt and Schumann in England , with Karl Klindworth as an elder statesman for the group . The Society met regularly at one another 's homes for the study and discussion of this music . The first study session met in December and consisted of the " Spinning Song " from Wagner 's opera The Flying Dutchman , played by Dannreuther in Liszt 's piano transcription . At the meeting the next month , the group tackled the first two scenes of Das Rheingold . The meeting which followed featured a reading of Die Walküre . Neither of the latter two works had been presented anywhere ; their world premieres at the Munich Court Opera were still two years away . Klindworth 's special relationship with Wagner ensured that the group had access to the scores . In the July 1869 meeting , Liszt pupil Anna <unk> played Liszt 's First Piano Concerto for the group . Wagner and Liszt were not the only composers discussed — Bach , Beethoven , Chopin , Henselt , Raff and Schumann were among the others whose music was featured . However , the main focus of the group remained the music of Wagner .

 Bache became a professor of piano at the Royal Academy of Music in 1881 . The foundation of the Liszt Scholarship at that institution in 1886 was mainly due to his efforts . After Bache 's death , the name of the scholarship was changed to the Liszt @-@ Bache Scholarship . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Bache died in London in 1888 , at the age of 45 , after a brief illness . He developed a chill and an ulcerated throat , which " proved too much for his over @-@ worked and highly strung nature . " He had otherwise been in good health and had taught his piano students just a couple of days before his death .

 From his early concerts , Bache was noted for showing thoughtfulness in his interpretations and an excellent pianistic technique . He was especially noted for the evenness and crispness of his scales and the " great delicacy and refinement of feeling " in his playing . Like Hans von Bülow , he was considered an " intellectual " pianist who gave performances that were well executed . He was also considered to have improved with time , becoming a less mercurial and " fidgety " player and that despite occasional exaggerations in his interpretations , his artistry was beyond question . 
 While he was not the only pianist in England to play Liszt 's works , Bache was significant in that he played works in concert for solo piano , two pianos and piano and orchestra . In addition to the two @-@ piano arrangements of the symphonic poems , the first two piano concertos , the B minor piano sonata and the Dante Sonata , Bache played a handful of transcriptions , five of the Hungarian Rhapsodies and a number of smaller @-@ scaled virtuosic works and miniatures which often highlighted " the melodic nature of Liszt 's writing " . Bache also played a number of works by other composers in his recitals , many of which are unfamiliar today . Grateful for Bülow 's assistance in conducting two of his annual concerts , Bache programmed several of the conductor 's piano works in his recitals . He also played various works by Mackenzie , Mendelssohn , Mozart , Raff , Silas , Tchaikovsky and Volkmann and more familiar pieces by Bach , Beethoven and Chopin . 
 Like Bülow , Bache performed works from memory instead of from the printed page , at a time when doing so was a matter of open debate . Also like Bülow , he began giving recitals devoted entirely to the work of one composer . In 1879 , he began giving all @-@ Liszt recitals , and in 1883 he experimented with an all @-@ Beethoven recital . 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 Bache was considered authoritative in the music of Liszt . About his performance of the B minor piano sonata , the Musical Standard wrote that Bache had made the work his own , giving the impression that Liszt 's interpretation of the piece and Bache 's were essentially one . However , while Bache 's performances were universally acclaimed , the works he chose to play received a mixed reception . The Musical Standard wrote , after a performance of the First Piano Concerto in 1871 , that while Bache 's playing was excellent , it did nothing to make Liszt 's " bizarre " concerto interesting . The Athenaeum wrote about the same performance that while the concerto was intricate , there was no difficulty in following the work as played by Bache . 
 Bache received praise for the works of other composers , as well . The Musical Standard wrote that he sounded at home with whatever the musical style of the pieces he played . The Musical World noted that Bache 's playing of Chopin , Raff , Schumann and Weber all showed " true artistic spirit and taste " . Bache 's playing of Bach was singled out for mention , with the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue " neat and highly finished " . Bache was also said to have given a " masterly " performance of the Bach D minor keyboard concerto . 
 Despite receiving positive reviews for his pianism , Bache 's difficulties with the critics on behalf of Liszt 's music had a negative backlash on his performing career . He was never invited to play with the Philharmonic Society , even after Liszt personally recommended him as a soloist . After printed inquiries by the Musical Standard , which openly questioned why Bache 's career had not advanced despite his obvious talent , he was invited in 1874 to play at the Crystal Palace . While his playing was lauded , his choice of music ( the Liszt arrangement of Weber 's Polonaise Brillante for piano and orchestra ) was derided as astoundingly impudent . He also appeared at concerts led by Hans Richter , as organist in Liszt 's symphonic poem Die <unk> and as pianist in Beethoven 's Choral Fantasy and Chopin 's Second Piano Concerto . 
 = 1928 Okeechobee hurricane = 
 The Okeechobee hurricane , also known as San Felipe Segundo hurricane , was one of the deadliest tropical cyclones in the history of Puerto Rico . The fourth tropical cyclone , third hurricane , and only major hurricane of the 1928 season , this system developed just offshore the west coast of Africa on September 6 . Initially a tropical depression , it strengthened into a tropical storm later that day , shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands . Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September 7 . About 48 hours later , the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category 1 hurricane on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Still moving westward , the system reached Category 4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September 12 . There , the storm brought " great destruction " and 1 @,@ 200 deaths . The islands of Martinique , Montserrat , and Nevis also reported damage and fatalities , but not nearly as severe as in Guadeloupe . 
 Around midday on September 13 , the storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane and peaked with sustained winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) . About six hours later , the system made landfall in Puerto Rico ; it was the only recorded tropical cyclone to strike the island at Category 5 intensity . Very strong winds resulted in severe damage in Puerto Rico . Throughout the island , an estimated 24 @,@ 728 homes were destroyed and 192 @,@ 444 were damaged , leaving over 500 @,@ 000 people homeless . Heavy rainfall also led to extreme damage to vegetation and agriculture . On Puerto Rico alone , there were 312 deaths and about $ 50 million ( 1928 USD ) in damage . While crossing the island and emerging into the Atlantic , the storm weakened slightly , falling to Category 4 intensity . The storm began crossing through the Bahamas on September 16 . Due to preparations , minimal damage or loss of life occurred , with 18 fatalities reported . 
 Early on September 17 , the storm made landfall near West Palm Beach , Florida with winds of 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) . In the city , more than 1 @,@ 711 homes were destroyed . Elsewhere in the county , impact was severest around Lake Okeechobee . The storm surge caused water to pour out of the southern edge of the lake , flooding hundreds of square miles as high as 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) above ground . Numerous houses and buildings were swept away in the cities of Belle Glade , Canal Point , Chosen , Pahokee , and South Bay . At least 2 @,@ 500 people drowned , while damage was estimated at $ 25 million . While crossing Florida , the system weakened significantly , falling to Category 1 intensity late on September 17 . It curved north @-@ northeastward and briefly re @-@ emerged into the Atlantic on September 18 , but soon made another landfall near Edisto Island , South Carolina with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Early on the following day , the system weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical over North Carolina hours later . Overall , the system caused $ 100 million in damage and at least 4 @,@ 079 deaths . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On September 6 , ships reported a tropical depression developing just off the west coast of Africa near Dakar , Senegal . The next day , a ship reported winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , or tropical storm status ; on this basis , the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the system attained tropical storm status late on September 6 . However , lack of observations for several days prevented the system from being classified in real time as it moved generally westward across the Atlantic Ocean . On September 10 , the S.S. Commack first observed the storm about 900 miles ( 1450 km ) to the east of Guadeloupe , which at the time was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship 's radio . Later that day , two other ships confirmed the intensity of the storm , and the Hurricane Research Division estimated it strengthened into a hurricane at 18 : 00 UTC on September 10 . 
 As the storm neared the Lesser Antilles , it continued to intensify . Between 17 : 30 and 18 : 30 UTC on September 12 , the hurricane 's eye moved over Guadeloupe with a barometric pressure of 940 millibars ( 28 inHg ) , suggesting maximum sustained winds of 240 km / h ( 140 mph ) , or the equivalent of a Category 4 on the Saffir – Simpson scale . Continuing to the west @-@ northwest , the hurricane passed about 10 mi ( 16 km ) south of Saint Croix before approaching Puerto Rico . On September 13 , the 15 mi ( 25 km ) eye crossed Puerto Rico in eight hours from the southeast to the northwest , moving ashore near Guayama and exiting between Aguadilla and Isabela . A ship near the southern coast reported a pressure of 931 mbar ( 27 @.@ 5 inHg ) , and the cup anemometer at San Juan reported sustained winds of 160 mph ( 268 km / h ) before failing . As the wind station was 30 miles ( 50 km ) north of the storm 's center , winds near the landfall point were unofficially estimated as high as 200 mph ( 320 km / h ) . On this basis , the hurricane made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale , although there was uncertainty in the peak intensity , due to the large size and slow movement . 
 After emerging from Puerto Rico , the hurricane had weakened to winds of about 140 mph ( 240 km / h ) , based on a pressure reading of 941 mbar ( 27 @.@ 8 inHg ) at Isabela . The storm brushed the northern coast of Hispaniola while moving west @-@ northwestward , gradually restrengthening . On September 15 , it passed within 35 mi ( 55 km ) of Grand Turk , by which time the winds increased to 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) . The storm continued through the Bahamas as a strong Category 4 hurricane , passing near Nassau at 10 : 00 UTC on September 16 . Initially , Richard Gray of the U.S. Weather Bureau was optimistic that the storm would spare the south Florida region . However , at 00 : 00 UTC on September 17 the large hurricane made landfall in southeastern Florida near West Palm Beach with estimated winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) . This was based on a pressure reading of 929 mbar ( 27 @.@ 4 inHg ) in the city , which at the time was the lowest pressure reading in the United States ; this broke the previous record of 935 mbar ( 27 @.@ 6 inHg ) set during the 1926 Miami hurricane . Peak gusts were estimated near 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) at Canal Point . 
 The hurricane quickly weakened as it progressed inland and moved over Lake Okeechobee , although the large size allowed it to maintain hurricane status for several more days . Late on September 17 , the hurricane recurved to the northeast and passed near Jacksonville early the next day with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . At 08 : 00 UTC on September 18 , the storm once again reached open waters . Later that day , the hurricane restrengthened slightly over open waters , making a second United States landfall near Edisto Island , South Carolina at 19 : 00 UTC with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Accelerating northeastward , the system quickly weakened into a tropical storm over North Carolina . On September 19 , the storm evolved into an extratropical cyclone , although it restrengthened slightly to hurricane status . The cyclone turned to the north @-@ northwest , moving quickly through the eastern United States . On September 21 , the former hurricane dissipated over Ontario , having merged with another disturbance .

 = = = Leeward Islands = = = 
 The hurricane moved directly over the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean Sea , strengthening as it did so . On the island of Dominica winds were clocked at 24 mph ( 39 km / h ) ; there were no reports of damage . In Martinique , even further south of the storm 's path , there were three fatalities . Guadeloupe received a direct hit from the storm , apparently with little warning ; the death toll there was 1 @,@ 200 , and damage reports relayed through Paris indicated " great destruction " on the island . Approximately 85 % – 95 % of banana crops were destroyed , 70 % – 80 % of tree crops suffered severe damage , and 40 % of the sugar cane crop was ruined . 
 Montserrat , just north of the storm 's center , was warned in advance of the storm but still suffered £ 150 @,@ 000 ( 1928 <unk> ) in damages and 42 deaths ; Plymouth and Salem were devastated and crop losses caused near @-@ starvation conditions before relief could arrive . The storm passed to the south of the islands of St. Kitts and St. Croix , which suffered heavy damage to property and crops but no reported fatalities . Nevis also reported three deaths due to the storm . 
 = = = Puerto Rico = = = 
 While the storm was passing near Dominica , the San Juan , Puerto Rico Weather Bureau warned about the threat of the hurricane which would strike the island within a day or two . The advisory was sent via telegraph to 75 police districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours ; this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio . Warnings were also posted for 12 ports along the southern coast , causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port . Effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312 , and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of Puerto Rico . By comparison , the weaker 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane killed approximately 3 @,@ 000 people . 
 According to the San Juan National Weather Service office , the storm was " up to this time the greatest and more [ sic ] intense and destructive hurricane of record in Puerto Rico . " Along the storm path , the eye passed over Guayama , Cayey , and Aibonito , resulting in a period of calm lasting 20 minutes . The island of Puerto Rico received the worst of the storm 's winds when the hurricane moved directly across the island at Category 5 strength . The hurricane was extremely large as it crossed Puerto Rico . Hurricane @-@ force winds were measured in Guayama for 18 hours ; since the storm is estimated to have been moving at 13 mph ( 21 km / h ) , the diameter of the storm 's hurricane winds was estimated very roughly to be 234 miles ( 376 km ) . 
 The storm was named the San Felipe II Hurricane because the eye of the cyclone made landfall on the Christian feast day of Saint Philip . It was named " Segundo " , Spanish for " the Second " , because of another destructive " San Felipe hurricane " which struck Puerto Rico on that same day in 1876 . Since European arrival in the Americas in 1492 all storms and hurricanes were named after the name of the saint of the day the storm hit Puerto Rico . In 1953 the United States started naming hurricanes by female names until 1978 when both gender names began to be used . Yet it was only in 1960 that hurricanes stopped being officially named after saints . 
 The rainfall recorded on September 13 – 14 , 1928 , remains the record for the maximum rainfall associated with a hurricane in Puerto Rico within a period of forty @-@ eight hours . In those regions where precipitation is more common place , as in Adjuntas in the Cordillera Central and in the Sierra de Luquillo , the rain was over 25 inches ( 640 mm ) , with 29 @.@ 60 inches ( 752 mm ) recorded in Adjuntas . The anemometer located in Puerta de Tierra lost one of its cups at 11 : 44 am on September 13 , just when it had registered a maximum speed of 150 miles ( 240 km ) per hour — a speed that was sustained for five consecutive minutes . Previously the same instrument had measured 160 miles ( 260 km ) per hour for one minute . Because these measurements were taken 30 miles ( 48 km ) from San Felipe 's eye , at the time , it seemed possible that some estimates of 200 miles ( 320 km ) per hour near the center of the storm were not overdrawn . 
 There was general destruction through the island , with the towns where the eye passed being swept away . Property damage on the island from winds and rain was catastrophic . The northeast portion of the island received winds in excess of Category 3 strength , with hurricane @-@ force winds lasting as long as 18 hours . Official reports stated " several hundred thousand " people were left homeless , and property damages were estimated at $ 50 million . 
 On the island there was no building that was not affected . Some sugar mills ( " Centrales " ) that had cost millions of dollars to build were reduced to rubble . Reports say that 24 @,@ 728 homes were destroyed and 192 @,@ 444 were partially destroyed . Most of the sugarcane fields were flooded , ruining the year 's crops . Half of the coffee plants and half of the shade trees that covered these were destroyed ; almost all of the coffee harvest was lost . The coffee industry would take years to recover since coffee needs shade trees to grow . The tobacco farms also had great losses . After this hurricane , Puerto Rico never regained its position as a major coffee exporter . 
 Communications were impacted by fallen trees , landslides , and damaged bridges . Of the school buildings 770 were destroyed or damaged . According to some estimates of the day , excluding personal losses , the damages reached $ 85 @.@ 312 million and over 500 @,@ 000 people were left homeless . San Felipe II is officially classified as Puerto Rico 's biggest , worst , and most devastating hurricane to ever have impacted the island . 
 = = = Greater Antilles and Bahamas = = = 
 After affecting Puerto Rico , the hurricane passed just north of the Dominican Republic , producing very little damage . This was due to the small core and weaker winds to the south of the center . Advance warning reduced the number of ships traversing the region . 
 While the hurricane was passing nearby , Grand Turk reported winds of 120 mph ( 193 km / h ) . According to a ship report in the region , " The force of the wind ... could only be judged by the noise made by the storm , which reminded me of the New York subway going full speed passing switches . " Winds approached 120 mph ( 193 km / h ) at Nassau before the anemometer failed . In addition to the winds , the storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region , totaling 9 in ( 228 mm ) in Nassau . As in Puerto Rico , authorities in the Bahamas had ample warning of the hurricane 's approach , and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands . Two boats were wrecked as they washed ashore in Grand Turk , although the crews were saved . A sloop traversing from Ambergris Caye to Grand Turk was lost , killing all 18 people on board . The storm caused heavy damage throughout the Bahamas , mostly to property and crops . 
 In Nassau , some buildings which were recently repaired after the 1926 Nassau hurricane were destroyed during this storm . A 10 @-@ year @-@ old girl drowned after falling into an open trench filled with water . At the Fort Montague Hotel , the windows , doors , and furniture were badly damaged . Similar impact was reported at the Royal Victoria Hotel , while the British Colonial Hotel was largely spared . However , the gardens of the three hotels were " damaged almost beyond recognition " . 
 On Bimini , sustained winds of 140 mph ( 230 km / h ) were observed , causing major damage to buildings . Ninety @-@ five houses and some other buildings , including a few churches and government buildings , were damaged or destroyed on Eleuthera . Minor damage was reported on Rum Cay . Most of the food crops were destroyed . On San Salvador Island , four buildings were demolished , including two churches , while several other structures suffered minor damage . Food crops were nearly wiped out .

 While the hurricane was moving through the Bahamas , the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Miami to Titusville , later upgrading to a hurricane warning from Miami to Daytona Beach . The agency advised residents to take precautions for the hurricane , citing the potential for strong winds and waves . Hurricane warnings were also posted for the west coast from Punta Rassa to Apalachicola , and after the storm recurved , hurricane warnings were extended along the east coast to Jacksonville . Because of well @-@ issued hurricane warnings , residents were prepared for the storm , and the number of lives lost in the coastal Palm Beach area was only 26 . 
 Strong winds struck southern Florida as the hurricane moved ashore , with three unofficial reports of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . In Miami to the south of the center , winds reached 78 mph ( 126 km / h ) , and farther south , Key West reported winds of only 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) . The eye at landfall was 25 miles ( 40 km ) wide , and after moving inland crossed Lake Okeechobee , where a calm was reported for 30 minutes . Winds at Canal Point , adjacent to the lake , were estimated as high as 160 mph ( 255 km / h ) ; the anemometer blew away after reporting sustained winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . The pressure at Canal Point dropped to 942 mbar ( 27 @.@ 82 inHg ) . The lowest pressure north of Lake Okeechobee was 966 mbar ( 28 @.@ 54 inHg ) in Bartow , and along the west coast , winds reached 31 mph ( 50 km / h ) in Tampa . 
 The hurricane left thousands of people homeless in Florida ; property damage was estimated at $ 25 million ( $ 345 million ) . It is estimated if a similar storm were to strike as of the year 2003 , it would cause $ 18 @.@ 7 billion in damages . The cyclone remains one of three Atlantic hurricanes to strike the southern mainland of Florida with a central pressure below 940 mbar ( 27 @.@ 76 inHg ) , the others being the 1926 Miami hurricane and Hurricane Andrew of 1992 . 
 In addition to the human fatalities , 1 @,@ 278 livestock and 47 @,@ 389 poultry were killed , respectively . Agriculture was impacted significantly , with the storm destroying what may have been the largest " citrus crop in the history of the industry " . Approximately 6 % of oranges and 18 % of grapefruit were ruined , respectively . Harvesting the remaining crops was delayed until mid @-@ October due to inundated groves . Communications also suffered severely . Throughout the state , 32 @,@ 000 households were left without telephone service and 400 poles were broken and about 2 @,@ 500 others leaning . Then @-@ Governor of Florida John W. Martin estimated that 35 @,@ 000 families were left homeless in Palm Beach County alone . Additionally , about 11 @,@ 500 families would need to be " re @-@ established " .

 In Miami , damage was minimal , limited to broken windows and awnings . In Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale , windows and roofs were damaged , although damage was still fairly minor . Numerous power lines and telephone wires were downed in the latter . Northward , from Pompano Beach to Jupiter , buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and 10 ft ( 3 m ) storm surge . Nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in Deerfield Beach , while several citizens estimated that at least 50 % of homes were demolished . The town 's post office , depot , and an entire business block were also destroyed . An eight @-@ year @-@ old boy drowned in a ditch near where his family sought refuge . In Boca Raton , two garages and several houses were destroyed . At the Cloister Inn , windows were shattered and the roof was damaged ; across the street , 32 freight cars belonging to a train along the Florida East Coast Railway were tossed by the wind into a nearby ditch . A short distance to the north , a warehouse was flattened . A building occupied by a restaurant and a store was flattened . In Delray Beach , four churches suffered severe damage and the Alta Repp and Seacrest hotels both lost a portion of their roof . The police reported three deaths within the city . In Delray Beach and Lantana , all houses and the railroad station were badly damaged . In Boynton Beach , about 75 % of businesses suffered complete destruction . Fifteen people were injured by a roof collapse while taking refuge in the auditorium of a high school . 
 In Lake Worth , approximately 50 % of homes were damaged or destroyed , while 75 % of buildings in the business district suffered damage . Impact along the coast was most severe in Palm Beach . Total coastal damages were estimated as " several million " dollars . In West Palm Beach , the storm destroyed 1 @,@ 711 homes and damaged 6 @,@ 369 others , and demolished 268 businesses and impacted 490 other businesses ; the city suffered the worst damage , totaling just under $ 13 @.@ 8 million . Likewise , there was also severe wind damage in Palm Beach . A few buildings constructed by Henry Flagler , such as The Breakers , the Royal <unk> Hotel , and Whitehall , were damaged . Mar @-@ a @-@ Lago suffered little impact other than uprooted trees and the destruction of a large Roman @-@ style window , according to Marjorie Merriweather Post . Rodman Wanamaker 's house , known as " La <unk> " and later the " Winter White House " during the presidency of John F. Kennedy , suffered heavy damage during the storm . The Alba , <unk> , New Palm Beach , and Royal <unk> hotels all suffered water damage , while the Alba Hotel was also deroofed . Nearby , the Rainbow Pier only received structural damage to its railings , though the pier office was blown away . Approximately 600 structures , including 10 hotels , were damaged in Palm Beach . Damage totaled over $ 2 million . 
 The strongest winds in the eyewall affected northern Palm Beach County , particularly the vicinity of Jupiter , as the eye made landfall farther south . At the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse , the mortar was reportedly " squeezed ... like toothpaste " between the bricks during the storm , swaying the tower 17 in ( 430 mm ) off the base . The lighthouse keeper , Captain Seabrook , and his son , Franklin , worked to keep the light on during the storm after the electricity went out . After the generator failed to work , they hand @-@ cranked the light 's mantle . The building formerly used as a Weather Bureau Office was destroyed . Nearby , six people died after a house was demolished . Six other fatalities occurred west of Jupiter after a school where people sought shelter collapsed . 
 = = = = Lake Okeechobee and Everglades = = = = 
 Inland , the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of Lake Okeechobee . Residents had been warned to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day , but after the hurricane did not arrive on schedule , many thought it had missed and returned to their homes . In the weeks prior to storm , heavy rainfall caused the lake to rise 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) between August 10 and September 10 and filled nearby canals and ditches . Precipitation from the hurricane itself caused Lake Okeechobee to rise further . When the worst of the storm crossed the lake , the south @-@ blowing wind caused a storm surge to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake . The resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over 20 ft ( 6 m ) deep . Houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered . Most survivors and bodies were washed out into the Everglades where many of the bodies were never found . Agricultural losses in the area surrounding Lake Okeechobee were also significant , with virtually all crops destroyed and over 150 tractors suffering damage . 
 As the rear eyewall passed over the area , the flood reversed itself , breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing similar but smaller flooding . Route 98 , then known as Conner 's Highway , was closed until January , when the bridge across the <unk> River at Taylor Creek was replaced after the original bridge was carried about 150 ft ( 46 m ) upstream during the storm . In Okeechobee County , homes along the lake were destroyed by the storm surge , while dwellings within the city of Okeechobee were severely impacted or demolished by winds of at least 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) . However , brick and concrete @-@ structured dwellings received little damage . A number of three @-@ story business buildings collapsed during the storm . Almost all roads were left impassable , while communications were nearly wiped out . Overall , 27 deaths occurred in Okeechobee County . Along the southwestern shore of Lake Okeechobee , the towns of Clewiston and Moore Haven were both flooded , but much of the damage to houses was due to strong winds . 
 On <unk> Island , many residents received information about the storm when it was too late to evacuate . In some homes , 20 – 30 people sought shelter inside and later stood on tables and chairs to remain above the water . Most of the homes were swept away into rows of pine trees and others more than half a mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) away . Despite this , only one person drowned on the island . Residents of Torry Island also did not have ample time to prepare for the storm . They attempted to evacuate , but the causeway was already inundated , forcing twenty @-@ three people to seek refuge in a packinghouse . Floodwaters entered the building , forcing the occupants into the rafters . However , the building was eventually pushed into a nearby canal . Ten people drowned , but thirteen others survived by clinging to a barge or tree tops , while one woman tied herself to a telegraph pole . Others that survived were swept far away from where the building once stood or the barge . A teenage boy was carried from the packinghouse to the Everglades Experiment Station in Belle Glade – a distance of about 8 mi ( 13 km ) . On <unk> Island , a number who successfully climbed to the roof of their houses were struck by trees or received fatal bites from water moccasin . 
 In South Bay , nearly all houses were destroyed and several buildings were unroofed . At least 160 fatalities occurred in the city . Throughout the 1920s , <unk> suffered several floods and muck fires . Finally , the town was flooded severely during the storm and was subsequently abandoned . Bean City was also destroyed during the hurricane , but it was eventually rebuilt by Arthur Wells . Sebring Farms was reduced to piles of rubber , with only four tall royal palm trees left standing . Only the hotel at Miami Locks survived the storm . Ninety @-@ nine people died in that town . In Chosen , only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people . Twenty other residents took refuge in a building which lost its roof during the storm , forcing the occupants to move into the restroom . A house that was full of people floated about half a mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) from its original location . The refugees were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment . 
 Floodwaters persisted for several weeks , greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation . Burial services were quickly overwhelmed , and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves . Around 75 % of the fatalities were migrant farm workers , making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult ; as a result of this , the count of the dead is not very accurate . The Red Cross estimated the number of fatalities as 1 @,@ 836 , which was taken as the official count by the National Weather Service for many years ( and exactly equal to the official count for Hurricane Katrina ) . Older sources usually list 3 @,@ 411 as the hurricane 's total count of fatalities , including the Caribbean . However , in 2003 the U.S. death count was revised to " at least " 2 @,@ 500 , making the Okeechobee hurricane the second @-@ deadliest natural disaster in United States history behind the 1900 Galveston hurricane . A mass grave at the Port Mayaca Cemetery east of Port Mayaca contains the bodies of 1 @,@ 600 victims of the hurricane .

 In Fort Myers , property damage was slight , limited mostly to scores of small boats and fishing shacks along the waterfront . Nearly all cigar factories in Tampa were closed after wind and rain drove too much moisture into the buildings . Offshore , the fishing smack Wallace A. McDonnell was beached near Piney Point , though all of the crew survived . Additionally , the Cuban schooner Isabel <unk> sank offshore Boca Grande . The crew , who were immigrants , were rescued by the Coast Guard and later deported . In Martin County , a bridge connecting Stuart and Palm City was severely damaged and closed to traffic as a result . A temporary ferry service across the St. Lucie River was established and operated until repairs to the bridge were complete in the summer of 1929 . In Fort Pierce , most of the impact was confined to the waterfront areas . A warehouse , fish houses , docks , and a bridge across the Indian River were destroyed , while several other buildings were unroofed . Damage in the city totaled about $ 150 @,@ 000 . 
 In the interior areas of Central and North Florida , impact was mainly confined to agricultural losses , particularly citrus , though wind damage occurred to structures . Between Sebring and Lake Wales , 200 telephone poles were toppled . In Bartow , business building windows were shattered and signs were knocked down , while several roofs and chimneys also suffered damage . Winds gusting up to 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) lashed Lakeland . Many trees were uprooted and several buildings were impacted , including the hospital and a number of businesses . At Florida Southern College ( FSC ) , the north side of the gymnasium collapsed while other buildings on campus were damaged to a less degree . The trees in the citrus grove surrounding FSC lost much of their fruit . Overall , Lakeland suffered about $ 50 @,@ 000 in damage . In Orlando , impact to properties was described as slight . Winds up to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) impacted the Jacksonville area , resulting in minor damage at Jacksonville Beach .

 Outside of Florida , damage in the United States was minor from the hurricane . In Georgia , low @-@ lying streets were flooded or washed out in the Savannah area . Additionally , winds downed trees and power lines . Heavy rainfall occurred from eastern Florida through coastal Georgia , the Carolinas , and southeast Virginia . The highest rainfall total was 12 @.@ 53 inches ( 318 mm ) at Darlington , South Carolina . The storm caused flooding in North Carolina and brought near @-@ hurricane @-@ force winds and a 7 foot ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) storm surge to the Norfolk area . After the hurricane became extratropical , its wind field became very large . Atlantic City , New Jersey recorded winds of 76 mph ( 122 km / h ) despite being far from the center .

 In the immediate aftermath of the storm , relief arrived from nearby areas such as Miami . Early on September 18 , a train leaving Miami carried 20 doctors and 20 nurses to West Palm Beach . The Miami Red Cross Citizens Relief Committee , which was established to provide aid for victims of the storm , transported " hundreds of loaves of bread , gallons of milk , pounds of coffee and sugar , blankets , cots , and medical supplies . " The first relief train was ridden by U.S. Senator Joseph T. Robinson , the Democratic vice presidential nominee during the election that year . At least 100 people were brought to Miami for medical treatment . In Lake Worth , 25 people were treated for various injuries at the Gulf Stream Hotel and the local fire station . Dr. W. A. Claxton , chief of the Miami Department of Public Welfare , requested antitoxin , typhoid serum , and at least 200 tetanus serums . There was also a request for 1 @,@ 000 more cots in West Palm Beach and Kelsey City .

 In Florida , although the hurricane destroyed everything in its path with impartiality , the death toll was by far highest in the economically poor areas in the low @-@ lying ground right around Lake Okeechobee , such as Belle Glade , Chosen , Pahokee , South Bay , and Bean City . Around 75 % of the fatalities were among migrant farm workers , most of whom were black . The black workers did most of the cleanup work , and the few caskets available for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites . Additionally , the white victims received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in downtown West Palm Beach , which was the only mass gravesite to receive a memorial . 
 In contrast , the bodies of black victims were burned in funeral pyres or thrown into mass burial sites such as the ones in West Palm Beach and Port Mayaca . Robert Hazard , a resident of West Palm Beach , established the Storm of ' 28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc. to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm . In 2000 , the West Palm Beach burial site was reacquired by the city of West Palm Beach and plans for construction of a memorial began . The site was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2002 and a state historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane . The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction . The effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers was dramatized in Zora Neale Hurston 's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God .

 In the aftermath of the hurricane in coastal Florida , it became apparent that well @-@ constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings . Buildings with well @-@ constructed frames , and those made of steel , concrete , brick , or stone were largely immune to winds , and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings . Coming on the heels of the 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed , one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes .

 To prevent a recurrence of disasters like this one and the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 , the Florida State Legislature created the Okeechobee Flood Control District , which was authorized to cooperate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in flood control undertakings . After a personal inspection of the area by President Herbert Hoover , the Corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels , control gates , and major levees along Lake Okeechobee 's shores . A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control , water conservation , prevention of saltwater intrusion , and preservation of fish and wildlife populations . One of the solutions was the construction of the Herbert Hoover Dike . Today , concerns related to the dike 's stability have grown in response to studies indicating long term problems with " piping " and erosion . Leaks have been reported after several heavy rain events . Proposed solutions to the dike 's problems have included the construction of a seepage berm on the landward side of the dike , with the first stage costing approximately $ 67 million ( US $ ) . 
 = Double Allergic = 
 Double Allergic is the second studio album by the Australian alternative rock band Powderfinger . Released in Australia on 2 September 1996 Polydor , the album was produced by Tim Whitten and widely considered Powderfinger 's mainstream breakthrough . 
 Four singles were released from the album : " Pick You Up " , " D.A.F. " , " Living Type " and " Take Me In " . " Pick You Up " was the most successful single from the album , and Powderfinger 's first moderate success , reaching # 23 on the ARIA charts . " D.A.F. " also charted as a moderate success ; it reached # 39 on the Australian music charts . Both " Living Type " and " Take Me In " did not chart officially , but " Living Type " was voted into the Triple J Hottest 100 in 1996 . 
 Critics were generally favorable in their reviews of Double Allergic . It was praised by Allmusic reviewer Jonathan Lewis as " a cohesive and mature effort " . It has also been certified platinum three times , with over 200 @,@ 000 copies sold . Double Allergic was also nominated for five ARIA awards , with singles from the album nominated for an additional four , however , it won none of the awards it was nominated for . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Double Allergic contained material that had been written by Powderfinger in 1995 and 1996 . Prior to its release , guitarist Darren Middleton described it as " by far the best thing we 've done " , an analogy that would be often made when comparing the album to its predecessor , Parables for Wooden Ears . Middleton praised the album because the band knew how they wanted the record to sound before they began to record ; he also described it as " the most concise continuation of who we are down on record " . 
 Lead singer Bernard Fanning noted that another important element of the album was that there " was more space in the songs , it wasn 't overcrowded " . However , Fanning commented that Powderfinger had not intended to greatly change their sound in creating Double Allergic , instead , the change in sound came as a natural <unk> the guitarist Ian Haug agreed , stating the music was " more melodic and sort of simpler " , without " so many different time signatures and things " . Rolling Stone author Tracey <unk> also commented on this , stating that " Powderfinger have become practical advocates of space " and lauding their acknowledgment that the " absence of sound can be lush , evocative " . She noted that even in the " rockers " on the album songs — like " Pick You Up " and " Skinny Jean " — the band were still able to pull back and give the songs additional space . 
 Powderfinger spent less money producing Double Allergic than on their previous works . Previously , the band had worked with Tony Cohen , whom Fanning stated was expensive due to his success in the industry . For Double Allergic the band chose Tim Whitten , a less well known producer , and because the band knew what they intended to do as they entered the studio they managed to spend less despite the improved sound . Middleton commented on Whitten 's capabilities in the recording studio , saying " He 's what a band looks for in a producer / engineer , because he 's got his own ideas " , but stating that Whitten would also listen to and appreciate the band 's ideas .

 Double Allergic was released on 2 September 1996 in Australia on the Polydor record label . It entered the ARIA chart at # 7 , and spent ten weeks in the top ten . Over 200 @,@ 000 copies were sold , and the album is currently certified 3x platinum , asserting at least 210 @,@ 000 sales . The album finished 1996 at # 44 on the ARIA end of year albums chart , and finished 1997 at # 53 . 
 " Pick You Up " , the first single , was released on 13 April 1996 , and entered the ARIA singles chart at # 34 . By its fifth week , on 30 June , it had reached its peak at # 23 - it spent a further seven weeks on the chart before dropping out . " Pick You Up " was described as having a " very professional sound " . The song appeared at # 6 on the Triple J Hottest 100 , 1996 . " D.A.F. " , the second single , was released on 5 August 1996 . It spent four weeks on the ARIA chart , peaking at # 39 . The title of the song was taken from its chord progression , in the words of the bass guitarist John Collins " because we were stupid " . The song appeared at # 18 on the Triple J Hottest 100 , 1996 . 
 " Living Type " was the third single , released on 11 November 1996 . The song peaked at # 42 on the ARIA charts and stayed in the top 50 for three weeks . " Living Type " was written by Fanning about the Manson Family cult , and came with an X @-@ Files style music video . The song appeared at # 32 on the Triple J Hottest 100 , 1996 . The fourth single , " Take Me In " , was released on 12 May 1997 . It failed to chart , and was the least noted single from the album . Fanning wrote " Take Me In " as a response to hypocrisy by police , which he had read about in newspapers . 
 The album contains three secret tracks placed onto the twelfth track after silence that follows the track 's primary song " ( The Return of ) The Electric Horseman " . The first of these is called " Vladimir " which , according to Fanning is about a transvestite . The second song is called " SS " which refers to Australian cricket bat manufacturer Stuart Surridge , which is often known by those initials . The song refers in part to the bat itself , though mostly to cricket in general , with lyrics " Then we 'll race like jets for the fading moon ; Then we all fall down " , which refers to running for the opposite crease following striking the ball , and then diving to the ground to secure the run . The third and final secret track is called " Come Away " which also appeared as a B @-@ side for the single of " Pick You Up " . In a first for the group , it had the guitarist Darren Middleton as lead vocalist , while a spoken sound sample at the end of the song is the bass guitarist John Collins ' voice .

 Double Allergic was well received by Allmusic , with reviewer Jonathan Lewis claiming that Powderfinger " managed to successfully create an album of melodic pop songs coupled with noisy guitars " . The album was summarised as " a cohesive and mature effort " . 
 Sputnikmusic reviewer <unk> , had mixed feelings about the album . The level of experimentation in the album was praised , with the reviewer stating that " the instrument playing and some of the unusual styles used " were beneficial . However , the main concern was that there wasn 't enough experimentation , and that the album was rather " solid " , thus earning it its score of 3 @.@ 5 . 
 Juice magazine reviewed Double Allergic positively , calling it a much more mature album than its predecessor , Parables for Wooden Ears . The " band 's mellowing tone " , compared to the " aggression " in past works , was also commended , with the review stating that " the result is an album filled with potential and character " . The experimentation on " JC " , " Glimpse " and " <unk> " was again praised , with comparisons to Motown drawn .

 = = Plot = = 
 A young , struggling British filmmaker Sue McKinley ( Alice Patten ) comes across the diary of her grandfather , Mr. McKinley ( Steven Mackintosh ) , who served as a jailer in the Imperial Police during the Indian independence movement . Through the diary , she learns about the story of five freedom fighters who were active in the movement : Chandrasekhar Azad , Bhagat Singh , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Khan , and Ram Prasad Bismil . McKinley , in his diary , states that he had met two type of people in his life , those who died without uttering a sound and those who died with lots of anguish , crying over their deaths . McKinley reveals that it was then that he met with the third kind - those who die with a smile on their lips . 
 Having decided to make a self @-@ financed documentary film about these revolutionaries , Sue travels to India , with the help of her friend , Sonia ( Soha Ali Khan ) , from the Institute for International Studies at the University of Delhi . After a few unsuccessful auditions in search of the actors , Sue finally casts Sonia 's friends , four young men – Daljit " DJ " Singh ( Aamir Khan ) , Karan Singhania ( Siddharth Narayan ) , Aslam Khan ( Kunal Kapoor ) and Sukhi Ram ( Sharman Joshi ) — to portray the revolutionaries . 
 Though they aren 't very enthusiastic at the idea of acting in a film about the independence movement , Sue eventually manages to convince them . Laxman Pandey ( Atul Kulkarni ) , a right @-@ wing political party activist , joins the cast later , despite initially being unpopular due to his anti @-@ Western ideology , due to which he is often at odds with the other four , and anti @-@ Muslim beliefs and contempt for Aslam Khan . In the process of filming , the idealism of India 's revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists . They gradually begin to realize that their own lives are quite similar to the characters they portray in Sue 's film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation . 
 Meanwhile , Ajay Singh Rathod ( R. Madhavan ) , a flight lieutenant in the Indian Air Force who is Sonia 's fiancé , is killed when his jet , a MiG @-@ 21 , crashes . The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation . Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot , Sonia and her friends do not accept the official explanation . Instead , they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives that would have been lost had he ejected from the aircraft and left it to crash into a populous city . They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister Shastri ( Mohan Agashe ) , who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG @-@ 21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour . To their surprise , they learn that the key person who was responsible for organizing the deal was Karan 's father , Rajnath Singhania ( Anupam Kher ) . 
 Angered by the situation , the group and their supporters decide to protest peacefully at India Gate , a war memorial in New Delhi . Police forcefully break up their protest using batons ; in the process , Rathod 's mother ( Waheeda Rehman ) is severely injured and slips into a coma . DJ , Karan , Aslam , Sukhi , and Laxman decide that they must emulate the early freedom fighters and resort to violence to achieve justice . As a result , they kill the defence minister to avenge Rathod 's death , while Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions . The minister is reported to have been killed by terrorists and is hailed as a martyr by the media . To bring forth their intentions behind the killings , the five of them attempt to reach the public through a radio station . They forcibly take over the All India Radio station premises after having evacuated its employees . Karan goes on air and reveals the truth about the defence minister and his wrongdoings . While still on the air , the police proclaim that they are dangerous terrorists who have forcefully taken over the AIR , and therefore they are to be shot on sight . The first to be shot is Daljit , who tries to get out of cover and establish that they are not terrorists . Sukhi , unable to control his anger , shows himself and is instantly shot . As they are trying to lock the terrace doors , Aslam and Pandey are then killed by a grenade and the once archenemies die holding hands and smiling , as they have visions of Ram Prasad Bismil and <unk> Khan . 
 Daljit manages to crawl to the recording room , where Karan is still on air . When Karan understands that he has been shot , they speak amongst themselves for the last time , regarding the others , about Sue and about Daljit 's love for her . They are then killed by police commandos while laughing . It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he came across as being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal , with a heartfelt laughter . After their death , the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice , following the motives of all the boys . 
 The film comes to an end with Sue describing the impact of the boys on her life . As she and Sonia watch from the rooftop that Ajay proposed to her on , they have a vision of the boys running in the fields , singing happily and victoriously throwing their shirts in the air , acting as if they are celebrating life itself , as if the ebb of their once @-@ there vitality still reverberates in the places where they once used to go , and a wave of melancholy comes over the two surviving women . 
 In an afterlife @-@ like state , the boys watch as a father tells his son ( a young Bhagat Singh ) about gardening . They watch over him with smiling faces , then depart as friends for eternity .

 Rakeysh Mehra took seven years to research and develop the story , including three to write the script . While some raised doubts about his morale following the failure of his last film , Aks , at the box office , he retorted by saying that it would not affect him at all . He added that not only did his storytelling technique improve , but past mistakes had helped him improve his filmmaking abilities . 
 Development of Rang De Basanti originated with several ideas Mehra came up with early on but later dropped or greatly evolved into new directions . One of these involved a group of youngsters who worked in an automobile repair shop , while another was about the life of Bhagat Singh , an Indian freedom revolutionary . During this time , he personally conducted a survey with a group of youths in New Delhi and Mumbai about the Indian revolutionaries he was planning on depicting , which indicated that many of youngsters did not recognize the names of some of the most prominent revolutionaries . This led Mehra to believe that the sense of " patriotism had blurred " in the young generation . Because of this , he dropped his original plans in favor of a new idea in which a British documentary filmmaker on a visit to India realizes that the local " kids are more Western than her " . This new story , which eventually formed the basis for Rang De Basanti 's script , was influenced by Mehra 's upbringing , youth and experiences over the years , including his desire to join the Indian Air Force while in school , as well as his recollections of listening to Independence Day speeches and watching patriotic films such as Mother India . Although Mehra denies that the film is autobiographical , he confessed that the character sketches were loosely inspired by himself and his friends . 
 Mehra approached <unk> Paul after having been impressed with his production work on British films Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch . Paul , who was keen to work in India , liked Mehra 's story and agreed to produce the film , bringing with him David Reid and Adam <unk> as executive producers . Despite having no prior knowledge of Hindi cinema , Reid and <unk> 's belief in the script was strong enough that they each were willing to work at half their normal rate . While it was originally suggested that language versions of the film would be made concurrently , in English ( as Paint it Yellow ) and Hindi , the plans for an English version were dropped during development . Mehra believed that English @-@ language version felt alien and that " one can tell a film in just one language " . After the English version was dropped , the writer Kamlesh Pandey was brought on board to pen the first draft of Rang De Basanti in Hindi , marking the start of his screenwriting career . Thereafter Mehra and co @-@ writer Rensil D 'Silva took over the script , working on it for about two years . Prasoon Joshi , the film 's lyricist , worked on the dialogue , marking his foray into screenwriting . 
 Rang De Basanti suffered a significant setback when one of the initial producers ultimately failed to contribute any funds towards it ; the shortfall left production looking uncertain just two months away from the beginning of principal photography . However , after Aamir Khan agreed to act in the film , Mehra approached Ronnie Screwvala of UTV Motion Pictures with the script . Screwvala , who supported Mehra from the beginning of the production , had faith in the film , reasoning that in historical films , " the treatment and execution is very different from regular masala fare " , and that such films " find favour with the audience owing to their elaborate sets and period costumes " . The budget was reported as Rs . 250 million ( approximately US $ 5 @.@ 5 million ) , and , despite going a little over the initially planned budget , Mehra did not have any serious disagreements with UTV . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Aamir Khan agreed to act in Rang De Basanti immediately after reading Mehra 's script . Mehra described his character as a simple man with a strong sense of integrity and dignity . Khan , who would turn 40 during the shoot , lost about 10 kilograms ( 22 lb ) with a strict diet and exercise regime to more convincingly depict a man in his late twenties . Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor were publicly attached to the film by the time it was officially announced ; Kapoor had been the assistant director to Mehra during the filming of Aks and was already familiar with the material Mehra had been developing . Mehra gave Kulkarni biographies of Ram Prasad Bismil as preparation , including Bismil 's autobiography . Early rumors indicated that actors Arjun Rampal and Arjan Bajwa would be amongst the male leads , but these roles ultimately were filled by Sharman Joshi , Siddharth Narayan and R. Madhavan . 
 Rang De Basanti marked Siddharth 's Bollywood debut , following on the success of his Telugu film <unk> <unk> . Having previously worked as an assistant director , Siddharth praised Mehra as being " by far the most ambitious technical filmmaker in Indian cinema " . Madhavan , despite being a well @-@ known Tamil cinema actor , took the smaller role of a fighter aircraft pilot because he was convinced of the film 's potential and wanted to be a part of it . Om Puri appears in a two @-@ scene cameo as Aslam 's staunch Muslim father . 
 Soha Ali Khan and Alice Patten immediately became Mehra 's clear favorites for each of their roles during casting , which led to Patten flying to Mumbai for a screen test with the entire cast . She was informed that she had won the documentary filmmaker role after she returned home to the United Kingdom . Soha , portraying the pilot 's fiancée , was filming Rituparna Ghosh 's <unk> and David Dhawan 's comedy Shaadi No. 1 concurrently with her work in Rang De Basanti . In particular , the demands of her emotional scenes in <unk> often left her exhausted , thus requiring " a lot of personal overhauling " to ensure that her performance in Rang De Basanti was unaffected . During filming , reports indicated that co @-@ stars Siddharth and Soha had become romantically involved with each other . Alongside the two lead actresses , <unk> Tandon played the role of Aamir 's Grand Father and Kirron Kher played the mother of Khan 's character .

 The film , which was shot in New Delhi , Mumbai , Rajasthan and Punjab , was officially launched at a hotel on 1 February 2005 . When shooting began , Mehra made an announcement to his crew saying that they would enjoy their holiday only in July . 
 Instead of filming at the actual locations from the script , other locations were selected for picturisation . One such scene is where Soha Ali Khan is filmed at the India Habitat Center that masquerades as the University of Delhi . On similar lines , New Delhi 's Modern School at Barakhamba Road served as the location for all the scenes pertinent to All India Radio station , which is shown to be stormed by the youngsters in the film . The Delhi Tourism department was happy to encourage filming in the city if it helped promote tourism , though any filming near India Gate was prohibited due to the ensuing bureaucratic paperwork . Similar issues with bureaucracy were faced by Mehra while filming at the Jaipur Fort . To use a historical location for filming , they had to seek permissions of seven officials ranging from the local police to the Archaeological Survey of India office . <unk> Fort , which oversees the city of Jaipur , was another such historical location where one of the songs was filmed . Besides these locations , the filming was also done at Amritsar 's <unk> Sahib Gurudwara . For Aamir Khan , a Muslim , it was for the first time that he was playing a North Indian Punjabi character and it took him some time to get the right dialect and diction . While speaking about his experience of visiting the Gurudwara for the first time , he said : 
 It 's one of the most peaceful places I 've been to . As you enter the place there 's a certain serenity that surrounds you . I really enjoyed being there . The first shot we took was of our feet entering the water just as you pass the doorway of the temple . The water was cold but it was great ! 
 Once the locations were finalized , the team of <unk> Bains and Arjun Bhasin was chosen for designing the look of Rang De Basanti . Bhasin had previously worked on Kama Sutra : A Tale of Love ( 1996 ) and Dil Chahta Hai ( 2001 ) , the latter of which featured Aamir Khan , and he was referred to Mehra by Khan due to their previous association . Since the film 's plot focused on men in their late twenties , Bhasin designed their look accordingly . Although he was responsible for Khan 's rebellious look , Sharman Joshi 's ( who played Sukhi ) lovable persona or Madhavan 's dignified appearance , Bhasin credited Bains for her major contributions to the film . Khan 's hair was styled by Avan Contractor , who came up with soft curls falling over Khan 's forehead . This new look , which took Contractor one hour to come up with , surprised the audience at the film 's launch . 
 In post @-@ production , the visual effects were handled by Tata Elxsi 's Visual Computing Labs . The military aircraft they created was so realistic that the Indian Air Force called to check the producer 's permission of using an actual MiG @-@ 21 .

 The soundtrack of Rang De Basanti , which was released by Sony BMG , featured music composed by A. R. Rahman and lyrics penned by Prasoon Joshi and <unk> , an India @-@ based rapper . From the film 's announcement in April 2005 , Rahman was slated to compose the music . In a press conference with pop singer Nelly Furtado , he said that she was to originally have featured on the soundtrack , although this was ultimately prevented from happening due to a change in producers and other factors . Aamir Khan , with his knowledge of Hindi and Urdu , worked with Rahman and Joshi for the soundtrack . In addition , Mehra and Rahman chose him to sing for one of the songs . 
 Joshi , one of the lyricists , was impressed with the director , Rakeysh Mehra , who was ready to adjust to his style of writing as well as his creativity . Confessing that the film 's soundtrack was his favorite out of all his previous works , Joshi felt that it " was a wonderful experience getting to know the mindset of today 's youth and to pen down their feelings " . Speaking about one of his songs , " Luka <unk> " , in which veteran Lata Mangeshkar sang with Rahman , Joshi said that it was developed while discussing with Rahman the scene about a mother losing her son . Joshi wrote the lyrics about the mother and son playing hide @-@ and @-@ seek with the sad reality of the son being hidden forever . He confessed to have been in tears while Mangeshkar was singing the song . The soundtrack won the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director , and had two of its tracks , <unk> and Luka <unk> , considered for an Academy Award for Best Original Song nomination . 
 While discussing typical Bollywood soundtracks , <unk> <unk> , a professor of music at Colorado College , noted that Rahman integrated traditional Punjabi cultural elements within his music for this soundtrack . Regionally defined elements such as a woman 's prayer at the Sikh Gurdwara ( Golden Temple ) and the bhangra harvest dance are incorporated alongside more contemporary , global styles such as hard rock and hip hop to depict the cosmopolitan lifestyle of the youngsters in the film .

 Rang De Basanti received its world premiere on 26 January 2006 , with high expectations that it would be a success with western audiences , though it also faced ire from several organizations because of certain controversial scenes . The film contained scenes of a MiG @-@ 21 , a controversial aircraft in the Indian Air Force , which has a long history of fatal accidents in India . Promptly , the Indian Defence Ministry raised concerns , causing the Indian censor board to urge the filmmakers to seek clearance from the ministry . Accordingly , Khan and Mehra screened the film for the then Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee along with other top officials from the armed forces . One Air Force official reportedly said that it was " not a review , but a preview " . After the special screening , the defence ministry did not insist on any cuts , but on their recommendation more names were added to the slide that dedicates the film to deceased MiG pilots . After this clearance , the Animal Welfare Board raised objections on the use of animals in the film . Although the filmmakers had obtained a No Objection Certificate from the board officials , Maneka Gandhi , a well @-@ known animal rights activist and member of the welfare board , found flaws in this certificate . Subsequently , this certificate was revoked and with only a few days left for the world premiere , Mehra personally requested Gandhi to reconsider her objection . After another viewing , the board cleared their objection stating that the use of animals in the film was natural and justified . However , after they recommended the deletion of a 20 @-@ second scene that depicted a banned horse race conducted by the <unk> Sikhs , the filmmakers deleted this scene . Mrs. Kavita Gadgil whose son , late Flight Lieutenant Abhijeet Gadgil was killed when his MiG @-@ 21 fighter crashed , objected to the film 's release because she believed that the film was loosely based on her son 's life and the producers should have shown her the film . In response , Kamlesh Pandey , one of the writers of the film , said that the film was not inspired by Abhijeet Gadgil . 
 The film was screened at several international film festivals . In 2006 , it premiered in France with the Lyon <unk> Film Festival , the Wisconsin Film Festival and the Morocco @-@ based International Film Festival of Marrakech . As a part of the publicity , the cast , visited prominent University campuses in New Delhi , Mumbai , Kolkata , Hyderabad and Pune with an intention of interacting with the students . After hiring international experts for the film 's publicity , the marketing expenditure for the film grew to 40 percent of the total production budget of ₹ 250 million ( US $ 3 @.@ 7 million ) . This expenditure was unprecedented in Bollywood because usually the Indian filmmakers spend only about five percent of their production budget on marketing . Out of the ₹ 100 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 5 million ) marketing campaign , a fifth of it came from the producers while the rest was obtained through brand tie @-@ ups and partnering . 
 Since Rahman 's last musical success , Saathiya , was back in 2002 , there were high expectations from the soundtrack in the media . The soundtrack , first released commercially in early December 2005 , generally received above average reviews . One of the songs , " Masti Ki <unk> " ( translation : " Classroom of Fun " ) , was voted as the " Song of the year " for 2006 by leading Indian television channels , while two compositions were considered for an Academy Award nomination . 
 Before its theatrical release , the producers tied up with several top brands to help in the marketing the film . An alliance was formed with The Coca @-@ Cola Company by releasing special edition bottles to commemorate the film 's release , a first of its kind in Bollywood . Besides this , the music CDs and cassettes were co @-@ branded with the cola company along with the launch of the sale of collectibles from the film . <unk> , a well @-@ known clothing retail chain in India , launched a special limited edition clothing merchandise targeting the youth of India . Besides these , the producers collaborated with LG Group , Berger Paints , Bharti Airtel and Hindustan Petroleum . The producers tied up with several media partners such as MSN India , Channel V and Radio Mirchi to further enhance their marketing efforts . A video game launched by an Indian mobile content company was based on an adaptation of the film 's plot . 
 In India , The Hindu reported that with audiences from the metropolitan cities turning out in large numbers , Rang De Basanti was notching up record collections in its opening week . Accordingly , 55 percent of the film 's revenues came from multiplexes in these cities . While the opening week box @-@ office collections from Mumbai , the home of Bollywood , were reported to be over ₹ 40 million ( US $ 590 @,@ 000 ) , theaters in New Delhi earned about half of Mumbai 's revenue . Throughout the country , the cumulative collections in the first week was about ₹ 80 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 2 million ) . Overseas collections from the United States , United Kingdom and Australia were collectively put at over ₹ 60 million ( US $ 890 @,@ 000 ) for the same week . Released in about 60 theaters in the United States , the film grossed ₹ 31 million ( US $ 460 @,@ 000 ) in its opening weekend and earned ₹ 99 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 5 million ) within 10 weeks . With ₹ 1 @.@ 23 billion ( US $ 18 million ) alone coming from the Indian territory , the film earned more than ₹ 1 @.@ 36 billion ( US $ 20 million ) worldwide . Currently , the film holds the record for the highest @-@ grossing film to be released in January . 
 Within a week of the film 's theatrical release , illegal copies of the film priced at ₹ 10 million ( US $ 150 @,@ 000 ) were seized at an Indian airport . A report carried out by The Times of India highlighted copyright infringement on the Internet where movies like Rang De Basanti could be downloaded freely . The DVD release sold more than 70 @,@ 000 copies over six months , and as a result the film was the highest selling title at the time of its release . 
 Rang De Basanti was released on Blu @-@ ray ( plus steelbook edition ) in May 2014 .
