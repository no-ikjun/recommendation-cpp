 When discussing his collaboration with Cyrus , Borgore stated that " you have to understand that I grew up in Israel , and the whole Hannah Montana thing , I 've never seen it . I 've heard about this , but the Miley Cyrus persona you might have in America I don 't have . " Her involvement with " Decisions " was originally not publicly acknowledged in an attempt to " make a tune together that we 're super happy about and just see people 's real opinion about this . " However , Cyrus unexpectedly tweeted " Yo check out Decisions me & @ <unk> new track " in August 2012 , which Borgore commented was " super cool [ that ] she did it the way she did it " . He added that he was impressed with her vocal abilities , elaborating that " I thought she was made up more to be a star , but she was pretty phenomenal behind the booth . " 
 " Decisions " is marked a musical departure from Cyrus ' earlier catalog and following the increasingly popular trend towards dance music . Lyrically , Borgore stated that " the very literal meaning of the song is how much girls love eating cake but the subliminal message is how people are attracted to money and power , and in order to succeed in life you need to work hard and attract those people that are there for the right reasons " . The line " bitches love cake " is repeatedly heard throughout the track ; Andy Hermann from <unk> interpreted the term " bitches " to be referring to " all superficial groupies who feed off of the success , beauty , and wealth of others . " 
 Borgore performed " Decisions " at the Music Box in Los Angeles on December 10 , 2012 . He had previously announced an appearance from a special guest , which was later revealed to be Cyrus . Jocelyn Vena from MTV News described it as " what might be one of her most risqué performances " , having worn sexually @-@ suggestive clothing and provocatively danced with a topless woman . In December 2013 , <unk> released a parody of " Decisions " , renamed " Kings of the Hunger Games " , to the iTunes Store . Its lyrics are reworked to reference The Hunger Games film series . The song charted at number 38 on the U.S. Billboard Dance / Electronic Songs component chart to the flagship Billboard Hot 100 , with sales of 5 @,@ 000 copies during the week of January 3 , 2014 .

 Upon its release , " Decisions " received generally favorable reviews from music critics , who appreciated Cyrus ' inclusion and its diversity from her earlier works , but were ambivalent towards its overall production . Writing for Gurl , Jessica Sager spoke favorably of Cyrus ' background vocal delivery , and called it " a far cry from " Party in the U.S.A. " , but it ’ s still pretty awesome . " Jenna Hally Rubenstein from MTV Buzzworthy shared a similar sentiment ; despite being disappointed with Cyrus ' limited appearance on the track , Rubenstein complimented that " cool element of melodic lushness " that her voice provided . Matt Oliver of OC Weekly opined that " having [ Cyrus ] sing on a dubstep track is impressive " , and felt that it did not come across in the " pop gimmick " fashion that Justin Bieber 's EDM @-@ inspired track " As Long as You Love Me " appeared to . 
 Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush called the overall track " catchy " and described the cake metaphor mentioned throughout the song to be " hilarious " . However , Kia Makarechi from The Huffington Post provided a more mixed review of " Decisions " , feeling that it was " neither particularly inventive nor that cathartic " . Writing for <unk> , Elliot Sachs was disappointed that Cyrus ' vocals came across as " faint and minuscule in comparison to all the brouhaha that is going on at the same time . " In February 2014 , Chris Wood from <unk> noted that " Decisions " became an " interesting pivot point " in Borgore 's career , which " pushed [ him ] into the early stages of a pop icon within electronic music scene " .

 An accompanying music video for " Decisions " was directed by Christian Lamb , and was filmed at <unk> 's Madhouse in Los Angeles , California . The final product was premiered through Borgore 's YouTube channel on November 1 , 2012 . The clip begins with in Venice Beach , where Borgore is seen bringing a large cake to an upscale party in Hollywood . Several people are seen dressed in costumes and throwing pieces of cake at one another , while Cyrus is later revealed to have been hiding in the cake . She also makes out with her then @-@ fiancé Liam Hemsworth , who appears dressed as a unicorn . Borgore 's ex @-@ girlfriend , pornographic actress Jessie Andrews , is also featured in the video . Nate Jones from Popdust though that its entire concept was " very confusing " , but said he " still wouldn ’ t mind hanging out in it for a while . Hillary Buss from Entertainment Weekly was surprised that Cyrus was involved in the project , stating that " if you had told me five years ago that Miley Cyrus would one day be featured on an Israeli DJ ’ s dubstep track , I would have scoffed and replied , ' Hannah Montana ? Are you serious ? Also , what ’ s dubstep ? ' "

 = Half @-@ Life : Blue Shift = 
 Half @-@ Life : Blue Shift is an expansion pack for Valve Software 's science fiction first @-@ person shooter video game Half @-@ Life . The game was developed by Gearbox Software with Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment on June 12 , 2001 ( it was originally set for release in Spring ) . Blue Shift is the second expansion for Half @-@ Life , originally intended as part of a Dreamcast version of the original game . Although the Dreamcast port was later cancelled , the PC version continued development and was released as a standalone product . The game was released on Steam on August 24 , 2005 . 
 As with Gearbox 's previous expansion pack Opposing Force , Blue Shift returns to the setting and events of the original game , but portrays the story through the eyes of another person . The protagonist in Blue Shift is a security guard , Barney Calhoun , employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility . After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens , Calhoun must fight his way to safety . The game received mostly positive reception . Many reviewers were critical of the short length of the game and the lack of new content , although the inclusion of a High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both Blue Shift and the preceding Half @-@ Life games was praised . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 As an expansion pack for Half @-@ Life , Blue Shift is a first @-@ person shooter . The overall gameplay of Blue Shift does not significantly differ from that of Half @-@ Life : players are required to navigate through the game 's levels , fight hostile non @-@ player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance . The game continues Half @-@ Life 's methods of an unbroken narrative . The player sees everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains in control of the player character for almost all of the game . Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes . Progress through the game 's world is continuous ; although the game is divided up into chapters , the only significant pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment . 
 The player battles through the game alone , but is occasionally assisted by friendly non @-@ player characters . Security guards and scientists will occasionally help the player in reaching new areas and convey relevant plot information . Blue Shift also includes a substantial section dedicated to keeping a major character in the story safe from enemy characters , and escorting him to a specific location . A selection of enemies from Half @-@ Life populate the game , including alien creatures such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts . The player also encounters human opponents in the form of a detachment of US Marines who have been sent to eliminate the alien threat and silence any witnesses . Blue Shift does not elaborate on the storyline in Opposing Force , the preceding expansion pack , and no enemy characters or weapons introduced in it appear in the game . The player is instead given access to a limited selection of Half @-@ Life 's original weaponry . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Blue Shift is set in the same location and time frame as that of Half @-@ Life , taking place at a remote New Mexico laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility . In Half @-@ Life , the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman , a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter @-@ dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen , allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility . The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal , ultimately traveling to Xen to do so . As in Opposing Force , Blue Shift shows the events of Half @-@ Life from the perspective of a different protagonist . The player assumes the role of Barney Calhoun , a security guard working near the labs where the accident takes place . Calhoun is responsible for the preservation of equipment and materials and the welfare of research personnel , and after the accident turns Black Mesa into a warzone , he must work with Dr. Rosenberg , a high @-@ ranking scientist involved in the experiment , to evacuate the facility . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Blue Shift begins in a similar manner to Half @-@ Life , as Barney Calhoun rides a train through the Black Mesa facility to reach his place of work . After reporting for duty , Calhoun is instructed to assist in maintenance on a malfunctioning elevator . As Calhoun finishes repairs , however , Freeman 's experiment takes place and results in a " resonance cascade " , causing massive damage to the facility and teleporting alien creatures into the base . The elevator is badly damaged and fails , sending Calhoun plummeting into the depths of Black Mesa . 
 Calhoun regains consciousness at the bottom of the shaft and begins to fight his way to the surface to escape . Emerging near Black Mesa 's classification yards , Calhoun learns that Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues plan to escape the facility using teleportation technology . After freeing Rosenberg from the captivity of the US Marines detachment sent to silence the facility , Calhoun escorts him to a decommissioned prototype teleportation laboratory , where several Black Mesa employees have already gathered . Rosenberg then teleports Calhoun to the Xen border world to calibrate research equipment needed to pinpoint a teleport destination outside of Black Mesa . Upon his return , Rosenberg informs Calhoun that the teleporter 's battery power has been exhausted , and contact has been lost with a team sent to acquire a new power cell . 
 Calhoun travels to the power generators on a lower level to find a fresh power cell while firefights rage between the Marines and the forces of Xen . After returning with a new power cell , Calhoun assists Rosenberg in evacuating the few surviving personnel through the teleporter . Calhoun is the last to enter the portal and as he does so , Marines breach the laboratory and fire on him , causing the teleporter to explode . As a result of the teleporter 's destruction , Calhoun enters a " harmonic reflux " , causing him to be rapidly teleported to a variety of locations in Xen and Black Mesa . At one location , he witnesses Freeman 's capture by Marines mid @-@ way through Half @-@ Life , before eventually stabilizing at the intended teleport location with Rosenberg at the outskirts of Black Mesa , where they then escape the facility in a company SUV .

 A second Half @-@ Life expansion pack , revolving around a security guard in the facility , was first announced in the second quarter of 2000 as part of an upcoming Dreamcast version of Half @-@ Life , under the working title Half @-@ Life : Guard Duty . Although the main Dreamcast port was to be developed by <unk> Digital Laboratories , the new expansion was to be developed by Gearbox Software , the same studio who developed Opposing Force . Publisher Sierra Entertainment later officially announced the expansion on August 30 , 2000 , revealing the name as Blue Shift . As with Opposing Force , the name Blue Shift has a double meaning , referring to both the blue shift light phenomenon , and the name of the shift that the protagonist is assigned to . The Dreamcast version of the game was set to include higher detail models and textures that were double the polygon count of Valve Software 's original Half @-@ Life models . At the European Computer Trade Show in September 2000 , information about Blue Shift 's story and development direction was revealed , along with a release date of November 1 , 2000 , for the Dreamcast version of Half @-@ Life . The game was delayed by Sierra to ensure the " high expectations of consumers " were met , anticipating release by the end of the year . Further media , gameplay and story information was released in the following weeks and months . Despite this , the Dreamcast version of Half @-@ Life still did not emerge , and speculation in May 2001 suggested the game would be cancelled . On June 16 , 2001 , Sierra terminated development on the Dreamcast version of Half @-@ Life , citing " changing market conditions " in a press release . GamePro magazine , however , received and published a 2 @-@ page review of the game . A late stage build of the Dreamcast version was eventually leaked to the Internet , featuring essentially complete versions of both Half @-@ Life and Blue Shift . 
 Although the Dreamcast version of Half @-@ Life was cancelled , Blue Shift persevered . Prior to the cancellation of the Dreamcast version , Sierra announced on March 29 , 2001 , that Blue Shift would be released for PC as well . The game would be released as a standalone expansion pack , a product that does not require the original Half @-@ Life to run . The new models developed for the Dreamcast version of Half @-@ Life would also be included in the PC version as the Half @-@ Life High Definition pack . In addition , Gearbox announced that the High Definition pack would not be exclusive for Blue Shift , but could be applied to both Half @-@ Life and Opposing Force as well . At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2001 , Gearbox announced that development of Blue Shift had been completed , and exhibited a playable version of the end product . The game was released on June 12 , 2001 . 
 Blue Shift and the High Definition pack were initially absent from the launch of Valve 's content delivery system Steam in September 2003 , despite the presence of both Half @-@ Life and Opposing Force on the system . The game was released on Steam on August 29 , 2005 along with the High Definition Pack . Blue Shift was also published as part of Sierra 's Half @-@ Life : Generation compilation in 2002 , and as part of Valve Software and Electronic Arts ' Half Life 1 : Anthology on September 26 , 2005 . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Blue Shift received a mixed reaction from critics , holding overall scores of 67 @.@ 40 % and 71 / 100 on the review aggregator sites GameRankings and Metacritic , respectively . The game has sold around 800 @,@ 000 copies at retail ( this figure does not include later sales on Steam ) . In a review for IGN , critic Tal Blevins noted that Blue Shift 's gameplay " is pretty much what we 've come to expect out of Half @-@ Life " by blending action and puzzle solving , stating that the latter " were all logical and well done , although some of the jumping puzzles were frustrating " . Though IGN praised the game for maintaining the " epic " feel of the original , Blevins was critical of the relatively short length of the game . GameSpot reviewer Greg Kasavin agreed with many of IGN 's criticisms , stating that " it 's not that the game is easy so much that it 's extremely short " and that Blue Shift " doesn 't amount to much on its own terms " . In addition , Kasavin described the graphical enhancements brought about by the High Definition pack as " helpful " , but noted that " they still don 't make Half @-@ Life look like a new game — nor are many of the changes themselves very noticeable " . 
 Other reviews echoed complaints about the similarity of Blue Shift to previous games . GameSpy 's reviewer Jamie Madigan stated that " what really pulls the game down is the ' more of the same ' factor " . Although writing that the game " feels like just a few more levels for the original game " , he noted that this is what Blue Shift was designed to be , given its origins as an add @-@ on for a Dreamcast version of Half @-@ Life . Madigan described the single @-@ player campaign as " decent " and commented that the High Definition pack made the game " worthy of consideration " . Eurogamer echoed criticism on the game 's length ; reviewer Tom Bradwell commented that " although I 'm hard pressed to criticize what you get , the complete absence of everything we 've learnt from the likes of Counter @-@ Strike and everything since is frankly bizarre " . Bradwell did , however , criticize the game 's artificial intelligence and the occasional bug that caused a player to get stuck on a wall . PC Zone 's Mark Hill was more lenient in his comments , praising the game 's artificial intelligence as " intelligent as you could hope an AI enemy to be " . In addition , Hill praised the game for showing more activity in the base , noting that " a whole world goes on around you , with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry . The complex is more alive than ever before " . Hill also praised the focus " on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than the two or three models that were cloned throughout the facility who kept repeating the same phrases " , describing this as Blue Shift 's " greatest achievement " . PC Zone 's review closed by commenting that " as a Dreamcast extra it works perfectly , but as a standalone PC title there 's not nearly enough to it . " 
 = Charles Allen Thomas = 
 Charles Allen Thomas ( February 15 , 1900 – March 29 , 1982 ) was a noted American chemist and businessman , and an important figure in the Manhattan Project . He held over 100 patents . 
 A graduate of Transylvania College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Thomas worked as a research chemist at General Motors as part of a team researching <unk> agents . This led to the development of tetraethyllead , which was widely used in motor fuels for many decades until its toxicity led to its prohibition . In 1926 , he and Carroll A. " Ted " Hochwalt co @-@ founded Thomas & Hochwalt Laboratories in Dayton , Ohio , with Thomas as president of the company . It was acquired by Monsanto in 1936 , and Thomas would spend the rest of his career with Monsanto , rising to become its president in 1950 , and chairman of the board from 1960 to 1965 . He researched the chemistry of hydrocarbons and polymers , and developed the proton theory of aluminium chloride , which helped explain a variety of chemical reactions , publishing a book on the subject in 1941 . 
 From 1943 to 1945 , he coordinated Manhattan Project work on plutonium purification and production . He also coordinated development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the triggers of atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project 's Dayton Project , part of which was conducted on the estate of his wife 's family . Shortly before the war ended , he took over the management of the Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge , Tennessee . Monsanto pulled out of Oak Ridge in December 1947 , but became the operator of the Mound Laboratories in 1948 . Secretary of State Dean Acheson appointed Thomas to serve on a 1946 panel to appraise international atomic inspection , which culminated in the Acheson – Lilienthal Report . In 1953 he was appointed as a consultant to the National Security Council , and served as U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Charles Allen Thomas was born on a farm in Scott County , Kentucky , the son of a Disciples of Christ minister , Charles Allen , and his wife Frances Carrick Thomas . His father died when he was six months old , and he and his mother went to live with his grandmother in Lexington , Kentucky , just across the street from Transylvania College . While living on the farm he was home schooled by his mother and grandmother . After moving to Lexington he attended Hamilton College 's preparatory school , and then Morton High School . When he was 16 , he entered Transylvania College , which awarded him his Bachelor of Arts ( AB ) degree in 1920 . During World War I , he served in the Student Army Training Corps , and for a time was a rifle instructor at Camp Perry . He then entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , from which he received a Master of Science ( MS ) degree , majoring in chemistry , in 1924 . To help pay for his tuition , he worked as a professional singer , and for a time he considered a career as a vocalist . His singing voice was described by his son as a high baritone . 
 In 1923 Charles F. Kettering and Carroll A. " Ted " Hochwalt recruited Thomas to work as a research chemist at General Motors ( GM ) . There , he worked with Thomas Midgley , Jr . , as part of Kettering 's team researching <unk> agents . This led to the development of tetraethyllead , which was used in motor fuels for many years before being banned in most parts of the world as a poison . At General Motors , Thomas also worked on a process for extracting bromine from sea water , and with Midgely on making synthetic rubber from isoprene . Thomas left General Motors in 1924 for a job as a research chemist , a joint venture between GM and Esso to make and sell tetraethyllead gasoline additives . 
 Thomas married Margaret Stoddard Talbott , the sister of Harold E. Talbott , Jr. on September 25 , 1926 . They had four children : Charles Allen Thomas III , Margaret Talbott , Frances Carrick , and Katharine Tudor . That year , he and Hochwalt co @-@ founded Thomas & Hochwalt Laboratories in Dayton , Ohio , with Thomas as president of the company . The company carried out research for various companies , looking into such diverse subjects as a fire extinguisher that would not freeze in unheated buildings , and a means to speed up the aging of whiskey . Their work attracted the attention of Edgar Monsanto <unk> , the chairman of Monsanto , who bought Thomas & Hochwalt Laboratories for $ 1 @.@ 4 million in Monsanto stock in 1936 . <unk> moved Thomas to St Louis , Missouri , where he became director of Central Research , while Hochwalt remained in Dayton to work on <unk> , Monsanto 's acrylic fiber . 
 Thomas would spend the rest of his career with Monsanto , becoming a member of its board of directors in 1942 , vice president in 1943 , executive vice president in 1947 , president in 1950 , and ultimately chairman of the board from 1960 to 1965 . He subsequently served as chairman of Monsanto 's Finance Committee frm 1965 to 1968 . He retired in 1970 . In this time , Monsanto 's annual sales grew from $ 34 million to $ 1 @.@ 9 billion , and its expenditure on research from $ 6 @.@ 2 million to 101 @.@ 4 million . He researched the chemistry of hydrocarbons and polymers . In studying the chemical reactions between alkenes and dienes , particularly in the presence of an aluminium chloride catalyst , he developed the proton theory of aluminium chloride , which helped explain a variety of chemical reactions , including cracking , polymerization and dehydrogenation . This research culminated in the publication of his book Anhydrous Aluminum Chloride in Organic Chemistry in 1941 . 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 In December 1942 , during World War II , Thomas joined the National Defense Research Committee ( NDRC ) as the Deputy Chief of its Division 8 , which was responsible for propellants , explosives and the like . Early in 1943 , he travelled to the East with Richard Tolman , a member of the NDRC , and James B. Conant , the president of Harvard University and the chairman of the NDRC , to witness a demonstration of a new underwater explosive . Conant and Tolman took the opportunity to quietly investigate Thomas 's background . Thomas was then invited to a meeting in Washington DC with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , the director of the Manhattan Project , and , as he discovered when he got there , Conant . 
 Groves and Conant were hoping to harness his industrial expertise for the benefit of the project . They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer , at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico , but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto . Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at Los Alamos , the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago , Radiation laboratory in Berkeley , and Ames Laboratory in Iowa . Monsanto 's Central Research Department began to conduct research on behalf of the Manhattan Project as part of the Manhattan Project 's Dayton Project , some of which was conducted on the estate of his wife 's family . 
 Initially , there were concerns about the purity of plutonium , an element about which little was known , but Thomas was able to report to Groves and Conant in June 1944 that techniques had been developed that would yield highly pure plutonium , and that the problem was solved . Unfortunately , experiments by Emilio G. Segrè and his P @-@ 5 Group at Los Alamos on reactor @-@ produced plutonium showed that it contained impurities in the form of the isotope plutonium @-@ 240 , which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium @-@ 239 , making it unsuitable for use in the Thin Man gun @-@ type nuclear weapon design . 
 Thomas attended a series of crisis meetings in Chicago with <unk> , Groves , Arthur Compton , Kenneth Nichols and Enrico Fermi . It was agreed that the isotopes could not be separated , so high @-@ purity plutonium would not be required . Thomas therefore decided to disband his plutonium purification team . The Los Alamos laboratory then turned to the technologically much more difficult task of building an implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon . 
 Monsanto was already working on a key component of the device . In April 1943 , Robert Serber had proposed that instead of relying on spontaneous fission , the chain reaction inside the bomb should be triggered by a neutron initiator . The best @-@ known neutron sources were radium @-@ beryllium and polonium @-@ beryllium . The later was chosen as it had a 140 @-@ day half life , which made it intense enough to be useful but long @-@ lived enough to be stockpiled . Thomas brought in Monsanto to work on the development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the urchin detonators . 
 Thomas established the project in the Runnymede Playhouse on the grounds of his wife 's family estate in a wealthy residential section of Oakwood , a suburb of Dayton . He promised the Oakwood City Council that he would return the Runnymede Playhouse building intact after the war , but he was unable to keep this promise because the building became so badly contaminated with radioactivity . The facility , also known as Dayton Unit IV , was in use for nuclear work until 1949 when Mound Laboratories opened in Miamisburg , Ohio . The Playhouse was dismantled in 1950 , and buried in Oak Ridge , Tennessee . 
 Thomas was one of a number of scientists who watched their work come to fruition on July 16 , 1945 , at the Trinity nuclear test . For his work on the project , he received the Medal for Merit from the president Harry S. Truman in 1946 . On May 2 , 1945 , Groves and Thomas agreed that Monsanto would take over the running of the Clinton laboratories at Oak Ridge , Tennessee from July 1 , 1945 . Thomas brought in some 60 new staff from Dayton to help run the Clinton Laboratories , and he persuaded Eugene Wigner to come from Chicago to work on new reactor designs . Under Wigner , the Laboratories made a pioneering study of Wigner 's disease , the swelling and distortion of the graphite used as a moderator in reactors due the neutron bombardment produced in a reactor . Thomas became frustrated with restrictions on spending and the uncertainty about the future of the laboratory . In May 1947 , he decided not to renew the contract with the Atomic Energy Commission to operate the Clinton Laboratories on a month @-@ to @-@ month basis while a new operator was found . Union Carbide took over the contract in December 1947 . Monsanto was , however , given the contract to operate the new Mound Laboratories in early 1948 .

 In 1946 Secretary of State Dean Acheson appointed Thomas to serve on a panel with Robert Oppenheimer , David Lilienthal , Chester I. Barnard and Harry Winne to appraise international atomic inspection , culminating in the Acheson – Lilienthal Report . In 1951 Truman appointed Thomas to the Science Advisory Committee , an eleven @-@ man committee of prominent scientists to advise on defense planning . In 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him a scientific consultant to the National Security Council , and he was the U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission . In the wake of the Sputnik crisis , Thomas was part of a group that persuaded Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy to establish DARPA . 
 Thomas served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Universities Research Association , a curator of Transylvania College , chairman of the board of trustees of Washington University , a member of the Corporation that runs MIT , and the chairman of the board of directors of the Washington University Medical Center . He was also member of the board of directors of several companies , including <unk> Corporation , Southwestern Bell , St. Louis Union Trust , the First National Bank in St. Louis , the Central Institute for the Deaf , Metropolitan Life Insurance , RAND Corporation and the Civic Center Redevelopment Corporation of St. Louis . He was involved with organizations including the Boy Scouts of America , Radio Free Europe and the St Louis Research Council . 
 Thomas was elected to the National Academy of Sciences at age forty @-@ eight and was one of the founding members of the National Academy of Engineering . He was also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . In addition , he received over 100 patents , the Industrial Research Institute Medal in 1947 , the American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal in 1948 , the Missouri Award for Distinguished Service in Engineering in 1952 , the Society of Chemical Industry 's Perkin Medal in 1953 , the American Chemical Society Priestley Medal in 1955 , the Societe de Chimie Industrielle Palladium Medal in 1963 , the American Academy of Achievement Gold Plate Award in 1965 , and the St. Louis Globe @-@ Democrat Man of the Year award in 1966 . 
 Thomas was concerned that the United States did not spend enough money on basic research . To this end he donated $ 600 @,@ 000 to Washington University in St. Louis as an endowment for a chair , the Charles Allen Thomas Professor of Chemistry . He rejected the notion large corporations as being driven solely or mainly by greed . In a 1952 speech he enjoined his fellow businessmen to " remember that our businesses and their profits are only a means to an end , a means toward making Americans happier and America a stronger and more unified nation . " 
 In retirement , Thomas spent much of his time managing Magnolia Plantation , a 15 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 6 @,@ 100 ha ) family farm near Albany , Georgia , where he employed a staff of 50 and grew peanuts , pecans , soybeans , corn and timber . His first wife died in 1975 , and he married Margaret Chandler Porter in 1980 . He died at his farm on March 29 , 1982 . He was survived by his second wife and four children . His papers are collected at Washington University . 
 = Amino acid = 
 Amino acids are biologically important organic compounds containing amine ( -NH2 ) and carboxylic acid ( <unk> ) functional groups , usually along with a side @-@ chain ( R group ) specific to each amino acid . The key elements of an amino acid are carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and nitrogen , though other elements are found in the side @-@ chains of certain amino acids . About 500 amino acids are known ( though only 20 appear in the genetic code ) and can be classified in many ways . They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups ' locations as alpha- ( α- ) , beta- ( β- ) , gamma- ( γ- ) or <unk> ( <unk> ) amino acids ; other categories relate to polarity , pH level , and side @-@ chain group type ( aliphatic , acyclic , aromatic , containing hydroxyl or sulfur , etc . ) . In the form of proteins , amino acids comprise the second @-@ largest component ( water is the largest ) of human muscles , cells and other tissues . Outside proteins , amino acids perform critical roles in processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis . 
 In biochemistry , amino acids having both the amine and the carboxylic acid groups attached to the first ( alpha- ) carbon atom have particular importance . They are known as 2- , alpha- , or α @-@ amino acids ( generic formula <unk> in most cases , where R is an organic substituent known as a " side @-@ chain " ) ; often the term " amino acid " is used to refer specifically to these . They include the 23 proteinogenic ( " protein @-@ building " ) amino acids , which combine into peptide chains ( " polypeptides " ) to form the building @-@ blocks of a vast array of proteins . These are all L @-@ stereoisomers ( " left @-@ handed " isomers ) , although a few D @-@ amino acids ( " right @-@ handed " ) occur in bacterial envelopes , as a neuromodulator ( D @-@ serine ) , and in some antibiotics . Twenty of the proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet codons in the genetic code and are known as " standard " amino acids . The other three ( " non @-@ standard " or " non @-@ canonical " ) are selenocysteine ( present in many <unk> as well as most eukaryotes , but not coded directly by DNA ) , pyrrolysine ( found only in some archea and one bacterium ) and N @-@ formylmethionine ( which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria , mitochondria , and chloroplasts ) . Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons ; for example , selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and SECIS element . Codon – tRNA combinations not found in nature can also be used to " expand " the genetic code and create novel proteins known as <unk> incorporating non @-@ proteinogenic amino acids . 
 Many important proteinogenic and non @-@ proteinogenic amino acids also play critical non @-@ protein roles within the body . For example , in the human brain , glutamate ( standard glutamic acid ) and gamma @-@ amino @-@ butyric acid ( " GABA " , non @-@ standard gamma @-@ amino acid ) are , respectively , the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters ; hydroxyproline ( a major component of the connective tissue collagen ) is synthesised from proline ; the standard amino acid glycine is used to synthesise porphyrins used in red blood cells ; and the non @-@ standard carnitine is used in lipid transport . 
 Nine proteinogenic amino acids are called " essential " for humans because they cannot be created from other compounds by the human body and so must be taken in as food . Others may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions . Essential amino acids may also differ between species . 
 Because of their biological significance , amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in nutritional supplements , fertilizers , and food technology . Industrial uses include the production of drugs , biodegradable plastics , and chiral catalysts .

 The first few amino acids were discovered in the early 19th century . In 1806 , French chemists Louis @-@ Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean <unk> isolated a compound in asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine , the first amino acid to be discovered . Cystine was discovered in 1810 , although its monomer , cysteine , remained undiscovered until 1884 . Glycine and leucine were discovered in 1820 . The last of the 20 common amino acids to be discovered was threonine in 1935 by William Cumming Rose , who also determined the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth . 
 Usage of the term amino acid in the English language is from 1898 . Proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid hydrolysis . In 1902 , Emil Fischer and Franz Hofmeister proposed that proteins are the result of the formation of bonds between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another , in a linear structure that Fischer termed " peptide " . 
 = = General structure = = 
 In the structure shown at the top of the page , R represents a side @-@ chain specific to each amino acid . The carbon atom next to the carboxyl group ( which is therefore numbered 2 in the carbon chain starting from that functional group ) is called the α – carbon . Amino acids containing an amino group bonded directly to the alpha carbon are referred to as alpha amino acids . These include amino acids such as proline which contain secondary amines , which used to be often referred to as " imino acids " . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The alpha amino acids are the most common form found in nature , but only when occurring in the L @-@ isomer . The alpha carbon is a chiral carbon atom , with the exception of glycine which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the alpha carbon . Therefore , all alpha amino acids but glycine can exist in either of two enantiomers , called L or D amino acids , which are mirror images of each other ( see also Chirality ) . While L @-@ amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome , D @-@ amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum , as in exotic sea @-@ dwelling organisms such as cone snails . They are also abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria , and D @-@ serine may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain . D @-@ amino acids are used in racemic crystallography to create centrosymmetric crystals , which ( depending on the protein ) may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination . The L and D convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can , in theory , be synthesized ( D @-@ glyceraldehyde is <unk> ; L @-@ glyceraldehyde is <unk> ) . In alternative fashion , the ( S ) and ( R ) designators are used to indicate the absolute stereochemistry . Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are ( S ) at the α carbon , with cysteine being ( R ) and glycine non @-@ chiral . Cysteine has its side @-@ chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids , but the R / S terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of sulfur compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side @-@ chain a higher priority , whereas the atoms in most other side @-@ chains give them lower priority . 
 = = = Side chains = = = 
 In amino acids that have a carbon chain attached to the α – carbon ( such as lysine , shown to the right ) the carbons are labeled in order as α , β , γ , δ , and so on . In some amino acids , the amine group is attached to the β or γ @-@ carbon , and these are therefore referred to as beta or gamma amino acids . 
 Amino acids are usually classified by the properties of their side @-@ chain into four groups . The side @-@ chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base , and a <unk> if the side @-@ chain is polar or a <unk> if it is nonpolar . The chemical structures of the 22 standard amino acids , along with their chemical properties , are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids . 
 The phrase " branched @-@ chain amino acids " or <unk> refers to the amino acids having aliphatic side @-@ chains that are non @-@ linear ; these are leucine , isoleucine , and valine . <unk> is the only proteinogenic amino acid whose side @-@ group links to the α @-@ amino group and , thus , is also the only proteinogenic amino acid containing a secondary amine at this position . In chemical terms , proline is , therefore , an imino acid , since it lacks a primary amino group , although it is still classed as an amino acid in the current biochemical nomenclature , and may also be called an " N @-@ alkylated alpha @-@ amino acid " . 
 = = = Zwitterions = = = 
 The α @-@ carboxylic acid group of amino acids is a weak acid , meaning that it releases a hydron ( such as a proton ) at moderate pH values . In other words , carboxylic acid groups ( − <unk> ) can be deprotonated to become negative carboxylates ( − CO2 − ) . The negatively charged carboxylate ion predominates at pH values greater than the pKa of the carboxylic acid group ( mean for the 20 common amino acids is about 2 @.@ 2 , see the table of amino acid structures above ) . In a complementary fashion , the α @-@ amine of amino acids is a weak base , meaning that it accepts a proton at moderate pH values . In other words , α @-@ amino groups ( NH2 − ) can be protonated to become positive α @-@ ammonium groups ( + NH3 − ) . The positively charged α @-@ ammonium group predominates at pH values less than the pKa of the α @-@ ammonium group ( mean for the 20 common α @-@ amino acids is about 9 @.@ 4 ) . 
 Because all amino acids contain amine and carboxylic acid functional groups , they share <unk> properties . Below pH 2 @.@ 2 , the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive α @-@ ammonium ion ( net charge + 1 ) , and above pH 9 @.@ 4 , a negative carboxylate and neutral α @-@ amino group ( net charge − 1 ) . But at pH between 2 @.@ 2 and 9 @.@ 4 , an amino acid usually contains both a negative carboxylate and a positive α @-@ ammonium group , as shown in structure ( 2 ) on the right , so has net zero charge . This molecular state is known as a zwitterion , from the German <unk> meaning hermaphrodite or hybrid . The fully neutral form ( structure ( 1 ) on the right ) is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout the pH range ( less than 1 part in 107 ) . Amino acids exist as <unk> also in the solid phase , and crystallize with salt @-@ like properties unlike typical organic acids or amines . 
 = = = <unk> point = = = 
 The variation in titration curves when the amino acids are grouped by category can be seen here . With the exception of tyrosine , using titration to differentiate between hydrophobic amino acids is problematic . 
 At pH values between the two pKa values , the zwitterion predominates , but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions . At the exact midpoint between the two pKa values , the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance , so that average net charge of all forms present is zero . This pH is known as the isoelectric point pI , so pI 
 = ½ ( pKa1 + pKa2 ) . The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values , so have different isoelectric points . For amino acids with charged side @-@ chains , the pKa of the side @-@ chain is involved . Thus for Asp , Glu with negative side @-@ chains , pI = 
 ½ ( pKa1 + pKaR ) , where pKaR is the side @-@ chain pKa . Cysteine also has potentially negative side @-@ chain with pKaR 
 = 8 @.@ 14 , so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu , even though the side @-@ chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH . For His , Lys , and Arg with positive side @-@ chains , pI = 
 ½ ( pKaR + pKa2 ) . Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point , although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids . Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids ( in particular , with non @-@ polar side @-@ chains ) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point .

 = = = <unk> amino acids = = = 
 Amino acids are the structural units ( monomers ) that make up proteins . They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins . These polymers are linear and unbranched , with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids . The process of making proteins is called translation and involves the step @-@ by @-@ step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome . The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template , which is a RNA copy of one of the organism 's genes . 
 Twenty @-@ two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids . Of these , 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code . The remaining 2 , selenocysteine and pyrrolysine , are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms . Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a SECIS element , which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a stop codon . Pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane . It is coded for with the codon UAG , which is normally a stop codon in other organisms . This UAG codon is followed by a <unk> downstream sequence . 
 = = = Non @-@ proteinogenic amino acids = = = 
 Aside from the 22 proteinogenic amino acids , there are many other amino acids that are called non @-@ proteinogenic . Those either are not found in proteins ( for example carnitine , GABA ) or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery ( for example , hydroxyproline and selenomethionine ) . 
 Non @-@ proteinogenic amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by post @-@ translational modification , which is modification after translation during protein synthesis . These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein ; for example , the carboxylation of glutamate allows for better binding of calcium cations , and the hydroxylation of proline is critical for maintaining connective tissues . Another example is the formation of <unk> in the translation initiation factor <unk> , through modification of a lysine residue . Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein , e.g. , the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a phospholipid membrane . 
 Some non @-@ proteinogenic amino acids are not found in proteins . Examples include lanthionine , 2 @-@ aminoisobutyric acid , <unk> , and the neurotransmitter gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid . Non @-@ proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids – for example , ornithine and <unk> occur in the urea cycle , part of amino acid catabolism ( see below ) . A rare exception to the dominance of α @-@ amino acids in biology is the β @-@ amino acid beta alanine ( 3 @-@ <unk> acid ) , which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid ( vitamin B5 ) , a component of coenzyme A. 
 = = = D @-@ amino acid natural abundance = = = 
 D @-@ isomers are uncommon in live organisms . For instance , gramicidin is a polypeptide made up from mixture of D- and L @-@ amino acids . Other compounds containing D @-@ amino acids are <unk> and <unk> . These compounds disrupt bacterial cell walls , particularly in Gram @-@ positive bacteria . Only 837 D @-@ amino acids were found in Swiss @-@ <unk> database ( 187 million amino acids analysed ) . 
 = = = Non @-@ standard amino acids = = = 
 The 20 amino acids that are encoded directly by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids . The others are called non @-@ standard or non @-@ canonical . Most of the non @-@ standard amino acids are also non @-@ proteinogenic ( i.e. they cannot be used to build proteins ) , but three of them are proteinogenic , as they can be used to build proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code . 
 The three non @-@ standard proteinogenic amino acids are selenocysteine ( present in many non @-@ eukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes , but not coded directly by DNA ) , pyrrolysine ( found only in some archaea and one bacterium ) , and N @-@ formylmethionine ( which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria , mitochondria , and chloroplasts ) . For example , 25 human proteins include selenocysteine ( Sec ) in their primary structure , and the structurally characterized enzymes ( selenoenzymes ) employ Sec as the catalytic moiety in their active sites . Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons . For example , selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and SECIS element . 
 = = = In human nutrition = = = 
 When taken up into the human body from the diet , the 20 standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy . The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase ; the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle . The other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle . <unk> amino acids can also be converted into glucose , through gluconeogenesis . Of the 20 standard amino acids , nine ( His , Ile , Leu , Lys , Met , Phe , Thr , Trp and Val ) , are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth , so they must be obtained from food . In addition , cysteine , taurine , tyrosine , and arginine are considered <unk> amino @-@ acids in children ( though taurine is not technically an amino acid ) , because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed . The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual , so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids . Dietary exposure to the non @-@ standard amino acid BMAA has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases , including ALS . 
 = = = Non @-@ protein functions = = = 
 In humans , non @-@ protein amino acids also have important roles as metabolic intermediates , such as in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter gamma @-@ amino @-@ butyric acid ( GABA ) . Many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules , for example : 
 <unk> is a precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin . 
 Tyrosine ( and its precursor phenylalanine ) are precursors of the catecholamine neurotransmitters dopamine , epinephrine and norepinephrine and various trace amines . 
 Phenylalanine is a precursor of phenethylamine and tyrosine in humans . In plants , it is a precursor of various phenylpropanoids , which are important in plant metabolism . 
 Glycine is a precursor of porphyrins such as heme . 
 Arginine is a precursor of nitric oxide . 
 Ornithine and S @-@ adenosylmethionine are precursors of polyamines . 
 Aspartate , glycine , and glutamine are precursors of nucleotides . 
 However , not all of the functions of other abundant non @-@ standard amino acids are known . 
 Some non @-@ standard amino acids are used as defenses against herbivores in plants . For example , <unk> is an analogue of arginine that is found in many legumes , and in particularly large amounts in Canavalia <unk> ( sword bean ) . This amino acid protects the plants from predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing . The non @-@ protein amino acid <unk> is found in other species of legume , in particular Leucaena leucocephala . This compound is an analogue of tyrosine and can poison animals that graze on these plants . 
 = = Uses in industry = = 
 Amino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry , but their main use is as additives to animal feed . This is necessary , since many of the bulk components of these feeds , such as soybeans , either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids : lysine , methionine , threonine , and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds . In this industry , amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements , which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals . 
 The food industry is also a major consumer of amino acids , in particular , glutamic acid , which is used as a flavor enhancer , and aspartame ( <unk> @-@ phenylalanine @-@ 1 @-@ methyl ester ) as a low @-@ calorie artificial sweetener . Similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in the human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies , such as anemia , by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation . 
 The chelating ability of amino acids has been used in fertilizers for agriculture to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies , such as iron chlorosis . These fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies from occurring and improving the overall health of the plants . The remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of drugs and cosmetics . 
 Similarly , some amino acids derivatives are used in pharmaceutical industry . They include 5 @-@ HTP ( 5 @-@ <unk> ) used for experimental treatment of depression , L @-@ DOPA ( L @-@ dihydroxyphenylalanine ) for Parkinson 's treatment , and <unk> drug that inhibits ornithine decarboxylase and used in the treatment of sleeping sickness . 
 = = = Expanded genetic code = = = 
 Since 2001 , 40 non @-@ natural amino acids have been added into protein by creating a unique codon ( recoding ) and a corresponding transfer @-@ RNA : aminoacyl – tRNA @-@ synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins . 
 = = = Nullomers = = = 
 Nullomers are codons that in theory code for an amino acid , however in nature there is a selective bias against using this codon in favor of another , for example bacteria prefer to use CGA instead of AGA to code for arginine . This creates some sequences that do not appear in the genome . This characteristic can be taken advantage of and used to create new selective cancer @-@ fighting drugs and to prevent cross @-@ contamination of DNA samples from crime @-@ scene investigations . 
 = = = Chemical building blocks = = = 
 Amino acids are important as low @-@ cost feedstocks . These compounds are used in chiral pool synthesis as enantiomerically pure building @-@ blocks . 
 Amino acids have been investigated as precursors chiral catalysts , e.g. , for asymmetric hydrogenation reactions , although no commercial applications exist . 
 = = = <unk> plastics = = = 
 Amino acids are under development as components of a range of biodegradable polymers . These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants . These polymers include polypeptides , polyamides , polyesters , polysulfides , and <unk> with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side @-@ chains . These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers . An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate , a water @-@ soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture . Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions , polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti @-@ scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor . In addition , the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of <unk> . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 As amino acids have both a primary amine group and a primary carboxyl group , these chemicals can undergo most of the reactions associated with these functional groups . These include nucleophilic addition , amide bond formation , and imine formation for the amine group , and esterification , amide bond formation , and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group . The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective <unk> ligands for metal @-@ amino acid <unk> . The multiple side @-@ chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions . The types of these reactions are determined by the groups on these side @-@ chains and are , therefore , different between the various types of amino acid . 
 = = = Chemical synthesis = = = 
 Several methods exist to synthesize amino acids . One of the oldest methods begins with the bromination at the α @-@ carbon of a carboxylic acid . <unk> substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid . In alternative fashion , the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia , this produces an α @-@ amino nitrile as an intermediate . Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α @-@ amino acid . Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids , whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids . Likewise , using ketones , instead of aldehydes , gives α , α @-@ disubstituted amino acids . The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α @-@ amino acids as products , but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed . 
 At the current time , the most @-@ adopted method is an automated synthesis on a solid support ( e.g. , polystyrene beads ) , using protecting groups ( e.g. , <unk> and t @-@ Boc ) and activating groups ( e.g. , DCC and DIC ) . 
 = = = Peptide bond formation = = = 
 As both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds , one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage . This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins . This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water . In cells , this reaction does not occur directly ; instead , the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond . This aminoacyl @-@ tRNA is produced in an ATP @-@ dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase . This aminoacyl @-@ tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome , which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond . As a result of this mechanism , all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N @-@ terminus and moving toward their C @-@ terminus . 
 However , not all peptide bonds are formed in this way . In a few cases , peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes . For example , the <unk> glutathione is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress . This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids . In the first step , gamma @-@ <unk> synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side @-@ chain carboxyl of the glutamate ( the gamma carbon of this side @-@ chain ) and the amino group of the cysteine . This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione . 
 In chemistry , peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions . One of the most @-@ used in solid @-@ phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units . These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain , which is attached to a solid resin support . The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids ( using combinatorial chemistry ) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through high @-@ throughput screening . 
 = = = Biosynthesis = = = 
 In plants , nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of glutamate , formed from alpha @-@ ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion . In order to form other amino acids , the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha @-@ keto carboxylic acid . For example , aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha @-@ ketoglutarate and aspartate . Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis , too . 
 <unk> amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids . For example , homocysteine is formed through the <unk> pathway or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite S @-@ adenosyl methionine , while hydroxyproline is made by a posttranslational modification of proline . 
 Microorganisms and plants can synthesize many uncommon amino acids . For example , some microbes make 2 @-@ aminoisobutyric acid and lanthionine , which is a sulfide @-@ bridged derivative of alanine . Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic <unk> such as alamethicin . However , in plants , 1 @-@ <unk> @-@ 1 @-@ carboxylic acid is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in the production of the plant hormone ethylene . 
 = = = Catabolism = = = 
 Amino acids must first pass out of organelles and cells into blood circulation via amino acid transporters , since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized . Degradation of an amino acid , occurring in the liver and kidneys , often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha @-@ ketoglutarate , forming glutamate . This process involves transaminases , often the same as those used in amination during synthesis . In many vertebrates , the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea . However , amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead . For example , serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia . After removal of one or more amino groups , the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids , or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle , as detailed in image at right . 
 = = <unk> properties of amino acids = = 
 The 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties . Important factors are charge , hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity , size , and functional groups . These properties are important for protein structure and protein – protein interactions . The water @-@ soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues ( Leu , Ile , Val , Phe , and Trp ) buried in the middle of the protein , whereas hydrophilic side @-@ chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent . ( Note that in biochemistry , a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide , protein or nucleic acid . ) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer . In the case part @-@ way between these two extremes , some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane . In similar fashion , proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate , while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine . There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues . 
 Some amino acids have special properties such as cysteine , that can form covalent disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues , proline that forms a cycle to the polypeptide backbone , and glycine that is more flexible than other amino acids . 
 Many proteins undergo a range of posttranslational modifications , when additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acids in proteins . Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins , or hydrophilic glycoproteins . These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane . For example , the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes . 
 = = = Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties = = = 
 Two additional amino acids are in some species coded for by codons that are usually interpreted as stop codons : 
 In addition to the specific amino acid codes , placeholders are used in cases where chemical or crystallographic analysis of a peptide or protein cannot conclusively determine the identity of a residue . They are also used to summarise conserved protein sequence motifs . The use of single letters to indicate sets of similar residues is similar to the use of abbreviation codes for degenerate bases . 
 Unk is sometimes used instead of <unk> , but is less standard . 
 In addition , many non @-@ standard amino acids have a specific code . For example , several peptide drugs , such as Bortezomib and MG132 , are artificially synthesized and retain their protecting groups , which have specific codes . Bortezomib is <unk> @-@ Phe @-@ <unk> , and MG132 is Z @-@ Leu @-@ Leu @-@ Leu @-@ al . To aid in the analysis of protein structure , photo @-@ reactive amino acid analogs are available . These include <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 = Adaptation ( film ) = 
 Adaptation ( stylized as Adaptation . , with the period included ) is a 2002 American comedy <unk> directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman . The film is based on Susan Orlean 's non @-@ fiction book The Orchid Thief , with numerous self @-@ referential events added . The film stars Nicolas Cage as Charlie and Donald Kaufman , and Meryl Streep as Susan Orlean , Chris Cooper as John Laroche , with Cara Seymour , Brian Cox , Tilda Swinton , Ron Livingston and Maggie Gyllenhaal in supporting roles . 
 Though the film is billed as an adaptation of The Orchid Thief , its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman 's struggle to adapt The Orchid Thief into a film , while dramatizing the events of the book in parallel . Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements , including Kaufman 's twin brother ( also credited as a writer for the film ) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche , and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in The Orchid Thief , Kaufman and his fictional twin brother . 
 The film had been in development as far back as 1994 . Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script . Kaufman experienced writer 's block and did not know what to think of The Orchid Thief . Finally he wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay . Jonze signed to direct , and filming was finished in June 2001 . Adaptation received awards at the 75th Academy Awards , 60th Golden Globe Awards and 56th British Academy Film Awards . Cooper won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor , while Kaufman won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The self @-@ loathing Charlie Kaufman is hired to write the screenplay for The Orchid Thief . Kaufman is going through depression and is not happy that his twin brother , Donald , has moved into his house and is taking advantage of him . Donald decides to become a screenwriter like Charlie and attends one of Robert McKee 's famous seminars . 
 Charlie , who rejects formulaic script writing , wants to ensure that his script is a faithful adaptation of The Orchid Thief . However , he comes to realize that the book does not have a usable narrative and that it is impossible to turn into a film , leaving him with a serious case of writer 's block . Already well over his deadline with Columbia Pictures , and despairing at writing his script with self @-@ reference , Charlie travels to New York to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly . Unable to face her and with the surprising news that Donald 's spec script for a clichéd psychological thriller , called The 3 , is selling for six or seven figures , Kaufman resorts to attending McKee 's seminar in New York and asks him for advice . Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure . 
 Donald pretends to be Charlie and interviews Orlean , but is suspicious of her account of the events of her book because she acts as though she is lying . He and his brother Charlie follow Orlean to Florida where she meets Laroche , the orchid @-@ stealing protagonist of Orlean 's book and her secret lover . It is revealed that the Seminole wanted the ghost orchid in order to manufacture a drug that causes fascination ; Laroche introduces this drug to Orlean . After Laroche and Orlean catch Charlie observing them taking the drug and having sex , she decides that Charlie must die . 
 Orlean forces Charlie at gunpoint to drive to the swamp , where she intends to kill him . Charlie and Donald escape and hide in the swamp , where they resolve their differences and Charlie 's problems with women . Laroche accidentally shoots Donald . Fleeing , Charlie and Donald drive off but crash into a ranger 's truck ; Donald dies in the accident . Charlie runs off into the swamp to hide but is spotted by Laroche . However , Laroche is killed by an alligator before being able to kill Charlie . 
 Orlean is arrested . Charlie makes up with his mother , tells his former love interest Amelia that he is still in love with her , and finishes the script . It ends with Charlie in a voice @-@ over announcing the script is finished and that he wants Gérard Depardieu to portray him in the film .

Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script , but struggled with the adaptation and writer 's block . Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation , exaggerating events , and creating a fictional brother named Donald Kaufman . Kaufman put Donald Kaufman 's name on the script and dedicated the film to the fictional character . By September 1999 , Kaufman had written two drafts of the script ; he turned in a third draft in November 2000 . 
 Kaufman explained , 
 The idea of how to write the film didn 't come to me until quite late . It was the only idea I had , I liked it , and I knew there was no way it would be approved if I pitched it . So I just wrote it and never told the people I was writing it for . I only told Spike Jonze , as we were making Being John Malkovich and he saw how frustrated I was . Had he said I was crazy , I don 't know what I would have done . 
 In addition Kaufman stated , " I really thought I was ending my career by turning that in ! " 
 Adaptation went on fast track in April 2000 , with Kaufman making some revisions . Scott Brake of IGN gave the script a positive review in June 2000 , as did Drew " Moriarty " McWeeny of Ain 't It Cool News in October . Columbia Pictures committed to North America distribution only after Intermedia came aboard to finance the film in exchange for international distribution rights . Filming started in late March 2001 in Los Angeles , and finished by June . The " evolution " fantasy sequence was created by Digital Domain , while Skywalker Sound was responsible for the audio mixing of Adaptation . The makeup effects ( the Nicolas Cage double , Chris Cooper 's teeth , and the alligator attack ) were the handiwork of Makeup Effects Designer Tony Gardner ( designer ) , and his effects company Alterian , Inc .

" On Metacritic , the film holds a score of 83 out of 100 , based on 40 reviews , indicating " universal acclaim . " 
 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film a perfect four star rating , believing that the film " leaves you breathless with curiosity , as it teases itself with the directions it might take . To watch the film is to be actively involved in the challenge of its creation . " He later added the film to his " Great Movies " collection . At the end of 2009 , Ebert named the film one of the best of the decade . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film a four star rating , and praised Kaufman 's writing , stating " Screenwriting this smart , inventive , passionate and rip @-@ roaringly funny is a rare species . So all praise to Charlie Kaufman , working with director Spike Jonze to create the most original and outrageous film comedy since the two first teamed on Being John Malkovich , in 1999 . " Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote , " This is epic , funny , tragic , demanding , strange , original , boldly sincere filmmaking . And the climax , the portion that either sinks the entire movie or self @-@ critically explains how so many others derail , is bananas . " David Ansen of Newsweek felt Meryl Streep had not " been this much fun to watch in years " , while Mike Clark of USA Today gave a largely negative review , mainly criticizing the ending : " Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .

 = Wilhelmina FitzClarence , Countess of Munster = 
 Wilhelmina FitzClarence , Countess of Munster ( née Kennedy @-@ Erskine ; 27 June 1830 – 9 October 1906 ) was a British peeress and novelist . Her mother , Lady Augusta FitzClarence , was an illegitimate daughter of William IV of the United Kingdom ; Wilhelmina , also known as Mina , was born the day after William 's succession as monarch . She travelled as a young girl throughout Europe , visiting the courts of France and Hanover . In 1855 , Mina married her first cousin William FitzClarence , 2nd Earl of Munster ; they would have nine children , including the 3rd and 4th Earls of Munster . 
 The Earl and Countess of Munster lived at Palmeira Square in Brighton . Later in life , Lady Munster became a novelist and short story writer . In 1889 , she released her first novel , Dorinda ; a second , A Scotch Earl , followed two years later . The year 1896 saw the publication of Ghostly Tales , a collection of tales on the supernatural which have largely been forgotten today . Lady Munster also produced an autobiography entitled My Memories and Miscellanies , which was released in 1904 . She died two years later . 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 Wilhelmina " Mina " Kennedy @-@ Erskine was born on 27 June 1830 in Dun House , Montrose , Scotland . She was the second child of the Hon. John Kennedy @-@ Erskine and his wife Lady Augusta FitzClarence , an illegitimate daughter of William IV ( who became monarch the day before Mina 's birth ) . Her father , the second son of the 13th Earl of <unk> , was a captain with the 16th Lancers and an equerry to King William before dying in 1831 at the age of 28 . Her paternal grandmother , Anne Watts , was a descendant of the Schuyler family , the Van Cortlandt family ( including Stephanus Van Cortlandt ) , and the Delancey family of British North America . 
 Mina lived with her widowed mother and two siblings in a " charming brick house " on the River Thames called <unk> , which was next door to a house owned by her paternal grandparents . King William visited the family often and was quite fond of Mina ; on one occasion , he visited to comfort his daughter when three- or four @-@ year @-@ old Mina nearly died of a " very dangerous brain fever " . The Kennedy @-@ <unk> also often visited Windsor Castle during the king 's reign . 
 Five years after Kennedy @-@ Erskine 's death , Lady Augusta married Lord Frederick Gordon @-@ <unk> , a decision that displeased her first husband 's parents . The decision led to Lady Augusta 's departure from <unk> . In 1837 she became State Housekeeper at Kensington Palace after the death of her sister , Lady De L 'Isle . Mina lived there until she married . She and her sister Millicent enjoyed music and had a particular love for the Italian soprano Marietta Alboni . The sisters ' Italian singing @-@ master secretly arranged for a meeting with Alboni , but the encounter did not go well ; the singer discovered that they were the daughters of the " housekeeper " , and , assuming that they were not ladies , departed soon after . 
 In the late 1840s , Mina travelled through Europe with her family so that they might " learn languages and finish [ their ] education " . The trip started in 1847 , when Mina journeyed to Dresden due to her mother 's desire for her daughters to learn German . From 1847 to 1849 , she and her family lived in Paris near the Arc de Triomphe , and were kindly received by the French Royal Family headed by Louis Philippe I and Queen Marie Amalie . They left soon after the king and queen 's fall from power , as the city had suddenly become unsafe for those of their rank . In 1850 , they visited the court of Hanover and were received by Ernest Augustus I of Hanover and his family ; later that year , they returned to Kensington Palace and Mina and Millicent came out in society . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 Mina married her full first cousin William FitzClarence , 2nd Earl of Munster at Wemyss Castle on 17 April 1855 in a double wedding in which her sister Millicent married James Hay Erskine Wemyss . Like Mina , FitzClarence was a grandchild of William IV ; at a young age , he had succeeded his father the 1st Earl , who served as a governor of Windsor Castle and constable of the Round Tower until his suicide in 1842 . The <unk> travelled to Hamburg immediately after the wedding , visiting local <unk> and the family of Prince Christian of Schleswig @-@ Holstein ( who later married The Princess Helena ) . Their first child , Edward , was born within a year . The couple would have nine children , four of whom outlived their mother : 
 Edward , Viscount FitzClarence ( 29 March 1856 – 1870 ) 
 Hon. Lionel Frederick Archibald ( 24 July 1857 – 24 March 1863 ) 
 Geoffrey FitzClarence , 3rd Earl of Munster ( 18 July 1859 – 2 February 1902 ) ; died without issue 
 Hon. Arthur Falkland Manners ( 18 October 1860 – 1861 ) 
 Aubrey FitzClarence , 4th Earl of Munster ( 7 June 1862 – 1 January 1928 ) ; died without issue 
 Hon. William George ( 17 September 1864 – 4 October 1899 ) ; married Charlotte Elizabeth Williams 
 Hon. Harold Edward ( 15 November 1870 – 28 August 1926 ) ; married Frances Isabel Eleanor Keppel ; their son was the 5th Earl of Munster 
 Lady Lillian Adelaide Katherine Mary ( 10 December 1873 – 15 July 1948 ) ; married Captain William Arthur Boyd 
 Lady Dorothea Augusta ( 5 May 1876 – 1942 ) ; married Major Chandos Brydges Lee @-@ Warner 
 The Earl and Countess of Munster lived at Palmeira Square in Brighton . According to an article in contemporary women 's magazine The Lady 's Realm , the Countess lived a very quiet life . In 1897 , the magazine reported that she had lived in retirement in Brighton for the past thirty @-@ five years . Her attachment to the city , the article suggested , was due to childhood memories of visiting there with King William . The article also stated that because Lord Munster 's health was failing , the Countess was living in " comparative seclusion " , though her lifestyle was also attributed to a love of a " quiet , literary , and artistic life " . She died on 9 October 1906 , having been widowed five years . 
 = = Literary career = = 
 Later in life , Lady Munster became a novelist and short story writer , writing under the title the Countess of Munster . At the age of nearly sixty , she published two novels ; her first , Dorinda , in 1889 , and her second , A Scotch Earl , in 1891 . The plot of Dorinda centred on a young woman who eventually kills herself after stealing works of art from her friends . Oscar Wilde noted Munster 's skill in writing Dorinda ; he compared the " exceedingly clever " novel 's eponymous heroine to " a sort of well @-@ born " Becky Sharp , and praised the author 's ability " to draw ... in a few sentences the most lifelike portraits of social types and social exceptions " . In 1888 , an article by Munster about ballad singing appeared in The Woman 's World , a Victorian women 's magazine edited by Wilde . A Scotch Earl , which centred on a vulgar Scottish nobleman named Lord Invergordon , was less well received by contemporaries . The Spectator published a critical review soon after its publication which suggested that the novel 's showering of " contempt upon the society of wealth and rank " was close to Republicanism or Socialism . The review criticised A Scotch Earl for lacking " any merits of construction or style " , and added that Lady Munster was " not and never will be a capable novelist " . 
 In 1896 , Munster released Ghostly Tales , a collection of stories " written in a manner similar to accounts of true hauntings " . Lady 's Realm considered her stories to be based on fact . A positive review of Ghostly Tales was published in the Saturday Review in 1897 , in which the stories were described as " entertaining and dramatic " , but it was noted that not all were based on supernatural events . Hugh Lamb included the Countess 's " surprisingly grim " story " The Tyburn Ghost " in his 1979 edited volume Tales from a Gas @-@ Lit Graveyard . He wrote at the time that Lady Munster 's works had been " completely overlooked by bibliophiles and anthologists since her death " . Lamb deemed this regrettable , as he considered Ghostly Tales " possibly her best work " and one of the " truly representative collections of Victorian ghost stories " . Lamb also included another of her stories , " The Page @-@ Boy 's Ghost " , in a 1988 anthology . However , modern author and editor Douglas A. Anderson has called the Countess 's stories " standard , melodramatic fare " , which are " perfectly forgettable " . 
 In 1904 , Lady Munster produced an autobiography entitled My Memories and Miscellanies . In its foreword , she explained that " some valued friends " convinced her to write it , despite her reluctance , because her " long life " had witnessed " not a few interesting events " . The book was called her " chief work " in The Manchester Guardian at the time of her death in 1906 . The Countess wrote the entire book by memory , and expressed regret that she had given up her journal writing as a young girl after someone else improperly read it . The autobiography included several recounted sightings of the female ghost " Green Jean " at Wemyss Castle ; Lady Munster claimed that several members of her family , including Millicent , saw the ghost while staying there .

 = Asexuality = 
 Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction to anyone , or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity . It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation , or one of the variations thereof , alongside heterosexuality , homosexuality and bisexuality . It may also be an umbrella term used to categorize a broader spectrum of various asexual sub @-@ identities . A study in 2004 placed the prevalence of asexuality at 1 % in the British population . 
 Asexuality is distinct from abstention from sexual activity and from celibacy , which are behavioral and generally motivated by factors such as an individual 's personal or religious beliefs . Sexual orientation , unlike sexual behavior , is believed to be " enduring " . Some asexual people engage in sexual activity despite lacking sexual attraction or a desire for sex , due to a variety of reasons , such as a desire to pleasure themselves or romantic partners , or a desire to have children . 
 Acceptance of asexuality as a sexual orientation and field of scientific research is still relatively new , as a growing body of research from both sociological and psychological perspectives has begun to develop . While some researchers assert that asexuality is a sexual orientation , other researchers disagree . 
 Various asexual communities have started to form since the advent of the World Wide Web and social media . The most prolific and well @-@ known of these communities is the Asexual Visibility and Education Network ( AVEN ) , which was founded in 2001 by David Jay . 
 = = Definition , identity and relationships = = 
 Asexuality is sometimes referred to as " ace " or " the ace community " by researchers or asexual and LGBT people . Because there is significant variation among people who identify as asexual , asexuality can encompass broad definitions . Researchers generally define asexuality as the lack of sexual attraction or the lack of sexual interest , but their definitions vary ; they may use the term " to refer to individuals with low or absent sexual desire or attractions , low or absent sexual behaviors , exclusively romantic non @-@ sexual partnerships , or a combination of both absent sexual desires and behaviors . " 
 The Asexual Visibility and Education Network ( AVEN ) defines an asexual as " someone who does not experience sexual attraction " and stated , " [ a ] nother small minority will think of themselves as asexual for a brief period of time while exploring and questioning their own sexuality " and that " [ t ] here is no litmus test to determine if someone is asexual . Asexuality is like any other identity – at its core , it 's just a word that people use to help figure themselves out . If at any point someone finds the word asexual useful to describe themselves , we encourage them to use it for as long as it makes sense to do so . " 
 Asexual people , though lacking sexual attraction to any gender , might engage in purely romantic relationships , while others might not . There are asexual @-@ identified individuals who report that they feel sexual attraction but not the inclination to act on it because they have no true desire or need to engage in sexual or non @-@ sexual activity ( cuddling , hand @-@ holding , etc . ) , while other asexuals engage in cuddling or other non @-@ sexual physical activity . Some asexuals participate in sexual activity out of curiosity . Some may masturbate as a solitary form of release , while others do not feel a need to do so . 
 With regard to sexual activity in particular , the need or desire for masturbation is commonly referred to as sex drive by asexuals and they disassociate it from sexual attraction and being sexual ; asexuals who masturbate generally consider it to be a normal product of the human body and not a sign of latent sexuality , and may not even find it pleasurable . Some asexual men are unable to get an erection and sexual activity by attempting penetration is impossible for them . <unk> also differ in their feelings toward performing sex acts : some are indifferent and may have sex for the benefit of a romantic partner ; others are more strongly averse to the idea , though they do not typically dislike people for having sex . 
 Concerning romantic or emotional aspects of sexual orientation or sexual identity , asexuals may identify as heterosexual , lesbian , gay , bisexual , queer , or by the following terms to indicate that they associate with the romantic , rather than sexual , aspects of sexual orientation : 
 aromantic ; lack of romantic attraction towards anyone 
 <unk> ; as opposed to bisexual 
 <unk> ; as opposed to heterosexual 
 <unk> ; as opposed to homosexual 
 <unk> ; as opposed to pansexual 
 People may also identify as a gray @-@ A ( such as a gray @-@ romantic , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ) because they feel that they are between being aromantic and non @-@ aromantic , or between asexuality and sexual attraction . While the term gray @-@ A may cover anyone who occasionally feels romantic or sexual attraction , <unk> or <unk> experience sexual attraction only as a secondary component , feeling sexual attraction once a reasonably stable or large emotional connection has been created . 
 = = Research = = 
 = = = Prevalence = = = 
 Asexuality is not a new aspect of human sexuality , but it is relatively new to public discourse . SE Smith of The Guardian is not sure asexuality has actually increased , rather leaning towards the belief that it is simply more visible . In the mid @-@ twentieth century , Alfred Kinsey rated individuals from 0 to 6 according to their sexual orientation from heterosexual to homosexual , known as the Kinsey scale . He also included a category he called " X " for individuals with " no socio @-@ sexual contacts or reactions " ; in modern times , this is categorized as representing asexuality . Kinsey labeled 1 @.@ 5 % of the adult male population as X. In his second book , Sexual Behavior in the Human Female , he reported this breakdown of individuals who are X : unmarried females 
 = 14 – 19 % , married females = 
 1 – 3 % , previously married females 
 = 5 – 8 % , unmarried males = 
 3 – 4 % , married males 
 = 0 % , and previously married males = 
 1 – 2 % . 
 Further empirical data about an asexual demographic appeared in 1994 , when a research team in the United Kingdom carried out a comprehensive survey of 18 @,@ 876 British residents , spurred by the need for sexual information in the wake of the AIDS pandemic . The survey included a question on sexual attraction , to which 1 @.@ 05 % of the respondents replied that they had " never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all " . The study of this phenomenon was continued by the Canadian sexuality researcher Anthony Bogaert in 2004 , who explored the asexual demographic in a series of studies . Bogaert believed that the 1 % figure was not an accurate reflection of the likely much larger percentage of the population that could be identified as asexual , noting that 30 % of people contacted for the initial survey chose not to participate in the survey . Since less sexually experienced people are more likely to refuse to participate in studies about sexuality , and asexuals tend to be less sexually experienced than <unk> , it is likely that asexuals were under @-@ represented in the responding participants . The same study found the number of homosexuals and bisexuals combined to be about 1 @.@ 1 % of the population , which is much smaller than other studies indicate . 
 In contrast to Bogaert 's suggestion in 2004 of a higher percentage , a study by <unk> et al . , published in 2013 , suggests that , based on Natsal @-@ 2 data from 2000 @-@ 2001 , the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0 @.@ 4 % for people between the ages of 16 @-@ 44 . This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0 @.@ 9 % figure determined from the Natsal @-@ 1 data collected on the same age @-@ range a decade earlier . Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal @-@ 1 and Natsal @-@ 2 data . <unk> , Mercer , and Cassell also found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction ; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction . Muslims were also more likely to report this lack of attraction than respondents from Christian religions . 
 = = = Sexual orientation , mental health and etiology = = = 
 There is significant debate over whether or not asexuality is a sexual orientation . It has been compared and equated with hypoactive sexual desire disorder ( HSDD ) , in that both imply a general lack of sexual attraction to anyone ; HSDD has been used to <unk> asexuality , but asexuality is generally not considered a disorder or a sexual dysfunction ( such as anorgasmia , anhedonia , etc . ) , because it does not necessarily define someone as having a medical problem or problems relating to others socially . Unlike people with HSDD , asexual people normally do not experience " marked distress " and " interpersonal difficulty " concerning feelings about their sexuality , or generally a lack of sexual arousal ; asexuality is considered the lack or absence of sexual attraction as a life @-@ enduring characteristic . One study found that , compared to HSDD subjects , asexuals reported lower levels of sexual desire , sexual experience , sex @-@ related distress and depressive symptoms . Researchers Richards and Barker report that asexuals do not have disproportionate rates of alexithymia , depression , or personality disorders . Some people , however , may identify as asexual even if their non @-@ sexual state is explained by one or more of the aforementioned disorders . 
 The first study that gave empirical data about asexuals was published in 1983 by Paula Nurius , concerning the relationship between sexual orientation and mental health . 689 subjects — most of whom were students at various universities in the United States taking psychology or sociology classes — were given several surveys , including four clinical well @-@ being scales . Results showed that asexuals were more likely to have low self @-@ esteem and more likely to be depressed than members of other sexual orientations ; 25 @.@ 88 % of heterosexuals , 26 @.@ 54 % bisexuals ( called " <unk> " ) , 29 @.@ 88 % of homosexuals , and 33 @.@ 57 % of asexuals were reported to have problems with self @-@ esteem . A similar trend existed for depression . Nurius did not believe that firm conclusions can be drawn from this for a variety of reasons . 
 In a 2013 study , Yule et al. looked into mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals , homosexuals , bisexuals , and asexuals . The results of 203 male and 603 female participants were included in the findings . Yule et al. found that asexual male participants were more likely to report having a mood disorder than other males , particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants . The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts ; however , non @-@ asexual , non @-@ heterosexual females had the highest rates . Asexual participants of both sexes were more likely to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non @-@ heterosexual participants , as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings . Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors . 
 With regard to sexual orientation categories , asexuality may be argued as not being a meaningful category to add to the continuum , and instead argued as the lack of a sexual orientation or sexuality . Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one 's natural sexuality , and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality , anxiety or sexual abuse , sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner . Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics , asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category . 
 The suggestion that asexuality is a sexual dysfunction is controversial among the asexual community . Those who identify as asexual usually prefer it to be recognized as a sexual orientation . Various scholars state that asexuality is a sexual orientation , as some asexuals are unable to masturbate even though they reportedly have a normal sex drive , and that there are variations of sexual preferences , arguing that asexuality ought to be included as well . They state that asexuals do not choose to have no sexual desire , and generally start to find out their differences in sexual behaviors around adolescence . Because of these facts coming to light , it is argued that asexuality is much more than a behavioral choice , and is not something that can be cured like a disorder . 
 Etiology in this context is without implication of disease , disorder , or abnormality . Research on the etiology of sexual orientation when applied to asexuality has the definitional problem of sexual orientation not consistently being defined by researchers as including asexuality . Sexual orientation is defined as " enduring " and resistant to change , proving to be generally impervious to interventions intended to change it . While heterosexuality , homosexuality and bisexuality are usually , but not always , determined during the early years of preadolescent life , it is not known when asexuality is determined . " It is unclear whether these characteristics [ viz . , " lacking interest in or desire for sex " ] are thought to be lifelong , or if they may be acquired . " Some studies have suggested that asexuality is linked to biological factors that are determined <unk> or in early childhood . These studies report that asexuals are shorter on average , more likely to be non @-@ right @-@ handed , and have more older brothers ( known as the fraternal birth order effect ) . <unk> with handedness and birth order have also been reported for male homosexuality , possibly indicating that it has a similar origin . 
 Non @-@ measurement in some areas of sexual orientation is accepted by the American Psychological Association , the American Psychiatric Association , and the National Association of Social Workers : " [ S ] imply to document that a phenomenon occurs , case studies and non @-@ probability samples are often adequate ... Some groups are sufficiently few in number – relative to the entire population – that locating them with probability sampling is extremely expensive or practically impossible . In the latter cases , the use of non @-@ probability samples is often appropriate . " In determining etiologies , when asexuals are a small percentage of a large society , asexuals with a given etiology will compose an even smaller percentage , so that etiological information is available only from some individuals , generally not randomly selected . 
 = = = Sexual activity and sexuality = = = 
 While some asexuals masturbate as a solitary form of release or have sex for the benefit of a romantic partner , others do not ( see above ) . The Kinsey Institute sponsored another small survey on the topic in 2007 , which found that self @-@ identified asexuals " reported significantly less desire for sex with a partner , lower sexual <unk> , and lower sexual excitation but did not differ consistently from non @-@ asexuals in their sexual inhibition scores or their desire to masturbate " . 
 A 1977 paper titled Asexual and <unk> Women : Two Invisible Groups , by Myra T. Johnson , may be the first paper explicitly devoted to asexuality in humans . Johnson defines asexuals as those men and women " who , regardless of physical or emotional condition , actual sexual history , and marital status or ideological orientation , seem to prefer not to engage in sexual activity . " She contrasts autoerotic women with asexual women : " The asexual woman ... has no sexual desires at all [ but ] the autoerotic woman ... recognizes such desires but prefers to satisfy them alone . " Johnson 's evidence is mostly letters to the editor found in women 's magazines written by asexual / autoerotic women . She portrays them as invisible , " oppressed by a consensus that they are nonexistent , " and left behind by both the sexual revolution and the feminist movement . Society either ignores or denies their existence or insists they must be ascetic for religious reasons , neurotic , or asexual for political reasons . 
 In a study published in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect , vol . 5 , and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale . Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism , Storms only used fantasizing and eroticism . Storms , however , placed hetero @-@ eroticism and homo @-@ eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale ; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality ( exhibiting both <unk> and homo @-@ eroticism in degrees comparable to <unk> or homosexuals , respectively ) and asexuality ( exhibiting a level of homo @-@ eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero @-@ eroticism comparable to a homosexual , namely , little to none ) . Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey 's model could be mis @-@ categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual , because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners . 
 In a 1983 study by Paula Nurius , which included 689 subjects ( most of whom were students at various universities in the United States taking psychology or sociology classes ) , the two @-@ dimensional fantasizing and eroticism scale was used to measure sexual orientation . Based on the results , respondents were given a score ranging from 0 to 100 for hetero @-@ eroticism and from 0 to 100 for homo @-@ eroticism . Respondents who scored lower than 10 on both were labeled " asexual . " This consisted of 5 % of the males and 10 % of the females . Results showed that asexuals reported much lower frequency and desired frequency of a variety of sexual activities including having multiple partners , anal sexual activities , having sexual encounters in a variety of locations , and autoerotic activities . 
 In some other sexually reproducing species , a portion of animals exhibit no sexual interest in either sex , and could be considered asexual . Rodent studies use the label duds for rodents which express no sexual interest . A series of studies on ram mating preferences found that 12 @.@ 5 % showed no interest in mating with either sex ; the researchers termed these animals asexual . The asexual rams did not differ from sexual rams in measured hormone levels .

 A 2010 paper written by <unk> June Cerankowski and Megan Milks , titled New Orientations : Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice , suggests that asexuality may be somewhat of a question in itself for the studies of gender and sexuality . Cerankowski and Milks have suggested that asexuality raises many more questions than it resolves , such as how a person could abstain from having sex , which is generally accepted by society to be the most basic of instincts . The article also states that society has deemed " [ LGBT and ] female sexuality as empowered or repressed . The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenets of pro @-@ sex feminism [ in which it is ] already defined as repressive or anti @-@ sex sexualities . " In addition to accepting self @-@ identification as asexual , the Asexual Visibility and Education Network has formulated asexuality as a biologically @-@ determined orientation . This formula , if dissected scientifically and proven , would support researcher Simon <unk> 's blind study of the hypothalamus in gay men , women , and straight men , which indicates that there is a biological difference between straight men and gay men . 
 In 2014 , Cerankowski and Milks edited and published <unk> : Feminist and Queer Perspectives , a collection of essays intended to explore the politics of asexuality from a feminist and queer perspective . It is broken into the introduction and then six parts : Theorizing Asexuality : New Orientations ; The Politics of Asexuality ; Visualizing Asexuality in Media Culture ; Asexuality and Masculinity ; Health , Disability , and <unk> ; and Reading <unk> : Asexual Literary Theory . Each part contains two to three papers on a given aspect of asexuality research . One such paper is written by Ela Przybylo , another name that is becoming common in asexual scholarly literature . Her article , with regard to the Cerankowski and Milks anthology , focuses on accounts by self @-@ identified male asexuals , with a particular focus on the pressures men experience towards having sex in dominant Western discourse and media . Three men living in Southern Ontario , Canada , were interviewed in 2011 , and Przybylo admits that the small sample @-@ size means that her findings cannot be generalized to a greater population in terms of representation , and that they are " exploratory and provisional , " especially in a field that is still lacking in <unk> . All three interviewees addressed being affected by the stereotype that men have to enjoy and want sex in order to be " real men . " 
 Another of Przybylo 's articles , Asexuality and the feminist politics of ' not doing it ' , was published in 2011 , and takes a feminist lens to scientific writings on asexuality . She argues that asexuality is made possible only through the Western context of " sexual , coital , and heterosexual imperatives " . She addresses earlier works by Dana Densmore , Valerie Solanas , and Breanne Fahs , who argued for " asexuality and celibacy " as radical feminist political strategies against patriarchy . While Przybylo does make some distinctions between asexuality and celibacy , she considers blurring the lines between the two to be productive for a feminist understanding of the topic . In 2013 , " Producing Facts : Empirical Asexuality and the Scientific Study of Sex . " was published in Feminism & Psychology . In it , Przybylo distinguishes between two different stages of asexual research - that of the late 1970s to the early 1990s , which often included a very limited understanding of asexuality , and the more recent revisiting of the subject which she says began with Bogaert 's 2004 study ( see above ) and has popularized the subject and made it more " culturally visible " . In this article , Przybylo once again asserts the understanding of asexuality as a cultural phenomenon , and continues to be critical of its scientific study . 
 CJ <unk> Chasin states in Reconsidering Asexuality and Its Radical Potential that academic research on asexuality " has positioned asexuality in line with essentialist discourses of sexual orientation " which is troublesome as it creates a binary between asexuals and persons who have been subjected to psychiatric intervention for disorders such as <unk> Sexual Desire Disorder . Chasin says that this binary implies that all asexuals experience a lifelong ( hence , enduring ) lack of sexual attraction , that all non @-@ asexuals who experience a lack of sexual desire experience distress over it , and that it <unk> asexuals who do experience such distress . As Chasin says such diagnoses as HSDD act to <unk> and govern women 's sexuality , the article aims to " unpack " problematic definitions of asexuality that are harmful to both asexuals and women alike . Chasin states that asexuality has the power to challenge commonplace discourse of the naturalness of sexuality , but that the unquestioned acceptance of its current definition does not allow for this . Chasin also argues there and elsewhere in Making Sense in and of the Asexual Community : Navigating Relationships and Identities in a Context of Resistance that is important to interrogate why someone might be distressed about low sexual desire . Chasin further argues that clinicians have an ethical obligation to avoid treating low sexual desire per se as pathological , and to discuss asexuality as a viable possibility ( where relevant ) with clients presenting clinically with low sexual desire . 
 = = = Bogaert 's psychological work and theories = = = 
 In a 2015 volume of The Journal of Sex Research , Bogaert argued that understanding asexuality is of key importance to understanding sexuality in general . For his work , Bogaert defines asexuality as " a lack of lustful inclinations / feelings directed toward others , " a definition that he argues is relatively new in light of recent theory and empirical work on sexual orientation . This definition of asexuality also makes clear this distinction between behavior and desire , for both asexuality and celibacy , although Bogaert also notes that there is some evidence of reduced sexual activity for those who fit this definition . He further distinguishes between desire for others and desire for sexual stimulation , the latter of which is not always absent for those who identify as asexual , although he acknowledges that other theorists define asexuality differently and that further research needs to be done on the " complex relationship between attraction and desire " . Another distinction is made between romantic and sexual attraction , and he draws on work from developmental psychology , which suggests that romantic systems derive from attachment theory while sexual systems " primarily reside in different brain structures " . 
 Concurrent with Bogaert 's suggestion that understanding asexuality will lead to a better understanding of sexuality overall , he discusses the topic of asexual masturbation to theorize on asexuals and " ' target @-@ oriented ' <unk> , in which there is an inversion , reversal , or disconnection between the self and the typical target / object of sexual interest / attraction " ( such as attraction to oneself , labelled " <unk> " ) . 
 In an earlier 2006 article , Bogaert acknowledges that a distinction between behavior and attraction has been accepted into recent conceptualizations of sexual orientation , which aids in positioning asexuality as such . He adds that , by this framework , " ( subjective ) sexual attraction is the psychological core of sexual orientation " , and also addresses that there may be " some skepticism in [ both ] the academic and clinical communities " about classifying asexuality as a sexual orientation , and that it raises two objections to such a classification : First , he suggests that there could be an issue with self @-@ reporting ( i.e. , " a ' perceived ' or ' reported ' lack of attraction , " particularly for definitions of sexual orientation that consider physical arousal over subjective attraction ) , and , second , he raises the issue of overlap between absent and very low sexual desire , as those with an extremely low desire may still have an " underlying sexual orientation " despite potentially identifying as asexual . 
 = = Community = = 
 A community of self @-@ identified asexuals coalesced in the early 21st century , aided by the popularity of online communities . Elizabeth Abbott , author of A History of Celibacy , acknowledges a difference between asexuality and celibacy , and posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population but that asexual people kept a low profile . While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as " an insult to the sacrament of marriage " in medieval Europe , and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void , asexuality , unlike homosexuality , has never been illegal , and asexual people have usually been able to " fly under the radar " . However , in the 21st century , the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of a community built around a common asexual identity . 
 The Asexual Visibility and Education Network ( AVEN ) is an organization founded by American asexuality activist David Jay in 2001 that focuses on asexuality issues . Its stated goals are " creating public acceptance and discussion of asexuality and facilitating the growth of an asexual community " . Communities such as AVEN can be beneficial to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity with regard to their possible asexuality . Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community . They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society . This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable , and possible reasons for why they feel this way . Pathological beliefs tend to follow , in which , in some cases , they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease . Self @-@ understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings . Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self @-@ clarification to identifying on a communal level , which can be empowering , because they now have something to associate with , which gives normality to this overall socially @-@ isolating situation . 
 At this time , asexual organizations and other Internet resources play a key role in informing people about asexuality . The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation . Like with any sexual orientation , most people who are asexual are self @-@ identified . This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality . There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality , which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population ; however , due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject , what these groups promote as information is often questioned . 
 On June 29 , 2014 , AVEN organised the second International Asexuality Conference , as an affiliate <unk> event in Toronto . The event , which was attended by around 250 people , was the largest gathering of asexuals to date . The conference included presentations , discussions , and workshops on topics such as research on asexuality , asexual relationships , and intersecting identities . 
 = = = Symbols = = = 
 In 2009 , AVEN members participated in the first asexual entry into an American pride parade when they walked in the San Francisco Pride Parade . In August 2010 , after a period of debate over having an asexual flag and how to set up a system to create one , and contacting as many asexual communities as possible , a flag was announced as the asexual pride flag by one of the teams involved . The final flag had been a popular candidate and had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN . The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized . The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in articles about the sexuality . 
 = = Discrimination and legal protections = = 
 A 2012 study published in Group Processes & Intergroup Relations reports there is more prejudice , dehumanization and discrimination toward asexuals than toward other sexual minorities , such as gay men , lesbians and bisexuals . Both homosexual and heterosexual people thought of asexuals as not only cold , but also animalistic and unrestrained . Asexual activist , author , and blogger Julie Decker has observed that sexual harassment and violence , such as corrective rape , commonly <unk> the asexual community . However , a different study found little evidence of serious discrimination against asexuals because of their asexuality . Sociologist Mark <unk> sees a middle ground , claiming that while asexuals do often experience discrimination , it is not of a phobic nature but " more about marginalization because people genuinely don 't understand asexuality . " 
 <unk> also face prejudice from within the LGBT community . Upon coming out as asexual , activist Sara Beth Brooks was told by many LGBT people that asexuals are mistaken in their self @-@ identification and seek undeserved attention within the social justice movement . 
 In some jurisdictions , asexuals have legal protections . While Brazil bans since 1999 whatever <unk> or attempted treatment of sexual orientation by mental health professionals through the national ethical code , the U.S. state of New York has labeled asexuals as a protected class . However , asexuality does not typically attract the attention of the public or major scrutiny ; therefore , it has not been the subject of legislation as much as other sexual orientations have . 
 = = In the media = = 
 Asexual representation in the media is limited and rarely openly acknowledged or confirmed by creators or authors . Asexuality as a sexual identity , rather than as a biological entity , became more widely discussed in the media in the beginning of the 21st century . Before , sexuality in general was not questioned ; it was often assumed , and little research had been conducted , thus susceptible to social influence , including media portrayal . 
 = Charles R. Apted = 
 Charles Robert Apted ( June 18 , 1873 – June 5 , 1941 ) ‍ was for 39 years a Harvard University official in various capacities , for much of that time chief of the Harvard Yard police ( " Harvard Cop No. 1 " , the Boston Globe called him ) ‍ and su ­ per ­ in ­ tend ­ ent of Harvard buildings . His Boston Globe obituary called him " both feared and beloved by under ­ grad ­ u ­ <unk> during three university pres ­ i ­ den ­ <unk> administrations " . 
 He gained national prominence in 1915 , when he identified deranged former Harvard German instructor and wife @-@ poisoner Eric Muenter as the dynamite @-@ wielding intruder who had shot J. P. Morgan , Jr. and bombed the US Senate . 
 = = Background = = 
 Apted was born in Boston of English @-@ immigrant parents , and worked for a time in insurance . He married Eva C. Hunt on June 16 , 1898 . 
 He was elected to the Cambridge , Massachusetts " common council " in 1914 , and to the city council ( under a new city charter ) in 1915 or 1916 . In his first three years in office he was " chairman of every social event of the city council " , and was for many years grand chancellor of the Knights of Pythias . 
 = = Harvard career = = 
 He began at Harvard in 1902 as a clerk in the office of the Supervisor of <unk> . " Old Harvard grads remember him for the sympathetic help he gave some of the poorer students [ when ] he had charge of the Furniture Loan Department " , said The New York Times . By 1921 he was Supervisor of <unk> ( later Su ­ per ­ in ­ tend ­ ent of Buildings ) himself , and by his retirement in 1941 four hundred Harvard staff were under his supervision , including twenty @-@ two " yard cops " . 
 His duties included oversight of the Harvard Police Patrol . In this capacity he was " both guardian and disciplinarian " , keeping student misbehavior under control within Harvard 's confines — ​ ​ " His cry of ' Break it up ' as he headed for the focal point of any riot or disturbance became famous in the annals of the College " — ​ ​ and extricated his " boys " from trouble with authorities outside the school 's gates . " With police forces for miles around ' Charlie 's ' word was as good as bail " , according to the The Harvard Crimson . The " mild @-@ mannered , bespectacled " ‍ Apted also protected students in trouble — ​ ​ especially those from prominent families — ​ ​ from publicity ; in 1932 the City Council criticized him for refusing to reveal the names of participants in a riot , which had grown from the serenading of Radcliffe women to trash fires and an assault on a police station . 
 In 1933 it was into his hands that the so @-@ called Sacred Cod — ​ ​ the emblem of the Com ­ mon ­ wealth of Mas ­ sa ­ chu ­ setts " <unk> " days earlier from the Mas ­ sa ­ chu ­ setts State House — ​ ​ was delivered by two young men at a late @-@ night rendezvous , to which he had been directed by a mysterious telephone call . Following his " single @-@ handed recovery of the emblem ... after both city and state police had been baffled at every turn " , the Crimson reported that he had been " advanced to the rank of Colonel in the Yard Police " , adding that his rise been " meteoric . Ranked as Captain a year ago , he was advanced to the title of Major as a result of his work in the famous Memorial Hall clapper case last spring . " ( The " ranks " were unofficial , bestowed by the student body as a sign of affection . ) ‍ 
 When Harvard athletes were suspected in the March 1934 disappearance of Yale 's " ugly bulldog mascot " , Handsome Dan , Yale officials asked Apted to find the animal . He delivered it some days later to Yale 's New Haven , Connecticut campus , though not before the Lampoon took photographs of the canine licking the boots of the John Harvard statue , which had been smeared with hamburger . ( " Dog licks man " , a Crimson headline read . ) ‍ 
 More serious matters investigated by Apted , over the years , included Prohibition @-@ era bootlegging , illegal gambling , a rash of <unk> of donors ' portraits , death threats against Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell during his involvement in the Sacco @-@ Vanzetti case , and the theft of thousands of Harvard library books by a former graduate student . In an extortion racket smashed in 1938 , two " young and good looking " girls ( " one being a blonde and the other a redhead " ) lured their freshman victims to a Brighton , Mas ­ sa ­ chu ­ setts apartment , then demanded " financial assistance " in return for not alleging to Harvard officials that im ­ pro ­ pri ­ e ­ ties had ensued . 
 In 1915 a " Frank Holt " was subdued by a butler armed with a lump of coal after shooting financier J. P. Morgan , Jr. at Morgan 's Glen Cove , New York home . Dynamite was found in the assailant 's coat , and he quickly confessed to planting the bomb which had wrecked a United States Senate reception room the day before . Soon a tip was received in Cambridge pointing out a resemblance between " Holt " and Eric Muenter , a Harvard German instructor who had disappeared in 1906 after poisoning his pregnant wife with arsenic @-@ laced " beef tea " ; Apted ( who had lived near Muenter in Cambridge ) was dispatched to New York , where he identified Muenter , who soon after committed suicide . " The newspapers had a field day with Morgan , the Capitol , Harvard and murder all in one story , " the Crimson wrote years later . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Though not a Harvard graduate , Apted felt " as much like one as all the Lowells and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> together " , and was an honorary member of the class of 1906 after enrolling in two architecture courses that year . " The list of students with whom ' Charlie ' was acquainted reads like a Who 's Who , " said the Crimson . " Franklin Roosevelt , for instance , and ' all his damn kids . ' Then there is Leverett Saltonstall , Felix Frankfurter , Robert Benchley , Arthur Holcombe , Joe Kennedy , Archy Davison , and [ Harvard President ] ' Jim ' Conant " ‍ ( whom Apted once called " a good boy " ) . " The world would be surprised if they knew , as I do , the various stunts pulled at Harvard by some of the biggest men in the country , " he said . 
 A 1940 dinner in his honor — ​ ​ " in Harvard 's paneled old Memorial Hall [ at which ] 600 Harvard men dined and <unk> him [ and ] the Harvard Glee Club sang ' Behold the Lord High Executioner ' ‍ " ( though with Executioner changed to Protector ) ‍ — ​ ​ was reported in Time magazine 's Education section and The New York Times . Scheduled speakers included Mas ­ sa ­ chu ­ setts Governor Leverett Saltonstall , Attorney General Paul A. Dever , Harvard Presidents Conant and ( emeritus ) A. Lawrence Lowell , as well as a senator , two judges , and the mayor of Cambridge . 
 Apted died June 5 , 1941 . His front @-@ page Boston Globe obituary said , 
 Long after the memories of other college officials had dimmed into the past , Harvard men remembered " Col. " Apted . He was both feared and beloved by under ­ grad ­ u ­ <unk> during three university pres ­ i ­ den ­ <unk> ad ­ min ­ i ­ <unk> ­ tions , and he was the subject of more class day anecdotes , probably , than even such other traditional Harvard characters as <unk> .

 Erin Katrina McLeod ( born February 26 , 1983 ) is a Canadian soccer player , Olympic bronze medalist and visual artist . A veteran goalkeeper for the Canada women 's national soccer team , she also plays for FC Rosengård in the Damallsvenskan , the highest division of women 's football in Sweden . She first appeared for the Canada women 's national soccer team at the 2002 Algarve Cup and has since made 115 appearances for the team . In 2012 , as part of the Canadian Soccer Association 's Centennial Celebration , she was honoured on the All @-@ Time Canada XI women 's team . 
 McLeod has represented Canada in three FIFA Women 's World Cups : 2007 in China , 2011 in Germany and 2015 in Canada . She has played in two Olympic tournaments : 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London where she helped Canada win the bronze medal . Before joining FC Rosengård in 2015 , she played professional soccer for the Vancouver Whitecaps , Washington Freedom , Dalsjöfors GoIF , Chicago Red Stars , and Houston Dash . She played collegiate soccer for the Southern Methodist University Mustangs as well as the Penn State Nittany Lions where she set several all @-@ time records . 
 McLeod 's most notable and controversial appearance came during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London . In the semi @-@ final match against the United States on August 6 , the referee ruled that McLeod had broken the six @-@ second handling rule in the 76th minute , when Canada was leading 3 – 2 . A free kick was given to the United States which resulted in a penalty being called on Canadian player Marie @-@ Ève Nault after the ball struck her in the arm . The United States was given a penalty kick , which McLeod did not save . The United States ultimately won the game in overtime , eliminating Canada 's chance for the gold medal . 
 McLeod has suffered three ACL injuries to her right knee . The most recent occurred on March 23 , 2016 while playing for FC Rosengård and will keep her out of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born to Cheryl and Doug McLeod in St. Albert , Alberta , a city near Edmonton , Erin was raised with her younger sister , Cara , and older sister , Megan . As a young girl , McLeod fell in love with hockey and the Edmonton Oilers . At the age of five , her family moved to Calgary , where she channeled her obsession into soccer . She quickly climbed the local soccer ranks and found herself a midfielder on a Calgary select team . At the age of 12 , the goalkeeper on the team was injured and she stepped up for the spot . She has been a goalkeeper ever since . 
 McLeod 's father , Doug , was an oil engineer , a job that required him to move around frequently . In 1997 , when McLeod was 14 , she and her family moved to Jakarta , Indonesia , where she spent both grades 9 and 10 . While in Jakarta , McLeod captained the under @-@ 15 Jakarta all @-@ stars as the only girl on the team . She was able to greatly improve her game by playing with boys . Unfortunately , she grew too old for the all @-@ star team the following year and was left to play on the high school team with many girls who had never played soccer before . 
 During the May 1998 riots in Indonesia , McLeod , then 15 , and her family were forced to evacuate due to the impending danger . The main airport in Jakarta was too dangerous at the time and they were forced to fly out from a smaller airport , passing a long line of tanks on the way there . She noted that it " opened up [ her ] eyes to what 's going on in the world " and that she didn 't " know poverty like they do . " McLeod and her family eventually returned to their home in Indonesia , where she remained for another year . 
 While in Indonesia , McLeod was plagued by body image issues and developed an eating disorder . She was heavier than many girls at her high school , and would often skip meals and exercise more instead . Her family eventually hired a nutritionist to help . 
 In the summer of 1999 , before McLeod entered grade 11 , she made the decision to move back to Calgary to live with her grandmother , leaving her parents and younger sister behind in Jakarta . After making the move back to Canada , McLeod caught the attention of Canadian under @-@ 19 coach Ian Bridge and reached her dream of representing Canada on the international stage .

 It received extremely positive reviews at the time of its release and is retrospectively viewed as a cult classic and Revolution 's greatest game besides Broken Sword : The Shadow of the Templars . A remastered edition was released for iOS in 2009 ( as Beneath a Steel Sky Remastered ) , which also received a positive reception from the gaming press . A sequel was greenlit during the Broken Sword : The Serpent 's Curse 2012 Kickstarter campaign , but its development has yet to be confirmed . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D adventure game played from a third @-@ person perspective . The player uses a point @-@ and @-@ click interface to interact with the environment and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game 's world . To solve puzzles and progress in the game , the player collects items that may be combined with one another , used on the environment , or given to non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) . The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees to learn about the game 's puzzles and plot . Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment . Unlike in most adventure games at the time , the protagonist 's death is possible , after which the player starts from the last save point . In the remastered iOS version , the point @-@ and @-@ click interface is replaced with a touch user interface , a hint system is added , and hotspots are highlighted .

 = = = Background = = = 
 Beneath a Steel Sky is set at an unknown point in a dystopian future , when the Earth has been significantly damaged by pollution and / or nuclear fallout . 
 In Australia , the six states and two territories who have been consumed by their respective capital cities are described as " city states " . Union City is the second largest of the six remaining city states after the acquisition of Asio @-@ City . Within this socio @-@ political milieu , the national intelligence agency ASIO wield a great deal of power . 
 After the " Euro @-@ American War " , all participants agreed upon a set of ideals described as the " neo democratic principles " which remove all labour representation and social benefits . Ironically , those that subscribe to these principles are called " Unions " , contrasting the real world definition of what a trade union pushes for . Those that oppose the Unions ' ideals are called " Corporations " . All of the City States in Australia are either Corporations or Unions . 
 The larger political context of the game involves a conflict between Union City and the Hobart Corporation , whereby they are each trying to achieve market dominance by the use of sabotage . During the game , characters in Union City remark that Hobart Corporation is winning the " economic war " by flooding the market with " cheap , gimmicky garbage , " although it is never clarified whether this is mere propaganda . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The immediate backstory is introduced via a comic book that tells the story of a young boy called Robert who is the sole survivor of a helicopter crash in " the Gap " ( the name applied to the Outback at the time of the game ) . Too young to fend for himself , Robert is adopted by a group of locals , who teach him the skills he needs to survive in this harsh new environment ; they name him Robert Foster , partly due to him being fostered by them , but also because of the discovery of an empty can of Foster 's Lager found near the crash site . Over the years , Foster learns engineering and technology and builds a talking , sentient robot called Joey . Joey 's personality is stored on a small circuit board , which can easily be inserted and removed from many types of robot . This allows him to change bodies as the situation requires , provided his circuit board is not damaged . His commentaries on the current " shell " he is in are a running gag throughout the game . 
 As the game starts , Foster is kidnapped and his tribe annihilated by security soldiers sent from Union City by its all @-@ powerful computer , LINC ( Logical Inter @-@ Neural Connection ) . The abductors refuse to give Foster any explanation as to what is happening . Shortly upon arriving in the city , the helicopter malfunctions and crashes in the city 's upper level . Foster survives and flees , making his way into a recycling plant , carrying Joey 's circuit board with him . 
 Foster places Joey 's circuit board into a robotic vacuum cleaner ( something about which Joey is none too happy ) . He then attempts to escape the plant , but is cornered by a security officer who had also survived the accident . The officer , Reich , addresses Foster as " <unk> " . Just as Reich is about to kill Foster , a nearby security camera shoots a laser , disarming him . Reich tells the camera , which he reveals is controlled by LINC , that Foster must be stopped . In answer the camera shoots him again , killing him . Foster takes the officer 's access card and sunglasses before he continues his escape . 
 As he makes his way further down the city , Foster eventually arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels . There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially , to the point where he is now half @-@ machine , half @-@ organic entity . However , in order to function , LINC needs a human host to share its brain . The current host is Foster 's biological father , who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC . It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because , with the death of its current host inevitable , it needed a replacement , and only a blood relative would do . Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey ( now calling himself Ken ) into the mainframe . Joey / Ken is able to take control of the system , and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia . 
 = = Development = = 
 While working at Activision , Revolution co @-@ founder and CEO Charles Cecil got the idea of working with Dave Gibbons , artist and co @-@ creator of comic book Watchmen , as Cecil was a fan of the comic book himself . He approached Gibbons , but shortly thereafter , the old Activision broke down . However , they maintained a friendship , and Cecil later contacted Gibbons to ask him to work on Revolution 's second game . Seeing his son play video games , Gibbons became interested and realized that his skills in drawing , writing and conceptualizing could be useful in a gaming environment . Joining the team just before the release Lure of the Temptress , Gibbons was sent a rudimentary outline of what could happen in the hypothesised game , and wrote a longer story with new characters and scenarios , to which Revolution then further added . Originally the game was named Underworld , a title proposed by Gibbons , but it was renamed due to the release of Ultima Underworld : The Stygian Abyss . 
 The production values became much higher for Beneath a Steel Sky than for Lure of the Temptress , resulting in a game six times larger , and by the end of 1993 , the team working on the game had grown to eleven . The game was created in sections , which allowed the team to ensure that each part was " perfected " before moving on . Its 2 @-@ year development cost £ 40 @,@ 000 , a large amount of money for the company at the time . 
 = = = Creative and technical design = = = 
 The designers ' goal was to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics . Gibbons drew the backgrounds in pencil , starting with roughs , which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible . Once agreed upon , Gibbons would then make the final sketch . The pencil sketches were then colored , mainly by Les Pace . The backgrounds were scanned on a Macintosh as 24 @-@ bit , <unk> pixel images with 16 million colors , and then transformed to 8 @-@ bit , 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version . The backgrounds were designed so that the sprites would appear clear on the screen and wouldn 't mix with the backgrounds . Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint . Steve Ince , who joined the team in February 1993 , created a number of sprite animations , also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons 's sketches . Gibbons also designed the characters , although he found it challenging to get a character 's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette . He would have liked to design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback , but Revolution wanted something more detailed , so the result became a compromise . All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each . According to Gibbons , about 75 % of the backgrounds and characters he designed were used in the game . 
 Dave Cummins wrote the dialogue for the game . The tone of Revolution 's early games was born from a tension between Cummins and Cecil . Cummins wanted to be more flippant with dialogue , while Cecil wanted to be more serious . Their goal was to find the middle ground between Sierra 's " ridiculously earnest " stories and the slapstick comedy of LucasArts games . For the voice acting , which is only included in the CD @-@ ROM version , Revolution used actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company . Only two days were spent recording over five thousands lines of dialogue . Not pleased with the results , however , Revolution decided on a lengthy re @-@ recording , and realized that voice actors should be used , rather than stage actors . As a result of this , the speech doesn 't always match the on @-@ screen text , with English terms being Americanized . Cummins was also responsible for the score of the game , writing a specific tune for each of the main locations . 
 Beneath a Steel Sky became the second game to use Revolution 's Virtual Theatre engine , after Lure of the Temptress . According to Cecil , the original version of the engine seemed less applicable in Beneath a Steel Sky , as the ability to issue commands conflicted with the gameplay they intended to create . Lure of the Temptress had one story that was moved forward by a key event , whereas Beneath a Steel Sky had multiple threads . In one way this presented them with " exciting gameplay opportunities , but in others it cordoned off more ambitious ideas in terms of <unk> . " As a consequence , some of the engine 's features were scaled back . Tony Warriner and David Sykes , both Revolution co @-@ founders and programmers , had to update the engine , which was part of the new deal with Virgin Interactive . As an example of change in the updated engine , Virtual Theatre 2 @.@ 0 , Warriner explained that in Lure of the Temptress , the system controlled everything , for instance specific routines to a door . So if there was a door on @-@ screen , the door @-@ routine was called up to handle it . The consequence was that every door looked the same and acted the same , so if a door was somewhat different from the last one , it caused a problem . This was changed in the new system , as it was object oriented and no distinction was made between a proper object like a door or key .

 Beneath a Steel Sky was presented at the European Computer Trade Show in the London Business Design Centre in April 1993 and at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1993 . According to French magazine Génération 4 , the game was supposed to be released by the end of October 1993 . Various playable demos of the game were made ; one was added to the first issue of PC Gamer , and Amiga demos were added as cover disks to several Amiga magazines . 
 Beneath a Steel Sky was published in March 1994 by Virgin Interactive on floppy disks and CD @-@ ROM . It came on 15 floppy disks , as opposed to Lure of The Temptress , which came on four . Because of the Amiga restrictions , a few animations had to be left out , as not all Amiga owners had a hard drive . Each conversion of the images to the Amiga resulted in a loss of detail because of the Amiga 's limited palette and resolution . According to Revolution in @-@ house artist Adam Tween , it took a couple of days to " touch up " the screens . A comic book created by Gibbons , which was translated into the introduction sequence of the game , came as part of the game package . 
 Beneath a Steel Sky was translated from English into French and Portuguese . This was the first game not developed in Portugal to be released with a Portuguese translation . 
 = = = Freeware release and Remastered edition = = = 
 In August 2003 , the game was released as freeware with its assembly language source code by Revolution Software . The source code availability made it possible for the ScummVM project to support the game , which allows the game to be played on Windows , OS X , Linux , Windows CE and other compatible operating systems and platforms . 
 In November 2011 , James Woodcock released an enhanced soundtrack of the game for ScummVM . The game is also available for free download on digital distribution services , including <unk> and GOG.com. 
 In July 2009 , Revolution announced that a remastered edition of Beneath a Steel Sky would be released on iOS later that year . The remastered edition features new animated movies by Gibbons , a context @-@ sensitive help system and improved audio quality . The game was released on the App Store on October 7 , 2009 . The animated movies in the iOS remastered version make use of the original stills and use a sliding paper @-@ like style to animate them . 
 = = Critical reception and commercial performance = = 
 Beneath a Steel Sky was critically acclaimed . In 1995 , PC Gamer awarded it the " Best Dialogue " award , and it won the " Best Adventure " award at the Golden Joystick Awards . It was also a commercial success , reaching the number one place on the British Gallup charts . 
 CU Amiga 's Tony Dillon proclaimed Beneath a Steel Sky as " one of the greatest adventures ever . " Amiga Format 's Rob Mead said that the game is an " Utterly brilliant " , " massive , intense and atmospheric adventure which will keep you on tenterhooks right until its final startling conclusion . " PC Gamer US 's Steve Poole called it " slick , funny , " " absorbing " and " one of the most playable adventures of all time " " that will appeal to a wide variety of gamers " . Amiga Power 's Cam Winstanley said that it is " an example of what an adventure game should be like – funny , enthralling and convincing . " Adventure Gamers ' Claire Wood called it an " enjoyable " , " engaging adventure classic , thoroughly enjoyable playing experience " and " a 1984 for the computer game generation . " 
 Winstanley thought that the main highpoint of the game was the story , with an ending " that 's actually quite a surprise . " Wood praised the " intelligent , thought provoking storyline " that " becomes more and more compelling , punctuated by unexpected plot twists and macabre discoveries . " 
 Dillon praised the game 's " stunning " graphics . Mead said the comic book @-@ like artwork projected a great " atmosphere " . Winstanley felt that the game looked " superb " . Wood said the graphics " have aged reasonably well " . 
 Many of the critics praised the game 's " adult humour " , showcased through numerous one @-@ liners and double entendres . Dillon praised the charm of the various characters and their personalities built through conversations . Wood also praised the Revolution 's " trademark " " light @-@ hearted humour " . Both Dillon and Wood , as well as Winstanley , highlighted Joey 's witty remarks . Poole called the writing " some of the funniest dialog ever " and the characters " warped " and " interesting " . 
 Reviewers praised the game 's puzzles for being logical but still challenging . Poole found the puzzles to be " tricky " and " engaging " , but stated " the difficulty of the puzzles in the final third of the game is disproportionately high " and that he disliked some of the " race the clock " puzzles . On the other hand , Winstanley felt that the " real time " puzzles " add pace " . Wood 's only gripe with the puzzles were the " odd and disorienting " LINC @-@ space sequences . 
 Dillon wrote that the controls were so " simple that Revolution can finally lay claim to having created the ultimate in intuitive control methods . " Poole labeled them " a masterwork of simplicity " . Winstanley also praised the " simple " interface , while Wood said that the " unobtrusive interface " is one of the factors that make the game a " highly immersive experience " .

 The remastered 2009 iOS version was also very well received . It holds an aggregate score of 85 % on GameRankings , based on seven reviews , and 82 out of 100 on Metacritic , based on five reviews . It was nominated for Best Port / Enhanced Re @-@ release at the Adventure Gamers ' 2009 Aggie Awards in 2010 . The game sold around 20 @,@ 000 units in its first month of release , while Cecil anticipated sales of around 70 @,@ 000 copies during its first year on sale , and roughly 100 @,@ 000 in its lifetime . 
 The remastered release is available with Spanish , French , Swedish , Portuguese , German , Italian , and English subtitles . 
 Slide To Play 's Keith Andrew said that " Beneath a Steel Sky somehow feels bigger and bolder than its rivals , raising the bar and highlighting what others have so far failed to achieve . Perfectly suited to its new home , this remastering of a classic game serves up point @-@ and @-@ click play nearly unmatched on the App Store . " Andrew noted that the point @-@ and @-@ click interface " <unk> [ es ] seamlessly with touchscreen controls " and that the hint system is " a feature that might antagonize some of Steel Sky ’ s hardened fan @-@ base , but one perfectly pitched at the iPhone generation . " 
 IGN 's Eduardo Vasconcellos stated that the game " is a reminder of how good the old point @-@ and @-@ <unk> really were . The updated elements only add to the experience -- especially the cutscenes . If you 're looking for an intriguing story , solid gameplay and some nostalgic charm , Beneath a Steel Sky is for you . " Vasconcellos applauded the " intuitive and responsive " touch controls and said that the " visuals are an attractive update of the original release . " He gave the game an " Editor 's Choice " award . 
 Pocket Gamer 's Tracy Erickson said that the game " remains as entertaining as it did 15 years ago , galvanising the adventure gaming resurgence on iPhone . " Erickson felt that the touch controls are " only functional and not fantastic , " but that " measures have been taken to address [ problems of the original point @-@ and click interface ] to a respectable degree , " and that the " minimally enhanced presentation raises alarm . " However , he concluded that even though " More could have been done to brush the dust off this ageing title , " " it 's still a standout game . " He gave it a " Silver Award " .

 In 2004 , Cecil commented " Beneath a Steel Sky 2 is a project Revolution has been considering for a while , and has started to move forward on , but we are unable to comment beyond this . " 
 In an interview with Eurogamer in 2006 , Cecil spoke of his admiration for the work done by ScummVM and the resulting interest in a sequel . He also stated that if he were to make the game he " would dearly love to work with Dave Gibbons again . " In a February 20 , 2009 interview with IGN UK about the Wii and DS versions of Broken Sword : The Director 's Cut , Cecil and Gibbons re @-@ iterated their interest in a sequel to Beneath a Steel Sky . 
 In September 2012 , Revolution announced that Beneath a Steel Sky 2 would be greenlit if their Broken Sword 5 : The Serpent 's Curse Kickstarter reached $ 1 million . Despite Broken Sword : The Serpent 's Curse failing to meet the $ 1 million ' stretch goal ' , Revolution announced that the success of its crowdfunding campaign had inspired them to greenlight Beneath a Steel Sky 2 . However , Revolution later clarified that Beneath a Steel Sky 2 will not necessarily be the studio 's first project following Broken Sword 5 and that they would " think " about what their next game will be after finishing the Broken Sword game . In February 2014 it was reported that Beneath a Steel Sky 2 had never entered production , despite previous reports to the contrary . The reason cited was that the Broken Sword franchise took up the sole focus of the company . 
 = Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository = 
 The Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository , as designated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments of 1987 , was to be a deep geological repository storage facility for spent nuclear fuel and other high level radioactive waste . The site is located on federal land adjacent to the Nevada Test Site in Nye County , Nevada , about 80 mi ( 130 km ) northwest of the Las Vegas Valley . 
 The project was approved in 2002 by the United States Congress , but Federal funding for the site ended in 2011 under the Obama Administration via amendment to the Department of Defense and Full @-@ Year Continuing Appropriations Act , passed on April 14 , 2011 . The project has had many difficulties and was highly contested by the general public and many politicians . The Government Accountability Office stated that the closure was for political , not technical or safety reasons . 
 This leaves US non @-@ governmental entities , such as utilities , without any designated long term storage site for the high level radioactive waste stored on @-@ site at various nuclear facilities around the country . The US government disposes of its waste at <unk> in New Mexico , in rooms 2 @,@ 150 feet ( 660 m ) underground . The Department of Energy ( DOE ) is reviewing other options for a high @-@ level waste repository and the Blue Ribbon Commission on America 's Nuclear Future , established by the Secretary of Energy , released its final report in January 2012 . It expressed urgency to find a consolidated , geological repository , and that any future facility should be developed by a new independent organization with direct access to the Nuclear Waste Fund , that is not subject to political and financial control like the DOE . In the meantime , most nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to the indefinite on @-@ site dry cask storage of waste in nearly impervious steel and concrete casks . 
 = = Background = = 
 Spent nuclear fuel is the radioactive by @-@ product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants , and high @-@ level radioactive waste is the by @-@ product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons . In 1982 , the United States Congress established a national policy to solve the problem of nuclear waste disposal . This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act , which made the DOE responsible for finding a site , building , and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository . The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground . 
 The DOE began studying Yucca Mountain in 1978 to determine whether it would be suitable for the nation 's first long @-@ term geologic repository for over 70 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 69 @,@ 000 long tons ; 77 @,@ 000 short tons ) ( 150 million pounds ) of spent nuclear fuel and high @-@ level radioactive waste as of 2015 stored at 121 sites around the nation . An estimated 10 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 800 long tons ; 11 @,@ 000 short tons ) of the waste would be from America 's military nuclear programs . On December 19 , 1984 , the DOE selected ten locations in six states for consideration as potential repository sites , based on data collected for nearly ten years . The ten sites were studied and results of these preliminary studies were reported in 1985 . Based on these reports , President Ronald Reagan approved three sites for intensive scientific study called site characterization . The three sites were Hanford , Washington ; Deaf Smith County , Texas ; and Yucca Mountain . In 1987 , Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed DOE to study only Yucca Mountain , which is located within a former nuclear test site . The Act provided that if during site characterization the Yucca Mountain location was found unsuitable , studies would be stopped immediately . This option expired when the site was actually recommended by the President . On July 23 , 2002 , President George W. Bush signed House Joint Resolution 87 , ( Pub.L. 107 – 200 ) allowing the DOE to take the next step in establishing a safe repository in which to store the country 's nuclear waste . The DOE was to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain Repository by January 31 , 1998 but did not do so because of a series of delays due to legal challenges , concerns over how to transport nuclear waste to the facility , and political pressures resulting in underfunding of the construction . 
 On July 18 , 2006 the DOE proposed March 31 , 2017 as the date to open the facility and begin accepting waste based on full funding . On September 8 , 2006 Ward ( Edward ) Sproat , a nuclear industry executive formerly of PECO energy in Pennsylvania , was nominated by President Bush to lead the Yucca Mountain Project . Following the 2006 mid @-@ term Congressional elections , Democratic Nevada Senator Harry Reid , a longtime opponent of the repository , became the Senate Majority Leader , putting him in a position to greatly affect the future of the project . Reid has said that he would continue to work to block completion of the project , and is quoted as having said : " Yucca Mountain is dead . It 'll never happen . " 
 In the 2008 Omnibus Spending Bill , the Yucca Mountain Project 's budget was reduced to $ 390 million . The project was able to reallocate resources and delay transportation expenditures to complete the License Application for submission on June 3 , 2008 . Lacking an operating repository , the federal government owes utility companies somewhere between $ 300 and $ 500 million per year in compensation for failing to comply with the contract it signed to take the spent nuclear fuel by 1998 . 
 During his 2008 presidential campaign , Barack Obama promised to abandon the Yucca Mountain project . As a result , Senator Reid moved the Nevada primary to help Obama 's campaign . After his election , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told Obama he did not have the ability to do so . On April 23 , 2009 , Lindsey Graham ( R @-@ South Carolina ) and eight other senators introduced legislation to provide " rebates " from a $ 30 billion federally managed fund into which nuclear power plants had been paying , so as to refund all collected funds if the project was in fact cancelled by Congress . 
 In November 2013 , in response to a lawsuit filed by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute , the US court of appeals ruled that nuclear utilities may stop paying into the nuclear waste recovery fund until either the DOE follows the Nuclear Waste Policy Act , which designates Yucca Mountain as the repository , or Congress changes the law . The fee ended May 16 , 2014 .

 The purpose of the Yucca Mountain project is to comply with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and develop a national site for spent nuclear fuel and high @-@ level radioactive waste storage . The management and operating contractor as of April 1 , 2009 for the project is USA Repository Services , a consortium of government contractors , URS Corporation , Shaw Corporation and Areva Federal Services LLC . After the layoff of 800 employees on March 31 , 2009 , about 100 employees remained on the project until all technical staff were laid off by the end of FY 2010 due to zero funding in the 2011 budget for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management . Sandia National Laboratories had the responsibility for post closure analysis and ensuring compliance with the NWPA . The main tunnel of the Exploratory Studies Facility is U @-@ shaped , 5 mi ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) long and 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) wide . There are also several cathedral @-@ like alcoves that branch from the main tunnel . It is in these alcoves that most of the scientific experiments were conducted . The emplacement drifts ( smaller diameter tunnels branching off the main tunnel ) where waste would have been stored were not constructed since they required a construction authorization by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . The repository has a statutory limit of 77 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 85 @,@ 000 short tons ) . To store this amount of waste would have required 40 miles ( 64 km ) of tunnels . The Nuclear Waste Policy Act further limits the capacity of the repository to 63 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 62 @,@ 000 long tons ; 69 @,@ 000 short tons ) of initial heavy metal in commercial spent fuel . The 104 U.S. commercial reactors currently operating will produce this quantity of spent fuel by 2014 , assuming that the spent fuel rods are not reprocessed . Currently , the US has no civil reprocessing plant . 
 By 2008 , Yucca Mountain was one of the most studied pieces of geology in the world ; between geologic studies and materials science the United States had invested US $ 9 billion on the project . The DOE estimates that it has over 100 million U.S. gallons of highly radioactive waste and 2 @,@ 500 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 800 short tons ) of spent fuel from the production of nuclear weapons and from research activities in temporary storage . The cost of the facility is being paid for by a combination of a tax on each kilowatt hour of nuclear power and by the taxpayers for disposal of weapons and naval nuclear waste . Based on the 2001 cost estimate , approximately 73 percent is funded from consumers of nuclear @-@ powered electricity and 27 percent by the taxpayers . The Total System Life Cycle Cost presented to Congress on July 15 , 2008 by Director Sproat was $ 90 billion . This cost , could not be compared to previous estimates since it included a repository capacity about twice as large as previously estimated over a much longer period of time ( 100 years vs 30 years ) . Additionally , the cost of the project continued to escalate because of insufficient funding to most efficiently move forward and complete the project . By 2007 , the DOE announced it was seeking to double the size of the Yucca Mountain repository to a capacity of 135 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 149 @,@ 000 short tons ) , or 300 million pounds . 
 The tunnel boring machine ( TBM ) that excavated the main tunnel cost $ 13 million and was 400 ft ( 120 m ) in length when in operation . It now sits at its exit point at the South Portal ( south entrance ) of the facility . The short side tunnel alcoves were excavated using explosives .

 The DOE was scheduled to begin accepting spent fuel at the Yucca Mountain repository by January 31 , 1998 . As of 2010 , years after this deadline , the future status of the repository at Yucca Mountain was still unknown due to on @-@ going litigation , and opposition by Senator Harry Reid . 
 Because of construction delays , a number of nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to dry cask storage of waste on @-@ site indefinitely in nearly impervious steel and concrete casks . 
 The project is widely opposed in Nevada and is a hotly debated national topic . A two @-@ thirds majority of <unk> feel it is unfair for their state to have to store nuclear waste when there are no nuclear power plants in Nevada Many <unk> ' opposition stemmed from the so @-@ called " Screw Nevada Bill , " the 1987 legislation halting study of Hanford and Texas as potential sites for the waste before conclusions could be made . The local county in which the proposed facility is located , Nye County , supports the development of the repository as do six adjoining counties . 
 One point of concern has been the standard of radiation emission from 10 @,@ 000 years to 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 years into the future . On August 9 , 2005 , the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed a limit of 350 millirem per year for that period . In October 2007 , the DOE issued a draft of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in which it shows that for the first 10 @,@ 000 years mean public dose would be 0 @.@ 24 mrem / year and that thereafter to 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 years the median public dose would be 0 @.@ 98 mrem / year , both of which are substantially below the proposed EPA limit . For comparison , a hip x @-@ ray results in a dose around 83 mrem and a CT head or chest scan results in around 1 @,@ 110 mrem . Annually , in the United States , an individual 's doses from background radiation is about 350 mrem , although some places get more than twice that . 
 On February 12 , 2002 , U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham made the decision that this site was suitable to be the nation 's nuclear repository . The governor of Nevada had 90 days to object and did so . However , the United States Congress overrode the objection . If the governor 's objection had stood the project would have been abandoned and a new site chosen . In August 2004 , the repository became an election issue , when Senator John Kerry ( D ) said that he would abandon the plans if elected . 
 In March 2005 , the Energy and Interior departments revealed that several U.S. Geological Survey hydrologists had exchanged e @-@ mails discussing possible falsification of quality assurance documents on water infiltration research . On February 17 , 2006 , the DOE ’ s Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management ( OCRWM ) released a report confirming the technical soundness of infiltration modeling work performed by U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) employees . In March 2006 , the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Majority Staff issued a 25 @-@ page white paper " Yucca Mountain : The Most Studied Real Estate on the Planet . " The conclusions were : 
 Extensive studies consistently show Yucca Mountain to be a sound site for nuclear waste disposal 
 The cost of not moving forward is extremely high 
 Nuclear waste disposal capability is an environmental imperative 
 Nuclear waste disposal capability supports national security 
 Demand for new nuclear plants also demands disposal capability 
 On January 18 , 2006 , DOE OCRWM announced that it would designate Sandia National Laboratories as its lead laboratory to integrate repository science work for the Yucca Mountain Project . " We believe that establishing Sandia as our lead laboratory is an important step in our new path forward . The independent , expert review that the scientists at Sandia will perform will help ensure that the technical and scientific basis for the Yucca Mountain repository is without question , " OCRWM ’ s Acting Director Paul Golan said . " Sandia has unique experience in managing scientific investigations in support of a federally licensed geologic disposal facility , having served in that role as the scientific advisor to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad , New Mexico . " Sandia began acting as the lead laboratory on October 1 , 2006 . 
 Because of questions raised by the State of Nevada and Congressional members about the quality of the science behind Yucca Mountain , the DOE announced on March 31 , 2006 the selection of Oak Ridge Associated Universities / Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education ( a not @-@ for @-@ profit consortium that includes 96 doctoral degree @-@ granting institutions and 11 associate member universities ) to provide expert reviews of scientific and technical work on the Yucca Mountain Project . DOE stated that the Yucca Mountain Project " will be based on sound science . By bringing in Oak Ridge for review of technical work , DOE will seek to present a high level of expertise and credibility as they move the project forward ... This award gives DOE access to academic and research institutions to help DOE meet their mission and legal obligation to license , construct , and open Yucca Mountain as the nation ’ s repository for spent nuclear fuel . " 
 There was significant public and political opposition to the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository project in Nevada . An attempt was made to push ahead with the project and override this opposition . But for large projects which would take decades to complete , there is every chance that sustained local opposition will prevail , and this happened with the Yucca Mountain project . Successful nuclear waste storage siting efforts in Scandinavia have involved local communities in the decision @-@ making process and given them a veto at each stage , but this did not happen with Yucca Mountain . Local communities at potential storage and repository sites " should have early and continued involvement in the process , including funding that would allow them to retain technical experts " . 
 On March 5 , 2009 , Energy Secretary Steven Chu reiterated in a Senate hearing that the Yucca Mountain site was no longer considered an option for storing reactor waste . 
 On March 3 , 2010 , the DOE filed a motion with the NRC to withdraw its license application , however multiple lawsuits to stop this action have been filed by states , counties , and individuals across the country as being unauthorized by the NWPA . 
 = = Radiation standards = = 
 = = = Original standard = = = 
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) established its Yucca Mountain standards in June 2001 . The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem per year for the public outside the Yucca Mountain site . The disposal standards consisted of three components : an individual dose standard , a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository , and a groundwater protection standard . The individual @-@ protection and human intrusion standards set a limit of 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual , who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public . The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA 's Safe Drinking Water Act standards , which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure . The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10 @,@ 000 years after the facility is closed . Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10 @,@ 000 years and be placed in DOE 's Environmental Impact Statement , but were not subject to a compliance standard . The 10 @,@ 000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA 's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act . It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time . 
 = = = Inconsistent standards = = = 
 Shortly after the EPA first established these standards in 2001 , the nuclear industry , several environmental and public interest groups , and the State of Nevada challenged the standards in court . In July 2004 , the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found in favor of the Agency on all counts except one : the 10 @,@ 000 year regulatory time frame . The court ruled that EPA ’ s 10 @,@ 000 @-@ year compliance period for isolation of radioactive waste was not consistent with National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) recommendations and was too short . The NAS report had recommended standards be set for the time of peak risk , which might approach a period of one million years . By limiting the compliance time to 10 @,@ 000 years , EPA did not respect a statutory requirement that it develop standards consistent with NAS recommendations . 
 = = = EPA 's rule = = = 
 EPA published in the Federal Register a final rule in 2009 . The new rule limits radiation doses from Yucca Mountain for up to 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 years after it closes . Within that regulatory time frame , the EPA has two dose standards that would apply based on the number of years from the time the facility is closed . 
 For the first 10 @,@ 000 years , the EPA would retain the 2001 final rule ’ s dose limit of 15 millirem per year . This is protection at the level of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today . From 10 @,@ 000 to one million years , EPA established a dose limit of 100 millirem per year . EPA 's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes , considering the effects of earthquakes , volcanic activity , climate change , and container corrosion , over one million years . The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1 mrem / year public dose through 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 years . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The formation that makes up Yucca Mountain was created by several large eruptions from a caldera volcano and is composed of alternating layers of ignimbrite ( welded tuff ) , non @-@ welded tuff , and semi @-@ welded tuff . The tuff surround the burial sites is expected to protect human health as it provides a natural barrier to the radiation . It lies along the transition between the Mohave and the Great Basin Deserts . 
 The volcanic tuff at Yucca Mountain is appreciably fractured and movement of water through an aquifer below the waste repository is primarily through fractures . While the fractures are usually confined to individual layers of tuff , the faults extend from the planned storage area all the way to the water table 600 to 1 @,@ 500 ft ( 180 to 460 m ) below the surface . Future water transport from the surface to waste containers is likely to be dominated by fractures . There is evidence that surface water has been transported down through the 700 ft ( 210 m ) of overburden to the exploratory tunnel at Yucca Mountain in less than 50 years . 
 Some site opponents assert that , after the predicted containment failure of the waste containers , these cracks may provide a route for movement of radioactive waste that dissolves in the water flowing downward from the desert surface . Officials state that the waste containers will be stored in such a way as to minimize or even nearly eliminate this possibility . 
 The area around Yucca Mountain received much more rain in the geologic past and the water table was consequently much higher than it is today , though well below the level of the repository . 
 = = = Earthquakes = = = 
 Nevada ranks fourth in the nation for current seismic activity . Earthquake databases ( the Council of the National Seismic System Composite Catalogue and the Southern Great Basin Seismic Network ) provide current and historical earthquake information . Analysis of the available data in 1996 indicates that , since 1976 , there have been 621 seismic events of magnitude greater than 2 @.@ 5 within a 50 @-@ mile ( 80 km ) radius of Yucca Mountain . 
 DOE has stated that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not significantly affect repository performance . Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation , but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10 @,@ 000 @-@ year regulatory compliance period . Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be , at most , a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository . The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake @-@ faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years , and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10 @,@ 000 years . The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water , even under severe seismic loading . 
 In September 2007 , it was discovered that the Bow Ridge fault line ran underneath the facility , hundreds of feet east of where it was originally thought to be located , beneath a storage pad where spent radioactive fuel canisters would be cooled before being sealed in a maze of tunnels . The discovery required several structures to be moved several hundred feet further to the east , and drew criticism from Robert R. <unk> , then head of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects , who argues that Yucca administrators should have known about the fault line 's location years prior , and called the movement of the structures “ just @-@ in @-@ time engineering . ” In June 2008 , a major nuclear equipment supplier , <unk> International , criticized the Department of Energy 's safety plan for handling containers of radioactive waste before they are buried at the proposed Yucca Mountain dump . The concern is that , in an earthquake , the unanchored casks of nuclear waste material awaiting burial at Yucca Mountain could be sent into a " chaotic melee of bouncing and rolling juggernauts " . 
 = = Transportation of waste = = 
 The nuclear waste was planned to be shipped to the site by rail and / or truck in robust containers known as spent nuclear fuel shipping casks , approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . While the routes in Nevada would have been public , in the other states the planned routes , dates and times of transport would have been secret for security reasons . State and tribal representatives would have been notified before shipments of spent nuclear fuel enter their jurisdictions . 
 = = = Nevada routes = = = 
 Within Nevada , the planned primary mode of transportation was via rail through the Caliente Corridor . This corridor starts in Caliente , Nevada , traveling along the northern and western borders of the Nevada Test Site for approximately 200 miles ( 320 km ) . At this point , it turns south . 
 Other options that were being considered included a rail route along the Mina corridor . This rail route would have originated at the Fort Churchill Siding rail line , near <unk> . The proposed corridor would have proceeded southeast through Hawthorne , Blair Junction , Lida Junction and Oasis Valley . At Oasis Valley , the rail line would have turned north @-@ northeast towards Yucca Mountain . Use of this rail corridor by the Department of Energy would have required permission from the Walker River Paiute Tribe in order to cross their land . As the first 54 miles ( 87 km ) of the proposed corridor was owned by the Department of Defense , additional permission from the DoD would have to have been granted . 
 = = = Impacts = = = 
 Since the early 1960s , the U.S. has safely conducted more than 3 @,@ 000 shipments of spent nuclear fuel without any harmful release of radioactive material . This safety record is comparable to the worldwide experience where more than 70 @,@ 000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have been transported since 1970 – an amount approximately equal to the total amount of spent nuclear fuel that would have been shipped to Yucca Mountain . However , cities were still concerned about the transport of radioactive waste on highways and railroads that may have passed through heavily populated areas . Dr. Robert Halstead , who was a transportation adviser to the state of Nevada since 1988 , stated regarding transportation of the high level waste , " They would heavily affect cities like Buffalo , Cleveland , Pittsburgh , in the Chicago metropolitan area , in Omaha . " " Coming out of the south , the heaviest impacts would be in Atlanta , in Nashville , St. Louis , Kansas City , moving across through Salt Lake City , through downtown Las Vegas , up to Yucca Mountain . And the same cities would be affected by rail shipments as well . " Spencer Abraham ( DOE ) on the other hand has stated , " I think there 's a general understanding that we move hazardous materials in this country , an understanding that the federal government knows how to do it safely . " 
 = = Cultural impact = = 
 Archaeological surveys have found evidence that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis . Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter @-@ gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before <unk> began using the area for prospecting , surveying , and ranching . They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact . 
 Yucca Mountain and surrounding lands were central in the lives of the Southern Paiute , Western Shoshone , and Owens Valley Paiute and Shoshone peoples , who shared them for religious ceremonies , resource uses , and social events .

 Since 2009 , the Obama administration has been attempting to close the Yucca Mountain repository , despite current US law that designates Yucca Mountain as the nation 's nuclear waste repository . The administration agency , DOE , began implementation of the President 's plan in May 2009 . The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has also gone along with the administration 's closure plan . Various state and Congressional entities have attempted to challenge the administration 's closure plans , by statute and in court . Most recently , in August 2013 , a US Court of Appeals decision has told the NRC and the Obama administration that they must either " approve or reject the Energy Department 's application for [ the ] never @-@ completed waste storage site at Nevada 's Yucca Mountain . " They cannot simply make plans for its closure in violation of US law . 
 In May 2009 , then United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu stated : 
 " Yucca Mountain as a repository is off the table . What we 're going to be doing is saying , let 's step back . We realize that we know a lot more today than we did 25 or 30 years ago . The NRC is saying that the dry cask storage at current sites would be safe for many decades , so that gives us time to figure out what we should do for a long @-@ term strategy . We will be assembling a blue @-@ ribbon panel to look at the issue . We 're looking at reactors that have a high @-@ energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long @-@ lived actinide waste . These are fast @-@ neutron reactors . There 's others : a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy , but again creates high @-@ energy neutrons that can burn down the long @-@ lived actinides . ... 
 " Some of the waste is already vitrified . There is , in my mind , no economical reason why you would ever think of pulling it back into a potential fuel cycle . So one could well imagine — again , it depends on what the blue @-@ ribbon panel says — one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste , you don 't want to have access to it anymore , so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain , such as salt domes . Once you put it in there , the salt oozes around it . These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale . The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don 't have access to it anymore . But say for certain types of waste you don 't want to have access to it anymore — that 's good . It 's a very natural containment . ... whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value , let 's keep it around for a hundred years , two hundred years , because there 's a high likelihood we 'll come back to it and want to recover that . 
 " So the real thing is , let 's get some really wise heads together and figure out how you want to deal with the interim and long @-@ term storage . Yucca was supposed to be everything to everybody , and I think , knowing what we know today , there 's going to have to be several regional areas . " 
 In 2008 , the U.S. Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works found that failure to perform to contractual requirements could cost taxpayers up to $ 11 billion by 2020 . In 2013 this estimate of taxpayer liability was raised to $ 21 billion . In July 2009 , the House of Representatives voted 388 to 30 on amendments to <unk> ( Roll call vote 591 , via <unk> ) to not defund the Yucca Mountain repository in the FY2010 budget . In 2013 , the House of Representatives voted twice during the 2014 Energy and Water Appropriations debate by over 80 % majority to reject elimination of Yucca Mountain as the nation 's only nuclear waste solution . 
 On April 13 , 2010 , the state of Washington filed suit to prevent the closing of Yucca Mountain , since this would slow efforts to clean up Hanford Nuclear Reservation . South Carolina , Aiken County ( the location of Savannah River site ) and others joined Washington . The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit in July 2011 , saying the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had not ruled on the withdrawal of the license application . Washington and South Carolina filed another lawsuit on July 29 . 
 With $ 32 billion received from power companies to fund the project , and $ 12 billion spent to study and build it , the federal government had $ 27 billion left , including interest . In March 2012 , Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a bill requiring three @-@ fourths of that money to be given back to customers , and the remainder to the companies for storage improvements . 
 In August 2013 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to either " approve or reject the Energy Department 's application for [ the ] never @-@ completed waste storage site at Nevada 's Yucca Mountain . " The court opinion said that the NRC was " simply flouting the law " in its previous action to allow the Obama administration to continue plans to close the proposed waste site since a federal law designating Yucca Mountain as the nation 's nuclear waste repository remains in effect . The court opinion stated that " The president may not decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections . "

 = Louis Slotin = 
 Louis Alexander Slotin ( 1 December 1910 – 30 May 1946 ) was a Canadian physicist and chemist who worked on the Manhattan Project . During World War II , Slotin conducted research at Los Alamos National Laboratory . He performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values . On 21 May 1946 , Slotin was conducting a demonstration when he accidentally initiated a fission reaction , which released a burst of hard radiation . He received a lethal dose of radiation and died of acute radiation syndrome nine days later . Slotin was the second person to die from a criticality accident , following the death of Harry Daghlian , who had been exposed to radiation by the same core that killed Slotin . Slotin was publicly hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly and preventing his accident from killing any colleagues . He was later criticized for failing to follow protocol during the experiment . 
 Others were injured and may have died from nuclear related exposure some years later . With the end of World War II , the work to build additional nuclear devices was less urgent , and the accident halted work for a while until increased safety protocols were implemented at Los Alamos . The incident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non @-@ fiction accounts . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Slotin was the first of three children born to Israel and Sonia Slotin , Yiddish @-@ speaking refugees who had fled the pogroms of Russia to Winnipeg , Manitoba . He grew up in the North End neighborhood of Winnipeg , an area with a large concentration of Eastern European immigrants . From his early days at <unk> Elementary School through his teenage years at St. John 's High School , Slotin was academically exceptional . His younger brother , Sam , later remarked that his brother " had an extreme intensity that enabled him to study long hours . " 
 At the age of 16 , Slotin entered the University of Manitoba to pursue a degree in science . During his undergraduate years , he received a University Gold Medal in both physics and chemistry . Slotin received a B.Sc. degree in geology from the university in 1932 and a M.Sc. degree in 1933 . With the assistance of one of his mentors , he obtained a fellowship to study at King 's College London under the supervision of Arthur John <unk> , the chair of the chemistry department , who specialized in the field of applied electrochemistry and photochemistry . 
 = = = King 's College = = = 
 While at King 's College , Slotin distinguished himself as an amateur boxer by winning the college 's amateur bantamweight boxing championship . Later , he gave the impression that he had fought for the Spanish Republic and trained to fly a fighter with the Royal Air Force . Author Robert Jungk recounted in his book Brighter than a Thousand Suns : A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists , the first published account of the Manhattan Project , that Slotin " had volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War , more for the sake of the thrill of it than on political grounds . He had often been in extreme danger as an anti @-@ aircraft gunner . " During an interview years later , Sam stated that his brother had gone " on a walking tour in Spain " , and he " did not take part in the war " as previously thought . Slotin earned a Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry from the university in 1936 . He won a prize for his thesis entitled " An Investigation into the Intermediate Formation of Unstable Molecules During some Chemical Reactions . " Afterwards , he spent six months working as a special investigator for Dublin 's Great Southern Railways , testing the <unk> nickel @-@ zinc rechargeable batteries used on the Dublin – Bray line . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = University of Chicago = = = 
 In 1937 , after he unsuccessfully applied for a job with Canada 's National Research Council , the University of Chicago accepted him as a research associate . There , Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry , helping to build the first cyclotron in the midwestern United States . The job paid poorly and Slotin 's father had to support him for two years . From 1939 to 1940 , Slotin collaborated with Earl Evans , the head of the university 's biochemistry department , to produce radiocarbon ( carbon @-@ 14 and carbon @-@ 11 ) from the cyclotron . While working together , the two men also used carbon @-@ 11 to demonstrate that plant cells had the capacity to use carbon dioxide for carbohydrate synthesis , through carbon fixation . 
 Slotin might have been present at the start @-@ up of Enrico Fermi 's " Chicago Pile @-@ 1 " , the first nuclear reactor , on 2 December 1942 ; the accounts of the event do not agree on this point . During this time , Slotin also contributed to several papers in the field of <unk> . His expertise on the subject garnered the attention of the United States government , and as a result he was invited to join the Manhattan Project , the United States ' effort to develop a nuclear bomb . Slotin worked on the production of plutonium under future Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner at the university and later at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge , Tennessee . He moved to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico in December 1944 to work in the bomb physics group of Robert Bacher . 
 = = Work at Los Alamos = = 
 At Los Alamos , Slotin 's duties consisted of dangerous criticality testing , first with uranium in Otto Robert Frisch 's experiments , and later with plutonium cores . Criticality testing involved bringing masses of fissile materials to near @-@ critical levels to establish their critical mass values . Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction as " tickling the dragon 's tail " , based on a remark by physicist Richard Feynman , who compared the experiments to " tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon " . On 16 July 1945 , Slotin assembled the core for Trinity , the first detonated atomic device , and became known as the " chief armorer of the United States " for his expertise in assembling nuclear weapons . Slotin received two small circular lead and silver commemorative pins for his work on the project . 
 In the winter of 1945 – 1946 , Slotin shocked some of his colleagues with a bold action . He repaired an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating , rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be shut down . He did not wear his dosimetry badge , but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 roentgen . A dose of 1 Gy ( ~ 100 roentgen ) can cause nausea and vomiting in 10 % of cases , but is generally survivable . 
 = = = Harry Daghlian 's death = = = 
 On 21 August 1945 , laboratory assistant Harry Daghlian , one of Slotin 's close colleagues , was performing a critical mass experiment when he accidentally dropped a heavy tungsten carbide brick onto a 6 @.@ 2 @-@ kilogram ( 14 lb ) plutonium @-@ gallium alloy bomb core . The 24 @-@ year @-@ old Daghlian was irradiated with a large dose of neutron radiation . Later estimates would suggest that this dose might not have been fatal on its own , but he then received additional delayed gamma radiation and beta burns while disassembling his experiment . He quickly collapsed with acute radiation poisoning and died 25 days later in the Los Alamos base hospital . 
 = = = Planned return to teaching = = = 
 After the war , Slotin expressed growing disdain for his personal involvement in the project . He remarked , " I have become involved in the Navy tests , much to my disgust . " Unfortunately for Slotin , his participation at Los Alamos was still required because , as he said , " I am one of the few people left here who are experienced bomb putter @-@ <unk> . " He looked forward to resuming teaching and research into biophysics and <unk> at the University of Chicago . He began training a replacement , Alvin C. Graves , to take over his Los Alamos work . 
 = = = Criticality accident = = = 
 On 21 May 1946 , with seven colleagues watching , Slotin performed an experiment that involved the creation of one of the first steps of a fission reaction by placing two half @-@ spheres of beryllium ( a neutron reflector ) around a 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch @-@ diameter ( 89 mm ) plutonium core . The experiment used the same 6 @.@ 2 @-@ kilogram ( 13 @.@ 7 lb ) plutonium core that had irradiated Harry Daghlian , later called the " demon core " for its role in the two accidents . Slotin grasped the upper 9 @-@ inch beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half @-@ spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand , having removed the shims normally used . Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol . 
 At 3 : 20 p.m. , the screwdriver slipped and the upper beryllium hemisphere fell , causing a " prompt critical " reaction and a burst of hard radiation . At the time , the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave . Slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and an intense burning sensation in his left hand . He jerked his left hand upward , lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor , ending the reaction . However , he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation . At the time of the accident , dosimetry badges were in a locked box about 100 feet ( 30 m ) from the accident . Realizing that no one in the room had their film badges on , " immediately after the accident Dr. Slotin asked to have the badges taken from the lead box and placed on the critical assembly " . This peculiar response was attributed to " vertigo " and was of no value for determining the actual doses received by the men in the room . 
 Others in the room at the time included Raemer E. Schreiber , Alvin Cushman Graves , Stanley Allan Kline , Marion Edward <unk> , Dwight Smith Young , Theodore P. Perlman , and Pvt. Patrick J. Cleary . 
 As soon as Slotin left the building , he vomited , a common reaction from exposure to extremely intense ionizing radiation . Slotin 's colleagues rushed him to the hospital , but the radiation damage was irreversible . 
 By 25 May 1946 , four of the eight men exposed during the incident had been discharged from hospital . The Army doctor responsible for the hospital , Captain Paul Hageman , said that Slotin , Graves , Kline and Young 's " immediate condition is satisfactory . " 
 = = = = Slotin 's death = = = = 
 Despite intensive medical care and offers from numerous volunteers to donate blood for transfusions , Slotin 's condition rapidly deteriorated , Slotin called his parents and they were flown at Army expense from Winnipeg to be with their son . They arrived on the fourth day after the incident , and by the fifth day Slotin 's condition started to rapidly deteriorate . 
 Over the next nine days , Slotin suffered an " agonizing sequence of radiation @-@ induced traumas " , including severe diarrhea , reduced urine output , swollen hands , erythema , " massive blisters on his hands and forearms " , intestinal paralysis , and gangrene . He had internal radiation burns throughout his body , which one medical expert described as a “ three @-@ dimensional sunburn . ” By the seventh day , he was experiencing periods of “ mental confusion . ” His lips turned blue and he was put in an oxygen tent . He ultimately experienced " a total disintegration of bodily functions " and slipped into a coma . Slotin died at 11 a.m. on 30 May , in the presence of his parents . He was buried in Shaarey Zedek Cemetery , Winnipeg , on 2 June 1946 . 
 = = = = Other injuries and deaths = = = = 
 Graves , Kline and Young remained hospitalized after Slotin 's death . Graves , who was standing the closest to Slotin , also developed acute radiation sickness and was hospitalized for several weeks . He survived , although he lived with chronic neurological and vision problems . Young also suffered from acute radiation syndrome , but recovered . By 28 January 1948 Graves , Kline and Perlman sought compensation for damages suffered during the incident . Graves settled his claim for $ 3 @,@ 500 . 
 Three of the observers eventually died of conditions that are known to be promoted by radiation : Graves of a heart attack 20 years later at age 55 ; <unk> of acute myeloid leukemia 19 years later at age 42 ; and Young of aplastic anemia and bacterial infection of the heart lining 27 years later at age 83 . Although some of those deaths were probably latent stochastic ( random ) effects of the accident , it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions from such a small sample set . 
 = = = = Disposition of core = = = = 
 The core involved was intended to be used in the Able detonation , during the Crossroads series of nuclear weapon testing . Slotin 's experiment was said to be the last conducted before the core 's detonation and was intended to be the final demonstration of its ability to go critical . After the criticality accident it needed time to cool . It was therefore rescheduled for the third test of the series , provisionally named Charlie , but this was cancelled due to the unexpected level of radioactivity after the underwater Baker test and the inability to decontaminate the target warships . It was later melted down and reused in a later core .

 The radiation doses received in these two accidents are not known with any semblance of accuracy .

The available equipment , film badges , were not worn by personnel during the accident , and badges that were supposed to be planted under tables in case of disasters like these were not found . Disaster badges hung on the walls did provide some useful data about gamma radiation . 
 A " tentative " estimate of the doses involved was made in 1948 , based on dozens of assumptions , some of which are now known to be grossly incorrect . In the absence of personal dosimetry badges , the study authors relied on measurements of sodium activation in the victims ' blood and urine samples as their primary source of data . This activation would have been caused by neutron radiation , but they converted all doses to equivalent doses of gamma or X @-@ ray radiation . They concluded that Daghlian and Slotin had probably received doses equivalent to 290 and 880 rem ( respectively ) of gamma rays . Minimum and maximum estimates varied from about 50 % to 200 % of these values . The authors also calculated doses equivalent to a mix of soft 80 keV X @-@ rays and gamma rays , which they believed gave a more realistic picture of the exposure than the gamma equivalent . In this model the equivalent X @-@ ray doses were much higher , but would be concentrated in the tissues facing the source , whereas the gamma component penetrated the whole body . Slotin 's equivalent dose was estimated to be 1930 R of X @-@ ray with 114 R of gamma , while Daghlian 's equivalent dose was estimated to be 480 R of X @-@ ray with 110 R of gamma . Five hundred REM is usually a fatal dose for humans . 
 In modern times dosimetry is done very differently . Equivalent doses would not be reported in roentgen ; they would be calculated with different weighting factors , and they are not considered as relevant to acute radiation syndrome as absorbed doses . Recent documents have made various interpretations of Slotin 's dose , ranging from 287 rad to 21 sievert . Based on citations and supporting reasoning , the most reliable estimate may be a 1978 Los Alamos memo which suggested 10 Gy ( n ) + 1 @.@ 14 Gy ( γ ) for Slotin and 2 Gy ( n ) + 1 @.@ 1 Gy ( γ ) for Daghlian . These doses are consistent with the symptoms they experienced .

 After the accident , Los Alamos ended all hands @-@ on critical assembly work . Future criticality testing of fissile cores was done with remotely controlled machines , such as the " Godiva " series , with the operator located a safe distance away to prevent harm in case of accidents . 
 On 14 June 1946 , the associate editor of the Los Alamos Times , Thomas P. <unk> , penned a poem entitled " Slotin – A Tribute " : 
 The official story released at the time was that Slotin , by quickly removing the upper hemisphere , was a hero for ending the critical reaction and protecting seven other observers in the room : " Dr. Slotin 's quick reaction at the immediate risk of his own life prevented a more serious development of the experiment which would certainly have resulted in the death of the seven men working with him , as well as serious injury to others in the general vicinity . " This interpretation of events was endorsed at the time by Alvin Graves , who stood closest to Slotin when the accident occurred . Graves , like Slotin , had previously displayed a low concern for nuclear safety , and would later allege that fallout risks were " concocted in the minds of weak malingerers . " Another witness to the accident , Raemer E. Schreiber , spoke out publicly decades later , arguing that Slotin was using improper and unsafe procedures , endangering the others in the lab along with himself . Robert B. Brode had reported hearsay to that effect back in 1946 . 
 In 1948 , Slotin 's colleagues at Los Alamos and the University of Chicago initiated the Louis A. Slotin Memorial Fund for lectures on physics given by distinguished scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Nobel laureates Luis Walter Alvarez and Hans Bethe . The memorial fund lasted until 1962 . 
 In 2002 , an asteroid discovered in 1995 was named <unk> Slotin in his honour . 
 = = = Dollar unit of reactivity = = = 
 According to Weinberg and Wigner , Slotin was the first to propose the name dollar for the interval of reactivity between delayed and prompt criticality ; 0 is the point of self @-@ sustaining chain reaction , a dollar is the point at which slowly released , delayed neutrons are no longer required to support chain reaction , and enters the domain called " prompt ( super- ) critical " . Stable nuclear reactors operate between 0 and a dollar ; excursions and nuclear explosives operate above a dollar . The hundredth part of a dollar is called a cent ( reactivity ) . When speaking of purely prompt critical events , some users refer to cents " over critical " as a relative unit .

 The accident has been detailed in at least three films , including the 1989 film Fat Man and Little Boy , a dramatization of the Manhattan Project starring Paul Newman . John Cusack plays a fictional character named Michael Merriman who recreates Slotin 's criticality accident at the same time the first atomic bomb is being tested . Scenes of Merriman dying of radiation sickness are intercut with scenes of the bomb test as a dramatic technique . Slotin 's accidental death was also the subject of a 1999 documentary by Canwest Global and Great North Productions , <unk> the Dragon 's Tail : The Mystery of Louis Slotin . The film won for Best Director at the Alberta Film Awards . 
 The event was recounted in Dexter Masters ' 1955 novel The Accident , a fictional account of the last few days of the life of a nuclear scientist suffering from radiation poisoning . Slotin also appears as a character in the 1987 TV mini @-@ series Race for the Bomb . Besides the 1955 novel , the accident has been described in more than a dozen fictional and non @-@ fictional accounts related to the U.S. nuclear weapons program , including as a short story in a 1960s children 's academic reading program . Among them is The Dragon 's Tail : Americans Face the Atomic Age . 
 The criticality accident also inspired the Louis Slotin Sonata , a 2001 off @-@ Broadway play directed by David P. Moore . Author Paul Mullin wrote the play as a dramatic recreation of the events that unfolded on 21 May 1946 . 
 Most recently , the accident was reenacted in season 2 episode 4 of the Science Channel 's series Dark Matters : Twisted But True , which first aired in August 2012 . 
 = Minor v. Happersett = 
 Minor v. Happersett , 88 U.S. 162 ( 1875 ) , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Constitution did not grant women the right to vote . The Supreme Court upheld state court decisions in Missouri , which had refused to register a woman as a lawful voter because that state 's laws allowed only men to vote . 
 The Minor v. Happersett ruling was based on an interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The Supreme Court readily accepted that Minor was a citizen of the United States , but it held that the constitutionally protected privileges of citizenship did not include the right to vote . 
 The Nineteenth Amendment , which became a part of the Constitution in 1920 , effectively overruled Minor v. Happersett by prohibiting discrimination in voting rights based on gender . Minor v. Happersett continued to be cited in support of restrictive election laws of other types until the 1960s , when the Supreme Court started interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause to guarantee voting rights . 
 = = Background = = 
 Virginia Minor , a leader of the women 's suffrage movement in Missouri , attempted to register to vote on October 15 , 1872 , in St. Louis County , Missouri , but was refused on the grounds that she was a woman . With the assistance of her husband , Francis Minor ( a lawyer ) , she brought an action in state courts against Reese Happersett , the registrar who had rejected her application to register to vote , alleging that the provisions of the Missouri state constitution which allowed only men to vote were in violation of the United States Constitution , and specifically the Fourteenth Amendment . The key to the Minors ' argument was that citizenship entailed voting rights — an assertion with enough rhetoric on both sides to make it an open question . 
 The Missouri Supreme Court ruled in favor of the registrar and against Minor . The state court observed that the " almost universal practice of all of the States ... from the adoption of the Constitution to the present time " was to restrict voting rights to men only ; and , additionally , that the clear intent of the Fourteenth Amendment was to give the rights of citizenship to the former slaves , and not to force other changes in state laws . The court noted , in particular , that the second section of the Fourteenth Amendment ( penalizing states which denied the right to vote to any of its citizens ) referred specifically to male citizens , and concluded that " this clearly recognizes the right , and seems to anticipate the exercise of the right , on the part of the States to restrict the right of suffrage to the male inhabitants . " 
 Minor appealed the Missouri ruling to the United States Supreme Court , presenting the same arguments before the Supreme Court as had been unsuccessfully put forth before the state court , and additionally proposing that women 's suffrage was consistent with the original intent of the framers of the Constitution . The Supreme Court observed that the sole point at issue was whether the Constitution entitled women to vote despite state laws limiting this right to men only . The state of Missouri did not send counsel to defend its decision before the Supreme Court , choosing instead to justify its decision in a three @-@ sentence demurrer . 
 = = Opinion of the Court = = 
 The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Missouri voting legislation , saying that voting was not an inherent right of citizenship , that the Constitution neither granted nor forbade voting rights for women , and that allowing only male citizens to vote was not an infringement of Minor 's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment . 
 The opinion ( written by Chief Justice Morrison Waite ) first asked whether Minor was a citizen of the United States , and answered that she was , citing both the Fourteenth Amendment and earlier common law . Exploring the common @-@ law origins of citizenship , the court observed that " new citizens may be born or they may be created by naturalization " and that the Constitution " does not , in words , say who shall be natural @-@ born citizens . " Under the common law , according to the court , " it was never doubted that all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves , upon their birth , citizens also . These were natives , or natural @-@ born citizens , as distinguished from aliens or foreigners . " The court observed that some authorities " include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents " — but since Minor was born in the United States and her parents were U.S. citizens , she was unquestionably a citizen herself , even under the narrowest possible definition , and the court thus noted that the subject did not need to be explored in any greater depth . 
 The court then asked whether the right to vote was one of the " privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States " at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment 's adoption in 1868 . Citing a variety of historical sources , it found that it was not . The court reasoned that the Constitution of the United States did not explicitly give citizens an affirmative right to vote and that , throughout the history of the nation from the adoption of the Constitution , a wide variety of persons — including women — were recognized as citizens but denied the right to vote . For example , at the time of the adoption of the Constitution , none of the original Thirteen Colonies gave all citizens the right to vote , all attaching restrictions based on factors such as sex , race , age , and ownership of land . The opinion continues that " it cannot for a moment be doubted that if it had been intended to make all citizens of the United States voters , the framers of the Constitution would not have left it to implication . So important a change in the condition of citizenship as it actually existed , if intended , would have been expressly declared . " 
 = = Subsequent history = = 
 The Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution , ratified in 1920 , prohibited sex @-@ based denial or abridgment of any United States citizen 's right to vote — thus effectively overruling the key holding in Minor v. Happersett . In some later voting rights cases , however , Minor was cited in opposition to the claim that the federal Constitution conferred a general right to vote , and in support of restrictive election laws involving poll taxes , literacy tests , and the role of political parties in special elections . 
 In the 1960s , the Supreme Court started to view voting as a fundamental right covered by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . In a dissenting opinion of a 1964 Supreme Court case involving reapportionment in the Alabama state legislature , Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II included Minor in a list of past decisions about voting and apportionment which were no longer being followed . 
 = Eppa Rixey = 
 Eppa Rixey Jr . ( May 3 , 1891 – February 28 , 1963 ) , nicknamed " Jephtha " , was an American left @-@ handed pitcher who played 21 seasons for the Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds in Major League Baseball from 1912 to 1933 . Rixey was best known as the National League 's leader in career victories for a left @-@ hander with 266 wins until Warren Spahn surpassed his total in 1959 . 
 Rixey attended the University of Virginia where he was a star pitcher . He was discovered by umpire Cy Rigler , who convinced him to sign directly with the Phillies , bypassing minor league baseball entirely . His time with the Phillies was marked by inconsistency . He won 22 games in 1916 , but also led the league in losses twice . In 1915 , the Phillies played in the World Series , and Rixey lost in his only appearance . After being traded to the Reds prior to the 1921 season , he won 20 or more games in a season three times , including a league @-@ leading 25 in 1922 , and posted eight consecutive winning seasons . His skills were declining by the 1929 season , when his record was 10 – 13 with a 4 @.@ 16 earned run average . He pitched another four seasons before retiring after the 1933 season .
