 In 1980 , Coach Marv Levy cut future Hall of Fame Kicker Jan <unk> for little known Nick Lowery , who would become the most accurate kicker in NFL History over the next 14 years . In 1981 , running back Joe Delaney rushed for 1 @,@ 121 yards and was named the AFC Rookie of the Year . The Chiefs finished the season with a 9 – 7 record and entered the 1982 season with optimism . However , the NFL Players Association strike curbed the Chiefs ' chances of returning to the postseason for the first time in over a decade . The Chiefs tallied a 3 – 6 record and in the off @-@ season , Joe Delaney died while trying to save several children from drowning in a pond near his home in Louisiana . 
 The Chiefs made a mistake in drafting quarterback Todd Blackledge over future greats such as Jim Kelly and Dan Marino in the 1983 NFL Draft . Blackledge never started a full season for Kansas City while Kelly and Marino played Hall of Fame careers . While the Chiefs struggled on offense in the 1980s , the Chiefs had a strong defensive unit consisting of Pro Bowlers such as Bill Maas , Albert Lewis , Art Still and Deron Cherry . 
 John Mackovic took over head coaching duties for the 1983 season after Marv Levy was fired . Over the next four seasons , Mackovic coached the Chiefs to a 30 – 34 record , but took the team to its first post @-@ season appearance in 15 years in the 1986 NFL playoffs . Following the team 's loss to the New York Jets in the playoffs , Mackovic was fired . Frank <unk> served as head coach for the next two seasons , but won only eight of 31 games .

 On December 19 , 1988 , owner Lamar Hunt hired Carl Peterson as the team 's new president , general manager , and chief executive officer . Peterson fired head coach Frank <unk> two weeks after taking over and hired Marty Schottenheimer as the club 's seventh head coach . In the 1988 and 1989 NFL Drafts , the Chiefs selected both defensive end Neil Smith and linebacker Derrick Thomas , respectively . The defense that Thomas and Smith anchored in their seven seasons together was a big reason why the Chiefs reached the postseason in six straight years . 
 In Schottenheimer 's tenure as head coach , ( 1989 – 1998 ) , the Chiefs became a perennial playoff contender , featuring offensive players including Steve DeBerg , Christian Okoye , <unk> Paige and Barry Word , a strong defense , anchored by Thomas , Smith , Albert Lewis and Deron Cherry , and on special teams , Nick Lowery , most accurate kicker in NFL History . The team recorded a 101 – 58 – 1 record , and clinched seven playoff berths . The Chiefs ' 1993 season was the franchise 's most successful in 22 years . With newly acquired quarterback Joe Montana and running back Marcus Allen — two former Super Bowl champions and MVPs — the Chiefs further strengthened their position in the NFL . The 11 – 5 Chiefs defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Oilers on their way to the franchise 's first and to date only AFC Championship Game appearance against the Buffalo Bills . The Chiefs were overwhelmed by the Bills and lost the game by a score of 30 – 13 . The Chiefs ' victory on January 14 , 1994 , against the Oilers remained the franchise 's last post @-@ season victory for 21 years until their 30 – 0 victory over the Houston Texans on January 9 , 2016 . 
 In the 1995 NFL playoffs , the 13 – 3 Chiefs hosted the Indianapolis Colts in a cold , damp night game at Arrowhead Stadium . Kansas City lost the game 10 – 7 against the underdog Colts , after kicker Lin Elliot missed three field goal attempts and quarterback Steve Bono threw three interceptions . The Chiefs selected tight end Tony Gonzalez with the 13th overall selection in the 1997 NFL Draft , a move which some considered to be a gamble being that Gonzalez was primarily a basketball player at California . During a 1997 season full of injuries to starting quarterback Elvis Grbac , backup quarterback Rich Gannon took the reins of the Chiefs ' offense as the team headed to another 13 – 3 season . Head coach Marty Schottenheimer chose Grbac to start the playoff game against the Denver Broncos despite Gannon 's successes in previous weeks . Grbac 's production in the game was lacking , and the Chiefs lost to the Broncos 14 – 10 . Denver went on to capture their fifth AFC Championship by defeating Pittsburgh , and then defeated the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII . 
 Coach Schottenheimer announced his resignation from the Chiefs following the 1998 season , and defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham took over coaching duties for the next two seasons , compiling a 16 – 16 record . By the end of the Chiefs ' decade of regular @-@ season dominance , Gannon had signed with the Oakland Raiders , Neil Smith signed with the Denver Broncos , and Derrick Thomas was paralyzed from a car accident on January 23 , 2000 . Thomas died from complications of his injury weeks later . After allegedly reading online that he would be relieved of duties , head coach Gunther Cunningham was fired . 
 Looking to change the Chiefs ' game plan which relied on a tough defensive strategy for the past decade , Carl Peterson contacted Dick Vermeil about the Chiefs ' head coaching vacancy for the 2001 season . Vermeil previously led the St. Louis Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV . Vermeil was hired on January 12 . The Chiefs then traded a first round draft pick in the 2001 NFL Draft to St. Louis for quarterback Trent Green and signed free agent running back Priest Holmes to be the team 's cornerstones on offense . 
 In 2003 , Kansas City began the season with nine consecutive victories , a franchise record . They finished the season with a 13 – 3 record and the team 's offense led the NFL in several categories under the direction of USA Today 's Offensive Coach of the Year honoree , Al Saunders . Running back Priest Holmes surpassed Marshall Faulk 's single @-@ season touchdown record by scoring his 27th rushing touchdown against the Chicago Bears in the team 's regular season finale . The team clinched the second seed in the 2004 NFL playoffs and hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Divisional Playoffs . In a game where neither team punted , the Chiefs lost the shoot @-@ out 38 – 31 . It was the third time in nine seasons that the Chiefs went 8 – 0 at home in the regular season , and earned home field advantage throughout the playoffs , only to lose their post @-@ season opener at Arrowhead . 
 After a disappointing 7 – 9 record in 2004 , the 2005 Chiefs finished with a 10 – 6 record but no playoff berth . They were the fourth team since 1990 to miss the playoffs with a 10 – 6 record . Running back Larry Johnson started in place of the injured Priest Holmes and rushed for 1 @,@ 750 yards in only nine starts . Prior to the Chiefs ' final game of the season , head coach Dick Vermeil announced his retirement . The Chiefs won the game 37 – 3 over the playoff @-@ bound Cincinnati Bengals . 
 Within two weeks of Vermeil 's resignation , the Chiefs returned to their defensive roots with the selection of its next head coach . The team introduced Herman Edwards , a former Chiefs scout and head coach of the New York Jets , as the team 's tenth head coach after trading a fourth @-@ round selection in the 2006 NFL Draft to the Jets . Quarterback Trent Green suffered a severe concussion in the team 's season opener to the Cincinnati Bengals which left him out of play for eight weeks . Backup quarterback Damon Huard took over in Green 's absence and led the Chiefs to a 5 – 3 record . 
 Kansas City was awarded a Thanksgiving Day game against the Denver Broncos in response to owner Lamar Hunt 's lobbying for a third Thanksgiving Day game . The Chiefs defeated the Broncos 19 – 10 in the first Thanksgiving Day game in Kansas City since 1969 . Hunt was hospitalized at the time of the game and died weeks later on December 13 due to complications with prostate cancer . The Chiefs honored their owner for the remainder of the season , as did the rest of the league . 
 Trent Green returned by the end of the season , but struggled in the final stretch , and running back Larry Johnson set an NFL record with 416 carries in a season . Kansas City managed to clinch their first playoff berth in three seasons with a 9 – 7 record and a bizarre sequence of six losses from other AFC teams on New Year 's Eve , culminating with a Broncos loss to the 49ers . The Indianapolis Colts hosted the Chiefs in the Wild Card playoffs and defeated Kansas City 23 – 8 . 
 In 2007 , Trent Green was traded to the Miami Dolphins leaving the door open for either Damon Huard or Brodie Croyle to become the new starting quarterback . After starting the season with a 4 – 3 record , the Chiefs lost the remaining nine games when running back Larry Johnson suffered a season @-@ ending foot injury and the quarterback position lacked stability with Huard and Croyle . Despite the team 's 4 – 12 record , tight end Tony Gonzalez broke Shannon Sharpe 's NFL record for touchdowns at the position ( 63 ) and defensive end Jared Allen led the NFL in quarterback sacks with 15 @.@ 5 . 
 The Chiefs began their 2008 season with the youngest team in the NFL . The starting lineup had an average of 25 @.@ 5 years of age . By releasing several veteran players such as cornerback Ty Law and wide receiver Eddie <unk> and trading defensive end Jared Allen , the Chiefs began a youth movement . The Chiefs had a league @-@ high thirteen selections in the 2008 NFL Draft and chose defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey and offensive lineman Branden Albert in the first round . Analysts quickly called Kansas City 's selections as the best of the entire draft . Entering the season , the Chiefs were unsure if injury @-@ prone quarterback Brodie Croyle , who was the incumbent starter , could be their quarterback in the long @-@ term . Croyle was injured in the team 's first game of the season and Damon Huard started in Croyle 's absence . Tyler Thigpen become the third Chiefs starting quarterback in as many games for a start against the Atlanta Falcons . After a poor performance by Thigpen , in which he threw three interceptions against the Falcons defense , Huard was retained as the starting quarterback . The Chiefs struggled off the field as much as on as tight end Tony Gonzalez demanded a trade and running back Larry Johnson was involved in legal trouble . 
 Croyle returned for the Chiefs ' game against the Tennessee Titans , but both he and Damon Huard suffered season @-@ ending injuries in the game . The Chiefs reorganized their offense to a new spread offense game plan focused around Tyler Thigpen . The Chiefs ' new offense was implemented to help Thigpen play to the best of his abilities and also following the absence of Larry Johnson , who was suspended for his off @-@ field conduct . The Chiefs made a huge gamble by using the spread offense , as most in the NFL believe that it cannot work in professional football , and also head coach Herman Edwards was traditionally in favor of more conservative , run @-@ oriented game plans .

 The 2008 season ended with a franchise worst 2 – 14 record , where the team suffered historic blowout defeats nearly week @-@ in and week @-@ <unk> a 34 – 0 shut @-@ out to the Carolina Panthers , and allowed a franchise @-@ high 54 points against the Buffalo Bills . The team 's general manager , chief executive officer , and team president Carl Peterson resigned at the end of the season , and former New England Patriots vice president of player personnel Scott Pioli was hired as his replacement for 2009 . Upon his arrival , Pioli made an effort to bring in coaches and administrators from his successful past with the New England Patriots , where he won three Super Bowl titles . 
 On January 23 , 2009 , Herman Edwards was fired as head coach , and two weeks later Todd Haley signed a four @-@ year contract to become Edwards ' successor . Haley had a background with Pioli , which made him an attractive hire for Pioli 's first coach in Kansas City . 
 In April 2009 Tony Gonzalez was traded to the Atlanta Falcons after failed trade attempts over the previous two seasons . Notably , head coach Todd Haley fired offensive coordinator Chan Gailey just weeks before the start of the 2009 season and chose to take on the coordinator duties himself . Throughout 2009 the Chiefs acquired veterans to supplement the Chiefs ' young talent including Matt Cassel , Mike <unk> , Bobby Engram , Mike Brown , Chris Chambers , and Andy Alleman . The team finished with a 4 – 12 record , just a two @-@ game improvement upon their record from the 2008 season . 
 For the 2010 season , the Chiefs made significant hires for their coaching staff , bringing on former Patriots assistant coaches Charlie Weis and Romeo Crennel to coach the offense and defense , respectively . The coaching additions proved to be very successful , as the Chiefs would go on to secure their first AFC West title since 2003 . Their ten victories in the 2010 season combined for as many as the team had won in their previous three seasons combined . 
 On January 9 , 2011 , the Chiefs lost their home Wild Card playoff game to the Baltimore Ravens 30 – 7 . Six players were chosen for the Pro Bowl : Dwayne Bowe , Jamaal Charles , Brian Waters , Tamba Hali , Matt Cassel and rookie safety Eric Berry . Jamaal Charles won the <unk> ground player of the year award and Dwayne Bowe led the NFL in Touchdown Receptions . 
 For their first pick in the 2011 NFL draft , and 26th overall , the team selected Jonathan Baldwin , Wide Receiver from Pitt . After a poor start , Haley was relieved of duties as Head Coach on December 12 . Clark Hunt made note of " bright spots at different points this season , " but felt that overall the Chiefs were not progressing . The highest point of the 2011 season was an upset win against the Packers , who at that time , were undefeated with a 13 – 0 record . 
 The Chiefs became the first team since the 1929 Buffalo Bisons to not lead in regulation through any of their first nine games . The Chiefs tied their franchise worst record of 2 – 14 and clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft . It is the first time in franchise history they have held the first overall pick . 
 = = = 2013 – 2014 = = = 
 Following the 2012 season , the Chiefs fired head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli . Former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid was brought in as head coach to work with new general manager John Dorsey , a former Green Bay Packers head scout . 
 The Chiefs acquired quarterback Alex Smith from the San Francisco 49ers for the Chiefs ' second @-@ round pick , 34th overall , in the 2013 draft and a conditional pick in 2014 draft . Matt Cassel was released shortly after . The Chiefs selected Eric Fisher with the first overall pick of the 2013 NFL Draft . 
 The Chiefs started 9 – 0 for the second time in team history . They would lead their wildcard game against the Indianapolis Colts 38 – 10 shortly after halftime , but they would collapse late and lose , 45 – 44 .

 After a promising win for the Chiefs against Houston in Week 1 , Kansas City went on a five @-@ game losing streak culminating in a 16 – 10 loss to Minnesota and the loss of Jamaal Charles to a torn ACL . However , they managed one of the most improbable season comebacks in the NFL and won ten straight to improve their record from 1 – 5 to 11 – 5 . The team clinched a playoff berth after a 17 – 13 win over Cleveland in Week 16 to become only the second NFL team to do so after the merger . 
 The streak achieved by the Chiefs broke a franchise record for 9 straight ( 2003 , 2013 ) and second under Reid . After a Week 17 win over Oakland 23 – 17 , the Chiefs achieved their longest winning streak in franchise history at ten games . They qualified for the playoffs , and started out by beating the Houston Texans in the AFC Wild @-@ Card round , 30 – 0 . It was their first playoff win since 1994 , and incidentally , in the same city as their last playoff win . <unk> with injuries , they were defeated by the New England Patriots 27 – 20 in the AFC Divisional Round .

 Record as of the end of the 2015 NFL season 
 = = Logos and uniforms = = 
 When the Texans began playing in 1960 , the team 's logo consisted of the state of Texas in white with a yellow star marking the location of the city of Dallas . Originally , Hunt chose Columbia blue and orange for the Texans ' uniforms , but Bud Adams chose Columbia blue and scarlet for his Houston Oilers franchise . Hunt reverted to red and gold for the Texans ' uniforms , which even after the team relocated to Kansas City , remain as the franchise 's colors to this day . 
 The state of Texas on the team 's helmet was replaced by an arrowhead design originally sketched by Lamar Hunt on a napkin . Hunt 's inspiration for the interlocking " KC " design was the " SF " inside of an oval on the San Francisco 49ers helmets . Unlike the 49ers ' logo , Kansas City ’ s overlapping initials appear inside a white arrowhead instead of an oval and are surrounded by a thin black outline . From 1960 to 1973 , the Chiefs had grey facemask bars on their helmets , but changed to white bars in 1974 , making them one of the first teams in the NFL to use a non @-@ gray facemask . 
 The Chiefs ' uniform design has essentially remained the same throughout the club 's history . It consists of a red helmet , and either red or white jerseys with the opposite color numbers and names . White pants were used with both jerseys from 1960 to 1967 and 1989 to 1999 . Beginning in 2009 , during the Pioli / Haley era , the team has alternated between white and red pants for road games during the season . Prior to September 15 , 2013 , the Chiefs always wore white pants with their red jerseys . The Chiefs have never worn an alternate jersey in a game , although custom jerseys are sold for retail . 
 The Chiefs wore their white jerseys with white pants at home for the 2006 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals . The logic behind the uniform selection that day was that the Bengals would be forced to wear their black uniforms on a day that forecasted for steamy temperatures . The only other time the Chiefs wore white at home was throughout the 1980 season under Marv Levy . 
 In 2007 , the Kansas City Chiefs honored Lamar Hunt and the AFL with a special patch . It features the AFL 's logo from the 1960s with Hunt 's " LH " initials inside the football . In 2008 , the patch became permanently affixed to the left chest of both Kansas City 's home and away jerseys . 
 In select games for the 2009 season , the Chiefs , as well as the other founding teams of the American Football League , wore " throwback " uniforms to celebrate the AFL 's 50th anniversary . 
 For the first time in team history , the Chiefs wore their red jersey with red pants forming an all red combo in their home opener against the Dallas Cowboys on September 15 , 2013 . 
 = = Arrowhead Stadium = = 
 Arrowhead Stadium has been the Chiefs ' home field since 1972 and has a capacity of 76 @,@ 416 , which makes it the sixth @-@ largest stadium in the NFL . The stadium underwent a $ 375 million renovation , completed in mid @-@ 2010 , which included new luxury boxes , wider concourses and enhanced amenities . The stadium renovation was paid for by $ 250 million in taxpayer money and $ 125 million from the Hunt Family . The stadium cost $ 53 million to build in 1972 , and an average ticket in 2009 costs $ 81 . <unk> serves as the stadium 's concession provider and Sprint Nextel , Anheuser @-@ Busch and Coca @-@ Cola are major corporate sponsors . 
 Dating back to the Chiefs ' home opener in 1991 to mid @-@ 2009 , the Chiefs had 155 consecutive sellout games . The streak ended with the final home game of the 2009 season against the Cleveland Browns , resulting in the first local TV blackout in over 19 years . Arrowhead has been called one of the world 's finest stadiums and has long held a reputation for being one of the toughest and loudest outdoor stadiums for opposing players to play in . All noise is directly attributed to its fans and was once measured at 116 decibels by the Acoustical Design Group of Mission , Kansas . By way of comparison , take @-@ off of aircraft may lead to a sound level of 106 decibels at the ground . Sports Illustrated named Arrowhead Stadium the " toughest place to play " for opposing teams in 2005 . The tailgate party environment outside the stadium on gameday has been compared to a " college football " atmosphere . Arrowhead Stadium features frequent fly @-@ overs from a B @-@ 2 Spirit stealth bomber from nearby Whiteman Air Force Base . Since the 1994 NFL season , the stadium has had a natural grass playing surface . From 1972 to 1993 , the stadium had an artificial AstroTurf surface . 
 During the game against the Oakland Raiders on October 13 , 2013 , Arrowhead Stadium once again became the loudest stadium in the world when the fans set the Guinness Book of World Records record for loudest crowd in an outdoor stadium ( 137 @.@ 5 dB ) , breaking the record set by the Seattle Seahawks just four weeks prior . A few weeks after , Seattle re @-@ gained the record by reaching a noise level of 137 @.@ 6 decibels . Chiefs fans have reclaimed the record once again ; on September 29 , 2014 , on Monday Night Football against the New England Patriots , the fans recorded a sound reading of 142 @.@ 2 decibels . As of the end of the 2014 season , the Chiefs are unbeaten at Arrowhead against the Arizona Cardinals ( 4 – 0 ) and Washington Redskins ( 3 – 0 ) , but winless there against the Baltimore Ravens ( 0 – 3 ) . 
 = = Training camp and practice facility = = 
 When the franchise was based in Dallas , the team conducted their inaugural training camp at the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell , New Mexico . They moved camp to Southern Methodist University , owner Lamar Hunt 's alma mater , for 1961 and continued to practice there until 1965 . From 1966 to 1971 , the Chiefs practiced in Swope Park in Kansas City , and from 1972 to 1991 held camp at William Jewell College in Clay County , Missouri – where Lamar Hunt had extensive business dealings including Worlds of Fun , Oceans of Fun and <unk> . 
 From 1991 to 2009 the Chiefs conducted summer training camp at the University of Wisconsin – River Falls in River Falls , Wisconsin . The Chiefs ' 2007 training camp was documented in the HBO / NFL Films documentary reality television series , Hard Knocks . Following the passage of a $ 25 million state tax credit proposal , the Chiefs moved their training camp to Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph , Missouri , in 2010 . The bulk of the tax credits went for improvements to Arrowhead Stadium with $ 10 million applied to the move to Missouri Western . A climate @-@ controlled , 120 @-@ yard NFL regulation grass indoor field , and office space for the Chiefs was constructed at Missouri Western adjacent to the school 's Spratt Stadium before the 2010 season . 
 Outside of training camp and during the regular season , the Chiefs conduct practices at their own training facility nearby Arrowhead Stadium . The facility is located near the Raytown Road entrance to the Truman Sports Complex just east of Interstate 435 and features three outdoor fields ( two grass and one artificial turf ) as well as an indoor facility with its own full @-@ size field . 
 = = Mascots and cheerleaders = = 
 The Chiefs ' first mascot was Warpaint , a nickname given to several different breeds of pinto horse . Warpaint served as the team 's mascot from 1963 to 1988 . The first Warpaint ( born in 1955 , died in 1992 ) was ridden bareback by rider Bob Johnson who wore a full Native American headdress . Warpaint circled the field at the beginning of each Chiefs home game and performed victory laps following each Chiefs touchdown . On September 20 , 2009 , a new Warpaint horse was unveiled at the Chiefs ' home opener against the Oakland Raiders . Warpaint is now ridden by a cheerleader , Susie . 
 In the mid @-@ 1980s , the Chiefs featured a short @-@ lived unnamed " Indian man " mascot which was later scrapped in 1988 . Since 1989 the cartoon @-@ like K. C. Wolf , portrayed by Dan Meers in a wolf costume , has served as the team 's mascot . The mascot was named after the Chiefs ' " Wolfpack , " a group of rabid fans from the team 's days at Municipal Stadium . K. C. Wolf is one of the most popular NFL mascots and was the league 's first mascot inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006 . 
 The Chiefs have employed a cheerleading squad since the team 's inception in 1960 . In the team 's early days , the all @-@ female squad was referred to as the <unk> . In addition to the Cheerleaders , in the early 1970s , there was also a dance / drill team that performed for pre @-@ game and halftime . From 1986 to 1992 , the cheerleader squad featured a mix of men and women . Since 1993 , the all @-@ female squad has been known as the Chiefs Cheerleaders .

 The Chiefs are one of 16 organizations that honor their players , coaches and contributors with a team Hall of Fame or Ring of Honor .

Several of the names were featured at Arrowhead Stadium in the stadium 's architecture prior to renovations in 2009 . The requirements for induction are that a player , coach , or contributor must have been with the Chiefs for four seasons and been out of the NFL for four seasons at the time of induction . There are some exceptions , such as Joe Delaney and Derrick Thomas , Delaney was with the team for only two seasons before his death , Thomas was inducted 1 year after his death in January 2000 ( 2 years after his final season ) . The Chiefs have the second @-@ most enshrinees of any NFL team in their team hall of fame behind the Green Bay Packers , who have enshrined over 100 players and team contributors over the years in the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame .

Hunt purchased the franchise for $ 25 @,@ 000 in 1960 and remained the team 's owner until his death in 2006 . The Hunt family kept ownership of the team following Lamar 's death and Clark Hunt , Lamar 's son , represents the family 's interests . While Hunt 's official title is Chairman of the Board , he serves as the franchise 's de facto owner . In 2010 , Hunt assumed role as CEO alongside his role as Chairman of the Board . According to Forbes , the team is valued at just under $ 1 billion and ranks 20th among NFL teams in 2010 . 
 Owner Lamar Hunt served as the team 's president from 1960 to 1976 . Because of Lamar Hunt 's contributions to the NFL , the AFC Championship trophy is named after him . He promoted general manager Jack Steadman to become the team 's president in 1977 . Steadman held the job until Carl Peterson was hired by Hunt in 1988 to replace him . Peterson resigned the title as team president in 2008 . Denny Thum became the team 's interim president following Peterson 's departure and was officially given the full position in May 2009 . Thum resigned from his position on September 14 , 2010 . 
 Don Rossi served as the team 's general manager for half of the 1960 season , resigning in November 1960 . Jack Steadman assumed duties from Rossi and served in the position until 1976 . Steadman was promoted to team president in 1976 and despite being relieved of those duties in 1988 , he remained with the franchise until 2006 in various positions . Jim Schaaf took over for Steadman as general manager until being fired in December 1988 . Carl Peterson was hired in 1988 to serve as the team 's general manager , chief executive officer and team president . Peterson remained in the position for 19 years until he announced his resignation from the team in 2008 . Denny Thum served as interim general manager until January 13 , 2009 , when the Chiefs named New England Patriots executive Scott Pioli the team 's new general manager . Pioli was released in early January after the hiring of Andy Reid , and was replaced by John Dorsey . Pioli 's record as the Chief 's general manager was 23 – 41 .

 The Chiefs boast one of the most loyal fan bases in the NFL .

The Chiefs averaged 77 @,@ 300 fans per game from 1996 to 2006 , second in the NFL behind the Washington Redskins . The franchise has an official fan club called Chiefs Kingdom which gives members opportunities to ticket priority benefits and VIP treatment . 
 At the end of " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " before home games , many Chiefs fans intentionally yell out " <unk> ! " rather than singing " brave " as the final word . In 1996 , general manager Carl Peterson said " We all look forward , not only at Arrowhead , but on the road , too , to when we get to that stanza of the National Anthem ... Our players love it . " After the September 11 , 2001 attacks , Chiefs fans refrained from doing so in honor of those who lost their lives in the tragedy and continued to do so for the remainder of the 2001 season . At the Chiefs ' September 23 , 2001 , home game against the New York Giants , fans gave the opposing Giants a standing ovation . 
 After every Chiefs touchdown at home games , fans chant while pointing in the direction of the visiting team and fans , " We 're gonna beat the hell outta you ... you ... you , you , you , you ! " over the song " Rock and Roll Part 2 . " The chant starts after the third " hey ! " in the song . The original version of the song by Gary Glitter was previously used until the NFL banned his music from its facilities in 2006 following the British rocker 's conviction on sexual abuse charges in Vietnam . A cover version of the song played by Tube Tops 2000 has been played since 2006 at every home game . Chiefs fans also occasionally carry on a tradition that began at Florida State University in the mid 1980s by using the Seminole <unk> as a rallying cry during key moments in their football games . 
 The Chiefs ' fan base has expanded across the world like many other NFL teams . However , there is a Twitter account dedicated to Chiefs fans in the UK and has been recognized by the Kansas City Chiefs and is their official UK fan page .

 Jean de Florette ( French pronunciation : ​ [ ʒɑ ̃ də <unk> ] ) is a 1986 French period drama film directed by Claude Berri , based on a novel by Marcel Pagnol . It is followed by Manon des Sources . The film takes place in rural Provence , where two local farmers scheme to trick a newcomer out of his newly inherited property . The film starred three of France 's most prominent actors – Gérard Depardieu , Daniel Auteuil , who won a BAFTA award for his performance , and Yves Montand in one of the last roles before his death . 
 The film was shot , together with Manon des Sources , over a period of seven months . At the time the most expensive French film ever made , it was a great commercial and critical success , both domestically and internationally , and was nominated for eight César awards , and ten BAFTAs . The two films helped promote Provence as a tourist destination . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The story takes place in a small village in Provence , France , shortly after the First World War . Ugolin Soubeyran ( Auteuil ) returns early in the morning from his military service , and wakes up his uncle César — known as ' Le Papet ' ( Montand ) . Ugolin stays only briefly to talk , as he is eager to get to his own place farther up in the mountains . Here he throws himself into a project that — at first — he keeps secret from Papet . He eventually reveals that the project consists of growing carnations . Papet is at first skeptical , but he is convinced when the flowers get a high price at the local market . They decide the project is worthy of expansion , and together they go to see the local farmer Pique @-@ Bouffigue , to buy his land . 
 The land in question is apparently " dry " , but Papet knows of a source of water , a spring , that can solve that problem . The neighbour does not want to sell , and an altercation breaks out when he insults the Soubeyran family . In the fight Pique @-@ Bouffigue is killed , but rather than feeling remorse , Papet sees this as an opportunity . After the funeral , they dig out the rubble that is blocking the spring , plug the hole , and cover it with cement and then earth . Unknown to them , they are seen blocking the spring by a poacher inside the house . 
 The property descends to the dead man 's sister , Florette de <unk> , a childhood friend of Papet ; who married the blacksmith in another village , Crespin , whilst Papet was recovering in a military Hospital in Africa . He writes to <unk> — a common friend — for news on Florette , and finds that she died the same day his letter arrived . The property thereby descends to her son Jean , who is a tax collector and " unfortunately , by God 's will ... he 's a hunchback " . To discourage the new owner from taking up residence , Ugolin breaks many tiles on the roof of the residence . 
 Florette 's son ( Depardieu ) arrives with his wife Aimée and young daughter Manon , and Soubeyran 's hopes of an easy takeover are soon shattered . The new owner is called Jean Cadoret , but Ugolin , in the local custom , calls him Jean de Florette . Jean makes it clear that he has no intention of selling , but plans to take up residence and live off the land . He has a grand scheme for making the farm profitable within two years , involving breeding rabbits and feeding them off cucurbit . Jean does not know about the nearby spring , but he knows of another , more distant spring ; and the house has a cistern that can supply some water for irrigating crops . The distant spring , where an old Italian couple lives , is 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) away and also part of the property . Jean believes the needs of the farm can be met from here . Ugolin is discouraged , but Papet tells him to befriend Jean and gain his confidence . They also keep secret from him the fact that — while average rainfall for the surrounding region is sustainable — the area where Florette 's farm lies rarely gets any of this rain . Meanwhile , the two work to turn the local community against the newcomer , who is described merely as a former tax collector from Crespin , as the deceased Pique @-@ Bouffigue has distant cousins living in the village who know about the spring . 
 Jean initially makes progress , and earns a small profit from his rabbit farm . In the long run , getting water proves a problem , and dragging it all the way from the distant spring becomes a backbreaking experience . Jean asks to borrow Ugolin 's mule , but is met only with vague excuses . Then , when the rain does come , it falls on the surrounding area but not where it is needed . Jean loudly berates God , whom he thinks has already given him enough trouble by making him a hunchback . Later , the dusty winds of the Sirocco also arrive , bringing the farm to near @-@ catastrophe . Jean is undeterred , and decides to dig a well . At this point Ugolin sees it fitting to try and convince Jean that his project is hopeless , and that he might be better off selling . Jean asks how much he could expect to receive for the farm , and Ugolin gives an estimate of around 8 @,@ 000 francs . Jean has no intention of leaving though , but wants to use the value of the property to take up a mortgage of half that sum . Ugolin is not happy , but Papet again sees opportunity : he will himself grant the mortgage ; that way he will either earn the interest , or drive Jean away for good . From the money Jean buys dynamite to finish the well , but an accident occurs , and he is hit by a rock and falls into the dynamite hole . At first the injuries seem minor , but it turns out the rock fractured his spine , and when the doctor arrives he declares Jean dead . Ugolin returns with the news to Papet , who asks him why he 's crying . " It is not me who 's crying , " he responds , " it 's my eyes " . 
 Aimée and Manon are now forced to leave the farm , and Papet offers to buy them out . As the mother and daughter are packing their belongings , Papet and Ugolin make their way to where they blocked the spring , to pull out the plug . Manon follows them , and when she sees what the two are doing , understands and gives out a shriek . The men hear it , but quickly dismiss the sound as that of a buzzard making a kill . As Papet performs a mock baptism of his nephew in the cold water of the spring , the film ends with the caption " end of part one " . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Yves Montand as César Soubeyran / " Le Papet " : In the local dialect " Papet " is an affectionate term for " grandfather " . César is the proud patriarch of a dying family , and his only known relative is his nephew Ugolin . Eager to restore his family 's position , he manipulates his nephew to do his bidding . For Yves Montand the filming experience was particularly trying because his wife of thirty @-@ three years , Simone Signoret , died during filming . Montand himself died in 1991 , and the two films were among the last of a cinematic career spanning forty @-@ five years . Having grown up in nearby Marseilles , he visited the location before filming started , and endeared himself with the locals . 
 Daniel Auteuil as Ugolin : Ugolin is César 's " rat @-@ faced sub @-@ intelligent nephew " . Somewhat more conscientious than his uncle , he is nevertheless persuaded to carry through with the diabolical plan . Auteuil used a prosthetic nose to make the character uglier . The role represented a great change for Auteuil . He had previously tended to play " smart , funny , urban hipster types " , and the role as Ugolin – which earned him both a BAFTA and a César – was a great step forward in his career . 
 Gérard Depardieu as Jean Cadoret / " Jean de Florette " : Jean is a city man with a romantic idea of the countryside , yet obstinate and hard @-@ working . Depardieu was well established as a versatile actor even before this role . Seemingly impervious to the great pressure on the film crew , he earned a reputation on the set for " fooling about , telling jokes , swearing at planes interrupting the shot and never knowing his lines until the camera was rolling " .

 Marcel Pagnol 's 1953 film Manon des Sources was four hours long , and subsequently cut by its distributor . The end result left Pagnol dissatisfied , and led him to retell the story as a novel . The first part of the novel , titled Jean de Florette , was an exploration of the background for the film ; a prequel of sorts . Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called L <unk> des <unk> ( The Water of the Hills ) . Berri came across Pagnol 's book by chance in a hotel room , and was captivated by it . He decided that in order to do the story justice it had to be made in two parts . 
 Jean de Florette was filmed in and around the Vaucluse department of Provence , where a number of different places have been mentioned as filming locations . La <unk> , east of Marseille , in the Bouches @-@ du @-@ Rhône department , was the village where Pagnol had shot the original film . The village is now within the city limits of Marseille and has undergone extensive development since the 1950s , so Berri had to find alternatives . For the village of the story he settled on Mirabeau ( 65 km to the north ) , while Jean de Florette 's house is located in <unk> , where the church from the film can also be found . The market scenes were filmed in <unk> in the Gard , and the story 's Les <unk> was in reality <unk> in the Var . 
 Extensive work was put into creating a genuine and historically correct atmosphere for the film . The facades of the houses of Mirabeau had to be replaced with painted polystyrene , to make them look older , and all electric wires were put underground . Meanwhile , in <unk> , Berri planted a dozen olive trees twelve months before filming started , and watered them throughout the waiting period , and for the second installment planted 10 @,@ 000 carnations on the farm . 
 Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources were filmed together , over a period of thirty weeks , from May to December 1985 . This allowed Berri to show the dramatic seasonal changes of the Provençal landscape . At $ 17 million , it was at the time the most expensive film project in French history . The long filming period and the constantly increasing cost put a great burden on the actors , many of whom frequently had to return to Paris for television or theatre work . Once completed , the release of the film was a great national event . A special promotional screening before the film 's official release 27 August 1986 , was attended by then Minister of Culture Jack Lang . The musical score is based around the aria <unk> Alvaro from Giuseppe Verdi 's 1862 opera La forza del destino . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The film was a great success in its native France , where it was seen by over seven million people . It also performed very well internationally ; in the United States it grossed nearly five million US $ , placing it among the 100 most commercially successful foreign @-@ language films shown there . 
 Critical reception for Jean de Florette was almost universally positive . Rita Kempley , writing for The Washington Post , compared the story to the fiction of William Faulkner . Allowing that it could indeed be " a definitive French masterwork " , she reserved judgement until after the premiere of the second part , as Jean de Florette was only a " half @-@ movie " , " a long , <unk> buildup , a pedantically paced tease " . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times commented on Berri 's exploration of human character , " the relentlessness of human greed , the feeling that the land is so important the human spirit can be sacrificed to it " . Ebert gave the film three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of four stars . 
 The staff reviewer for the entertainment magazine Variety highlighted – as other reviewers did as well – the cinematography of Bruno Nuytten ( an effort that won Nuytten a BAFTA award and a César nomination ) . The reviewer commended Berri particularly for the work done with the small cast , and for his decision to stay true to Pagnol 's original story . Richard Bernstein , reviewing the film for The New York Times , wrote it was " like no other film you 've seen in recent years " . He called it an updated , faster @-@ paced version of Pagnol , where the original was still recognisable . The newspaper lists the film among the " Best 1000 Movies Ever Made " . Later reviews show that the film has stood up to the passage of time . Tasha Robinson , reviewing the DVD release of the two films for The A.V. Club in 2007 , called the landscape , as portrayed by Berri and Nuytten , " almost unbearably beautiful " . Grading the films ' A ' , she called them " surprisingly tight and limber " for a four @-@ hour film cycle .

 Nominated for a total of eight César awards in 1987 – including ' Best Film ' , ' Best Director ' and ' Best Cinematography ' – Jean de Florette won only one , ' Best Actor ' for Daniel Auteuil . At the BAFTA awards the next year it fared better , winning awards for ' Best Actor in a Supporting Role ' ( Auteuil ) , ' Best Cinematography ' , ' Best Film ' and ' Best Adapted Screenplay ' . The film also earned six more nominations , including both Depardieu and Montand in the ' Best Actor ' <unk> , as well as ' Best Direction ' and ' Best Foreign Language Film ' . Amongst other honours for the film were a U.S. National Board of Review award for ' Best Foreign Language Film ' , and a ' Best Foreign Language Film ' nomination at the 1988 Golden Globes . It was also nominated for the Golden Prize at the 15th Moscow International Film Festival . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources have been interpreted as part of a wider trend in the 1980s of so @-@ called ' heritage cinema ' : period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history , culture and landscape of France . It was the official policy of President François Mitterrand , elected in 1981 , and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang , to promote these kinds of films through increased funding of the ailing French film industry . Berri 's pair of films stand as the most prominent example of this effort . It has also been suggested that the treatment given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was symbolic of the growing popularity of the anti @-@ immigration movement , led by politicians like Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen . 
 The two films are often seen in conjunction with Peter <unk> 's book A Year in Provence , as causing increased interest in , and tourism to , the region of Provence , particularly among the British . The films inspired a vision of the area as a place of rural authenticity , and were followed by an increase in British home ownership in southern France . As late as 2005 , the owners of the house belonging to Jean de Florette in the movie were still troubled by tourists trespassing on their property .

 = Texas annexation = 
 The Texas annexation was the 1845 incorporation of the Republic of Texas into the United States of America , which was admitted to the Union as the 28th state on December 29 , 1845 . 
 The Republic of Texas declared independence from the Republic of Mexico on March 2 , 1836 . At the time the vast majority of the Texian population favored the annexation of the Republic by the United States . The leadership of both major American political parties , the Democrats and the Whigs , opposed the introduction of Texas , a vast slave @-@ holding region , into the volatile political climate of the pro- and anti @-@ slavery sectional controversies in Congress . Moreover , they wished to avoid a war with Mexico , whose government refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of its rebellious northern province . With Texas 's economic fortunes declining by the early 1840s , the President of the Texas Republic , Sam Houston , arranged talks with Mexico to explore the possibility of securing official recognition of independence , with Great Britain mediating . 
 In 1843 , U.S. President John Tyler , unaligned with any political party , decided independently to pursue the annexation of Texas in a bid to gain a base of popular support for another four years in office . His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas , which would undermine slavery in the United States . Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration , Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844 . When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification , the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844 . Pro @-@ Texas @-@ annexation southern Democratic delegates denied their anti @-@ annexation leader Martin Van Buren the nomination at their party 's convention in May 1844 . In alliance with pro @-@ expansion northern Democratic colleagues , they secured the nomination of James K. Polk , who ran on a pro @-@ Texas Manifest Destiny platform . 
 In June 1844 , the Senate , with its Whig majority , soundly rejected the Tyler – Texas treaty . The pro @-@ annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti @-@ annexation Whig Henry Clay in the November 1844 presidential election . In December 1844 , lame @-@ duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by simple majorities in each house . The Democratic @-@ dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro @-@ slavery provisions of the Tyler treaty . The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill ( by the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs ) , designed to provide the incoming President @-@ elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House @-@ amended bill . 
 On March 1 , 1845 , President Tyler signed the annexation bill , and on March 3 ( his last day in office ) , he forwarded the House version to Texas , offering immediate annexation ( which preempted Polk ) . When Polk took office the next day , he encouraged Texas to accept the Tyler offer . Texas ratified the agreement with popular approval from Texans . The bill was signed by Polk on December 29 , 1845 , accepting Texas as the 28th state of the Union . Texas formally relinquished its sovereignty to the United States on February 19 , 1846 .

 = = = U.S. Territorial expansion and Texas = = = 
 First mapped by Spain in 1519 , Texas was part of the Spanish empire for over 300 years . When the Louisiana territory was acquired by the United States from France in 1803 , many in the U.S. believed the new territory included parts or all of present @-@ day Texas . The US @-@ Spain border along the northern frontier of Texas took shape in the 1817 – 1819 negotiations between Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and the Spanish ambassador to the United States , Luis de Onís y González @-@ Vara . The boundaries of Texas were determined within the larger geostrategic struggle to demarcate the limits of the United States ' extensive western lands and of Spain 's vast possessions in North America . The Florida Treaty of February 22 , 1819 emerged as a compromise that excluded Spain from the lower Columbia River watershed , but established southern boundaries at the Sabine and Red Rivers , " legally extinguish [ ing ] " any American claims to Texas . Nonetheless , Texas remained an object of fervent interest to American expansionists , among them Thomas Jefferson , who anticipated the eventual acquisition of its fertile lands . 
 The Missouri crisis of 1819 – 1821 sharpened commitments to expansionism among the country 's slaveholding interests , when the so @-@ called Thomas proviso established the 36 ° 30 ' parallel , imposing free @-@ soil and slave @-@ soil futures in the Louisiana Purchase lands . While a majority of southern congressmen acquiesced to the exclusion of slavery from the bulk of the Louisiana Purchase , a significant minority objected . Virginian editor Thomas Ritchie of the Richmond Enquirer predicted that with the proviso restrictions , the South would ultimately require Texas : " If we are cooped up on the north , we must have elbow room to the west . " Representative John Floyd of Virginia in 1824 accused Secretary of State Adams of conceding Texas to Spain in 1819 in the interests of Northern anti @-@ slavery advocates , and so depriving the South of additional slave states . Then @-@ Representative John Tyler of Virginia invoked the Jeffersonian precepts of territorial and commercial growth as a national goal to counter the rise of sectional differences over slavery . His " diffusion " theory declared that with Missouri open to slavery , the new state would encourage the transfer of underutilized slaves westward , emptying the eastern states of bondsmen and making emancipation feasible in the old South . This doctrine would be revived during the Texas annexation controversy . 
 When Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821 , the United States did not contest the new republic 's claims to Texas , and both presidents John Quincy Adams ( 1825 – 1829 ) and Andrew Jackson ( 1829 – 1837 ) persistently sought , through official and unofficial channels , to procure all or portions of provincial Texas from the Mexican government , without success . 
 = = = Texas settlement and independence = = = 
 Anglo @-@ American immigrants , primarily from the Southern United States , began emigrating to Mexican Texas in the early 1820s at the invitation of the Mexican government , which sought to populate the sparsely inhabited lands of its northern frontier . <unk> empresario Stephen F. Austin managed the regional affairs of the mostly American @-@ born population – 20 % of them slaves – under the terms of the generous government land grants . Mexican authorities were initially content to govern the remote province through salutary neglect , " permitting slavery under the legal fiction of ' permanent indentured servitude ' , similar to Mexico 's peonage system . 
 A general lawlessness prevailed in the vast Texas frontier , and Mexico 's civic laws went largely unenforced . Mexican authorities , perceiving that they were losing control over Texas and alarmed by the unsuccessful Fredonian Rebellion of 1826 , abandoned the policy of benign rule . New restrictions were imposed in 1829 – 1830 , outlawing slavery throughout the nation and terminating further American immigration to Texas . Military occupation followed , sparking local uprisings and a civil war . Texas conventions in 1832 and 1833 submitted petitions for redress of grievances to overturn the restrictions , with limited success . In 1835 , an army under Mexican President Santa Anna entered its territory of Texas and abolished self @-@ government . Texans responded by declaring their independence from Mexico on March 2 , 1836 . On April 20 – 21 , rebel forces under Texas General Sam Houston defeated the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto . In June 1836 , Santa Anna agreed to Texas independence , but the Mexican government refused to honor Santa Anna 's pledge . Texans , now de facto independent , recognized that their security and prosperity could never be achieved while Mexico denied the legitimacy of their revolution . 
 In the years following independence , the migration of white settlers and importation of black slave labor into the vast republic was deterred by Texas 's unresolved international status and the threat of renewed warfare with Mexico . American citizens who considered migrating to the new republic perceived that " life and property were safer within the United States " than in an independent Texas . The situation led to labor shortages , reduced tax revenue , large national debts and a diminished Texas militia .

 The Anglo @-@ American immigrants residing in newly @-@ independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States . But , despite his strong support for Texas independence from Mexico , then @-@ President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing the new republic until the last day of his presidency to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election . Jackson 's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states and undermine the North @-@ South balance in Congress . 
 Jackson 's successor , President Martin Van Buren , viewed Texas annexation as an immense political liability that would empower the anti @-@ slavery northern Whig opposition – especially if annexation provoked a war with Mexico . Presented with a formal annexation proposal from Texas minister <unk> Hunt , Jr. in August 1837 , Van Buren summarily rejected it . Annexation resolutions presented separately in each house of Congress were either soundly defeated or tabled through filibuster . After the election of 1838 , new Texas president Mirabeau B. Lamar withdrew his republic 's offer of annexation due to these failures . Texans were at an annexation impasse when John Tyler entered the White House in 1841 .

 In his first address to Congress in special session on June 1 , 1841 , Tyler set the stage for Texas annexation by announcing his intention to pursue an expansionist agenda so as to preserve the balance between state and national authority and to protect American institutions , including slavery , so as to avoid sectional conflict . Tyler 's closest advisors counseled him that obtaining Texas would assure him a second term in the White House , and it became a deeply personal obsession for the president , who viewed the acquisition of Texas as the " primary objective of his administration " . Tyler delayed direct action on Texas to work closely with his Secretary of State Daniel Webster on other pressing diplomatic initiatives . 
 With the Webster @-@ Ashburton Treaty ratified in 1843 , Tyler was ready to make the annexation of Texas his " top priority " . Representative Thomas W. Gilmer of Virginia was authorized by the administration to make the case for annexation to the American electorate . In a widely circulated open letter , understood as an announcement of the executive branch 's designs for Texas , Gilmer described Texas as a panacea for North @-@ South conflict and an economic boon to all commercial interests . The slavery issue , however divisive , would be left for the states to decide as per the US Constitution . Domestic tranquility and national security , Tyler argued , would result from an annexed Texas ; a Texas left outside American jurisdiction would imperil the Union . Tyler adroitly arranged the resignation of his anti @-@ annexation Secretary of State Daniel Webster , and on June 23 , 1843 appointed Abel P. Upshur , a Virginia states ' rights champion and ardent proponent of Texas annexation . This cabinet shift signaled Tyler 's intent to pursue Texas annexation aggressively . 
 = = = Tyler – Upshur – Calhoun campaign for Texas = = = 
 In late September 1843 , in an effort to cultivate public support for Texas , Secretary Upshur dispatched a letter to the US Minister to Great Britain , Edward Everett , conveying his displeasure with Britain 's global anti @-@ slavery posture , and warning their government that forays into Texas 's affairs would be regarded as " tantamount to direct interference ' with the established institutions of the United States ' " . In a breach of diplomatic norms , Upshur leaked the communique to the press to inflame popular Anglophobic sentiments among American citizens . 
 In the spring of 1843 , the Tyler administration had sent executive agent Duff Green to Europe to gather intelligence and arrange territorial treaty talks with Great Britain regarding Oregon ; he also worked with American minister to France , Lewis Cass , to thwart efforts by major European powers to suppress the maritime slave trade . Green reported to Secretary Upshur in July 1843 the he had discovered a " loan plot " by American abolitionists , in league with Lord Aberdeen , British Foreign Secretary , to provide funds to the Texas in exchange for the emancipation of its slaves . Minister Everett was charged with determining the substance of these confidential reports alleging a Texas plot . His investigations , including personal interviews with Lord Aberdeen , concluded that British interest in abolitionist intrigues was weak , contradicting Secretary of State Upshur 's conviction that Great Britain was manipulating Texas . Though unsubstantiated , Green 's unofficial intelligence so alarmed Tyler that he requested verification from the US minister to Mexico , Waddy Thompson . 
 John C. Calhoun of South Carolina , a pro @-@ slavery extremist , counseled Secretary Upshur that British designs on American slavery were real and required immediate action to preempt a takeover of Texas by Great Britain . When Tyler confirmed in September that the British Foreign Secretary Aberdeen had encouraged détente between Mexico and Texas , allegedly pressing Mexico to maneuver Texas towards emancipation of its slaves , Tyler acted at once . On September 18 , 1843 , in consultation with Secretary Upshur , he ordered secret talks opened with Texas Minister to the United States Isaac Van Zandt to negotiate the annexation of Texas . Face @-@ to @-@ face negotiations commenced on October 16 , 1843 . 
 = = = = Texas – Mexico – Great Britain negotiations = = = = 
 By the summer of 1843 Sam Houston 's Texas administration had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government to consider a rapprochement that would permit Texas self @-@ governance , possibly as a state of Mexico , with Great Britain acting as mediator . Texas officials felt compelled by the fact that the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation . With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching , the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti @-@ Texas . Texas @-@ Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico 's borders , or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition . 
 Van Zandt , though he personally favored annexation by the United States , was not authorized to entertain any overtures from the US government on the subject . Texas officials were at the moment deeply engaged in exploring settlements with Mexican diplomats , facilitated by Great Britain . Texas 's predominant concern was not British interference with the institution of slavery – English diplomats had not alluded to the issue – but the avoidance of any resumption of hostilities with Mexico . Still , US Secretary of State Upshur vigorously courted Texas diplomats to begin annexation talks , finally dispatching an appeal to President Sam Houston in January 1845 . In it , he assured Houston that , in contrast to previous attempts , the political climate in the United States , including sections of the North , was amenable to Texas statehood , and that a two @-@ thirds majority in Senate could be obtained to ratify a Texas treaty . 
 Texans were hesitant to pursue a US @-@ Texas treaty without a written commitment of military defense from America , since a full @-@ scale military attack by Mexico seemed likely when the negotiations became public . If ratification of the annexation measure stalled in the US Senate , Texas could face a war alone against Mexico . Because only Congress could declare war , the Tyler administration lacked the constitutional authority to commit the US to support of Texas . But when Secretary Upshur provided a verbal assurance of military defense , President Houston , responding to urgent calls for annexation from the Texas Congress of December 1843 , authorized the reopening of annexation negotiations . 
 = = = The US – Texas treaty negotiations = = = 
 As Secretary Upshur accelerated the secret treaty discussions , Mexican diplomats learned that US @-@ Texas talks were taking place . Mexican minister to the U.S. Juan Almonte confronted Upshur with these reports , warning him that if Congress sanctioned a treaty of annexation , Mexico would break diplomatic ties and immediately declare war . Secretary Upshur evaded and dismissed the charges , and pressed forward with the negotiations . In tandem with moving forward with Texas diplomats , Upshur was secretly lobbying US Senators to support annexation , providing lawmakers with persuasive arguments linking Texas acquisition to national security and domestic peace . By early 1844 , Upshur was able to assure Texas officials that 40 of the 52 members of the Senate were pledged to ratify the Tyler @-@ Texas treaty , more than the two @-@ thirds majority required for passage . Tyler , in his annual address to Congress in December 1843 , maintained his silence on the secret treaty , so as not to damage relations with the wary Texas diplomats . Throughout , Tyler did his utmost to keep the negotiations secret , making no public reference to his administration 's single @-@ minded quest for Texas . 
 The Tyler @-@ Texas treaty was in its final stages when its chief architects , Secretary Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas W. Gilmer , died in an accident aboard USS Princeton on February 28 , 1844 , just a day after achieving a preliminary treaty draft agreement with the Texas Republic . The Princeton disaster proved a major setback for Texas annexation , in that Tyler expected Secretary Upshur to elicit critical support from Whig and Democratic Senators during the upcoming treaty ratification process . Tyler selected John C. Calhoun to replace Upshur as Secretary of State and to finalize the treaty with Texas . The choice of Calhoun , a highly regarded but controversial American statesman , risked introducing a politically polarizing element into the Texas debates , but Tyler prized him as a strong advocate of annexation . 
 = = = = Robert J. Walker and the " safety @-@ valve " = = = = 
 With the Tyler @-@ Upshur secret annexation negotiations with Texas near consummation , Senator Robert J. Walker of Mississippi , a key Tyler ally , issued a widely distributed and highly influential letter , reproduced as a pamphlet , making the case for immediate annexation . In it , Walker argued that Texas could be acquired by Congress in a number of ways – all constitutional – and that the moral authority to do so was based on the precepts for territorial expansion established by Jefferson and Madison , and promulgated as doctrine by Monroe in 1823 . Senator Walker 's polemic offered analysis on the significance of Texas with respect to slavery and race . He envisioned Texas as a corridor through which both free and enslaved African @-@ Americans could be " diffused " southward in a gradual exodus that would ultimately supply labor to the Central American tropics , and in time , empty the United States of its slave population . 
 This " safety @-@ valve " theory " appealed to the racial fears of northern whites " who dreaded the prospect of absorbing emancipated slaves into their communities in the event that the institution of slavery collapsed in the South . This scheme for racial cleansing was consistent , on a pragmatic level , with proposals for overseas colonization of blacks , which were pursued by a number of American presidents , from Jefferson to Lincoln . Walker bolstered his position by raising national security concerns , warning that in the event annexation failed , imperialist Great Britain would maneuver the Republic of Texas into emancipating its slaves , forecasting a dangerous destabilizing influence on southwestern slaveholding states . The pamphlet characterized abolitionists as traitors who conspired with the British to overthrow the United States . 
 A variation of the Tyler 's " diffusion " theory , it played on economic fears in a period when slave @-@ based staple crop markets had not yet recovered from the Panic of 1837 . The Texas " escape route " conceived by Walker promised to increase demand for slaves in fertile cotton @-@ growing regions of Texas , as well as the monetary value of slaves . Cash @-@ poor plantation owners in the older eastern South were promised a market for surplus slaves at a profit . Texas annexation , wrote Walker , would eliminate all these dangers and " fortify the whole Union . " 
 Walker 's pamphlet brought forth strident demands for Texas from pro @-@ slavery expansionists in the South ; in the North , it allowed anti @-@ slavery expansionists to embrace Texas without appearing to be aligned with pro @-@ slavery extremists . His assumptions and analysis " shaped and framed the debates on annexation but his premises went largely unchallenged among the press and public . 
 = = Tyler @-@ Texas treaty and the election of 1844 = = 
 The Tyler @-@ Texas treaty , signed on April 12 , 1844 , was framed to induct Texas into the Union as a territory , following constitutional protocols . To wit , Texas would cede all its public lands to the United States , and the federal government would assume all its bonded debt , up to $ 10 million . The boundaries of the Texas territory were left unspecified . Four new states could ultimately be carved from the former republic – three of them likely to become slave states . Any allusion to slavery was omitted from the document so as not to antagonize anti @-@ slavery sentiments during Senate debates , but it provided for the " preservation of all [ Texas ] property as secured in our domestic institutions . " 
 Upon the signing of the treaty , Tyler complied with the Texans ' demand for military and naval protection , deploying troops to Fort Jesup in Louisiana and a fleet of warships to the Gulf of Mexico . In the event that the Senate failed to pass the treaty , Tyler promised the Texas diplomats that he would officially exhort both houses of Congress to establish Texas as a state of the Union upon provisions authorized in the Constitution . Tyler 's cabinet was split on the administration 's handling of the Texas agreement . Secretary of War William Wilkins praised the terms of annexation publicly , touting the economic and geostrategic benefits with relation to Great Britain . Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer was alarmed at the constitutional implications of Tyler 's application of military force without congressional approval , a violation of the separation of powers . Refusing to transfer contingency funds for the naval mobilization , he resigned . 
 Tyler submitted his treaty for annexation to the Senate , delivered April 22 , 1844 , where a two @-@ thirds majority was required for ratification . Secretary of State Calhoun ( assuming his post March 29 , 1844 ) had sent a letter to British minister Richard Packenham denouncing British anti @-@ slavery interference in Texas . He included the Packenham Letter with the Tyler bill , intending to create a sense of crisis in Southern Democrats . In it , he characterized slavery as a social blessing and the acquisition of Texas as an emergency measure necessary to safeguard the " peculiar institution " in the United States . In doing so , Tyler and Calhoun sought to unite the South in a crusade that would present the North with an ultimatum : support Texas annexation or lose the South . 
 = = = Tyler and the Polk presidential nomination = = = 
 President Tyler expected that his treaty would be debated secretly in Senate executive session . However , less than a week after debates opened , the treaty , its associated internal correspondence , and the Packenham letter were leaked to the public . The nature of the Tyler @-@ Texas negotiations caused a national outcry , in that " the documents appeared to verify that the sole objective of Texas annexation was the preservation of slavery . " A mobilization of anti @-@ annexation forces in the North strengthened both major parties ' hostility toward Tyler 's agenda . The leading presidential hopefuls of both parties , Democrat Martin Van Buren and Whig Henry Clay , publicly denounced the treaty . Texas annexation and the reoccupation of Oregon territory emerged as the central issues in the 1844 general election . 
 In response , Tyler , already ejected from the Whig party , quickly began to organize a third party in hopes of inducing the Democrats to embrace a pro @-@ expansionist platform . By running as a third @-@ party candidate , Tyler threatened to siphon off pro @-@ annexation Democratic voters ; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay , a staunchly anti @-@ Texas Whig . Pro @-@ annexation delegates among southern Democrats , with assistance from a number of northern delegates , blocked anti @-@ expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention , which instead nominated the pro @-@ expansion champion of Manifest Destiny , James K. Polk of Tennessee . Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition . 
 In August 1844 , in the midst of the campaign , Tyler withdrew from the race . The Democratic Party was by then unequivocally committed to Texas annexation , and Tyler , assured by Polk 's envoys that as President he would effect Texas annexation , urged his supporters to vote Democratic . Polk narrowly defeated Whig Henry Clay in the November election . The victorious Democrats were poised to acquire Texas under President @-@ elect Polk 's doctrine of Manifest Destiny , rather than on the pro @-@ slavery agenda of Tyler and Calhoun .

 As a treaty document with a foreign nation , the Tyler @-@ Texas annexation treaty required the support of a two @-@ thirds majority in the Senate for passage . But in fact , when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8 , 1844 , fully two @-@ thirds voted against the treaty ( 16 – 35 ) . The vote went largely along party lines : Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously ( 1 – 27 ) , while Democrats split , but voted overwhelmingly in favor ( 15 – 8 ) . The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats . Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail , due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun 's Packenham letter . Undeterred , he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty . Congress adjourned before debating the matter . 
 = = = Reintroduction as a joint resolution = = = 
 The same Senate that had rejected the Tyler – Calhoun treaty by a margin of 2 : 1 in June 1844 reassembled in December 1844 in a short lame @-@ duck session . ( Though pro @-@ annexation Democrats had made gains in the fall elections , those legislators – the 29th Congress – would not assume office until March 1845 . ) Lame @-@ duck President Tyler , still trying to annex Texas in the final months of his administration , wished to avoid another overwhelming Senate rejection of his treaty . In his annual address to Congress on December 4 , he declared the Polk victory a mandate for Texas annexation and proposed that Congress adopt a joint resolution procedure by which simple majorities in each house could secure ratification for the Tyler treaty . This method would avoid the constitutional requirement of a two @-@ thirds majority in the Senate . Bringing the House of Representatives into the equation boded well for Texas annexation , as the pro @-@ annexation Democratic Party possessed nearly a 2 : 1 majority in that chamber . 
 By <unk> the discredited treaty through a House @-@ sponsored bill , the Tyler administration reignited sectional hostilities over Texas admission . Both northern Democratic and southern Whig Congressmen had been bewildered by local political agitation in their home states during the 1844 presidential campaigns . Now , northern Democrats found themselves vulnerable to charges of appeasement of their southern wing if they capitulated to Tyler 's slavery expansion provisions . On the other hand , Manifest Destiny enthusiasm in the north placed politicians under pressure to admit Texas immediately to the Union . 
 Constitutional objections were raised in House debates as to whether both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize admission of territories , rather than states . Moreover , if the Republic of Texas , a nation in its own right , were admitted as a state , its territorial boundaries , property relations ( including slave property ) , debts and public lands would require a Senate @-@ ratified treaty . Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $ 10 million in Texas debt , resenting the deluge of speculators , who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill . House Democrats , at an impasse , relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs . 
 = = = Brown – Foster House amendment = = = 
 Anti @-@ Texas Whig legislators had lost more than the White House in the general election of 1844 . In the southern states of Tennessee and Georgia , Whig strongholds in the 1840 general election , voter support dropped precipitously due to the pro @-@ annexation excitement in the Deep South – and Clay lost every Deep South state to Polk . Northern Whigs ' uncompromising hostility to slavery expansion increasingly characterized the party , and southern members , by association , had suffered from charges of being " soft on Texas , therefore soft on slavery " by Southern Democrats . Facing congressional and gubernatorial races in 1845 in their home states , a number of Southern Whigs sought to erase that impression with respect to the Tyler @-@ Texas bill . 
 Southern Whigs in the Congress , including Representative Milton Brown and Senator Ephraim Foster , both of Tennessee , and Representative Alexander Stephens of Georgia collaborated to introduce a House amendment on January 13 , 1845 that was designed to enhance slaveowner gains in Texas beyond those offered by the Democratic @-@ sponsored Tyler @-@ Calhoun treaty bill . The legislation proposed to recognize Texas as a slave state which would retain all its vast public lands , as well as its bonded debt accrued since 1836 . Furthermore , the Brown amendment would delegate to the U.S. government responsibility for negotiating the disputed Texas @-@ Mexico boundary . The issue was a critical one , as the size of Texas would be immensely increased if the international border were set at the Rio Grande River , with its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains , rather than the traditionally recognized boundary at the Nueces River , 100 miles to the north . While the Tyler @-@ Calhoun treaty provided for the organization of a total of four states from the Texas lands – three likely to qualify as slave states – Brown 's plan would permit Texas state lawmakers to configure a total of five states from its western region , south of the 36 ° 30 ' Missouri Compromise line , each pre @-@ authorized to permit slavery upon statehood , if Texas designated them as such . 
 Politically , the Brown amendment was designed to portray Southern Whigs as " even more ardent champions of slavery and the South , than southern Democrats . " The bill also served to distinguish them from their northern Whig colleagues who cast the controversy , as Calhoun did , in strictly pro- versus anti @-@ slavery terms . While almost all Northern Whigs spurned Brown 's amendment , the Democrats quickly co @-@ opted the legislation , providing the votes necessary to attach the proviso to Tyler 's joint resolution , by a 118 – 101 vote . Southern Democrats supported the bill almost unanimously ( 59 – 1 ) , while Northern Democrats split strongly in favor ( 50 – 30 ) . Eight of eighteen Southern Whigs cast their votes in favor . Northern Whigs unanimously rejected it . The House proceeded to approve the amended Texas treaty 120 – 98 on January 25 , 1845 . The vote in the House had been one in which party affiliation prevailed over sectional allegiance . The bill was forwarded the same day to the Senate for debate . 
 = = = Benton Senate compromise = = = 
 By early February 1845 , when the Senate began to debate the Brown @-@ amended Tyler treaty , its passage seemed unlikely , as support was " perishing " . The partisan alignments in the Senate were near parity , 28 – 24 , slightly in favor of the Whigs . The Senate Democrats would require undivided support among their colleagues , and three or more Whigs who would be willing to cross party lines to pass the House @-@ amended treaty . The fact that Senator Foster had drafted the House amendment under consideration improved prospects of Senate passage . 
 Anti @-@ annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri had been the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler @-@ Texas measure in June 1844 . His original proposal for an annexed Texas had embodied a national compromise , whereby Texas would be divided in two , half slave @-@ soil and half free @-@ soil . As pro @-@ annexation sentiment grew in his home state , Benton retreated from this compromise offer . By February 5 , 1845 , in the early debates on the Brown @-@ amended House bill , he advanced an alternative resolution that , unlike the Brown scenario , made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free @-@ slave apportionment of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic 's acquisition by the United States . 
 The Benton proposal was intended to calm northern anti @-@ slavery Democrats ( who wished to eliminate the Tyler @-@ Calhoun treaty altogether , as it had been negotiated on behalf of the slavery expansionists ) , and allow the decision to devolve upon the soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ inaugurated Democratic President @-@ elect James K. Polk . President @-@ elect Polk had expressed his ardent wish that Texas annexation should be accomplished before he entered Washington in advance of his inauguration on March 4 , 1845 , the same day Congress would end its session . With his arrival in the capital , he discovered the Benton and Brown factions in the Senate " paralyzed " over the Texas annexation legislation . On the advice of his soon @-@ to @-@ be Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker , Polk urged Senate Democrats to unite under a dual resolution that would include both the Benton and Brown versions of annexation , leaving enactment of the legislation to Polk 's discretion when he took office . In private and separate talks with supporters of both the Brown and Benton plans , Polk left each side with the " impression he would administer their [ respective ] policy . Polk meant what he said to Southerners and meant to appear friendly to the Van <unk> faction . " Polk 's handling of the matter had the effect of uniting Senate northern Democrats in favor of the dual alternative treaty bill . 
 On February 27 , 1845 , less than a week before Polk 's inauguration , the Senate voted 27 – 25 to admit Texas , based on the Tyler protocols of simple majority passage . All twenty @-@ four Democrats voted for the measure , joined by three southern Whigs . Benton and his allies were assured that Polk would act to establish the eastern portion of Texas as a slave state ; the western section was to remain unorganized territory , not committed to slavery . On this understanding , the northern Democrats had conceded their votes for the dichotomous bill . The next day , in an almost strict party line vote , the Benton @-@ Milton measure was passed in the Democrat @-@ controlled House of Representatives . President Tyler signed the bill the following day , March 1 , 1845 ( Joint Resolution for annexing Texas to the United States , <unk> 8 , enacted March 1 , 1845 , 5 Stat . 797 ) . 
 = = Annexation and admittance = = 
 Senate and house legislators who had favored Benton 's renegotiated version of the Texas annexation bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure , but leave its implementation to the incoming Polk administration . But , during his last day in office , President Tyler , with the urging of his Secretary of State Calhoun , decided to act decisively to improve the odds for the immediate annexation of Texas . On March 3 , 1845 , with his cabinet 's assent , he dispatched an offer of annexation to the Republic of Texas by courier , exclusively under the terms of the Brown – Foster option of the joint house measure . Secretary Calhoun apprised President @-@ elect Polk of the action , who demurred without comment . Tyler justified his preemptive move on the grounds that Polk was likely to come under pressure to abandon immediate annexation and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative . 
 When President Polk took office on March 4 , he was in a position to recall Tyler 's dispatch to Texas and reverse his decision . On March 10 , after conferring with his cabinet , Polk upheld Tyler 's action and allowed the courier to proceed with the offer of immediate annexation to Texas . The only modification was to exhort Texans to accept the annexation terms unconditionally . Polk 's decision was based on his concern that a protracted negotiation by US commissioners would expose annexation efforts to foreign intrigue and interference . While Polk kept his annexation endeavors confidential , Senators passed a resolution requesting formal disclosure of the administration 's Texas policy . Polk stalled , and when the Senate special session had adjourned on March 20 , 1845 , no names for US commissioners to Texas had been submitted by him . Polk denied charges from Senator Benton that he had misled Benton on his intention to support the new negotiations option , declaring " if any such pledges were made , it was in a total misconception of what I said or meant . " 
 On May 5 , 1845 , Texas President Jones called for a convention on July 4 , 1845 , to consider the annexation and a constitution . On June 23 , the Texan Congress accepted the US Congress 's joint resolution of March 1 , 1845 , annexing Texas to the United States , and consented to the convention . On July 4 , the Texas convention debated the annexation offer and almost unanimously passed an ordinance assenting to it . The convention remained in session through August 28 , and adopted the Constitution of Texas on August 27 , 1845 . The citizens of Texas approved the annexation ordinance and new constitution on October 13 , 1845 . 
 President Polk signed the legislation making the former Lone Star Republic a state of the Union on December 29 , 1845 ( Joint Resolution for the admission of the state of Texas into the Union , <unk> 1 , enacted December 29 , 1845 , 9 Stat . 108 ) . Texas formally relinquished its sovereignty to the United States on February 14 , 1846 . 
 = = Joint resolution precedent and legacy : Hawaii = = 
 The formal controversy over the legality of the annexation of Texas stems from the fact that Congress approved the annexation of Texas as a state , rather than a territory , with simple majorities in each house , instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty , as was done with Native American lands . Tyler 's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts , but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill . The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii 's annexation in 1897 . 
 Republican President Benjamin Harrison ( 1889 – 1893 ) attempted , in 1893 , to annex Hawaii through a Senate treaty . When this failed , he was asked to consider the Tyler joint house precedent ; he declined . Democratic President Grover Cleveland ( 1893 – 1897 ) did not pursue the annexation of Hawaii . When President William McKinley took office in 1897 , he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists when he resubmitted legislation to acquire Hawaii . When the two @-@ thirds Senate support was not forthcoming , committees in the House and Senate explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the joint house resolution , which was successfully applied to approve the annexation of Hawaii in July 1898 . 
 = Forensic anthropology = 
 Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of anthropology and its various subfields , including forensic archaeology and forensic taphonomy , in a legal setting . A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed , burned , mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable , as might happen in a plane crash . Forensic anthropologists are also instrumental to the investigation and documentation of genocide and mass graves . Along with forensic pathologists , forensic dentists , and homicide investigators , forensic anthropologists commonly testify in court as expert witnesses . Using physical markers present on a skeleton , a forensic anthropologist can potentially determine a victim 's age , sex , stature , and ancestry . In addition to identifying physical characteristics of the individual , forensic anthropologists can use skeletal abnormalities to potentially determine cause of death , past trauma such as broken bones or medical procedures , as well as diseases such as bone cancer . 
 The methods used to identity a person from a skeleton relies on the past contributions of various anthropologists and the study of human skeletal differences . Through the collection of thousands of specimens and the analysis of differences within a population , estimations can be made based on physical characteristics . Through these , a set of remains can potentially be identified . The field of forensic anthropology grew during the twentieth century into a fully recognized forensic specialty involving trained anthropologists as well as numerous research institutions gathering data on decomposition and the effects it can have on the skeleton . 
 = = Modern uses = = 
 Today , forensic anthropology is a well established discipline within the forensic field . Anthropologists are called upon to investigate remains and to help identify individuals from bones when other physical characteristics which could be used to identify a body no longer exist . Forensic anthropologists work in conjunction with forensic pathologists to identify remains based on their skeletal characteristics . If the victim is not found for a lengthy period of time or has been eaten by scavengers , flesh markers used for identification would be destroyed , making normal identification difficult if not impossible . Forensic anthropologists can provide physical characteristics of the person to input into missing person databases such as that of the National Crime Information Center in the US or <unk> 's yellow notice database . 
 In addition to these duties , forensic anthropologists often assist in the investigation of war crimes and mass fatality investigations . Anthropologists have been tasked with helping to identify victims of the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks as well as plane crashes such as the Arrow Air Flight 1285 disaster and the USAir Flight 427 disaster where the flesh had been vaporized or so badly mangled that normal identification was impossible . Anthropologists have also helped identify victims of genocide in countries around the world , often long after the actual event . War crimes anthropologists have helped investigate include the Rwandan Genocide and the Srebrenica Genocide . Organizations such as the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe , the British Association for Forensic Anthropology , and the American Society of Forensic Anthropologists continue to provide guidelines for the improvement of forensic anthropology and the development of standards within the discipline . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The use of anthropology in the forensic investigation of remains grew out of the recognition of anthropology as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of physical anthropology . The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science during the early years of the twentieth century . Earnest Hooton pioneered the field of physical anthropology and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full @-@ time teaching position in the United States . He was an organizing committee member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists along with its founder Aleš <unk> . Hooton 's students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical anthropology during the early 20th century . In addition to physical anthropology , Hooton was a proponent of criminal anthropology . Now considered a pseudoscience , criminal anthropologists believed that phrenology and physiognomy could link a person 's behavior to specific physical characteristics . The use of criminal anthropology to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the eugenics movement , popular at the time . It is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of anthropometry and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by Alphonse Bertillon . The study of this information helped shape anthropologists ' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur . 
 Another prominent early anthropologist , Thomas Wingate Todd , was primarily responsible for the creation of the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912 . In total , Todd acquired 3 @,@ 300 human skulls and skeletons , 600 anthropoid skulls and skeletons , and 3 @,@ 000 mammalian skulls and skeletons . Todd 's contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding suture closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the mandible . Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the pubic symphysis . Though the standards have been updated , these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of skeletonized remains . These early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology , but it was not until the 1940s , with the help of Todd 's student , Wilton M. Krogman , that forensic anthropology gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline . 
 = = = The growth of forensic anthropology = = = 
 During the 1940s , Krogman was the first anthropologist to actively publicize anthropologists ' potential forensic value , going as far as placing advertisements in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin informing agencies of the ability of anthropologists to assist in the identification of skeletal remains . This period saw the first official use of anthropologists by federal agencies including the FBI . During the 1950s , the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps employed forensic anthropologists in the identification of war casualties during the Korean War . It was at this time that forensic anthropology officially began . The sudden influx of available skeletons for anthropologists to study , whose identities were eventually confirmed , allowed for the creation of more accurate formulas for the identification of sex , age , and stature based solely on skeletal characteristics . These formulas , developed in the 1940s and refined by war , are still in use by modern forensic anthropologists . 
 The professionalization of the field began soon after , during the 1950s and 1960s . This move coincided with the replacement of coroners with medical examiners in many locations around the country . It was during this time that the field of forensic anthropology gained recognition as a separate field within the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and the first forensic anthropology research facility and body farm was opened by William M. Bass . Public attention and interest in forensic anthropology began to increase around this time as forensic anthropologists started working on more high @-@ profile cases . One of the major cases of the era involved anthropologist Charles <unk> who helped identify the victims murdered by Ed Gein . 
 = = Methods = = 
 One of the main tools forensic anthropologists use in the identification of remains is their knowledge of osteology and the various differences that occur within the human skeleton . During the course of an investigation , anthropologists are often tasked with helping to determinate an individual 's sex , stature , age , and ancestry . To do this , anthropologists must be aware of how the human skeleton can differ between individuals . 
 = = = Determination of sex = = = 
 Depending on which bones are present , sex can be determined by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms . When available , the pelvis is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy . The examination of the pubic arch and the location of the sacrum can help determine sex . 
 However , the pelvis is not always present , so forensic anthropologists must be aware of other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes . The skull also contains multiple markers that can be used to determine sex . Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line , the eye sockets , the supraorbital ridge , as well as the nuchal lines , and the mastoid process . In general , male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls , and to have more pronounced ridges . 
 It is important for forensic anthropologists to take into account all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex . For example , it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch . It is for this reason that anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities : male , may be male , indeterminate , may be female , or female . In addition , forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death . The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation . 
 = = = Determination of stature = = = 
 The determination of stature by anthropologists is based off a series of formulas that have been developed over time by the examination of multiple different skeletons from a multitude of different regions and backgrounds . Stature is given as a range of possible values , in centimeters , and typically computed by measuring the bones of the leg . The three bones that are used are the femur , the tibia , and the fibula . In addition to the leg bones , the bones of the arm , the humerus , ulna , and radius can be used . The formulas that are used to determine stature rely on various information regarding the individual . Sex , ancestry , and age should be determined before attempting to ascertain height , if possible . This is due to the differences that occur between populations , sexes , and age groups . By knowing all the variables associated with height , a more accurate estimate can be made . For example , a male formula for stature estimation using the femur is 2 @.@ 32 × femur length + 65 @.@ 53 ± 3 @.@ 94 cm . A female of the same ancestry would use the formula , 2 @.@ 47 × femur length + 54 @.@ 10 ± 3 @.@ 72 cm . It is also important to note an individual 's approximate age when determining stature . This is due to the shrinkage of the skeleton that naturally occurs as a person ages . After age 30 , a person loses approximately one centimeter of their height every decade . 
 = = = Determination of age = = = 
 The determination of an individual 's age by anthropologists depends on whether or not the individual was an adult or a child . The determination of the age of children , under the age of 21 , is usually performed by examining the teeth . When teeth are not available , children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed . The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys . The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25 . In addition , if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones . While adults have 206 bones , the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number . 
 The aging of adult skeletons is not as straightforward as aging a child 's skeleton as the skeleton changes little once adulthood is reached . One possible way to estimate the age of an adult skeleton is to look at bone osteons under a microscope . New osteons are constantly formed by bone marrow even after the bones stop growing . Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments . Another potential method for determining the age of an adult skeleton is to look for arthritis indicators on the bones . Arthritis will cause noticeable rounding of the bones . The degree of rounding from arthritis coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual . 
 = = = Determination of ancestry = = = 
 The determination of an individual 's ancestry is typically grouped into three historical groups , Caucasoid , Mongoloid , and Negroid . However , the use of these classifications is becoming much harder as the rate of interracial marriages increases and markers become less defined . By measuring distances between landmarks on the skull as well as the size and shape of specific bones anthropologists can use a series of equations to estimate ancestry . Typically , the maxilla is used to help anthropologists determine an individual 's ancestry due to the three basic shapes , hyperbolic , parabolic , and rounded , belonging to the three historical ancestries , Negroid , Caucasoid , and Mongoloid respectively . In addition to the maxilla , the zygomatic arch and the nasal opening have been used to narrow down possible ancestry . A program called <unk> has been created that will calculate the most likely ancestry using complex mathematical formulas . This program is continually updated with new information from known individuals to maintain a database of current populations and their respective measurements . 
 = = = Other markers = = = 
 Anthropologists are also able to see other markers present on the bones . Past fractures will be evident by the presence of bone remodeling . The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante @-@ mortem ( before death ) , peri @-@ mortem ( at the time of death ) , or post @-@ mortem ( after death ) . Ante @-@ mortem fractures will show signs of healing while <unk> and post @-@ mortem fractures will not . Peri @-@ mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post @-@ mortem breaks will appear brittle . Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications .

 = = = Forensic archaeology = = = 
 Forensic archaeologists employ their knowledge of proper excavation techniques to ensure that remains are recovered in a controlled and forensically acceptable manner . When remains are found partially or completely buried the proper excavation of the remains will ensure that any evidence present on the bones will remain intact . The difference between forensic archaeologists and forensic anthropologists is that where forensic anthropologists are trained specifically in human osteology and recovery of human remains , forensic archaeologists specialize more broadly in the processes of search and discovery . In addition to remains , archaeologists are trained to look for objects contained in and around the excavation area . These objects can include anything from wedding rings to potentially probative evidence such as cigarette butts or shoe prints . Their training extends further to observing context , association and significance of objects in a crime scene and drawing conclusions that may be useful for locating a victim or suspect . A forensic archaeologist must also be able to utilize a degree of creativity and adaptability during times when crime scenes can not be excavated using traditional archaeological techniques . For example , one particular case study was conducted on the search and recovery of the remains of a missing girl who was found in a septic tank underground . This instance required unique methods unlike those of a typical archeological excavation in order to exhume and preserve the contents of the tank . 
 Forensic archaeologists are involved within three main areas . Assisting with crime scene research , investigation , and recovery of evidence and / or skeletal remains is only one aspect . 
 Processing scenes of mass fatality or incidents of terrorism ( i.e. homicide , mass graves and war crimes , and other violations of human rights ) is a branch of work that forensic archaeologists are involved with as well . 
 Forensic archaeologists can help determine potential grave sites that might have been overlooked . Differences in the soil can help forensic archaeologists locate these sites . During the burial of a body , a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave . The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas . Typically , grave sites will have looser , darker , more organic soil than areas around it . The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations . 
 One other implement to the career of a forensic archaeologist is teaching and research . Educating law enforcement , crime scene technicians and investigators , as well as undergraduate and graduate students is a critical part of a forensic archaeologist ’ s career in order to spread knowledge of proper excavation techniques to other forensic personnel and to increase awareness of the field in general . Crime scene evidence in the past has been compromised due to improper excavation and recovery by untrained personnel . Forensic anthropologists are then unable to provide meaningful analyses on retrieved skeletal remains due to damage or contamination . Research conducted to improve archaeological field methods , particularly to advance nondestructive methods of search and recovery are also important for the advancement and recognition of the field . 
 There is an ethical component that must be considered . The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests . Forensic archaeologists are often contracted to assist with the processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing peace of mind to families and communities . These projects are at times opposed by smaller , human rights groups who wish to avoid overshadowing memories of the individuals with their violent manner ( s ) of death . In cases like these , forensic archaeologists must practice caution and recognize the implications behind their work and the information they uncover . 
 = = = Forensic taphonomy = = = 
 The examination of skeletal remains often takes into account environmental factors that affect decomposition . Forensic taphonomy is the study of these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil , water , and the interaction with plants , insects , and other animals . In order to study these effects , body farms have been set up by multiple universities . Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers . At these locations , cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied . Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body . 
 Forensic taphonomy is divided into two separate sections , <unk> and <unk> . <unk> is the study of how the environment affects the decomposition of the body . Specifically it is the examination of biological remains in order to ascertain how decomposition or destruction occurred . This can include factors such as animal scavenging , climate , as well as the size and age of the individual at the time of death . <unk> must also take into account common mortuary services such as embalming and their effects on decomposition . 
 <unk> is the examination of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment . <unk> examinations can include how the soil was disturbed , pH alteration of the surrounding area , and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body . By examining these characteristics , examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death . This can potentially help determine the time since death , whether or not trauma on the skeleton was a result of peri or post @-@ mortem activity , as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant . 
 = = Education = = 
 Individuals looking to become forensic anthropologists first obtain a bachelor 's degree in anthropology from an accredited university . During their studies they should focus on physical anthropology as well as osteology . In addition it is recommended that individuals take courses in a wide range of sciences such as biology , chemistry , anatomy , and genetics . 
 Once undergraduate education is completed the individual should proceed to graduate level courses . Typically , forensic anthropologists obtain doctorates in physical anthropology and have completed coursework in osteology , forensics , and archaeology . It is also recommended that individuals looking to pursue a forensic anthropology profession get experience in dissection usually through a gross anatomy class as well as useful internships with investigative agencies or practicing anthropologists . Once educational requirements are complete one can become certified by the forensic anthropology society in the region . This can include the <unk> exam given by the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe or the certification exam given by the American Board of Forensic Anthropology . 
 Typically , most forensic anthropologists perform forensic casework on a part @-@ time basis , however there are individuals who work in the field full @-@ time usually with federal or international agencies . Forensic anthropologists are usually employed in academia either at a university or a research facility . 
 = = Ethics = = 
 Like other forensic fields , forensic anthropologists are held to a high level of ethical standards due to their work in the legal system . Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any piece of evidence can be sanctioned , fined , or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation . Individuals who fail to disclose any conflict of interests or who fail to report all of their findings , regardless of what they may be , can face disciplinary actions . It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation . Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice . 
 In addition to the evidentiary guidelines forensic anthropologists should always keep in mind that the remains they are working with were once a person . If possible , local customs regarding dealing with the dead should be observed and all remains should be treated with respect and dignity .

 = Melodifestivalen = 
 Melodifestivalen ( / <unk> / ; literally " The Melody Festival " ) is an annual music competition organised by Swedish public broadcasters Sveriges Television ( SVT ) and Sveriges Radio ( SR ) . It determines the country 's representative for the Eurovision Song Contest , and has been staged almost every year since 1959 . Since 2000 , the competition has been the most popular television programme in Sweden ; it is also broadcast on radio and the Internet . In 2012 , the semifinals averaged 3 @.@ 3 million viewers , and over an estimated four million people in Sweden watched the final , almost half of the Swedish population . 
 The festival has produced six Eurovision winners and eighteen top @-@ five placings for Sweden at the contest . The winner of the Melodifestival has been chosen by panels of jurors since its inception . Since 1999 , the juries have been joined by a public telephone vote which has an equal influence over the final outcome . The competition makes a considerable impact on music charts in Sweden . 
 The introduction of semifinals in 2002 raised the potential number of contestants from around twelve to thirty @-@ two . A children 's version of the competition , Lilla Melodifestivalen , also began that year . Light orchestrated pop songs , known locally as schlager music , are so prevalent that the festival is sometimes referred to as <unk> ( " The schlager festival " ) by the Swedish media . However , other styles of music such as rap , reggae , and glam rock have made an appearance since the event 's expansion . The introduction of a grand final in Stockholm has attracted substantial tourism to the city . 
 = = Origins = = 
 With seven nations competing , the first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano , Switzerland in May 1956 . Sweden 's first contest was the third , in 1958 . Without broadcasting a selection , Sveriges Radio ( SR ) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum . The song selected was " <unk> stjärna <unk> för oss <unk> " , later renamed " Lilla stjärna " . It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958 . 
 The first Melodifestival , incorporated into the <unk> det med musik radio series , took place on 29 January 1959 at <unk> in Stockholm ; eight songs participated . Four " expert " juries in Stockholm , Gothenburg , Malmö , and Luleå decided the winner . The competition was won by <unk> <unk> performing " Augustin " , but SR decided that the winning song — regardless of its original performer — would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision . This policy , of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen , was stopped in 1961 . The competition became a stand @-@ alone television programme in 1960 , known as the <unk> , <unk> final . In the event 's early years , it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the <unk> network . The competition adopted its current name , Melodifestivalen , in 1967 . 
 The Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions . In 1964 , the competition was cancelled due to an artist 's strike ; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year . Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system , which had led to a four @-@ way tie for first place at the 1969 contest . After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm , left @-@ wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again . This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti @-@ commercial <unk> . Therefore , Sweden decided not send a song to Eurovision 1976 , but returned in 1977 . 
 = = Participation = = 
 Hundreds of songs and performers have entered Melodifestivalen since its debut . Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen , the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries , provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter . To be eligible , songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semifinal . 
 Until 2001 , participation in the festival was limited to a single night . The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve . A two @-@ round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998 , in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting . Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist ; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984 , it almost ended her career . The introduction of weekly semifinals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty @-@ two . At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish . A CD of each year 's competing songs has been released since 2001 , and a DVD of the semifinals and final since 2003 . 
 Melodifestivalen has been the launch @-@ pad for the success of popular local acts , such as ABBA , Tommy Körberg , and Lisa Nilsson . The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden , including Baccara , Alannah Myles , and Cornelis Vreeswijk . Melodifestivalen participants have also represented — and unsuccessfully tried to represent — other countries at Eurovision . While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common , most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success . The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales . For example , the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990 , " <unk> " by Loa <unk> , topped the Swedish singles chart . The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir & Viktor 's song " Bada <unk> " . In 2007 , twenty @-@ one participants reached Sverigetopplistan . The week after the 2008 final , songs from the festival made up the entire top fifteen on the domestic singles chart . 
 = = Selection of contestants = = 
 The process of narrowing thousands of potential entries down to thirty @-@ two lasts over seven months . SVT directly selects sixteen entries from amongst the submissions from the public at large . Fifteen additional entries come from special invitations made by SVT or other entries that SVT has selected from amongst the submissions . Finally , the thirty @-@ second entry is selected via the online " <unk> " competition , open to artists whose music has not available for sale in Sweden prior to the deadline . The entire process can begin as early as May of the previous year and is finished by January . 
 = = = Songs = = = 
 SVT begins looking for songs nine months before the start of the televised Melodifestival ( within days of the previous year 's Eurovision final ) . The deadline for submission is in September and songs can be in any language . In the pre @-@ selection , song length is limited to three minutes and twenty seconds ; songs must be shortened to three minutes if they reach the final twenty @-@ eight and qualifying songs may also be remixed . 
 The submission process is overseen by members of the Swedish Music Publishers Association ( <unk> ) , whose task is to reduce the number of songs , which have numbered over 3 @,@ 000 a year since 2002 , to around 1 @,@ 200 . The 3 @,@ 440 entries received in the preselection for Melodifestivalen 2009 is the most in the competition 's history . The <unk> 's choices are then given to a sixteen @-@ person jury of music professionals , SVT staff and other members of the public . The jury ranges from teenagers to people in their fifties . The songs that qualify , along with their composers and lyricists , are announced at the end of September . This is often followed by fervent speculation over who will perform the songs . Songwriters that qualify must provide interviews to SVT , attend a press conference before the competition , and remain open to promotional appearances if their song reaches the final . 
 = = = Artists and wildcards = = = 
 SVT selects performers for the entries . Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition ; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found . The artists ' songs risk disqualification if they refuse . In the past , this rule led to the disqualification of , among others , Carola 's " <unk> <unk> <unk> " in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds 's " So Good " in 2006 . SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist . This prevented the <unk> City <unk> ( in 2004 ) and Pernilla Wahlgren ( in 2005 ) from performing the songs they had submitted . Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition . In 2006 , " Naughty Boy " by Hannah Graaf ( the replacement for Simmonds ' song ) finished second to last in its semifinal . In 2002 and 2007 , by contrast , the replacements performed by Jan Johansen and Måns <unk> reached the final ten . The contestants that will perform the twenty @-@ eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November . Singer @-@ songwriters are common . As such , artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement . 
 The wildcard ( joker ) system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured . Four artists , one in each semifinal , are invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition , provided it does not breach the rules . The wildcard songs and artists are announced in January . Since the wildcards ' introduction , three have won the competition . Today in 2011 there are 15 wildcards . 
 = = Hosting = = 
 The venues for each year 's Melodifestival are announced in September of the preceding year . The semifinals are held in towns and cities throughout Sweden . The 16 @,@ 300 @-@ capacity Ericsson Globe in Stockholm has hosted the final since the semifinals were introduced in 2002 , through to 2012 . In 2013 , the final moved to the newly built Friends Arena in Solna Municipality , Stockholm County . The Scandinavium in Gothenburg was offered the 2005 final , but turned it down as it clashed with a Frölunda ice hockey match . 
 The event spent its early years at one venue : <unk> in Stockholm , which hosted the first ten competitions . It has hosted the final of Melodifestivalen seventeen times in total . The Stockholm Globe Arena has hosted seven finals , and SVT 's headquarters in Stockholm has staged five . The competition first took place outside Stockholm in 1975 as part of a decentralisation policy at SR . Stockholm has hosted thirty @-@ seven finals in total , including the first fourteen . Gothenburg has hosted eight , and Malmö seven . The competition 's final has never been held outside these cities . Before the expansion , the host of the previous year 's Melodifestival would host the Eurovision Song Contest in the event of a Swedish victory . Hence , the 1985 Eurovision was held in Gothenburg , and the 1992 contest in Malmö . Since 2002 , the only venue that has hosted more than three semifinals is Gothenburg 's Scandinavium , which has hosted one every year since 2003 . In 2008 , Andra <unk> was held in Kiruna , north of the Arctic Circle . 
 = = Televised rounds = = 
 The televised Melodifestival lasts five weeks and consists of six live shows : four semifinals , in which eight songs compete ; a Second Chance round featuring songs which narrowly missed out on qualification from the semifinals ; and a grand final . Ten songs comprise the final : two automatic qualifiers from each of the semifinals , and the two most popular songs in the Second Chance round . In 2015 , there are seven songs for each semifinal , and twelve ( eight winners and four from Andra <unk> ) in the final . 
 = = = Semifinals and Second Chance = = = 
 Prior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals ( <unk> ) in 2002 , the competition was usually a single live show . Under the current system , four semifinals are broadcast at 20 : 00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights . The semifinals begin in early February , and eight songs compete in each show . 
 Unlike in the final , no juries are used ; televoting decides the results . The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting ; the song receiving the most votes in the first round automatically qualifying to the final , skipping the second round . The remaining top 4 battled again for a place in the final and Andra chansen round - the 2nd placed song qualifying to the final , and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen . Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast . The organisation of a semifinal system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections . A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004 . 
 The Second Chance round ( Andra chansen ) is the fifth heat in which the ninth and tenth places in the final are decided . The third- and fourth @-@ placed songs from each semifinal ( eight songs in total ) compete in the event . The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists . Between 2003 and 2006 , the semifinal performances were re @-@ broadcast , and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four . Another round then determined the two finalists . The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semifinal . It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semifinals — such as Berns <unk> in Stockholm , which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005 . 
 In 2007 , the Second Chance round became a full semifinal , taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others . The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night , adding an extra week to the event 's timetable . The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock @-@ out system . The system pairs the eight songs off against each other , then narrows them down to four before pairing them off again . The winners of the two second round pairings go through to the final . The two finalists do not reprise their songs at the end of the programme . 
 = = = Final = = = 
 The final takes place at 20 : 00 CET on a Saturday in mid @-@ March . Ten songs ( 11 songs in 2009 , 12 in 2015 ) participate : two from each semifinal , two from the Second Chance round , and , only in 2009 , the international jury 's choice . A running order is decided by the competition 's supervisors the week before to ensure that similar songs and artists are kept apart in the final . Dress rehearsals for the final are held on the prior Friday , and tickets sell out almost as quickly as those for the final itself . The final attracts much tourism to its host city ; a survey in 2006 showed that 54 % of spectators had travelled from outside the host city , Stockholm . Of these , 6 % had come from outside Sweden . 
 As at Eurovision , a broadcast of the EBU logo introduces and closes the television coverage , accompanied by the prelude to Marc @-@ Antoine Charpentier 's setting of " Te Deum " . Video " postcards " introduce the entries . The final includes interval performances , which are performed while the juries deliberate and before the televote closes . Former Melodifestivalen contestants have performed as interval acts in the past , including Lena Philipsson in 2005 and the multi @-@ artist medley of former entries in 2000 . 
 The winner receives a trophy , Den stora <unk> ( The Great Songbird ) , from the previous year 's winner . The trophy , designed by Ernst <unk> , was unveiled in 2005 and awarded to all previous Melodifestivalen winners at the Alla <unk> Melodifestival gala in March of that year . The winner of the competition reprises their song at the end of the event . 
 = = Voting = = 
 Before the introduction of the current voting system in 1999 , a group of regional or age @-@ based juries decided the winner of Melodifestivalen . In 1993 , televoting was used experimentally , but proved unsuccessful . The Swedish telephone network collapsed due to the number of calls , and claims by the Swedish tabloid press suggested the use of televoting had drastically altered the results . Evening newspapers released what they claimed to be the back @-@ up juries ' votes , which showed that the winner , <unk> 's " Eloise " , would have finished fourth had the juries ' votes counted . SVT never confirmed the accuracy of these claims . 
 The current voting format introduced in 1999 is a positional voting system , similar to that used at the Eurovision Song Contest . The voting is made up of two segments , in the first of which juries announce their votes ; in the second segment the televoting result is announced . The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points , which means that televotes and juries have an equal 50 / 50 weighing in the final result . The juries , usually 11 , have represented either Swedish regions or , since 2010 , countries participating in the year 's Eurovision Song Contest . Each jury award 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12 points to their top seven songs . After the jury voting , the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order . Between 1999 and 2011 , the televoting points were fixed ; the top seven songs would receive 11 , 22 , 44 , 66 , 88 , 110 and 132 points . Starting in 2011 , televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of total vote . If an entry receives 10 % of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10 % of 473 points , i.e. 48 points . The song with the highest number of points at the end of the voting is the winner . 
 Telephone lines open immediately after the radio preview for the final and do not close until the juries have voted . Two telephone numbers are used for each song , giving voters the option of whether to donate money to SVT 's <unk> charity appeal or not as they vote . Viewers can also vote by text message , and only residents of Sweden can vote . 
 The votes of the juries are announced by spokespeople who are not members of the juries . The votes are read in ascending order , beginning with one point and finishing with twelve . When read , they are repeated by the host , for example : 
 Spokesperson : " Ett <unk> till <unk> <unk> <unk> . " ( One point to song number two . ) 
 Presenter : Ett <unk> till ( name song ) . " ( One point to ( name song ) . ) 
 Since 2012 , most spokespeople have announced the points in English , with the hosts repeating them in Swedish . 
 As the votes are announced , they are collated on a graphic scoreboard . SVT varies the way the jury votes are announced from year to year . For example , the finalists of Expedition : Robinson acted as spokespeople in 2004 , and in 2006 Fredrik Lindström announced jury tallies using the dialects of each region . The final of Melodifestivalen has broken Nordic voting records on several occasions ; in 2007 , voting figures exceeded two million for the first time . 
 If there is a tie , the song that has received more votes from the public receives the higher position . There have been two ties for first place in the history of the contest . In 1969 , Tommy Körberg tied for first place with Jan Malmsjö . The juries them voted for their favourite out the two , leading to Tommy Körberg winning . In 1978 , Björn <unk> tied for first place with Lasse Holm and <unk> ( performing together ) ; a similar tie @-@ break process resulting in <unk> winning .

 Fifty @-@ five of Sweden 's fifty @-@ six Eurovision representatives have come from Melodifestivalen . Sweden has won the Eurovision Song Contest six times : in 1974 , 1984 , 1991 , 1999 , 2012 and 2015 . Sweden has the second highest number of wins for a country at Eurovision ; only Ireland has won the contest more often . The 1974 Eurovision winner , ABBA 's " Waterloo " , was voted the most popular Melodifestivalen song of all time at the Alla <unk> Melodifestival gala in March 2005 . Later that year , it was voted most popular Eurovision song of the contest 's first fifty years at a gala in Copenhagen . The following table lists those entries which finished fifth or higher at Eurovision :

 Most of Melodifestivalen 's rules are dictated by those of the Eurovision Song Contest . However , regulations have been introduced by the Swedish broadcasters . The competition 's official rules are released by SVT early in preparation for each year 's Melodifestival , to ensure any changes are noted by songwriters and performers . 
 There was a limit of six people on stage for each performance . This included the Melodifestivalen choir ( <unk> , literally " the house choir " ) , a five @-@ person group of flexible backing singers used by most participants . Artists could use some or all of the back @-@ up singers , or use their own group . All vocals had to be completely live ; human voices were not allowed on backing tracks . However , from 2009 , the number of performers allowed on stage was eight , and voices were allowed on backing tracks . A live orchestra was used every year from the event 's debut to 2000 , except 1985 and 1986 . Two orchestras were used between 1960 and 1963 , a large orchestra and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a jazz quartet . Since 2001 , participants have performed to backing tracks . 
 Entries cannot be publicly broadcast until the semifinals are previewed on radio . Entries eliminated in the semifinals may be broadcast as soon as the semifinal has finished . An embargo is placed on songs that qualify for the later rounds until the previews for the Second Chance are broadcast . After this , restrictions on the broadcast of contestant songs are lifted . 
 Broadcasters sometimes make sweeping changes to winning songs before they go to Eurovision . For example , at Melodifestivalen 1961 , <unk> <unk> won with " April , April " . Performing after her victory , she stumbled on the lyrics of the song and laughed out loud . The press criticised this as childish . SR replaced her with <unk> @-@ Babs for the Eurovision Song Contest . The 1987 winner " <unk> <unk> och en Coca Cola " , performed by Lotta Engberg , is another example ; the song 's title was changed to " Boogaloo " for Eurovision , as use of a brand name was against the Contest 's rules . This name was chosen as Sweden 's two previous Eurovision winners had also included the suffix " <unk> " . 
 Until 1999 , competing songs were only permitted in Swedish , apart from 1965 , 1973 , 1974 , 1975 . This did not stop most winning entries recording English ( and other language ) versions of their songs . Since the abolition of Eurovision 's language restrictions in 1999 , regardless of the performance language at Melodifestivalen , every Swedish entry has been in English . Spanish , French , Greek , Italian , Portuguese , Bosnian and Persian are among the other languages to have featured . Cameron <unk> 's entry in Melodifestivalen 2005 was performed in a constructed language . 
 = = Media coverage = = 
 Melodifestivalen is broadcast on television , radio and the internet . It is broadcast on SVT1 with international coverage on SVT World . Until 1987 , the competition was broadcast on Sveriges Radio TV , later known as TV1 . Between 1988 and 2000 , the event was broadcast on different channels depending on where it was held . Finals in Stockholm were broadcast on Kanal 1 ( formerly TV1 ) while finals in Gothenburg or Malmö were broadcast on TV2 . Sveriges Radio has broadcast the event on P1 , P3 and P4 , where is currently broadcast . 
 Although the final is traditionally held on a Saturday , in 1990 it was held on a Friday . TV2 suggested this would attract more viewers . In 1991 , it was held on Easter Sunday for the same reason . The 2002 final was delayed by a week for coverage of the 2002 Winter Olympics . 
 The competition has had an official website since 1999 . <unk> have been provided since 2005 . Since 2006 , between February and the Eurovision final in May , SR has webcast a radio station dedicated to the competition called P4 <unk> . On P4 , the public previews semifinalists every Friday . Broadcast the night after the final , a dagen efter ( " the day after " ) television programme acts as an epilogue to the event . It gauges the reactions of the finalists after the competition 's climax . No commentary is given for the event on television . Carolina Norén is commentator on the event for Sveriges Radio . The festival has been broadcast in widescreen since 2002 and Dolby Digital since 2004 . 
 The competition 's viewing figures have been rising since 2002 . In 2007 , approximately 4 @.@ 1 million Swedes — almost 44 % of the country 's population — watched the final , and between 2 @.@ 9 million and 3 @.@ 2 million viewers watched each of the semifinals . The viewing figures for the 2007 festival are nearly two million short of the highest recorded viewing figures from 1990 . Melodifestivalen is given heavy coverage in the Swedish press . A study by the Economic Science and Communication Department at Karlstad University concluded that coverage from the press may have influenced the results of the 2007 festival . 
 = = Musical styles and presentation = = 
 Melodifestivalen 's image has evolved throughout its existence , but one word has defined the competition 's music : schlager . In Sweden , schlager ( a German word literally meaning a " hit " ) represents any song associated with the competition , from the jazz music featured heavily in the 1960s to entries such as Linda <unk> 's in 2006 . Christine <unk> of The Local described Swedish schlager as " typically characterized by an annoyingly repetitive melody and trivial lyrics of little or no meaning " . 
 Jazz artists such as Monica <unk> and <unk> <unk> won the event in the 1960s . ABBA , who won Eurovision in 1974 , went on to be Sweden 's most successful music export . The group influenced not only Melodifestivalen , but the entire Swedish mainstream music scene . In the 1980s , Bert Karlsson 's Mariann <unk> record label was responsible for the prevalence of " easy , memorable tunes " . The early twenty @-@ first century has seen more variety in the competition , such as The Ark 's " retro glam rock " effort and Afro @-@ dite 's disco winner . 
 On @-@ stage gimmicks have long been a part of performances at the competition . Lena Philipsson 's use of a microphone stand in her performance of " Det gör ont " at the 2004 competition is an example . When Philipsson hosted Melodifestivalen in 2006 , four tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek short films were broadcast during the semifinals to show what had happened to the microphone stand in the years since her win . Pyrotechnics are another common gimmick in Melodifestivalen performances . After the 2007 event , Karolina <unk> of Dagens Media criticised the festival 's musical content and production , arguing that the 1988 competition was " the time when Melodifestivalen was still a schlager competition " and the event had become " a cross between [ reality series ] Fame Factory and [ inter @-@ city game show ] <unk> " . 
 = Addicted to You ( Shakira song ) = 
 " Addicted to You " is a song recorded by Colombian singer @-@ songwriter Shakira for her ninth studio album Sale el Sol ( 2010 ) . The song was released as the fifth and final single from the album by Epic Records , on 13 March 2012 . " Addicted to You " was written by Shakira , El Cata , John Hill and Luis Fernando Ochoa , and is a merengue @-@ influenced song on the album . The song also draws prominent influences from reggaeton music , and lyrically describes Shakira 's infatuation for a lover . Despite having an English title , the majority of the song is sung in Spanish . 
 Upon its release , critics were generally favourable towards " Addicted to You " , and praised its uptempo beats . The song reached number one on the Monitor Latino chart in Mexico , where it was later certified platinum by the Mexican Association of Phonograph Producers ( AMPROFON ) . It also performed well on the charts of countries Poland , Spain , and France . In the United States , the single performed well on the Latin record charts , peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and at number three on both the Latin Pop Airplay and Tropical Songs chart . 
 An accompanying music video for " Addicted to You " was directed by Anthony Mandler , and features Shakira singing the song in various locations while sporting different outfits . Many critics praised the video 's overall appeal and Shakira 's appearance . The video reached over 100 million views on video @-@ sharing website YouTube , and received a " Vevo Certified " by joint venture music video website Vevo for the achievement .

 " Addicted to You " was written by Dominican rapper and record producer Edward Bello , American record producer John Hill , Luis Fernando Ochoa and Shakira , for the singer 's ninth studio album Sale el Sol . The album marked the first time she worked with Bello , who is better known by his stage name El Cata , and their collaboration started after Shakira expressed her desire to experiment with merengue music , saying " I grew up listening to merengue — that was a big part of my life , and I was missing it " . Merengue is a type of music and dance originating in the Dominican Republic , and after being referred to Bello by American rapper Pitbull , Shakira travelled to the country and began recording sessions with him in his " tiny " studio in Santo Domingo . Bello talked about his collaboration with Shakira , saying " If I was thinking that this little studio was going to be in the world ’ s vision at this time , I wouldn ’ t believe it " . On 14 March 2012 , Shakira 's official website announced that " Addicted to You " would be the fifth and final single to be released from Sale el Sol . It was made available for digital download on Amazon.com and ITunes by Epic Records a day earlier . 
 According to Shakira , Sale el Sol has three " directions " , one of which is the " Latino , tropical side " of the album . " Addicted to You " , along with other tracks " Loca and " Rabiosa " , is a primary example of this musical direction . In addition to merengue , " Addicted to You " is influenced by reggaeton music and features " a very 70 's chorus and Copacabana sounds " . Despite having an English title , the words " Addicted to You " are only sung in the chorus , and the rest of the song is sung entirely in Spanish . Lyrically , it details Shakira 's infatuation with a lover . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Critical reception towards " Addicted to You " was mostly positive . Jennifer Schaffer from The Stanford Daily commented that the song prevents the listener from getting " lulled " and " hurries back to the hip @-@ swaying dance beat " . Michelle Morgante from The Boston Globe picked the song as an example of Shakira 's " new merengue @-@ rock hybrid that lays down bare horn riffs over a driving beat in a groove that is irresistible " . Carlos Macias from Terra USA , however , gave it a negative review and criticized its use of a " cheap keyboard that drives the tune reminds us of music played at weddings and quinceañeras " . In 2013 , Latina included " Addicted to You " on their list of " The 13 Best Songs in Spanglish " and commented that " If non @-@ Spanish speakers can ’ t pick up the language after listening to this track , then we feel bad for you , son " . At the 28th International Dance Music Awards held in 2013 , " Addicted to You " was nominated for " Best Latin Dance Track " . It was also nominated at the 2013 Billboard Latin Music Awards for Latin Pop Song of the Year . El Cata received an ASCAP Latin award at the Pop category for his composition of the song . 
 Commercially , " Addicted to You " was a particular success in Mexico . It peaked at number one on the Monitor Latino chart in the region , and was later certified platinum by the Mexican Association of Phonograph Producers ( AMPROFON ) for shipments of 60 @,@ 000 units . Elsewhere , the song reached number one on the Polish Airplay chart . In France and Spain , the song peaked at numbers 15 and 14 , respectively . " Addicted to You " also performed well on the Latin record charts in the United States . It peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and stayed on the chart for a total 20 weeks . It peaked at number three on both the Latin Pop Airplay and Tropical Songs charts , staying on the charts for a total of 26 and 13 weeks , respectively . The song was acknowledged as an award winning song at the 2011 BMI Latin Awards .

 The accompanying music video for " Addicted to You " was directed by Anthony Mandler in a one @-@ day period in Valencia , California . The video premiered worldwide on 2 May 2012 , and became a " trending topic " on online social networking and microblogging service Twitter following its release . The plot @-@ less music video features Shakira singing the song in various locations while " writhing around " on a bed in candlelit room , dancing in front of " some foliage " in the streets of an " old Spanish style " town , and " splashing around in a bathtub " .

 Critical reception of the video was generally positive . Andrea Magrath from Daily Mail called Shakira 's look in the video " sexier than ever " . Jenna Hally Rubenstein from MTV praised Shakira 's appearance in the video , saying she looks " insanely en pointe " while " doing that <unk> Shakira hip move nobody else can replicate " . Becky Bain from Idolator commented that the video is a " complete success " in case " the main draw of watching a Shakira video is to watch the Colombian singer swivel her honest hips around pretty backdrops while wearing revealing clothing " . The video became immensely popular on video @-@ sharing website YouTube , and was marked " Vevo Certified " by joint venture music video website Vevo for reaching more than 100 million views .

 = Battle of Pyongtaek = 
 The Battle of Pyongtaek was the second engagement between United States and North Korean forces during the Korean War , occurring on July 6 , 1950 in the village of Pyongtaek in western South Korea . The fight ended in a North Korean victory following unsuccessful attempts by American forces to inflict significant damage or delays on advancing North Korean units , despite several opportunities to do so . 
 The United States Army 's 34th Infantry Regiment , 24th Infantry Division was assigned to delay elements of the North Korean People 's Army 's 4th Infantry Division as it advanced south following its victory at the Battle of Osan the day before . The regiment emplaced at Pyongtaek and Ansong attempting to form a line to hold the North Koreans in an area where the terrain formed a bottleneck between mountains and the Yellow Sea . 
 Half of the regiment 's strength was ordered to retreat from its position before the North Korean force was encountered , leaving the flank open for the remaining force , 1st Battalion at Pyongtaek . The battalion encountered North Korean forces the morning of July 6 , and after a brief fight , was unable to repel them effectively . The battalion then mounted a disorganized retreat to Cheonan several miles away , having failed to significantly delay the North Korean forces in their movement south .

 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 On the night of June 25 , 1950 , 10 divisions of the North Korean People 's Army launched a full @-@ scale invasion on the nation 's neighbor to the south , the Republic of Korea . The force of 89 @,@ 000 men moved in six columns , catching the Republic of Korea Army completely by surprise , resulting in a disastrous rout for the South Koreans , who were disorganized , ill @-@ equipped , and unprepared for war . Numerically superior , North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38 @,@ 000 South Korean soldiers on the front , advancing steadily south . Most of South Korea 's forces retreated in the face of the invasion , and by June 28 , the North Koreans had captured Seoul , South Korea 's capital , forcing the government and its shattered forces to withdraw south . 
 The United Nations Security Council voted to send assistance to the collapsing country . US President Harry S. Truman subsequently ordered ground troops into the nation . However , US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II five years earlier . At the time , the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army , which was headquartered in Japan under the command of Major General William F. Dean . However , the division was under strength , and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending following World War II . In spite of these deficiencies , the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea . 
 = = = Battle of Osan = = = 
 From the 24th Infantry Division , one battalion was assigned to be airlifted into Korea via C @-@ 54 Skymaster transport aircraft and move quickly to block advancing North Korean forces while the remainder of the division could be transported to South Korea on ships . The 21st Infantry Regiment was determined to be the most combat @-@ ready of the 24th Infantry Division 's three regiments , and the 21st Infantry 's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander , Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith , was the most experienced , having commanded a battalion at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II . On July 5 , Task Force Smith engaged North Korean forces at the Battle of Osan , delaying over 5 @,@ 000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being routed and forced back . 
 During that time , the 24th Division 's 34th Infantry Regiment , with 2 @,@ 000 men organized into the 1st and 3rd Battalions , was the second US unit into Korea , and was sent by rail north from Pusan . The 1st Battalion , 34th Infantry emplaced at Pyongtaek , 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Osan , to block the next North Korean advance . Pyongtaek was a village consisting mostly of wooden huts and muddy roads In the meantime , 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry was emplaced at <unk> , several miles east . The two battalions were assigned to form a line to block any North Korean advance . Terrain south of the Ansong – Pyongtaek line was substantially more open , meaning the line sat on a bottleneck , with mountain ranges to the east and an inlet of the Yellow Sea to the west . Therefore , Dean considered the line vital to his defensive plans . 
 The 1st Battalion was unprepared for a fight as it was poorly trained and had no tanks or anti @-@ tank guns to fight North Korean armor . Shortages of equipment hampered the entire division 's efforts . Shortages in heavy guns reduced artillery support to the entire division . Communications equipment , weapons , and ammunition was largely absent , large amounts of equipment were en route but the division had been under @-@ equipped in Japan . Most of the radios available to the division did not work , and batteries , communication wire , and telephones to communicate among units were in short supply . The division had no tanks : its new M26 Pershing and older M4A3 Sherman tanks had not yet arrived . One of the few weapons that could penetrate the North Korean T @-@ 34 , high explosive anti @-@ tank ammunition , was in short supply . The paucity of radios and wire hampered communication between and among the American units . 
 The battalion 's new commander , Lieutenant Colonel Ayres , was apparently given faulty intelligence , and he told his command that the Koreans advancing south were poorly trained and poorly equipped . The battalion formed a line 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Pyongtaek , in a series of grassy hills and rice paddies where it dug in and prepared for advancing North Korean forces . The soldiers of the battalion were equipped with only M1 Garand rifles or other weapons , C @-@ rations , and less than 100 rounds of ammunition each , whilst only one M2 Browning machine gun was available to each platoon . There were no grenades and little to no ammunition for any of the heavier weapons which could be used against North Korean tanks . Additionally , only a few of the soldiers of the regiment had any combat experience from World War II , and they had been hastily transferred from another division the day before .

 A reconnaissance team sent north on the evening of July 5 reported seeing tanks south of Osan . The team attempted to destroy a tank it spotted in the village of <unk> but was unsuccessful ; it suffered one killed ( Private Kenneth R. Shadrick ) and was forced to return to Pyongtaek . Shortly after , several survivors from Task Force Smith arrived at 1st Battalion 's command post telling stories of their defeat at Osan , but Ayres did not believe they were accurate . Brigadier General George B. Barth , acting division artillery commander for the 24th Infantry Division , stopped by the command post and ordered that the battalion hold only as long as it could , and not to risk being flanked or surrounded , wary of the defeat at Osan . Barth then moved to the 34th Infantry Regiment 's command where he ordered regimental commander Colonel Jay B. Lovless to consolidate the Regiment at Cheonan to the south . Lovless subsequently moved 3rd Battalion south , without having ever engaged the enemy . Barth believed the 34th Infantry would not be able to defend Pyongtaek as long as the 21st Infantry defended Osan . From 3rd Battalion , L Company was detached and ordered to hold south of Pyongtaek to cover the 1st Battalion when it retreated . This order was not carried out , and L Company left for Chonan . 
 Having pushed back Task Force Smith at Osan , the North Korean 4th Infantry Division , supported by elements of the North Korean 105th Armored Division , continued their advance down the Osan @-@ Pyongtaek road , up to 12 @,@ 000 men strong under division commander Lee Kwon Mu in two infantry regiments supported by dozens of tanks . Barth , who had been with Task Force Smith as an observer , had ordered the 1st Battalion , 34th Infantry to hold until the North Koreans threatened to envelop them , then to fall back to successive positions south , delaying the North Korean force as long as possible . At midnight on July 5 , several more survivors of Task Force Smith streamed into the battalion 's lines . At 0300 on July 6 , the battalion destroyed a small bridge over a stream 600 yards ( 550 m ) north of its position . 
 = = = North Korean attack = = = 
 Rain and fog were heavy throughout the morning of July 6 , and visibility was limited for the emplaced troops . Just after daybreak , 13 North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks were spotted stopped at the bridge . Following them were two columns of infantry . The American forces originally believed that they might be survivors of Task Force Smith until they realized the forces were deploying in numbers too great , and began preparing to attack the unsuspecting North Koreans . The battalion 's commander ordered mortar fire on the North Korean forces , causing them to disperse as the lead tank began firing on the positions of A Company , on a hill southwest of the road . Mortar fire destroyed a truck , but a round from a North Korean tank stunned the artillery observer and no one took his place in the confusion , ending the American mortar attack . North Korean forces immediately began advancing on A Company 's position , but the company was not able to return fire effectively , with fewer than half of its soldiers using their weapons . For several minutes only squad and platoon leaders shot back while the rest of the soldiers hid in their foxholes . Within fifteen minutes , B Company was able to return fire effectively , and by this time the North Korean forces had advanced steadily toward 1st Battalion 's position . Later examinations found many American soldiers ' weapons were assembled incorrectly or were dirty or broken . The Americans had nothing with which to fight the tanks , and were unable to do anything to stop them . 
 As North Korean soldiers advanced , they began to envelop both A and B Companies , and 30 minutes after the first shots were fired , both companies were ordered to withdraw , one platoon at a time . C Company , kept in reserve during the engagement , retreated without coming in contact with North Korean forces . A Company , under the heaviest attack , attempted a gradual withdrawal which quickly became disorderly , as men ran from the hill , some without weapons and ammunition , being strafed by North Korean machine guns the entire time . Panic quickly overtook many of the men of the battalion , and they started running past the designated rally points , all the way to Pyongtaek . Others , too scared to retreat , remained in their foxholes and were captured by the North Korean forces . One officer attempted to stay behind and search for survivors , before he and three others were allegedly captured and executed by North Korean forces . Company commanders gathered what men they could and began moving south , though one @-@ fourth of 1st Battalion was killed , missing or captured immediately after the brief fight . The retreating elements left a trail of equipment behind , littering the road back to Pyongtaek with ammunition , helmets , and rain gear . In the disorderly retreat one platoon from A Company was left behind , and had to retreat through a railway for cover . 
 = = = American withdrawal = = = 
 The battalion regrouped at Pyongtaek itself , mostly a mass of disorganized soldiers without leadership . Engineers with the battalion demolished a bridge north of the town before moving south . The remains of A Company then headed for Cheonan , regrouping there with the rest of the 1st and 3rd Battalions which had also withdrawn . Though a few jeeps and trucks were found and commandeered , most of the retreat was carried out on foot . A few scattered artillery shells landed around the retreating force , but North Korean soldiers did not aggressively pursue them . By noon the disorganized remains of the 34th Infantry had outrun all enemy fire and were out of immediate danger . 
 The soldiers , most of their equipment missing , made no attempt at further delaying actions , and were unable to communicate with other units because their radio equipment had been lost . As they were retreating , an American aircraft accidentally strafed the column , injuring one South Korean soldier moving with them , further demoralizing the soldiers . The 34th Infantry Regiment began to set up a new line south of Chonan by nightfall , even though many of its men no longer had equipment to fight with . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 General Dean , the divisional commander , was angered by the poor performance of the 34th Infantry Regiment during the battle . He allegedly was upset that the regiment retreated so quickly without attempting to further delay the North Koreans . He considered ordering the regiment back north immediately but did not do so for fear of ambush . Dean replaced the commander of the 34th Infantry , Colonel Lovless , and ordered the 3rd Battalion back north , but when it encountered North Korean resistance it immediately became disorganized and was forced to withdraw . The engagement at Pyongtaek had caused a significant decline in morale among American forces fighting on the peninsula , and this would continue until victories at Inchon and the Pusan Perimeter allowed them to go on the offensive . Dean took the blame for the defeat himself , and historians consider him at least partially at fault for expecting one inexperienced battalion to hold the line against a numerically superior enemy who was well @-@ trained . 
 The regiment was forced to regroup at Cheonan and oppose the North Korean forces again , and it suffered heavy casualties before being forced to withdraw after the Battle of Cheonan . The 24th Infantry Division would continue to fight in delaying actions such as this one for two more weeks until it was overwhelmed at the Battle of Taejon , however by that time the Pusan Perimeter would be in place , and other US divisions would be able to hold the line for several more months during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter until the Inchon Landings , when American forces would finally defeat the North Korean Army , ending the first phase of the war .

 Mario Kart DS ( <unk> , Mario Kāto Dī Esu ) is a 2005 go @-@ kart racing game developed and published by Nintendo . It was released for the Nintendo DS handheld game console on November 14 , 2005 in North America , on November 17 , 2005 in Australia , on November 25 , 2005 in Europe , on December 8 , 2005 in Japan , and on April 5 , 2007 in South Korea . The game is the fifth installment in the Mario Kart series of video games , and the first to be playable via the Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection online service ; the service has since been terminated , along with other games playable via the service . Like other games in the series , Mario Kart DS features characters from the Mario series , and pits them against each other as they race in karts on tracks based on locations in the Mario series . 
 The game was very well received , receiving an aggregated score of 91 % from Metacritic . Praise focused on the game 's graphics and gameplay , while criticism targeted its repetitive single @-@ player mode . Mario Kart DS received several awards , including Editors ' Choice Awards from GameSpot and IGN , G @-@ Phoria 's Best Handheld Game award , and IGN 's Best Racing / Driving Game Mario Kart DS was the best @-@ selling game in its first month of release , and also held that position the following month . Overall , Mario Kart DS is the third best @-@ selling game for the Nintendo DS as of March 2016 , with 23 @.@ 60 million units sold worldwide . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Mario Kart DS is a racing game , in which the player races in a kart against other racers as one of eight characters , each with three karts to choose from . While racing or battling , the Nintendo DS 's top screen offers a third @-@ person perspective of the player 's kart , while the bottom touchscreen shows the race 's current standings , items carried by each racer , and a map of the course . The bottom screen can be toggled to show either an overview of the entire course , or a bird 's @-@ eye view of the players kart and the immediate vicinity , including nearby racers , course hazards , item boxes , and incoming attacks . Each course features item boxes that the player can drive through to receive a randomly selected item , which the player can use to gain an advantage over other racers . Some items allow the player to attack other racers to slow them down , while other items can be used to speed up the player 's own kart to pass other racers more easily . 
 = = = Game modes = = = 
 The game features five single @-@ player game modes : Grand Prix , Time Trial , Vs , Battle , and Mission . The Grand Prix and Vs modes require that the player choose an engine class from among 50 cc , 100 cc , 150 cc , and Mirror . The classes serve as difficulty levels — the higher the engine class , the faster all karts go . In addition , a Mirror mode can be unlocked , in which karts use 150 cc engines and tracks are flipped horizontally . In Grand Prix mode , the player competes against seven computer @-@ controlled racers in a series of predetermined courses . Unlike previous Mario Kart games , which featured four playable cups , Mario Kart DS features a total of eight cups : Mushroom , Flower , Star , Special , Shell , Banana , Leaf , and Lightning , with the latter four cups consisting entirely of tracks drawn from previous entries in the Mario Kart series . Each cup has four tracks for a grand total of 32 . When a cup is completed , a rating will be given based on the times and positions , ranging from E to A , then to 1 , 2 , or 3 stars . Just like in Double Dash ! ! , players received points for each finishing position . In Time Trial mode , the player must finish a course as quickly as possible by using one , two or three mushrooms ( depending on which kart is used ) . The fastest time is then saved as a ghost , a copy of the player 's performance , which the player can race against later . In Vs mode , the player races on a track of their choosing either against computer @-@ controlled opponents or in local multiplayer . The mode can be played either individually or in teams , which separates racers into a blue team and a red team ; in multiplayer , players can control which team they are placed on . In addition , the number of races played and scoring system can also be modified . Battle mode features two game modes , Balloon Battle and Shine Runners , both which also allow the player to play either individually or in teams . In Balloon Battle , the player must pop the balloons of the opposing players by attacking them , or they can steal balloons by boosting into other karts . Each participant starts the battle with one balloon . These can be re @-@ inflated up to four times . In multiplayer , if a human player loses all of his / her balloons , he / she is out of the game and turns into a ghost . As a ghost , a player can only place item boxes . If the battle is played in single player , then the match ends and the results are announced when all of the human player 's balloons are popped . In the second scenario , Shine Runners , the player must collect Shine Sprites ( an object from Super Mario Sunshine ) . The player can attack other racers to take away a Shine Sprite from them , and racers with the fewest Shine Sprites are eliminated from the game over time . In single player , if the human player is eliminated from the round , the game ends and the results are randomized . 
 In Mission Mode , the player must complete missions , each with objectives that range from collecting coins to attacking enemies . In each mission , the player controls a <unk> character . There are seven levels with eight missions in each . After completing each mission , the player 's performance is given a grade of stars ( three , two , or one ) or letters ( A , B , C , D , or E ) . After all eight missions in a level are complete , the player must complete a boss mission to advance to the next level . Once the first six levels are complete , and the rank of at least one star has been obtained on every mission , the seventh level is unlocked . 
 The game also features a multiplayer mode , in which eight players race each other using the DS Download Play feature or a multi @-@ card wireless LAN connection . Until its discontinuation on May 20 , 2014 , Mario Kart DS supported online play via the Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection , in which up to four players could play together . When playing online , participants could only race against each other ; Battle mode is not available when playing via an online connection . These features are not available in the Wii U VC version because the multiplayer features have not been emulated .

 Nintendo first announced on May 11 , 2005 that they planned to release a Mario Kart game for the Nintendo DS , releasing some gameplay video footage at the same time . The company offered the game for the public to play for the first time at the 2005 Game Developers Conference , where the game 's wireless feature was also showcased . Mario Kart DS was produced by Hideki Konno , who also worked on 2005 's Nintendogs . The game runs at a consistent 60 frames per second and uses full 3D characters and environments . 
 Mario Kart DS is the first Mario Kart iteration to support online play . Konno remarked that although both Mario Kart DS and the Halo series of games feature online play , he noted that most of the people who use the feature in Halo games were " hardcore gamers " . With Mario Kart DS , Konno wants " everyone to go online , and the technology and time is right for that to happen " . Continuing with the tradition of introducing a new gameplay mechanic in each Mario Kart game , Mario Kart DS is the first in the series to support up to eight players at the same time with game cartridges . New to the series , the game also includes a single @-@ player Battle Mode , which does not require that there be at least two human participants . As the first Mario Kart game for the Nintendo DS , the developers tested several features that took advantage of the device 's bottom touchscreen . They considered letting players place items anywhere on the track instead of just behind their kart . However , the developers found it too confusing because the game already had too many distractions , making it difficult to control where to place items while racing . 
 In Mario Kart DS , a kart is able to draft behind another kart to gain a speed boost momentarily , a feature that was also previously used in the 1996 video game Mario Kart 64 . Mario Kart DS places a stronger focus on the feature and once again provides a visual cue when a kart is drafting . In an interview , Konno notes that they included tracks from previous Mario Kart games into Mario Kart DS so that players who played the original Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System would feel more familiar with the DS iteration of the series . 
 The game 's soundtrack is composed by Double Dash ‼ composer Shinobu Tanaka with voices by Kazumi Totaka , Charles Martinet , Deanna Mustard and more .

 Mario Kart DS was released by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS in North America on November 14 , 2005 , in Australia on November 17 , 2005 , in Europe on November 25 , 2005 , in Japan on December 8 , 2005 , and in Korea on April 5 , 2007 . Nintendo later revealed that Mario Kart DS would also be sold bundled with a new red @-@ colored Nintendo DS starting on November 28 , 2005 , along with " a checkered @-@ flag wrist strap , and racing @-@ inspired decals to customize new red handheld " . The game was released to critical acclaim ; it hold aggregated score of 91 % on Metacritic . Praise focused on the game 's graphics and gameplay , while criticism targeted its repetitive single @-@ player mode . Mario Kart DS received Editors ' Choice awards from GameSpot and IGN . The game was nominated by GameSpot for several Best of 2005 awards , including Best Multiplayer Game , Best Driving Game , and Best DS Game , winning the last one . The game received G @-@ Phoria 's Best Handheld Game award . IGN gave the game the awards for Best Racing / Driving Game . 
 Several reviews praised the game for living up to the standards set by its predecessors . Finding the game 's online shortcomings annoying , GameSpy still believed that the single @-@ player mode and local wireless gameplay more than made up for them . Nintendo World Report noticed that " the best features of past Mario Kart games are back " and work well with the new features in Mario Kart DS , calling the end result " the most impressive game to ever hit the Nintendo DS and also the best game in the Mario Kart series " . X @-@ Play shared this sentiment , and remarked that the game shattered all of its expectations , making it the " best kart racing game ever released — handheld or otherwise " . GameZone also believed that Mario Kart DS " lives up to its legacy " with its inventive courses , " stellar " multiplayer , and " more replay value than any other racer in its class " . Alejandro K. Brown of CBS News appreciated the game 's unique use of Nintendo DS features , such as its microphone and wireless connectivity . GamesRadar named Mario Kart DS the best DS game of all time , beating out Pokémon Black and White ( 2nd ) and Grand Theft Auto : Chinatown Wars ( 3rd ) . 
 Finding it hard to imagine how Nintendo could make a Mario Kart game better than Mario Kart DS , IGN lauded Mario Kart DS 's gameplay and depth in its design . GameSpot called the game a " significant step forward " for the Mario Kart series , partly because it is the first in the series to feature online play . Game Revolution remarked that the game " goes the distance " with its single @-@ player and multiplayer modes . 1UP.com complimented the " surprisingly compelling package " , describing it as a " portable racing game on par with anything ever to appear on a console " . Video game magazine GamePro was pleased with the variety of racers , courses , modes , and multiplayer options offered , toting the game as a " must play " for any Nintendo fan and a requisite for any Nintendo DS owner to purchase . Computer and Video Games described Mario Kart DS as the " most complete " Mario Kart game , despite a few graphical shortcomings . Eurogamer enjoyed the game 's multiplayer mode , calling it " genuinely practical to play with other people " . British publication GamesTM criticized the game for being simply a " polishing of the Mario Kart concept and little else " , and video game website <unk> was disappointed with the " fairly repetitive " single @-@ player mode and the " cheap computer players " . 
 The game was the first for the Nintendo DS to take advantage of the console 's Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection feature . By the end of its debut week in the United States , 112 @,@ 000 people purchased the game , of which 52 @,@ 000 of them had logged onto Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection to play against other people over the Internet . Mario Kart DS was the best @-@ selling handheld game in its debut month of November 2005 in the United States . It was the 10th best @-@ selling game of 2008 , and the best @-@ selling Nintendo DS game of that year . In Japan , the game sold 224 @,@ 411 copies in its first week . Mario Kart DS sold 3 @,@ 112 @,@ 363 units as of July 2008 , and 3 @,@ 224 @,@ 996 copies as of January 2009 , making it the sixth best @-@ selling game for the Nintendo DS since the console 's release .

 = St Briavels Castle = 
 St Briavels Castle is a moated Norman castle at St Briavels in the English county of Gloucestershire . The castle is noted for its huge Edwardian gatehouse that guards the entrance . 
 St Briavels Castle was originally built between 1075 and 1129 as a royal administrative centre for the Forest of Dean . During the 13th century the castle became first a favourite hunting lodge of King John , and then the primary centre in England for the manufacture of quarrels , large numbers of which were required for crossbows in medieval warfare . The castle was transferred many times between royal favourites in the 14th and 15th centuries and slowly declined in appearance and importance . St Briavels Castle became used primarily as a court and as a notorious debtors ' prison , conditions being documented by the prison reformer John Howard in 1775 . Following local riots and a parliamentary investigation in the 1830s , reforms in the 19th century brought an end to the castle 's use as a prison . 
 Extensive renovation at the turn of the 20th century allowed St Briavels Castle to be taken over as a Youth Hostel in 1948 . It remains in this role today , owned by English Heritage and open to the public . The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 St Briavels Castle is located on a spur dominating a position above the River Wye , on the western edge of the Forest of Dean . The castle is predominantly built of local old red sandstone and limestone . The castle site is surrounded by an in @-@ filled moat ; now a garden , the moat was originally wet and fed by a spring underneath the moat itself . 
 The castle keep , which collapsed and was demolished in the 18th century , was originally a square Norman design , 15 @.@ 6 m by 13 @.@ 9 m ( 51 ft by 45 ft ) in size , built on a motte of clay and stone . Intact , it would have been approximately 20 m ( 66 ft ) tall , and would have resembled the keeps at Goodrich Castle and White Castle , both of a similar period and design in the region . 
 The keep was protected by the stone curtain wall that still survives today , forming the castle bailey . Its irregular polygonal plan suggests that it was built on the site of an earlier earthwork . It originally had a small round tower protecting the south @-@ east corner and probably a gateway in the south wall alongside the keep . Other demolished buildings included a forge and assorted buildings along the north @-@ east of the bailey . A set of medieval domestic buildings still stand along the north @-@ west side of the bailey , however , including a hall , solar and chapel , originally providing accommodation for the castle constable and the King . These buildings were restored in the 19th century to their current condition . Some features , including the hall range , fireplace and capitals appear to date from the 13th century . The hall and solar form a two @-@ storey building 23 m by 10 m ( 75 ft by 33 ft ) wide , alongside the 14th century chapel , which still incorporates later 17th century adjustments and windows . At one end of the domestic range is the famous " Forester 's Horn " chimney , crested with the forest warden 's horn , a symbol of Forest Law and the castle 's authority . The buildings include a sunken pit prison ; graffiti dated 1671 show that it was still in use for that purpose at that time . 
 The gatehouse of St Briavels Castle is described in Pevsner 's Buildings of England as " magnificent ... a very fine example of the royal masons ' work of the period . " It is a massive structure of two large D @-@ shaped towers flanking a wide gate passage 14 @.@ 8 m ( 48 ft ) long , and linked above by a large room . This sort of gatehouse is sometimes termed a keep @-@ gatehouse or gatehouse @-@ keep because of the massive size and defences on both the inner and outer sides of the building . The first gatehouse of this sort was built at Caerphilly Castle ; other examples exist in North Wales and at Tonbridge Castle . Uniquely , St Briavels ' gatehouse is protected with three sets of portcullises – although some gatehouses , such as Harlech and Beaumaris Castle were built for slots for three , they were only installed with two . A notable feature is the existence of smaller portcullises to defend the doorways from the passage to the porters ' lodges . The gatehouse was originally taller than it is today and the entrance would also have included a drawbridge , removed during the 20th century . 
 The base of the gatehouse is defended from undermining by large " spurs " . This design feature is characteristic of castles in the Welsh Marches , including Goodrich and Tonbridge Castle , but unlike these castles depends on a solid octagonal , rather than square , based interacting with the form of the circular towers . The gatehouse is well defended , except for the upper windows at the rear ; the upper floors were designed for high status guests and these windows would have provided adequate light for the chambers . The south @-@ east of the gatehouse is relatively modern , however , having been rebuilt after a past collapse .

 St Briavels Castle appears to date from Norman times , although the village itself predates the Norman period . The area was acquired by William FitzOsbern , the first Earl of Hereford in 1067 , who built a number of castles across the region , including Chepstow , Monmouth , Clifford and Wigmore . It does not appear that FitzOsbern built a castle on the St Briavels site , however , and the revolt of FitzOsbern 's son , Roger de Breteuil resulted in the village being taken into the possession of the royal bailiffs of the Forest of Dean . 
 St Briavels Castle was constructed sometime between 1075 and 1129 by royal mandate , although the precise date is uncertain . Walter de Gloucester , the Sheriff of Gloucester and his son Miles de Gloucester made St Briavels Castle the administrative centre of the Forest of Dean . The location of the castle placed it well behind the English border , in an area with little Welsh presence before the invasion , and it therefore appears to have been established for the purposes of royal governance , rather than to protect the Welsh Marches to its west . Equivalents elsewhere in the south @-@ west include Restormel Castle and Lydford Castle in Devon and Cornwall , both regional royal administrative centres . One alternative view , however , sees St Briavels as intended to protect the Severn estuary to the south , along with the royal castles of Bristol and Gloucester . This early castle was of motte and bailey design , the keep probably of wood . 
 Miles and his partner Pain fitzJohn strengthened their hold on the Welsh border during the last years of Henry I , but after the king 's death in 1135 England descended into the civil war of the Anarchy , as factions loyal to King Stephen and the Empress Matilda fought for control of the country . Fitz John was killed early in the fighting , but Miles declared in favour of Matilda and took control of the castle in his own right . In 1141 the Empress confirmed Miles as the Earl of Hereford and formally granted him St Briavels Castle . Under Miles , the castle escaped the worst of the fighting of the Anarchy . Miles ' son , Roger Fitzmiles continued to hold the castle into the reign of Henry II , the empress ' son , but a confrontation with the king resulted in it being removed from the earldom and taken back into royal ownership , once again as part of the Forest of Dean . Henry II rebuilt the castle keep in the 1160s , replacing the older wooden structure with stone . 
 Royal forests in the early medieval period were subject to special royal jurisdiction ; forest law was " harsh and arbitrary , a matter purely for the King 's will " . Forests were expected to supply the king with hunting grounds , raw materials , goods and money . The Forest of Dean could be used for hunting , but was more important to the king as a major metalworking centre , thanks to the plentiful supply of trees for making charcoal and the iron deposits in the limestone stone of the region . The iron goods constructed locally were stored at the castle before being shipped to other royal locations . The quantities being produced were substantial – in 1172 , for example , Henry II received 100 axes , 1 @,@ 000 picks , 2 @,@ 000 shovels and 60 @,@ 000 nails from St Briavel Castle . Richard I took 50 @,@ 000 horseshoes on crusade with him from St Briavel . The constable of St Briavel Castle had wide ranging responsibilities within the Forest , including managing the rights and privileges of the iron @-@ workers , exercised through the Miners ' and the Hundreds Court of the castle . 
 = = = 13th century = = = 
 King John enjoyed regular hunting in the Forest each November , and used St Briavels Castle as his base for such trips . The king entertained the Welsh lord <unk> ap Cadwallon at the castle in 1207 . This royal interest resulted in further building works and substantial expenditure , with £ 291 being spent in the next four years . A stone curtain wall replaced an earlier wooden one between 1209 – 11 , complete with a tower and gateway . Inside the bailey a number of buildings suitable for use by the king as a lodge were constructed . A wooden chapel was built within the castle in 1236 – 7 . The castle expansion may have been funded by the increased taxes from iron @-@ working across the areas , and by the end of John 's reign , the castle was almost in its mature form . 
 In 1217 the Charter of the Forest was passed , in part to mitigate the worst excesses of royal jurisdiction . The forest laws , however , did allow for a very wide range of fines to be imposed on local peasants who broke the numerous edicts in place to protect both wildlife and the trees in the forest . The courts held at St Briavels Castle imposed a relatively large number of fines , or amercements , for both illegal wood @-@ cutting and the poaching of venison during the period . The castle also began to be used a prison shortly afterwards , partially for forest trespassers and for those who could not pay the required fines . 
 After King John 's death , however , St Briavels Castle became the primary centre for English quarrel manufacture . The crossbow was an important military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon by the time of Richard I – many crossbows and even more quarrels were needed to supply royal forces . Crossbows were primarily built at the Tower of London , but St Briavels Castle , with the local forest to provide raw materials , became the national centre for quarrel manufacture . 
 In 1228 John <unk> , William the Smith and William the Fletcher arrived at the castle and began production operations at a forge built within the bailey . A production level of 120 @,@ 000 quarrels in a 120 @-@ day period was achieved by 1233 , with men like <unk> being able to produce up to 100 quarrels a day . Quarrels were then put into barrels and shipped across the kingdom in large quantities . Other iron from the castle was sent to build siege engines in Hereford . The manufacturing capability of St Briavels Castle gave the king a distinct advantage over potential baronial enemies , with the supply of arms from the castle to Marcher Lords threatened by the Welsh being one of the levers of royal power during the period . 
 Now a centre for arms manufacture , the castle was made more secure , with a new defensive ditch , freshly repaired walls and a new chapel . The castle was garrisoned with royal troops during the uprising of Richard Marshal against Henry III in 1233 – 4 , suggesting it had considerable military value at this time . Another indicator of the military importance of the castle and the surrounding forest was the £ 20 fee each year being paid to the constable of the castle by 1287 , on a par with the much larger castles of Rhuddlan or Nottingham . 
 Under Edward I , the massive gatehouse was built to protect the castle entrance , including special protection against undermining . There has been speculation that the royal architect James of Saint George may have been responsible for the building work , which occurred between 1292 – 3 at a cost of £ 477 . The reason for the king extending the castle at this time is unclear , as the castle was relatively far from the Welsh border and in no particular risk of attack . One popular explanation is that given the quantities of weapons and money being stored at the property by this time , the gatehouse was designed to improve the internal security of the castle ; the presence of the additional portcullises would also support this explanation . In 1300 , the old wooden chapel was rebuilt in stone and in 1310 , an extension to the castle wall was constructed at a cost of £ 40 ; called ' the Peel ' , this followed the line of the old motte and gave additional protection to the keep . 
 = = = 14th – 17th centuries = = = 
 St Briavels Castle remained an important location in the reign of Edward II , as the Welsh Marches were a key region in the wars between the king , his favourites and various noble factions during the period . Roger d 'Amory was the constable of the castle during the early years of Edward 's reign . D 'Amory was a royal favourite and Edward II visited the Castle several times , with an extensive renovation of the rooms and quarters occurring during this time . Around £ 500 was spent on the work , a substantial sum . 
 D 'Amory was supplanted in the king 's favour by Hugh Despenser the Younger , and d 'Amory fought against the king in the Despenser War of 1321 @-@ 22 . After the war , Edward placed the Marches under the control of the Despensers , with Hugh Despenser the Elder taking particular responsibility for St Briavels . The Despensers appointed Robert <unk> as the keeper of St Briavels and the other confiscated castles across the Marches . Violence began to break out across the region in response to the Despenser 's harsh rule , and <unk> 's deputy was attacked in July 1325 on his way back from St Briavels Castle to London ; his eyes were torn out , his arms and legs broken and all his records and money stolen . Edward and the Despensers were deposed shortly afterwards by Edward 's wife , Isabella of France . Isabella set about expanding her own lands after her victory , and took St Briavels Castle and various other royal castles into her own possession . When Isabella herself was overthrown by her son , Edward III , in 1330 the castle then reverted to the crown . 
 Towards the end of the 14th century , England saw increasing conflict between the rival Yorkist and Lancastrian factions . St Briavels Castle passed back and forth between the senior nobility on either side , but without playing a major part in the conflict itself . The castle was initially given to King Edward 's son Thomas , Duke of Gloucester ; with the fall of Thomas from favour after his uprising against Richard II , Thomas le Despenser received a life grant of the castle in 1397 , as part of his reward for serving Richard . With Thomas ' own fall from power under Henry IV , the castle was then given to Henry 's son , the Duke of Bedford . Henry Beauchamp , the Duke of Warwick and a close friend of Henry IV , then acquired St Briavels Castle and the Forest of Dean around 1445 . William Herbert was rewarded with the castle in 1467 for his support for Edward IV and the Yorkist faction during the Wars of the Roses ; he was then executed by the Lancastrian Richard Neville , Earl of Warwick , who took the castle for his own . Warwick died himself at the Battle of Barnet in 1471 , but after being briefly held by Robert <unk> , Henry VII restored St Briavels Castle to Neville 's widow , Anne Neville , 16th Countess of Warwick . With Anne 's death in 1492 , the castle passed into the control of Thomas Baynham . 
 By this time , however , St Briavels Castle had been in a slow period of decline for many years , similar to that of several other royal castles in the region , including Bristol and Gloucester . Minor improvements were made , including various light windows added to the internal buildings in the 15th century , and extensive restyling of the chapel in the 17th century , but not to the extent of those castles successfully converted to more luxurious dwellings . 
 Under James I and Charles the castle was traditionally granted to the Earls of Pembroke . By the time of the English Civil War , St Briavels Castle was held by Philip Herbert , the 4th earl and a friend of the king 's . Philip Herbert sided with Parliament , however , and St Briavels ' played little part in the conflict . With the Restoration and the return of Charles II to power in 1660 , the castle was removed from the Earls of Pembroke and given instead to Henry , Lord Herbert of Raglan for life . After Henry 's death , Duke of Beaufort was granted the property ; after the disgrace of the Duke of Beaufort a few years later , the castle changed hands again , with the subsequent owners being more modest figures in English public life than had been the case in previous years .

 In the 18th century many of the buildings inside the bailey were knocked down and the more valuable materials , including the lead from the roof , recycled . The keep partially collapsed in 1752 , with the remainder falling down in 1777 . Victorian writers blamed both the progress of time and the theft of stones by local peasants for the collapse . The famous " forester 's horn " chimney was moved from its original location to the west side of the building between 1783 and 1824 . Whilst not achieving the picturesque status of other ruined castes in the area , Georgian visitors noted the " beautiful and romantic scenery that surrounds these ruins " . 
 The castle was now principally a prison and a court , still operating under the authority of the constable and the Forest Law originally established in 1217 . The remaining buildings inside the bailey were converted into a courtroom and jury room , with the west side of the gatehouse being used as a jail for detaining prisoners . St Briavels Castle was primarily a debtors ' prison – in England up until the Debtors ' Act of 1869 , individuals unable to pay their debts or fines could be detained in prison indefinitely to encourage payment . The conditions in the castle prison became increasingly notorious after a visit from the prison reformer John Howard in 1775 as part of his research for the first edition of his book The State of the Prisons , published two years later . Howard found the prison " greatly out of repair " , with the two inmates locked in a single room without exercise for the best of a year , with no fresh water , financial support or firewood . Graffiti on the stone walls of the castle jail includes the mournful inscription by a prisoner of the period " For I have been here a great space ; And I am weary of the place . " 
 In 1831 there were extensive riots in the Forest of Dean , led by Warren James . After the intervention of the military , the rioters were dispersed and order restored , but a range of complaints were levied about the enforcement of the local laws on miners and metal @-@ workers . There had been attacks against St Briavels Castle by discontented locals before during the 1780s , but the degree of violence in this case was much greater . An act of Parliament followed , establishing a number of commissioners who investigated local practices and recent events at the Castle . 
 The debtors ' prison at the castle came in for particular scrutiny . It emerged that out of the 402 cases brought before the court at St Briavels ' Castle , 397 of them were for extremely small sums of debt of £ 5 or less ( £ 373 in 2009 prices ) , increasingly unacceptable in Victorian eyes . A penalty of up to £ 7 ( £ 522 in 2009 prices ) was also being charged for each case , making the process extremely onerous for the local poor being prosecuted in this way . The investigation found that the keeper of the debtors ' prison , which could hold up to six inmates at a time , was appointed by the constable , and made part of his income by charging each prisoner one shilling a week for the use of the beds in the prison ; with no other public funding , prisoners depended on friends or relatives for food and other essentials , or from donations from their original parishes . 
 The castle prison was found to still be in a very bad condition . The commissioners noted how the prison had " only one window , which is one foot wide and in a recess . It does not open .... There is a door at the outer end of the passage , and in it a hole which is considered necessary for air ... The privy is a dark winding recess ... It leads to a hole going down to the bottom of the building , which is always inaccessible for cleaning , but which until six years ago had a drain from it to the moat ; the air draws up from it into the passage and the room . There is no water within for the prisoners ' liberty , and they are obliged to get some person to fetch it . " 
 Prison reforms followed , including improving the conditions of the castle facilities , although visitors continued to note how the castle was " patched and cobbled like a worn @-@ out shoe " . In 1838 the role of constable was transformed into the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests . The court and jury rooms were turned into a local school , although occasional Courts of Attachment were held in the chapel and the castle retained its function as a prison until 1842 , when the remaining inmates were transferred to the prison at Littledean .

 The gatehouse and the buildings inside the bailey were made habitable again in 1906 and became a Youth Hostel in 1948 . In 1961 the moat was partly infilled and turned into a garden . The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument . The site as a whole remains open to the public , managed by English Heritage . 
 = Lake Untersee = 
 Lake Untersee ( German : Untersee , " Lower Lake " ) is the largest surface freshwater lake in the interior of the Gruber Mountains of central Queen Maud Land in East Antarctica . It is situated 90 kilometres ( 56 mi ) to the southwest of the Schirmacher Oasis . The lake is approximately 6 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 0 mi ) long and 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) wide , with a surface area of 11 @.@ 4 square kilometres ( 4 @.@ 4 sq mi ) , and a maximum depth of 169 metres ( 554 ft ) . The lake is permanently covered with ice and is partly bounded by glacier ice . 
 Lake Untersee is an unusual lake , with pH between 9 @.@ 8 and 12 @.@ 1 , dissolved oxygen at 150 percent supersaturation , and very low primary production in the water column . Despite the high oxygen supersaturation in most of the lake , there is a small sub @-@ basin at the southern end that is anoxic and its sediments may have a higher methane concentration than those of any other known lake on Earth . Much of the primary production is in microbial communities that grow on the floor of the lake as stromatolites . The water temperature varies between 0 @.@ 5 ° C ( 32 @.@ 9 ° F ) and 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) and the ice cover on the lake is 2 – 6 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 – 19 @.@ 7 ft ) thick . The ice cover may have persisted for over 100 @,@ 000 years , and some scientists studying climate change fear significant environmental changes associated with global warming in the coming decades . In the past , the water chemistry of the lake has been compared to Clorox . However , the chemical activity of bleach is due to Cl − in addition to a pH that is higher than that measures in Lake Untersee , and Lake Untersee does not have high chlorine or chlorite concentrations .

 Lake Untersee lies in the interior of the Gruber Mountains of central Queen Maud Land in East Antarctica , which is roughly on the same longitude as <unk> , in the Skeleton Coast National Park on the northern coast of Namibia . It is situated 90 kilometres ( 56 mi ) to the southwest of the Schirmacher Oasis . 
 The lake is approximately 6 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 0 mi ) long and 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) wide and has a surface area of 11 @.@ 4 square kilometres ( 4 @.@ 4 sq mi ) ( 10 square kilometres ( 3 @.@ 9 sq mi ) is also reported ) . Its maximum depth is 169 metres ( 554 ft ) . It is permanently covered with ice , which has an average thickness of 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) in summer . The lake is dammed by the <unk> Glacier , and meltwater from the <unk> Glacier is the main source of water . The lake has no outlet . Water is lost through sublimation and ablation of the ice cover . The lake is categorized as an ultra @-@ oligotrophic lake . 
 = = History = = 
 Isotope studies have established that the lake has long had a permanent ice cover . Further , studies carried out during the austral summer confirm the lake 's homogeneous characteristics , with thermal convection as the reason given for its hydro @-@ geochemical and <unk> nature . It is replenished perennially by a process of underwater melting of the adjacent glacier ice . It is also stated that the lake existed during the Holocene period when it emerged from a melt @-@ water pond . 
 Studies of Lake Untersee have revealed that there are a number of large boulders which dam the lake . Geodetic studies carried out during two summer seasons indicated that the boulders move at an annual rate of 1 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 9 metres ( 3 @.@ 6 – 12 @.@ 8 ft ) . Residence time of the boulders has been estimated as 500 years . The floating boulders , which are several metres in diameter , have evolved as result of debris deposits from pro @-@ glacial interaction , mass wasting from hills surrounding the lake and the displacement of glacial ice by lake ice . 
 The lake was first discovered by the German Antarctic Expedition of 1938 – 39 . After that , several expeditions have studied the lake 's characteristics . The first reconnaissance study of the lake was carried out by N. G. <unk> and D. D. <unk> in early 1969 , followed by more studies by Russian and German scientists , namely by W. D. <unk> et al . ( 1985 ) , E. <unk> et al . ( 1988 ) and A. <unk> et al . ( 1988 ) .

 In studies carried out prior to 1991 – 92 on physical and chemical parameters of the lake water , Lake Untersee was stated to be well @-@ mixed and <unk> . However , studies performed in the summer of 1991 – 92 found significant stratification in a 500 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) wide trough in the southeastern part of the lake , where it is up to 105 metres ( 344 ft ) deep . There were sharp vertical gradients of temperature , pH , dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity . While a thermocline was recorded at a depth between 40 metres ( 130 ft ) and 50 metres ( 160 ft ) , an <unk> followed at 70 – 80 metres ( 230 – 260 ft ) , with a <unk> extending from 80 metres ( 260 ft ) to bottom of the lake . Below 80 metres ( 260 ft ) , the water column was anoxic and smelled of hydrogen sulfide . The presence of hydrogen sulfide was associated with decreased sulfate concentrations , indicating that it probably arose from bacterial reduction of sulfate . 
 The salt content of the upper levels of the lake is about 50 times that of glacial melt water . Salinity increased below 80 metres ( 260 ft ) , with sodium ion concentration and electrolytic conductivity more than doubling . The lake is highly alkaline ( pH 10 @.@ 4 ) down to a depth of 70 metres ( 230 ft ) ; below this depth , pH drops , reaching the slightly acidic value of 6 @.@ 1 at maximum depth . The proportion of methane in the sediment at the lake bottom is the highest recorded for any lake in the world , according to NASA scientists . 
 In 2008 , as part of the Tawani Foundation 2008 Antarctic International Expedition ( see below ) , Dale Andersen and Ian Hawes discovered conical stromatolites growing in Lake Untersee , the largest living ones known to date . Small microbial pinnacles are also present , and it appears that the large conical stromatolites and the small pinnacles are made by different microbial communities . These communities provide an important analog to some of the oldest fossil stromatolites found to date .

 In November and December 2008 , the " Tawani Foundation 2008 Antarctic International Expedition " headed by Richard Hoover of NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center used the lake as a test bed in its hunt for extreme life . Conditions in the lake are similar in some respects to those thought to exist on other moons and planets that contain water ice and methane ; thus , this lake might provide an analog to environments that exist elsewhere in space . The expedition did find several new strains of extremophile microorganisms in the lake 's waters , including a <unk> that metabolises hydrogen . 
 This expedition involved an interdisciplinary international team of ten scientists and two teachers who explored not only Lake Untersee but also the Schirmacher Oasis . The <unk> aspects of this expedition had three objectives : " to test laser induced fluorescence emission ( <unk> ) to be used for the exploration of the Mars regolith and poles ; monitor global climate change ; and to evaluate methods for detecting hydrocarbon contamination and subsequent bio @-@ remediation in a fragile , endangered ecosystem . " The results indicate that Lake Untersee , as a permanently ice @-@ covered region , has very little usable soil and could be likened to the polar regions of Mars . 
 Experiments conducted have examined the metagenomes of eukaryotes ; identified Prokaryotes and viruses inhabiting the lake ; provided evidence of virus @-@ mediated horizontal gene transfer and adaptive metabolic or cold protective phenotype alterations , identified microbial nanowire connections between multiple species at the ice @-@ water interface , in the water column , and in the sediment ; and established biomass estimates of life in the lake ice during the early spring growing season using laser @-@ induced fluorescence emission ( <unk> ) imaging techniques . 
 Two scientific divers were also part of this team . Dale Andersen , with the SETI Institute 's Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe , and Ian Hawes of Aquatic Research Solutions dove in Lake Untersee to study its unique microbial communities . 
 = History of Baltimore City College = 
 The history of The Baltimore City College began in March 1839 , when the City Council of Baltimore , Maryland , United States , passed a resolution mandating the creation of a male high school with a focus on the study of English and classical literature . The Baltimore City College was opened later in the same year on October 20 , with 46 pupils under the direction of Professor Nathan C. Brooks , ( 1809 @-@ 1898 ) , a local noted classical educator and poet , who became the first principal . It is now considered to be the third oldest public high school in the nation . In 1850 , the Baltimore City Council granted the school the authority to present its graduates with certificates of completion . An effort to expand that academic power and allow the then named " Central High School of Baltimore " to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees began in 1865 , and continued the following year with the renaming of the institution as " The Baltimore City College " , which it still holds to this day , with also the retitling of its chief academic officer from " principal " to " president " , along with an increase in the number of years of its course of study and the expansion of its courses . However , despite this early elevation effort , it ended at that time unsuccessfully in 1869 , although the B.C.C. continued for a number of years as a hybrid public high school and early form of junior college ( later known as community college ) which did not fully appear in America until the beginning of the 20th Century . Very often the graduation diploma in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries was accepted by many other colleges and universities entitling City graduates to enter upper @-@ division schools at the sophomore year , ( which was also coincidentally a privilege also accorded to its later local academic and athletic rival , the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute , founded 1883 ) . 
 As the importance of higher education increased in the early 20th Century , the High School 's priorities shifted to preparing students for college . In 1927 , the academic program was further changed , when the City College divided its curriculum into two tracks : the standard college preparatory program , or " ' B ' Course " , and a more rigorous " Advanced College Prep " curriculum , the famed " ' A ' Course " of study ( also available in the mathematics / science / technology fields at Poly ) . 
 The school underwent demographic changes following the U.S. Supreme Court 's unanimous ruling in the May 1954 decision " Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka , Kansas " case that called for an end to racial segregation . African Americans joined City College for the first time at the end of that summer , in September 1954 and became a significant proportion of the student population by the 1960s . Mr. Pierre H. Davis , also later became the first " Negro " / " Colored " teacher to join the B.C.C. faculty the following year , who coincidentally became the first Afro @-@ American principal in 1970 . The school saw further changes in the student population with the admission of women in 1978 . 
 Academic standards and enrollment at the Baltimore City College ( B.C.C. ) went through a period of decline first in the mid 1960s to mid 1970s . The ' A ' and ' B ' courses were slowly dying out and unfortunately discontinued by 1973 , and a single academic track was offered . 
 After another period of neglect in the late 1980s and early 1990s , by the mid @-@ 1990s , with an increase in funding from the school system , the B.C.C. began to experience a turnaround . Administrators re @-@ strengthened academic standards and , in 1998 , the school began offering the International Baccalaureate ( IB ) Diploma Program . By the beginning of the decade of the 2000s , City College was experiencing an academic resurgence . During this period the school was recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as a National Blue Ribbon School , was listed as one of the top high schools in the United States by Newsweek . 
 = = Early years = = 
 The creation of a male high school " in which the higher branches of English and classical literature should be taught exclusively " was authorized unanimously by the Baltimore City Council on March 7 , 1839 . A townhouse of probably two stories with a sloped roof and dormer window structure on what was then known as Courtland Street ( now east side of " Preston Gardens " , built in the late 1910s with terraced and <unk> flower beds with shrubs and monumental staircases along St. Paul Street and St. Paul Place , of five square blocks between East Centre Street in the north and East Lexington Street to the south , as Baltimore 's first downtown " urban renewal " project , which unfortunately resulted in the razing of hundreds of beautiful , but run @-@ down , then neglected Federal , Georgian , and Greek Revival architecture @-@ styled townhomes and classical business structures that would be considered to be saved under the " historic preservation " standards today ) was acquired to serve as the home of the new high school . The school opened its doors that Fall on October 20 , 1839 with 46 students . Enrollment was restricted to white , male students of Baltimore City who had completed grammar school and passed an entrance exam . Additional student applicants from the surrounding rural ( and later suburban ) Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County were considered upon payment of tuition to the Baltimore City Public Schools system Those enrolled were offered two academic tracks , a classical literature track and an English literature track . The sole instructor for both tracks was the educator and poet , Nathan C. Brooks , who also served as principal . To accommodate the two tracks , Brooks split the school day into two sections : one in the morning from 9 am to 12 am , and another in the afternoon from 2 pm to 5 pm . During the morning session , students studied either classics or English ; however , the afternoon was devoted to English . 
 In its first three years , the school was housed in many locations before returning to the original townhouse building on Courtland Street . In 1843 , the City Council allocated $ 23 @,@ 000 to acquire a building for the school at the northeastern corner of East Fayette and Holliday Streets , ( across the street from the later Baltimore City Hall , constructed 1867 @-@ 1875 ) , and the site of the present War Memorial Plaza , constructed 1917 @-@ 1925 ) . The renovated new school building was the former old " Assembly Rooms " , a Greek Revival architecture civic landmark , built in 1797 by architects Robert Cary Long , Sr. and Col. Nicholas Rogers ( ancestor owner of the estate which became Druid Hill Park ) to accommodate social events for Baltimore 's social elite at the Baltimore Dancing Assembly , which had begun in the <unk> and the site of the first private library company of Baltimore . The school was next door to the famous Holliday Street Theatre , where the poem " The Defence of Fort McHenry " , now known as the " Star Spangled Banner " written by Frederick and Georgetown lawyer and amateur poet , Francis Scott Key , ( 1779 @-@ 1843 ) , was first performed on its stage in October and November 1814 , following the Battle of Baltimore , with the British Royal Navy and Army attack on Baltimore during the War of 1812 , ( now known as " Defenders ' Day " ) on September 12 @-@ 13 @-@ 14 , 1814 . Although it was not designed to house an academic institution , the school would occupy this building for 30 years . 
 The male high school for Baltimore went through the first of a series of name changes in 1844 . First known and founded in 1839 as " The High School " , it was renamed the " Male High School " because of the establishment of two schools for females — Eastern and Western High Schools , which opened in November of that year . 
 In 1849 , after a decade of service , Prof. Brooks resigned as principal of the school , which had now grown to include 232 students and 7 teachers , excluding Brooks . Rev. Dr. Francis G. Waters , who had been the president of the Washington College , on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in Chestertown , succeeded Brooks . The following year the city council renamed the school " The Central High School of Baltimore " and granted the commissioners of the public schools the right to confer certificates to the high school 's graduates . Exercising that new authority , the new <unk> of B. held its first commencement ceremony in 1851 with noted local philosopher , author and civic leader Severn Teackle Wallis , ( 1816 @-@ 1894 ) , as the guest speaker , ( Wallis has a bronze statue to his memory and many city accomplishments at the eastern end from the Washington Monument of Mount Vernon Place / East Monument Street facing the intersection with St. Paul Street . This bolstered enrollment in the school , as students were drawn by the prospect of receiving a certificate attesting to their level of education . That year 156 students applied to the school — an increase of 50 students . 
 The growing enrollment necessitated a reorganization of the school . Under the direction of Waters , the school day was divided into eight periods lasting forty @-@ five minutes : four sessions were held in the morning and four in the afternoon . In addition to reorganizing the schedule , he divided the courses into seven different departments : Belles @-@ letters and history , mathematics , natural sciences , moral , mental , and political science , ancient languages , modern languages and music . Each of the seven instructors was assigned to a distinct department and received the title of " professor " .

 In 1865 , in accordance with a recommendation from the board of commissioners of the Baltimore City public schools , City College began offering a five @-@ year track , beginning a process aimed at elevating the school to a college and allowing it to grant its graduates degrees . To further these aims , the school was renamed " The Baltimore City College " ( BCC ) by an act of the city council on October 9 , 1866 . That same year , the board of commissioners recommended that the city council make a formal proposal to the Maryland General Assembly to grant City College the authority to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees to its graduates . According to the 38th Annual Report of the Board of Commissioners of the Public Schools to the Mayor and City Council , the elevation of the school was designed to " afford advantages to students ... who may adopt the profession of teacher as a pursuit of life . " Thus , the elevation was intended to provide qualified teachers for the Baltimore school system . However , the city council never acted on this recommendation and though the school changed nominally , it was never truly granted the power of a college . Not only did the city council fail to make the recommendation to the general assembly , but it also failed to adequately maintain the facilities of the school . In the 43rd Annual Report of the Board of Commissioners of the Public Schools to the Mayor and City Council , the president of the board wrote : 
 In addition , the president of the board again requested that the city council attempt to elevate the status of City College , " so that it shall be placed on equal footing in all respects to that of a first class collegiate institution , " but no action was taken . Since there was no incentive to pursue the five @-@ year track , no student remained at the school for the extra year of study and the course was abandoned in 1869 . 
 = = Relocation = = 
 It was not until 1873 , when a fire spread from the Holliday Street Theatre to the " Assembly Rooms , " that the city council finally decided to expend the resources to erect a new building for the school . The city council acquired a lot on Howard Street opposite Centre Street and allocated $ 150 @,@ 000 for the construction of the new building . During the construction , City College was housed in a building of the Baltimore Female College , where it remained until its new English Gothic revival @-@ style building was dedicated on February 1 , 1875 . While at the Baltimore Female College , the five @-@ year course was reintroduced and the four @-@ year track was eliminated . That allowed students to pursue advanced courses , which included calculus , political economy , logic and higher @-@ level language courses , which were emphasized in the curriculum . Students were expected to learn Latin , French , and German ; and Greek was offered as an optional course . 
 In 1876 , ceremonies were held in the adjacent Academy of Music for the new Johns Hopkins University , which had established several buildings alongside City College under its first president , Daniel Coit Gilman . Four graduates of City College entered Hopkins as a part of the first undergraduate class . That same year BCC 's academic program underwent further changes with the introduction of a one @-@ year track , which provided an opportunity for students who could not complete the entire course of study because they needed to enter the labor market . Courses in the one @-@ year track focused on providing students with pragmatic skills , such as " book @-@ keeping " , " commercial arithmetic " , and " business correspondence " . 
 City College 's first extracurricular activity , the Bancroft Literary Association , was established the same year to provide a forum for student debate . A second debating society , the Carrollton Society , was established in 1878 . One of the first athletic teams appeared the following year , when a group of students organized a lacrosse team — the first at a public high school . The establishment of Baltimore Polytechnic Institute ( Poly ) in 1883 was an important development for City College 's athletics program . With the founding of Poly , City College acquired an arch rival in academics and sports — particularly football . The schools have met annually in a football clash since 1889 . The formal organization of an athletic program at BCC did not begin until 1895 . During the early years of the athletic program , City College played chiefly against college teams because few other secondary schools existed in Maryland . City College 's 1895 football schedule included St. John 's College , Swarthmore College , the United States Naval Academy , University of Maryland , and Washington College . 
 = = Reconstruction = = 
 City College 's Tudor and Gothic @-@ style building , designed by Baltimore City Hall architect George A Frederick , lasted until 1892 , when it was undermined by the construction of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tunnel from Camden Station to Mount Royal Station , and collapsed . Several years of political in @-@ fighting and the change to a reformist city administration delayed construction of a new structure . Designed by the architects Baldwin and Pennington , the new structure was not completed until 1899 . 
 The succeeding year , the only time since 1851 , the school did not hold a commencement . Members of the senior class had decided to make fun of the professors in the Green Bag — City College 's year book since 1896 . When the school board was alerted of the matter , it attempted to censor the edition , passing a resolution requiring the Green Bag to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper . However , the year book had already been printed , and the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted . The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors of the Green Bag and the business manager , and by preventing the school from holding a commencement ceremony . One of the boys expelled , Clarence Keating Bowie , became a member of the school board in 1926 . 
 In 1901 , the course of study at City College went through a series of further changes . The most significant was the reduction of the five @-@ year course of study to four years ; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five @-@ year course . The new course , like the course it replaced , allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination , and provided students with greater flexibility . Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses , it allowed students to choose their courses , as long as they completed 150 credits . 
 The program 's explicit purpose was to provide special preparation for those wishing to attend college because of the increasing significance of college education . Though specific classes were not required , to meet the goal , students were required to complete courses in English literature and composition , four foreign languages , mathematics , science , history , commerce , drawing , music , and physical culture . 
 = = " Castle on the Hill " = = 
 By World War I , attendance in the school was rapidly increasing . An annex was added on 26th Street to alleviate overcrowding in the Howard Street building , but it was insufficient . Therefore , during the 1920s , alumni began campaigning to provide a proper building for the school , and in 1926 , ground was broken for a massive Collegiate Gothic stone castle with a 38 @-@ acre ( 153 @,@ 781 m ² ) campus , on a hill in the newly annexed northeastern suburbs at 33rd Street and The Alameda . The four @-@ level " Castle on the Hill " , which was surmounted by a 150 ft ( 46 m ) tower and designed by architects Buckler and Fenhagen , cost almost $ 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 and accommodated 2 @,@ 500 students . The " castle " featured arched windows and cornices , cloisters , gargoyles , stained glass , mahogany paneling , plaster arches , chandeliers and terra cotta tiles and terrazzo floors with two courtyards and plans for additional wings and buildings . 
 The following year , in 1927 , the " Advanced Academic Course " ( " A " Course ) was introduced . Students in the " A " Course were able to enter their second year of college following their graduation . This program of study and its counterpart , the college preparatory course ( " B " Course ) , became the backbone of City College 's academic program for over 60 years . On April 10 , 1928 , after nearly two years of construction , " The Castle on the Hill " opened its doors to the students and faculty . The next year , the students published the first edition of The Collegian , City College 's newspaper . The publication quickly became an indispensable part of student life and gained national attention , when it won second place in a contest sponsored by the Columbia Scholastic Press Association of Columbia University . The Collegian held the first place title between 1935 – 1939 . 
 When Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 led to U.S. entry into World War II , blood donor projects , stamp and bond drives , and the dedication of service flags gave the City College a wartime atmosphere . More than three @-@ quarters of the students participated in the Victory Corps , which sponsored courses in communications , map reading , judo and the study of the poisonous and non @-@ poisonous plants on Pacific islands . By the time the war ended in 1945 , 4 @,@ 667 City College students had served in the armed forces , 204 of whom lost their lives . The names of all of the fallen , including two Medal of Honor recipients , are inscribed on a bronze memorial , which sits today in the center of the school . 
 = = Integration = = 
 Following the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education , the Baltimore City board of school commissioners was forced to desegregate the school system , which had been racially divided since the 1860s . As a result , 10 African @-@ American students entered City College in September 1954 , comprising 0 @.@ 5 % of the student population . A decade later , in the 1964 – 65 academic year , African @-@ American students represented 30 % of the student population . 
 In 1956 the school system also sent two African @-@ American men to teach at the school : Eugene Parker , who coached for thirty years , and Pierre Davis , who left after one year but returned in 1971 as City College 's first African @-@ American principal . 
 Although African @-@ American enrollment increased , the transition from the segregated system was not seamless . In 1964 , enrollment in the selective " A " Course still skewed disproportionately to white students . Only six African Americans were enrolled that year compared with 110 Whites , and they were similarly underrepresented in extracurricular activities . 
 Such de facto segregation was a systemic problem in Baltimore throughout the 1960s . To address the problem , Superintendent Laurence G. Paquin proposed a reorganization of Baltimore 's high schools . He called for the creation of 13 comprehensive high schools that would offer both vocational training and college preparatory classes , and the elimination of multiple academic tracks in high school . However , Paquin 's proposal met stiff opposition from City College parents and alumni , who feared that his plan threatened the foundations of City College 's academic program . Councilman William Donald Schaefer , an alumnus of City College , convened a City Council hearing on the proposal , which stymied Paquin 's effort . 
 By the late 1970s , the school 's population , academic program , and building were all in decline , in part reflecting the economic problems of the city as a whole . In 1977 , the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program . That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College coeducational ; however , the all @-@ male tradition did not end easily . Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a single @-@ sex education system , and a task force studying the issue voted 11 – 6 in favor of keeping the all @-@ male tradition . In a stunning reversal , the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights . The following year City College enrolled women for the first time . 
 = = Recent history = = 
 By 1990 , the school 's academic program was once again deteriorating and enrollment was declining . The Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools raised questions about the ability of City College to offer students an academically rigorous course of study . During this period of decline , the " A " Course was discontinued by Principal Joseph Antenson , who contended that the program was racially discriminatory — an argument Paquin had made nearly three decades earlier — and opted for a standardized curriculum . However , the change did little to improve the school ; therefore , in 1992 , the school system hired a private contractor to run City College . That action was a part of the unsuccessful " Educational Alternatives program " , which lasted for about 14 months . Then , in 1994 , Joseph M. Wilson was appointed principal of City College . Wilson , with the aid of alumni and parents , was able to secure more funding and autonomy from the school system , which were used to redesign the curriculum and to introduce the IB Diploma Program in 1998 . 
 The new academic program attracted increased attention to the school . In 2000 , City College was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education , which placed it among the best schools in the country . The following year , the Toronto National Post reported on the two @-@ month @-@ long task of searching for the perfect high school in Great Britain , the United States , and Canada . It " never found the perfect school ... [ however ] we found a few outstanding ones , " the paper concluded . And one of these — the subject of a prominent feature article — was City College , led by Wilson . The school 's rankings in Newsweek 's report of the nation 's top high schools improved during this period . In 2003 , it was ranked 593 . Three years later , in 2006 , City College was ranked 206 , and in 2007 it was ranked 258 . Given an estimated 27 @,@ 500 public high schools across the nation , in 2007 ranking placed City College in the top one percent of all high schools . In its criteria , Newsweek divided the number of Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate tests taken by the number of graduating seniors . The magazine stated that the measure showed schools which were committed to helping students take college @-@ level courses . 
 In addition to the academic resurgence of the school , the building was recognized for its historical and architectural interest . The Castle on the Hill was honored in 2003 by being placed on the National Register of Historic Places . This designation coincided with the 75th anniversary of the structure and campus as well as City College 's 165th year of existence . On April 24 , 2007 it earned the additional distinction of being listed as a Baltimore City Landmark . Mayor Sheila Dixon stated that : " The castle on the hill , as City College is known , is truly a historic landmark . It is worthy of preservation and acknowledgment . " 
 The landmark status bill was passed by the city council in accordance with a recommendation made by the council 's staff , which found that the building dates from a historic and architecturally significant period . This new status prevents the building 's exterior from being altered without the approval of the city 's Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation . However , the previous year City College was a victim of vandalism at the hands of a group of children ranging in age from 8 to 15 , as a renovation of the school neared completion . In the summer of 2007 , scenes from the 2008 sequel Step Up 2 were filmed at City College . Interior and campus shots were used to form the fictional Maryland School for the Arts . 
 In 2007 controversy about the academic program arose , when members of the Baltimore City College Alumni Association argued that the IB Program was diverting a significant amount of the school 's resources to benefit a fraction of the student population . Approximately 30 students out of 1300 were enrolled in the full IB Diploma Program at City College . Some members also argued that the rigidity of the program did not give students enough flexibility . Citing these concerns , the alumni association encouraged the school to replace the IB Program with the " A course " and expand the number of Advanced Placement courses offered . In December 2008 City announced the donation of $ 50 @,@ 000 by alumnus H. Corbin Gwaltney ' 39 . The founder and longtime editor of Johns Hopkins Magazine , Gwaltney 's donation will benefit the modernization of City 's library . This is the second largest donation by a single alumnus to the school , David Rubenstein , founder of the Carlyle Group donated the largest amount — $ 100 @,@ 000 in 2006 .

 = Indoor @-@ outdoor thermometer = 
 An indoor @-@ outdoor thermometer is a thermometer that simultaneously provides a measurement of the indoor and outdoor temperatures . The outdoor part of the thermometer requires some kind of remote temperature sensing device . Conventionally , this was done by extending the bulb of the thermometer to the remote site . Modern instruments are more likely to use some form of electronic transducer . 
 = = Glass thermometer = = 
 In an indoor @-@ outdoor thermometer based on a conventional liquid @-@ in @-@ glass thermometer , the stem of the outdoor thermometer is connected to the bulb by a long , flexible or semi @-@ rigid capillary . The temperature scale is marked on the stem as usual . However , the temperature that is actually measured is the temperature at the bulb . 
 Ambient corrections are difficult to achieve with this system and are not usually done . Consequently , it is not as accurate as a conventional precision thermometer . Rather , it is typically used for low @-@ cost applications such as private houses . The main issue with accuracy is that if the bulb and the stem are at different levels , there is a change in reading due to the change in pressure head . A further problem is that changes in the ambient temperature of the indoor part of the device can cause a change in reading as well as the temperature of the outdoor part of the device . This effect can be minimised by making the bulb large and the capillary a small diameter . This ensures that changes in the outside temperature produce large changes in the column of liquid in the stem and will tend to swamp the smaller changes caused by the changes in the indoor temperature . 
 Common working liquids used are toluene and alcohol . Both of these have large temperature coefficients of expansion and do not freeze or boil in the temperature range of interest . 
 = = Electronic types = = 
 The sensors can be any of the types used in electronic thermometers . <unk> are common and semiconductor junctions can also be used . Indoor @-@ outdoor electronic thermometers are a frequent hobbyist project and are sometimes sold as kits . Many indoor @-@ outdoor thermometers on sale are wireless devices requiring no physical connection to the sensor placed outside . In these cases the sensor needs to be battery @-@ powered . 
 = = Applications = = 
 The primary purpose of the indoor @-@ outdoor thermometer is to allow the outside temperature to be indicated inside a building , thus removing the need to go outside to take a temperature reading . They are also used in vehicles , and are particularly useful for municipal vehicles involved in snow and ice clearance . Building maintenance engineers can use an indoor @-@ outdoor thermometer that has not been installed to get a quick reading of air temperature in a location inside a building . This is done by swinging the bulb of the outdoor sensor in the air while still attached to the instrument . This will get a faster reading because the bulb will come up to temperature much more quickly than the indoor sensor built into the instrument .

 " The Sue Sylvester Shuffle " is the eleventh episode of the second season of the American musical television series Glee , and the thirty @-@ third episode overall . It was written by Ian Brennan , directed by Brad Falchuk , and was broadcast immediately following Super Bowl XLV on February 6 , 2011 . In the episode , an effort to dispel student rivalry forces the McKinley High football team and glee club to unite . When cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) withdraws her squad from the halftime show of a championship football game , the disparate groups must come together to perform a routine and win the game . 
 Reportedly the most expensive post @-@ Super Bowl episode ever produced , " The Sue Sylvester Shuffle " cost $ 3 – 5 million . It featured over 500 extras , including an array of stunt artists . News anchor Katie Couric guest @-@ starred as herself , provoking controversy by making a jibe about television personality Dina Lohan . The episode featured cover versions of five songs , including a dance performance of " California Gurls " by Katy Perry and a mash @-@ up of Michael Jackson 's " Thriller " with " Heads Will Roll " by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs . Series creator Ryan Murphy had considered using the episode as a musical tribute to Jackson . The performances were met with mixed reception from critics . With the exception of " California Gurls " , each of the numbers were released as singles , available for download . The " Thriller / Heads Will Roll " mash @-@ up was the highest charting in all regions , peaking at number seventeen in Australia . 
 In the US , the episode was watched by 26 @.@ 8 million viewers , and was the highest @-@ rated scripted TV broadcast in three years . It received a mixed response from critics , who differed over its accessibility to the Super Bowl audience .

 " The Sue Sylvester Shuffle " is reported to be the most expensive post @-@ Super Bowl episode in television history , as well as the most expensive episode of Glee , costing $ 3 – $ 5 million . Filming was halted on December 10 , 2010 as a result of several cast members contracting tonsillitis . An outbreak of the flu soon followed , and filming of the " Thriller " performance was delayed by four weeks . The episode was co @-@ sponsored by General Motors , allowing for limited commercial breaks . The Glee cast featured in a two @-@ minute Chevrolet commercial during the episode . Based on the season one episode " Mattress " , they gave an in @-@ character performance of " See the USA in Your Chevrolet " . 
 Series creator Ryan Murphy intended " The Sue Sylvester Shuffle " to feel thematically similar to the pilot episode , with the central idea being " music bringing disparate people together . " Co @-@ creator Brad Falchuk explained that one of the series ' core conflicts had always been the idea of " two worlds " within McKinley High : the glee club and the popular students . He stated that this discord would be brought to a head in the episode . 
 News anchor Couric made a guest appearance in the episode as herself . She was a fan of the series prior to her casting , having praised its handling of subject matters such as homosexuality , disabilities and teenage pregnancy . Brian Stelter of The New York Times noted that her appearance was unusual , as anchors from rival networks — in Couric 's case , CBS — do not typically make cameos on their competitors ' programs . Series regular Chris Colfer and recurring guest star Darren Criss were not included in the original draft of the script , but were added by series creator Murphy in a late revision . Other recurring characters who appear are football coach Shannon Beiste , glee club members Mike Chang ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) , Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) and Lauren Zizes , cheerleader Becky Jackson ( Lauren Potter ) and school bullies Dave Karofsky and Azimio ( James Earl ) . Two new football @-@ playing characters were introduced : Scott Cooper and <unk> , who E ! columnist Kristin dos Santos reported might have an increased role in the series as it continued . However , they did not make any additional appearances on the show in its second season . Additionally , producers hired fire breathers , jugglers , and bicycle motocross stunt performers for the episode . 500 extras were used , as well as the University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band . In January 2011 , entertainment website Zap2it reported that Filipina singer Charice would appear as exchange student Sunshine Corazon , performing The Black Eyed Peas ' " Meet Me Halfway " with rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline . However , Murphy later stated that Charice would not return to Glee until the end of the year , though she ultimately also made an appearance before then in " A Night of Neglect " .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 The episode was met with mixed response from critics . Robert Bianco of USA Today found it lacking in plot and a driving moral , however felt that it was acceptable as a standalone episode – one which could be enjoyed by fans and new viewers alike . In contrast , Vicki Hyman of The Star @-@ Ledger commented that despite the football @-@ centric plot , the episode would be hard to follow for new viewers brought in by the Super Bowl , requiring too much knowledge of previous storylines . New York 's Willa Paskin felt that Murphy demonstrated " utter contempt " for the potential new audience . She suggested that the McKinley High football team were used as a metaphor for new viewers — who could come to love Glee if they embraced its musical numbers — but found this insulting as the team are portrayed as being ignorant and intolerant . Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic found the episode lacking in Glee 's " usual acerbic wit and emotional heft " , and criticized the under @-@ use of Colfer and Criss . 
 Highlighting a general malaise with the show , Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post deemed Sue 's boredom with cheerleading a meta @-@ reference to the series itself . Both she and Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club noted negatively the repetition of familiar storylines , such as the football team vs. glee club rivalry and Sue 's attempts to destroy the club . VanDerWerff observed that Glee " keeps tossing the same elements into the hat and coming out with similar results , as though the only thing anybody ’ s putting any effort into are the musical numbers . " He graded the episode a " C " , calling it " boring " . Time 's James Poniewozik also commented on the repetitive premise , suggesting that the jocks versus geeks plot was the one most likely to be accessible to the new audience . He found the episode " easily forgettable " overall , criticizing the flat characterization , but noted that even when the series frustrates him , he continues to love Glee for , not in spite of , its inconsistency . 
 IGN 's Robert Canning also found the long @-@ running football vs. glee storyline repetitive , but wrote that the football players joining glee club was " a welcome twist " , however convoluted and unrealistic . He rated the episode 8 / 10 , finding it " preposterously fun " . Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker considered the episode " at once in @-@ your @-@ face and under @-@ handed , very clever about its very cynicism . " He noted that while he had become jaded with Glee , he enjoyed " The Sue Sylvester Shuffle " , summarizing that , " Everything in this episode was chaotic and topsy @-@ turvy , but you never had the feeling the silliness was getting away from the producers . It all came together . " 
 Rick Porter of Zap2it criticized Katie Couric 's cameo for an attack made against Dina Lohan . During her interview with Sue , Couric lists Lohan and her dog Sparky as failed Loser of the Year contenders . In a previous episode , Glee also mocked Lohan 's daughter , Lindsay . Porter felt that the jibe diminished Couric 's journalistic credibility , deeming the <unk> easy targets . However , Canning called Couric 's cameo " perhaps the funniest part of the episode " , and de Moraes stated that the best line of the episode comes when Sue " looks Katie Couric right in the eye and says , ' I hate you , Diane Sawyer . ' " 
 The Daily News 's Soraya Roberts expressed relief that the writers were not gullible enough to have Karofsky end the episode by joining the glee club . Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times opined that Karofsky 's character development was the best element of the episode , but found his conflicted emotions convoluted , and was pleased that he was victimized by the hockey team .

 Murphy initially intended the episode to be the second of the season paying tribute to a single band or artist , following the Britney Spears tribute episode " Britney / Brittany " , and considered covering songs by Elton John , Prince , The Beatles , Bruce Springsteen or Michael Jackson . Although several artists agreed to a tribute , ultimately it was decided that songs by multiple acts would be covered . Katy Perry 's " California Gurls " was used as the opening number , performed as a dance routine by the school cheerleading squad , the Cheerios . Paying homage to Perry 's original music video , one element features the cheerleaders appearing to shoot fire from their breasts . Falchuk , the episode 's director , stated that the sequence was included to attract male Super Bowl viewers who would not ordinarily watch Glee . Rachel and Puck perform a duet of Lady Antebellum 's " Need You Now " , intended to showcase the merits of glee club . Finn leads a performance of The Zombies ' " She 's Not There " as the halftime show warm @-@ up number , and rival a cappella choir the Dalton Academy Warblers perform Destiny 's Child 's " Bills , Bills , Bills " , led by Blaine . A mash @-@ up of Jackson 's song " Thriller " with " Heads Will Roll " by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs was used as the final number . In early reports relating to the episode , Lynch claimed that Couric and Morrison would perform a dance number to " Tea for Two " , Vincent Youmans and Irving Caesar 's song from the 1925 musical No , No , Nanette . This rumor was later dispelled by Murphy .

 Musical performances also attracted mixed commentary . Though Perry was reportedly excited by the performance of her " California Gurls " , it was poorly received by critics . VanDerWerff found it surprisingly " weak and lifeless " , and Fallon called it " slow , unfunny , and , quite frankly , boring . " Reiter also deemed it boring , describing it as " an elaborate smorgasbord without flavor " , and Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman criticized the uninspired , over @-@ the @-@ top choreography . 
 The performance of " Need You Now " was praised by Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal , though he branded it a " disastrously tactless " song choice . Both he and Jenna Mullins of E ! Online questioned the likelihood of a country ballad enthusing the football players toward glee club . Entertainment Weekly 's Breia Brissey graded the performance " B + " , enjoying the union of Puck and Rachel , but finding it lacking in originality . She gave the same grade to " She 's Not There " , appreciating the way the song choice complemented the episode 's Finn / Quinn storyline . VanDerWerff also received the performance positively , calling it one of the season 's better numbers , and Futterman felt that Monteith 's vocals were a " perfect fit " for the song , appreciating the initially odd choreography for making the performance more interesting . Reiter was frustrated by the costuming , writing that the zombie makeup made the choreography difficult to follow . 
 Brissey 's lowest grade , a " B − " , went to " Bills , Bills , Bills " . Though she enjoyed the a cappella cover , Brissey found it incongruous in context , opining that Glee 's best performances are those linked to the storylines , allowing viewers to invest in their message . Several critics voiced similar complaints while enjoying the song itself , including Mullins , Futterman and the Houston Chronicle 's Bobby Hankinson . Tucker felt that it had " more snap and vigour " than the final number , but also disapproved of its awkward inclusion , writing that it impacted negatively on the episode 's momentum . Fallon gave the track an entirely positive review , suggesting that it should have been the episode 's opening number and lauding it as " surprising , oozing with charm , and actually kind of joyous . " CNN 's Lisa Respers France embraced the " completely random and bizarre " song choice , writing that it reminded her of the first season , " when [ she ] never knew what to expect and [ ... ] was often happily surprised . " Reiter too reviewed it favorably , calling it the best performance of the show . She appreciated the focus on facial expressions during the performance , in contrast to the elaborate costuming which she felt distracted from other numbers . 
 Bianco preferred the intimacy of " Bills , Bills , Bills " to " Thriller / Heads Will Roll " , which both he and Hyman criticized for its overproduction and editing . While Bianco found the final number anonymous , Hyman and Futterman approved of the performance overall , particularly for the makeup and costuming . Flandez and Brissey compared it favorably to the Super Bowl XLV halftime performances , with Brissey stating that the mashup did Jackson justice and giving it her highest grade of the episode , an " A − " . Roberts wrote that the performance " lived up to the pre @-@ show hype " , but felt that the rest of the episode " paled in comparison " . VanDerWerff commented favorably , " For the few minutes that number was on the screen , Glee was nearly everything it could be , blending fun music with insane production values and characters coming to certain emotional realizations in the moment , heightened as it is by the music .

 = = Gameplay = = 
 Mega Man 2 is a platform and action game like its predecessor , Mega Man . The player controls Mega Man as he traverses eight stages to defeat the bosses , Dr. Wily 's Robot Masters : Metal Man , Air Man , Bubble Man , Quick Man , Crash Man , Flash Man , Heat Man , and Wood Man . Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and a stage related to their weapon 's power . For example , Air Man shoots small tornadoes and is fought in a sky @-@ themed level , while Wood Man can use a shield of leaves and is found in a forest @-@ themed stage . After defeating a boss , their signature weapon becomes available to the player . The Robot Masters have weaknesses to the weapons of certain other Robot Masters ; therefore , choosing the order in which the levels are played is a vital component of the gameplay . After completing certain stages , Mega Man receives a special item . These items create platforms that allow Mega Man to access areas that he otherwise could not . 
 After defeating the eight Robot Masters , the player proceeds to Dr. Wily 's fortress , which consists of six levels that are played linearly . As in the first title , the player is required to fight each Robot Master a second time in Dr. Wily 's fortress . However , these battles take place in a single room rather than a series of linearly connected rooms . The room contains teleportation devices that lead to each Robot Master . The devices can be entered in any order , but are not labeled . Once the bosses are defeated again , the player must fight Dr. Wily . 
 Mega Man 2 features a few gameplay changes from the original Mega Man . A new item , the Energy Tank , allows a player to refill Mega Man ’ s health at any time . Also introduced is a password system . After defeating each Robot Master a password is displayed , allowing the player to return to that particular point in the game after restarting the system . The password stores the particular list of completed Robot Masters , as well as the number of accumulated Energy Tanks . Unlike the first game , Mega Man 2 does not feature a score counter , and the player is unable to return to Robot Master levels once completed . 
 = = Development = = 
 Mega Man 2 was developed and published by Capcom . In retrospect , series producer Keiji Inafune , who was credited as Inafking , described the game 's development as a " rogue effort " . The first Mega Man game — released in 1987 — was not successful enough to justify the immediate development of a sequel . Capcom allowed the development team to create a sequel on the condition that they work concurrently on other projects as well . The staff spent their own time on the project to improve upon the original by adding more levels and weapons , as well as improving the graphics . The project supervisor of the first Mega Man invited Inafune to the sequel 's development crew ; Inafune was working on a separate game at the time . In the previous title , Inafune worked as an artist and character designer , but became more involved in the production process of the sequel . " Working on [ Mega Man 2 ] marked my second year at this , and I even got to mentor a ' new kid ' , which opened up a whole new world of stress for me , " Inafune recounted . The development time for the game was only three to four months . 
 Due to the limited amount of cartridge space available for the first game , content was omitted from the final product . The unused elements were later transferred to Mega Man 2 . The team was limited by the graphical capabilities of the console , and designed characters as pixel art to maintain consistency between the designs and final product ; some design elements , however , were lost in the transition . The gameplay system from the original game was kept for Mega Man 2 , but the team included more traps for the player to navigate . The game 's three support items were added to aid the player because of complaints from consumers and Capcom 's marketing department regarding the original game 's high difficulty . Inafune 's supervisor was " especially unsure " about the usefulness of the Energy Tanks . The developers allowed input from the public by including boss designs created by fans . Capcom received 8 @,@ 370 boss submissions for the game , although even the designs for the final eight Robot Masters were " tweaked " . Inafune intended his artwork for Mega Man 2 to be more " anime @-@ ish " than in the first game . A second difficulty setting was added for the North American release . The original version was labeled " difficult " , and a " normal " setting was created that made the " arm cannon " and boss weapons more powerful . 
 The soundtrack for Mega Man 2 was composed by Takashi <unk> ( credited as <unk> Kun ) , with Mega Man composer Manami Matsumae ( credited as Manami <unk> ) co @-@ composing a minor part of the melody for Air Man 's stage . As with the previous game , the sound programming was handled by Yoshihiro Sakaguchi , credited as <unk> 's Papa . 
 Veteran video game cover illustrator Marc <unk> painted the North American box art , which included Mega Man firing a pistol instead of his trademark Mega Buster . <unk> explained , " I didn 't know anything about Mega Man , and [ after looking at the character in action ] I said to the art director , ' What is he shooting with ? ' ... He said , ' Well , he must have a pistol , because I don 't see a rifle . ' ... I said , ' So , a pistol ? Do you want me to do a pistol ? ' And he said , ' Yeah , let 's put a pistol in there . ' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there . Add to the fact that they only had , like , a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result . But certainly a result that was not my fault . I mean , they told me to put the pistol in his hand ! "

 Keiji Inafune claims the success of Mega Man 2 is what made the Mega Man series a hit that continues to spawn sequels . 1UP.com commented that the game helped establish the series as a prominent and commercially successful video game franchise . IGN cited Mega Man 2 as a title that helped define the action @-@ platforming genre . Retro Gamer credited it with helping the series obtain the global presence that allowed spin @-@ offs and more sequels to be created . Many of the conventions of the original Mega Man series were defined by the first title , but Mega Man 2 added conventions that were retained . The traditional number of Robot Masters for the series is eight as used in Mega Man 2 , rather than the six used in the original . It was the first in the series to include an opening cinematic . Mega Man 2 also introduced the Energy Tank item , special movement items , teleporter room , and password system , which became staples in future titles . The Energy Tank became the series ' iconic health refill item and later served as inspiration for a promotional " Rockman E @-@ Can " drink . In developing Mega Man 9 , producer Inafune and Hironobu Takeshita looked to the first two games in the series for inspiration , with Mega Man 2 serving as a standard to surpass in order to meet fans ' expectations .

However , Capcom has officially announced the game 's cancellation due to " various circumstances . " In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U , Wily Castle , as depicted in Mega Man 2 , appears as a selectable stage in both versions of the game .

 In 1990 , Tiger Electronics produced a handheld electronic version with abridged gameplay . Mega Man 2 was remade in 1994 for the Sega Genesis game Mega Man : The Wily Wars , featuring updated graphics and sound . In 1999 , Mega Man 2 was rereleased for the PlayStation as the second of six Rockman Complete Works discs , though only in Japan and under the original title Rockman 2 . It is largely identical to the original NES release , but had a number of bonuses , such as a " navi mode " for beginners that presents the player with a slightly re @-@ made version of the game , detailed encyclopedic content , image galleries , and remixed music . Mega Man 2 was included with nine other games in the series in Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the PlayStation 2 , GameCube , and Xbox , released between 2004 and 2005 . The game 's emulation is identical to the rerelease contained in Rockman Complete Works . Also in 2005 , Mega Man 2 was released alongside other Capcom games as part of a " Plug It In & Play TV Games " peripheral by Jakks Pacific . Mega Man 2 made its way to mobile phones in 2007 . The game was added as a part of the Wii Virtual Console service in PAL regions on December 14 , 2007 . In celebration of the ninth title 's release in September 2008 , Capcom Japan released the game in Japan on August 26 , 2008 and a North American release on September 15 , 2008 . In March 2009 , Capcom released the game for iOS , while in September of the same year the Complete Works version of Mega Man 2 was released on the Japanese PlayStation Store , making it available for download on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable . Inafune expressed a desire to remake Mega Man 2 , similar to Mega Man Powered Up , but stated that such a project was dependent on the commercial success of the latter . A tech demo for the Nintendo 3DS called Classic Games was shown at E3 2010 , displaying more than a dozen classic games , including Mega Man 2 , using 3D effects . Reggie Fils @-@ Aime announced that the titles were slated for release on the 3DS and would possibly use the 3DS ' features , such as 3D effects , analog control , or camera support . The game was released on the 3DS via the Virtual Console in Japan on August 8 , 2012 and was released in Europe and North America on February 7 , 2013 . 
 Mega Man 2 was novelized in the Worlds of Power series published by Scholastic in 1990 . The novel mostly follows the game , even offering game hints at the end of some chapters . Besides the added dialogue , the one major variation in the novel is that Dr. Light fears Mega Man 's chances against Dr. Wily 's more powerful new robots and while attempting to duplicate him , accidentally turns him into a human being , a difficulty Mega Man must endure throughout the story . The book 's cover also lacks the gun depicted on the North American boxart of the game , due to a " no weapons " policy that Worlds of Power writers had to abide by . 
 The game was also adapted into the third story arc for the Archie Comics Mega Man comic , " The Return of Dr. Wily . " In the arc , the Robot Masters are intended to either defeat Mega Man or infect him with a virus bit by bit as he absorbs their Special Weapons . All the Robot Masters are defeated but Mega Man ends up under Dr. Wily 's control , until the Mega Man Powered Up Robot Masters come to his rescue . Dr. Wily manages to escape and sets his course for the <unk> Ruins in South America , foreshadowing an adaptation of Super Adventure Rockman .

 The club was founded in 1946 and played in a variety of local leagues , including the Staffordshire County League , Manchester League , Mid @-@ Cheshire League and Cheshire County League , before becoming founder members of the North West Counties League in 1982 and from there progressing to the Northern Premier League in 1987 . In 1997 they were Northern Premier League champions and gained promotion to the Football Conference , the highest level of English non @-@ league football , spending two seasons at that level before being relegated . 
 Leek Town reached the final of the FA Trophy in 1990 , having progressed all the way from the first qualifying round , but lost in the final at Wembley Stadium . 
 = = History = = 
 Football was played in Leek from at least 1876 , with an earlier side called simply Leek F.C. having been part of The Combination in the 1890s , but the current Leek Town club traces its lineage to the formation of a team called Leek Lowe Hamil in 1946 ( although the club 's official history does not mention it , some sources state that the club was initially known as Abbey Green Rovers before adopting the Lowe Hamil name ) . 
 The club began life playing in the local Leek and Moorlands League , playing on a field adjoining a pub , before joining the Staffordshire County League in 1947 . In 1949 – 50 Lowe Hamil were champions of this league , becoming the first ( and to date only ) team to win the title without losing a single match ( some sources state this title win occurred in 1950 – 51 ) . In 1951 the team switched to the Manchester League , adopting the name Leek Town at the same time , and won the championship at the first attempt , after which the team relocated once more to the Mid @-@ Cheshire League , where again they played for just one season . In 1954 the team joined the Birmingham & District League but resigned in the middle of the 1956 – 57 season due to financial difficulties , after which they had another brief spell in the Manchester League , which was also curtailed due to monetary problems , before eventually returning to the Staffordshire County League . 
 In 1968 a new committee was formed , under which the club emerged from the doldrums . Manager Paul Ogden took over in 1969 and led the club to two Staffordshire County League championships , followed in quick succession by two Manchester League titles . After the second Manchester League win , Leek joined the Cheshire County League , where they were league champions at the second attempt in the 1974 – 75 season , but after Ogden left in 1975 to take over as manager of Northwich Victoria a series of managers came and went in quick succession without being able to maintain this level of success . 
 In 1982 the Cheshire County League merged with the Lancashire Combination to form the new North West Counties League , where Leek spent five relatively unsuccessful seasons . During their spell in this league former England player Mike Pejic took over as manager , Leek 's most high @-@ profile appointment to date , but he had only a short reign before moving to Northwich Victoria . Following Kevin Lewis ' brief reign Neil Baker took over in 1986 and was to lead the club to some of its greatest successes to date . 
 Leek were chosen to be among the founder members of the new Northern Premier League Division One in 1987 and in 1989 – 90 won the Division One title to gain promotion to the Premier Division , the highest level at which they had ever played . In the same season they progressed through eight rounds of the FA Trophy , including a quarter @-@ final win over Darlington , that season 's Conference champions , to reach the final at Wembley Stadium but were defeated 3 – 0 by Barrow . 
 In 1993 – 94 Leek finished second in the Northern Premier League Premier Division , which should have been sufficient for promotion to the Football Conference . However , they were refused promotion due to financial irregularities . To compound their problems , they were shifted from the Northern Premier League to the Southern League ; the resulting travel costs nearly crippled the club . After one season the club was allowed to return to the Northern Premier League . 
 In 1996 – 97 Leek claimed the Northern Premier League title by ten points and were this time granted promotion to the Conference . In their first season at this level they narrowly managed to avoid relegation but could not repeat the feat the following year and were relegated back to the Northern Premier League Premier Division . In 2000 – 01 the Blues were relegated to Division One , but regained their place in the Premier Division when the league was restructured due to the formation of Conference North in 2004 . The club achieved several mid @-@ table finishes in the league but struggled off the pitch . On 21 June 2006 it was announced that the club was in such severe financial peril that it was facing a winding @-@ up order , but on 11 June the following year it was confirmed that a new consortium had taken over the club and secured its future . In the 2007 – 08 season Leek finished in the bottom four , resulting in relegation to Division One South . Four seasons later the club qualified for the play @-@ offs for promotion back to the Premier Division , but lost in the final to Ilkeston . 
 = = Colours and crest = = 
 Leek 's home colours have traditionally been all blue , and their away colours all yellow , both colours which reflect the town 's coat of arms , which is predominantly blue and gold . The club has also used a blue and white kit similar to that of Blackburn Rovers , and a red and black away kit . Since 1997 , the team 's shirts have been sponsored by butter manufacturer <unk> , whose headquarters are in the town . 
 The club 's crest features a garb and a Staffordshire knot , both of which are elements of the town 's arms , as well as a caduceus , a symbol which appears on token coins issued in Leek in the 18th century . 
 = = Stadium = = 
 Harrison Park lies on the outskirts of Leek and has been the team 's home since 1948 , when the club purchased what was then called Hamil Park for the sum of £ 1 @,@ 250 . Changing rooms were constructed in the 1950s ( previously the players had been obliged to change in a nearby pub ) , along with the first covered accommodation for spectators , and floodlights ( which had previously belonged to the defunct Rugby Town ) were erected in 1972 , soon after which the stadium was renamed Harrison Park after former club chairman Geoff Harrison . 
 The ground currently has a seated stand along one side of the pitch , which was constructed in 1992 , three covered terraces and a small amount of uncovered terracing . In 1998 the ground was flooded when a nearby reservoir overflowed and the river which runs alongside the ground burst its banks . 
 Leek County School Old Boys , when they were in the North West Counties Football League , shared the ground between the early 1990s and 2014 .

 In the 2008 – 09 season Leek 's average attendance was 241 , placing them fourth out of twenty teams in the Northern Premier League Division One South , down 20 % compared to the previous season , when the team played in the Premier Division . In Leek 's final season in the Conference National , 1998 – 99 , the club 's average home attendance was 607 .

 Leek 's best ever league finish was a 19th @-@ place finish in Conference National ( level 5 of the overall English football league system ) in 1997 – 98 , the first of two seasons the team played at that level . The Blues have only twice progressed as far as the rounds proper of the FA Cup , reaching the first round in 1993 – 94 and the second round in 1990 – 91 , when they held Chester City to a draw at home but lost 4 – 0 in the replay . 
 Leek reached the final of the FA Trophy in 1989 – 90 but lost 3 – 0 to Barrow at Wembley Stadium . 
 The highest attendance figure recorded at Harrison Park came when the club played near @-@ neighbours Macclesfield Town in an FA Cup 2nd qualifying round match in the 1973 – 74 season in front of a crowd of 3 @,@ 512 .

 = East Midwood Jewish Center = 
 East Midwood Jewish Center is a Conservative synagogue located at 1625 Ocean Avenue , Midwood , Brooklyn , New York City . 
 Organized in 1924 , the congregation 's Renaissance revival building ( completed in 1929 ) typified the large multi @-@ purpose synagogue centers being built at the time , and was from the 1990s until 2010 the only synagogue with a working swimming pool in Brooklyn . The building has been unmodified architecturally since its construction , and in 2006 was added to the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) . 
 Membership dropped during the Great Depression , and the synagogue suffered financial hardship , but it recovered , and by 1941 had 1 @,@ 100 member families . In 1950 the congregation built an adjoining school ; at its peak its enrollment was almost 1 @,@ 000 . As neighborhood demographics changed in the late 20th century , and Brooklyn 's Jewish population became more Orthodox , the East Midwood Jewish Center absorbed three other Conservative Brooklyn congregations . 
 The East Midwood Jewish Center has had only four rabbis since it was founded . Reuben Kaufman served from 1924 to 1929 , Harry Halpern from 1929 to 1977 and Alvin Kass from 1976 to 2014 . In 2014 , Matt Carl became the rabbi .

 = = = Founding = = = 
 East Midwood was organized in 1924 by Jacob R. Schwartz , a dentist who was concerned that his two sons had no nearby Hebrew school which they could attend . From the start his intention had been to create a Conservative synagogue : Conservative Judaism was seen as a compromise between Orthodox and Reform , providing the familiar ( and lengthy ) Hebrew services of Orthodox Judaism , but , like Reform , adding some English prayers . East Midwood differed from earlier Ashkenazi synagogues in New York , as services were to be conducted in Hebrew and English only ( not Hebrew and Yiddish ) , and the members were to come from immigrants from all over Europe , not just one city or region . 
 East Midwood held its first annual meeting on November 18 , 1924 at the Jewish Communal Center of Flatbush ( also known as the Flatbush Jewish Center ) , and there elected its first president , Pincus Weinberg . Weinberg , who was also chair of the Real Estate Committee , was the father of Sidney Weinberg , who rose from the job of assistant porter to head Goldman Sachs from 1930 to 1969 . Prior to moving to Flatbush , Pincus Weinberg had been president of Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes . 
 East Midwood 's first rabbi was Reuben Kaufman , and its first cantor was Jacob <unk> . Kaufman , a Brooklyn native , had celebrated his Bar Mitzvah at Baith Israel Anshei Emes . 
 = = = Building construction = = = 
 The Real Estate Committee almost immediately purchased land located on Avenue L between East 26th and 27th Streets . Most members , however , felt a location on Ocean Avenue would be more desirable . Issues arose with developing the land on Avenue L , and in 1925 the Committee purchased the current location at 1625 Ocean Avenue in Midwood , Brooklyn . The cornerstone was laid in 1926 , and , although not complete , the building was fully enclosed by the autumn , and High Holiday services were held there that year . The Center 's Talmud Torah , which had been created in 1925 and held in a temporary structure , also moved into the new building . 
 Designed in the Renaissance revival style , the building was finally completed in 1929 at the cost of $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( today $ 13 @.@ 8 million ) . It typified the new " synagogue @-@ centers " being built at that time , combining the functions of both a synagogue and community center , and included " a synagogue , auditorium , kitchens , restaurant , classrooms , gymnasium , and swimming pool " . That year Kaufman left the Center to become the rabbi of Temple Emanu @-@ El in Paterson , New Jersey , and Harry Halpern became East Midwood 's rabbi . Halpern , who also became an adjunct professor of pastoral psychiatry at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America ( JTSA ) , would go on to serve as rabbi for 49 years , until his retirement in 1977 , four years before his death in 1981 . 
 = = = Great Depression and school building = = = 
 The Great Depression took its toll on the congregation , and membership dropped . In order to cope with the financial burdens , dues were raised , teachers were given endorsed notes rather than paychecks , the Executive Secretary was laid off , pews were sold , and individual members provided mortgage guarantees . The synagogue survived , and membership recovered ; by 1934 there were 300 members , and by 1944 there were 1 @,@ 100 . 
 In 1950 , East Midwood built a three story school building and a two @-@ story bridge link between the school and synagogue . At its peak in the early 1950s the school had an enrollment of almost 1 @,@ 000 . 
 East Midwood later created a Conservative Jewish day school , serving students from kindergarten to Grade 8 , and also providing " afternoon religious instruction for public school students through high school . " The school was subsequently renamed the Rabbi Harry Halpern Day School , in honor of Rabbi Halpern . 
 In October 1968 , then Mayor of New York City John Lindsay was booed and jeered by a huge crowd at the East Midwood Jewish Center , in an infamous incident during the 1968 New York City teachers strike . Lindsay had supported a school decentralization plan that had pitted mostly black parents against mostly Jewish teachers and school administration ; after the administrator of the Ocean Hill — Brownsville school board dismissed 13 teachers and 6 administrators ( mostly Jewish ) for opposing decentralization , the United Federation of Teachers " called a strike that closed 85 percent of the city 's 900 schools for 55 days " . 
 When Lindsay arrived he was met by a mob of 2 @,@ 000 people outside the synagogue , who shouted " Lindsay must go " and " we want Shanker " . Halpern admonished the protesters , asking " Is this the exemplification of the Jewish faith ? " , but many replied " yes " . Lindsay was heckled off the podium by the audience inside , and his limousine was " pounded on " and " pelted with trash " by the mob outside ( which had grown to 5 @,@ 000 ) as he drove away . The strike , which was marked by " threats of violence and diatribes laced with racism and anti @-@ Semitism " , ended when the New York legislature suspended the administrator and the board . 
 Following Halpern 's retirement in 1977 , East Midwood hired as rabbi Alvin Kass , a graduate of Columbia College and the JTSA , with a Ph.D. in philosophy from New York University .

 As Brooklyn 's changing demographics have made non @-@ Orthodox institutions less viable , East Midwood has absorbed three other congregations , including the Jewish Communal Center of Flatbush , where East Midwood had held its first annual meeting , and , in 1978 , Flatbush 's Congregation Shaare Torah . In 1996 , membership was 1 @,@ 000 families . 
 The synagogue building has remained architecturally unchanged since its construction , and was from the 1990s until 2010 the only synagogue in Brooklyn with a functioning swimming pool . In June 2006 , it was added to the NRHP . That year the congregation received a $ 300 @,@ 000 loan from the New York Landmarks Conservancy for repairs for " masonry and steel repairs on the side and rear facades . " It also raised $ 40 @,@ 000 in order to receive a 2 : 1 " matching grant " of $ 20 @,@ 000 from the Conservancy , and completed the repair work in 2007 . In November 2007 East Midwood was awarded a $ 409 @,@ 575 New York State Environmental Protection Fund grant to " restore features of the sanctuary including stained glass windows , stained glass dome and skylight . " 
 Aaron Pomerantz joined as associate rabbi in 1978 . Born in Poland , he had escaped Europe after the outbreak of World War II , moving to Canada and then the United States . There he graduated from Manhattan 's Washington Irving High School , and in 1952 received his rabbinic ordination from Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin . From 1948 he had served as ritual director and then rabbi of Congregation Shaare Torah , joining the East Midwood Jewish Center when the two congregations merged . He served until his death in May 2009 . 
 Dr. Alvin Kass served as Rabbi from 1976 @-@ 2014 . Kass has also been a New York City Police Department chaplain for over 40 years , and had previously served as a United States Air Force chaplain for two years . At one point during his service as Police Department chaplain he and his family received months of 24 @-@ hour security after death threats , and at another he defused a hostage situation by providing the hostage taker with sandwiches from the Carnegie Deli . Kass , who teaches ethics at the Police Academy , was instrumental in getting Jewish police officers time off to observe the Sabbath . He also convinced the NYPD <unk> Society ( the fraternal organization of Jewish members of the New York City Police Department ) to admit David Durk . Durk , along with the more famous Frank Serpico , had been the source of the allegations of police corruption that led to the formation of the Knapp Commission . In 2014 , Rabbi Kass retired from the position of Rabbi at East Midwood Jewish Center and currently serves as Rabbi Emeritus . 
 As of 2014 , Rabbi Matt Carl and Cantor Samuel Levine serve as the clergy of East Midwood Jewish Center . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The East Midwood Jewish Center building 's architect is uncertain . The design is officially credited to the Building Committee and Irving Warshaw , the construction superintendent . The architect 's name is not recorded in synagogue records , nor on the building 's dedicatory plaque . The Center 's National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) nomination form , however , argues that the architect was Louis Abramson , based on visual evidence and one piece of written evidence . 
 Abramson was a leading architect of synagogue @-@ centers at that time . He designed a number of New York examples , including the original synagogue @-@ center , the Manhattan Jewish Center ( 1918 ) , as well as the Brooklyn Jewish Center , the Flatbush Jewish Center , and the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center ( all constructed in Brooklyn between 1920 and 1924 ) . While the Flatbush Jewish Center has been completely remodeled , the Brooklyn and Ocean Parkway Jewish Centers are visually similar to the East Midwood Jewish Center , and the Brooklyn Jewish Center in particular has an identical layout . The written evidence consists of an entry in a souvenir journal commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Flatbush Jewish Center , stating that Abramson drew East Midwood 's plans . The NRHP nomination form speculates that Abramson drew the basic plans for the East Midwood Center , and that the Building Committee completed them , in order to save money . 
 Alternatively , Maurice Courland 's 1957 obituary claims the East Midwood Jewish Center as his work . Courland also designed a number of synagogues and New York landmarks , including Brooklyn 's Magen David Synagogue .
