 Following a string of successful adventure games , LucasArts assigned Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer to lead development of a new game . The two had previously assisted Ron Gilbert with the creation of The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2 : LeChuck 's Revenge , and the studio felt that Grossman and Schafer were ready to manage a project . The company believed that the pair 's humor matched well with that of Maniac Mansion and suggested working on a sequel . The two developers agreed and commenced production . Gilbert and Gary Winnick , the creators of Maniac Mansion , collaborated with Grossman and Schafer on the initial planning and writing . The total budget for the game was about $ 600 @,@ 000 , according to Schafer .

 In planning the plot , the four designers considered a number of concepts , eventually choosing an idea of Gilbert 's about time travel that they believed was the most interesting . The four discussed what time periods to focus on , settling on the Revolutionary War and the future . The Revolutionary War offered opportunities to craft many puzzles around that period , such as changing the Constitution to affect the future . Grossman noted the appeal of the need to make wide @-@ sweeping changes such as the Constitution just to achieve a small personal goal , believing this captured the essence of adventure games . The future period which allowed them to explore the nature of cause and effect without any historical bounds . Grossman and Schafer decided to carry over previous characters that they felt were the most entertaining . The two considered the Edison family " essential " and chose Bernard because of his " unqualified nerdiness " . Bernard was considered " everyone 's favorite character " from Maniac Mansion , and was the clear first choice for the protagonists . The game 's other protagonists , Laverne and Hoagie , were based on a Mexican ex @-@ girlfriend of Grossman 's and a Megadeth roadie named Tony that Schafer had met , respectively . Schafer and Grossman planned to use a character selection system similar to the first game , but felt that it would have complicated the design process and increased production costs . Believing that it added little to the gameplay , they removed it early in the process and reduced the number of player characters from six to three . The dropped characters included Razor , a female musician from the previous game ; <unk> , a short character in baggy clothes ; and Chester , a black beat poet . Ideas for Chester , however , morphed into new twin characters in the Edison family . The smaller number of characters reduced the strain on the game 's engine in terms of scripting and animation . 
 The staff collaboratively designed the characters . They first discussed the character personalities , which Larry Ahern used to create concept art . Ahern wanted to make sure that the art style was consistent and the character designs were established early , in contrast to what had happened with Monkey Island 2 , in which various artists came in later to help fill in necessary art assets as necessary , creating a disjointed <unk> Tunes animation shorts , particularly the Chuck Jones @-@ directed Rabbit of Seville , What 's Opera , Doc ? and Duck Dodgers in the 24 ½ th Century inspired the artistic design . The cartoonish style also lent itself to providing larger visible faces to enable more expressive characters . Peter Chan designed backgrounds , spending around two days to progress from concept sketch to final art for each background . Chan too used Looney Tunes as influence for the backgrounds , trying to emulate the style of Jones and Maurice Noble . Ahern and Chan went back and forth with character and background art to make sure both styles worked together without too much distraction . They further had Jones visit their studio during development to provide input into their developing art . The choice of art style inspired further ideas from the designers . Grossman cited cartoons featuring Pepé Le Pew , and commented that the gag involving a painted white stripe on Penelope Pussycat inspired a puzzle in the game . The artists spent a year creating the in @-@ game animations . 
 The script was written in the evening , when fewer people were in the office . Grossman considered it the easiest aspect of production , but encountered difficulties when writing with others around . 
 Grossman and Schafer brainstormed regularly to devise the time travel puzzles , and collaborated with members of the development team as well as other LucasArts employees . They would identify puzzle problems and work towards a solution similar to how the game plays . Most issues were addressed prior to programming , but some details were left unfinished to work on later . The staff conceived puzzles involving the U.S. ' s early history based on their memory of their compulsory education , and using the more legendary aspects of history , such as George Washington cutting down a cherry tree to appeal to international audiences . To complete the elements , Grossman researched the period to maintain historical accuracy , visiting libraries and contacting reference librarians . The studio , however , took creative license towards facts to fit them into the game 's design . 
 Day of the Tentacle features a four @-@ minute long animated opening credit sequence , the first LucasArts game to have such . Ahern noted that their previous games would run the credits over primarily still shots which would only last for a few minutes , but with Tentacle , the team had grown so large that they worried this approach would be boring to players . They assigned Kyle <unk> , an intern at CalArts , to create the animated sequence , with Chan helping to create minimalist backgrounds to aid in the animation . Originally this sequence was around seven minutes long , and included the three characters arriving at the mansion and releasing Purple Tentacle . Another LucasArts designer , Hal Barwood , suggested they cut it in half , leading to the shortened version as in the released game , and having the player take over when they arrive at the mansion .

 Day of the Tentacle uses the SCUMM engine developed for Maniac Mansion . LucasArts had gradually modified the engine since its creation . For example , the number of input verbs was reduced and items in the character 's inventory are represented by icons rather than text . While implementing an animation , the designers encountered a problem later discovered to be limitation of the engine . Upon learning of the limitation , Gilbert reminisced about the file size of the first game . The staff then resolved to include it in the sequel . 
 The title was the first LucasArts adventure game to incorporate voice work on release . The game was not originally planned to include voice work , as at the time , the install base for CD @-@ ROM was too low . As they neared the end of 1992 , CD @-@ ROM sales grew significantly . The general manager of LucasArts , Kelly Flock , recognizing that the game would not be done in time by the end of the year to make the holiday release , suggested that the team include voice work for the game , giving them more time to complete the title . 
 Voice director <unk> Barra managed that aspect of the game . Schafer and Grossman described how they imagined the characters ' voices and Barra sought audition tapes of voice actors to meet the criteria . She presented the best auditions to the pair . Schafer 's sister Ginny was among the auditions , and she was chosen for Nurse Edna . Schafer opted out of the decision for her selection to avoid nepotism . Grossman and Schafer encountered difficulty selecting a voice for Bernard . To aid the process , Grossman commented that the character should sound like Les <unk> from the television show <unk> in Cincinnati . Barra responded that she knew the agent of the character 's actor , Richard Sanders , and brought Sanders on the project . Denny Delk and Nick Jameson were among those hired , and provided voice work for around five characters each . Recording for the 4 @,@ 500 lines of dialog occurred at Studio 222 in Hollywood . Barra directed the voice actors separately from a sound production booth . She provided context for each line and described aspects of the game to aid the actors . The voice work in Day of the Tentacle was widely praised for its quality and professionalism in comparison to Sierra 's talkie games of the period which suffered from poor audio quality and limited voice acting ( some of which consisted of Sierra employees rather than professional talent ) . 
 The game 's music was composed by Peter McConnell , Michael Land and Clint Bajakian . The three had worked together to share the duties equally of composing the music for Monkey Island 2 and Fate of Atlantis , and continued this approach for Day of the Tentacle . According to McConnell , he had composed most of the music taking place in the game 's present , Land for the future , and Bajakian for the past , outside of Dr. Fred 's theme for the past which McConnell had done . The music was composed around the cartoonist nature of the game play , further drawing on Looney Tunes ' use of parodying classical works of music , and playing on set themes for all of the major characters in the game . Many of these themes had to be composed to take into account different processing speeds of computers at the time , managed by the iMUSE music interface ; such themes would include shorter repeating patterns that would play while the game 's screen scrolled across , and then once the screen was at the proper place , the music would continue on to a more dramatic phrase . 
 Day of the Tentacle was one of the first games concurrently released on CD @-@ ROM and floppy disk . A floppy disk version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase CD @-@ ROM drives . The CD @-@ ROM format afforded the addition of audible dialog . The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the floppy disk version . Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes and removing files such as the audio dialog to fit the game onto six diskettes .

 Day of the Tentacle was a moderate commercial success ; according to Schafer , it sold around 80 @,@ 000 copies upon release . The game was critically acclaimed . Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World wrote , " Calling Day of the Tentacle a sequel to Maniac Mansion [ ... ] is a little like calling the space shuttle a sequel to the slingshot " . He enjoyed the game 's humor and interface , and praised the designers for removing " dead end " scenarios and player character death . Ardai lauded the voice acting , writing that it " would have done the late Mel Blanc proud " , and compared the game 's humor , animation , and camera angles to " Looney Toons gems from the 40 's and 50 's " . He concluded , " I expect that this game will keep entertaining people for quite some time to come " . Sandy Petersen of Dragon stated that its graphics " are in a stupendous cartoony style " , while praising its humor and describing its sound and music as " excellent " . Although the reviewer considered it " one of the best " graphic adventure games , he noted that , like LucasArts ' earlier Loom , it was extremely short ; he wrote that he " felt cheated somehow when I finished the game " . He ended the review , " Go , Lucasfilm ! Do this again , but do make the next game longer ! " . 
 Phil LaRose of The Advocate called it " light @-@ years ahead of the original " , and believed that its " improved controls , sound and graphics are an evolutionary leap to a more enjoyable gaming experience " . He praised the interface , and summarized the game as " another of the excellent LucasArts programs that place a higher premium on the quality of entertainment and less on the technical knowledge needed to make it run " . The Boston Herald 's Geoff Smith noted that " the animation of the <unk> characters is of TV quality " , and praised the removal of dead ends and character death . He ended , " It 's full of lunacy , but for anyone who likes light @-@ hearted adventure games , it 's well worth trying " . Vox Day of The Blade called its visuals " well done " and compared them to those of The Ren & Stimpy Show . The writer praised the game 's humor , and stated that " both the music and sound effects are hilarious " ; he cited the voice performance of Richard Sanders as a high point . He summarized the game as " both a good adventure and a funny cartoon " . 
 Lim Choon Wee of the New Straits Times highly praised the game 's humor , which he called " brilliantly funny " . The writer commented that the game 's puzzles relied on " trial and error " with " no underlying logic " , but stated that the game " remains fun " despite this issue , and concluded that Day of the Tentacle was " definitely the comedy game of the year " . Daniel Baum of The Jerusalem Post called it " one of the funniest , most entertaining and best @-@ programmed computer games I have ever seen " , and lauded its animation . He wrote that the game provided " a more polished impression " than either The Secret of Monkey Island or Monkey Island 2 : LeChuck 's Revenge . The writer stated that its high system requirements were its only drawback , and believed that a Sound Blaster card was required to fully appreciate the game . In a retrospective review , Adventure Gamers ' Chris Remo wrote , " If someone were to ask for a few examples of games that exemplify the best of the graphic adventure genre , Day of the Tentacle would certainly be near the top " . 
 Day of the Tentacle has been featured regularly in lists of " top " games . In 1996 , Computer Gaming World ranked it as the 34th best game of all time , writing : " <unk> completely blew away its ancestor , Maniac Mansion , with its smooth animated sequences , nifty plot and great voiceovers . " Adventure Gamers included the game as the top entry on its 20 Greatest Adventure Games of All Time List in 2004 . The game has appeared on several IGN lists . The website rated it number 60 and 84 on its top 100 games list in 2005 and 2007 , respectively . IGN named Day of the Tentacle as part of their top 10 LucasArts adventure games in 2009 , and ranked the Purple Tentacle 82nd in a list of top 100 videogame villains in 2010 . ComputerAndVideoGames.com ranked it at number 30 in 2008 , and GameSpot also listed Day of the Tentacle as one of the greatest games of all time . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Fans of Day of the Tentacle created a webcomic , The Day After the Day of the Tentacle , using the game 's graphics . The 1993 LucasArts title Zombies Ate My Neighbors features a stage dedicated to Day of the Tentacle . The artists for Day of the Tentacle shared office space with the Zombies Ate My Neighbors development team . The team included the homage after frequently seeing artwork for Day of the Tentacle during the two games ' productions . In describing what he considered " the most rewarding moment " of his career , Grossman stated that the game 's writing and use of spoken and subtitled dialog assisted a learning @-@ disabled child in learning how to read . Telltale Games CEO Dan Connors commented in 2009 that an episodic game based on Day of the Tentacle would be " feasible " . However , he cautioned that such an endeavor would hinge on the sales of the Monkey Island titles released that year .

 According to Kotaku , a remastered version of Day of the Tentacle was in the works at LucasArts Singapore before the sale of LucasArts to Disney in 2012 . Though never officially approved , the game used a pseudo @-@ 3D art style and was nearly 80 % complete , according to one person close to the project , but was shelved in the days before the closure of LucasArts . 
 = = = Remastered = = = 
 At PlayStation Experience 2014 , Schafer announced that a remastered version of Day of the Tentacle , simply titled Day of the Tentacle Remastered , was being developed by his studio , Double Fine Productions . The remaster was released on March 22 , 2016 for PlayStation 4 , PlayStation Vita , Microsoft Windows and OS X , with a Linux version released at July 11th together with a mobile port for iOS . 
 Schafer credited both LucasArts and Disney for help in creating the remaster , which follows from a similar remastering of Grim Fandango , as well by Double Fine , in January 2015 . Schafer said when they originally were about to secure the rights to Grim Fandango from LucasArts to make the remaster , they did not originally have plans to redo the other LucasArts adventure games , but with the passionate response they got on the news of the Grim Fandango remaster , they decided to continue these efforts . Schafer described getting the rights to Day of the Tentacle a " miracle " though aided by the fact that many of the executives in the legal rights chain had fond memories of playing these games and helped to secure the rights . Schafer has expressed interest in continuing to restore these older titles , listing Full Throttle as his next goal , which is also confirmed to release in the future . 2 Player Productions , which has worked before with Double Fine to document their game development process , also created a mini @-@ documentary for Day of the Tentacle Remastered , which included a visit to the Skywalker Ranch , where LucasArts games were originally developed , where much of the original concept art and digital files for the game and other LucasArts adventure games were archived . 
 Day of the Tentacle Remastered retains its two @-@ dimensional cartoon @-@ style art , redrawn at higher resolution for modern computers . The high resolution character art was updated by a team led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan . Keim 's team used many of the original sketches of characters and assets from the two and emulated their style with improvements for modern graphics systems . Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in high resolution . As with the Grim Fandango remaster , the player can switch back and forth between the original graphics and the high @-@ resolution version . The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu , a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age , but the player can opt to switch back to the original interface . The game 's soundtrack has been redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system . There is an option to listen to commentary from the original creators , including Schafer , Grossman , Chan , McConnell , Ahern , and Bajakian . The remaster contains the fully playable version of the original Maniac Mansion , though no enhancements have been made to that game @-@ within @-@ a @-@ game . 
 Day of the Tentacle : Remastered has received positive reviews , with the PC version having an aggregate review score of 87 / 100 tallied by Metacritic . Reviewers generally praised the title as having not lost its charm since its initial release , but found some aspects of the remastering to be lackluster . Richard Corbett for Eurogamer found the game " every bit as well crafted now as it was in 1993 " , but found the processes used to provide high @-@ definition graphics from the original 16 @-@ bit graphics to making some of the required shortcuts taken in 1993 for graphics , such as background dithering and low animation framerates , more obvious on modern hardware . IGN 's Jared Petty also found the remastered to still be enjoyable , and found the improvement on the graphics to be " glorious " , but worried that the lack of a hint system , as was added in the The Secret of Monkey Island remastered version , would put off new players to the game . Bob Mackey for USgamer found that while past remastered adventure games have highlighted how much has changed in gamers ' expectations since the heyday of adventure games in the 1990s , Day of the Tentacle Remastered " rises above these issues to become absolutely timeless " . 
 = SL95 = 
 SL95 is a series of 32 low @-@ floor , articulated trams operated on the Oslo Tramway . The series is built by Ansaldo / Firema of Italy and delivered between 1999 and 2004 . Capacity for the eight @-@ axle , three @-@ section vehicles is 212 passengers , of which 88 can be seated . The name derives from being ordered in 1995 . Original plans called for the delivery to be between 1997 and 1998 . Delivery took many years due to a magnitude of technical flaws , including high noise levels , freezing during the winter and corrosion . The trams are 33 @.@ 12 metres ( 108 @.@ 7 ft ) long , 2 @.@ 6 metres ( 8 ft 6 in ) wide and 3 @.@ 62 metres ( 11 @.@ 9 ft ) tall . The aluminum vehicles weigh 64 @.@ 98 tonnes ( 63 @.@ 95 long tons ; 71 @.@ 63 short tons ) and have a power output of 840 kilowatts ( 1 @,@ 130 hp ) . 
 The trams operate all services on lines 13 , 17 and 18 . Due to their heavy weight and large turning radius they are unsuitable for the other lines . However , they are the only bi @-@ directional trams in the fleet , and are needed on lines 17 and 18 along the Ullevål Hageby Line . The trams cost about NOK 20 million each , but discounts were awarded after the delays and technical faults .

 In the early 1990s , Oslo Sporveier was in need of new trams to operate on their network . Except for 40 articulated SL79 @-@ trams that had been delivered between 1982 and 1990 , the company had several series of non @-@ articulated trams with trailers that were built before 1960 . The largest series were 13 <unk> , 11 rebuilt <unk> and 28 trailers , in addition to 34 <unk> that had been bought used from the Gothenburg Tramway in 1991 . Oslo Sporveier considered several possibilities for new trams , including ordering additional SL79s , purchasing motorized trailers for SL79 , purchasing new low @-@ floor trams , purchasing trams from ČKD Tatra , purchasing the 11 used TT Class 8 trams from Trondheim , rebuild the SL79s with an additional section or purchasing used articulated trams from abroad . Purchasing used material and rebuilding the SL79s was quickly rejected . An non @-@ articulated Tatra tram was tested in Oslo during January 1991 . 
 Oslo Sporveier had previously bought all their new trams custom @-@ made . For the 1995 order , the company instead wanted to purchase a pre @-@ designed tram . The company for a long time considered purchasing trams along with <unk> <unk> , who were needing new rolling stock for two light rail systems in Stockholm , Sweden . Three existing trams were tested in Oslo during 1995 , and several trams were also tested in Stockholm . 
 The first was a six @-@ axle articulated tram from Kassel , Germany , with 80 % low floor . The company disliked the lack of air suspension and a door construction where the doors went outwards . A <unk> built by ABB from the Chemnitz Stadtbahn was also tested . It has 100 % low @-@ floor , is 2 @.@ 65 metres ( 8 ft 8 in ) wide and also has outward @-@ opening doors . The width made it unsuitable for stopping at some of the new stops . Oslo Sporveier stated that although the tram had many nice features , it was too experimental for their liking . The final tested vehicle was a Class T tram from the Wien Tramway . The six @-@ axle vehicle was not well @-@ adapted for the Oslo system , since it was built after German light rail standards with high platforms and 25 metres ( 82 ft ) curve radius , and could not be operated on the Briskeby Line and the loop at Jar on the Lilleaker Line . 
 Following the tests in Oslo , a delegation was sent to look at compatible systems outside Oslo . After it had returned , the company went into negotiations with three manufacturers : Duewag , Bautzen and Ansaldo / Firema . Oslo Sporveier signed a contract with Ansaldo / Firema for delivery of 17 units in 1997 – 98 , with options for additional 15 units . The first 17 units cost NOK 335 million , or NOK 20 million per vehicle . The option rights were later exercised , and the total order was increased to 32 . This allowed Oslo Sporveier to replace all trams that were not articulated , and would give a maximum age in the tram fleet to 18 years . While Oslo Sporveier at first had planned to debt @-@ finance the purchase , by 1999 it was decided that the trams would be leased from <unk> <unk> <unk> . Due to a labor dispute about privatizing the operation of the tramway and the Oslo Metro , the ownership of all trams and metro trains , including the SL95 , were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007 .

 In January 1997 , two bogies were installed and tested on a <unk> @-@ tram trailer . On 10 February 1997 , a mock @-@ up of the driver 's cab was made in Italy and sent to Oslo to try to optimize the layout . On 8 April 1997 , Oslo Sporveier decided to order an additional 13 trams . The full options were not realized due to lack of funding . At the same time it was decided that all <unk> @-@ trams would be retired , while some <unk> @-@ trams would remain in service after the full delivery of the SL95s . By 1998 , delivery date for the first vehicle , no . 141 , was set to 23 May , with plans to put it into scheduled service on 23 June . The mock @-@ up was scrapped on 12 February . However , the tram was not completed until October , when representatives for the tram company could operate it for the first time at Firema 's plant . This delay was caused by the roof having blown off the plant . A NOK 1 million discount per tram was granted due to the incident . 
 Tram no . 141 arrived at Oslo on 5 January 1999 in three parts . They were connected together and tried within the end of the month on the entire network , prior to the delivery of tram 142 . Delivery frequency was set to every two weeks . During periods from April through June , the voltage along sections of the Lilleaker Line was raised from 600 to 750 V ; this included trials with the SL95 to ensure that it could operate under this current as well . 
 Tram 141 was first used in scheduled traffic on 30 May , when it was put into service on the newly extended Ullevål Hageby Line . This line had been extended 1 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) to Rikshospitalet , where it would serve the new national hospital . Unlike all the other lines of the tramway , this terminus does not have a turning loop , so only bidirectional trams can operate . SL95 was the only bidirectional tram in Oslo Sporveier 's fleet . Delays in the delivery caused the line to terminate at John Colletts plass , where there is a turning loop . 
 Tram 142 was first used in schedule service on 1 June 1999 , and 143 was delivered to Oslo on 3 June . To be able to use the trams on the desired lines , Oslo Sporveier had to upgrade its infrastructure several places . The SL95 need a vertical curve radius of 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) , requiring upgrades at Wessels plass and Gamlebyen . The curves would also need to be fixed at <unk> Bridge , but this was not done since the trams exceed the bridge 's permitted load . The minimum permitted horizontal curve radius is 17 metres ( 56 ft ) , making it impossible for the trams to operate through the intersection between <unk> gate and <unk> , where the radius is 16 @.@ 5 metres ( 54 ft ) . This means the trams cannot operate on the Briskeby Line , and all trams to Majorstuen are therefore operated with SL79 . Restrictions on two trams passing was issued on several shorter sections , including the S @-@ curve from Kirkeristen to Stortorvet , but these sections were quickly rebuilt . 
 By 2000 , deliveries were delayed , and in June all trams were taken out of service for three weeks to modify the gearboxes . In October , ten of thirteen trams were taken out of service due to radial run @-@ out . The problem was large enough that some trams got a new radial run @-@ out the day after they were fixed . From 6 January 2001 , SL95 could be used on the Grünerløkka – Torshov Line , and from 6 February , on the Ekeberg Line . However , the latter still had too short platforms . 
 Operation proved to give several major difficulties , and by March 2001 , Oslo Sporveier was threatening to terminate the purchase agreement unless the manufacturer — who by then had merged to become AnsaldoBreda — fixed the problems . These included the noise being 15 dB too loud , and trams being out of service during the January – February cold spell , when batteries and rectifiers would not operate . It was agreed that AnsaldoBreda would have to replace all 256 motors to satisfy the criteria in the contract . By 1 June , AnsaldoBreda had delivered one tram that met all the contract 's criteria . Tram 155 was by then still undelivered , and was being used for testing by the manufacturer . At the same time , 149 was being used for tests in Oslo . The trams were taken out of service , and gradually put back as they were upgraded . In February 2002 , tram 155 was equipped with new motors , and a new agreement was made where all motors would be replaced by December 2003 , if Oslo Sporveier was satisfied with six months of trials with 155 . 
 The last day with <unk> in service was on 1 November 2002 . By then , 27 of the SL95 @-@ trams had been delivered , and Oslo Sporveier was able to operate its entire network with only articulated trams . Until 2003 , trams 142 and 149 were not in service for long @-@ term repairs . On 8 July 2004 , a computer error caused tram 161 neither to be able to run nor open the doors , even with the emergency system . This was caused by the computer indicating that the tram was running at 12 @.@ 5 kilometres per hour ( 7 @.@ 8 mph ) while it stood still . All trams were later altered so the motorman could override such incidents . The final trams were delivered in 2004 , and no . 142 was put into service in January 2005 . At the same time , corrosion was discovered inside the articulation of tram 141 . In 2006 , Oslo Sporveier introduced a program to upgrade all the SL95 @-@ trams , including removing corrosion from the bodywork and the inside , as well as simplifying the lubrication of the joints , which prior to the upgrades required the entire trams to be de @-@ hooked . These upgrades are planned to be completed by 2009 . The trams have also had problems with the air supply freezing during cold spells , making it impossible to retract the side mirrors when changing direction , and terminating the secondary suspension . This requires the trams to be operated at walking speed without passengers .

 SL95 is a bidirectional , eight @-@ axle articulated tram built exclusively for the Oslo Tramway by Ansaldo of Italy . The tram has three sections , with one bogie on the first and last section and two bogies on the center section . The body is in aluminum , with sections that are welded along the floor and roof , and bolted on the side , to ease replacement of dented sections . The trams are 33 @.@ 12 meters ( 108 @.@ 7 ft ) long , 2 @.@ 6 meters ( 8 ft 6 in ) wide and 3 @.@ 62 meters ( 11 @.@ 9 ft ) tall . The axle distance in the bogies is 1 @.@ 80 meters ( 5 ft 11 in ) , and the distance between the bogie centers is 9 @.@ 85 meters ( 32 @.@ 3 ft ) from the center to the end , and 5 @.@ 17 meters ( 17 @.@ 0 ft ) between the two in the center . The tram weighs 64 @.@ 2 tonnes ( 63 @.@ 2 long tons ; 70 @.@ 8 short tons ) empty , and 78 @.@ 3 tonnes ( 77 @.@ 1 long tons ; 86 @.@ 3 short tons ) with payload . 
 Each of the four bogies have two three @-@ phase asynchronous motors on a steel bogie with two axles . The wheels have a 680 @-@ millimeter ( 27 in ) diameter when new and 610 @-@ millimeter ( 24 in ) when fully worn . The axles are rubber @-@ suspended against the bogies , while the bogies are air @-@ suspended against the chassis . The motors are type MTA @-@ F6 @-@ 105V built by Ansaldo , and the eight motors have a total power output of 840 kilowatts ( 1 @,@ 130 hp ) at 750 V. This allows a maximum speed of 80 kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) and an acceleration of 1 @.@ 5 meters per second squared ( 4 @.@ 9 ft / s2 ) . The vehicle can be reversed , but the speed is then automatically limited to 15 kilometres per hour ( 9 @.@ 3 mph ) . While the tram operated with 600 V , it had power output of 672 kilowatts ( 901 hp ) . 
 The vehicles have three braking systems : a primary regenerative dynamic brake , a secondary disc brake and an emergency rail brake . When braking with the regenerative brake , the energy can be fed back to the overhead wires . The trams are dimensioned to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes disconnected from one bogie , and for one hour if disconnected from two bogies , in which case only disc brakes will be used . 
 The trams are bidirectional , with a driver 's cab at each end . These cabs are built so the motorman can also sell tickets . The cab 's have a door to close them off , so the riders cannot access rear cab . There are four doors on both sides ; the front door is single while the three back doors are double . In addition to the front door , there is one door in each section . To operate the doors on the left side , the motorman must engage a security switch . It is also possible to open each individual door on the right side from the driver 's cab . Half the length is low @-@ floor , with an entry height at 350 millimetres ( 14 in ) , including three of the four doors . There are 88 seats , of which 64 are on the high @-@ floor section , giving a total capacity of 212 riders .

 The SL95s make up 32 of the 72 trams in the system , supplementing the older SL79 . The SL95s are the only bidirectional trams , and therefore the only ones that can operate on the Ullevål Hageby Line , that is served by lines 17 and 18 . Since line 13 is a continuation of line 17 at Sinsen , the SL95s also operate on that line . Due to a too @-@ small curve radius on the Briskeby Line , the SL95s do not operate on any of the lines to Majorstuen . They run on the Ullevål <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Grünerløkka – <unk> , <unk> and Skøyen lines . Each service has a ten @-@ minute headway , giving a five @-@ minute interval on section that are served by two lines . 
 In 2007 , two trams were involved in an accident and sent to Firema for reparations . However , the company filed for bankruptcy , and as of October 2010 the trams were still not repaired or returned to Oslo . In 2010 , Commissioner for Environmental Affairs and Transport <unk> <unk> ( Progress Party ) stated that the SL95 trams were being considered for replacement , at the same time as the much older SL79 . Problems with the units included excessive noise , excessive amount of time out of order , rust , cracks in the axles , and increased wear to the infrastructure because they weighed too much . All except two of the SL95 trams were temporarily grounded on 29 April 2013 when it was discovered that rust had damaged the joints between the articulated sections on several trams . 
 From 2012 , the trams were equipped with an automatic train protection system , which will allow them to run concurrently with the metro trains on the Kolsås Line . Oslo Vognselskap announced in September 2012 that they were preparing a tender to receive bids for new trams , which would replace all SL79 and SL95 units . In addition to procuring about seventy new units , Ruter initiated plans to upgrade the tramways for a combined NOK 4 billion . Oslo Vognselskap stated that the replacement trams would be about the same size as SL95 , but weigh only 40 tonnes ( 39 long tons ; 44 short tons ) , giving less wear on the tracks , and have a floor height of 30 centimeters ( 12 in ) . Replacements could start in 2016 and would be completed by 2019 . 
 = Brandenburg @-@ Prussia = 
 Brandenburg @-@ Prussia ( German : Brandenburg @-@ Preußen ) is the historiographic denomination for the Early Modern realm of the Brandenburgian Hohenzollerns between 1618 and 1701 . Based in the Electorate of Brandenburg , the main branch of the Hohenzollern intermarried with the branch ruling the Duchy of Prussia , and secured succession upon the latter 's extinction in the male line in 1618 . Another consequence of the intermarriage was the incorporation of the lower Rhenish principalities of Cleves , Mark and Ravensberg after the Treaty of Xanten in 1614 . The Thirty Years ' War ( 1618 – 48 ) was especially devastating . The Elector changed sides three times , and as a result Protestant and Catholic armies swept the land back and forth , killing , burning , seizing men and taking the food supplies . Upwards of half the population was killed or dislocated . Berlin and the other major cities were in ruins , and recovery took decades . 
 By the Peace of Westphalia , which ended the Thirty Years ' War in 1648 , Brandenburg gained Minden and Halberstadt , also the succession in Farther Pomerania ( incorporated in 1653 ) and the Duchy of Magdeburg ( incorporated in 1680 ) . With the Treaty of Bromberg ( 1657 ) , concluded during the Second Northern War , the electors were freed of Polish vassalage for the Duchy of Prussia and gained Lauenburg – Bütow and <unk> . The Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye ( 1679 ) expanded Brandenburgian Pomerania to the lower Oder . 
 The second half of the 17th century laid the basis for Prussia to become one of the great players in European politics later on . The emerging Brandenburg @-@ Prussian military potential , based on the introduction of a standing army in 1653 , was symbolized by the widely noted victories in Warsaw ( 1656 ) and Fehrbellin ( 1675 ) and by the Great Sleigh Drive ( 1678 ) . Brandenburg @-@ Prussia also established a navy and German colonies in the Brandenburger Gold Coast and Arguin . Frederick William , known as " The Great Elector " , opened Brandenburg @-@ Prussia to large @-@ scale immigration ( " <unk> " ) of mostly Protestant refugees from all across Europe ( " <unk> " ) , most notably Huguenot immigration following the Edict of Potsdam . Frederick William also started to centralize Brandenburg @-@ Prussia 's administration and reduce the influence of the estates . 
 In 1701 , Frederick III , Elector of Brandenburg , succeeded in elevating his status to King in Prussia . This was made possible by the Duchy of Prussia 's sovereign status outside the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , and approval by the Habsburg emperor and other European royals in the course of forming alliances for the War of the Spanish succession and the Great Northern War . From 1701 onward , the Hohenzollern domains were referred to as the Kingdom of Prussia , or simply Prussia . Legally , the personal union between Brandenburg and Prussia continued until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 . However , by this time the emperor 's overlordship over the empire had become a legal fiction . Hence , after 1701 , Brandenburg was de facto treated as part of the Prussian kingdom . Frederick and his successors continued to centralize and expand the state , transforming the personal union of politically diverse principalities typical for the Brandenburg @-@ Prussian era into a system of provinces subordinate to Berlin . 
 = = Establishment under John Sigismund ( 1618 ) = = 
 The Margraviate of Brandenburg had been the seat of the main branch of the Hohenzollerns , who were prince @-@ electors in the Holy Roman Empire , since 1415 . In 1525 , by the Treaty of Krakow , the Duchy of Prussia was created through partial secularization of the State of the Teutonic Order . It was a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland and was governed by Duke Albert of Prussia , a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern . On behalf of her mother Elisabeth of the Brandenburgian Hohenzollern , Anna Marie of Brunswick @-@ Lüneburg became Albert 's second wife in 1550 , and bore him his successor Albert Frederick . In 1563 , the Brandenburgian branch of the Hohenzollern was granted the right of succession by the Polish crown . Albert Frederick became duke of Prussia after Albert 's death in 1568 . His mother died in the same year , and thereafter he showed signs of mental disorder . Because of the duke 's illness , Prussia was governed by Albert 's nephew George Frederick of Hohenzollern @-@ Ansbach @-@ <unk> ( 1577 – 1603 ) . In 1573 , Albert Frederick married Marie Eleonore of Jülich @-@ Cleves @-@ Berg , with whom he had several daughters . 
 In 1594 , Albert Frederick 's then 14 @-@ year @-@ old daughter Anna married the son of Joachim Frederick of Hohenzollern @-@ Brandenburg , John Sigismund . The marriage ensured the right of succession in the Prussian duchy as well as in Cleves . Upon George Frederick 's death in 1603 , the regency of the Prussian duchy passed to Joachim Frederick . Also in 1603 , the Treaty of Gera was concluded by the members of the House of Hohenzollern , ruling that their territories were not to be internally divided in the future . 
 The Electors of Brandenburg inherited the Duchy of Prussia upon Albert Frederick 's death in 1618 , but the duchy continued to be held as a fief under the Polish Crown until 1656 / 7 . Since John Sigismund had suffered a stroke in 1616 and as a consequence was severely handicapped physically as well as mentally , his wife Anna ruled the Duchy of Prussia in his name until John Sigismund died of a second stroke in 1619 , aged 47 . 
 = = George William , 1619 – 1640 = = 
 From 1619 to 1640 , George William was elector of Brandenburg and duke of Prussia . He strove , but proved unable to break the dominance of the Electorate of Saxony in the Upper Saxon Circle . The Brandenburg @-@ Saxon antagonism rendered the defense of the circle ineffective , and it was subsequently overrun by Albrecht von Wallenstein during the Thirty Years ' War . While George William had claimed neutrality before , the presence of Wallenstein 's army forced him to join the Catholic @-@ Imperial camp in the Treaty of Königsberg ( 1627 ) and accept garrisons . When the Swedish Empire entered the war and advanced into Brandenburg , George William again claimed neutrality , yet Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden compelled George William to join Sweden as an ally by occupying substantial territory in Brandenburg @-@ Prussia and concentrating an army before the town walls of Berlin . George William did not conclude an alliance , but granted Sweden transit rights , two fortresses and subsidies . Consequently , Roman Catholic armies repeatedly ravaged Brandenburg and other Hohenzollern lands . 
 = = " The Great Elector " , Frederick William , 1640 – 1688 = = 
 During the Thirty Years ' War , George William was succeeded by Frederick William , born 1620 , who became known as " The Great Elector " ( Der Große Kurfürst ) . The character of the young elector had been stamped by his Calvinist <unk> <unk> , a long stay in the Dutch Republic during his grand tour , and the events of the war , of which a meeting with his uncle Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in Pomerania was among the most impressive . 
 = = = Conclusion of the Thirty Years ' War = = = 
 Frederick William took over Brandenburg @-@ Prussia in times of a political , economical and demographic crisis caused by the war . Upon his succession , the new elector retired the Brandenburgian army , but had an army raised again in 1643 / 44 . Whether or not Frederick William concluded a truce and neutrality agreement with Sweden is disputed : while a relevant 1641 document exists , it was never ratified and has repeatedly been described as a <unk> established the growth of Brandenburg @-@ Prussia . 
 At the time , the forces of the Swedish Empire dominated Northern Germany , and along with her ally France , Sweden became guarantee power of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . The Swedish aim of controlling the Baltic Sea by establishing dominions on the coastline ( " dominium maris baltici " ) thwarted Frederick William 's ambitions to gain control over the Oder estuary with Stettin ( now Szczecin ) in Pomerania . 
 The Brandenburgian margraves had long sought to expand northwards , connecting land @-@ locked Brandenburg to the Baltic Sea . The Treaty of <unk> ( 1529 ) guaranteed Brandenburgian succession in the Duchy of Pomerania upon the extinction of the local House of Pomerania , and would have come into effect by the death of Pomeranian duke Bogislaw XIV in 1637 . By the Treaty of Stettin ( 1630 ) however , Bogislaw XIV had also effectively handed over control of the duchy to Sweden , who refused to give in to the Brandenburgian claim . The Peace of Westphalia settled for a partition of the duchy between Brandenburg and Sweden , who determined the exact border in the Treaty of Stettin ( 1653 ) . Sweden retained the western part including the lower Oder ( Swedish Pomerania ) , while Brandenburg gained the eastern part ( Farther Pomerania ) . Frederick William was dissatisfied by this outcome , and the acquisition of the whole Duchy of Pomerania was to become one of the main goals of his foreign policy . 
 In the Peace of Westphalia , Frederick William was compensated for Western Pomerania with the secularized bishoprics of Halberstadt and Minden and the right of succession to the likewise secularized Archbishopric of Magdeburg . With Halberstadt , Brandenburg @-@ Prussia also gained several smaller territories : the Lordship of <unk> , the County of Regenstein , the Lordship of <unk> and the Lordship of <unk> . This was primarily due to French efforts to counterbalance the power of the Habsburg emperor by strengthening the Hohenzollern , and while Frederick William valued these territories lower than Western Pomerania , they became step @-@ stones for the creation of a closed , dominant realm in Germany in the long run . 
 = = = Devastation = = = 
 Of all Brandenburg @-@ Prussian territories , the Electorate of Brandenburg was among the most devastated at the end of the Thirty Years ' War . Already before the war , the population density and wealth in the electorate had been low compared to other territories of the empire , and the war had destroyed 60 towns , 48 castles and about 5 @,@ 000 villages . An average of 50 % of the population was dead , in some regions only 10 % survived . The rural population , due to deaths and flight to the towns , had dropped from 300 @,@ 000 before the war to 75 @,@ 000 thereafter . In the important towns of Berlin @-@ Cölln and Frankfurt an der Oder , the population drop was one third and two third , respectively . Some of the territories gained after the war were likewise devastated : in Pomerania , only one third of the population survived , and Magdeburg , once among the wealthiest cities of the empire , was burned down with most of the population slain . Least hit were the Duchy of Prussia , which was only peripherally involved in the war , and Minden . 
 Despite efforts to resettle the devastated territories , it took some of them until the mid @-@ 18th century to reach the pre @-@ war population density . 
 = = = Cow War = = = 
 In June 1651 , Frederick William broke the provisions of the Peace of Westphalia by invading Jülich @-@ Berg , bordering his possessions in Cleves @-@ Mark at the lower Rhine river . The Treaty of Xanten , which had ended the War of the Jülich succession between Brandenburg and the count palatines in 1614 , had partitioned the once united Duchies of Jülich @-@ Cleves @-@ Berg among the belligerents , and Jülich @-@ Berg was since ruled by the Catholic counts of Palatinate @-@ Neuburg . After the Thirty Years ' War , Wolfgang William , Count Palatine of Neuburg , disregarded a 1647 agreement with Frederick William which had favored the Protestants in the duchies , while Frederick William insisted that the agreement be upheld . Besides these religious motives , Frederick William 's invasion also aimed at territorial expansion . 
 The conflict had the potential to spark another international war since Wolfgang William wanted to have the still not demobilized army of Lorraine , which continued to operate in the region despite the Peace of Westphalia , to intervene on his side , and Frederick William sought support of the Dutch Republic . The latter however followed a policy of neutrality and refused to aid Frederick William 's campaign , which was furthermore opposed by the Imperial estates as well as the local ones . Politically isolated , Frederick William aborted the campaign after the Treaty of Cleves negotiated by Imperial mediators in October 1651 . The underlying religious dispute was only solved in 1672 . While military confrontations were avoided and the Brandenburg @-@ Prussian army was primarily occupied with stealing cattle ( hence the name ) , it considerably lowered Frederick William 's reputation . 
 = = = Standing army = = = 
 Due to his wartime experiences , Frederick William was convinced that Brandenburg @-@ Prussia would only prevail with a standing army . Traditionally , raising and financing army reserves was a privilege of the estates , yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently of the estates . He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a <unk> decree of 26 July 1653 . In turn , he confirmed several privileges of the knights , including tax exemption , assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates ( <unk> ) and the upholding of serfdom ( <unk> , <unk> ) . 
 Initially , the estates ' contributions were limited to six years , yet the Frederick William obliged the estates to continue the payments thereafter and created a dedicated office to collect the contributions . The contributions were confirmed by the estates in 1662 , but transformed in 1666 by decree from a real estate tax to an excise tax . Since 1657 , the towns had to contribute not soldiers , but monetary payments to the army , and since 1665 , the estates were able to free themselves from contributing soldiers by additional payments . The initial army size of 8 @,@ 000 men had risen to 25 @,@ 000 to 30 @,@ 000 men by 1688 . By then , Frederick William had also accomplished his second goal , to finance the army independently of the estates . By 1688 , these military costs amounted to considerable 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 <unk> or half of the state budget . Ensuring a solid financial basis for the army , undisturbed by the estates , was the foremost objective of Frederick William 's administrative reforms . He regarded military success as the only way to gain international reputation . 
 = = = Second Northern War = = = 
 The Swedish invasion of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth in the following year started the Second Northern War . Frederick William offered protection to the Royal Prussian towns in the Treaty of <unk> , but had to yield Swedish military supremacy and withdraw to his Prussian duchy . Pursued by Swedish forces to the Prussian capital , Frederick William made peace and allied with Sweden , taking the Duchy of Prussia and Ermland ( <unk> , Warmia ) as fiefs from Charles X Gustav of Sweden in the Treaty of Königsberg in January 1656 . The alliance proved victorious in the Battle of Warsaw in June , enhancing the elector 's international reputation . Continued pressure on Charles X Gustav resulted in him conceding full sovereignty in Ducal Prussia and Ermland to Frederick William by the Treaty of <unk> in November to ensure the maintenance of the alliance . The Treaty of Radnot , concluded in December by Sweden and her allies , further awarded Greater Poland to Brandenburg @-@ Prussia in case of a victory . 
 When the anti @-@ Swedish coalition however gained the upper hand , Frederick William changed sides when Polish king John II Casimir Vasa confirmed his sovereignty in Prussia , but not in Ermland , in the Treaty of Wehlau @-@ Bromberg in 1657 . The duchy would legally revert to Poland if the Hohenzollern dynastic line became extinct . Hohenzollern sovereignty in the Prussian duchy was confirmed in the Peace of Oliva , which ended the war in 1660 . Brandenburg @-@ Prussian campaigns in Swedish Pomerania did not result in permanent gains . 
 = = = Dutch and Scanian Wars = = = 
 In 1672 , the Franco @-@ Dutch War broke out , with Brandenburg @-@ Prussia involved as an ally of the Dutch Republic . This alliance was based on a treaty of 1669 , and resulted in French occupation of Brandenburg @-@ Prussian Cleves . In June 1673 , Frederick William abandoned the Dutch alliance and concluded a subsidy treaty with France , who in return withdrew from Cleves . When the Holy Roman Empire declared war on France ( <unk> ) , Brandenburg @-@ Prussia again changed sides and joined the imperial forces . France pressured her ally Sweden to relieve her by attacking Brandenburg @-@ Prussia from the north . Charles XI of Sweden , dependent on French subsidies , reluctantly occupied the Brandenburgian Uckermark in 1674 , starting the German theater of the Scanian War ( Brandenburg @-@ Swedish War ) . Frederick William reacted promptly by marching his armies from the Rhine to northern Brandenburg , and encountered the rear of the Swedish army , which was in the process of crossing a swamp , in the Battle of Fehrbellin ( 1675 ) . Though a minor skirmish from a military perspective , Frederick William 's victory turned out to be of huge symbolic significance . The " Great Elector " started a counter @-@ offensive , pursuing the retreating Swedish forces through Swedish Pomerania . 
 Polish king John III Sobieski planned to restore Polish suzerainty over the Duchy of Prussia , and for this purpose concluded an alliance with France on 11 June 1675 . France promised assistance and subsidies , while Sobieski in turn allowed French recruitment in Poland @-@ Lithuania and promised to aid Hungarian rebel forces who were to distract the Habsburgs from their war against France . For this plan to work out , Poland @-@ Lithuania had to first conclude her war against the Ottoman Empire , which French diplomacy despite great efforts failed to achieve . Furthermore , Sobieski was opposed by the Papacy , by Polish gentry who saw the Ottomans as the greater threat , and by Polish magnates bribed by Berlin and Vienna . Inner @-@ Polish Catholic opposition to an intervention on the Protestant Hungarian rebels ' side added to the resentments . Thus , while Treaty of <unk> ended the Polish @-@ Ottoman war in 1676 , Sobieski sided with the emperor instead , and the plan for a Prussian campaign was dropped . 
 By 1678 , Frederick William had cleared Swedish Pomerania and occupied most of it , with the exception of Rügen which was held by Denmark – Norway . This was followed by another success against Sweden , when Frederick William cleared Prussia of Swedish forces in what became known as the Great Sleigh Drive . However , when Louis XIV of France concluded the Dutch War by the Nijmegen treaties , he marched his armies east to relieve his Swedish ally , and forced Frederick William to basically return to the status quo ante bellum by the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye ( 1679 ) . Though the Scanian War resulted only in minor territorial gains , attaching a small strip of the Swedish Pomeranian right bank of the lower Oder to Brandenburg @-@ Prussian Pomerania , the war resulted in a huge gain of prestige for the elector . 
 = = Frederick III ( I ) , 1688 – 1713 = = 
 Frederick III of Brandenburg , since 1701 also Frederick I of Prussia , was born in Königsberg in 1657 . Already in the last years of the reign of his father , the friendly relations with France established after Saint Germain ( 1679 ) had cooled down , not least because of the Huguenot question . In 1686 , Frederick William turned toward the Habsburg emperor , with whom he concluded an alliance on 22 December 1686 . For this alliance , Frederick William relinquished rights on Silesia in favor of the Habsburgs , and in turn received the Silesian County of <unk> which bordered the Neumark . Frederick III , present at the negotiations as crown prince , assured the Habsburgs of the continuation of the alliance once he was in power , and secretly concluded an amendment to return <unk> to the Habsburgs , which he eventually did in 1694 . Throughout his reign , Brandenburg @-@ Prussia remained a Habsburg ally and repeatedly deployed troops to fight against France . In 1693 , Frederick III began to sound out the possibility of an elevation of his status at the Habsburg court in Vienna , and while the first attempt was unsuccessful , elevation to a king remained the central goal on his agenda . 
 The envisioned status elevation did not merely serve a decorative purpose , but was regarded a necessity to prevail in political competition . Though Frederick III held the elevated status of a prince elector , this status was also gained by Maximilian I of Bavaria in 1623 , during the Thirty Years ' War , also by the Elector of the Palatinate in the Peace of Westphalia ( 1648 ) , and by Ernest Augustus of the House of Hanover in 1692 . Thus , the formerly exclusive club of the prince @-@ electors now had nine members , six of whom were secular princes , and further changes seemed possible . Within the circle of prince @-@ electors , August the Strong , Elector of Saxony , had secured the Polish crown in 1697 , and the House of Hanover had secured succession of the British throne . From Frederick III 's perspective , stagnation in status meant loss of power , and this perspective seemed to be confirmed when the European royals ignored Brandenburg @-@ Prussia 's claims in the Treaty of Rijswijk ( 1697 ) . 
 Frederick decided to raise the Duchy of Prussia to a kingdom . Within the Holy Roman Empire , no one could call himself king except the emperor and the king of Bohemia . However , Prussia was outside the empire , and the Hohenzollerns were fully sovereign over it . The practicability of this plan was doubted by some of his advisors , and in any case the crown was only valuable if recognized by the European nobility , most important the Holy Roman Emperor . In 1699 , negotiations were renewed with emperor Leopold I , who in turn was in need of allies since the War of the Spanish Succession was about to break out . On 16 November 1700 , the emperor approved Frederick 's coronation in the <unk> ( " Crown tract " ) . With respect to Poland @-@ Lithuania , who held the provinces of Royal Prussia and Ermland , it was agreed that Frederick would call himself King in Prussia , instead of King of Prussia . Great Britain and the Dutch Republic , for similar reasons as the emperor , accepted Frederick 's elevation prior to the coronation . 
 On 17 January 1701 , Frederick dedicated the royal coat of arms , the Prussian black eagle , and motto , " suum <unk> " . On 18 January , he crowned himself and his wife Sophie Charlotte in a baroque ceremony in Königsberg Castle . 
 On 28 January , August the Strong congratulated Frederick , yet not as Polish king , but as Saxon elector . In February , Denmark – Norway accepted Frederick 's elevation in hope of an ally in the Great Northern War , and the Tsardom of Russia likewise approved in 1701 . Most princes of the Holy Roman Empire followed . Charles XII of Sweden accepted Frederick as Prussian king in 1703 . In 1713 , France and Spain also accepted Frederick 's royal status . 
 The coronation was not accepted by the Teutonic Order , who despite the secularization of the Duchy of Prussia in 1525 upheld claims to the region . The Grand Master protested at the emperor 's court , and the pope sent a circular to all Catholic regents to not accept Frederick 's royal status . Until 1787 , papal documents continued to speak of the Prussian kings as " <unk> of Brandenburg " . Neither did the Polish – Lithuanian nobility accept Frederick 's royal status , seeing the Polish province of Royal Prussia endangered , and only in 1764 was the Prussian kingship accepted . 
 Since Brandenburg was still legally part of the Holy Roman Empire , the personal union between Brandenburg and Prussia technically continued until the empire 's dissolution in 1806 . However , the emperor 's power was only nominal by this time , and Brandenburg soon came to be treated as a de facto province of the Prussian kingdom . Although Frederick was still only an elector within the portions of his domain that were part of the empire , he only acknowledged the emperor 's overlordship over them in a formal way . 
 = = Administration = = 
 In the mid @-@ 16th century , the margraves of Brandenburg had become highly dependent on the estates ( counts , lords , knights and towns , no prelates due to the Protestant Reformation in 1538 ) . The <unk> 's liabilities and tax income as well as the margrave 's finances were controlled by the Kreditwerk , an institution not controlled by the elector , and the Großer <unk> ( " Great Committee " ) of the estates . This was due to concessions made by Joachim II in 1541 in turn for financial aid by the estates , however , the Kreditwerk went bankrupt between 1618 and 1625 . The margraves further had to yield the veto of the estates in all issues concerning the " better or worse of the country " , in all legal commitments , and in all issues concerning pawn or sale of the elector 's real property . 
 To reduce the influence of the estates , Joachim Frederick in 1604 created a council called Geheimer Rat für die <unk> ( " Privy Council for the Electorate " ) , which instead of the estates was to function as the supreme advisory council for the elector . While the council was permanently established in 1613 , it failed to gain any influence until 1651 due to the Thirty Years ' War . 
 Until after the Thirty Years ' War , the territories of Brandenburg @-@ Prussia were politically independent from each other , connected only by the common feudal superior . Frederick William , who envisioned the transformation of the personal union into a real union , started to centralize the Brandenburg @-@ Prussian government with an attempt to establish the Geheimer Rat as a central authority for all territories in 1651 , but this project proved to be unfeasible . Instead , the elector continued to appoint a governor ( <unk> Rat ) for each territory , who in most cases was a member of the Geheimer Rat . The most powerful institution in the territories remained the governments of the estates ( <unk> <unk> , named <unk> in Prussia and Geheime <unk> in Mark and Cleves ) , which were the highest government agencies regarding jurisdiction , finances and administration . The elector attempted to balance the estates ' governments by creating <unk> chambers to administer and coordinate the elector 's domains , tax income and privileges . Such chambers were introduced in Brandenburg in 1652 , in Cleves and Mark in 1653 , in Pomerania in 1654 , in Prussia in 1661 and in Magdeburg in 1680 . Also in 1680 , the Kreditwerk came under the aegis of the elector . 
 Frederick William 's excise tax ( Akzise ) , which since 1667 replaced the property tax raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg @-@ Prussia 's standing army with the estates ' consent , was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates . The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically , enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates . In the Duchy of Prussia , he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663 , but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges were not to be used to interfere with the exertion of the elector 's sovereignty . As in Brandenburg , Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector : while in 1656 , an Akzise was raised with the estates ' consent , the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates for the first time in 1674 . Since 1704 , the Prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector 's taxes while formally still entitled to do so . In 1682 , the elector introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg , while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720 . Due to Frederick William 's reforms , the state income increased threefold during his reign , and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France . 
 Under the rule of Frederick III ( I ) , the Brandenburg Prussian territories were de facto reduced to provinces of the monarchy . Frederick William 's testament would have divided Brandenburg @-@ Prussia among his sons , yet firstborn Frederick III with the emperor 's backing succeeded in becoming the sole ruler based on the Treaty of Gera , which forbade a division of Hohenzollern territories . In 1689 , a new central chamber for all Brandenburg @-@ Prussian territories was created , called Geheime <unk> ( since 1713 : <unk> ) . This chamber functioned as a superior agency of the territories ' <unk> chambers . The General War Commissariat ( <unk> ) emerged as a second central agency , superior to the local <unk> agencies initially concerned with the administration of the army , but until 1712 transformed into an agency also concerned with general tax and police tasks .

 In 1613 , John Sigismund converted from Lutheranism to Calvinism , but failed to achieve the conversion of the estates by the rule of cuius regio , eius religio . Thus , on 5 February 1615 , he granted the Lutherans religious freedom , while the electors court remained largely Calvinist .

 Brandenburg @-@ Prussia established a navy and colonies during the reign of Frederick William . The " Great Elector " had spent part of his childhood at the Pomeranian court and port cities of <unk> ( 1631 – 1633 ) and Stettin ( 1633 – 1635 ) , and afterwards studied at the Dutch universities of Leyden and The Hague ( 1635 – 1638 ) . When Frederick William became elector in 1640 , he invited Dutch engineers to Brandenburg , sent Brandenburgian engineers to study in the Netherlands , and in 1646 married educated Luise Henriette of the Dutch House of Orange @-@ Nassau . After the Thirty Years ' War , Frederick William tried to acquire finances to rebuild the country by participating in oversea trade , and attempted to found a Brandenburg @-@ Prussian East Indies Company . He engaged former Dutch admiral <unk> <unk> van Lier as advisor and tried to persuade the Holy Roman Emperor and princes of the empire to participate . The emperor , however , declined the request as he considered it dangerous to disturb the interest of the other European powers . In 1651 , Frederick William bought Danish Fort Dansborg and Tranquebar for 120 @,@ 000 <unk> . As Frederick William was unable to raise this sum , he asked several people and Hanseatic towns to invest in the project , but since none of these were able or willing to give sufficient money , the treaty with Denmark was nullified in 1653 . 
 = = = Navy = = = 
 In 1675 , after the victory at Fehrbellin and the Brandenburg @-@ Prussian advance in Swedish Pomerania during the Scanian War , Frederick William decided to establish a navy . He engaged Dutch merchant and shipowner Benjamin Raule as his advisor , who after a first personal meeting with Frederick William in 1675 settled in Brandenburg in 1676 and became the major figure of Brandenburg @-@ Prussia 's emerging naval and colonial enterprise . The Brandenburg @-@ Prussian navy was established from ten ships which Frederick William leased from Raule , and achieved first successes in the war against Sweden supporting the siege of Stralsund and Stettin and the invasion of Rügen . In Pillau ( now Baltiysk ) on the East Prussian coast , Raule established shipyards and enlarged the port facilities . 
 After the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye ( 1679 ) , the navy was used to hijack Swedish ships in the Baltic Sea , and in 1680 , six Brandenburg @-@ Prussian vessels captured the Spanish vessel Carolus Secundus near <unk> to pressure Spain to pay promised subsidies . The Spanish ship was renamed Markgraf von Brandenburg ( " Margrave of Brandenburg " ) and became the flagship of an Atlantic fleet that was ordered to capture Spanish vessels carrying silver ; it was not successful in this mission . In the following years , the navy was expanded , and the policy of leasing ships was replaced by the policy of building or purchasing them . On 1 October 1684 Frederick William bought all ships that had been leased for 110 @,@ 000 <unk> . Also in 1684 , the East Frisian port of Emden replaced Pillau as the main Brandenburg @-@ Prussian naval base . From Pillau , part of the shipyard , the admiral 's house and the wooden church of the employees was transferred to Emden . While Emden was not part of Brandenburg @-@ Prussia , the elector owned a nearby castle , <unk> , and negotiated an agreement with the town to maintain a garrison and a port .

 In 1679 , Raule presented Frederick William a plan to establish colonies in African Guinea , and the elector approved . In July 1680 , Frederick William issued respective orders , and two ships were selected to establish trade contacts with African tribes and explore places where colonies could be established . On 17 September , frigate Wappen von Brandenburg ( " Seal of Brandenburg " ) and Morian ( poetic for " Mohr " , " Negro " ) left for Guinea . The ships reached Guinea in January 1681 . Since the crew of the Wappen von Brandenburg sold a barrel of brandy to Africans in a territory claimed by the Dutch West Indies Company , the latter confiscated the ship in March . The crew of the remaining ship Morian managed to have three Guinean chieftains sign a contract on 16 May , before the Dutch expelled the vessel from the coastal waters . This treaty , officially declared as trade agreement , included a clause of subjection of the chiefs to Frederick William 's overlordship and an agreement allowing Brandenburg @-@ Prussia to establish a fort , and is thus regarded the beginning of the Brandenburg @-@ Prussian colonial era . 
 To facilitate the colonial expeditions , the Brandenburg African Company was founded on 7 March 1682 , initially with its headquarters in Berlin and its shipyards in Pillau , since 1683 in Emden . Throughout its existence , the company was underfunded , and expeditions were financed also by private capital , including payments by Raule and Frederick William . In July 1682 , an expedition under East Prussian Otto Friedrich von der <unk> was sent to Guinea to erect the fortress Großfriedrichsburg . On 24 February 1684 , another treaty with indigenous chiefs was signed that allowed the erection of a second fort in nearby <unk> ( now <unk> ) , named <unk> after Frederick William 's second wife . On 4 February 1685 , a treaty was signed with the chiefs of <unk> ( now Takoradi ) , some 30 kilometers east of Großfriedrichsburg . A fourth fort was built at a spring near the village of <unk> , between Großfriedrichsburg and <unk> , named Loge or Sophie @-@ Louise @-@ Schanze . Overall , the colony comprised roughly 50 kilometers of coastline , and did not extend into the hinterland . 
 = = = Arguin = = = 
 A second colony was established at the Arguin archipelago off the West African coast ( now part of Mauritania ) . In contrast to the Guinean colony , Arguin had been a colony before : In 1520 , Portugal had build a fort on the main island , which with all of Portugal came under Spanish control in 1580 . In 1638 it was conquered by the Dutch Republic , and in 1678 by France , who due to high maintenance costs abandoned it and demolished the fort soon after . On 27 July 1685 , an expedition was mounted by Frederick William and Raule , who took possession of the vacated colony on 1 October . Subsequently , the fort was rebuilt and contacts to the indigenous population established . France was alarmed and sent a vessel to re @-@ conquer the fort in late 1687 , but the attack of a French frigate and a smaller vessel was beaten back by the Brandenburg @-@ Prussian garrison . The victory improved the relations to the indigenous people , many of whom were carried off as slaves by the French before . While Arguin did not reach the economic importance of Großfriedrichsburg , it temporarily advanced to the world 's primary staple port for slaves .

 The African colonies enabled Brandenburg @-@ Prussia to participate in the Triangular trade , yet it lacked its own trading post in the Caribbean Sea . In 1684 , Brandenburg @-@ Prussia was denied the purchase of the French islands Sainte Croix and Saint Vincent . In November 1685 , after a failed attempt to purchase Saint Thomas from Denmark – Norway , a Brandenburg @-@ Danish agreement was reached that allowed the Brandenburg African Company to rent part of Saint Thomas as a base for 30 years , while the sovereignty remained with Denmark and administration with the Danish West Indies and Guinean Company . The first Brandenburgian vessel arrived in 1686 with 450 Slaves from Großfriedrichsburg . Brandenburg @-@ Prussia was allotted an area near the capital city Charlotte Amalie , called <unk> , and other territories named Krum Bay and Bordeaux Estates further west . In 1688 , 300 Europeans and several hundred slaves lived on the Brandenburgian estates . In November 1695 , French forces looted the Brandenburgian ( not the Danish ) colony . In 1731 , the Brandenburg @-@ Prussian company on Saint Thomas ( <unk> ) became insolvent , and abandoned the island in 1735 . Their last remains were sold by auction in 1738 . 
 Brandenburg @-@ Prussia tried to acquire Crab Island in 1687 , but the island was claimed also by Denmark , Great Britain and Spain , and when a second expedition in 1692 found the island in Danish hands , the plan was abandoned . 1689 , Brandenburg @-@ Prussia annexed Peter Island , but the small rock proved ineligible for trade or settlement . In 1691 , Brandenburg @-@ Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago , but since Courland was no longer present on the island which was meanwhile claimed by Great Britain , the agreement was nullified , and negotiations with Great Britain did not result in an agreement . In 1695 , Brandenburg @-@ Prussia tried to get a hold of Tortola , but Great Britain denied them settlement . Likewise , Great Britain declined an offer to purchase Sint Eustatius in 1697 .

While initially Naruto only shows small changes such as sharp teeth and claws , he later develops a red tail made of the Fox 's vital energy , or chakra . The red chakra starts by surrounding his body ; once four tails are manifested , Naruto 's blood starts merging with the chakra , coloring his entire body red . As the sixth tail appears , Naruto appears to wear the Fox 's skeleton . Once Naruto takes control of the fox 's chakra , he is able to maintain his regular form while using it .

 Naruto is an orphan who , as a newborn , had the dangerous fox @-@ like entity known as Kurama the Nine @-@ Tailed Fox sealed within his body by his father , the Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze , the leader of Konoha 's ninja force , at the cost of his own life . Because he became the host of the Nine Tails , Naruto was isolated by most of Konoha 's residents during his early childhood for being associated with him was considered taboo . Since then , Naruto has commonly made jokes and played pranks to attract attention . Desiring what he lacked in early life , Naruto dreams of becoming a Hokage himself with the hope that it will bring him the villagers ' recognition and respect . In an attempt to become a ninja , Naruto is horrified to learn of his Jinchuriki nature , but finds acceptance from his teacher <unk> <unk> , whom he views as a father . After learning the powerful Multi @-@ Shadow Clone Jutsu , an ability to creates physical copies of the user , Naruto becomes a ninja . He joins a ninja group under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake , where Naruto gains the friends he lacked during his childhood in his classmates who are also assigned to Team 7 : Sasuke Uchiha , with whom he has a rivalry with since they first met at the ninja academy , and Sakura Haruno . 
 While going through an exam to increase his ninja rank , Naruto meets the legendary ninja Jiraiya and learns how to summon toads to aid him in battle and to control part of the Nine Tails 's chakra energy . The exams are interrupted as a result of the invasion of Konohagakure by the criminal Orochimaru and the ninja of Sunagakure , with Naruto defeating the sand village 's One Tail Jinchuriki Gaara and convincing him of a better way to live . Shortly afterward , Naruto discovers the Akatsuki , a criminal organization that seeks to extract the Nine @-@ Tails from his body . Though Jiraiya drives them off during this first meeting , learning its member Itachi is both Sasuke 's brother and the man who killed their family , the Akatsuki still plan to kidnap Naruto . While accompanying Jiraiya to find a new leader for the village , Naruto also learns the Rasengan , a sphere of chakra for offensive purposes . When Sasuke leaves the village to join Orochimaru 's forces to obtain the power to kill Itachi , Naruto becomes part of a rescue team to retrieve him . Naruto and Sasuke ultimately have a one @-@ on @-@ one battle , though neither can convince himself to finish off the other . The two go their separate ways , but Naruto does not give up on Sasuke , leaving Konoha with Jiraiya to prepare himself for his next encounter with Sasuke and the Akatsuki . 
 After his two and a half years of training , Naruto returns to Konoha as begins to deal more actively with the Akatsuki threat by first saving Gaara from their clutches . To fight them , Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind @-@ element chakra , creating the Rasen @-@ <unk> attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member <unk> . Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki , Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke as he eventually deposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance @-@ driven whims . Over time , though resisting the urge to use the creature 's power , the Nine Tails 's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body which ultimately causes Naruto to go on a rampage , destroying everything in his path . 
 After learning that Jiraiya has been killed by the Akatsuki leader , Pain , Naruto prepares for a future encounter by learning toad @-@ style Senjutsu , a power @-@ enhancing ability involving the gathering of natural energy . When they finally face off , Naruto defeats Pain and convinces him to quit Akatsuki . At that time , Naruto learns that the Fourth Hokage was his father who sealed the Fox so that Naruto could use it to defeat the Akatsuki founder Tobi who was behind the Fox 's attack on Konohagakure . 
 When Naruto discovers Sasuke 's past role within the Akatsuki , his friend learning that Itachi acted in the village 's interests , he decides to confront Sasuke in battle which could end in both their deaths should Naruto be unable to save him . As a result , he prepares himself for the upcoming fights by becoming a student under the <unk> of <unk> the Eight Tails , Killer Bee , to take full control of Kurama 's powers . He succeeds with help from his late mother , <unk> Uzumaki , who placed a chakra imprint of herself within the seal . When Naruto learns that all his comrades are battling Tobi 's army to protect him , he takes Killer Bee to join the battle , eventually cooperating with Kurama . Across the battle , Naruto meets Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki , the Sage of the Six Paths , who grants him enhanced Senjutsu that allows him to heal most fatal injuries in order to face Madara along with the powers of all nine tailed beasts at his disposal . He later faces the force and true mastermind behind Madara 's actions : alien Princess Kaguya Ōtsutsuki , the core of the Ten Tails . Though Naruto manages to seal Kaguya with Sasuke 's help , he ends up forced to fight his friend when he reveals his true reason for helping him . Naruto convinces Sasuke to reconcile , losing his right arm from their final battle before later gaining a new limb created from Hashirama 's cells . Years later , Naruto is married to Hinata Hyuga with two children , Boruto and Himawari , and becomes the Seventh Hokage ( <unk> , <unk> Hokage ) after Kakashi 's retirement , last seen attending a Kage summit held in the Hidden Leaf .

 He also appears in all four original video animations produced for the series : helping his friend Konohamaru Sarutobi find a four @-@ leaf clover in the first ; escorting a ninja to his village and fighting the criminal who stole the village 's " Hero 's Water " in the second ; , participating in a tournament in the third and working with Team 7 in the fourth one . He appears as a supporting character in the spin @-@ off manga titled Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals where his fellow Konohagakure ninja Rock Lee is the main character . 
 Naruto is a playable character in the Naruto video games . In several titles , it is possible to access a special version of him enhanced with the power from the Nine @-@ Tailed Fox . In several games from the Ultimate Ninja series he is playable with his own versions of Rock Lee and Might Guy 's techniques while wearing their costume . Naruto Shippūden : Gekitou Ninja Taisen EX marks the first appearance of Naruto in his Part II appearance in a video game . For the series ' 10th anniversary , Masashi Kishimoto made an illustration of Naruto as Hokage . This portrayal of Naruto later appears as a secret character in the game Naruto Shippuden : Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 . He appears in several crossover video games that feature Naruto fighting against characters from other manga ; these games include Battle Stadium <unk> , Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars . A Naruto avatar made a guest appearance in the MMORPG Second Life for a Jump Festa promotion titled <unk> @ Second Life . In Dragon Ball Z : Battle of Z Naruto 's costume appears as an alternate costume for Goku . 
 = = Creation and conception = = 
 In the creation of Naruto , Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero : a straightforward way of thinking , a mischievous side , and attributes possessed by Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise . Aiming to keep Naruto " simple and stupid " , Kishimoto avoided modeling Naruto after anyone in particular , instead conceiving him as naïve with a dark side induced by his harsh past . Despite this , he is always optimistic , a trait Kishimoto says makes him unique . Naruto 's personality is , by and large , childish ; the creator tries to convey this trait in his illustrations . On the manga cover of volume 10 , for example , Naruto is depicted mimicking a turtle as a child might do . Naruto was Kishimoto 's first published manga , and he focused on how Naruto 's facial expressions would appear in difficult situations , trying make them consistent . He commented " It 's rather awkward to talk about what makes Naruto appealing to audiences , but I think his being a knucklehead gives him an appeal ; " He believed it was Naruto 's loses what made readers identify with him . However , he wanted Naruto to not feel defeat again which was his biggest objective when writing the series . 
 During the series ' publication , Kishimoto got married and had children which influenced Naruto 's character . This resulted in Naruto shortly meeting his parents and learning of their sacrifices to help him control the Fox inside him so that he could protect the world in their place . As a result , Naruto appreciated his life more and learned how his parents loved him , something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father . Naruto 's growth across the series surprised the author due to how the acknowledgement he receives from other characters allows the character even further . By the time Sasuke suffered a drastic change in the plot which made him become one of the series ' antagonists , Kishimoto compared Sasuke and Naruto to the yin and yang as a result of their notable differences . As a result , he mentions that whenever one of the two progresses , he makes sure the other does it too . Since the series started serialization , Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters . Still , he wanted the fight ending with Naruto forgiving Sasuke similar to the time Naruto forgave Nagato . Naruto 's romantic partner was also decided in the middle of the series . Since Hinata Hyuga always respected Naruto even before the series ' beginning , he felt they were meant to be . This angered Kishimoto 's wife who wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno . 
 While a realistic ninja wears black in order to be stealthy , Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange jumpsuit to fit the shonen genre . Naruto 's wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when he was younger . According to Kishimoto , a pre @-@ existing design would not have made Naruto unique , whereas something original would have made him too distinctive . Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects he uses , the designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume . Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots , but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals , because he enjoys drawing toes . The goggles that Naruto used to wear were replaced with a <unk> @-@ ite , or shinobi headband , because they were too time @-@ consuming to draw . One of the most difficult design choices was the color palette of Naruto 's outfit . The orange in his costume makes Naruto " pop " and the blue parts are often used as complements . Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto 's design , considering it too difficult to translate to animation . 
 Kishimoto was satisfied that he gave his character blond hair and blue eyes , something rarely seen in Japanese . Therefore , Naruto , along with the immense popularity the series has gained , comes naturally to the readers and international audiences with blond hair and blue eyes . Moreover , the editor of the American magazine Shonen Jump implied that these traits may have made the characters more appealing to Western audiences . Kishimoto most identifies with Naruto of all of the series ' characters . When asked why Naruto 's favorite food is ramen instead of kitsune udon , Kishimoto said that he personally liked eating ramen . In the Naruto : Clash of Ninja video game series , Naruto is playable in various stages of the Demon Fox 's manifestation , characterized by a red @-@ colored chakra . Kishimoto took inspiration from the games ' presentation of these forms , imitating one of them for the manga cover of volume 26 . When designing Naruto for his Part II appearance , Kishimoto drew Naruto 's forehead @-@ protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw , something that had bothered him in his previous design . He also noted that Naruto 's pants made the character look too childish . To remedy this , Kishimoto designed Naruto 's pants to roll up , giving him a more mature appearance . 
 In the original Japanese versions of Naruto , Naruto often ends his sentences with the addendum " <unk> " ( which achieves an effect similar to ending a sentence with " you know ? " in English ) . Kishimoto wanted to give Naruto a childlike catchphrase , and " <unk> " came to mind ; the creator believed that the phrase complements Naruto 's character , and serves as a verbal tic that portrays him in a brat @-@ ish manner . Throughout the first episodes of the English dub version , " <unk> " and " <unk> " were replaced with the phrase " Believe it ! " , both to mirror the effect and to match the character 's lip movements . 
 = = = Voice actors = = = 
 During the casting for the Japanese version of the animated adaptations , the staff sought a male voice actor for Naruto . Junko Takeuchi , a female actress , was instead chosen following a large number of auditions that involved male actors . Before recording the first episode , Takeuchi noticed several lines from the script that ended with exclamations points which helped her define Naruto 's voice . She noted difficulties in transitioning from the young Naruto to the older Naruto in the animated adaptation of Part II , as she had to record the first episode after the time skip only one week after voicing the character from before the time skip . This concerned the character 's growth as Naruto started acting more mature in contrast to his attitude of a child . It was difficult for Takeuchi to voice Naruto in his Nine @-@ Tailed Demon Fox form and during the fight against Sasuke , due to the suffering Naruto was going through . Nine years after first voicing the character , while still finding it tough to voice Naruto , Takeuchi 's opinion regarding him changed to " a very reliable young man " . She admires his ability to prioritize and calmly make important decisions , and believes these traits will inspire viewers worldwide . 
 The producers of the English anime stated that Naruto was the most difficult character to cast , adding that Maile Flanagan " has Naruto down , from the mischievous side , that precocious twelve @-@ year @-@ old we learn to love , to the serious side . " Flanagan did not listen to Junko Takeuchi 's performance of Naruto because she did not want to imitate it , stating : " I wanted to create my own voice for the character . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 In every official Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity poll of the series , Naruto ranks in the top five characters and as of the beginning of 2012 has been in first place twice . In 2006 , Naruto lost his top @-@ two status to the characters Deidara , Kakashi and Sasuke in the magazine 's sixth poll . In the 2011 poll , Naruto was once again in first place . Merchandise has been modeled after Naruto , including key chains , and action figures . In the 2009 Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards , Junko Takeuchi won " Best Voice Actress ( Japanese ) " for her work as Naruto . Naruto placed sixth in IGN 's Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie stating that although " Naruto actually isn 't the most popular character in his own series most of the time " , he is " the engine that powers the franchise " . In the 2011 Guinness World Records Gamer 's Edition , he was voted as the twenty @-@ ninth best character appearing in video games . While working for CyberConnect2 in the making of the .hack games , character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto used Naruto as a model for .hack 's protagonist , Kite . Incidentally , shortly afterwards CyberConnect2 started developing the Naruto : Ultimate Ninja games although Sadamoto recalls he was unaware of such fact . CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama also participated in the Paris Marathon 2012 while cosplaying as Naruto celebrating the release of a new video game . 
 Naruto 's character has received mostly positive critical response in printed and online publications . Praise was given by Joseph Szadkowski of The Washington Times who noted that Naruto " has become a pop @-@ culture sensation . " Naruto 's character was analyzed by GameSpot 's Joe Dodson who noted that Naruto , despite having an " ideal " life , still suffers from severe isolation . Nevertheless , he was praised for his optimistic personality by Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network ( <unk> ) . Writers from Mania Entertainment labeled him as a " good lead character " with good overall development despite certain initial problems . Writing for Popular Culture in Counseling , Psychotherapy , and Play @-@ Based Interventions , Lawrence Rubin stated that while Naruto has an optimistic and hyperactive personality , the Nine @-@ Tailed Demon Fox within his body symbolizes his negative emotions . Rubin concluded that Naruto 's fights to protect the village help him become a " complete and mature person " . On the other hand , Christina Carpenter of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews disagreed with other writers , noting that while Naruto is a " likable enough <unk> " , his type of character has been done before in many anime and manga series . 
 His relationships with the other characters have been deemed as appealing by IGN 's Charles White and Jason Van Horn , most notably his rivalry with Sasuke , as it shows " signs of maturity " in Naruto . However , his desire to retrieve Sasuke following the end of Part I received criticism as a result of his subsequent suffering . Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN listed Naruto and Sasuke as one of the " Anime 's Fiercest Frenemies " considering their similarities and how they turn into friends after a mortal battle . His <unk> involvement with other characters led to disputes as there were fans supporting him alongside Sakura Haruno and another with Hinata Hyuga . 
 Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network said that while Naruto 's initial fight scenes are lacking when compared to others , his encounter with Gaara is one of his best moments because it surpassed most shōnen stereotypes , owing to Naruto 's tactics . <unk> ' s Theron Martin and Mania Entertainment 's Justin Rich made similar comments . The character 's final fight against Sasuke in the end of Part I received like responses , due to the fighting styles employed , and the character development resulting from their rivalry . The enormous physical changes caused by the Nine @-@ Tailed Demon Fox have also been the focus of critics , as Naruto 's loss of control causes him to become a bigger threat to his loved ones than series ' antagonists . Carlo Santos of Anime News Network commented on the character 's growth in Part II , specifically his fight against Pain in which Naruto 's comments on peace and the means by which it is achieved touch on philosophical themes never seen in a shōnen series . Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment noted a change in Naruto 's attitude as he acts more calm and serious than in previous story arcs . Naruto 's new Senjutsu style was praised as was his careful preparation for the fight against Pain , which resulted in a big display of Naruto 's skills . 
 = Struthiosaurinae = 
 Struthiosaurinae is a subfamily of ankylosaurian dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Europe . It is defined as " the most inclusive clade containing Europelta but not <unk> , <unk> , Sauropelta or Edmontonia " while being reinstated for a newly recognized clade of basal nodosaurids . Struthiosaurinae appeared at about exactly the same time as the North American subfamily Nodosaurinae . <unk> range all across the Cretaceous , the oldest genus being Europelta at an age of 112 Ma and the youngest being Struthiosaurus at about 85 – 66 Ma . 
 It was originally mentioned by Franz Nopcsa in 1923 as a subfamily of Acanthopholidae , along with the previously defined Acanthopholinae . The family has gone through many taxonomic revisions since it was defined by Nopcsa in 1902 . It is now recognized as a junior synonym of the family Nodosauridae . The subfamily now includes the genera Anoplosaurus , Europelta , Hungarosaurus , and Struthiosaurus , designated as the type genus . Because of the instability of Acanthopholis , the generic namesake of Acanthopholinae , and its current identification as a nomen dubium , Struthiosaurinae , the next named group , was decidedly used over the older one . 
 A review of ankylosaur osteoderms was published in 2000 , and reviewed the armour of Struthiosaurinae . The group was represented by the single genus Struthiosaurus , known from head , cervical , dorsal , sacral , and caudal scutes . Only a few head osteoderms were identified , so it is unknown how much of the skull was armoured . Many cervical and dorsal scutes have been preserved alongside species of Struthiosaurus . They include cervical bands , which are groups of osteoderms fused together and attached to the vertebrae , and large spines found on the shoulders of nodosaurids like Sauropelta and Edmontonia , although it is not known if the spines were fused like the later of separate like the former . It is quite possible that small ovoid scutes found on Struthiosaurus could have formed a pelvic shield like polacanthids . The caudal scutes of struthiosaurines are small and rough . Even though osteoderms are well @-@ known , it is not certain where they were positioned on the body .

 Struthiosaurinae is a group named by Franz Nopcsa , that was reinstated by James Kirkland for a group of just @-@ european nodosaurids . 
 = = = History = = = 
 Baron Franz Nopcsa , in 1902 , proposed a new grouping of dinosaurs , Acanthopholididae , a clade of lightly @-@ built thyreophorans . He included in it the genera Acanthopholis , Polacanthus , <unk> , Struthiosaurus , and possibly <unk> . Soon after , he also added <unk> and Palaeoscincus . He considered Acanthopholididae to be the sister clade to Stegosauridae , and also stated that it might include Hylaeosaurus , which he found had most of the characteristics of the family . Later , in 1915 , he rearranged the species included in it . The genera that were later included were Acanthopholis ( = Anoplosaurus ) , Polacanthus , Stegopelta , Stegoceras , and Struthiosaurus . Along with Ankylosaurus , Acanthopholididae was defined to form a subfamily of Nodosauridae . In 1923 he divided up the family into two subfamilies without comment . These two subfamilies were named Acanthopholinae and Struthiosaurinae . 
 In the same year , he corrected the subgroups of Thyreophora . He placed Acanthopholididae , Stegosauridae and Ceratopsidae together inside the group . Five years later , he corrected the name of the family to Acanthopholidae , which is now the correct spelling . In the same publication , he also changed the genera included . He assigned Hylaeosaurus , Stegoceras , Struthiosaurus , and Troodon inside it but moved Stegopelta and Ankylosaurus into the family Ankylosauridae . Nopcsa then downgraded the phylogenetic rank of Acanthopholidae to make it a subfamily inside Nodosauridae . The clade was defined to include Ankylosaurus and Acanthopholinae . Inside Acanthopholinae he placed Acanthopholis , Hylaeosaurus , <unk> , Struthiosaurus , and Troodon . Now considered as an artificial grouping , it was defined to include dinosaur taxa now considered to be polacanthids , a pachycephalosaur and Acanthopholis , a genus that is widely considered to be dubious . Acanthopholidae and Acanthopholinae are now dubious groups since the validity of Acanthopholis has changed . 
 = = = Phylogeny = = = 
 Historically , Struthiosaurinae has been considered a junior synonym of the family Nodosauridae by Walter P. Coombs in 1978 and Tatyana <unk> in 1987 , or a sister clade to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> by Tracy L. Ford in 2000 . Kirkland and his colleagues followed Ford in using Struthiosaurinae as a clade of basal nodosaurids , but concluded that the only other subfamily of Nodosauridae was Nodosaurinae . According to Kirkland et al . , Acanthopholinae was not an acceptable classification for the new clade of previously unrecognized nodosaurids because of the instability of Acanthopholis . Struthiosaurinae was decided on as the name of the clade , as it was the next published term after Acanthopholinae . To ensure the group was rendered valid , Kirkland et al. redefined Struthiosaurinae as the most inclusive clade containing Europelta but not <unk> , <unk> , Sauropelta , or Edmontonia .

Below is a cladogram from before the recognition of the clade Struthiosaurinae . 
 = = Description = = 
 <unk> are well @-@ known , and include one of the best @-@ preserved species of ankylosaur , Europelta <unk> . 
 = = = Osteoderms = = = 
 In 2000 , Ford published a complete description of ankylosaurian osteoderms , in which he recognized the group Struthiosaurinae . Ford 's description of Struthiosaurinae was based on the genus Struthiosaurus . Ford found that Struthiosaurus <unk> lacked any remains of the jugal , which makes a jugal scute unknown . The skull roof of T. <unk> is large and bulbous , preserving a large , flat scute on top , and no osteoderms behind the orbits . Another species , S. <unk> , is known from two incomplete skulls , which preserved irregular scutes parallel to the orbits along the cranium . 
 <unk> from the postcranial region of the skeleton are also known from struthiosaurines . Cervical bands have been found on S. <unk> , as well as S. sp .. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups of two or three osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the medial edge , and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks . The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape . One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side @-@ to @-@ side and was as long as the whole band itself . The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point , and the upper side of the scute has a smooth , lightly arching shape . Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms with flat tops and rounded bottoms . The exact placement of cervical bands is not known . In 1995 , <unk> @-@ <unk> et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement , the bands would have been horizontal along the body , with the neural spine in the middle of the back . That positioning would mean that the medial scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size , and together they would either fuse , like in Edmontonia , or touch , as in Sauropelta . Another possibility , suggested by Ford , was that the bands were along the side of the neck , pointing dorsally . If oriented along the side , the primary scutes would have pointed up and down , like in polacanthids , and the medial scutes would , by definition , become secondary osteoderms . The set of medial scutes ( or secondary ) would be possibly oval in shape . 
 <unk> scutes on struthiosaurines are oval to teardrop shaped , and possess sharp ridges that rise distally . Some scutes were long and had small domes on them . The first primary osteoderms on the pelvis are large , compressed from the sides , and have a sharp , short point . S. sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from the pelvis . One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle , joining the two together , and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike . It is thought that the fragment was from the edge of the pelvic region . Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small ossicles fused between them . Pelvic shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes . 
 Caudal scutes have been preserved on struthiosaurines . The osteoderms are compressed inwards from the side , have a slope positioned anteriorly , and a square @-@ shaped posterior edge . 
 = = = Distinguishing anatomical features = = = 
 All ankylosaurs that possess these characteristics - a narrow predentary ; a nearly horizontal quadrate that is not fused and is oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof ; the presence of mandibular condyles that are three times wider than long ; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near a symphysis with the front of the lower jaw ( the predentary ) ; a sacrum arched on top ; an acromion process above the midpoint of the scapula to coracoid attachment ; a straight ischium with a straight dorsal margin ; relatively long , slender limbs ; sacral shield armour ; and the presence of erect pelvic osteoderms with flat bases - form a clade of basal nodosaurids , the Struthiosaurinae . That set of cranial and postcranial features are only present on genera considered to be in the clade . The features above distinguish Struthiosaurinae from other clades and genera found by other analysis ' . 
 = = Biogeography = = 
 The near simultaneous appearance of nodosaurids in both North America and Europe is worthy of consideration , because at the time , they were separated from each other by a huge body of water . Europelta is the oldest nodosaurid from Europe ; it is derived from the lower Albian <unk> Formation . The oldest western North American nodosaurid is Sauropelta , from the lower Albian Little Sheep Mudstone Member of the Cloverly Formation , at an age of 108 @.@ 5 ± 0 @.@ 2 million years . Eastern North American fossils seem older . Teeth of <unk> <unk> have been derived from the Arundel Clay of the Potomac Group of Maryland , which dates near the Aptian – Albian boundary . A <unk> hatchling was uncovered from the base of the underlying Patuxent Formation , dated to the upper Aptian , making <unk> the oldest nodosaurid . 
 <unk> are known from pre @-@ Aptian fauna from both Europe and North America . The timing of the appearance of nodosaurids on both continents indicates the origins of the clade preceded the isolation of North America and Europe , thereby pushing the group 's date of evolution back to at least the middle Aptian . The separation of Nodosauridae into European Struthiosaurinae and North American Nodosaurinae by the end of the Aptian provides a revised date for the isolation of the continents from each other with rising sealevel . 
 Struthiosaurinae is one of the longest @-@ lasting groups of ankylosaurians . They range from Europelta at 112 Ma to Struthiosaurus , which lived until the uppermost Cretaceous , or 66 Ma . In between those two early and late struthiosaurines are the genera Anoplosaurus and Hungarosaurus . Hungarosaurus is younger , at about 85 Ma , from the late Santonian of the <unk> Formation . Anoplosaurus is a fair amount older , at about 100 Ma , from the late Albian Cambridge Greensand . 
 = Thunderball ( novel ) = 
 Thunderball is the ninth book in Ian Fleming 's James Bond series , and the eighth full @-@ length James Bond novel . It was first published in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 27 March 1961 , where the initial print run of 50 @,@ 938 copies quickly sold out . The first novelization of an unfilmed James Bond screenplay , it was born from a collaboration by five people : Ian Fleming , Kevin McClory , Jack Whittingham , Ivar Bryce and Ernest Cuneo , although the controversial shared credit of Fleming , McClory and Whittingham was the result of a courtroom decision . 
 The story centres on the theft of two atomic bombs by the crime syndicate SPECTRE and the subsequent attempted blackmail of the Western powers for their return . James Bond , Secret Service operative 007 , travels to the Bahamas to work with his friend Felix Leiter , seconded back into the CIA for the investigation . Thunderball also introduces SPECTRE 's leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld , in the first of three appearances in Bond novels , with On Her Majesty 's Secret Service and You Only Live Twice being the others . 
 Thunderball has been adapted three times , once in a comic strip format for the Daily Express newspaper and twice for the cinema . The Daily Express strip was cut short on the order of its owner , Lord Beaverbrook , after Ian Fleming signed an agreement with The Sunday Times to publish a short story . On screen , Thunderball was released in 1965 as the fourth film in the Eon Productions series , with Sean Connery as James Bond . The second adaptation , Never Say Never Again , was released as an independent production in 1983 also starring Connery as Bond and was produced by Kevin McClory . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Thunderball begins with a meeting between Bond and his superior , M , during which the agent is told that his latest physical assessment is poor because of excessive drinking and smoking ( up to sixty cigarettes a day ) . M sends Bond on a two @-@ week treatment at the Shrublands health clinic to improve his health . At the clinic Bond encounters Count Lippe , a member of the Red Lightning Tong criminal organisation from Macau . When Bond learns of the Tong connection , Lippe tries to kill him by tampering with a spinal traction machine . Bond , however , is saved by nurse Patricia Fearing and later retaliates against Lippe by trapping him in a steam bath , resulting in the Count 's second @-@ degree burns and a week 's stay in hospital . 
 The Prime Minister receives a communiqué from SPECTRE ( <unk> Executive for Counter @-@ intelligence , Terrorism , Revenge and Extortion ) explaining that the organisation has hijacked a Villiers Vindicator and seized its two nuclear bombs , which it will use to destroy two major cities unless a £ 100 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ransom is paid . This is SPECTRE 's Plan Omega . SPECTRE is headed by criminal mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld . Count Lippe was dispatched to Shrublands to oversee Giuseppe Petacchi of the Italian Air Force , at the Boscombe Down Airfield , a bomber squadron base . Although Lippe was successful , Blofeld considered him unreliable , because of his childish clash with Bond and , as a consequence , Blofeld has Lippe killed . 
 Acting as a NATO observer of Royal Air Force procedure , Petacchi is in SPECTRE 's pay to hijack the bomber in mid @-@ flight by killing its crew and flying it to the Bahamas . Once there , Petacchi is killed and the plane , with bombs , are taken by Emilio Largo ( aka SPECTRE Number One ) on board the cruiser yacht Disco Volante . 
 The Americans and the British launch Operation Thunderball to foil SPECTRE and recover the two atomic bombs . On a hunch , M assigns Bond to the Bahamas to investigate . There , Bond meets Felix Leiter , seconded to the CIA from his usual role at Pinkertons because of the Thunderball crisis . While in Nassau , Bond meets <unk> " Domino " Vitali , Largo 's mistress and the sister of the dead pilot Giuseppe Petacchi . She is living on board the Disco Volante and believes Largo is on a treasure hunt , although Largo makes her stay ashore while he and his partners hunt hidden treasure . After seducing her , Bond informs her that Largo killed her brother ; Bond then recruits her to spy on Largo . Domino re @-@ boards the Disco Volante with a Geiger counter to ascertain if the yacht is where the two nuclear bombs are hidden . However , she is discovered and Largo tortures her for information . 
 Bond and Leiter alert the Thunderball war room of their suspicions of Largo and join the crew of the American nuclear submarine Manta as the ransom deadline nears . The Manta chases the Disco Volante to capture it and recover the bombs en route to the first target . An undersea battle ensues between the crews , while Bond fights Largo . Bond , now very weak from his efforts to disable the bombs , tries to get away , but Largo corners him in an underwater cave and easily overpowers him . Before Largo can finish Bond off Domino shoots him with a spear gun . The bombs are recovered and Bond is sent to hospital with Domino . 
 = = Characters and themes = = 
 According to continuation Bond author Raymond Benson , there was further development of the Bond character in Thunderball , with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his own sense of mortality being shown . Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though , whilst his incapacity , suffered in Live and Let Die , had not led to bitterness or to him being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene towards the end of the novel . 
 Academic Christoph Linder sees Thunderball as part of the second wave of Bond villains : the first wave consisted of SMERSH , the second of Blofeld and SPECTRE , undertaken because of the thawing of relations between East and West , although the cold war heated up again shortly afterwards , with the Bay of Pigs Invasion , the construction of the Berlin Wall and the Cuban Missile Crisis all occurring in an eighteen @-@ month period from April 1961 – November 1962 . The introduction of SPECTRE and its use over a number of books gives a measure of continuity to the remaining stories in the series , according to academic Jeremy Black . Black argues that SPECTRE represents " evil unconstrained by ideology " and it partly came about because the decline of the British Empire led to a lack of certainty in Fleming 's mind . This is reflected in Bond using US equipment and personnel in the novel , such as the Geiger counter and nuclear submarine . 
 = = Background = = 
 As with the previous novels in the series , aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming 's own experiences : the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the <unk> Hall health farm and Bond 's medical record , as read out to him by M , is a slightly modified version of Fleming 's own . The name of the health farm , Shrublands , was taken from that of a house owned by the parents of his wife 's friend , Peter Quennell . Fleming dedicates a quarter of the novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes . 
 Bond 's examination of the hull of the Disco Volante was inspired by the ill @-@ fated mission undertaken on 19 April 1956 by the ex @-@ Royal Navy frogman " Buster " Crabb on behalf of MI6 , as he examined the hull of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze that had brought Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin on a diplomatic mission to Britain . Crabb disappeared in Portsmouth Harbour and was never seen again . As well as having Buster Crabb in mind , Fleming would also recall the information about the 10th Light Flotilla , an elite unit of Italian navy frogmen who used wrecked ships in Gibraltar to launch attacks on Allied shipping . The specifications for the Disco Volante herself had been obtained by Fleming from the Italian ship designer , Leopold Rodriguez . 
 As often happened in Fleming 's novels , a number of names were taken from people of whom he had known . Ernst Stavro Blofeld 's name partially comes from Tom Blofeld , a Norfolk farmer and a fellow member of Fleming 's club Boodle 's , who was a contemporary of Fleming 's at Eton . Tom Blofeld 's son is Henry Blofeld , a sports journalist , best known as a cricket commentator for Test Match Special on BBC Radio . Additionally , when Largo rents his beachside villa , it is from " an Englishman named Bryce " , whose name was taken from Old Etonian Ivar Bryce , Fleming 's friend , who had a beachside property in Jamaica called Xanadu . 
 Other names used by Fleming included a colleague at The Sunday Times , Robert Harling , who was transformed into Commissioner of Police Harling , whilst an ex @-@ colleague from his stock broking days , Hugo Pitman , became Chief of Immigration Pitman and Fleming 's golfing friend , Bunny Roddick , became Deputy Governor Roddick . The title Thunderball came from a conversation Fleming had about a US atomic test .

 = = = = Chronology = = = = 
 In the summer of 1958 Fleming and his friend , Ivar Bryce , began talking about the possibility of a Bond film ; in the autumn of 1958 Bryce introduced Fleming to a young Irish writer and director , Kevin McClory , and the three of them , together with Fleming and Bryce 's friend Ernest Cuneo , formed the partnership Xanadu Productions , named after Bryce 's Bahamian home , but which was never actually formed into a company . In May 1959 Fleming , Bryce , Cuneo and McClory met first at Bryce 's Essex house and then in McClory 's London home as they came up with a story outline which was based on an aeroplane full of celebrities and a female lead called Fatima Blush . McClory was fascinated by the underwater world and wanted to make a film that included it . Over the next few months , as the story changed , there were ten outlines , treatments and scripts . Numerous titles were proposed for these works , including SPECTRE , James Bond of the Secret Service and Longitude 78 West . 
 Much of the attraction Fleming felt working alongside McClory was based on McClory 's film , The Boy and the Bridge , which was the official British entry to the 1959 Venice Film Festival . However , when the film was released in July 1959 , it was poorly received , and did not do well at the box office ; Fleming became disenchanted with McClory 's ability as a result . In October 1959 , with Fleming spending less time on the project , McClory introduced experienced screenwriter Jack Whittingham to the writing process . In November 1959 Fleming left to travel around the world on behalf of The Sunday Times , material for which Fleming also used for his non @-@ fiction travel book , Thrilling Cities . On his travels – through Japan , Hong Kong and into the US – Fleming met with McClory and Ivar Bryce in New York and McClory told Fleming that Whittingham had completed a full outline , which was ready to shoot . Back in Britain in December 1959 , Fleming met with McClory and Whittingham for a script conference ; shortly afterwards McClory and Whittingham sent Fleming a script , Longitude 78 West , which Fleming considered to be good , although he changed the title to Thunderball . 
 In January 1960 McClory visited Fleming 's Jamaican home Goldeneye , where Fleming explained his intention of delivering the screenplay to MCA , with a recommendation from him and Bryce that McClory act as producer . Additionally , Fleming told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory 's involvement , then McClory should either sell himself to MCA , back out of the deal , or file suit in court . 
 Fleming then wrote the novel Thunderball at Goldeneye over the period January to March 1960 , based on the screenplay written by himself , Whittingham and McClory . In March 1961 McClory read an advance copy of the book and he and Whittingham immediately petitioned the High Court in London for an injunction to stop publication . The plagiarism case was heard on 24 March 1961 and allowed the book to be published , although the door was left open for McClory to pursue further action at a later date . He did so and on 19 November 1963 , the case of McClory v Fleming was heard at the Chancery Division of the High Court . The case lasted three weeks , during which time Fleming was unwell — including having a heart attack during the case itself — and , under advice from his friend Ivar Bryce , they offered a deal to McClory , settling out of court . McClory gained the literary and film rights for the screenplay , while Fleming was given the rights to the novel , although it had to be recognised as being " based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory , Jack Whittingham and the Author " . On settlement , " Fleming ultimately admitted ' [ t ] hat the novel reproduces a substantial part of the copyright material in the film scripts ' ; ' [ t ] hat the novel makes use of a substantial number of the incidents and material in the film scripts ' ; and ' [ t ] hat there is a general similarity of the story of the novel and the story as set out in the said film scripts ' . " On 12 August 1964 , nine months after the conclusion of the trial , Fleming suffered a further heart attack and died at the age of 56 . The plagiarism case and its aftermath were documented in detail in the 2008 book , The Battle for Bond , by Robert Sellers . 
 = = = = Script elements = = = = 
 When the script was first drafted in May 1959 , with the storyline of an aeroplane of celebrities in the Atlantic , it included elements from Fleming 's friend Ernie Cuneo , who included ships with underwater trapdoors in their hulls and an underwater battle scene . The Russians were originally the villains , then the Sicilian Mafia , but this was later changed again to the internationally operating criminal organisation , SPECTRE . Both McClory and Fleming claim to have come up with the concept of SPECTRE ; Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett and John Cork both note Fleming as the originator of the group , Lycett saying that " [ Fleming ] proposed that Bond should confront not the Russians but SPECTRE ... " whilst Cork produced a memorandum in which Fleming called for the change to SPECTRE : 
 Cork also noted that Fleming used the word " spectre " previously : in the fourth novel , Diamonds Are Forever , for a town near Las Vegas called " Spectreville " , and for " <unk> " , the <unk> decoder in From Russia , with Love . Others , such as continuation Bond author Raymond Benson , disagree , saying that McClory came up with the SPECTRE concept . 
 Those elements which Fleming used which can be put down to McClory and Whittingham ( either separately or together ) include the airborne theft of a nuclear bomb , " Jo " Petachi and his sister Sophie , and Jo 's death at the hands of Sophie 's boss . The remainder of the screenplay was a two @-@ year collaboration among Fleming , Whittingham , McClory , Bryce and Cuneo .

 Thunderball was published on 27 March 1961 in the UK as a hardcover edition by publishers Jonathan Cape ; it was 253 pages long and cost 15 shillings . 50 @,@ 938 copies were printed and quickly sold out . Thunderball was published in the US by Viking Press and sold better than any of the previous Bond books . Publishers Jonathan Cape spent £ 2 @,@ 000 ( £ 40 @,@ 149 in 2016 pounds ) on advance publicity . Cape sent out 130 review copies to critics and others and 32 @,@ 000 copies of the novel had been sent to 864 UK booksellers and 603 outside the UK . 
 Artist Richard Chopping once again provided the cover art for the novel . On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping to ask if he could undertake the art for the next book , agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas , saying that " I will ask [ Jonathan Cape ] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts . As to the dagger , I really have no strong views . I had thought of the ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on people like you and me , but if you have a nice dagger in mind please let us use it . The title of the book will be Thunderball . It is immensely long , immensely dull and only your jacket can save it ! " 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 Thunderball was generally well received by the critics ; Francis Iles , writing in The Guardian wrote that it " is a good , tough , straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines . " Referring to the negative publicity that surrounded Dr. No — in particular the article by Paul Johnson in the New Statesman entitled , " Sex , Snobbery and Sadism " — Iles was left " wondering what all the fuss is about " , noting that " there is no more sadism nor sex than is expected of the author of this kind of thriller " . Peter Duval Smith , writing in Financial Times , also took the opportunity to defend Fleming 's work against negative criticism , also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review : " one should not make a cult of Fleming 's novels : a day @-@ dream is a day @-@ dream ; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing . " Duval Smith thought that Thunderball was " an exciting story is skilfully told " , with " a romantic sub @-@ plot ... and the denouement involves great events " He also considered it " the best written since Diamonds Are Forever , four books back . It has pace and humour and style . The violence is not so unrelenting as usual : an improvement , I think . " He also expressed concern for the central character , saying " I was glad to see him [ Bond ] in such good form . Earlier he seemed to be softening up . He was having bad hangovers on half @-@ a @-@ bottle of whisky a day , which I don 't call a lot , unless he wasn 't eating properly . " 
 Writing in The Times Literary Supplement , Phillip Stead thought that Fleming " continues <unk> to deploy his story @-@ telling talents within the limits of the Commander Bond formula . " Stead saw that the hijacking of the two bombs " gives Bond some anxiety but , needless to say , does not prevent him from having a good deal of fun in luxury surroundings " , whilst " the usual beatings @-@ up , modern style , are ingeniously administered to lady and gentleman like " . As to why the novels were so appealing , Stead considered that " Mr. Fleming 's special magic lies in his power to impart sophistication to his mighty nonsense ; his fantasies connect with up @-@ to @-@ date and lively knowledge of places and of the general sphere of crime and espionage . " Overall , in Stead 's opinion , with Thunderball " the mixture , exotic as ever , generates an extravagant and exhilarating tale and Bond connoisseurs will be glad to have it . " The critic for The Times wrote that Thunderball " relies for its kicks far less than did Dr. No or Goldfinger on sadism and a slightly condescending sophistication . " The upshot , in the critic 's opinion , was that " the mixture — of good living , sex and violent action — is as before , but this is a highly polished performance , with an ingenious plot well documented and plenty of excitement . " 
 Writing in The Washington Post , Harold Kneeland noted that Thunderball was " Not top Fleming , but still well ahead of the pack " , whilst Charles Poore , writing in The New York Times considered the Bond novels to be " post @-@ <unk> ventures in crime and punishment " . Thunderball he found to be " a mystery story , a thriller , a chiller and a pleasure to read . " Poore identified aspects of the author 's technique to be part of the success , saying " the suspense and the surprises that animate the novel arise from the conceits with which Mr. Fleming decorates his tapestry of thieving and deceiving " . 
 The critic from The Sunday Times considered Fleming to have " a sensational imagination , but informed by style , zest and — above all — knowledge " . Anthony Boucher wrote that " As usual , Ian Fleming has less story to tell in 90 @,@ 000 words than Buchan managed in 40 @,@ 000 ; but Thunderball is still an extravagant adventure " . The critic for the Daily Herald implored " Hey ! — that man is taking his clothes off again . So is the girl ... Can anybody stop this ? Unfortunately not . Not this side of the best @-@ seller lists . I don 't envy Mr Bond 's wealthy creator , Ian Fleming . I wish I could pity him " , whilst L.G. Offord considered Thunderball to be " just about as wild as ever , with a walloping climax . "

 Comic strip ( 1961 – 1962 ) 
 A comic strip adaptation was published daily in the Daily Express newspaper and syndicated worldwide , beginning on 11 December 1961 . However , the owner of the Daily Express , Lord Beaverbrook , cancelled the strip on 10 February 1962 after Fleming signed an agreement with The Sunday Times for them to publish the short story " The Living Daylights " . Thunderball was reprinted in 2005 by Titan Books as part of the Dr. No anthology that also includes Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia , with Love . 
 Thunderball ( 1965 ) 
 In 1965 , the film Thunderball was released , starring Sean Connery as James Bond . The film was produced as the fourth Eon Productions film and , as well as listing Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman as producers , Kevin McClory was also included in the production team : Broccoli and Saltzman made a deal with McClory , to undertake a joint production of Thunderball , which stopped McClory from making any further version of the novel for a period of ten years following the release of the Eon @-@ produced version . Thunderball premiered in Tokyo on 9 December 1965 , grossing $ 141 @.@ 2 million at the global box office . 
 Never Say Never Again ( 1983 ) 
 In 1983 Kevin McClory produced a version of the Thunderball story , again with Sean Connery as Bond . The film premiered in New York on 7 October 1983 , grossing $ 9 @.@ 72 million ( $ 23 million in 2016 dollars ) on its first weekend , which was reported to be " the best opening record of any James Bond film " up to that point . 
 Warhead ( 1990s ) 
 In the 1990s , McClory announced plans to make another adaption of the Thunderball story , Warhead 2000 AD , with Timothy Dalton or Liam Neeson in the lead role , but this was eventually dropped . 
 = The Quatermass Experiment = 
 The Quatermass Experiment is a British science @-@ fiction serial broadcast by BBC Television during the summer of 1953 and re @-@ staged by BBC Four in 2005 . Set in the near future against the background of a British space programme , it tells the story of the first manned flight into space , supervised by Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group . When the spaceship that carried the first successful crew returns to Earth , two of the three astronauts are missing , and the third is behaving strangely . It becomes apparent that an alien presence entered the ship during its flight , and Quatermass and his associates must prevent the alien from destroying the world . 
 Originally comprising six half @-@ hour episodes , it was the first science @-@ fiction production to be written especially for an adult television audience in Britain . Previous written @-@ for @-@ television efforts such as Stranger from Space ( 1951 – 52 ) were aimed at children , whereas adult entries into the genre were adapted from literary sources , such as R.U.R. ( 1938 and again in 1948 ) and The Time Machine ( 1949 ) . The serial was the first of four Quatermass productions to be screened on British television between 1953 and 1979 , and was transmitted live from the BBC 's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London , one of the final productions before BBC television drama moved to west London . 
 As well as spawning various remakes and sequels , The Quatermass Experiment inspired much of the television science fiction that succeeded it , particularly in the United Kingdom , where it influenced successful series such as Doctor Who and Sapphire and Steel . It also influenced successful Hollywood films such as 2001 : A Space Odyssey and Alien . 
 = = Production = = 
 The serial was written by BBC television drama writer Nigel Kneale , who had been an actor and an award @-@ winning fiction writer before joining the BBC . The BBC 's Head of Television Drama , Michael Barry , had committed most of his original script budget for the year to employing Kneale . An interest in science , particularly the idea of ' science going bad ' , led Kneale to write The Quatermass Experiment . The project originated when a gap formed in the BBC 's schedules for a six @-@ week serial to run on Saturday nights during the summer of 1953 , and Kneale 's idea was to fill it with " a mystifying , rather than horrific " storyline . 
 Rudolph Cartier , one of the BBC 's best @-@ regarded directors , directed the serial . He and Kneale had collaborated on the play Arrow to the Heart , and worked closely on the initial storyline to make it suit the television production methods of the time . Kneale claimed to have picked his leading character 's unusual last name at random from a London telephone directory . He chose the character 's first name , Bernard , in honour of astronomer Bernard Lovell . The working titles for the production were The <unk> and Bring Something Back ... ! , the latter a line of dialogue in the second episode . Kneale had not finished scripting the final two episodes of the serial before the first episode was transmitted . The production had an overall budget of just under £ 4000 . The theme music used was " Mars , Bringer of War " from Gustav Holst 's The Planets . 
 Each episode was rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London , with camera rehearsals taking place all day on Saturday before transmission . The episodes were then transmitted live — with a few pre @-@ filmed 35mm film inserts shot before and during the rehearsal period — from Studio A of the BBC 's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London . It was one of the last major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace , as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios , and it was made using the BBC 's oldest television cameras , the <unk> , installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936 . These cameras gave a ( by modern standards ) poor @-@ quality picture , with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image . 
 The Quatermass Experiment was transmitted weekly on Saturday night from 18 July to 22 August 1953 . Episode one ( " Contact Has Been Established " ) was scheduled from 8 @.@ 15 to 8 @.@ 45 p.m. ; episode two ( " Persons Reported Missing " ) , 8 @.@ 25 – 8 @.@ 55 p.m. ; episodes three and four ( " Very Special Knowledge " and " Believed to be Suffering " ) , 8 @.@ 45 – 9 @.@ 15 p.m. ; and the final two episodes ( " An Unidentified Species " and " State of Emergency " ) from 9 @.@ 00 to 9 @.@ 30 p.m. Due to the live performances , each episode overran its slot slightly , from two minutes ( episode four ) to six ( episode six ) . The long overrun of the final episode was caused by a temporary break in transmission to replace a failing microphone . Kneale later claimed that the BBC 's transmission controllers had threatened to take them off the air during one significant overrun , to which Cartier replied , " Just let them try ! " Some BBC documentation suggests that at least one transmitter region did cut short the broadcast of the final episode . 
 The BBC intended that each episode be telerecorded onto 35mm film , a relatively new process that allowed for the preservation of live television broadcasts . Sale of the serial had been provisionally agreed with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , and Cartier wanted the material available to use for trailers and recaps . Only poor @-@ quality copies of the first two episodes were recorded before the idea was abandoned , although the first of these was later shown in Canada . During the telerecording of the second episode , an insect landed on the screen being filmed , and can be seen on the image for several minutes . It is very unlikely that material from the third to sixth episodes of the serial will ever be recovered to the BBC 's archives . The two existing episodes are the oldest surviving examples of a multi @-@ episodic British drama production , and some of the earliest existing examples of British television drama at all , with only a few earlier one @-@ off plays surviving . 
 In November 1953 , it was suggested that the existing two episodes could be combined and followed with a condensed live production of the latter part of the story for a special Christmas omnibus repeat of the serial . This idea was abandoned . Although Cartier and star Reginald Tate were keen to make an all @-@ film omnibus version for television , this also did not come to fruition . In 1963 , one of the existing episodes was selected as a representative of early British programming for the Festival of World Television at the National Film Theatre in London . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Along with his laboratory assistants , Professor Bernard Quatermass anxiously awaits the return to Earth of his new rocket ship and its crew , who have become the first humans to travel into space . The rocket is at first thought to be lost , having dramatically overshot its planned orbit , but eventually it is detected by radar and returns to Earth , crash @-@ landing in Wimbledon , London . 
 When Quatermass and his team reach the crash area and succeed in opening the rocket , they discover that only one of the three crewmen , Victor Carroon , remains inside . Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson ( Hugh Kelly ) investigate the interior of the rocket , and are baffled by what they find : the space suits of the others are present , and the instruments on board indicate that the door was never opened in flight , but there is no sign of the other two crewmen . 
 Carroon , gravely ill , is cared for by the Rocket Group 's doctor , Briscoe ( John Glen ) , who has been having a secret affair with Carroon 's wife , Judith ( Isabel Dean ) . It is not just Quatermass who is interested in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates ; journalists such as James Fullalove ( Paul Whitsun @-@ Jones ) and Scotland Yard 's Inspector Lomax ( Ian Colin ) are also keen to hear his story . Carroon is abducted by a group of foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space . It is clear that there is something critically wrong : he appears to have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members , and is slowly mutating into a plant @-@ like alien organism . 
 As the police chase the rapidly transforming Carroon across London , Quatermass analyses samples of the mutated creature in a laboratory , and realises that it has the ability to end all life on Earth if it spores . A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the monster in Westminster Abbey , and Quatermass and troops of the British Army rush in to destroy it in the hour before it brings about doomsday . Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it ; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism .

 Following the success of The Quatermass Experiment , Nigel Kneale became one of the best @-@ regarded screenwriters in the history of British television . In addition to the various Quatermass spin @-@ offs and sequels , he wrote acclaimed productions such as Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four ( 1954 ) and The Stone Tape ( 1972 ) . A tribute article by writer and admirer Mark Gatiss , published on the BBC News Online website shortly after Kneale 's death in 2006 , praised his contribution to British television history . " He is amongst the greats — he is absolutely as important as Dennis Potter , as David Mercer , as Alan Bleasdale , as Alan Bennett . " 
 Kneale 's actions were represented on screen in the final episode of The Quatermass Experiment . He manipulated the monster seen in Westminster Abbey at the climax , with his hands stuck through a photographic blow @-@ up of the interior of the Abbey . The monster actually consisted of gloves covered in various plant and other materials , prepared by Kneale and his girlfriend ( and future wife ) Judith Kerr . The couple kept the gloves as a memento , and still owned them fifty years later , when Kneale wore them again in a television documentary about his career . 
 Rudolph Cartier had emigrated from Germany in the 1930s to escape its Nazi regime , and joined the staff of the BBC the year before The Quatermass Experiment was made . He collaborated with Kneale on several further productions , and became a major figure in the British television industry . He directed important productions such as Kneale 's Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four adaptation , the two further BBC Quatermass serials , and one @-@ off plays such as Cross of Iron ( 1961 ) and Lee Oswald : Assassin ( 1966 ) . His 1994 obituary in The Times praised his contribution to 1950s television drama : " At a time when studio productions were usually as static as the conventional theatre , he was widely respected for a creative contribution to British television drama which gave it a new dimension . " The same piece also named The Quatermass Experiment as a high point in his career , calling the serial " a landmark in British television drama as much for its visual imagination as for its ability to shock and disturb . " 
 Quatermass was played by the experienced Reginald Tate , who had appeared in various films , including The Way Ahead ( 1944 ) . He died two years later , while preparing to take the role of the Professor again in Quatermass II . Tate was the second choice for the part ; Cartier had previously offered it to André Morell , who declined the role . ( Morell did later play Quatermass in the third instalment of the series , Quatermass and the Pit . ) Victor Carroon was played by Scottish actor Duncan Lamont , who later appeared in the film Mutiny on the Bounty ( 1962 ) , and as a different character in the film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit ( 1967 ) . He enjoyed working on The Quatermass Experiment so much that , although he was not required for the final episode , he went to Alexandra Palace to lend moral support . While there , he helped Kneale and Kerr to prepare their ' monster ' prop . 
 Appearing in a small role as a drunk was Wilfrid Brambell , who later appeared as a tramp in Quatermass II . Brambell , who also appeared in Cartier and Kneale 's production of Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four , later became widely known for his roles in the sitcom Steptoe and Son ( 1962 – 74 ) and the film A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 ) . The 74 @-@ year @-@ old actress Katie Johnson played a supporting part ; she later became well known and won a British Film Award for her role as the landlady Mrs. Louisa Wilberforce in the film The Ladykillers ( 1955 ) . 
 = = Reception and influence = = 
 The Quatermass Experiment achieved favourable viewing figures in 1953 , opening with an estimated audience of 3 @.@ 4 million for the first episode , increasing to 5 million for the sixth and final episode , and averaging 3 @.@ 9 million for the entire serial . The Times estimated that one year before The Quatermass Experiment was broadcast , in August 1952 , the total television audience consisted of about 4 million people . In March of that year , the BBC estimated that an average of 2 @.@ 25 million people watched BBC programmes each evening . 
 In 1954 Cecil McGivern , the Controller of Programmes at BBC Television , referred to the success of the serial in a memo discussing the impending launch of a new commercial television channel , ending the BBC 's monopoly . " Had competitive television been in existence then , we would have killed it every Saturday night while The Quatermass Experiment lasted . We are going to need many more ' Quatermass Experiment ' programmes . " Following Kneale 's death in 2006 , film historian Robert Simpson said that the serial had been " event television , emptying the streets and pubs for the six weeks of its duration . " When the digital television channel BBC Four remade the serial in 2005 , the channel 's controller , Janice Hadlow , described the original as " one the first ' must @-@ watch ' TV experiences that inspired the water cooler chat of its day " . 
 Viewers ' responses were generally positive . Letters praising the production were sent to the BBC 's listings magazine , the Radio Times , while the writer and producer were also applauded by readers of TV News magazine , which nominated them for one of the publication 's " TV Bouquet " awards . Looking back at The Quatermass Experiment in a 1981 article for The Times , journalist Geoffrey Wansell highlighted the finale : 
 " Westminster Abbey undoubtedly dominated television during the summer of 1953 but it was not just the Coronation of the Queen that sticks in my mind now . It is also the memory of Professor Bernard Quatermass grappling with the pulsating giant plant that threatened to destroy the world from its rooting place in the Abbey 's nave … The Quatermass Experiment frightened the life out of a vast new generation of television viewers whose sets had been acquired in order to watch the Coronation … Quatermass was one of the first series on British television to make life seem potentially terrifying . " 
 Subsequent audience research showed that technical problems interrupting the final episode 's broadcast had a negative impact on audiences ' views of the serial ; the audience felt that the climax had been spoiled . 
 Despite such problems — and the existence of only the first two episodes in the archives — The Quatermass Experiment continued to earn critical praise in the decades following its transmission . The British Film Institute 's " Screenonline " website describes the serial as " one of the most influential series of the 1950s " , adding that " with its originality , mass appeal and dynamism , The Quatermass Experiment became a landmark of science fiction and the cornerstone of the genre on British television . " The website of the Museum of Broadcast Communications praises the serial 's underlying themes as its most effective feature . " The Quatermass Experiment 's depiction of an Englishman 's transformation into an alienated monster dramatized a new range of gendered fears about Britain 's postwar and post @-@ colonial security . As a result , or perhaps simply because of Kneale and Cartier 's effective combination of science fiction and poignant melodrama , audiences were captivated . " The website also points to the programme 's influence on the British science @-@ fiction television productions that followed , claiming that " with [ The Quatermass Experiment ] began a British tradition of science fiction television which runs in various forms from Quatermass to A for Andromeda to Blake 's 7 , and from Doctor Who to Red Dwarf . " 
 Kneale disliked Doctor Who — the most successful of the British science @-@ fiction programmes — saying that it had stolen his ideas . An article for The Daily Telegraph in 2005 described Doctor Who as the " spiritual successor " to the Quatermass serials , and Mark Gatiss , a scriptwriter for Doctor Who , wrote of his admiration of Kneale in an article for The Guardian in 2006 . " Kneale wrote that [ 1953 ] was ' an over @-@ confident year ' and he piloted his hugely influential tale like a rocket into the drab schedules of Austerity Britain … What sci @-@ fi piece of the past 50 years doesn 't owe Kneale a huge debt ? " 
 In 2007 , Gatiss appeared as the character Professor Lazarus in the Doctor Who episode " The Lazarus Experiment " . The Radio Times noted in its preview of the episode that " Tonight 's story is an enjoyable synthesis of She , The Fly and The Quatermass Experiment — even down to the final battle in a London cathedral . "

 The popularity of The Quatermass Experiment gained the attention of the film industry , and Hammer Film Productions quickly purchased the rights to make an adaptation . It was released in 1955 , and starred the American actor Brian Donlevy , supported by the English actor Jack Warner , with Val Guest directing and co @-@ writing the screenplay . Nigel Kneale was unhappy with the result , and was especially displeased with the casting of Donlevy as Quatermass . He stated in an interview , " [ Donlevy ] was then really on the skids and didn 't care what he was doing . He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part . It was a case of take the money and run . Or in the case of Mr Donlevy , waddle . " The film was titled The Quatermass Xperiment to emphasise its X @-@ certificate status . In America the film was renamed The Creeping Unknown after the title Shock ! was considered for that territory , and an alternative opening title sequence with that name was prepared . 
 The BBC were also pleased with the success of The Quatermass Experiment and in 1955 a sequel , Quatermass II , was broadcast , with John Robinson in the title role following Tate 's death . This was followed in 1958 by Quatermass and the Pit , and both serials also had feature film versions made by Hammer . The character returned to television in a 1979 serial , simply titled Quatermass , for Thames Television . 
 A script book of The Quatermass Experiment , containing several production stills from the missing episodes , was published by Penguin Books in 1959 . To coincide with the broadcast of the Thames serial , it was republished in 1979 with a new introduction by Kneale . 
 In April 2005 , BBC Worldwide released a boxed set of all their Quatermass material on DVD , containing digitally restored versions of the two existing episodes of The Quatermass Experiment , the two subsequent BBC serials , and various extra material , including PDF files of photocopies of the original scripts for episodes three to six . However , the quality of these photocopies is in some cases quite poor . 
 On 2 April 2005 , the digital television channel BBC Four broadcast a live remake of the serial , abridged to a single special , also entitled The Quatermass Experiment . 
 = 1985 Puerto Rico floods = 
 The 1985 Puerto Rico floods produced the deadliest single landslide on record in North America , killing at least 130 people in the Mameyes neighborhood of barrio Portugués Urbano in Ponce . The floods were the result of a westward @-@ moving tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on September 29 . The system moved into the Caribbean Sea on October 5 and produced torrential rainfall across Puerto Rico , peaking at 31 @.@ 67 in ( 804 mm ) in Toro Negro State Forest . Two stations broke their 24 @-@ hour rainfall records set in 1899 . The rains caused severe flooding in the southern half of Puerto Rico , which isolated towns , washed out roads , and caused rivers to exceed their banks . In addition to the deadly landslide in Mameyes , the floods washed out a bridge in Santa Isabel that killed several people . The storm system caused about $ 125 million in damage and 180 deaths , which prompted a presidential disaster declaration . The tropical wave later spawned Tropical Storm Isabel . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The tropical wave that caused the flooding moved off the west coast of Africa on September 29 . Moving westward , the system entered the eastern Caribbean Sea on October 5 , although rainfall began spreading across Puerto Rico the day prior . The wave 's associated convection , or thunderstorms , were amplified by an upper @-@ level trough to its west . It was developing into a tropical cyclone while it moved across Puerto Rico . When the system 's rainbands reached the mountains of southern Puerto Rico , it produced torrential rainfall , and additional precipitation occurred owing to the system 's slow movement . 
 The most intense rainfall occurred on October 6 , and on that day two stations recorded 24 @-@ hour precipitation totals exceeding 23 in ( 580 mm ) . These totals broke the 24 @-@ hour rainfall records set during the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane , and amounted to nearly half of the annual precipitation totals . The town of Peñuelas reported very high rainfall totals in a short amount of time , including 2 @.@ 75 in ( 70 mm ) in one hour and 5 @.@ 5 in ( 140 mm ) in two hours . The highest rainfall total on Puerto Rico was 31 @.@ 67 in ( 804 mm ) in Toro Negro State Forest . Rainfall spread across the island , and the southern half of Puerto Rico experienced totals of over 10 in ( 250 mm ) . Rainfall totals over 7 in ( 180 mm ) spread across the United States Virgin Islands . The tropical wave later spawned a low pressure area north of Hispaniola that became Tropical Storm Isabel on October 7 , a day before the rains subsided in Puerto Rico . The storm ultimately struck Florida before dissipating on October 15 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Across Puerto Rico , heavy rains from the weather system caused river flooding and landslides . The rains most significantly affected the municipalities of Ponce , Juana Díaz , Santa Isabel , and Coamo . Several stations reported 100 year flooding , just five months after similar floods affected the island . The floods in May generally affected the northern portion of the island , and the October event generally affected southern Puerto Rico , although the town of Barceloneta experienced floods in both events . Several rivers exceeded their banks , and the Toa Vaca reservoir filled to its capacity for the second time since it was constructed in 1972 . 
 Saturated soils caused mudslides throughout Puerto Rico , although only one resulted in loss of life . In the hillside community of Mameyes , within Ponce , there was a block slide at around 3 : 00 am local time on October 7 . A large slab of sandstone detached from a hill , moving about 250 @,@ 000 cu yd ( 190 @,@ 000 m3 ) of material down the hill . The intense rainfall triggered the landslide , although pre @-@ existing conditions such as a leaking water main and poor sewage flow likely contributed to the event . The landslide destroyed about 90 houses , killing at least 130 people ; however , the death toll could have been as high as 300 . This made it the deadliest single landslide on record in North America . Many of the homes in Mameyes were poorly built with tin and wood materials , and some were built on stilts . Two landslides occurred near Peñuelas , collectively damaging or destroying 13 buildings . 
 A flooded creek in Quebrada del Agua , near Ponce , killed 16 people . Flooding washed away the westbound bridge over the Río Coamo near Santa Isabel along San Juan – Ponce highway . At least six cars drove into an unlit 35 ft ( 11 m ) gap in the road , killing 29 people . Four of the deaths were police officers who were trying to rescue a family from a car that was washed away . At least six bridges were washed out across the island . The floods left about 32 @,@ 000 people without power , and some towns were isolated . The floods shut down 11 water filtration plants and 13 sewage treatment plants , which left 16 municipalities temporarily without water . Across Puerto Rico , the floods damaged 1 @,@ 700 houses and destroyed another 1 @,@ 300 . About 50 @,@ 000 people had to leave their houses for shelter across Puerto Rico . Damage was estimated at $ 125 million ( 1985 USD ) , and throughout the territory , the floods killed 180 people , 150 of whom lived in Ponce . Officials considered the system to be the " worst disaster " on the island since Hurricane Donna in 1960 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On October 7 , Puerto Rican governor Rafael Hernández Colón declared an islandwide state of emergency and activated 300 National Guardsmen to assist in search and rescue operations . Governor Colón sought " technical advice " from Mexico , as the country had experienced a devastating earthquake two weeks prior . The United States Coast Guard flew helicopters into flooded areas to rescue stranded residents , including 18 people along a hill in the western portion of the island . About $ 10 million in emergency funds was allocated by the Puerto Rican legislature , of which $ 1 million was distributed among the most affected families with $ 300 checks . The American Red Cross deployed a team of 15 people to Puerto Rico , who specialized in damage assessment , health services , or other services . After the storm , the Puerto Rican government created a Rainfall @-@ Runoff Alert Network , designed to predict flash flooding in advance , in conjunction with the National Weather Service , the United States Geological Survey , and the territory 's Department of Natural Resources . 
 On October 10 , United States president Ronald Reagan declared 33 municipalities across Puerto Rico as disaster area . This allocated federal funding for assistance to individual families and public aid to repair public facilities . Federal Emergency Management Agency ultimately provided $ 63 million in aid to the territory . Puerto Ricans living in the United States raised money and collected donations for the residents on the island . 
 Governor Colón considered turning the Mameyes neighborhood into a common grave to prevent the spread of disease outbreak . As a result , the National Guard evacuated the town , although the governor changed his mind after public outcry . Initially , a death toll of 500 people was reported , although that was " the product of the original , collective hysteria , " according to the mayor of Ponce 's press officer . Additionally , the number of destroyed houses was overestimated , only to be revised downward owing to before @-@ and @-@ after satellite images and interviews with survivors . After the Mameyes landslide , about 150 people , including National Guardsmen , worked to locate bodies with the assistance of six rescue dogs . Rescue workers also recovered 23 bodies from the collapsed bridge near Coamo . On October 13 , officials halted the search for any survivors of the landslide , although workers continued to look for storm victims . On October 22 , Governor Colón ordered the teams to stop searching for bodies after officials determined that there was a threat of further landslides . Workers initially had difficulty assisting the affected families due to the occurrence in early morning and the continued intensity of the rain , and as a result , only 50 bodies were recovered . Many houses around the Mameyes landslide were later demolished as they were at risk for further landslides . 
 Governor Hernández Colón announced that a memorial would be created for the Mameyes victims at the site . Originally the memorial was known as " el Parque de la Recordación del Barrio Mameyes " , literally " Park of the Recollection of the Neighborhood Mameyes " in English . In 2011 , however , residents of Ponce successfully petitioned to change the name from a park to a memorial site . 
 = = Children drawings = = 
 Three days before the Mameyes landslide , a group of children from a nearby Head Start school were asked by their teacher to draw " whatever came to their minds " . Several of them made drawings that some people see as premonitions of the disaster . Several of the drawings featured crosses , and dark earth @-@ like colors . Some of the children died in the landslide . The drawings were handed by an unidentified teacher to Gladys Torres , administrator of public documents and Director of the Historic Archive of Ponce . They are exhibited in the Ponce Museum of History . 
 = Webster Sycamore = 
 The Webster Sycamore ( alternatively known as the Webster Springs Sycamore and the Big Sycamore Tree ) was an American sycamore ( Platanus occidentalis ) in the U.S. state of West Virginia . Long recognized for its size , the Webster Sycamore was the largest living American sycamore tree in West Virginia until its felling in 2010 . The tree stood approximately 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) east of Webster Springs in Webster County , in a moist flood plain along the banks of the Back Fork Elk River , a tributary stream of the Elk River . 
 The Webster Sycamore reached a tree height measurement of 112 feet ( 34 m ) , a tree crown measurement of 90 feet ( 27 m ) , and a circumference of 25 @.@ 75 feet ( 7 @.@ 85 m ) at breast height . In 1955 , the American Forests Association declared the tree the largest of its species in the United States . It only held the title for three weeks , before the association identified a larger American sycamore in Maryland . Despite losing its national title , the sycamore remained the largest American sycamore in West Virginia . Following a 1963 survey of large trees in West Virginia , the Webster Sycamore was named the second @-@ largest tree after a white oak ( Quercus alba ) in Randolph County . 
 The land upon which the Webster Sycamore was located was owned by the Purdee and Curtin Lumber Company , which spared the tree during its lumber operations in the area during the 1950s . West Virginia University biologist W. H. Gillespie averred that the tree stood as " a memorial of the original virgin forest " . The Purdee and Curtin Lumber Company preserved the land surrounding the tree as a park , known as Big Sycamore Park . During the annual events Webster Wildwater Weekend in April and the Webster County Nature Weekend in May , hiking excursions were led to the Webster Sycamore . 
 On September 3 , 2007 , a malicious fire was set in the base of the Webster Sycamore 's trunk . The tree survived the blaze , but suffered irreparable damage . The West Virginia Division of Forestry performed a safety and risk assessment of the tree , and determined that structural mitigation was not feasible , and that the Webster Sycamore was to be " considered an extreme hazard " . In January 2008 , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old suspect from <unk> was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree . Following the fire , experts recommended that the Webster Sycamore be felled or fenced off as a safety measure . According to the Division of Forestry , the tree was finally brought down during the summer of 2010 . At the time of its death , the tree was estimated to be over 500 years old . 
 = = Geography and setting = = 
 Prior to the arrival of European American settlers and explorers , the Allegheny Mountain Range of the Appalachian Mountains was overlaid with old @-@ growth forests consisting predominantly of deciduous hardwood trees , which were characterized by individual trees of enormous size and girth . The American sycamore ( Platanus occidentalis ) was one of the species of trees that proliferated throughout these old @-@ growth forests . American sycamores can grow at least 100 feet ( 30 m ) in height and the species is distributed throughout the Eastern United States . It usually thrives in moist soils along streams , especially in sandy loam soils . American sycamores are a dominant species in bottomland and riparian forests . The species is present throughout every county in West Virginia , and is most abundant along the state 's streams . 
 Formerly West Virginia 's largest American sycamore , the Webster Sycamore ( alternatively known as the Webster Springs Sycamore and the Big Sycamore Tree ) was located in a moist flood plain along the banks of the Back Fork Elk River , a tributary stream of the Elk River , in Webster County . The tree was located approximately 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) east of Webster Springs .

 = = = Dimensions and age = = = 
 Various measurements were taken of the tree during the latter part of its lifetime ; however , measurements of the circumference differ . In 1955 , the tree 's circumference at breast height , when measured 4 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) from the ground , was 24 feet 8 inches ( 7 @.@ 52 m ) . At a tree fork 45 feet ( 14 m ) from the ground , its trunk measured 4 @.@ 33 feet ( 1 @.@ 32 m ) in diameter . The trunk stood to a height of 82 feet ( 25 m ) , where it had been decapitated by a previous windstorm . The tree 's horizontal canopy spread measured approximately 75 feet ( 23 m ) in width . The lowest limb of the sycamore was 23 @.@ 5 feet ( 7 @.@ 2 m ) from the ground , and measured 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) in diameter . According to official measurements in 1963 , however , the diameter at breast height of the Webster Sycamore , when measured 4 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) from the ground , was more than 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) and its circumference measured 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) . The sycamore was estimated to be at least 120 feet ( 37 m ) in height . Its trunk measured approximately 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) in diameter when measured 90 feet ( 27 m ) from the forest floor . 
 According to the West Virginia Division of Forestry and West Virginia Humanities Council in 2002 and the West Virginia Big Tree Program in 2011 , the Webster Sycamore was the largest American sycamore in West Virginia , with a height of 112 feet ( 34 m ) , a tree crown measurement of 90 feet ( 27 m ) , and a circumference of 25 @.@ 75 feet ( 7 @.@ 85 m ) at breast height . 
 By the time of its felling in 2010 , the Webster Sycamore was estimated to be over 500 years in age .

 In 1955 , an eastern hemlock ( Tsuga canadensis ) measuring 5 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) in height grew from a rotten <unk> in the tree 's main south fork . By 1963 , the hemlock that had taken root in the tree 's south fork remained . In describing the growth of the hemlock from an upper tree fork of the Webster Sycamore , writer William C. Blizzard referenced the idiom of <unk> piled upon Ossa . No tree hollows or visible outer blemishes were reported on the sycamore at that time ; however , by 2007 , the tree 's trunk had developed an opening into its hollow center at its base , which allowed visitors to step inside of it .

 The Webster Sycamore had long been a local landmark on account of its age and size , and was known locally as being the world 's largest American sycamore . By 1920 , author Edwin Lincoln Mosely had included an image and a brief description of a similar American sycamore near Webster Springs – probably the Webster Sycamore – in his book Trees , Stars and Birds : A Book of Outdoor Science . 
 It was in 1955 that the tree won recognition from the American Forests Association as the largest tree of its species in the United States . It only held the title for three weeks before a larger American sycamore in Maryland was discovered and recognized by the association . Despite losing its national title , the sycamore remained the largest American sycamore in West Virginia . 
 During the West Virginia Centennial " big @-@ tree contest " of 1963 , the honorific of the state 's largest tree went to a white oak ( Quercus alba ) near <unk> in Randolph County , thus beating out the Webster Sycamore . The white oak measured 11 @.@ 25 feet ( 3 @.@ 43 m ) in diameter . An elm ( Ulmus ) tree in Putnam County also bested the Webster Sycamore at 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) in diameter . 
 During a speech to the United States Senate in honor of West Virginia Day on June 20 , 2004 , U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd mentioned the Webster Sycamore while boasting of " the biggest and best of West Virginia " .

 The land upon which the Webster Sycamore was located was owned by the Purdee and Curtin Lumber Company of nearby Webster Springs . The company spared the tree in the 1950s , during its lumber operations in the area . According to West Virginia University biologist W. H. Gillespie in Castanea , the tree stood as " a memorial of the original virgin forest " . The Purdee and Curtin Lumber Company preserved the land surrounding the tree as a park , known as Big Sycamore Park . The park was utilized by campers , and by tourists visiting the tree . A swinging bridge across the Back Fork of Elk River provided access to the tree and the park . 
 In 2002 , the Webster Sycamore was one of five trees nominated by the West Virginia Humanities Council to the National Register of Historic Trees , a registry of historic trees maintained by the American Forests Historic Tree Nursery . 
 During the annual events Webster Wildwater Weekend in April and the Webster County Nature Weekend in May , hiking excursions were led to the Webster Sycamore , in addition to the nearby Three Falls of Back Fork .

 On the afternoon of September 3 , 2007 , a malicious fire was set in the base of the Webster Sycamore 's trunk . The fire burned up through the hollow center of the tree 's hollow bole . The Webster Springs Fire Department , Webster County Sheriff 's Department , and the West Virginia Division of Forestry provided a joint response to the fire , and remained on the scene for several hours until the flames were out . The tree survived the blaze but suffered irreparable damage . 
 Initially following the fire , the tree 's vicinity was closed for the investigation and for an assessment of the extent of damage and safety risk . On September 27 , 2007 , the West Virginia Division of Forestry 's urban forestry coordinator Bob Hannah and technical specialist Jennifer Brashears engaged in an inspection and evaluation of the tree to provide recommendations . In their report , Hannah and Brashears assessed that the tree 's " severe structural weakness " was not caused by the fire , and instead highlighted the tree 's " size , age , and severity of defects " as the cause of its instability . They did , however , assess that the fire may have caused further mortality of the tree 's cambium . They used various measurements developed by the International Society of Arboriculture and the United States Forest Service to formulate a tree risk assessment . At the time of their investigation , the tree 's diameter at breast height was 8 @.@ 42 feet ( 2 @.@ 57 m ) , with 27 % of the trunk consisting of open space . Hannah and Brashears also found that one @-@ third of the lower trunk and root crown demonstrated callus formation and no new growth , but instead severe decay and peeling bark . Hannah and Brashears further determined that structural mitigation was not feasible , and that the Webster Sycamore was to be " considered an extreme hazard " and the public should be " excluded from its striking zone through fencing and signage " . 
 The investigation into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry 's chief investigator , Sam Butcher . The investigation lasted four months , and once a suspect had been identified , the case was turned over to the Webster County prosecuting attorney 's office . Butcher credited Art <unk> , a Division of Forestry investigator , for bringing the investigation to its conclusion . In January 2008 , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old suspect from <unk> was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree , while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing false information to investigators . The suspect was also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers , possession of marijuana , and underage consumption of alcohol . The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire . 
 Following the fire , experts recommended that the Webster Sycamore be felled or fenced off as a security measure . According to the Division of Forestry , the tree was finally brought down during the summer of 2010 . 
 In recognition of the tree , the Health Policy Division of the Office of the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner considered the name " Sycamore Healthcare Exchange " as one of the naming options for West Virginia 's health insurance marketplace in 2011 , following the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . 
 = Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus = 
 Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus , commonly known as the olive wax cap , is a species of fungus in the genus Hygrophorus . The fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) appear from midsummer to late autumn under conifers in North American and Eurasian mountain forests . The mushrooms have olive @-@ brown , slimy caps with dark streaks and a dark umbo ; the caps measure 3 to 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 4 @.@ 7 in ) in diameter . Other characteristic features include a slimy stem up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) long that is spotted with ragged scales up to a ring @-@ like zone . As its name implies , the mushroom has a waxy cap and gills . It is native to North America and across the northern regions of Europe . According to a publication by the Council of Europe , the fungus is nearly extinct in France . 
 Although Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus is edible , opinions are divided regarding its taste . Besides its usage as an edible mushroom , the fungus possesses antibiotic @-@ like compounds . 
 = = Taxonomy and classification = = 
 The species was first officially described as Agaricus olivaceoalbus by Elias Fries in 1815 . It had earlier been published as Agaricus adustus by August Johann Georg Karl Batsch in 1783 , but this was an illegitimate renaming of Agaricus brunneus published in 1774 by Jacob Christian Schäffer . It received its current scientific name when Fries transferred it to the genus Hygrophorus in 1838 . Paul Kummer moved the species to Limacium in 1871 , but this genus has since been sunk into synonymy with Hygrophorus . 
 Several varieties of H. olivaceoalbus have been proposed : 
 Together with H. pustulatus , H. persoonii , H. <unk> and H. <unk> , H. olivaceoalbus form the section <unk> within the genus Hygrophorus . The fungi of this section have greasy to slimy caps and stems . Their caps are darkish brown grey , olive or orange , and their stems are <unk> or somewhat distinctly ringed . 
 Common names that have been used for the mushroom include the " slimy @-@ sheathed waxy cap " , the " olive <unk> " , the " <unk> <unk> " and the " olive wax cap " . The specific epithet olivaceoalbus is derived from the Latin words for olive @-@ brown ( olivaceus ) and white ( albus ) . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Fruit body = = = 
 The cap of H. olivaceoalbus is 3 – 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) wide and is hemispherical in young fungi ; they become flatter and wider with age , but they keep their characteristic dark umbo . Underneath the slimy grey to sooty @-@ brown surface , the cap cuticle is streaked with fine , dark grey radially arranged fibers . Young fruit bodies are covered by two velum layers ; the inner velum , composed of dark fibrils , becomes a ring or sheath ( annular zone ) on the stem that is covered by the gelatinous outer layer . 
 The fruit body has a long stem ranging from 3 to 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 4 @.@ 7 in ) , a diameter of 1 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) and a somewhat slimy surface in wet weather . It is often wavy or bent . The base of the stem is sometimes slimmer than near its apex . Above the annular zone , the stem is smooth and whitish . It is covered by two layers of tissue : the exterior sticky layer , and the comparatively thin interior layer that consists of flaky fibres , similar to the those under the cap 's slime layer , with which they are initially linked . As the stem grows and increases in length , the interior layer becomes ripped , and breaks up into ragged dark concentric bands . The gills of H. olivaceoalbus are thick , widely spaced and adnate ( broadly attached ) to decurrent ( extending slightly down the stem ) ; they are white ( slightly greyish on the base ) , and have a waxy surface . 
 The flesh of the mushroom is smooth , thin and white . The taste and odor are mild and have no distinct smell . When treated with a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) or sulfuric acid , the flesh turns reddish . The spore print of H. olivaceoalbus is white . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 The spores are 9 – 12 × 5 – 6 µm , ellipsoid , and are not amyloid ; their surface is smooth . They are yellow in Melzer 's reagent . The basidia have dimension of 46 – 62 × 7 – 10 µm , and are <unk> with short , stubby sterigmata . They have neither pleurocystidia nor cheilocystidia . 
 The cap cuticle has a width of 250 to 450 µm and consists of <unk> , dark hyphae with a width from 2 to 3 µm , which form an ixocutis ( a horizontal layer of hyphae embedded in slime ) and possess clamp connections ; the fungus has no <unk> . The gill trama consists of hyphae about 3 to 8 µm thick ; the cap tissue comprises radial hyphae . 
 The mycorrhiza , formed from H. olivaceoalbus as a fungal partner , such as the <unk> gelatinosa , is white and has a smooth , waxy surface , with several layers of hyphae layered around the tree 's roots ; sometimes this mycorrhiza shows hypertrophy . The hyphae are covered with a <unk> mass that is secreted from the outer walls of the hyphae . The ectomycorrhizae can reach lengths of up to 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) and have few side branches ; many older ectomycorrhizae have a cavity at the tip that resembles a hole . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 H. olivaceoalbus shows similarities between other closely related fungi of the genus Hygrophorus , some of which have only minor differences in physical features . Examples include H. pustulatus , H. <unk> , H. <unk> or H. morrisii . In the field , H. olivaceoalbus is distinguished by a combination of features including the double velum , the dark streaks on the slimy cap , the <unk> of the stem , and growth under pines , as well as by microscopic characteristics . There is no risk of confusing it with toxic fungi . 
 Hygrophorus persoonii and H. olivaceoalbus produce different <unk> ( <unk> ) and their flesh react differently with the addition of NaOH ( red on H. olivaceoalbus versus olive green on H. persoonii ) . Furthermore , H. persoonii favours oaks as a mycorrhizal partner . The North American species H. <unk> produces a smaller fruit body with caps measuring 3 – 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) wide , and dry stems that measure 3 – 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) long by 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 20 – 0 @.@ 47 in ) thick . 
 = = Ecology and distribution = = 
 Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus creates mycorrhizae with conifers . In the West Coast of the United States , associations are most common with Sitka spruces and giant redwoods . In the Rocky Mountains it associates with Engelmann spruce and blue spruce , and in northeast North America with hemlocks . It usually favours acidic and chalky ground with mosses in higher altitudes as well as conifer forests and occasionally mixed forests . The fruit bodies are often found singly , but may also grow in clusters . 
 The range of H. olivaceoalbus stretches across the northern and western North America as well as across Europe ( except the Mediterranean region ) and Russia . The fungus typically fruits between late summer and early winter , and occasionally ( depending on the geographical location and climate ) as early as June or right through December . The population is currently not endangered , except in France , where it is almost extinct .

 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus finds a use especially in the kitchen , but the indistinct taste of the fruit bodies have received a mixed reception overall . Kate Mitchel considers the waxy surface " unappetizing " , while David Arora described the taste as " bland and slimy " . Some authors suggest removing the cap cuticle before eating . Overall , several authors call the mushroom edible , but caution is still required , as " not everyone can eat them " . The popularity of this fungus varies from one region to another . It is more commonly consumed in Europe than in North America , and is differently coveted within Europe . For example , in Spain the fungi is more highly appreciated in Catalonia ; mushroom dishes in this region are more common than in the rest of Spain .

 <unk> of <unk> , the so @-@ called hygrophorones , can be obtained from the fruit body of H. olivaceoalbus ; the fungus produces them as secondary metabolites . The detected compounds are polyols and have an antifungal and antibacterial effect , especially in connection with Gram @-@ positive bacteria . H. olivaceoalbus is therefore an important source of antibiotics , especially as the hygrophorones also show an effect on bacterial cultures that are resistant against contemporary antibiotics such as methicillin , ciprofloxacin or vancomycin . The fungus has been used in Traditional Chinese medicine , where it is known for its curing components , such as 4- , 6- or 4 @,@ 5 @,@ 6 @-@ tri @-@ O @-@ acetyl hygrophorones <unk> . 
 = 200 ( South Park ) = 
 " 200 " is the fifth episode of the fourteenth season of the American animated television series South Park , and the 200th overall episode of the series . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14 , 2010 . In the episode , Tom Cruise and all other celebrities who have been mocked by residents of South Park in the past plan to file a class action lawsuit against the town , but Cruise promises to end the lawsuit if the town can get the Muslim prophet Muhammad to meet him . 
 The episode was written and directed by series co @-@ creator Trey Parker . To celebrate their landmark episode , Parker and fellow series co @-@ creator Matt Stone combined many of South Park 's past storylines and controversies . The Muhammad subplot , similar to the one previously featured in the season 10 episode " Cartoon Wars " , refers to Comedy Central 's past refusal to allow images of Muhammad to be shown on the network in response to the riots and threats generated from controversial cartoons in 2005 and 2007 of Muhammad in European newspapers . 
 " 200 " includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes , including Cruise , Rob Reiner , Steven Spielberg , Kanye West , Paris Hilton , George Lucas , Mel Gibson and Barbra Streisand . An additional subplot includes Cartman learning he may not know the true identity of his father . The 1998 season 2 episode " Cartman 's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut " claimed that Cartman 's hermaphrodite mother is his father , but the events of " 200 " and the subsequent episode reveal that this is not the case . 
 " 200 " received mostly positive reviews . According to Nielsen Media Research , the episode was seen by 3 @.@ 33 million viewers , making it the most watched cable television program of the night . Both " 200 " and the sequel episode " 201 " were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010 . Within a week of the episode 's original broadcast date , the website for the radical Muslim organization Revolution Muslim posted an entry warning Parker and Stone that they risked being murdered for airing the episode , which several media outlets and observers interpreted as a threat . As a result , Comedy Central heavily censored portions of " 201 " by removing references to Muhammad and the episode 's closing speech . 
 = = Plot = = 
 While on a school field trip to a candy factory , Butters spots actor Tom Cruise working there , packing fudge into boxes . Stan , who previously told Cruise that his acting is not as good as others ' in " Trapped in the Closet " , accidentally insults him again by calling him a " fudge packer " , as Cruise claims to be fly fishing . Cruise then recruits 200 other celebrities who have been ridiculed by the town of South Park to bring a class action lawsuit against the town . Stan returns to the factory with his father Randy to try to apologize and convince Cruise to drop the suit , but also finds it difficult not to call him a fudge packer as well since he was literally packing fudge while they spoke . An angry Cruise agrees to do so , but only if they can help Cruise meet Muhammad . This causes an uproar because depictions of Muhammad are forbidden , and the townsfolk fear that forcing Muhammad to appear in public will drive Muslim radicals to bomb the town . Stan and Kyle go to the Super Best Friends , a squad of superhero @-@ like religious figures of which Muhammad is a member , to request he return with them to South Park . Meanwhile , it is revealed that Cruise and the other celebrities only want Muhammad for his " goo " , as Rob Reiner , previously shown to be filled with " goo " in " Butt Out " , has invented a machine to transfer Muhammad 's " goo " to the celebrities , which they believe will make them immune to ridicule , just like Muhammad . 
 By this time , Cartman arrives with " Mitch Connor " , a face painted on Cartman 's hand as one @-@ half of a ventriloquist act . Previously , Connor had successfully impersonated actress Jennifer Lopez in " Fat Butt and Pancake Head " , and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation in order to get involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities . Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad 's goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer . Meanwhile , Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town , but only if he stays in the back of a U @-@ Haul truck and is not seen . When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise 's limo , they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit . South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by the Ginger Kids , a group of fair @-@ skinned , red @-@ haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance . The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves , hoping to use his goo for their own means . They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them . 
 The people of South Park decide to turn Muhammad over to the Gingers , fearing the violence that will befall their town if they do not . The celebrities are angered by this change in events , but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers . Instead , the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt Mecha @-@ Streisand , a giant mechanical monster form of Barbra Streisand , who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed . The celebrities hope to use Mecha @-@ Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands . Meanwhile , due to the chain of events , Cartman decides Connor 's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit , but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father . Although they previously claimed his hermaphroditic mother was also his father , Connor insists this is a lie . Cartman confronts his school teacher Mr. Garrison and Garrison 's old hand puppet Mr. Hat , who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover @-@ up . Mecha @-@ Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends .

 Written and directed by series co @-@ founder Trey Parker , " 200 " was rated TV @-@ MA L in the United States . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14 , 2010 . It was the 200th episode of the series . Parker and fellow co @-@ creator Matt Stone conceive , write and produce most South Park episodes within a week of their broadcast date in order to maintain a sense of energy and timeliness . The idea for " 200 " , however , was conceived before the fourteenth season began in March 2010 , and before any of the season fourteen episodes that preceded it were conceived . While trying to decide how to celebrate the 200th episode , Parker and Stone started reviewing the plots and controversies of previous episodes , many of which had a common thread of mocking a particular celebrity . This led to the idea of the having all the celebrities band together in a class action lawsuit against the town . Parker said their reactions mirrored the real @-@ life reactions some of the celebrities had to their portrayals , adding , " If they could join forces , they probably would . " 
 Stone said in writing the episode , they were determined not to produce a clip show , but to merge all of the old ideas into a new , original script . The process proved challenging for the duo because it involved incorporating many ideas , subplots and characters into a single episode . Parker and Stone included a joke about this process at the start of the episode , when Cartman and Kyle are fighting with each other , and Stan accuses them of just " rehashing a bunch of old stuff " . In honor of the 200th episode , the website <unk> was launched , offering a forum to fans to post their congratulations to South Park and view those posted by others . Several notable names have contributed to the site , including the creators of the animated series The Simpsons ( who used the opportunity to revisit another previous South Park theme , the episode " Simpsons Already Did It " , saying " We already [ produced 200 episodes ] . Twice . " ) , members of the rock band Rush and Denver Nuggets basketball player Chauncey Billups . The site also includes congratulations from All in the Family creator Norman Lear , who guest @-@ starred in the 100th episode " I 'm a Little Bit Country " , and figure skater Brian Boitano , who was featured in the song " What Would Brian Boitano Do ? " in the 1999 film South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut . 
 = = Theme = = 
 = = = Muhammad subplot = = = 
 " 200 " features jokes and references to past South Park episodes , storylines , characters and controversies . The episode revolves heavily around efforts to bring Muhammad into public view . This is based on two past controversies in 2005 ( Jyllands @-@ Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy ) and 2007 ( Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy ) , when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad , which was responded to with reactions of violent riots , global protests and death threats toward the artists . As a result of those incidents , many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad whatsoever , which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise 's efforts to harvest Muhammad 's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule . Parker and Stone addressed the Muhammad issue in their two @-@ part tenth season episode " Cartoon Wars " , during which they attempt to show an image of the prophet , only to reveal that Comedy Central has forbidden any such image from being broadcast on their network . However , Muhammad had already been featured on @-@ screen in the fifth season episode " Super Best Friends " , in which he is among a band of religious figures modeled after the superheroes in the Super Friends cartoons from the 1970s and 1980s . ( The Super Best Friends are featured once again in " 200 " . ) The episode " Super Best Friends " aired in 2001 , before the Jyllands @-@ Posten and Vilks controversies . Stan makes reference to that past use of Muhammad 's image in " 200 " by saying of Muhammad , " I saw him once ... a while ago ... " This reference was purposely included to reflect the irony that an image that was previously not a problem had suddenly become an issue due to new circumstances . Stone said , " Something that was OK is now not OK , and that 's just fucked up . " The " Super Best Friends " episode continues to be run uncensored by Comedy Central in repeats , even though new images of Muhammad remained prohibited . 
 Additionally , Muhammad has long been featured as one of the many characters shown in an image of dozens of South Park residents during the show 's opening credits . That image , however , has gone largely unnoticed , and thus has not drawn much controversy . When asked whether they feared retribution for mocking Muhammad , Parker said , " We 'd be so hypocritical against our own thoughts , if we said , ' Okay , well let 's not make fun of them because they might hurt us . Okay , we 'll rip on the Catholics because they won 't hurt us , but we won 't rip on [ Muslims ] because they might hurt us . ' " The Muhammad subplot in " 200 " , like the " Cartoon Wars " episodes , advocates for free speech and speaks out against censorship , both of Muhammad 's image and any subject considered taboo . " 200 " also demonstrates the double standard in the handling of offensive images of Muhammad and other religious figures , particularly in the scene in which Muhammad is censored altogether , but Buddhism founder Gautama Buddha is shown snorting cocaine in front of the South Park children . The extreme measures the South Park boys go to in order to conceal Muhammad , like hiding him in a window @-@ less truck and dressing him as a mascot , demonstrate the absurdity of the fear in showing the prophet , as does the fear of retaliation that the South Park residents show after Randy draws a stick figure @-@ like drawing of him , which is not censored .

 " 200 " includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes . One of the most prominently parodied is Tom Cruise , who was the center of the ninth season episode " Trapped in the Closet " . Cruise spent much of that episode hiding in a closet , a reference to rumors of his homosexuality . In " 200 " , he is found working in a fudge factory as a " fudge packer " , another reference to alleged homosexuality . The episode also reveals Cruise 's house consists mostly of closets , a reference to both homosexuality and the original episode in which Cruise was mocked .

 Near the end of " 200 " , the celebrities seek assistance from singer and actress Barbra Streisand , who resembles a giant two @-@ legged mechanical monster . This is a reference to Streisand 's appearance in the first season episode " Mecha @-@ Streisand " , in which she transforms into a monster in the style of Mechagodzilla from the Godzilla franchise . The Mecha @-@ Streisand featured in " 200 " is designed with more sophisticated computer imagery than the original , which was a simple cut @-@ out style cartoon like the rest of South Park . Although Parker and Stone have maintained that most of the celebrities they mock in South Park are chosen at random , with no personal animosity behind it , Barbra Streisand is one of the few they actively and vehemently dislike . Streisand , in turn , has been critical of South Park and her portrayal in it , and has accused the show of adding " to the cynicism and negativity in our culture , especially in children " . 
 = = = Cartman 's father = = = 
 The episode ends with a cliffhanger involving Cartman 's father . The identity of Cartman 's father made up a major plot point at the end of the first season , culminating in the second season episode " Cartman 's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut " , in which it is revealed Cartman 's mother , Liane Cartman , is a hermaphrodite and , in fact , is Cartman 's father . " 200 " is the first episode to return to the matter and suggest this was not the actual truth . Throughout the episode , Cartman uses a hand @-@ puppet con @-@ artist named Mitch Connor , who had , presumably , just been made up by Cartman in trying to fool Kyle in the seventh season episode " Fat Butt and Pancake Head " , resuming his role in pretending to be Jennifer Lopez and utilizing many offensive Hispanic stereotypes in his portrayal of her . The hand puppet portrayal is very similar to the work of Spanish ventriloquist Señor <unk> . 
 Several other references to previous South Park episodes are featured throughout " 200 " . It marks the reappearance of Mr. Hat , a hand puppet that had been frequently used by Mr. Garrison during the early South Park seasons , but had long been abandoned in later episodes . During the second half of " 200 " , an army of red @-@ haired " ginger kids " attempt to capture Muhammad themselves . Several South Park episodes , most prominently the ninth season episode " Ginger Kids " , have featured the ginger kids , which are children with fair skin , freckles and red hair . In most cases , they have been made the subject of ridicule by Cartman , who views them in an offensively stereotypical way . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 During one scene , a frustrated Tom Cruise angrily jumps up and down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him . This is a reference to incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005 , in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah , fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes . Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior . In another scene , George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed , chained and ball @-@ gagged , as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films . This is a reference to the twelfth season episode " The China Probrem " , in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly , which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg / Lucas film , Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode , despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show . In the episode , Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice , and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should " just have sex with him [ Johnny Depp ] already " . Cartman 's Jennifer Lopez hand @-@ puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell , particularly <unk> , which is one of the many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character . Also , when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed , Barbra Streisand is referenced as " her , " to which the discussion goes " her who ? " " her " " oh ... her . " This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey , who the dentist had physically abused , where Steve asks " what did I ever do to you " and Rick answers " it wasn 't what you did to me , it was what you did to her " Steve : " her ? oh ... her "

 The episode received mostly positive reviews . Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said he was surprised by the complexity of " 200 " and the amount of South Park references and subplots it encompassed , especially the questions over Cartman 's father . Tucker praised the episode , and said , " With jokes raining down like hell @-@ fire , the 200th episode spared no one except the South Park kids themselves . " Ramsey Isler of IGN said it was fun to identify all the references to past South Park moments , but felt " 200 " itself didn 't stand out as a great episode . Isler said the new material wasn 't very funny , and that the rehashed material was not as funny as the first time they were shown , which was disappointing due to the hype surrounding the episode . The A.V. Club writer Sean O 'Neal said the episode was funny , but that the original material was far outnumbered by rehashed jokes . O 'Neal said the use of all the celebrities demonstrated how South Park had been more original in early episodes , but now had " morph [ ed ] into something whose default mode is mocking famous people in the news " . 
 Douglas Murray of The Daily Telegraph said of the episode , " I can 't recommend it enough " , and particularly complimented the episode scenes with Buddha snorting cocaine and the South Park townspeople hiding Muhammad . Murray said , " They make the point about the absurd self @-@ censorship and thuggish intimidation surrounding the Islamic faith better than anything else I 've seen . " Amy Duncan of Metro said it " certainly was an episode to remember " . Duncan praised the story , which she said " develops with [ South Park 's ] usual rude inferences and below @-@ the @-@ belt remarks " . Ryan Broderick of The Hofstra Chronicle said the episode " came together so simply , so smoothly , and so hilariously that it forgives the last couple lame duck episodes of the season " . Broderick said it avoided the pitfalls of most landmark episodes by providing an original story in addition to the throwback references . Nick Zaino of TV Squad said the episode did not offer much new , but also offer good throwbacks and celebrity spoofs , and didn 't " pull any punches " . Zaino said the episode has " a wonderful sense of the absurd " , particularly through the use of Mecha @-@ Streisand and Cartman 's hand @-@ puppet . 
 The Council on American @-@ Islamic Relations , a Washington , D.C.-based civil rights and advocacy group , said they were aware of the depiction of Muhammad in " 200 " , but declined to put out a formal statement about it because they did not want to draw any more attention to the show .

It said that they " will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show . " Filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered by an Islamist in 2004 for making a short documentary on the violence against women in some Islamic societies . The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles . The author of the post , Zachary Adam Chesser ( who prefers to be called Abu Talhah al Amrikee ) , said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone , not a threat , and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest . 
 The entry included audio clips of a sermon by al @-@ Qaeda imam Anwar al @-@ Awlaki , calling for the assassination of anyone who has defamed Muhammad , saying , " <unk> Allah and his messenger is a reason to encourage Muslims to kill whoever does that . " It also included a link to a 2009 Huffington Post article that gave details of Stone and Parker 's mansion in Colorado , and images of Ayaan Hirsi Ali , an activist writer and critic of Islam , who lives in permanent security protection because of threats . Comedy Central declined to comment on the post . Before writing the Revolution Muslim post , Chesser wrote an April 15 entry on his Twitter page : " May Allah kill Matt Stone and Trey Parker and burn them in Hell for all eternity . They insult our prophets Muhammad , Jesus , and Moses . " Chesser was subsequently sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for this and other offenses . 
 Despite Chesser 's statements that the website entry was a warning , several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat . Ayaan Hirsi Ali dismissed claims that the website entry was just a warning , calling it " an assault on the freedom of expression " that should not be marginalized or overlooked . She said of the episode , " The ' South Park ' episode of last weekend was not just funny , and it wasn 't just witty . [ It ] addressed an essential piece in the times that we are living . There is one group of people , one religion [ , ] that is claiming to be above criticism . " New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said he was aware of the website posting , but said , " We don 't think that this threat , as [ it ] is currently assessed , rises to a crime right now . " 
 CNN journalist Anderson Cooper said of the episode , " You might not like South Park the cartoon . You might think it 's offensive . [ But ] the notion that some radical Islamic group in America would make a threat , even a veiled one , against two men 's lives because of it is chilling . " Fox News commentator Bill O 'Reilly said he would have advised Parker and Stone not to do the episode out of fear of retaliation : " On the one hand you do have to admire their courage . But I don 't know whether the risk – reward [ ratio ] is worth it . " The Daily Telegraph writer Douglas Murray said the entry only gave " 200 " more legitimacy , writing , " [ It ] of course just confirms the point that the South Park boys were making . [ ... ] I 'd have said that was point proved . South Park 1 : Islamists 0 . " On the April 22 , 2010 , episode of Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , host Jon Stewart went into a ten @-@ minute tirade about the alleged death threats , expressing disgust at the alleged hypocrisy of Revolution Muslim 's speech while its members enjoy the American lifestyle and freedom of speech . 
 In response to the Revolution Muslim post , the South Park episode " 201 " , which aired the following week and concluded the unresolved storylines from " 200 " , was heavily censored by Comedy Central . The channel inserted audio bleeps over all references to Muhammad 's name and other portions of dialogue , including the entirety of the ending speech by the show 's main characters . 
 The Dutch version of Comedy Central began airing commercials for " 200 " during the week of April 26 , with the show scheduled to air on April 30 . However , " The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs " was shown instead . When asked about this , a spokesperson for Comedy Central Netherlands said they had reluctantly decided the episode to be pulled , along with the episode " 201 " . Neither episode is available on the Dutch South Park Studios website ; the same applies to the German website as of May 9 , 2010 . The Swedish affiliate of Comedy Central also refused to broadcast " 200 " and " 201 " in Sweden : 
 Comedy Central has decided not to air these two episodes of South Park . It is a decision we 've made with great reluctance . Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression ; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely , we all benefit . However , the safety of our employees is our unquestioned number [ - ] one priority , and therefore we have decided to take these precautionary measures .

 On May 1 , 18 days after the episode 's original airdate , a failed car bomb attempt was discovered by the New York City Police Department near the eastern corner of 1 Astor Plaza in New York City , on West 45 Street , on a side street near the location of the world headquarters of Viacom , Comedy Central 's parent company . Some news outlets reported that police are looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone , although no such link has yet been established . Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman Peter T. King , who described as one possible motive " the whole issue with ' South Park , ' which Islamic terrorists were threatening to have retribution for . " However , King stressed the theory was " one possibility out of a hundred " . Revolution Muslim has denied any involvement with the incident . <unk> Abdullah Muhammed , who runs the group 's website , was in Times Square at the time speaking out against President Barack Obama with a loudspeaker . But he said of the failed car bomb , " What do you think , I commanded somebody to blow up a building in the middle of Times Square ? [ ... ] It had nothing to do with the ' South Park ' controversy . It was not an attack targeting Viacom . " NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of the theory , " We certainly wouldn 't rule that out . " However , media reports indicated Faisal Shahzad , the suspect arrested in connection with the attempted bombing , had trained for months prior to the first broadcast of " 200 . "

 The day after the episode aired , the episode was available for streaming on the site . After a week , like the other Muhammad episodes , it was taken off due to copyright reasons . However , the message presented to the user for this episode is " We apologize that South Park Studios cannot stream this episode . " The sequel episode , " 201 " , also has not been made available for streaming , but a different message describes an intent to potentially post that episode . Similarly the episode and its sequel are not available to stream or buy on services Netflix , iTunes , Hulu , or Amazon on Demand . Furthermore , digital copies of these episodes that were purchased prior to their ban from digital distribution are no longer available for streaming or download .

 Although " 200 " was not currently available on the internet legally , and had not re @-@ aired since April 2010 , it was confirmed on February 11 , 2011 that " 200 " will be released on DVD . " 200 " along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park 's fourteenth season , was released on a three @-@ disc DVD set and two @-@ disc Blu @-@ ray set in the United States on April 26 , 2011 . 
 The version presented on the DVD and Blu @-@ ray is the uncensored version , with Muhammad 's name <unk> , unlike the episode that follows , " 201 " , which is presented on disc in its original network censored version . During the commentary in both " 200 " and " 201 " Parker and Stone never mention Muhammad directly , referring to him only as " the prophet of the Muslim faith " . Despite the package claiming otherwise , both " 200 " and " 201 " were completely omitted from the Region 4 and Region 2 releases . 
 = New Jersey Route 24 = 
 Route 24 is a state highway in New Jersey , United States , that extends 10 @.@ 42 mi ( 16 @.@ 77 km ) from a junction with Interstate 287 in Hanover Township in Morris County , passing southeast through Essex County , and ends at a junction with Interstate 78 in Springfield Township in Union County . The route is a four- to six @-@ lane freeway its entire length . 
 The route was created in 1927 to run from Phillipsburg to Newark , replacing pre @-@ 1927 Route 12 from Phillipsburg to Penwell and Pre @-@ 1927 Route 5 from Morristown to Newark . The route was extended west to the new Easton – Phillipsburg Toll Bridge in 1938 but was cut back to U.S. Route 22 in the eastern part of Phillipsburg in 1953 . The western terminus was cut back further around 1970 to Hackettstown with the route west of there becoming part of Route 57 . The freeway alignment of Route 24 between the John F. Kennedy Parkway and Interstate 78 was completed in 1972 . 
 With the completion of this freeway , Route 24 east of the John F. Kennedy Parkway became Route 124 . The freeway was completed between the abandoned Tri @-@ Borough Road interchange and the JFK Parkway in the 1970s but was not opened until 1992 , when the rest of the freeway to Interstate 287 was completed after years of legal , environmental and budgetary problems . At this time , the alignment of Route 24 between U.S. Route 202 in Morristown and the JFK Parkway became a western extension of Route 124 while the route was officially eliminated between Hackettstown and Morristown as it followed county @-@ maintained routes . The former route between Hackettstown and Morristown is still referred to as Route 24 by many and is still signed as such due to local outcry .

 Route 24 begins at an interchange with Interstate 287 in Hanover Township , Morris County , heading southeast on a six @-@ lane freeway . The route interchanges with County Route 511 ( Whippany Road ) with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance and crosses into Morris Township . Route 24 crosses back into Hanover Township , where it passes over County Route 623 ( Park Avenue ) and narrows to four lanes , and intersects County Route 510 ( Columbia Turnpike ) at a cloverleaf interchange near the Morristown Municipal Airport . Just past this interchange , the freeway crosses into Florham Park , heading southeast and passing through Madison before crossing back into Florham Park . Route 24 passes under Tri @-@ Borough Road and enters Chatham Borough . An abandoned cloverleaf interchange exists at this location , as Tri @-@ Borough Road was to be an extension of the Eisenhower Parkway . 
 = = = Essex and Union Counties = = = 
 Route 24 crosses into Millburn Township , Essex County , widens to six lanes , and passes over the Passaic River . In Millburn Township , the route interchanges with Route 124 , County Route 649 ( John F. Kennedy Parkway ) , and River Road . This interchange provides access to The Mall at Short Hills . Past this interchange , Route 124 becomes a frontage road for the Route 24 freeway and the freeway forms the border between the city of Summit in Union County and Millburn Township and interchanges with County Route 657 ( Summit Avenue ) . Route 24 continues along the Summit @-@ Millburn border until it fully enters Millburn and intersects County Route 608 ( Hobart Avenue ) with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance . Past this interchange , the Route 124 frontage road ends , with Route 124 following the freeway closely to the north as a two @-@ way road , and Route 24 crosses into Summit . The freeway interchanges with County Route 512 ( Broad Street ) with a westbound exit and entrance and eastbound exit and County Route 527 ( Morris Avenue ) with an eastbound exit and entrance , entering Springfield Township . Route 24 continues southeast toward its terminus at an interchange with Interstate 78 . 
 = = History = = 
 Route 24 was created in 1927 to run from downtown Phillipsburg at the Northampton Street Bridge over the Delaware River east to Route 25 ( now U.S. Route 1 / 9 ) in Newark , replacing Pre @-@ 1927 Route 12 from Phillipsburg to Penwell and Pre @-@ 1927 Route 5 from Morristown to Newark , along with a new proposed alignment between Penwell and Morristown . Two spurs of Route 24 numbered Route S24 were created in 1927 , both of which were renumbered in the 1953 renumbering . The western Route S24 ran northeast from Penwell to Hackettstown , and is now mostly Route 57 . The eastern Route S24 ran from Springfield to Elizabeth , and is now mostly Route 82 . In addition , Route 24N was a planning number for the approach to the new Delaware River crossing ( the Easton – Phillipsburg Toll Bridge ) in Phillipsburg that opened in 1938 . However , before the bridge opened , Route 24N was instead built simply as an extension of Route 24 . Between 1938 and 1941 , this segment was also designated as part of a rerouted U.S. Route 22 . In the 1953 renumbering , Route 24 ’ s western terminus was cut back to U.S. Route 22 in eastern Phillipsburg ( removing the concurrency in that town ) and the incomplete section of Route 24 between Penwell and Long Valley was bridged by signing the route along the former Route S24 and County Route 517 . Around 1970 , Route 24 west of Hackettstown became part of Route 57 . 
 Plans for the Route 24 freeway go back to 1950 when a bypass of the many congested towns along the route was planned ; this bypass was designated as a freeway in 1952 . In 1959 the freeway was planned on its current alignment , running from Interstate 287 near Morristown to Interstate 78 in Springfield Township , with approval in 1960 . In 1962 , plans were made to extend the Route 24 freeway west to U.S. Route 22 in Phillipsburg . In the 1970s , this western extension was cut back to U.S. Route 206 in Chester . It was put on hold in 1982 , largely because its route was planned through protected wetlands and forests . In 1970 , the Route 24 freeway was planned to become part of a western extension of Interstate 278 , which would have run northwest from its current terminus at U.S. Route 1 / 9 in Linden to Interstate 78 , which it would have followed west for a mile to the Route 24 freeway . However , this proposal was rejected by the Federal Highway Administration . 
 Construction on the section of the Route 24 freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Essex / Morris County border and Interstate 78 began in 1967 and was finished in 1972 . With the completion of this section , the former alignment of Route 24 between the John F. Kennedy Parkway and the boundary between Maplewood and Irvington , including frontage roads built alongside a portion of the freeway in the Short Hills area , was designated as Route 124 . The section across Chatham Borough from the John F. Kennedy Parkway to shortly past the still @-@ existing unused cloverleaf interchange at the Florham Park borough line , once signed as the Tri @-@ Borough Road , a never @-@ built southern extension of the Eisenhower Parkway , was built in 1973 @-@ 74 but not opened as it did not provide any connections to existing roads . Plans were made to finish the rest of the freeway to Interstate 287 ; however construction was halted for many years due to legal , environmental and budgetary problems . Construction finally began on this portion of freeway in 1988 . Route 24 was finally completed through to the intersection with Interstate 287 in Hanover Township on November 17 , 1992 , and at that time the Route 24 designation was limited to strictly that freeway . 
 Following the completion of the freeway , the former signed route of Route 24 between the junction with U.S. Route 202 in Morristown and the John F. Kennedy Parkway became a western extension of Route 124 . The western portion between Route 57 and Route 182 in Hackettstown and U.S. Route 202 officially had the Route 24 designation removed as the road has always been county @-@ maintained rather than state @-@ maintained . The New Jersey Department of Transportation has tried to remove signs from this section , but locals protested because they know it as Route 24 . Along this route , the road is known as County Route 517 from the Morris County / Warren County border to the Long Valley section of Washington Township , County Route 513 from Long Valley to Chester Borough , and County Route 510 from Chester Borough to Morristown . This route is also known as Old Route 24 along with its names and county route numbers .

 = Forestry in the United Kingdom = 
 Forestry is the management of trees and forests for environmental or economic gain . The United Kingdom , being in the British Isles , is ideal for tree growth , thanks to its mild winters , plentiful rainfall , fertile soil and hill @-@ sheltered topography . Growth rates for broadleaved ( hardwood ) trees exceed those of mainland Europe , while conifer ( softwood ) growth rates are three times those of Sweden and five times those of Finland . In the absence of people , much of Great Britain would be covered with mature oaks , except for Scotland . Although conditions for forestry are good , trees do face damage threats arising from fungi , parasites and pests . 
 Nowadays , about 12 @.@ 9 % of Britain 's land surface is wooded and this area is increasing . The country 's supply of timber was severely depleted during the First and Second World Wars , when imports were difficult , and the forested area bottomed out at under 5 % of Britain 's land surface in 1919 . That year , the Forestry Commission was established to produce a strategic reserve of timber . However , the recovery is still very much in progress . Other European countries average from 25 % to 37 % of their area as woodland . 
 Of the 31 @,@ 380 square kilometres ( 12 @,@ 120 sq mi ) of forest in Britain , around 30 % is publicly owned and 70 % is in the private sector . More than 40 @,@ 000 people work on this land . <unk> account for 29 % of Britain 's woodlands , the rest being conifers , but considering only England , the figures are 55 % broadleaf and 45 % conifer . Britain 's native tree flora comprises 32 species , of which 29 are <unk> . Britain 's industry and populace uses at least 50 million tonnes of timber a year . More than 75 % of this is softwood , and Britain 's forests cannot supply the demand ; in fact , less than 10 % of the timber used in Britain is home @-@ grown . Paper and paper products make up more than half the wood consumed in Britain by volume . 
 In October 2010 , the new coalition government of the UK suggested it might sell off around half the Forestry Commission @-@ owned woodland in the UK . A wide variety of groups were vocal about their disapproval , and by February 2011 , the government abandoned the idea . Instead , it set up the Independent Panel on Forestry led by Rt Rev James Jones , then the Bishop of Liverpool . This body published its report in July 2012 . Among other suggestions , it recommended that the forested portion of England should rise to 15 % of the country 's land area by 2060 . 
 = = History = = 
 Throughout most of British history , the trend has been to create farmland at the expense of forest . Furthermore , variations in the Holocene climate have led to significant changes in the ranges of many species . This makes it complex to estimate the likely extent of natural forest cover . For example , in Scotland four main areas have been identified : oak dominated forest south of the Highland Line , Scots Pine in the Central Highlands , hazel / oak or pine / birch / oak assemblages in the north @-@ east and south @-@ west Highlands , and birch in the Outer Hebrides , Northern Isles and far north of the mainland . Furthermore , the effects of fire , human clearance and grazing probably limited forest cover to about 50 % of the land area of Scotland even at its maximum . The stock of woodland declined alarmingly during the First World War and " a Forestry Subcommittee was added to the Reconstruction Committee to advise on policy when the war was over . The Subcommittee , better known as the Acland Committee after its chairman Sir A. H. D. Acland , came to the conclusion that , in order to secure the double purpose of being able to be independent from foreign supplies for three years and a reasonable insurance against a timber famine , the woods of Great Britain should be gradually increased from three million acres to four and three quarter millions at the end of the war " . Following the Acland Report of 1918 the Forestry Commission was formed in 1919 to meet this need . State forest parks were established in 1935 . 
 Emergency felling controls had been introduced in the First and Second World Wars , and these were made permanent in the Forestry Act 1951 . Landowners were also given financial incentives to devote land to forests under the Dedication Scheme , which in 1981 became the Forestry Grant Scheme . By the early 1970s , the annual rate of planting exceeded 40 @,@ 000 hectares ( 99 @,@ 000 acres ) per annum . Most of this planting comprised fast @-@ growing conifers . Later in the century the balance shifted , with fewer than 20 @,@ 000 hectares ( 49 @,@ 000 acres ) per annum being planted during the 1990s , but broadleaf planting actually increased , exceeding 1 @,@ 000 hectares ( 2 @,@ 500 acres ) per year in 1987 . By the mid @-@ 1990s , more than half of new planting was broadleaf . 
 In 1988 , the Woodland Grant Scheme replaced the Forestry Grant Scheme , paying nearly twice as much for broadleaf woodland as conifers . ( In England , the Woodland Grant Scheme was subsequently replaced by the English Woodland Grant Scheme , which operates six separate kinds of grant for forestry projects . ) That year , the Farm Woodlands Scheme was also introduced , and replaced by the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme in 1992 . In the 1990s , a programme of afforestation resulted in the establishment of Community Forests and the National Forest , which celebrated the planting of its seven millionth tree in 2006 . As a result of these initiatives , the British Isles are one of a very few places in the world where the stock of forested land is actually increasing , though the rate of increase has slowed since the turn of the millennium . 
 England Rural Development Programme is the current overarching grants scheme that includes money for forested land within it . 
 = = Ancient woodland = = 
 Ancient woodland is defined as any woodland that has been continuously forested since 1600 . It is recorded on either the Register of Ancient Semi @-@ Natural Woodland or the Register of Planted Woodland Sites . There is no woodland in Britain that has not been profoundly affected by human intervention . Apart from certain native pinewoods in Scotland , it is predominantly broadleaf . Such woodland is less productive , in terms of timber yield , but ecologically rich , typically containing a number of " indicator species " of indigenous wildlife . It comprises roughly 2 @.@ 5 % of the forested area . 
 = = Native and historic tree species = = 
 Britain is relatively impoverished in terms of native species . For example , only thirty @-@ one species of deciduous tree and shrub are native to Scotland , including ten willows , four whitebeams and three birch and cherry . This is a list of tree species that existed in Britain before 1900 . The sheer number of tree species planted subsequently precludes a complete list . 
 = = Threats = = 
 Most serious disease threats to British woodland involve fungus . For conifers , the greatest threat is White Rot Fungus ( <unk> <unk> ) . Dutch Elm Disease arises from two related species of fungi in the genus Ophiostoma , spread by Elm Bark Beetles and acute oak decline has a bacterial cause . Another fungus , Nectria coccinea , causes Beech bark disease , as does Bulgaria polymorpha . Ash canker results from Nectria <unk> or Pseudomonas <unk> , and most trees are vulnerable to Honey Fungus ( Armillaria mellea ) . The oomycete Phytophthora <unk> ( responsible for " Sudden oak death " in the USA ) has killed large numbers of Japanese Larch trees in the UK . 
 Beetles , moths and weevils can also damage trees , but the majority do not cause serious harm . Notable exceptions include the Large Pine Weevil ( <unk> abietis ) , which can kill young conifers , the Spruce Bark Beetle ( <unk> <unk> ) which can kill spruces , and the Cockchafer ( Melolontha <unk> ) which eats young tree roots and can kill in a dry season . Rabbits , squirrels , voles , field mice , deer , and farm animals can pose a significant threat to trees . Air pollution , acid rain , and wildfire represent the main environmental hazards . 
 = = Timber industry = = 
 In 2013 , the UK produced 3 @,@ 582 @,@ 000 cubic metres of sawn wood , 3 @,@ 032 @,@ 000 cubic metres of wood @-@ based panels and 4 @,@ 561 @,@ 000 tonnes of paper and paperboard . The UK does not produce enough timber to satisfy domestic demand , and the country has been a net importer of timber and paper for many years . In 2008 the country imported sawn and other wood to a value of £ 1 @,@ 243 million and exported £ 98 million ; imported £ 832 million of wood @-@ based panels and exported £ 104 million ; and imported paper and paper @-@ based products to a value of £ 4 @,@ 273 million and exported £ 1 @,@ 590 million . In 2012 approximately 15 @,@ 000 people were employed in forestry and 26 @,@ 000 in primary wood production in the country , resulting in a gross value added to the country of £ 1 @,@ 936 million . With the ongoing closure of sawmills , the biomass industry is likely to be a key driver for future growth . 
 = = = Planting = = = 
 Successful forestry requires healthy , well @-@ formed trees that are resistant to diseases and parasites . The best wood has a straight , circular stem without a spiral grain or fluting , and small , evenly spaced branches . The chances of achieving these are maximised by planting good @-@ quality seed in the best possible growing environment . 
 Commercial seed is relatively inexpensive , but some foresters still prefer to collect their own seed . This should be done in dry weather , the seed kept in a well @-@ ventilated place away from damp ; broadleaved seeds do not keep well in long @-@ term storage ( apart from oak , sweet chestnut and sycamore , which can be kept ) . Conifer seed does tend to be storable . Stored seed is best pre @-@ treated by being chilled and moistened before planting . 
 Tree breeding programmes , to ensure the best seed , are hampered by the trees ' long life @-@ cycles . However , particularly since the 1950s , the Forestry Commission among other organisations has been running a programme of breeding , propagation , induced flowering and controlled pollination with the aim of producing healthy , disease @-@ resistant , fast @-@ growing stock . 
 = = = Stewardship and management = = = 
 The Forestry Commission manages almost 700 @,@ 000 hectares ( about 1 @.@ 7 million acres ) of land in England and Scotland , making it the country 's biggest land manager . The majority of the land ( 70 % ) is in Scotland , 30 % of the landholding is in England . Activities carried out on the forest estate include maintenance and improvement of the natural environment and the provision of recreation , timber harvesting to supply domestic industry , regenerating brownfield and replanting of harvested areas . 
 Afforestation was the main reason for the creation of the commission in 1919 . Britain had only 5 % of its original forest cover left and the government at that time wanted to create a strategic resource of timber . Since then forest coverage has doubled and the commission 's remit expanded to include greater focus on sustainable forest management and maximising public benefits . Woodland creation continues to be an important role of the commission , however , and works closely with government to achieve its goal of 12 % forest coverage by 2060 , championing initiatives such as The Big Tree Plant and Woodland Carbon Code . 
 The Forestry Commission is also the government body responsible for the regulation of private forestry ; felling is generally illegal without first obtaining a licence from the Commission . The Commission is also responsible for encouraging new private forest growth and development . Part of this role is carried out by providing grants in support of private forests and woodlands . 
 In contrast , Natural Resources Wales ( Welsh : <unk> Naturiol Cymru ) is a Welsh Government sponsored body , for the management of all the natural resources of Wales . It was formed from a merger of the Countryside Council for Wales , Environment Agency Wales , and the Forestry Commission Wales , and also assumes some other roles formerly taken by Welsh Government . 
 The Forest Stewardship Council , more specifically FSC UK , sets forest management standards for the UK , promotes the system and provides an information service . It looks at the environmental , social and economic impacts of the timber industry . It has issued 2 @,@ 340 Certificates of Conformity encompassing 1 @,@ 609 @,@ 414 ha of forest . 
 Plans featuring " good forestry practice " must always consider the needs of other stakeholders such as nearby communities or rural residents living within or adjacent to woodland areas . Foresters consider tree felling and environmental legislation when developing plans . Plans instruct the sustainable harvesting and replacement of trees . They indicate whether road building or other forest engineering operations are required . 
 = = = Transportation = = = 
 Currently , the vast majority of Britain 's timber uses road haulage . As forests are located in rural areas , the heavy timber vehicles have severely damaged many single lane tracks , especially in the Highlands . In order to combat this , companies are being forced to provide funding for repairs , as well as using alternative transport systems such as rail and coastal shipping . Despite the number of forest railways plummeting after the Beeching Axe , rail 's share of timber transport has risen from 3 % in 2002 with the opening of new lines in Devon , the Pennines , Scotland and South Wales by Colas Rail .

 = Mi Novia Se Me Está Poniendo Vieja = 
 " Mi Novia Se Me Está Poniendo Vieja " is a Latin pop song written by Guatemalan singer @-@ songwriter Ricardo Arjona for his thirteenth studio album , Independiente ( 2011 ) . It was produced by Arjona , Dan Warner and Lee Levin . It was released as the album 's third single on 8 May 2012 . The song was used by American telecommunications corporation AT & T on a commercial promoting the Nokia Lumia 900 smartphone , and has been widely performed on Arjona 's Metamorfosis World Tour . A music video was filmed on the Universal Studios in Los Angeles , and is protagonized by Arjona alongside his son Ricardo Arjona Jr . In 2013 , Arjona received a Song of the Year nomination at the 14th Latin Grammy Awards for the song . 
 = = Background = = 
 Independiente is the first album Arjona released as an independent artist , and through his own record label , Metamorfosis , a company he created to refocus his career . Presided by Arjona and some friends , Metamorfosis is based in Miami and Mexico City , and also includes the photographer and director Ricardo Calderón , Universal Music México 's executive Humberto Calderon and BMG 's Miriam Sommerz . Although the album is marketed with the new label , distribution was handled by Warner Music . Arjona commented many times , that he considered the way he decided to go independent raised more compromise than freedom , saying that " Inside the word ' Independent ' , even when it sounds like extreme freedom , there 's a big amount of compromise and the responsibility of being able to administrate , in the best way possible , such independence . " 
 Independiente was composed and written within one year , and marks the fourth time Arjona had collaborated with Tommy Torres , who had helped writing , composing , producing and providing backing vocals . The other three albums in which the two artists had worked together are Quién Dijo Ayer , in which Torres helped producing the singles " Quién " and " Quiero " , and offering additional work on the new versions of Arjona 's hits ; 5to Piso , and Adentro , respectively . Also , in the album , Arjona returned to his classic and trademark sound , which Torres has helped crafting it since six years now , after the drastic change he made in Poquita Ropa . On that album , the artist made use of the fewest instruments possible , simplifying his sound , and introducing what he called a " stripped @-@ down version of his music " . 
 Weeks before the release of Independiente , Arjona issued a letter in which he talked about his past relations with recording companies . In the letter , he revealed that he entered in his first record label as an exchange , commenting that " a producer , friend of mine , told them [ the record label ] that if they don 't sign me they won 't sign two artists he had [ at that time ] " , and that he received the " minimum royalty percentage " out from his most successful albums . Billboard notes that although other groups have decided to launch independently their works after having a contract with major record labels , Arjona is by far the most important artist in the Latin pop to follow this trend .

He said that he " wrote the song as a gift for my mom in a Mother 's Day and two sisters ( a couple of years ago ) [ ... ] and i thought the idea of including it on the album was very good " . Lyrically , " Mi Novia Se Me Esta Poniendo Vieja " revolves around how a son looks at their mother from a sentimental perspective , with Arjona singing " She loves me either if i <unk> as a guerrilla , or I won the Nobel Prize for Peace / She does 't care if i 'm last or first , if i 'm going as a conformist or as tenacious .

 = Amanda Award = 
 The Amanda Award ( Norwegian : <unk> ) is an award given annually at the Norwegian International Film Festival in Haugesund , Norway , to promote and improve Norwegian film . The award originated in 1985 , and has since 2005 been exclusively a film award ( not television ) . Winners are awarded a trophy by the Norwegian sculptor Kristian <unk> , and the name — and theme — of the sculpture comes from a legendary local woman from the 1920s . The award ceremony is marked every year by a major , nationally televised , event . 
 = = History = = 
 The Amanda Award was instituted in 1985 as part of the Norwegian International Film Festival " to increase the quality of and further the interest for Norwegian films " . The year 1993 marked an exception to the norm , when the so @-@ called " Nordic Amanda " included contribution from all the Nordic countries . From 2005 onwards , TV @-@ drama was no longer included among the categories honoured , as the TV @-@ specific award " <unk> " had taken over this function . Instead the award became exclusively for films . Around the same time another change occurred also . Since the beginning , the award ceremony had been produced in cooperation with the Norwegian state broadcasting corporation Norsk <unk> ( NRK ) . In 2006 , however , NRK ended the partnership , and the show has since that time been the responsibility of the private broadcasting company TV 2 . 
 In the year 2007 , a " People 's Amanda " ( " Folkets Amanda " ) was awarded for the first time , where the winner was arrived at by popular vote . The first winner of the award was the horror movie Fritt <unk> , directed by Roar <unk> . 
 = = Sculpture = = 
 The name " Amanda " is derived from a song , or sea shanty , titled " Amanda fra [ from ] Haugesund " . Supposedly the song in turn refers to a real woman from the 1920s – a lone mother who made a living from selling liquor to sailors during the prohibition period . 
 The figurine that is awarded to prize winners originated from a competition held by the local newspaper <unk> Avis in 1985 , to create a sculpture of the legendary Amanda . The competition was won by Kristian <unk> from <unk> in Akershus . The full @-@ size sculpture now stands outside the newspaper 's office , but a miniature version was adopted as a trophy for the Amanda Award . The figurine is 30 cm ( 11 @.@ 81 in ) tall , with a skirt measuring 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 51 in ) in diameter . While the current sculpture is hollow and weighs 2 @.@ 5 kg ( 5 @.@ 51 lbs ) , for the first few years it was made of solid metal . Weighing in at 4 @.@ 5 kg ( 9 @.@ 92 lbs ) it was difficult to hoist for many winners . 
 It was one of these prizes that , in the year 1986 , was won by director Anja <unk> , who decided to sell it through a newspaper advert , as a protest against that year 's budget cuts for Norwegian film . The Swedish Film Institute , which had experienced similar cuts and sympathized , bought the sculpture . In 2005 , as <unk> was presented with an honorary award , she was also given back the original sculpture by former Minister of Culture and director of the Swedish Film Institute , Åse Kleveland . 
 = = Show = = 
 The award show has long been a central point of the film festival , as well as a major television event for the whole of Norway . Particularly in earlier years , international stars were sometimes brought in to enhance the prestige of the event . Examples of this are Roger Moore , who was a special guest at the very first ceremony in 1985 , and Diana Ross in 1987 , then married to Norwegian entrepreneur Arne Næss , Jr . Other international names appearing in the show as presenters have included Ned Beatty , Lauren Bacall , Jon Voight , Brian Cox , Jeremy Irons , Ben Kingsley and Pierce Brosnan . 
 The show has in recent years been hosted by prominent Norwegian comedians . Jon <unk> , known from the TV @-@ show " <unk> på <unk> " , played host for several years in the early 2000s . Thomas <unk> , known as a stand @-@ up comedian and from several TV @-@ shows , has hosted the show in recent years . An episode that received some media attention in 2005 was when host Marit <unk> and Minister of Culture and Church Affairs from the Christian conservative party KrF , <unk> Svarstad Haugland , kissed on stage as part of a humorous routine .

 = Pikachu = 
 Pikachu ( Japanese : <unk> ) are a species of Pokémon , fictional creatures that appear in an assortment of video games , animated television shows and movies , trading card games , and comic books licensed by The Pokémon Company , a Japanese corporation . The Pikachu design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori . Pikachu first appeared in Pokémon Red and Green in Japan , and later in the first internationally released Pokémon video games , Pokémon Red and Blue , for the original Game Boy . 
 Like other species of Pokémon , Pikachu are often captured and groomed by humans to fight other Pokémon for sport . Pikachu are one of the most well @-@ known varieties of Pokémon , largely because a Pikachu is a central character in the Pokémon anime series . Pikachu is regarded as a major character of the Pokémon franchise as well as its mascot , and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years . 
 = = Concept and design = = 
 Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo , the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996 , and features several species of creatures called " Pokémon " that players , called " trainers " , are encouraged to capture , train , and use to battle other players ' Pokémon or interact with the game 's world . Pikachu was one of several different Pokémon designs conceived by Game Freak 's character development team . Artist Atsuko Nishida is credited as the main person behind Pikachu 's design , which was later finalized by artist Ken Sugimori . According to series producer Satoshi Tajiri , the name is derived from a combination of two Japanese sounds : pika , a sound an electric spark makes , and chu , a sound a mouse makes . Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu 's name as one of the most difficult to create , due to an effort to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences . 
 Standing 1 ft 4 in ( <unk> ) tall , Pikachu are mouse @-@ like creatures , and were the first " Electric @-@ type " Pokémon created , their design intended to revolve around the concept of electricity . They appear as mouse @-@ like creatures that have short , yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt shaped tails . They have black @-@ tipped , pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks , which can spark with electricity . In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl , gender differences were introduced ; a female Pikachu now has an indent at the end of its tail , giving it a heart @-@ shaped appearance . They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets . Within the context of the franchise , a Pikachu can transform , or " evolve " into a <unk> when exposed to a " <unk> " . In later titles an evolutionary predecessor was introduced named " Pichu " , which evolves into a Pikachu after establishing a close friendship with its trainer . 
 Initially both Pikachu and the Pokémon <unk> were chosen to be lead characters for the franchise merchandising , with the latter as the primary mascot to make the early comic book series more " engaging " . However , with the production of the animated series , Pikachu was chosen as the primary mascot , in an attempt to appeal to female viewers and their mothers , and under the belief that the creature presented the image of a recognizable intimate pet for children . Its color was also a deciding factor , as yellow is a primary color and easier for children to recognize from a distance , and with consideration to the fact the only other competing yellow mascot at the time was Winnie @-@ the @-@ Pooh . Though Tajiri acknowledged that the character was relatively popular with both boys and girls , the idea of Pikachu as the mascot was not his own , and stated he felt the human aspect of the series was overlooked by Japanese children who embraced Pikachu by itself more readily .

 = = = In the video games = = = 
 In the video games , Pikachu is a low @-@ level Pokémon , which has appeared in all of the games except Black and White naturally without having to trade . The game Pokémon Yellow features a Pikachu as the only available Starter Pokémon . Based on the Pikachu from the Pokémon anime , it refuses to stay in its Poké Ball , and instead follows the main character around on screen . The trainer can speak to it and it displays different reactions depending on how it is treated . An event from April 1 to May 5 , 2010 allowed players of Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver to access a route on the <unk> which solely contained Pikachu which knew attacks that they were not normally compatible with , Surf and Fly . Both of these attacks can be used outside battles as travel aids . 
 Aside from the main series , Pikachu stars in Hey You , Pikachu ! for the Nintendo 64 . The player interacts with Pikachu through a microphone , issuing commands to play various mini @-@ games and act out situations . The game Pokémon Channel follows a similar premise of interacting with the Pikachu , though without the microphone . Pikachu appear in almost all levels of Pokémon Snap , a game where the player takes pictures of Pokémon for a score . A Pikachu is one of the sixteen starters and ten partners in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games . PokéPark Wii : Pikachu 's Adventure features a Pikachu as the main protagonist . Pikachu has also appeared in all four Super Smash Bros. games as a playable character . Pikachu is an amiibo character . Pikachu appears as a playable fighter in Pokkén Tournament , along with " Pikachu Libre " , based on " Cosplay Pikachu " from Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire . <unk> Pikachu : Shin <unk> Tanjō features a talking Pikachu who becomes a detective and helps to solve mysteries .

 The Pokémon anime series and films feature the adventures of Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu , traveling through the various regions of the Pokémon universe . They are accompanied by a group of alternating friends , including Misty , Brock , Tracey , May , Max , Dawn , Iris , <unk> , Bonnie , Serena , and <unk> . 
 In the first episode , Ash Ketchum , a young boy from <unk> Town turns 10 years old and is ready to acquire his first Pokémon . Hopeful to become a Pokémon Master , the night before he receives his starter Pokémon ( either Squirtle , Charmander or Bulbasaur ) he has a dream where he is catching a Pokémon and actually while sleeping , physically breaks his alarm clock . Ash quickly runs to Professor Oak 's lab , where he finds out all the starter Pokémon have been given away . Professor Oak tells Ash there is one more Pokémon , a Pikachu . At first , Pikachu largely ignores Ash 's requests , shocking him frequently and refusing to be confined to the conventional method of Pokémon transportation , a Poké Ball . However , Ash puts himself in danger to defend Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow , then rushes the electric mouse to a Pokémon Center . Through these demonstrations of respect and unconditional commitment to Pokémon , Pikachu warms up to Ash , and their friendship is formed . However , it still refuses to go into its Poké Ball . Soon after , Pikachu shows great power that sets it apart from Pokémon , and other Pikachu , which causes Team Rocket to constantly attempt to capture it in order to win favor from their boss , Giovanni . Only once had Ash almost released Pikachu , and that was in the episode Pikachu 's Goodbye , because Ash thought Pikachu would be happier living in a colony of wild Pikachu , but Pikachu chose him instead . Pikachu also has his very own segment in the first two seasons called " Pikachu 's Jukebox " , which included songs from <unk> Master . 
 Other wild and trained Pikachu appear throughout the series , often interacting with Ash and his Pikachu . The most notable among these is Ritchie 's Pikachu , Sparky . Like most other Pokémon , Pikachu communicates only by saying syllables of its own name . It is voiced by <unk> Ōtani in all versions of the anime . In Pokémon Live ! , the musical stage show adapted from the anime , Pikachu was played by Jennifer <unk> .

 Pikachu is one of the main Pokémon used in many of the Pokémon manga series . In Pokémon Adventures , main characters Red and Yellow both train Pikachu , which create an egg that Gold hatches into a Pichu . Other series , including Magical Pokémon Journey and Getto Da Ze also feature Pikachu while other manga series , such as Electric Tale of Pikachu , and Ash & Pikachu , feature the most well known Pikachu belonging to Ketchum in the anime series . 
 Collectible cards featuring Pikachu have appeared since the initial Pokémon Trading Card Game released in October 1996 , including limited edition promotional cards . The character has also been used in promotional merchandising at fast @-@ food chains such as McDonald 's , Wendy 's and Burger King .

 As a mascot for the franchise , Pikachu has made multiple appearances in various promotional events and merchandise . In 1998 , then @-@ Mayor of Topeka , Kansas Joan <unk> renamed the town " <unk> " for a day , and a " got milk ? " advertisement featured Pikachu on April 25 , 2000 . A Pikachu balloon has been featured in the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade since 2001 . The original balloon was flown for the last time publicly at the Pokémon Tenth Anniversary " Party of the Decade " on August 8 , 2006 in Bryant Park in New York City , and a new Pikachu Balloon that chases a Poké Ball and has light @-@ up cheeks debuted at the 2006 Parade . In 2014 's parade , a new Pikachu balloon was wearing a green scarf and holding a smaller Pikachu snowman . 
 During the first episode of the eleventh series of Top Gear , presenter Richard Hammond compared an image of the Tata Nano to one of Pikachu stating " they 've saved money on the styling ' cause they 've just based it on this . " In the episode " Dual " of the third season of Heroes , Hiro Nakamura is nicknamed " Pikachu " by Daphne Millbrook , much to his chagrin . He is called this again by Tracy Strauss , after which he excuses himself before punching her in the face . A Pikachu spoof called Ling @-@ Ling was a main character in the Comedy Central show Drawn Together . An image of Pikachu has also been featured on the ANA Boeing 747 @-@ 400 ( <unk> ) . 
 Pikachu has appeared multiple times on The Simpsons . In the 2002 episode " Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade " , Bart Simpson has a hallucination while taking a test in class and envisages his classmates as various television characters , one of which is a Pikachu . Maggie Simpson appeared as a Pikachu in a couch gag during the opening animation of the 2003 episode " ' Tis the Fifteenth Season " . The couch gag was utilized a second time for the 2004 episode " <unk> News " . In the 2010 episode " Postcards from the Wedge " , Bart is distracted from his homework by an episode of Pokémon . After watching Ash Ketchum talk to his Pikachu , he muses how the show has managed to stay fresh over the years . 
 Pikachu was ranked as the second best person of the year by Time in 1999 , who called it " The most beloved animated character since Hello Kitty " . The magazine noted Pikachu as the " public face of a phenomenon that has spread from Nintendo 's fastest selling video game to a trading @-@ card empire " , citing the franchise 's profits for the year as the reason for the ranking ; behind singer Ricky Martin but ahead of author J.K. Rowling . The character placed eighth in a 2000 Animax poll of favorite anime characters . In 2002 , Ash 's Pikachu received fifteenth place in TV Guide 's 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time . GameSpot featured it in their article " All Time Greatest Game Hero " . In 2003 Forbes ranked Pikachu as the eighth top @-@ earning fictional character of the year with an income of $ 825 million .

In a 2008 Oricon poll Pikachu was voted as the fourth most popular video game character in Japan , tying with Solid Snake . The character has been regarded as the Japanese answer to Mickey Mouse and as being part of a movement of " cute capitalism " . Pikachu was listed 8th in IGN 's " Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time " . Nintendo Power listed Pikachu as their ninth favourite hero , stating that while it was one of the first Pokémon , it is still popular to this day . Authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll called Pikachu the best Electric type Pokémon and the best Pokémon overall . They added that if a person were to go around and ask Pokémon players who their favourite Pokémon was , they would " almost always " choose Pikachu . They also called Pikachu " brave and loyal " . On a less positive note , Pikachu was ranked first in AskMen 's top 10 of the most irritating 1990s cartoon characters . Similarly , in a poll conducted by IGN , it was voted as the 48th best Pokémon , with the staff commenting " despite being the most recognized Pokémon in the world ... Pikachu ranks surprisingly low on our top 100 " . 
 A newly discovered ligand believed to provide better visual acuity , discovered by Osaka Bioscience Institute Foundation ( <unk> ) , is named " <unk> " , borrowed from the nimbleness of Pikachu . The name was inspired due to Pikachu 's " lightning @-@ fast moves and shocking electric effects " . 
 Pikachu and ten other Pokémon were chosen as Japan 's mascots in the 2014 FIFA World Cup . 
 = Lawrence Wetherby = 
 Lawrence Winchester Wetherby ( January 2 , 1908 – March 27 , 1994 ) was an American politician who served as lieutenant governor and governor of Kentucky . He is the only governor in state history born in Jefferson County , despite the fact that Louisville , the county seat , is the state 's most populous city . 
 After graduating from the University of Louisville , Wetherby held several minor offices in the Jefferson County judicial system before being elected lieutenant governor in 1947 . He was called Kentucky 's first " working " lieutenant governor because Governor Earle C. Clements asked him to carry out duties beyond his constitutional responsibility to preside over the state Senate , such as preparing the state budget and attending the Southern Governors Conference . In 1950 , Clements resigned to assume a seat in the U.S. Senate , elevating Wetherby to governor . Wetherby won immediate acclaim by calling a special legislative session to increase funding for education and government benefits from the state 's budget surplus . In 1951 , he won a four @-@ year full term as governor , during which he continued and expanded many of Clements ' programs , including increased road construction and industrial diversification . He endorsed the Supreme Court 's 1954 desegregation order in the case of Brown v. Board of Education and appointed a biracial commission to oversee the successful integration of the state 's schools . As chair of the Southern Governors Conference in 1954 and 1955 , he encouraged other southern governors to accept and implement desegregation . 
 Limited to one term by the state constitution , Wetherby supported Bert T. Combs to be his successor , but Combs lost in the Democratic primary to A. B. " Happy " Chandler , a former governor and factional opponent of both Wetherby and Clements . Chandler 's failure to support Wetherby 's 1956 bid to succeed Democrat Alben Barkley in the Senate contributed to his loss to Republican John Sherman Cooper . From 1964 to 1966 , Wetherby served on a commission charged with revising the state constitution , and in 1966 he was elected to the Kentucky Senate , where he provided leadership in drafting the state budget . Following this , he retired from politics and served as a consultant for Brighton Engineering . He died March 27 , 1994 of complications from a broken hip and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort , Kentucky . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Lawrence Wetherby was born January 2 , 1908 in Middletown , Kentucky . He was the fourth child of Samuel Davis and Fanny ( <unk> ) Wetherby . His grandfather was a surgeon in the Union Army during the Civil War . His father was also a physician and farmer , and during his childhood years , Wetherby worked on the family farm . 
 After graduating from Anchorage High School , Wetherby enrolled in the pre @-@ law program at the University of Louisville . He was a letterman on the football team in 1927 and 1928 ; he also played second base on the baseball team in 1928 and 1929 , and was a letterman in that sport in 1929 . He was later inducted into the university 's Athletic Hall of Fame . In 1929 , he earned his Bachelor of Laws degree and went to work for Judge Henry Tilford . The two would remain partners until 1950 . On April 24 , 1930 , he married Helen Dwyer ; the couple had three children . 
 Thanks to his father 's influence , Wetherby became interested in local politics at an early age . School board races fascinated him , and he allied himself with a faction of the Jefferson County Democratic Party headed by Leland Taylor and Ben Ewing . When Ewing was elected county judge in 1933 , he appointed Wetherby as a part @-@ time attorney for the Jefferson County juvenile court . He held this position through 1937 , then returned to it in 1942 and 1943 . In March 1943 , he was appointed the first trial commissioner of the juvenile court . 
 = = Lieutenant governor = = 
 Wetherby was elected chairman of the 34th Legislative District Democratic Committee in 1943 and held the position through 1956 . In March 1947 , he resigned as trial commissioner of the juvenile court in order to run for lieutenant governor . The strongest of his four opponents in the Democratic primary was Bill May , the nephew of U.S. Representative Andrew J. May . May had sought the support of gubernatorial candidate Earle C. Clements , but Clements refused , possibly because Congressman May was an ally of Clements ' political opponent John Y. Brown . Wetherby was also unable to secure Clements ' public endorsement , but he won the primary and went on to defeat Republican Orville M. Howard by over 95 @,@ 000 votes . 
 Despite Clements ' refusal to endorse Wetherby in the primary , the two generally agreed on their legislative agendas and worked well together . Some observers called Wetherby Kentucky 's first " working " lieutenant governor . Previous lieutenant governors did little beyond their constitutionally mandated duty of presiding over the Kentucky Senate , but during Clements ' administration , Wetherby was charged with preparing a state budget , presiding over the Legislative Research Commission , leading tours for the state Chamber of Commerce , and attending the Southern Governors Conference . Clements also made Wetherby executive secretary of the State Democratic Central Committee , which allowed Wetherby to make many important political contacts . 
 = = Governor of Kentucky = = 
 On November 27 , 1950 , Clements resigned to accept a seat in the U.S. Senate , elevating Wetherby to governor . One of his first actions was to call a special legislative session to convene on March 6 , 1951 for the purpose of allocating the state 's $ 10 million budget surplus . Among the expenditures approved in the special session were increases in teachers ' salaries and state benefits for the needy and government employees . Wetherby 's popularity soared as a result of this session , and he seriously considered running for the Senate seat vacated by the death of Virgil Chapman in 1951 . Instead , after talking with Clements and other Democratic leaders , he decided to seek a full , four @-@ year term as governor . 
 = = = Election of 1951 = = = 
 Among the potential candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1951 was former governor A. B. " Happy " Chandler , who was about to be released as baseball commissioner . Chandler and Clements were bitter political enemies , and the possibility of a Chandler candidacy provided the Clements faction of the Democratic party with the impetus to unite behind Wetherby to prevent Chandler from gaining the nomination . Ultimately , Chandler did not seek the nomination and , despite implying that Clements controlled Wetherby , Chandler endorsed Wetherby on May 15 , 1951 . Wetherby had little trouble defeating Howell Vincent and Jesse Cecil in the Democratic gubernatorial primary , polling the largest majority ever in a Kentucky primary race . 
 In the general election , Wetherby faced Republican Court of Appeals judge Eugene Siler . Siler was a fundamentalist Christian who claimed that the state government was full of corruption , and only he could stop it . Citing the gambling in Northern Kentucky , bribery accusations against members of Clements ' and Wetherby 's administrations , and a 1951 scandal involving the University of Kentucky men 's basketball team , he referred to Frankfort as " our Nineveh on the Kentucky River " . Wetherby countered Siler 's accusations of corruption by removing one of the officials accused of bribery from office . He deployed the newly organized Kentucky State Police to counter organized crime in Campbell and Henderson counties . To further discourage crime , he supported legislation to revoke the alcohol licenses of establishments that allowed gambling . Siler 's pro @-@ temperance and anti @-@ Catholic views played well in the state 's rural areas , but cost him the vote of the growing urban population . Wetherby won the election by a vote of 346 @,@ 345 to 288 @,@ 014 . 
 = = = Administration = = = 
 Early in Wetherby 's term , the state 's revenues were inflated by the Korean War . Having adopted a pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ go program for the state , he was forced to raise additional revenue after the war ended . He did so by imposing sin taxes on cigarettes , alcoholic beverages , and parimutuel betting , but he was unable to convince the General Assembly to adopt a sales tax . 
 Because three members of Wetherby 's close family had been killed in automobile accidents on the state 's roadways , improving roads was a high priority for Wetherby . Using revenue from a two @-@ cent @-@ per @-@ gallon gasoline tax passed under the Clements administration , Wetherby authorized the building , re @-@ building , or re @-@ surfacing of nearly 6 @,@ 000 miles ( 9 @,@ 700 km ) of roads during his administration . The most important of these was the state 's first toll road — the Kentucky Turnpike — connecting Louisville and Elizabethtown . He encouraged President Dwight D. Eisenhower to construct a federal toll road connecting the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico . Other political leaders joined him , convincing Eisenhower to construct the long @-@ talked @-@ about Interstate Highway System . Improved roads brought increased tourism , which Wetherby supported by increasing funding to the state park system and adding Breaks Interstate Park , a new park owned jointly by Kentucky and Virginia . Wetherby also brought national attention to Kentucky as prime hunting and fishing land by conducting his own personal sporting excursions in the state . 
 Wetherby tried to diversify the industries located in Kentucky to balance the state 's primarily agrarian economy . He expanded the Agricultural and Industrial Development Board and charged it with conducting land surveys to identify potential industrial sites . He encouraged the development of modern airports in the state and supported the canalization of the Big Sandy River and improvement of the locks and dams on the Kentucky River . He continued to personally lead tours given by the state 's Chamber of Commerce . Among the industries that came to the state during his administration were the General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah . In 1954 , he used the state police to quash labor unrest in Central City and other parts of the Western Coal Fields . He was not a pawn of industry , however : he secured passage of the state 's first laws regulating strip mining and killed a right @-@ to @-@ work bill in 1954 . 
 Neither did Wetherby ignore the needs of agriculture . Under his Green Pastures Program , measures were enacted to diversify crop production , improve beef production , and encourage soil conservation . He secured federal flood control programs for the watersheds of the Salt , Licking , Green , and Kentucky Rivers , saving valuable farmland . In 1952 , Wetherby organized an agricultural council to consolidate the work of the state 's agricultural bureaucracy . He oversaw completion of the state fairgrounds in Louisville , a project begun under Clements , to better display the state 's agricultural products . 
 Improvements in education were a hallmark of Wetherby 's term as governor . Over the course of his administration , he increased funding to education by $ 20 million . He called for the creation of an educational television network and initiated the state 's first publicly funded bookmobile program . He supported the 1954 Minimum Foundation Program , an amendment to the state constitution that allowed funding to be allocated to school districts based upon need rather than number of pupils . 
 In 1954 and 1955 Wetherby served as chairman of the Southern Governors Conference and urged the southern governors to peacefully implement desegregation as required by the Supreme Court 's decision in Brown v. Board of Education . He was one of five southern governors that refused to sign a statement opposing integration . In Kentucky , he appointed an advisory council of both white and black citizens to oversee public school integration , which was accomplished with little acrimony compared to other states . Desegregation was one issue where Wetherby and his lieutenant governor , Emerson " Doc " Beauchamp , disagreed , but because Beauchamp believed he would succeed Wetherby as governor , he did not openly oppose Wetherby 's actions . 
 Among Wetherby 's other accomplishments were the creation of a Department of Mental Health and the construction of fifteen hospitals and thirty health centers throughout the state . In 1952 , he created the Youth Authority as a central point for the administration of services to delinquent children . He constructed new state prisons , modernized the probation and parole systems , and established a more orderly system of selecting grand and petit juries . He also oversaw some voting reform measures , including the provision of funds to purchase voting machines in areas where they were desired . He was not as successful in the area of government reform . He failed in his efforts to amend the state 's constitution to allow the governor to succeed himself in office . He was also unable to win support for a plan to consolidate some of Kentucky 's counties . In 1955 , the state 's voters approved a constitutional amendment granting suffrage to eighteen @-@ year @-@ olds over Wetherby 's objections . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Both Clements and Wetherby endorsed Bert T. Combs to succeed Wetherby as governor . Wetherby had named Combs to the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1951 to fill a vacancy created by the death of Judge Roy Helm . Happy Chandler , Clements ' old foe , ran against Combs in the primary and painted him as a pawn of " Clementine " and " Wetherbine " , his derogatory nicknames for Clements and Wetherby . In fact , Chandler ran the entire campaign not just against Combs , but against Clements and Wetherby as well . He charged both Clements and Wetherby with extravagant spending in their administrations . Among his allegations were that Clements had purchased a $ 20 @,@ 000 rug for his office and that Wetherby had paneled his office with African mahogany . Chandler promised that , if elected , he would use " good , honest Kentucky wood " in his office and that all Kentuckians would be invited to the capitol to walk on the $ 20 @,@ 000 rug . Ultimately , invoices showed that no $ 20 @,@ 000 rug had been purchased by Clements and Wetherby 's paneling had been purchased from and installed by a local contractor . Chandler 's charges may have been inaccurate , but he defeated Combs in the primary and went on to win the general election . 
 Following his term as governor , Wetherby resumed his private law practice . In 1956 , Senator Alben Barkley unexpectedly died of a heart attack . The timing of his death meant that the state would elect two senators in 1956 — Clements ' term was expiring and now Barkley 's seat was vacant . President Eisenhower convinced former senator and ambassador John Sherman Cooper to be the Republican candidate for the seat , hoping Cooper 's immense popularity in the state would help his own re @-@ election bid . Barkley 's death occurred so late in the year that there was not time for a Democratic primary to choose the party 's candidate for the open seat . The Democratic state committee chose Wetherby , who was only six months removed from his term as governor . 
 Neither Wetherby nor Clements enjoyed the support of Governor Chandler . Coupled with this , Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson suffered a heart attack during the campaign , and as majority whip , Clements assumed the role of acting majority leader . This took him away from the campaign trail for extended periods of time . During the infrequent visits he was able to make to the state , he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor , Wetherby . In the general election , Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65 @,@ 000 votes and Clements lost to Thruston Ballard Morton by about 7 @,@ 000 votes . It was the first time Clements had lost a race in thirty years , and Kentucky Democrats would not elect a senator again for another sixteen years . 
 After this defeat , Wetherby moved to Franklin County and secured a position at Brighton Engineering with help from his old primary opponent , Bill May . From 1964 to 1966 , he was a delegate to an assembly charged with revising the state constitution . In 1965 , May backed Wetherby in his campaign for the Kentucky Senate . He won the election , defeating the candidate favored by Chandler , and was chosen president of that body from 1966 to 1968 . He was so effective in this position that the state 's 1966 budget was debated for only ten days before passing by a vote of 31 – 5 in virtually the same form as it was presented . 
 After his service in the state senate , Wetherby returned to Brighton Engineering , where he eventually became a vice @-@ president . He died March 27 , 1994 of complications from a broken hip . He is buried at the Frankfort Cemetery . The administration building at Western Kentucky University and a gymnasium at Morehead State University were named in his honor . 
 = Wulfred = 
 Wulfred ( died 24 March 832 ) was an Anglo @-@ Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury in medieval England . Nothing is known of his life prior to 803 , when he attended a church council , but he was probably a nobleman from Middlesex . He was elected archbishop in 805 and spent his time in office reforming the clergy of his cathedral . He also quarrelled with two consecutive Mercian kings – Coenwulf and Ceolwulf – over whether laymen or clergy should control monasteries . At one point , Wulfred travelled to Rome to consult with the papacy and was deposed from office for a number of years over the issue . After Coenwulf 's death , relations were somewhat better with the new king Ceolwulf , but improved much more after Ceolwulf 's subsequent deposition . The dispute about control of the monasteries was not fully settled until 838 , after Wulfred 's death . Wulfred was the first archbishop to place his portrait on the coinage he struck . 
 = = Reform of Christ Church = = 
 One of Wulfred 's main objects as archbishop was the reformation of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury – that of Christ Church . A main tenet was the establishment of communal life for the clergy in the cathedral chapter . This effort was modelled on that of Bishop Chrodegang of Metz . By 813 , Wulfred was already claiming in a document that he had " revived the holy monastery of the church of Canterbury by renewing , restoring and rebuilding it " . Wulfred may have based the rule of the community on Chrodegang 's Regula <unk> , or perhaps on the rule of Benedict . His efforts including requiring the clergy to eat together , to give over their personal property to the chapter , and ensuring that the canonical hours were kept as part of the liturgy . Although it is clear that a communal style of living was practised , whether the cathedral clergy were transformed into canons or if they remained monks is unclear . Later , Wulfred granted land to the chapter , but the gifts would only be valid as long as the chapter kept to the new standards . Wulfred also used his personal wealth to fund the construction of new buildings . 
 = = Disputes with Coenwulf = = 
 Wulfred came into conflict with King Coenwulf of Mercia over the issue of whether laymen could control religious houses , with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries . In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Cenwulf had not yet made peace with the archbishop , but by 809 they seem to have been on good terms ; the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815 . 
 In 814 , Wulfred travelled to Rome to visit Pope Leo III . Although the exact nature of his business with the pope is unknown , it was likely connected with the issue that arose between the archbishop and Coenwulf over lay control of monasteries . He was accompanied by the bishop of Sherborne , <unk> . Laymen controlling monasteries had been customary for centuries , though in the half @-@ century or so before Wulfred became archbishop the church had begun to assert control over monasteries . In England , this attempt to secure control was manifested in decrees made by synods at Clofesho in 803 and more especially the synod of Chelsea in 816 . Tensions over the Kentish monastic houses of Reculver and Minster @-@ in @-@ Thanet reached such a point that Wulfred was deprived of authority by the king for a period of some years ; six according to the document drawn up in 825 recording the – then victorious – Canterbury view of the debate , though four is perhaps more likely . Wulfred still witnessed documents as archbishop in 817 , and by September 822 , he was once more officiating as archbishop , when he consecrated King Ceolwulf of Mercia . Wulfred was driven into exile briefly at some point during his suspension from office . However , the dispute was still active in the last years of Coenwulf 's reign , as at a council held perhaps in 821 , the king threatened the archbishop with exile unless he yielded . Wulfred and the Canterbury community fought Coenwulf vigorously , sending embassies to the pope and concocting forgeries in their favour which purported to have been issued by earlier kings . 
 Around 820 Coenwulf forced Wulfred into an unfavourable settlement by which Wulfred gained control over the debated monasteries in exchange for a large payment of gold and the loss of a very large estate to the king . Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop . In September 822 , Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf 's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king , which had been delayed about a year because of the dispute with the archbishop . After <unk> 's deposition in 823 Wulfred 's situation improved . The new Mercian king , Beornwulf , presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred 's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to that point was written down . Coenwulf 's daughter <unk> , abbess of Winchcombe and Minster , paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over the houses in Kent . Later in 825 ( or possibly the following year ) , however , Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun . Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold , and coinage in Wulfred 's name appears to have ceased for a time , though it had been restored before Wulfred 's death in 832 . Final settlement of the debate over lordship of monasteries came in 838 at Kingston , shortly before Egbert 's death . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Wulfred died in 832 , probably on 24 March . Most of his wealth was left to a kinsman , Werhard , who was to give the lands to Christ Church after his own death . Werhard , who was a member of the monastery of Christ Church , rose to the position of " priest @-@ abbot " by the middle years of the 830s . This is known from Wulfred 's will , which survives in a late copy . This document names Werhard as Wulfred 's nephew , and calls him priest . 
 The Christ Church scriptorium was particularly active under Wulfred . Although the handwriting of the documents produced during Wulfred 's archiepiscopate is quite elegant , the actual contents of the charters is marked by bad grammar and other errors . From this , the historian N. P. Brooks has deduced that the clergy of the cathedral were not very literate in Latin , and would have likely been unable to compose new Latin works . 
 Wulfred was the first archbishop to place his portrait on the pennies struck in his name which , unlike those of previous archbishops , never made reference to the ruling Mercian king . Wulfred also rebuilt some buildings at Christ Church , Canterbury , although it is not known whether these were support buildings , such as the dormitory and refractory , or if he rebuilt the cathedral itself . 
 = Lake Winfield Scott = 
 Lake Winfield Scott is an 18 @-@ acre ( 7 @.@ 3 ha ) mountain pond located 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of <unk> , Georgia in Union County . The lake , which is owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service , is the source of Cooper Creek . It is the centerpiece of the Forest Service 's Lake Winfield Scott Recreation Area , a park which features hiking , fishing , boating and other outdoor activities . At 2 @,@ 854 feet ( 870 m ) elevation it is one of Georgia 's highest altitude lakes . The various habitats surrounding the lake support a wide assortment of plants and animals . 
 = = History = = 
 Completed in early 1942 , Lake Winfield Scott is a man @-@ made reservoir created as part of the Civilian Conservation Corps ' efforts to establish recreational areas in north Georgia . It was the final CCC project in Georgia and one of the last in the nation , completed just after the United States ' entry into World War II . It is located in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains near Blood Mountain . 
 The lake was named after General Winfield Scott , a 19th @-@ century United States Army general , diplomat , and presidential candidate . Known as " Old Fuss and Feathers " and the " Grand Old Man of the Army " , Scott was a hero of the Mexican @-@ American War and the first American since George Washington to hold the rank of lieutenant general . 
 By the late 17th century the Cherokee and Creek had begun to compete for the same resources and fought a battle at nearby Slaughter Gap . The Creek lost , ceding the Blood Mountain area to the Cherokee , who considered it a holy place . Archaeological evidence has been discovered that tends to back the story of the battle , but the date of the battle and its participants are still disputed . 
 In 1838 , the American Indians were removed from the area by General Winfield Scott and forced westward along the " Trail of Tears . " Farmers moved in later , and by the 1880s lumber companies began logging the area . On May 14 , 1938 , the lake was first opened to the public as part of the Forest Service 's multiple @-@ use plan for administering the <unk> National Forest for the " greatest good for the greatest number of people . " During the 1990s , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rebuilt and strengthened the lake 's dam .

 Lake Winfield Scott is 4 @.@ 5 miles east of <unk> on Highway 180 and 7 @.@ 1 miles west of U.S. Highway 19 / 129 near Vogel State Park . Two roads provide access to the park , although the north entrance is only for lake access . The south entrance leads to the campgrounds , hiking trails and lakeshore facilities . The hardwood forests surrounding the lake and in <unk> Gap offer brilliant autumn displays , making it a popular destination during the leaf season . 
 = = = Wildlife and flora = = = 
 Like the rest of the southern Blue Ridge Mountains , the area surrounding the lake consists of many valleys , ridges and mountains formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions , starting with the Grenville Orogeny nearly 1 @.@ 5 billion years ago . The resulting landscape created diverse topology containing many different species of plants and animal . Much of the area is similar to Pennsylvania in climate , vegetation and wildlife . The lake is near the southern limit for Eastern hemlock and Eastern white pine . Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography , with second @-@ growth oak and hickory more common in lower @-@ lying areas . Forests surrounding the lake contain rich , high @-@ altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns , such as Painted Trillium , which grows near <unk> . <unk> near <unk> Cove include Dutchman 's breeches , squirrel corn , waterleaf and other herbaceous plants . 
 The lake area is populated with white tail deer , grouse and raccoon . The deer population , which was extirpated by 1895 , has rebounded since re @-@ introduction by park ranger Arthur Woody during the 1930s . Over 100 species of birds inhabit or migrate through the area , including native songbirds such as the Canada , Blackburnian , Black @-@ throated Blue , Black @-@ throated Green and Chestnut @-@ sided warblers . Also found are hawks , owls , woodpeckers , kinglets , thrushes , vireos , cuckoos , <unk> , chickadees , titmice , nuthatches , brown creepers , wrens , tanagers , grosbeaks , indigo buntings and red crossbills . Migratory species are present during the late spring and early fall , making the area popular among birdwatchers . The creeks surrounding the lake are rich with different species of salamanders .

The recreational area includes a children 's playground and picnic sites . The campground is open spring through fall and is administered by the USFS 's Chattahoochee @-@ Oconee National Forest / Blue Ridge Ranger District . 
 There are three trails at the lake . The 0 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 640 m ) Lake Winfield Scott Trail circles around the lake shore . This easy trail has portions which are wheelchair accessible . Jarrad Gap Trail and Slaughter Gap Trail share a common trailhead , located on the lake 's southern tip . Both are approach trails to the nearby Appalachian Trail and are marked with blue blazes . 
 Slaughter Creek Trail passes through a hardwood forest on the south bank of Slaughter Creek for most of its distance , following a series of old roadbeds . It climbs 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) over its 2 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 3 km ) path to Slaughter Gap ( elevation 3 @,@ 920 feet ) , where it intersects the Appalachian Trail at the base of Blood Mountain .

 = Music of Athens , Georgia = 
 The music of Athens , Georgia , includes a wide variety of popular music and was an important part of the early evolution of alternative rock and new wave . The city is well known as the home of chart @-@ topping bands like R.E.M. and The B @-@ 52s , C Fresh , and several long @-@ time indie / rock hip @-@ hop groups . Athens hosts the Athens Symphony Orchestra and other music institutions , as well as prominent local music media , such as the college radio station WUOG . Much of the modern Athens music scene relies on students from the large University of Georgia campus in the city . The University sponsors Western classical performances and groups specializing in other styles . 
 Athens became a center for music in the region during the Civil War and gained further fame in the early twentieth century with the founding of the Morton Theatre , which was a major touring destination for African American performers . The city 's local rock music scene can be traced to the 1950s , with live music at Allen 's <unk> in Normaltown . International attention came in the 1970s when the B @-@ 52 's began releasing the first of several best @-@ selling recordings . Athens @-@ based rock bands have performed in a wide array of styles , and the city has never had a characteristic style of rock ; most of the bands have been united only in their quirky and iconoclastic image . 
 Music author Richie Unterberger describes the town as an unlikely center for musical development , as a " sleepy [ place where ] it 's difficult to imagine anyone working up a sweat , let alone playing rock music . " The contributions of Athens to rock , country music , and bluegrass have earned it the nickname " the Liverpool of the South " , and the city is known as one of the American birthplaces for both modern alternative rock and new wave music . Athens was home to the first and most famous college music scene in the country , beginning in the 1970s . 
 = = Music venues and institutions = = 
 Athens ' local music is based primarily in the small downtown area of the northern part of the town . The nightclub 40 Watt Club is among the most famous indie rock venues on the East Coast ; the club opened on Halloween in 1978 , with a band called Strictly American featuring Curtis Crowe , founder of the club and future member of the band Pylon . Other major music venues in the city include the Georgia Theater , ( a converted cinema that hosted both local and touring performers . The Theater burned down in June 2009 , but has been fully remodelled into a state of the art music venue reopening in early August 2011 ) , the Caledonia Lounge , the Melting Point , and the UGA Performing Arts Center , home to the Ramsey Concert Hall and the Hugh Hodgson Concert Hall . The Morton Theater is a historic venue , a major part of the city 's African American community in the early 20th century ; it claims to be the only theater from that era remaining in operation . 
 Athens is home to the summer music festival <unk> , <unk> , the Athens <unk> and the late spring Athens Human Rights Festival and North Georgia Folk Festival . The college radio station WUOG ( 90 @.@ 5 FM ) , the low @-@ power ( 100 @.@ 7 ) FM <unk> @-@ LP and the free weekly <unk> are the city 's most prominent modern music media . Athens has never produced a major local label like many similar indie rock towns ; the most important label of the 1970s and 1980s was DB Records , based out of Atlanta , though jangle pop pioneers <unk> Records and <unk> Records were also Athens @-@ based . 
 Local music institutions include the Athens Symphony Orchestra , Athens Choral Society ( founded in 1971 ) , Athens Youth Symphony and the Athens Folk Music and Dance Society . The Athens Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1978 as a firmly non @-@ profit , strictly volunteer organization , conducted by Albert Ligotti of the University of Georgia . The first performance came in 1979 ; the Orchestra now has two regular performances , one in the summer and one in the winter , and has also done shows for young people , pops concerts and Christmas concerts . In 1996 , the Athens Symphony moved into its modern home , the Classic Center Theatre in downtown Athens . 
 The University of Georgia 's Athens campus has long been an important part of local music . Country Music Hall of Fame song <unk> and performer " Whispering " Bill Anderson attended UGA and used to play guitar around campus . The faculty of the Hugh Hodgson School of Music operate the Georgia Brass Quintet and Georgia Woodwind Quintet . Student institutions include the ARCO Chamber Orchestra , Men 's and Women 's Glee Clubs , several concert choirs , jazz bands , and brass and woodwind ensembles , the Redcoat Marching Band , the University Philharmonia and a Symphony Orchestra . The University of Georgia Glee Clubs launched a pair of a cappella offshoot groups . They are now called Noteworthy and <unk> ( female and male vocal groups , respectively ) , who are regionally known . 
 = = History = = 
 The earliest music in North Georgia , including what is now Athens , was that of the Native Americans of the area , principally the Creek and the Cherokee . Athens was officially chartered in 1806 , and began growing rapidly near the middle of the 19th century . By the time of the American Civil War in the 1860s , the city was an important part of musical life in Georgia . The war accelerated the development of the city 's musical importance , as Athens was largely spared widespread destruction while the larger city of Atlanta took a long time to recover . Major touring acts like the Dixie Family and The <unk> visited Athens during the war ; the Dixie Family , a prominent touring group , performed disastrously , according to local newspapers , who said that the highlight of the performance came from four local African American musicians , and the Dixie Family had absconded with the concert 's proceeds , which had been promised to the local Ladies Aid Society . In the 1870s , the city was almost half African American , and local black @-@ owned industry flourished ; among the residents was Bob Cole , born in 1868 to a musically active family . Cole would later become a pioneer in African American theater , known for works like the 1898 musical A Trip to <unk> . 
 African American industry , churches and other institutions grew rapidly in prominence through the end of the 19th century . The city 's African American community was well established by the beginning of the 20th century , when the corner of Lumpkin and Washington Streets became a major center for the city 's black culture . This area was known as the Hot Corner , and was owned by a number of black professional businesses , as well as many performance spaces and a renowned opera house in the Morton Building that hosted such national figures as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington . The Morton Theater was one of the preeminent venues in the city in the early 20th century , and is the only such theater to survive to the present , though it was not in operation for many years , until re @-@ opening in 1993 . 
 = = = Origins of the modern scene = = = 
 In the 1950s , the city 's musical life consisted primarily of dances at local venues like the American Legion Hall and the YMCA , where popular bandleaders included most famously Jimmy Dorsey . The Canteen was a spot in Memorial Park in Athens , which became an important performance space after local musician Terry " Mad Dog " Melton and his group began playing there in 1958 . The Canteen later hosted local Motown / beach legends The Jesters , who have continued to perform from 1964 to the present . 
 Later in the 1960s and into the 1970s , locally prominent bands gradually changed from primarily cover bands to more well rounded groups , while the city 's musical opportunities grew with the foundation of venues and institutions . This period has been called the Normaltown River of Music , and included long @-@ time local performers like Mad Dog Melton as well as Brian Burke , Davis Causey and Randall Bramblett , many of whom later worked with Gregg Allman and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band . The most influential local bands to emerge from this period included the Normaltown Flyers , and Dixie Grease . The oldest bar featuring live music in Athens is Allen 's <unk> where the Normaltown Flyers were the house band for many years . Allen 's opened in 1955 on Prince Avenue , closed for a brief time , and has since reopened on Hawthorne Ave. as part of a restoration project . Bars like The Last Resort ( currently the Last Resort Grille restaurant ) opened in the 1960s , beginning the local club scene just as some bands were beginning to gain some regional fame for Athens . 
 = = = Rock = = = 
 In the late 1970s , the 40 Watt Club became a well @-@ known regional attraction for music fans , and was followed by the Uptown Lounge ; with the local industry 's growth in the 1980s , both the 40 Watt Club and the Uptown Lounge moved to larger spaces , the latter taking over the landmark Georgia Theatre . The early 1980s saw a host of new bands and venues appear , while the city 's musical subculture became more diversified . LSD , a hallucinogenic drug , was widely used in the college music scene in this era . Many members of Athens 's most prominent later bands became locally renowned starting in the 1970s , including The B @-@ 52 's . 
 Ort 's Oldies , a used record store on Jackson Street , and its proprietor , William Orten Carlton , commonly known as Ort , were among the institutional figures that made the Athens music scene possible . Ort has an excellent memory for rock trivia , which served him well in running the store . Perhaps more importantly , his off @-@ the @-@ wall sense of humor and warmly iconoclastic personality ( and his thrift @-@ sale wardrobe ) were regularly on display at parties , gigs and musical venues around town . 
 A final element in creating and sustaining the Athens musical culture was the University of Georgia Lamar Dodd School of Art . The great majority of Athens ' musicians and their fan base were associated with the University 's liberal arts curriculum , and the School of Art , rather than the music department , was the area where the creative and musical alliances that later defined the scene began forming in the 1970s . Michael Stipe of R.E.M. was an art major ( although he did not graduate ) , and the Art School incubated other major figures such as Curtis Crowe , founding member and drummer for Pylon . The cinematographer for the documentary film Athens GA : Inside / Out was Jim Herbert , an art school professor . Herbert went on to direct music videos for a number of Athens bands , including 14 for R.E.M. 
 The B @-@ 52 's and R.E.M. became by far the most famous musical products of Athens in the 1980s , when both bands launched a string of hits . Their roots in the city 's local scene go back to the 1970s and early 1980s . The B @-@ 52 's formed after a St. Valentine 's Day party in 1977 . The members had little musical knowledge , but performed new wave music with a cheeky and humorous image and sound . They were known for their campy thrift store fashion , and their unusual and eye @-@ catching music videos for hits like " Rock Lobster " and " Love Shack " . Though the B @-@ 52 's were the first Athens band to achieve national prominence , their popularity was soon eclipsed by R.E.M .. The future members of the band R.E.M. moved to Athens to work and / or attend the University of Georgia , including bassist Mike Mills and former drummer Bill Berry . The group began performing as R.E.M. in 1980 . They became locally prominent , and released a single , " Radio Free Europe " , that was a major college rock hit . Their popularity grew with a series of singles , EPs and albums that made R.E.M. the top underground band in the country , finally breaking into the mainstream with 1987 's " The One I Love " and " It 's the End of the World as We Know It ( And I Feel Fine ) " . By 1991 's Out of Time album — which featured vocals by Kate Pierson of The B @-@ 52s — and its acclaimed follow @-@ up Automatic for the People ( named after the motto of Weaver D 's , a local Athens soul @-@ food eatery ) , R.E.M. had become one of the world 's biggest rock bands . The band 's style went through many evolutions but originally had a jangle pop sound and harmonies often compared to folk @-@ rock band The Byrds ; singer and songwriter Michael Stipe is known for obscure , allusive lyrics delivered in a monotonous drone . The success of R.E.M. and the B @-@ 52 's brought attention from major labels and music media to Athens , and many local bands received a career boost .
