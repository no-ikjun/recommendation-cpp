 = Jewett House = 
 Jewett House ( formally Milo Jewett House and formerly North Hall ) is a nine @-@ story Tudor @-@ style dormitory on the campus of Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie , New York . Built in 1907 to accommodate increasing demand for residential space , the dorm was designed by Vassar art professor Lewis Pilcher of the architectural firm Pilcher and <unk> . Early reviews looked unfavorably upon Jewett , even dubbing it " Pilcher 's Crime " and by 2002 , a host of issues plagued the dorm , leading to a $ 21 million renovation . Up to 195 students of any gender or class year may live in Jewett , which has been purported to be haunted by several different ghosts during its existence . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1902 , Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie , New York , completed Davison House , the fourth dorm in the college 's residential quadrangle ( quad ) . Enrollment was limited to 1 @,@ 000 students by 1905 and the college saw a need to further expand the number of dorms available so it approved the creation of a new one . <unk> $ 212 @,@ 500 , construction was paid for using college funds ( versus the donor funds that paid for Strong and Davison Houses ) . 
 The dormitory was known as North Hall upon its opening . However , by 1915 , the college 's semicentennial , no donor had stepped forward to help fund the dormitory 's construction and Vassar president Henry Noble MacCracken renamed the building Milo Jewett House after Milo P. Jewett . Jewett served as Vassar 's first president from his election to the office in February 1861 until his departure from the college in spring 1864 after a dispute with the school 's founder and namesake , Matthew Vassar . Although Jewett was instrumental in providing a vision for the college , the school did not open until 1865 meaning he never had the chance to oversee its student body . 
 By 2002 , Jewett hosted a spectrum of problems , highlighted in Vassar 's alumnae / i magazine as including 
 " an elevator that simply does not stop at the second floor ; balconies you can never reach ; a mezzanine @-@ level bathroom for residents of the third @-@ floor tower area , complete with stalls so squeezed that those of all heights bruise their kneecaps when they sit to use the facilities ; and a stairway tightly wrapped around a nine @-@ story elevator shaft that no longer comes close to meeting fire safety codes . " 
 The college developed a master plan in 2000 to improve campus residences and Jewett was elected as the first to undergo renovation . New Haven , Connecticut @-@ based Herbert S. Newman & Partners were selected for the 15 @-@ month project which was completed by October 2003 at a cost of $ 21 million . 
 = = Architecture and features = = 
 Lewis Pilcher of the architectural firm Pilcher and <unk> served as an art professor at Vassar between 1900 and 1911 ; his firm was responsible for the design of the house . Jewett was built at the north end of the residential quad , northwest of Lathrop House and northeast of Davison House . Later projects saw the erection of <unk> House ( 1912 ) to Jewett 's west and the Students ' Building ( 1913 ) to its east . It is the only building on the quad , including Rockefeller Hall , with its main facade facing inward . 
 The dormitory , constructed from brick and stone , consists of a four @-@ story U @-@ shaped main body with a nine @-@ story tower built ostensibly " to help campus water pressure . " Construction on the house wrapped up in 1907 . Historian Elizabeth A. Daniels notes that while Jewett 's design is " generally Tudor in spirit " , it contrasts with the rest of the dorms on the quad which are Elizabethan in style . Wooden structural support elements are minimal in the house , with the dormitory instead relying on steel and concrete . Instead of using stone for decorative exterior elements including trim and faces , as was common at the time of construction , Pilcher utilized terracotta . Other external features include a pitched copper roof with a low slope , limestone @-@ surrounded entrances , crenellations , and light red brick . According to architectural writers Karen Van Lengen and Lisa Reilly , the tower 's presence " created a more monumental and less homelike impression than that of its neighbor , <unk> " which they speculate may have earned the dorm its nickname , " Pilcher 's Crime " . 
 Upon opening , the house featured two dining rooms with student rooms arranged along lengthy hallways radiating from the center of the structure . The nine tower floors were only accessible via the ground level , from the dorm 's primary entrance hall . An exterior fire escape led down the back of Jewett 's tower but was replaced with an interior stairwell during the 2003 renovation . 
 Jewett is co @-@ ed with a capacity of 195 residents . Students of any grade may live in the house , in either single rooms , one @-@ room doubles , one @-@ room triples , two @-@ room doubles , or suites . A college guide compiled in 2003 by the staff of the Yale Daily News identified the dorm as one of the two most popular at the college , along with Cushing House . Jewett is allegedly the site of numerous hauntings . An apartment in the dorm 's east arm has been purported to be haunted by a Panama suit @-@ clad " gentleman ghost " while claims of a wailing baby 's ghost in a disused bathtub in the building have recurred throughout its history .

 = WASP @-@ 15 = 
 WASP @-@ 15 is a magnitude 11 star located about 1000 light @-@ years away in the constellation Hydra . The star , which is more massive , larger , hotter , and more luminous than the Sun , is also less metal @-@ rich than the Sun . WASP @-@ 15 has one known planet in its orbit , WASP @-@ 15b ; the planet is a Hot Jupiter with an anomalously high radius , a phenomenon which may be explained by the presence of an internal heat source . The star was first observed by the SuperWASP program in 2006 ; future measurements in 2007 and 2008 , as well as follow @-@ up observations and analysis , eventually led to the discovery of WASP @-@ 15b using the transit method and Doppler spectroscopy . 
 = = Observational history = = 
 WASP @-@ 15 was first observed by the South African Astronomical Observatory , which coordinates the planet @-@ searching SuperWASP program in the Southern Hemisphere ( WASP @-@ South ) , and was catalogued by its brightness and its coordinates in the sky . This information was captured first with one camera field between May 4 , 2006 and July 17 , 2006 , and later again using two overlapping camera fields between January 31 , 2007 to July 7 , 2007 and from January 31 , 2008 to May 29 , 2008 . 
 Data processing led to the acquisition of 24 @,@ 943 data points that suggested that some body transited , or crossed in front of ( and briefly dimmed ) , WASP @-@ 15 every 3 @.@ <unk> days . Approximately eleven transits , full and partial , were observed . Use of the <unk> photometer at the La Silla Observatory 's 1 @.@ 2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope on March 29 , 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit 's curve . Later , the CORALIE spectrograph ( also on the Euler telescope ) between March 6 , 2008 and July 17 , 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements .

 WASP @-@ 15 is an F @-@ type star with a mass that is 1 @.@ 18 times larger than the Sun , and a radius that is 1 @.@ 477 bigger .

 WASP @-@ 15 is located at a distance of 308 parsecs ( 1 @,@ 004 light years ) , and it has an estimated apparent magnitude of 10 @.@ 9 . It is , thus , not visible from Earth with the unaided eye .

WASP @-@ 15b 's large radius cannot be explained solely by its proximity to its star , suggesting that some form of tidal heating or other internal heating mechanism is also involved . 
 = Ruislip @-@ Northwood Urban District = 
 Ruislip @-@ Northwood was an urban district in west Middlesex , England , from 1904 to 1965 . From its inception Ruislip @-@ Northwood fell within the Metropolitan Police District and from 1933 it was part of the London Passenger Transport Area . 
 The urban district council presided over a huge increase in population as the Metropolitan Railway gave rise to many new development opportunities . This created many challenges to improve public services and housing while preserving the area 's heritage sites . In 1931 King 's College , Cambridge sold their final plots of land to the council , having been owners of much of the land in the manor of Ruislip since the mid @-@ 15th century . 
 The urban district was abolished in 1965 and its former area was incorporated into the newly established London Borough of Hillingdon , as part of Greater London . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Creation = = = 
 The urban district was created on 30 September 1904 , covering the parish of Ruislip , which had previously been part of Uxbridge Rural District . The parish of Ruislip included Ruislip Manor , South Ruislip , Eastcote , and Northwood . The new Urban District council held its first meeting at Northwood School on 1 October , the day after the district 's formation . 
 An urban district council had been considered a year previously , in light of the expansion of areas within the parish , particularly Northwood . A report was prepared in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood — 2 @,@ 700 by that time , with 530 houses — compared with the largely rural character of the rest of Ruislip parish . The Metropolitan Railway extension from Harrow to Uxbridge was also discussed at the meeting on 28 October 1903 , as a station was to be opened in Ruislip on the line . Kings College , Cambridge , owners of much of the land in the parish , were planning to sell some for development in light of the new line . As a result of these events , the council voted in favour of becoming an urban district . 
 = = = Governance and developments = = = 
 The urban district council consisted of nine councillors in 1904 : the Chairman William Page Edwards ; F. M. Elgood ; H. J. Brewer ; H. Ewer ; William Gregory ; S. Matheson ; Rev. Harvey Roe ; J. <unk> , and A. M. Hooper . A clerk was appointed , E. R. Abbot , for £ 100 per year . He remained in the position until 1931 . By 1920 the number of councillors had reached 15 . 
 The expansion of the Metropolitan Railway caused the district to experience a sharp rise in population — from 6 @,@ 217 in 1911 to 72 @,@ 791 in 1961 — and an increase in suburban house @-@ building , especially in the area termed Metro @-@ land . Consequentially , the district was one of the first in England to devise a statutory planning scheme in 1914 , following the Housing and Town Planning Act 1909 . The council had been prompted to follow this new act by the Chairman of the Council , Mr. Elgood , an architect , and the Clerk to the Council , Mr. Abbot . Members of the council had already raised concerns over some of the new building work around Eastcote and South Ruislip and the new development near Northwood station , which they described as " badly arranged and closely @-@ packed " . 
 Three divisions were established within the new council : Finance and General Purposes ; Public Health , Buildings and Sewerage ; and Highways . The council sought to save money from the outset ; reducing the number of workmen employed on the highways from ten to seven and cancelling the cleaning of ditches beside the roads . The lowest @-@ paid man working on the sewers was informed he would need to move within the district and take a pay cut from £ 1 : 6s to £ 1 : 3s or be made redundant . He accepted . 
 The urban district council worked with King 's College to establish plots of land for development around Ruislip and Ruislip Manor . A town planning competition was held , won by A & J Soutar , town planners from Wandsworth , who sought to create a symmetrical design spreading across Ruislip parish . Many of the woods and historic sites including Manor Farm were to be demolished and cleared as part of the plan , making way for a projected total of 7 @,@ 642 homes , enough for 35 @,@ 000 residents . Only the church in Ruislip , St. Martin 's , would have been spared . An outline map was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections . A local board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911 , which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full planning scheme to be compiled . This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914 . 
 Three roads with residential housing — Manor Way , Windmill Way , and Park Way — were completed before the outbreak of the First World War . All construction work was halted , and did not resume until 1919 . The Ruislip Manor Cottage Society had been set up in 1911 to facilitate the construction of cottages and small housing in the area , though it did not manage to build as much as had been planned . As the council took on several plots in Eastcote , only four houses could be built by the society there . In Northwood , eighteen cottages were later built in 1926 . 
 = = = Development after the First World War = = = 
 Manor Farm and the local woods were eventually saved from new developments in January 1930 , after a member of the Royal Society of Arts visited to choose the buildings that should be conserved . The Great Barn and Little Barn were singled out , together with the old Post Office , the Old Bell public house , and the Priest 's House of the local church . The woods were included in a sale by King 's College to the district in February 1931 . Park Wood was sold for £ 27 @,@ 300 , with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included as a gift to the people of Ruislip . King 's had wished to also present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College 's Act to receive payment , as it was the trustee of the land . Middlesex County Council contributed 75 per cent of the cost , as the urban district council argued that many of those who would make use of the land would be recreational day @-@ trippers from outside the district . Under a 999 @-@ year lease , the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new building was constructed without the permission of the county council . An area of the wood to the south was not included in the lease agreement and three residential roads were later constructed on it . 
 Copse Wood was purchased by Middlesex County Council and London County Council in 1936 for £ 23 @,@ 250 , joined by Mad Bess Wood in the same year . The urban district council purchased the 186 acres ( 75 ha ) wood together with Middlesex and London County Councils for £ 28 @,@ 000 in a compulsory purchase from Sir Howard Stransom Button . Sir Howard became High Sheriff of Middlesex in 1937 . 
 The council purchased Haydon Hall and its 14 @.@ 7 acres ( 5 @.@ 9 ha ) of ground in 1936 , planning to build a civic centre there . The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 caused the plan to be suspended , and it was never continued . 
 During the war , the urban district saw a high number of bombing raids by the Luftwaffe during The Blitz , between 8 September 1940 and 9 May 1941 . A total of 57 raids were recorded with 241 high explosive bombs , 2000 incendiary bombs and 4 parachuted landmines falling on the area ; 27 people were killed and a further 231 were injured . 
 A public hall was built on part of the Manor Farm site in 1965 and named Winston Churchill Hall . The land upon which it was built had been Barn Close and was bought by Councillor T. R. Parker in 1932 from King 's College . He presented the land to the Ruislip Village Trust as the site of a future public hall and the Trust gave it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating that that would be the sole use .

It also had a crest , described as " on a wreath or the colours in front of two ears of rye slipped in saltire proper a boar passant sable armed and unguled . " 
 The <unk> of trees with a representation of the Pole Star above are a play on the name Northwood . The mitre and fleurs @-@ de @-@ lys refer to the Abbey of Bec <unk> in Normandy , to whom the Lordship of Ruislip was granted , where there was a cell of the Order . The Manor was later seized by Henry V and granted as part of the endowment of King 's College , Cambridge . The Abbey and the College were dedicated to St. Mary , one of whose symbols is a fleur @-@ de @-@ lis . The ' rye slips ' are a play on the name Ruislip . The wild boar shows that the Lordship was an ancient one , granted when the land was forest roamed by wild boars .

 = Dominant white = 
 Dominant white is a group of genetically related coat color conditions in the horse , best known for producing an all @-@ white coat , but also for producing some forms of white spotting and white markings . Dominant white horses are born with unpigmented pink skin and white hair with dark eyes , although the amount of white hair or spotting can vary depending on which genetic mutation is involved . Dominant white is a rare condition , and under normal conditions , at least one parent must be dominant white to produce dominant white offspring . However , most of the currently @-@ known alleles of dominant white can be linked to a documented spontaneous mutation in a single ancestor . 
 Dominant white can occur in any breed , and has been studied in many different breeds . Two color breeds , the American White Horse and Camarillo White Horse are characterized by their dominant white coats . 
 There are many different forms of dominant white ; in genetics , as of 2013 they are labeled W1 through W20 . All known dominant white coat colors are associated with the KIT gene . As the name suggests , these known white coats are inherited dominantly , meaning that a horse only needs one copy of a W allele to have the white or white spotted coat . 
 Dominant white is genetically distinct from Sabino and both genetically and visually distinct from gray and cremello . Dominant white is not the same as lethal white syndrome , nor are dominant white horses " albinos " . <unk> has never been documented in horses . Some forms of dominant white are thought to result in nonviable embryos when a zygote has two W alleles ( is homozygous ) . However , this has not been verified for all dominant white genetic variations . 
 = = Identification = = 
 Dominant white horses are born with pink skin and a white coat , which they retain throughout their lives . Although the term " dominant white " is typically associated with a pure white coat , such horses may be all @-@ white , near @-@ white , partially white , or exhibit an irregular spotting pattern similar to that of sabino horses . The amount of white hair depends on which mutation of W is involved . Non @-@ white areas of skin and hair are most commonly seen along the dorsal midline of the horse , known as the topline , and are especially common in the mane and on the ears . They may also have interspersed specks or spots of non @-@ white skin and hair . In addition , the hooves are most often white , but may have striping if there is pigmented skin on the coronary band just above the hoof . In some cases , foals born with residual non @-@ white hair may lose some or all of this pigment with age , without the help of the gray factor . Dominant white spotting does not affect eye color , and most dominant white horses have brown eyes . The pink skin is devoid of pigment cells ( melanocytes ) , and appears pink from the underlying network of capillaries . White hair is rooted in unpigmented pink skin . There are many other genetic factors that produce white , near @-@ white , and off @-@ white coat colors in horses , some of which are visually very similar to dominant white . 
 = = Prevalence = = 
 Dominant white is one of several potential genetic causes for horses with near @-@ white or completely white coats ; it may occur through spontaneous mutation , and thus may be found unexpectedly in any breed , even those that discourage excessive white markings . To date , dominant white has been identified in multiple families of Thoroughbreds , American Quarter Horses , Frederiksborg horses , Icelandic horses , Shetland ponies , Franches Montagnes horses , South German Draft horses , and in one family of the Arabian horse . The American White Horse , which is descended primarily from one dominant white stallion crossed on non @-@ white mares , is known for its dominant white coat , as is the Camarillo White Horse . 
 = = Inheritance = = 
 The W locus was mapped to the KIT gene in 2007 . The terms " Kit oncogene " and " dominant spotting " gene , symbolized by KIT and W respectively , can be used interchangeably . Current research has now shown that there are multiple forms , or alleles , of the W gene . All horses possess the KIT gene , as it is necessary for survival even at the earliest stages of development . The presence or absence of dominant white is based on the presence of certain altered forms of KIT . Each unique form is called an allele , and for every trait , all animals inherit one allele from each parent . The original or " normal " form of KIT , which is expected in horses without dominant white spotting , is called the " wild type " allele . Thus , a dominant white horse has one KIT allele with a mutation associated with dominant white spotting , and one wild type KIT allele . 
 = = = History of dominant white research = = = 
 Dominant white horses were first described in scientific literature in 1912 . Horse breeder William P. Newell described his family of white and near @-@ white horses to researcher A. P. Sturtevant of Columbia University : 
 " The colour of skin is white or so @-@ called pink , usually with a few small dark specks in skin . Some have a great many dark spots in skin . These latter usually have a few dark stripes in hoofs ; otherwise the hoofs are almost invariably white . Those that do not have dark specks in skin usually have glass or watch eyes , otherwise dark eyes ... I have one colt coming one year old that is pure white , not a coloured speck on him , not a coloured hair on him , and with glass [ blue ] eyes . " 
 Sturtevant and his contemporaries agreed that this colt 's blue eyes were inherited separately from his white coat . In 1912 , Sturtevant assigned the " white " trait to the White or W locus . At the time there was no means of assigning W to a position on the chromosome , or to a gene . 
 This family of white horses produced Old King in 1908 , a dark @-@ eyed white stallion that was purchased by Caleb R. and Hudson B. Thompson . Old King was bred to Morgan mares to produce a breed of horse known today as the American White Horse . A grandson of Old King , Snow King , was at the center of the first major study of the dominant white coat color in horses , conducted in 1969 by Dr. William L. Pulos of Alfred University and Dr. Frederick B. Hutt of Cornell . They concluded , based on test matings and progeny phenotype ratios , that the white coat was dominantly inherited and embryonic lethal in the homozygous state . Other factors , such as variations in expressivity and the influence of multiple genes , may have influenced the progeny ratios that Pulos and Hutt observed . The white coat of the American White Horse has not yet been mapped . 
 A 1924 study by C. Wriedt identified a heritable white coat color in the Frederiksborg horse . Wriedt described a range of what he considered to be homozygote phenotypes : all @-@ white , white with pigmented flecks , or <unk> , which <unk> to " white @-@ gray . " The German term for gray horse is <unk> , not <unk> . <unk> , according to Wriedt , ranged from <unk> or diluted to more or less solid white horses . Reviewers , such as Miguel Odriozola , reinterpreted Wriedt 's data in successive years , while Pulos and Hutt felt that his work had been " erroneous " because Wriedt never concluded that white was lethal when homozygous . 
 Other researchers prior to modern DNA analysis developed remarkably prescient theories . The gene itself was first proposed and named W in 1948 . In a 1969 work on horse coat colors , A los <unk> del caballo , Miguel Odriozola suggested that various forms of dominantly inherited white spotting might be arranged sequentially along one chromosome , thus allowing for the varied expression of dominant white . He also proposed that other , distant genes might also influence the amount of white present . 
 Between the time of Pulos and Hutt 's study in 1969 and the beginning of molecular @-@ level research into dominant white in the 21st century , a pattern known as " Sabino " became regarded by some as a more likely cause of white phenotypes . Sabino is a type of white spotting , and the one allele now mapped , the dominantly inherited Sabino @-@ 1 ( SB @-@ 1 ) , is genetically related , though distinct . When homozygous , SB @-@ 1 can produce nearly all @-@ white horses that resemble dominant white . Other genes responsible for all possible patterns labeled " Sabino " have not yet been identified , though some forms of the splashed white gene may be responsible for certain patterns . 
 In 2007 , researchers from Switzerland and the United States published a paper identifying the genetic cause of dominant white spotting in horses from the Franches Montagnes horse , Camarillo White Horse , Arabian horse and Thoroughbred breeds . Each of these dominant white conditions had occurred separately and spontaneously in the past 75 years , and each represents a different allele ( variation or form ) of the same gene . These same researchers identified a further seven unique causes of dominant white in 2009 : three in distinct families of Thoroughbreds , one Icelandic horse , one Holsteiner , a large family of American Quarter Horses and a family of South German Draft horses .

 The KIT gene contains over 2000 base pairs , and a change in any of those base pairs results in a mutant allele . Over forty such alleles have been identified by sequencing the KIT genes of various horses . The resultant phenotype of most of these alleles is not yet known , but 20 have been linked to dominant white . To date , DNA tests can identify if a horse carries the various identified W alleles , some commercially available . 
 W1 is found in Franches Montagnes horses descended from a white mare named Cigale born in 1957 . Cigale 's parents ' coats were not extensively marked . A single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) , a type of mutation in which a single nucleotide is accidentally exchanged for another , is thought to have occurred with Cigale . This mutation ( <unk> > G ) is thought to severely affect the function of KIT . It is a nonsense mutation located on <unk> of KIT Some horses with the W1 mutation are born pure white , but many have residual pigment along the topline , which they may then lose over time . Based on studies of KIT mutations in mice , the severity of this mutation suggests that it may be nonviable in the homozygous state . However , horses with the W1 mutation have been found to have normal blood parameters and do not suffer from anemia . 
 W2 is found in Thoroughbred horses descended from KY Colonel , a stallion born in 1946 . While KY Colonel was described as a chestnut with extensive white markings , he is known for siring a family of pure white horses through his white daughter , White Beauty , born in 1963 . The W2 allele is also linked to a single nucleotide polymorphism ( <unk> > A ) , but it is a missense mutation located on <unk> . 
 W3 is found in Arabian horses descended from R <unk> , a near @-@ white stallion born in 1996 . Neither of his parents were white , and the causative mutation ( <unk> > T ) is thought to have originated with this horse . It is a nonsense mutation on <unk> . Horses with the W3 allele often retain interspersed flecks or regions of pigmented skin and hair , which may fade with time . Some members of this family possess blue eyes , but these are thought to be inherited separately from the white coat . Based on similar studies in mice , researchers have named W3 as potentially homozygous nonviable . 
 W4 is found in Camarillo White Horses , a breed characterized by a white coat , beginning with a spontaneous white stallion born in 1912 named Sultan . Like W1 and W3 , horses with this type of dominant white may be pure white or near @-@ white , with pigmented areas along the topline that fade with time . This mutation is also an SNP ( <unk> > T ) , a missense mutation on <unk> . 
 W5 is found in Thoroughbreds descending from <unk> , a 1984 stallion with sabino @-@ like white spotting and roaning . Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype : a few have been pure white or near @-@ white , while others have sabino @-@ like spotting limited to high , irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face . Twenty @-@ two members of this family were studied , and the 12 with some degree of dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 ( <unk> ) , in the form of a frameshift mutation . A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele . 
 W6 is found in one near @-@ white Thoroughbred born to non @-@ white parents in 2004 . The potential range of expressivity , therefore , is not yet known . The mutation ( <unk> > A ) is thought to have occurred spontaneously in this horse . It is a <unk> mutation on <unk> . 
 W7 is found in another near @-@ white Thoroughbred born in 2005 to a dam that had nine other offspring , all non @-@ white . She did not possess the W7 allele , which results from a splice site mutation ( <unk> @-@ 1G > C ) , located on <unk> of KIT . 
 W8 is found in one Icelandic horse with sabino @-@ like white spotting , mottling , and roaning . Both parents and four maternal half @-@ siblings , all non @-@ white , were found without the W8 allele . The W8 allele is also a splice site mutation ( <unk> @-@ 1G > A ) , located on <unk> . 
 <unk> is found in one all @-@ white Holsteiner horse with a single nucleotide polymorphism ( <unk> > A ) . No relatives were studied , but both parents are non @-@ white . It is a missense mutation on <unk> . 
 <unk> was found in a study of 27 horses in a family of American Quarter Horses , 10 of which are white or spotted and 17 that were solid and non @-@ white . The 10 family members with <unk> had a deletion in exon 7 ( <unk> _ <unk> ) . Like W5 , a wide range of phenotypes were observed . The most modestly marked had large amounts of white on the face and legs and some medium @-@ sized belly spots , while another was nearly all @-@ white . It is a frameshift mutation on <unk> . The founder of this line was GQ Santana , foaled in 2000 . 
 W11 is found in a family of South German Draft horses descending from a single white stallion , in which the causative mutation is thought to have originated . The mutation responsible for the W11 phenotype is a splice site mutation of intron 20 ( <unk> + 1G > A ) . 
 <unk> is found in Thoroughbreds , and is a deletion mutation found on <unk> . 
 <unk> is found in Quarter Horses , and is a splice site mutation on <unk> . 
 <unk> is a deletion mutation on <unk> , found in Thoroughbreds . 
 <unk> is found in Arabians , and is a missense mutation on <unk> . 
 <unk> is found in the <unk> and is a missense mutation on <unk> . 
 <unk> is found in a Japanese Draft horse and is a missense mutation on <unk> . 
 <unk> is a splice site mutation on <unk> ( <unk> + 1G > A ) found in a bay Swiss Warmblood with extensive speckling . Both <unk> were solid @-@ colored and had no extended head or leg markings . 
 W19 was found in three part @-@ Arabians with bald face markings , white leg markings extending above the knees and hocks , and irregular belly spots . All three horses tested negative for sabino @-@ 1 , frame overo and splashed white . W19 is a missense mutation on Exon 8 ( <unk> ; <unk> ) . This gene is predicted to be " probably damaging " and one of the three horses has solid @-@ colored offspring that do not carry the allele . 
 W20 is a missense mutation on <unk> ( <unk> > A ; <unk> ) originally discovered in 2007 but not recognized for having a subtle role in increasing white markings and white pigmentation . It appears in many breeds , but its effects were first recognized in the W5 family of Thoroughbreds and was determined to be the causative factor in the most extensively @-@ depigmented ( " white " ) horses . 
 These alleles do not account for all dominantly inherited white spotting in horses . More KIT alleles are expected to be found with roles in white spotting . Most W alleles each occur within a specific breed or family and arise as spontaneous mutations . The KIT gene itself seems prone to mutation , and so new alleles of W could occur in virtually any breed . 
 = = = Molecular genetics = = = 
 The KIT gene encodes a protein called steel factor receptor , which is critical to the differentiation of stem cells into blood cells , sperm cells , and pigment cells . A process called alternative splicing , which uses the information encoded in the KIT gene to make slightly different proteins ( isoforms ) for use in different circumstances , may impact whether a mutation on KIT affects blood cells , sperm cells , or pigment cells . Steel factor receptor interacts chemically with steel factor or stem cell factor to relay chemical messages . These messages are used during embryonic development to signal the migration of early melanocytes ( pigment cells ) from the neural crest tissue to their eventual destinations in the dermal layer . The neural crest is a transient tissue in the embryo that lies along the dorsal line . <unk> migrate along the dorsal line to a number of specific sites : near the eye , near the ear , and the top of the head ; six sites along each side of the body , and a few along the tail . At these sites , the cells undergo a few rounds of replication and differentiation , and then migrate down and around the body from the dorsal aspect towards the ventral aspect and the limb buds . 
 The timing of this migration is critical ; all white markings , from a small star to a pure white coat , are caused by the failed migration of melanocytes . 
 A certain degree of the eventual amount of white , and its " design " , is completely random . The development of an organism from single @-@ celled to fully formed is a process with many , many steps . Even beginning with identical genomes , as in clones and identical twins , the process is unlikely to occur the same way twice . A process with this element of randomness is called a stochastic process , and cell differentiation is , in part , a stochastic process . The stochastic element of development is partly responsible for the eventual appearance of white on a horse , potentially accounting for nearly a quarter of the phenotype . The research team that studied dominant white cited " subtle variations in the amount of residual KIT protein " as a potential cause for the variability in phenotype of horses with the same kind of dominant white . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Early <unk> lethality , also known as early embryonic death or a non @-@ viable embryo , may occur when the embryo possesses two dominant white alleles , or have the homozygous genotype . The reason for this is that many mutations for W are caused by nonsense mutations , frameshift mutations or DNA deletions , which , if homozygous , would make it impossible to produce a functional KIT protein . However , it is possible that homozygous embryos from alleles of missense and splice site mutations might be viable because they have less effect on gene function . A 2013 study also unearthed horses that were compound W5 / W20 heterozygotes , almost completely white , essentially with greater depigmentation than could be accounted for by either allele alone . 
 The embryonic lethality hypothesis was originally supported by Pulos and Hutt 's 1969 study of Mendelian progeny ratios . Conclusions about Mendelian traits that are controlled by a single gene can be drawn from test breedings with large sample sizes . However , traits that are controlled by allelic series or multiple loci are not Mendelian characters , and are not subject to Mendelian ratios . 
 Pulos and Hutt knew that if the allele that created a white coat was recessive , then white horses would have to be homozygous for the condition and therefore breeding white horses together would always result in a white foal . However , this did not occur in their study and they concluded that white was not recessive . Conversely , if a white coat was a simple autosomal dominant , <unk> horses would be non @-@ white , while both <unk> and WW horses would be white , and the latter would always produce white offspring . But Pulos and Hutt did not observe any white horses that always produced white offspring , suggesting that homozygous dominant ( WW ) white horses did not exist . As a result , Pulos and Hutt concluded that white was <unk> and lethal in the homozygous state : <unk> horses were non @-@ white , <unk> were white , and WW died . 
 Pulos and Hutt reported that neonatal death rates in white foals were similar to those in non @-@ white foals , and concluded that homozygous white fetuses died during gestation . No aborted fetuses were found , suggesting that death occurred early on in embryonic or fetal development and that the fetus was " resorbed . " 
 Prior to Pulos and Hutt 's work , researchers were split on the mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious ( harmful ) . Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat , so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes . It is also possible that the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt 's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes . Therefore , it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state . 
 The white ( W ) locus was first recognized in mice in 1908 . The mutation of the same name produces a belly spot and interspersed white hairs on the dorsal aspect of the coat in the heterozygote ( W / + ) and black @-@ eyed white in the homozygote ( W / W ) . While heterozygotes are healthy , homozygous W mice have severe macrocytic anemia and die within days . A mutation which affects multiple systems is " pleiotropic . " Following the mapping of the KIT gene to the W locus in 1988 , researchers began identifying other mutations as part of an allelic series of W. There are over 90 known W alleles , each representing a unique mutation on the KIT gene , which primarily produce white spotting from tiny head spots to fully white coats , macrocytic anemia from mild to lethal , and sterility . Some alleles , such as sash produce white spotting alone , while others affect the health of the animal even in the heterozygous state . <unk> encoding small amounts of white are no more likely to be linked with anemia and sterility than those encoding conspicuous white . Presently , no anecdotal or research evidence has suggested that equine KIT mutations affect health or fertility . A recent study showed that blood parameters in horses with the W1 mutation were normal . 
 = = " White " horses that are not dominant white = = 
 White horses are potent symbols in many cultures . An array of horse coat colors may be identified as " white , " often inaccurately , and many are genetically distinct from " dominant white . " 
 " Albino " horses have never been documented , despite references to so @-@ called " albino " horses . Dominant white is caused by the absence of pigment cells ( melanocytes ) , whereas albino animals have a normal distribution of melanocytes . Also , a diagnosis of albinism in humans is based on visual impairment , which has not been described in horses with dominant white nor similar coat colors . In other mammals , the diagnosis of albinism is based on the impairment of tyrosinase production through defects in the Color ( C ) gene . No mutations of the tyrosinase or C gene are known in horses . 
 = = = Non @-@ white colors = = = 
 <unk> or Blue @-@ eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin , pale blue eyes and cream @-@ colored coats , indicating that pigment cells and pigment are present in the skin , eyes , and coat , but at lower levels . Dominant white horses do not have pigment cells , and thus no pigment , in the skin or coat . In addition , dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes . Other genetic factors , or combinations of genetic factors , such as the pearl gene or champagne gene , can also produce cremello @-@ like coats . These coat colors may be distinguishable from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes . 
 Gray horses are born any color and progressively replace their colored coat with gray and white hairs . Most gray horses have dark skin , unless they happen to also carry genes for pink or unpigmented skin . Unlike dominant white horses , grays are not born white , nor is their skin color affected by their coat color change . 
 Leopard complex horses , such as the Appaloosa and Knabstrupper breeds , are genetically quite distinct from all other white spotting patterns . The <unk> leopard pattern , however , can resemble white . Two factors influence the eventual appearance of a leopard complex coat : whether one copy or two copies of the Leopard alleles are present , and the degree of dense leopard @-@ associated white patterning that is present at birth . If a foal is homozygous for the LP allele and has extensive dense white patterning , they will appear nearly white at birth , and may continue to lighten with age . In other parts of the world , these horses are called " white born . " " White born " foals are less common among Appaloosa horses , which tend to have blankets and varnish <unk> , than <unk> or <unk> , which tend to be full leopards . 
 <unk> , Medicine hat or War bonnet are terms sometimes applied to Pinto horses with residual non @-@ white areas only around the head , especially the ears and poll , while most the remaining of the coat is white . While dominant white horses may have areas of residual pigment only around the ears and poll , the term " medicine hat " usually refers to horses with more commonly known white spotting genes , most often tobiano , combined with frame overo , sabino or splashed white . 
 = = = Lethal White = = = 
 Foals with Lethal white syndrome ( LWS ) have two copies of the Frame overo gene and are born with white or nearly white coats and pink skin . However , unlike dominant white horses , foals with LWS are born with an underdeveloped colon that is untreatable , and if not euthanized , invariably die of colic within a few days of birth . Horses that carry only one allele of the LWS gene are healthy and typically exhibit the " frame overo " spotting pattern . In cases of " solid " horses with frame overo ancestry , uncertain " overo " ( non @-@ tobiano ) phenotype , or horses with multiple patterns , the LWS allele can be detected by DNA test . 
 = = = Sabino = = = 
 Both dominant white and " Sabino @-@ White " horses are identified by all @-@ white or near @-@ white coats with underlying pink skin and dark eyes , often with residual pigment along the dorsal midline . However , there are genetic differences . The term " dominant white " is reserved for known W alleles . Dominant white horses are heterozygous for any one of 11 known alleles of the KIT gene ( e.g. W8 / + ) . <unk> for some of the 11 known alleles may not create a viable embryo . In contrast , Sabino @-@ White horses are homozygous for the Sabino 1 allele of the KIT gene ( SB1 / SB1 ) . 
 Another type of sabino patterning , called simply " sabino , " " minimal sabino " if slight , or if particularly dramatic , " maximum sabino , " refers to horses that test negative for any of the Dominant White alleles , negative for Sabino 1 , and also negative for <unk> and Frame overo . Initially , dominant white was separated from sabino on the grounds that the former had to be entirely white , while the latter could possess some pigment . However , the 2007 and 2009 studies of dominant white showed that many dominant white alleles produce a range of white phenotypes that include horses with pigmented spots in hair and skin . Each of the larger families of dominant white studied included pure @-@ white horses , horses described as having " sabino @-@ like " white markings , as well as white horses described as " maximal sabino . " 
 More recently , dominant white and sabino were distinguished from one another on the grounds that dominant white alleles produce nonviable embryos in the homozygous state , while Sabino 1 was viable when homozygous . However , not all KIT alleles currently identified as " dominant white " have been proven lethal . 
 The similarities between Dominant White , Sabino 1 , and other forms of sabino may reflect their common molecular origin : The W1 @-@ W11 series and SB1 have been mapped to KIT . The researchers who mapped Sabino 1 suggested that other sabino @-@ like patterns might also map to KIT . Similarly , major alleles for white leg and facial markings have also been mapped to or near to the KIT gene . 
 = = = Mosaicism = = = 
 Mosaicism in horses is thought to account for some spontaneous occurrences of white , near @-@ white , spotted , and roan horses . Mosaicism refers to mutations that occur after the single @-@ cell stage , and therefore affect only a portion of the adult cells . Mosaicism may be one possible cause for the rare occurrence of brindle coloring in horses . Mosaic @-@ white horses would be visually indistinguishable from dominant whites . Mosaicism could produce white or partially white foals if a stem cell in the developing foal underwent a mutation , or change to the DNA , that resulted in unpigmented skin and hair . The cells that descend from the affected stem cell will exhibit the mutation , while the rest of the cells are unaffected . 
 A mosaic mutation may or may not be inheritable , depending on the cell populations affected . Though this is not always the case , genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis . In these cases , called germline mutations , the mutation will be present in the single @-@ celled zygote conceived from the affected sperm or egg cell , and the condition can be inherited by the next generation . 
 = = Homologous conditions = = 
 In humans , a skin condition called <unk> is caused by more than a dozen distinct mutations in the KIT gene . <unk> in humans is characterized by a white forelock , and <unk> patches of skin on the forehead , brow , face , ventral trunk and extremities . Outside of pigmentation , <unk> is an otherwise benign condition . In pigs , the " patch , " " belted , " and commercial " white " colors are caused by mutations on the KIT gene . The best @-@ known model for KIT gene function is the mouse , in which over 90 alleles have been described . The various alleles produce everything from white toes and blazes to black @-@ eyed white mice , panda @-@ white to sashed and belted . Many of these alleles are lethal in the homozygous state , lethal when combined , or sublethal due to anemia . Male mice with KIT mutations are often sterile . To date , no such pleiotropic effects have been described in horses with KIT mutations .

 How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a 2006 album by Chris Thile and the How to Grow a Band , credited to Chris Thile . It was released on Sugar Hill on September 12 , 2006 . The album is named after a song on the album ; a cover of the original by folk singer Tom Brosseau . 
 The album debuted to positive reviews from major music critics , with critics calling the album “ fantastic , eclectic ” , and “ genius ” . The album earned Thile a Grammy Award @-@ nomination in 2006 . 
 = = Conception and production = = 
 For one of his side projects , Chris Thile knew he wanted to form a string quintet composed of mandolin , violin , banjo , guitar , and bass with childhood friend and fiddler Gabe Witcher , but didn ’ t know which direction he wanted to take the band . At the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Telluride , Colorado , Thile met banjoist Noam Pikelny and later commented that “ every note he played was something I wish I ’ d played ” . It was then that Thile realized that he wanted to “ put [ his ] stamp on the traditional bluegrass ensemble ” . Thile wanted to get five musicians together for a Nashville jam session in 2005 , after he found talented bluegrass musicians that could fill the positions . The bassist Thile was searching for , Greg Garrison , was recommended to Thile by Pikelny , who had performed alongside Garrison in the Cajun jam band Leftover Salmon . The guitar position was filled by Chris Eldridge , from the bluegrass band the Infamous <unk> . The five musicians met up in Nashville one day in 2005 and decided that they needed to “ do something musical together ” . A few nights later , the group met again “ just to drop a ton of money , drink too much wine , eat steaks , and commiserate about our failed relationships ” . That night , they came to an agreement and formed a bluegrass band . 
 The quintet decided to make this project serious and record an album . The album was recorded over the course of two days in 2006 at Sear Sound Recording Studios in New York . The album was not recorded digitally , but rather on tape . In an interview with the United States magazine Guitar Player , Chris Thile explained the old fashioned style in which the album was recorded : 
 It was recorded at Sear Sound in New York using two vintage Telefunken <unk> M 251 E mics into a Forsell Technologies <unk> preamp . Most of it was recorded onto the same Studer 1 " two @-@ track that was used to mix Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ! Everything was tracked live , and I ’ ve decided never to record wearing headphones again unless I absolutely have to . Wearing headphones is bullshit , because you ’ re in your own little world playing to a mix that no one will ever hear but you . What ’ s the point ? 
 How to Grow a Woman from the Ground was self produced by Thile , and had no guest musicians , just the quintet . Other than the band , which in promotion of the album was named the How to Grow a Band , the album had a fairly small production crew ; an engineer , an assistant engineer , two mastering people , and an artist . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 How to Grow a Woman from the Ground takes influence from different genres , “ drawing equally from traditional bluegrass , progressive acoustic , and singer / songwriter traditions ” , with one critic calling the majority of the album very “ roots oriented ” . The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core ; bluegrass <unk> Ronnie McCoury became the album ’ s official “ bluegrass guru ” to ensure that there was “ someone who could make sure we didn ’ t do anything clichéd or trite ” . In regard to the album ’ s style , Thile said that “ All in all , How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record . There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary , but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me . It ’ s not all like “ Brakeman ’ s Blues , ” but “ Brakeman ’ s Blues ” doesn ’ t sound out of place , and neither does “ The <unk> ” sound out of place . It ’ s all related . ” Much of Thile 's work on the album was influenced by his divorce , and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album , a Tom Brosseau song . Thile said that he " got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in . This girl just left . It created a pretty serious complex for me . I ’ ve always been able to talk to girls , but I ’ m scared of them . I just could relate to it . Like , man if I could just grow one , that would take care of a lot of problems . "

 How to Grow a Woman from the Ground received positive reviews from country and bluegrass music critics . Allmusic called it " fantastic " , and <unk> described it to be " a tasteful string dinner " and stated that " this is only the beginning of great things to come " . However , some critics found particular tracks to pale in comparison to the rest of the material . The Arizona Republic stated that the album was " amazing " , except for " Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground " because " Thile [ couldn 't ] quite match Jack White 's musical hysteria " . Music Box also said that tracks like " Stay Away " and " I ’ m Yours If You Want Me " " completely fell flat " . Regardless , the review still stated that " the bulk of How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is remarkably engaging " . Bullz @-@ Eye criticized Thile 's vocal quality , saying that " his voice often lacks the strength and / or character to carry the song " . On the contrary , the previously mentioned <unk> article complimented Thile 's vocal strength , saying " it 's the soul in Thile 's voice and the heart and intensity of the musicianship that give the album its power .

 Ochetellus is a genus of ants first described by Steve Shattuck in 1992 . He placed it in the subfamily Dolichoderinae of the family Formicidae . The ants in this genus are small and black in colour ; workers measure 1 @.@ 75 to 3 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 07 to 0 @.@ 12 in ) in length , the males at around 1 @.@ 6 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 06 in ) are smaller , and the queens are the largest , reaching 4 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) . There are seven described species and three described subspecies that mostly live in Australia in a wide variety of habitats , but some species are found in Asia . One species , Ochetellus glaber , has been introduced into New Zealand and the United States . 
 The colonies are found in rotten wood , in the ground , under rocks or stones and in urban areas . The ants are both diurnal and nocturnal and forage on trees , in low vegetation and into human homes , where they are regarded as pests . These ants eat a variety of foods , including fruits , insects , sucrose , nectar and bird feces . They visit various flowers and attend to a variety of butterfly larvae . The thorny devil , an Australian lizard , predominantly feeds on Ochetellus workers , and other ant species also prey on them . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The genus Ochetellus was first described by Steve Shattuck in 1992 , placing it in the subfamily Dolichoderinae . The type species of the genus is Ochetellus glaber , originally described as Hypoclinea glabra by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862 . The genus was originally placed in the tribe <unk> . It was later placed under the tribe <unk> , now classified as a synonym for the tribe <unk> . 
 The genus consists of seven species and three subspecies that were previously placed in the genus Iridomyrmex . The genus contains the following species : O. <unk> , O. <unk> , O. flavipes , O. glaber , O. <unk> , O. <unk> and O. <unk> . The three subspecies classified in this genus are O. glaber <unk> , O. glaber <unk> and O. glaber <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 <unk> is a genus of small black ants ; each species vary in size , with workers ranging from 1 @.@ 75 to 3 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 07 to 0 @.@ 12 in ) in length and males are smaller at 1 @.@ 6 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 06 in ) . The largest ants in the genus are the queens ; Ochetellus <unk> queens measure up to 4 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) . While these ants were formerly placed in the genus Iridomyrmex , there are several features that makes these ants distinct ; the compound eyes are differently positioned on the head , and the arrangement of the clypeal margin and mesosoma can also distinguish between the two genera . Ochetellus looks similar to Dolichoderus species , but they are relatively smaller and the petiole is narrow and <unk> expanded . The head is also thinner than most Dolichoderinae ants . 
 On the head , the occipital border either curves in or curves out , and no ocelli are present . The antennae consist of twelve segments . The mandibles each have six to eight teeth along with a large apical tooth . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Ochetellus ants are native to Australia and have been introduced into New Zealand . In Asia , they are native to India , Japan , the Philippines and southern Burma . Species are found on the islands of Fiji , Mauritius and New Caledonia . Ochetellus glaber was first sighted in Hawaii in 1977 and is considered an invasive species . Since its introduction , the ant has spread throughout the state , and is now found in Hawaii , Kahoolawe , Kauai , Maui and Oahu . The ant has also been introduced to mainland United States , being found in north @-@ central Florida , where it is localised in Orange County . 
 Ants of this genus are <unk> ; they have a widespread geographic distribution in many different climates , but they are usually found in dry and mesic habitats . They are referred to as a tropical genus , but the type specimen was collected from temperate Sydney . They are found in sclerophyll woodland and forests , eucalypt woodland , Casuarina forests , mallee , hillsides , beaches and urban areas . These ants are arboreal ants and nests are located in bark , logs , rotten wood , sand , soil , under rocks and stones , tree stumps and twigs or branches . In urban areas , colonies are found under cracked paths , inside house walls or in patio areas . Some species are considered pests , and they forage into pastures and houses where they show a preference for fluids and sweets . Ochetellus flavipes nesting habits are unique among Australian ants , and they construct small runways across the ground . These nests are structurally similar to nests built by some Polyrhachis ants , which construct platforms woven from plants that house the Hemiptera insects they attend to . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 Workers form foraging columns in search of food . They forage into buildings , eucalyptus trees , ground areas or on low vegetation . Workers are both diurnal and nocturnal , but they are not active throughout any 24 @-@ hour period . Low activity occurs during clear sunny days ; however , colonies are extremely active shortly after rain . 
 Ochetellus ants are omnivores that feed primarily on arthropods , but they show a preference for fluids and sweets when they enter human houses . Workers will prey on <unk> <unk> eggs , fruit fly pupae , <unk> larvae and attack wasp nests . Honeydew , nectar , Pacific reef heron feces , carrion , Pandanus fruits , plants , seeds , sucrose , fats and grease will also be consumed . O. glaber is known to exploit the extrafloral nectaries on plants without providing protection . 
 Foraging workers often visit Pisonia flowers and will feed on the nectar . Other flowers they will visit include Canavalia , <unk> , Ipomoea , <unk> , Plumbago and Scaevola . Ochetellus flavipes regularly attends the mealybug <unk> <unk> and protects it by building shelters . They also attend a number of butterfly larvae , including <unk> <unk> ( Pale <unk> Blue ) , Ogyris amaryllis ( Satin Azure ) , Ogyris olane ( <unk> Azure ) and Ogyris <unk> ( Silky Azure ) . 
 Predators such as other ants and the thorny devil lizard ( Moloch horridus ) predominantly feed on Ochetellus workers ; the number of ants that a thorny devil can consume per minute is around 24 to 45 . The total number of ants consumed in a day can be as many as 2 @,@ 500 individuals , based on an examination of the lizard 's stomach contents . 
 During the nuptial flight , a queen may mate with multiple males , while the males will only mate with a single queen , making them monogynous . However , Ochetellus glaber queens will only mate with a single male , making them polygynous . Sometimes , colonies proliferate by " budding " ( also called " satelliting " or " fractionating " ) , where a subset of the colony including queens , workers and brood ( eggs , larvae and pupae ) leave the main colony for an alternative nest site . 
 = Portland @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Portland @-@ class of heavy cruisers was a class of ships designed and constructed by the United States Navy in 1930 . The two ships of the class , USS Portland ( CA @-@ 33 ) and USS Indianapolis ( CA @-@ 35 ) saw extensive service during the Pacific War in World War II . 
 Designed as a modification over the previous Northampton class cruiser , the Portland @-@ class displaced just under 10 @,@ 000 long tons ( 10 @,@ 000 t ) and featured heavier armor and armament than previous cruisers . Featuring 8 " / 55 caliber guns and designed to function as fleet flagships , the Portland @-@ class were intended to fix problems with armament and armor that had been a weakness of preceding U.S. cruisers . These designs were carried over to the following New Orleans class , of which several Portland cruisers were converted to mid @-@ construction . 
 Portland served in a large number of engagements including the Battle of Coral Sea , the Battle of Midway and the Guadalcanal Campaign , where she was severely damaged but nonetheless able to return to service . She later fought in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the Battle of Okinawa . Indianapolis served as a fleet flagship for much of the war and fought in the Battle of Philippine Sea and the Battle of Iwo Jima . On 30 July 1945 , after transporting components for the nuclear weapons Little Boy and Fat Man from the United States , she was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine I @-@ 58 . Due to a series of errors and miscommunications her loss was not discovered for several days , and only 316 of her 1 @,@ 116 crew survived . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Portland @-@ class was the third class of heavy cruiser to be constructed by the United States Navy following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 . The first " treaty cruisers " were the two of the Pensacola @-@ class ordered in 1926 , which emphasized armament and speed at the expense of protection . These ships were followed by the six vessels of the Northampton @-@ class ordered in 1927 which were more heavily armed , and introduced the configuration of three triple turrets which would become standard on U.S. Navy heavy cruisers . The Portland @-@ class was a modification of both the Pensacola and Northampton designs . 
 Ordered for the U.S. Navy in fiscal year 1930 , the Portland @-@ class was originally designated as a light cruiser , and given the hull classification symbol CL , being re @-@ designated a heavy cruiser with the symbol CA on 1 July 1931 , due to their armament , in accordance with the London Naval Treaty . Originally , eight cruisers were envisioned as modified Northampton @-@ class vessels , but eventually two of these became the Portland @-@ class , with the remaining six eventually being further modified into the succeeding New Orleans @-@ class . 
 = = Design = = 
 As built , the Portland @-@ class cruisers were to be 610 feet 3 inches ( 186 @.@ 00 m ) in length overall , 592 feet ( 180 m ) long at the waterline , 64 feet 6 inches ( 19 @.@ 66 m ) abeam , and with a draft of 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) , and 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) maximum . They were designed for a standard displacement of 10 @,@ 258 tonnes ( 10 @,@ 096 long tons ; 11 @,@ 308 short tons ) , and a full @-@ load displacement of 12 @,@ 755 tonnes ( 12 @,@ 554 long tons ; 14 @,@ 060 short tons ) . However , neither completed ship reached this weight , displacing 9 @,@ 800 tonnes ( 9 @,@ 600 long tons ; 10 @,@ 800 short tons ) and 9 @,@ 950 tonnes ( 9 @,@ 790 long tons ; 10 @,@ 970 short tons ) , respectively . The ships featured two distinctive raked funnels , a tripod foremast , and a small tower and pole mast aft . In 1943 , light tripods were added forward of the second funnel on each ship , and a prominent Naval director was installed aft . 
 The ships were equipped with four propeller shafts and four Parsons GT geared turbines and eight Yarrow boilers . The power plant of the ships generated 107 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 80 @,@ 000 kW ) and the ships had a design speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ) The ships were designed for a range of 10 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 19 @,@ 000 km ; 12 @,@ 000 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ) . Both completed ships rolled badly until fitted with bilge keels . 
 The cruisers were armed with a main battery of nine Mark 9 8 " / 55 caliber guns arrayed in three triple mounts , a superfiring pair fore and one aft . For anti @-@ aircraft defense , they were armed with eight 5 " / 25 caliber guns as well as two QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns . In 1945 , the anti @-@ aircraft defenses of both ships were upgraded , with each receiving twenty four Bofors 40 mm guns . On Portland these were arranged in four quad mounts and four twin mounts , and on Indianapolis they were arrayed in six quad mounts . Both ships were also upgraded with twelve Oerlikon 20 mm cannons . No torpedo tubes were fitted on either ship of the class . The ships were outfitted with Mk . 8 rangekeepers and Mk . 27 directors which also housed auxiliary Mk . VII rangekeepers . 
 The Portland @-@ class was originally designed with 1 inch ( 25 mm ) of deck protection and 1 inch ( 25 mm ) of side protection , but during construction they were substantially up @-@ armored . The ships were completed with belt armor 5 inches ( 130 mm ) thick over the magazines and 3 @.@ 25 inches ( 83 mm ) elsewhere . Armored bulkheads were between 2 inches ( 51 mm ) and 5 @.@ 75 inches ( 146 mm ) , deck armor was 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) , the barbettes were 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) , the gunhouses were 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) , and the conning tower was 1 @.@ 25 inches ( 32 mm ) . 
 Additionally , the Portland @-@ class cruisers were designed with space to be outfitted as fleet flagships , with space for an Admiral and his staff to operate . The class also featured an aircraft catapult amidships . They could carry four aircraft . The total crew complement varied , with a regular designed crew complement of 807 , a wartime complement of 952 , which could increase to 1 @,@ 229 when the cruiser was operating as a fleet flagship . 
 = = = Comparison with previous cruiser designs = = = 
 The Portland @-@ class was generally longer than the Northampton @-@ class by about 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) and featured a revised bow shape . They were otherwise generally similar to the Northampton @-@ class , with an extended forecastle to improve sea @-@ keeping abilities . Their masts were reduced as compared to the Northampton @-@ class in order to reduce top weight . 
 When completed , the Pensacola @-@ class displaced less than expected , at 9 @,@ 100 tonnes ( 9 @,@ 000 long tons ; 10 @,@ 000 short tons ) , which was 1 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 980 long tons ; 1 @,@ 100 short tons ) less than expected , and were found to be greatly deficient in their protection . For the following Northampton @-@ class , the armor protection was increased to 1 @,@ 057 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 040 long tons ; 1 @,@ 165 short tons ) with 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armor along the main belt . Still , these ships only displaced between 9 @,@ 050 tonnes ( 8 @,@ 910 long tons ; 9 @,@ 980 short tons ) and 9 @,@ 300 tonnes ( 9 @,@ 200 long tons ; 10 @,@ 300 short tons ) While the Portland @-@ class cruisers were more heavily armored than the preceding classes , this problem was found to be so significant that in fiscal year 1929 , an entirely different design was formulated for a new class of cruisers , the New Orleans @-@ class . Several of the Portland hulls were then converted to New Orleans hulls during construction . 
 The Portland @-@ class were also designed with more advanced armament in mind . Their main guns were the first to be specially designed to fire long @-@ point projectiles with a streamlined shape , which increased the guns ' range when compared with older cruiser guns . Such projectiles were in use by ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy , which until that point out @-@ ranged U.S. cruisers with their firepower . The New Orleans @-@ class was designed with these lessons in mind , intended to create a better balance between protection , armament and speed .

 Portland was the first ship on the scene when the airship Akron went down in 1933 , and coordinated efforts to retrieve survivors . She conducted a number of fleet maneuvers and goodwill missions throughout the Pacific Ocean . After the start of World War II , Portland took part in the Battle of Coral Sea , there rescuing 722 survivors from the sunk aircraft carrier Lexington . She then fought at the Battle of Midway , the Battle of the Eastern Solomons , and in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands , where she was hit by three dud air @-@ launched torpedoes . She then supported U.S. Marine landings during the Battle of Guadalcanal . During the naval battle there in late 1942 , she was struck and severely damaged by a torpedo from a Japanese destroyer , a hit which required interim repairs in Australia followed by extensive repairs at Mare Island Navy Yard . In spite of this damage , she was still able to inflict damage on the Japanese battleship Hiei . 
 Returning to the war , she bombarded Kiska as part of the Aleutian Islands campaign , played a supporting role in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign , covered landings during the New Guinea campaign , and <unk> . She then participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf , covered landings in the Philippines , and supported the Battle of Okinawa . At the end of the war she was decommissioned and remained in the United States Reserve Fleet until 1959 , when she was broken up for scrap .

 In mid @-@ 1945 , she sailed from the United States to Tinian Island carrying components of Little Boy and Fat Man , the two nuclear weapons which would later be used to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Sailing for Leyte unescorted under Captain Charles B. McVay III , she was sunk by Japanese submarine I @-@ 58 on 30 July 1945 , sinking in just 12 minutes .

 Bootham Crescent is an association football ground in York , North Yorkshire , England , and is the home of York City Football Club . With a capacity of 8 @,@ 256 , the ground is located near the centre of the city , just over a mile from York railway station . 
 York City leased land at Bootham Crescent from York Cricket Club as a replacement for their ground at Fulfordgate , which was on the outskirts of the city . The ground was constructed in four months , and officially opened on 31 August 1932 . During the Second World War , the Popular Stand was converted into an air @-@ raid shelter , and the ground suffered slight damage when a bomb landed on houses along the Shipton Street End . York purchased Bootham Crescent for £ 4 @,@ 075 in September 1948 . Floodlights were fitted at the ground in 1959 , and were replaced by ones twice as powerful in 1995 . A number of improvements were made in the early 1980s , with a gymnasium , offices and a lounge for officials built . 
 The David Longhurst Stand opened in 1991 after a roof was erected on the Shipton Street End . It was named after the former York player David Longhurst , who died during a match at the ground in 1990 . Bootham Crescent hosted football in the Football League from 1932 to 2004 , when York were relegated into the Conference National , and has done so again since York 's promotion back into the Football League in 2012 . The ground was renamed KitKat Crescent from 2005 to 2010 as part of a sponsorship deal with Nestlé . York are expected to move to a community stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington in early 2018 , and the Bootham Crescent site will be used for housing . 
 Bootham Crescent comprises four stands : the Main Stand , the Popular Stand , the David Longhurst Stand and the Grosvenor Road End . The ground has held a league representative match , neutral club matches , and schoolboy and youth international matches . Other than football , it has hosted a concert , a grand firework display , American football and rugby league matches and beer festivals . The record attendance of 28 @,@ 123 was set in March 1938 , for an FA Cup match against Huddersfield Town . The highest seasonal average attendance of 10 @,@ 412 was achieved in 1948 – 49 .

 York City F.C. played at Fulfordgate in Fulford , on the southern outskirts of York , from 1922 to 1932 . It was difficult for most supporters to reach , being a good distance from the railway station , and the tram service to Fulford only had a single track . Attendances declined in the club 's second and third seasons in the Football League , which the directors blamed on Fulfordgate 's location . One director , G. W. Halliday , became convinced that the only solution was to move to a new ground . York Cricket Club left Bootham Crescent , their home for around fifty years , for a new ground at Wigginton Road in January 1932 . Preliminary discussions and visits to Bootham Crescent took place , and the directors believed that renting the ground would be cheaper than repaying the debts on Fulfordgate . Further , Bootham Crescent was situated near the centre of the city , and the population living within a mile of the site was , at 30 @,@ 000 , ten times that within a similar radius of Fulfordgate . However , two former directors argued that attendances at many grounds had fallen during the Great Depression , and that the approaches and surrounds to Bootham Crescent were limited . 
 The directors were unanimous that a change should be made , and a special meeting of the shareholders was held on 26 April 1932 . The move to Bootham Crescent on a 21 @-@ year lease was approved by 115 votes to 37 . The site of York 's new home was of an irregular shape and was hemmed in from four sides , with a narrow track to the south , barracks to the west , a school and <unk> to the north and terraced houses to the east . Nonetheless , the grounds of the city 's football , cricket and rugby league teams were now within a few hundred yards of each other . The ground was renovated over the summer of 1932 ; the area was drained and then built to the design of local architects Ward & <unk> . The Popular Stand was erected on the west side using sections of the terrace cover at Fulfordgate , with the Main Stand built opposite . Terraces were banked up in the wedge @-@ shaped areas behind the goals . After four months of construction , Bootham Crescent was ready for the 1932 – 33 season , with an initial capacity of over 30 @,@ 000 . 
 The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932 , when York played Stockport County in a Third Division North match . The club president , Sir John Hunt , marked the occasion by cutting a ribbon of the club 's colours of chocolate and cream . In attendance were the Lord Mayor of York , the Sheriff of York , the vice @-@ president of the Football League , the treasurer of the Football Association ( FA ) and the local Member of Parliament . York player Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground in a 2 – 2 draw , played before 8 @,@ 106 supporters . In the first four seasons at Bootham Crescent , attendances were not higher , and were sometimes lower than at Fulfordgate . There were problems with the ground in its early years ; the quality of the pitch was questioned , and the Lincolnshire Echo remarked in April 1937 that the pitch was " almost a morass , with extensive pools of water in front of the goals " . There was an incident in March 1934 where the referee and linesmen were found unconscious in their dressing room , due to fumes from a faulty heater .

 The ground first hosted a match against First Division opposition on 12 January 1935 when York played Derby County in an FA Cup third @-@ round match , which set a new club record attendance of 13 @,@ 612 . Attendance records were set at four successive stages of the 1937 – 38 FA Cup , culminating in the 28 @,@ 123 attendance for the sixth @-@ round match against Huddersfield Town on 5 March 1938 . By now the ground 's capacity was around 23 @,@ 000 , and seats were placed around the pitch to accommodate more fans . During the Second World War , the tunnel at the back of the Popular Stand was used as an air @-@ raid shelter for pupils and staff of Shipton Street School . The ground was slightly damaged after the air @-@ raid on York in April 1942 , when houses along the Shipton Street End were bombed . Considerable improvements were made in the immediate post @-@ war period . Deeper drainage and the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End were completed , and <unk> equipment was installed . 
 It was announced at the shareholders ' annual meeting in September 1948 that York had purchased Bootham Crescent for £ 4 @,@ 075 , with the club 's finances in a strong position at the time . Bigger crowds were recorded around the country in the post @-@ war period , and York achieved five @-@ figure average attendances in 1948 – 49 and 1955 – 56 . Over the late 1940s and early 1950s , concreting was completed on the terracing in the Popular Stand , due to the efforts of the supporters ' club , and the Shipton Street End . York reached the semi @-@ final of the 1954 – 55 FA Cup , and two matches from this run were played at Bootham Crescent : the first @-@ round match against Scarborough , which York won 3 – 2 , and the fifth @-@ round match against Tottenham Hotspur , which was won 3 – 1 before a crowd of 21 @,@ 000 . During the summer of 1955 the Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street , funded by profits gained from the FA Cup run and a stand extension fund . 
 A concrete wall was built at the Grosvenor Road End for over £ 3 @,@ 000 in 1956 , as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing . These improvements saw capacity extended to 23 @,@ 600 . Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at the ground in 1957 – 58 : Birmingham City were beaten 3 – 0 , followed by a 0 – 0 draw with Bolton Wanderers , which drew a capacity crowd of 23 @,@ 600 . Floodlights were installed at the ground in the summer of 1959 , costing £ 14 @,@ 500 , a substantial part of which was raised by a supporters ' club . They were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959 , which Newcastle won 8 – 2 before a crowd of 9 @,@ 414 .

 York reached the quarter @-@ final of the 1961 – 62 League Cup , and in the earlier rounds beat Bristol City , Leicester City , Watford and Bournemouth at Bootham Crescent . The half @-@ time scoreboard at the Shipton Street End ceased to be used by 1965 , but remained as advertising boarding . On 5 May 1969 , referee Roy Harper collapsed and died on the pitch during a match against Halifax Town . Seats were installed in the Popular Stand for 1974 – 75 , York 's first season in the Second Division . This increased the ground 's seating capacity to 2 @,@ 762 , but meant the overall capacity was reduced to 16 @,@ 529 . The floodlights were updated and improved for £ 20 @,@ 000 , and were officially switched on by former Wolverhampton Wanderers player Derek Dougan for a friendly with Grimsby Town on 1 August 1980 . A gymnasium was built at the Grosvenor Road End for £ 50 @,@ 000 early in 1981 , and to help towards this York received £ 15 @,@ 000 from the Sports Council and £ 20 @,@ 000 from the Football League Improvement Trust . In the summer of 1983 new offices for the manager , secretary , matchday and lottery manager were built , along with a vice @-@ presidents ' lounge . The lounge was officially opened by Jack Dunnett , the chairman of the Football League , prior to a match against Wrexham in November 1983 . 
 By the early 1980s cracks had appeared in the wall built at the back of the Grosvenor Road End . The rear of the terracing was cordoned off , and the capacity of the ground reduced to under 13 @,@ 500 . The Grosvenor Road End was segregated and allocated to away supporters , and fencing was erected for the first time before the FA Cup match against Liverpool in February 1985 . All the fencing had been dismantled by the early 2000s . During the 1983 – 84 and 1984 – 85 seasons problems had arisen in handling big crowds , due to the ground having only two of four sides available for entry and exit , and the home supporters funnelling through the car park to the Shipton Street End . Extensive improvements were made in the summer of 1985 for approximately £ 100 @,@ 000 , and eight new turnstiles were installed at the Shipton Street End . Further , the dressing rooms were refurbished to incorporate new baths and showers , and a new referees ' changing room and physiotherapist 's treatment room were readied . Hospitality boxes were built into the Main Stand during 1986 – 87 , and video equipment was installed inside the ground . Crash barriers were strengthened , meaning ground safety requirements were met . These improvements meant that shortly before the Taylor Report was published , the ground 's capacity was 14 @,@ 109 , including 3 @,@ 059 seats . However , by September 1989 the capacity had been increased to 14 @,@ 628 . 
 The ground 's major drawback was the lack of covered standing accommodation at the Shipton Street End , but the cost of erecting a stand had been prohibitive . The Shipton Street Roof Appeal was launched in the spring of 1988 to raise money for a stand , and fundraising schemes were put into place . On 8 September 1990 York player David Longhurst collapsed and died from heart failure during a match against Lincoln City at Bootham Crescent . With the approval of his family , the David Longhurst Memorial Fund was launched , and all donations were added to the monies already raised for the roof appeal . The Football Trust contributed half of the £ 150 @,@ 000 cost of the stand , and it was constructed in the summer of 1991 . The David Longhurst Stand was officially opened on 14 October 1991 in a friendly match against Leeds United , which was watched by a crowd of 4 @,@ 374 . 
 = = = 1990s to present = = = 
 The Family Stand was opened in the Main Stand in 1992 , and manager John Ward ran the London Marathon to help raise funds for the project . Bootham Crescent first hosted a play @-@ off match when York beat Bury 1 – 0 on 19 May 1993 in the Third Division play @-@ off semi @-@ final ; the attendance of 9 @,@ 206 was the ground 's highest in seven years . During 1993 – 94 the Main Stand paddock was seated and covered , and the recent work to the stand cost £ 220 @,@ 000 . The ground 's capacity fell to 9 @,@ 459 , including seating for 3 @,@ 645 , after the renovations to the David Longhurst and Main Stands . In May 1995 a new drainage system was installed for £ 11 @,@ 000 , to improve the quality of the pitch during winter . New floodlights were installed in June 1995 at a cost of £ 122 @,@ 000 , and despite being shorter in height were twice as powerful as the original floodlights . A water tower was installed in the late 1990s , to further help the pitch quality . 
 In July 1999 York 's real property assets , including Bootham Crescent , were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings ( BCH ) for £ 165 @,@ 000 . Chairman Douglas Craig put the ground and the club up for sale for £ 4 @.@ 5 million in December 2001 . It was announced that the ground would close by 30 June 2002 , and talks were held over a move to Huntington Stadium . In March 2002 the club was bought by John Batchelor ; he said York could continue at Bootham Crescent until a new stadium was built , when in fact the previous twenty @-@ five @-@ year lease was replaced with one that would expire in June 2003 . Batchelor spoke of building a new stadium at Clifton Moor , and Persimmon , who held ten percent of the shares in BCH , submitted planning applications for ninety @-@ three homes on the site of Bootham Crescent . In March 2003 York extended their lease of the ground to May 2004 , and under the ownership of the Supporters ' Trust proceeded with plans to move to Huntington Stadium . Planning problems arose with bringing the ground up to Football League standards , and the club preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent . York bought Bootham Crescent in February 2004 , after a £ 2 million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund ( FSIF ) was secured . 
 York were relegated into the Conference National for 2004 – 05 , which brought an end to seventy @-@ two years of Football League football at Bootham Crescent . In January 2005 the ground was renamed KitKat Crescent , as part of a sponsorship deal under which Nestlé donated £ 100 @,@ 000 to the club . This money went towards covering the shortfall the club faced paying BCH directors , Persimmon and stamp duty when buying the ground . The ground was still commonly referred to as Bootham Crescent . The deal expired in January 2010 , when Nestlé ended all their sponsorship arrangements with the club . York returned to the Football League for 2012 – 13 , and their first League Two match at Bootham Crescent was a 3 – 1 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012 , before a 4 @,@ 591 crowd . The ground has not been subject to any major investment since the 1990s , and has faced problems with holes in the Main Stand roof , crumbling in the Grosvenor Road End , drainage problems and toilet conditions . 
 = = Future = = 
 The terms of the FSIF loan required the club to identify a site for a new stadium by 2007 , and have detailed planning permission by 2009 , to avoid financial penalties . Once plans for a new stadium were in place , the loan would turn into a grant to assist in funding the relocation . As part of the loan agreement , Persimmon have first refusal on purchasing Bootham Crescent once York leave , for ten percent lower than its market value . Persimmon still intend to build ninety @-@ three homes on the site , and the proceeds of the sale would go towards building the new stadium . In March 2008 York 's managing director Jason McGill cited " the annual cost of £ 60 @,@ 000 for the maintenance and upkeep of a 1932 stadium with few commercial and income @-@ generating opportunities " as the reason for the continued need to move to a new stadium . 
 Despite the club failing to formally identify a site by the end of 2007 , financial penalties were not incurred , as the FSIF were satisfied with the progress made . However , McGill said plans with the preferred site had ground to a halt by March 2008 . City of York Council announced its commitment to building a community stadium in May 2008 , which would be used by York and the city 's rugby league club , York City Knights . In July 2010 the council chose the option of building a 6 @,@ 000 all @-@ seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington , on the site of Huntington Stadium . In August 2014 Greenwich Leisure Ltd were named as the council 's preferred bidder to deliver an 8 @,@ 000 all @-@ seater stadium , a leisure complex and a community hub . Construction is expected to start in the summer of 2016 , for completion in early 2018 .

 The ground can accommodate 8 @,@ 256 supporters , including seating for 3 @,@ 409 , and comprises four stands ; the Main Stand , the Popular Stand , the David Longhurst Stand and the Grosvenor Road End . 
 The Main Stand , which can seat 1 @,@ 757 spectators , is an all @-@ seated stand which runs around two @-@ thirds of the pitch . It contains the dressing rooms , club offices , ticket offices and hospitality suites , and contains a number of supporting pillars . The stand has open corners to either side , one of which is where the supporters ' club is located , and to the rear has windscreens to either side . At the front of it is the Family Stand , which offers adjusted rates for children and their carers . Opposite is the Popular Stand , a covered all @-@ seated stand , which contains a number of supporting pillars and holds a television gantry on its roof . It can seat 1 @,@ 652 spectators . 
 The northernmost stand of the ground is the David Longhurst Stand , which is a covered terrace for home supporters and has a row of supporting pillars across its front . The stand was originally known as the Shipton Street End , but was renamed following the death of David Longhurst , and has a capacity of 3 @,@ 062 . Opposite is the Grosvenor Road End , an open terrace reserved for away supporters , which holds a capacity of 1 @,@ 785 . As well as this , away fans are permitted to use 332 seats of the Popular Stand , in the section closest to the Grosvenor Road End . The toilet facilities for away supporters consist of open air urinals for men and <unk> for women . 
 The grass pitch measures 104 by 64 metres ( 114 by 70 yd ) . Head groundsman Bryan Foster was presented with a gold watch from the directors in March 1988 , in recognition of his long and outstanding service . His successor , Bryan Horner , was voted the Second Division groundsman of the year in 1999 . A club shop is situated just inside the car park , which also houses the commercial manager 's office . Adjoining this is the social club , known as the 1922 Bar since August 2015 , and the players ' bar .

 The ground is located just over a mile from York railway station , which is approximately a twenty @-@ minute walk . The station lies on the East Coast Main Line between London King 's Cross railway station and Edinburgh Waverley railway station , and has direct services from Liverpool , Manchester , Birmingham and the South West . Many of the roads near the ground are for residential permit holders only , meaning car parking at the ground is notoriously difficult . The author Simon Inglis pointed out the irony of the club leaving Fulfordgate because of its location , when " it is harder than ever for fans to drive in to Bootham Crescent " . Parking on matchdays at nearby York Hospital has been available since January 2014 . A park and ride facility operates in the city , and a number of lines drop off within walking distance of the ground .

 = SMS Prinz Eugen ( 1862 ) = 
 SMS Prinz Eugen was the second member of the Kaiser Max class built for the Austrian Navy in the 1860s . Her keel was laid in October 1861 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard ; she was launched in June 1862 , and was completed in March 1863 . She carried her main battery — composed of sixteen 48 @-@ pounder guns and fifteen 24 @-@ pounders — in a traditional broadside arrangement , protected by an armored belt that was 110 mm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) thick . 
 Prinz Eugen saw action at the Battle of Lissa in July 1866 . There she engaged the Italian ironclad fleet ; she did not inflict any serious damage , though she emerged from the battle similarly unscathed . After the war , Prinz Eugen was modernized slightly in 1867 to correct her poor seakeeping and improve her armament , but she was nevertheless rapidly outpaced by naval developments in the 1860s and 1870s . Obsolescent by 1873 , Prinz Eugen was officially " rebuilt " , though in actuality she was broken up for scrap , with only her armor plate , parts of her machinery , and other miscellaneous parts being reused in the new Prinz Eugen .

 Prinz Eugen was 70 @.@ 78 meters ( 232 @.@ 2 ft ) long between perpendiculars ; she had a beam of 10 m ( 33 ft ) and an average draft of 6 @.@ 32 m ( 20 @.@ 7 ft ) . She displaced 3 @,@ 588 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 531 long tons ; 3 @,@ 955 short tons ) . She had a crew of 386 .

 The keel for Prinz Eugen was laid down at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in October 1861 . She was launched on 14 June 1862 , and after fitting @-@ out work was completed in March 1863 , she was commissioned into the Austrian fleet . Owing to her open bow , she took on water excessively and as a result , tended to handle poorly . In June 1866 , Italy declared war on Austria , as part of the Third Italian War of Independence , which was fought concurrently with the Austro @-@ Prussian War . Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff brought the Austrian fleet to Ancona on 27 June , in an attempt to draw out the Italians , but the Italian commander , Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano , refused to engage Tegetthoff . 
 = = = Battle of Lissa = = = 
 On 16 July , Persano took the Italian fleet out of Ancona and steamed to the island of Lissa , where they arrived on the 18th . With the main fleet of twelve ironclads , they brought troop transports carrying 3 @,@ 000 soldiers . Persano then spent the next two days bombarding the Austrian defenses of the island and unsuccessfully attempting to force a landing . Tegetthoff received a series of telegrams between the 17 and 19 July notifying him of the Italian attack , which he initially believed to be a feint to draw the Austrian fleet away from its main bases at Pola and Venice . By the morning of the 19th , however , he was convinced that Lissa was in fact the Italian objective , and so he requested permission to attack . As Tegetthoff 's fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July , Persano 's fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt . The latter 's ships were divided into three groups , with only the first two able to concentrate in time to meet the Austrians . Tegetthoff had arranged his ironclad ships into a wedge @-@ shaped formation , with Prinz Eugen on his right flank ; the wooden warships of the second and third divisions followed behind in the same formation . 
 While he was forming up his ships , Persano transferred from his flagship , Re d 'Italia to the turret ship Affondatore . This created a gap in the Italian line , and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a melee . He made a pass through the gap , but failed to ram any of the Italian ships , forcing him to turn around and make another attempt . During the first approach , Prinz Eugen opened fire with her bow guns but did not score any hits . As soon as her main battery could be brought to bear , she fired concentrated broadsides at unidentified Italian vessels . Affondatore passed close to Prinz Eugen but failed to ram her or score any hits on the Austrian vessel . 
 By this time , Re d 'Italia had been rammed and sunk and the coastal defense ship Palestro was burning badly , soon to be destroyed by a magazine explosion . Persano broke off the engagement , and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians , he refused to counter @-@ attack with his badly demoralized forces . In addition , the fleet was low on coal and ammunition . The Italian fleet began to withdraw , followed by the Austrians ; Tegetthoff , having gotten the better of the action , kept his distance so as not to risk his success . As night began to fall , the opposing fleets disengaged completely , heading for Ancona and Pola , respectively . The Italians had failed to inflict serious damage on any of the Austrian ironclads , including Prinz Eugen . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 After returning to Pola , Tegetthoff kept his fleet in the northern Adriatic , where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack . The Italian ships never came , and on 12 August , the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons ; this ended the fighting and led to the Treaty of Vienna . Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza , the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz . As a result , Austria , which became Austria @-@ Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867 , was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy . 
 Prinz Eugen was rebuilt in 1867 , particularly to correct her poor sea @-@ keeping . Her open bow was plated over and she was rearmed with twelve 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) muzzleloaders manufactured by Armstrong and two 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) 4 @-@ pounder guns . By 1873 , the ship was obsolescent and had a thoroughly @-@ rotted hull , so the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy decided to replace the ship . Parliamentary objection to granting funds for new ships forced the navy to resort to subterfuge to replace the ship . Reconstruction projects were routinely approved by the parliament , so the navy officially " rebuilt " Prinz Eugen and her sister ships . In reality , only some parts of the engines , armor plate , and other miscellaneous parts were salvaged from the ships , with work beginning at the Pola Navy Yard in November 1873 . The new vessels were given the same names of the old vessels in an attempt to conceal their origin . 
 = Pinocchio ( 1940 film ) = 
 Pinocchio is a 1940 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and based on the Italian children 's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi . It was the second animated feature film produced by Disney , made after the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) . 
 The plot of the film involves an old wood @-@ carver named Geppetto who carves a wooden puppet named Pinocchio . The puppet is brought to life by a blue fairy , who informs him that he can become a real boy if he proves himself to be " brave , truthful , and unselfish " . Pinocchio 's efforts to become a real boy involve encounters with a host of unsavory characters . The film was adapted by Aurelius Battaglia , William Cottrell , Otto Englander , Erdman Penner , Joseph Sabo , Ted Sears , and Webb Smith from Collodi 's book . The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske , and the film 's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson , T. Hee , Wilfred Jackson , Jack Kinney , and Bill Roberts . Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation , giving realistic movement to vehicles , machinery and natural elements such as rain , lightning , smoke , shadows and water . The film was released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 23 , 1940 . 
 Critical analysis of Pinocchio identifies it as a simple morality tale that teaches children of the benefits of hard work and middle @-@ class values . Although it became the first animated feature to win a competitive Academy Award – winning two for Best Music , Original Score and for Best Music , Original Song for " When You Wish Upon A Star " – it was initially a box office disaster . It eventually made a profit in its 1945 reissue , and is considered one of the greatest animated films ever made , with a rare 100 % rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes . The film and characters are still prevalent in popular culture , featuring at various Disney parks and in other forms of entertainment . In 1994 , Pinocchio was added to the United States National Film Registry for being deemed " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After singing the film 's signature song " When You Wish Upon a Star " , Jiminy Cricket explains that he is going to tell a story of a wish coming true . His story begins in the Tuscany workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto . Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio ( a name his cat Figaro and fish Cleo both dislike ) . Before falling asleep , Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio would be a real boy . During the night , a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life , although he still remains a puppet . She informs him that if he proves himself brave , truthful , and unselfish , he will become a real boy , and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience . 
 Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true , and is filled with joy . However , on his way to school , Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion , Gideon the Cat , who convince him to join Stromboli 's puppet show , despite Jiminy 's objections . Pinocchio becomes Stromboli 's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings while performing with marionettes of Dutch girls , French can @-@ can girls , and Russian Cossacks . However , when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night , Stromboli locks him up in a birdcage . Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio , and is unable to free him . The Blue Fairy then appears , and asks Pinocchio why he wasn ’ t at school . Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth , but instead he starts telling lies , which causes his nose to grow longer and longer . Pinocchio vows to be good from now on , and the Blue Fairy restores his nose back to its original form and sets them free , while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him . 
 Meanwhile , across town , Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who promises to pay them big money if they can find foolish little boys for him to take to Pleasure Island . Encountering Pinocchio on his way home , they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there . On the way to Pleasure Island , he befriends Lampwick , a delinquent boy . With no rules or authority to enforce their activity , Pinocchio and the other boys soon enjoy smoking , gambling , vandalizing , and getting drunk , much to Jiminy 's dismay . Later , while trying to get home , Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse : the boys brought to Pleasure Island literally transform into donkeys , who are then sold into slave labor . Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio , only to find that Lampwick fully transformed into a terrified donkey ; Pinocchio manages to escape , only partially transformed . 
 Upon returning home , Pinocchio and Jiminy find the workshop empty . They soon discover ( through a message left by the Blue Fairy ) that Geppetto had ventured out to search for Pinocchio , but was swallowed by a giant whale named Monstro , and is now living in his belly . Determined to rescue his father , Pinocchio jumps into the sea , with Jiminy accompanying him . Pinocchio is soon also swallowed by Monstro , where he is reunited with Geppetto . Pinocchio devises a plan to make Monstro sneeze , giving them a chance to escape . The plan works , but the enraged whale chases them , and smashes their raft . Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it . They are all washed up on a beach on the other side . Geppetto , Figaro , Cleo , and Jiminy survive , but Pinocchio lies motionless face down in a tide pool . Back home , the group mourns for him . The Blue Fairy , however , decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave , truthful , and unselfish , that he is reborn as a real human boy ( his donkey ears and tail also gone ) , and everyone celebrates . Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy , and is rewarded by a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience .

 = = = Development = = = 
 In September 1937 , during the production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , animator Norman Ferguson brought a translated version of Carlo Collodi 's 1883 Italian children 's novel , The Adventures of Pinocchio to the attention of Walt Disney . After reading the book " Walt was busting his guts with enthusiasm " as Ferguson later recalled . Pinocchio was intended to be the studio 's third film , after Bambi . However , due to difficulties with Bambi ( adapting the story and animating the animals realistically ) , it was put on hold and Pinocchio was moved ahead in production . 
 = = = Writing and design = = = 
 Unlike Snow White , which was a short story that the writers could expand and experiment with , Pinocchio was based on a novel with a very fixed story . Therefore , the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation . In the original novel , Pinocchio is a cold , rude , ungrateful , inhuman creature that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons by means of brutal torture . The writers decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen 's dummy Charlie McCarthy , but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book . The story was still being developed in the early stages of animation . 
 Early scenes animated by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio 's design was exactly like that of a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose , a peaked cap and bare wooden hands . Walt Disney , however , was not pleased with the work that was being done on the film . He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production . Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing but the design still retained a wooden feel . Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas , Johnston and Moore were " rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet " and felt that they should " forget that he was a puppet and get a cute little boy ; you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards " . Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence . Kahl showed Disney a test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father . From this scene Kahl re @-@ envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy , with a child 's Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four @-@ fingered ( or three and a thumb ) hands with Mickey Mouse @-@ type gloves on them . The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms , legs and his little button wooden nose . Disney embraced Kahl 's scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent , naïve , somewhat coy personality that reflected Kahl 's design . 
 However , Disney found that the new Pinocchio was too helpless and was far too often led astray by deceiving characters . Therefore , in the summer of 1938 Disney and his story team established the character of the cricket . Originally the cricket was only a minor character that Pinocchio killed by squashing him with a mallet and that later returned as a ghost . Disney dubbed the cricket Jiminy , and made him into a character that would try to guide Pinocchio into the right decisions . Once the character was expanded , he was depicted as a realistic cricket with toothed legs and waving antennae , but Disney wanted something more likable . Ward Kimball had spent several months animating a " Soup Eating Sequence " in Snow White , which was cut from the film due to pacing reasons . Kimball was about to quit until Disney rewarded him for his work by promoting him to the supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket . Kimball conjured up the design for Jiminy Cricket , whom he described as a little man with an egg head and no ears . " The only thing that makes him a cricket is because we call him one , " Kimball later joked . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Due to the huge success of Snow White , Walt Disney wanted more famous voices for Pinocchio , which marked the first time an animated film had used celebrities as voice actors . He cast popular singer Cliff Edwards , also known as " <unk> Ike " , as Jiminy Cricket . Edwards was a popular entertainer who had made the first million @-@ selling record . Disney rejected the idea of having an adult play Pinocchio and insisted that the character be voiced by a real child . He cast 12 @-@ year @-@ old child actor Dickie Jones , who had previously been in Frank Capra 's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington . He also cast Frankie Darro as Lampwick , Walter Catlett as <unk> the Fox , Evelyn Venable as the Blue Fairy , Charles Judels as both the villainous Stromboli and the Coachman , and Christian Rub as Geppetto , whose design was even a caricature of Rub . 
 Another voice actor recruited was Mel Blanc , best remembered for voicing many of the characters in Warner Bros. cartoon shorts . Blanc was hired to perform the voice of Gideon the Cat . However , it was eventually decided that Gideon would be mute , so all of Blanc 's recorded dialogue was subsequently deleted except for a solitary hiccup , which was heard three times in the finished film . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 Animation began in September 1938 . During the production of the film , the character model department was headed by Joe Grant , whose department was responsible for the building of three @-@ dimensional clay models of the characters in the film , known as maquettes . These models were then given to the staff to observe how a character should be drawn from any given angle desired by the artists . The model makers also built working models of Geppetto 's cuckoo clocks , as well as Stromboli 's gypsy wagon and the Coachman 's carriage . However , owing to the difficulty animating a realistic moving vehicle , the artists filmed the carriage maquettes on a miniature set using stop motion animation . Then each frame of the animation was transferred onto animation cels using an early version of a Xerox . The cels were then painted on the back and overlaid on top of background images with the cels of the characters to create the completed shot on the rostrum camera . Like Snow White , live @-@ action footage was shot for Pinocchio with the actors playing the scenes in pantomime , supervised by Hamilton Luske . Rather than tracing , which would result in stiff unnatural movement , the animators used the footage as a guide for animation by studying human movement and then incorporating some poses into the animation ( though slightly exaggerated ) . 
 Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation . In contrast to the character animators who concentrate on the acting of the characters , effects animators create everything that moves other than the characters . This includes vehicles , machinery and natural effects such as rain , lightning , snow , smoke , shadows and water , as well as the fantasy or science @-@ fiction type effects like Fairy Dust . The influential abstract animator Oskar Fischinger , who mainly worked on Fantasia contributed to the effects animation of the Blue Fairy 's wand . Effects animator Sandy Strother kept a diary about his year @-@ long animation of the water effects , which included splashes , ripples , bubbles , waves and the illusion of being underwater . To help give depth to the ocean , the animators put more detail into the waves on the water surface in the foreground , and put in less detail as the surface moved further back . After the animation was traced onto cels , the animators would trace it once more with blue and black pencil leads to give the waves a sculptured look . To save time and money , the splashes were kept impressionistic . These techniques enabled Pinocchio to be one of the first animated films to have highly realistic effects animation . Ollie Johnston remarked " I think that 's one of the finest things the studio 's ever done , as Frank [ Thomas ] said , ' The water looks so real a person can drown in it , and they do . ' " 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 The songs in Pinocchio were composed by Leigh Harline with lyrics by Ned Washington . Leigh Harline and Paul J. Smith composed the incidental music score . The soundtrack was first released on February 9 , 1940 . Jiminy Cricket 's song , " When You Wish Upon A Star " , became a major hit and is still identified with the film , and later as the theme song of The Walt Disney Company itself . The soundtrack won an Academy Award for Best Original Score . 
 = = Themes = = 
 M. Keith Booker considers the film to be the most @-@ down @-@ to @-@ earth of the classic Disney animated films despite its theme song and magic , and notes that the film 's protagonist has to work to prove his worth , which he remarked seemed " more in line with the ethos of capitalism " than most of the Disney films . Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid @-@ Walsh believe that the male protagonists of films like Pinocchio and Bambi ( 1942 ) were purposefully constructed by Disney to appeal to both boys and girls . Mark I. Pinksy said that it is " a simple morality tale — cautionary and schematic — ideal for moral instruction , save for some of its darker moments " , and noted that the film is a favorite of parents of young children . 
 Nicolas Sammond argues that the film is " an apt metaphor for the metaphysics of midcentury American child @-@ rearing " and that the film is " ultimately an assimilationist fable " . He considered it to be the central Disney film and the most strongly middle class , intended to relay the message that indulging in " the pleasures of the working class , of vaudeville , or of pool halls and amusement parks , led to a life as a beast of burden " . For Sammond , the purpose of Pinocchio is to help convey to children the " middle @-@ class virtues of deferred gratification , self @-@ denial , thrift , and perseverance , naturalized as the experience of the most average American " .

 Pinocchio went into release accompanied by generally positive reviews . Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times gave the film five out of five stars , saying " Pinocchio is here at last , is every bit as fine as we had prayed it would be — if not finer — and that it is as gay and clever and delightful a fantasy as any well @-@ behaved youngster or jaded <unk> could hope to see . " Time gave the film a positive review , saying " In craftsmanship and delicacy of drawing and coloring , in the articulation of its dozens of characters , in the greater variety and depth of its photographic effects , it tops the high standard Snow White set . The charm , humor and loving care with which it treats its inanimate characters puts it in a class by itself . " The film won the Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Best Original Score , the first Disney film to win either . 
 Initially , Pinocchio was not a box @-@ office success . The box office returns from the film 's initial release were both below Snow White 's unprecedented success and below studio expectations . Of the film 's $ 2 @.@ 289 million negative cost – twice the cost of Snow White – Disney only recouped $ 1 million by late 1940 , with studio reports of the film 's final original box office take varying between $ 1 @.@ 4 million and $ 1 @.@ 9 million . Animation historian Michael Barrier notes that Pinocchio returned rentals of less than one million by September 1940 , and in its first public annual report , Walt Disney Productions charged off a $ 1 million loss to the film . Barrier relays that a 1947 Pinocchio balance sheet listed total receipts to the studio of $ 1 @,@ 423 @,@ 046 @.@ 78 . This was primarily due to the fact that World War II and its aftermath had cut off the European and Asian markets overseas , and hindered the international success of Pinocchio and other Disney releases during the early and mid @-@ 1940s . Joe Grant recalled Walt Disney being " very , very depressed " about Pinocchio 's initial returns at the box office . RKO recorded a loss of $ 94 @,@ 000 for the film . 
 = = = Modern acclaim = = = 
 Many film historians consider this to be the film that most closely approaches technical perfection of all the Disney animated features . Film critic Leonard Maltin said , " with Pinocchio , Disney reached not only the height of his powers , but the apex of what many critics consider to be the realm of the animated cartoon . " Despite its initial struggles at the box office , a series of reissues in the years after World War II proved more successful , and allowed the film to turn a profit . By 1973 , the film had earned $ 13 million from the initial 1940 release and four reissues ; further reissues in subsequent years have brought Pinocchio 's lifetime gross to $ 84 @,@ 254 @,@ 167 at the box office . 
 In 1994 , Pinocchio was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant " . Filmmaker Terry Gilliam selected it as one of the ten best animated films of all time in a 2001 article written for The Guardian and in 2005 , Time named it one of the 100 best films of the last 80 years , and then in June 2011 named it the best animated movie of " The 25 All @-@ TIME Best Animated Films " . 
 In June 2008 , the American Film Institute revealed its " Ten top Ten " — the best ten films in ten " classic " American film genres — after polling over 1 @,@ 500 people from the creative community . Pinocchio was acknowledged as the second best film in the animation genre , after Snow White . It was nominated for the AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies , and received further nominations for their Thrills and Heroes and Villains ( Stromboli ) lists . The song " When You Wish Upon A Star " ranked number 7 on their 100 Songs list , and the film ranked 38th in the 100 Cheers list . The quote " A lie keeps growing and growing until it 's as plain as the nose on your face " was nominated for the Movie Quotes list , and the film received further nomination in the AFI 's Greatest Movie Musicals list . 
 On Rotten Tomatoes , a website which aggregates film reviews , the film has the website 's highest rating of 100 % , meaning every single one of the 41 reviews of the film , from contemporaneous reviews to modern re @-@ appraisals , on the site are positive . The general consensus of the film on the site is " Ambitious , adventurous , and sometimes frightening , Pinocchio arguably represents the pinnacle of Disney 's collected works - it 's beautifully crafted and emotionally resonant .

In the mid @-@ 2000s , DisneyToon Studios began development on a sequel to Pinocchio . Robert Reece co @-@ wrote the film 's screenplay , which saw Pinocchio on a " strange journey " for the sake of something dear to him . " It 's a story that leads Pinocchio to question why life appears unfair sometimes , " said Reece .

 After the release of 1982 's Pornography , the band 's future was uncertain and Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired . With the single " Let 's Go to Bed " released the same year , Smith began to place a pop sensibility into the band 's music and their popularity increased as the decade wore on , with songs like " Just Like Heaven " , " Lovesong " and " Friday I 'm in Love " . The band is estimated to have sold 27 million albums as of 2004 and have released thirteen studio albums , ten EPs and over thirty singles during their career .

 = = = Formation and early years ( 1973 – 79 ) = = = 
 The first incarnation of what became the Cure was the Obelisk , a band formed by students at Notre Dame Middle School in Crawley , Sussex . The band made their public debut in a one @-@ off performance in April 1973 , and featured Robert Smith on piano , Michael " Mick " Dempsey on guitar , Laurence " Lol " Tolhurst on percussion , Marc Ceccagno on lead guitar and Alan Hill on bass guitar . In January 1976 the band took a more substantial form when Ceccagno formed Malice with Smith and Dempsey along with two other classmates from St Wilfrid 's Catholic Comprehensive School , with Ceccagno on lead , Smith on guitar and Dempsey switching to bass . Ceccagno soon left , however , to form a jazz @-@ rock fusion band called Amulet . Increasingly influenced by the emergence of punk rock , Malice 's remaining members became known as Easy Cure in January 1977 . By this time , Smith and Dempsey had been joined by Lol Tolhurst from the Obelisk on drums and new lead guitarist Porl Thompson . Both Malice and Easy Cure auditioned several vocalists before Smith finally assumed the role of Easy Cure 's frontman in September 1977 . 
 That year , Easy Cure won a talent competition with German label Hansa Records , and received a recording contract . Although the band recorded tracks for the company , none were ever released . Following disagreements in March 1978 over the direction the band should take , the contract with Hansa was dissolved . Smith later recalled , " We were very young . They just thought they could turn us into a teen group . They actually wanted us to do cover versions and we always refused . " Thompson was dropped from the band in May , and the remaining trio were soon renamed " The Cure " by Smith . Later that month , the band recorded their first sessions as a trio at Chestnut Studios in Sussex , which were distributed as a demo tape to a dozen major record labels . The demo found its way to Polydor Records scout Chris Parry , who signed the Cure to his newly formed Fiction label — distributed by Polydor — in September 1978 . The Cure released their debut single " Killing an Arab " in December 1978 on the Small Wonder label as a stopgap until Fiction finalised distribution arrangements with Polydor . " Killing an Arab " garnered both acclaim and controversy : while the single 's provocative title led to accusations of racism , the song is actually based on French existentialist Albert Camus 's novel The Stranger . The band placed a sticker label that denied the racist connotations on the single 's 1979 reissue on Fiction . An early NME article on the band wrote that the Cure " are like a breath of fresh suburban air on the capital 's smog @-@ ridden pub @-@ and @-@ club circuit " , and noted , " With a John Peel session and more extensive London gigging on their immediate agenda , it remains to be seen whether the Cure can retain their refreshing joie de vivre . " 
 The Cure released their debut album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979 . Because of the band 's inexperience in the studio , Parry and engineer Mike Hedges took control of the recording . The band , particularly Smith , were unhappy with the album ; in a 1987 interview , he admitted , " a lot of it was very superficial – I didn 't even like it at the time . There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight , and I thought they were justified . Even when we 'd made it , I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it " . The band 's second single , " Boys Don 't Cry " , was released in June . The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees ' Join Hands promotional tour of England , Northern Ireland and Wales between August and October . The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group . That musical experience had a strong impact on him : " On stage that first night with the Banshees , I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music . It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure . Before that , I 'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello ; the punk Beatles . Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing . " 
 The Cure 's third single , " Jumping Someone Else 's Train " , was released in early October 1979 . Soon afterwards , Dempsey was dropped from the band because of his cold reception to material Smith had written for the upcoming album . Dempsey joined the Associates , while Simon Gallup ( bass ) and Matthieu Hartley ( keyboards ) from the <unk> joined the Cure . The Associates toured as support band for the Cure and the Passions on the Future Pastimes Tour of England between November and December — all three bands were on the Fiction Records roster — with the new Cure line @-@ up already performing a number of new songs for the projected second album . Meanwhile , a spin @-@ off band comprising Smith , Tolhurst , Dempsey , Gallup , Hartley and Thompson , with backing vocals from assorted family and friends and lead vocals provided by their local postman Frankie Bell , released a 7 @-@ inch single in December under the assumed name of Cult Hero . 
 = = = Early gothic phase ( 1980 – 82 ) = = = 
 Due to the band 's lack of creative control on the first album , Smith exerted a greater influence on the recording of the Cure 's second album Seventeen Seconds , which he co @-@ produced with Mike Hedges . The album was released in 1980 and reached number 20 on the UK charts . A single from the album , " A Forest " , became the band 's first UK hit single , reaching number 31 on the singles chart . The album was a departure from the Cure 's sound up to that point , with Hedges describing it as " morose , atmospheric , very different to Three Imaginary Boys . " In its review of Seventeen Seconds the NME said , " For a group as young as the Cure , it seems amazing that they have covered so much territory in such a brief time . " At the same time , Smith was pressed concerning the concept of an alleged " anti @-@ image " . Smith told the press he was fed up with the anti @-@ image association that some considered to be " elaborately disguising their plainness " , stating , " We had to get away from that anti @-@ image thing , which we didn 't even create in the first place . And it seemed like we were trying to be more obscure . We just didn 't like the standard rock thing . The whole thing really got out of hand . " That same year Three Imaginary Boys was repackaged for the American market as Boys Don 't Cry , with new artwork and a modified tracklist . The Cure set out on their first world tour to promote both releases . At the end of the tour , Matthieu Hartley left the band . Hartley said , " I realised that the group was heading towards suicidal , sombre music — the sort of thing that didn 't interest me at all . " 
 The band reconvened with Hedges to produce their third album , Faith ( 1981 ) , which furthered the dour mood present on Seventeen Seconds . The album peaked at number 14 on the UK charts . Included with cassette copies of Faith was an instrumental soundtrack for Carnage <unk> , an animated film shown in place of an opening act for the band 's 1981 Picture Tour . In late 1981 , the Cure released the non @-@ album single " Charlotte Sometimes " . By this point , the sombre mood of the music had a profound effect on the attitude of the band . The band would refuse requests for older songs in concert , and sometimes Smith would be so absorbed by the persona he projected onstage he would leave at the end in tears . 
 In 1982 , the Cure recorded and released Pornography , the third and final album of an " oppressively dispirited " trio that cemented the Cure 's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre . Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was " undergoing a lot of mental stress . But it had nothing to do with the group , it just had to do with what I was like , my age and things . I think I got to my worst round about Pornography . Looking back and getting other people 's opinions of what went on , I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time " . Gallup described the album by saying , " <unk> took over [ ... ] We sang ' It doesn 't matter if we all die ' and that is exactly what we thought at the time . " Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track " The Hanging Garden " for release as a single . Despite the concerns about the album 's uncommercial sound , Pornography became the band 's first UK Top 10 album , charting at number eight . The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour , where the band finally dropped the anti @-@ image angle and first adopted their signature look of big , towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces . The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour 's conclusion . Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure . 
 = = = Early commercial success ( 1983 – 86 ) = = = 
 With Gallup 's departure from the Cure and Smith 's work with Siouxsie and the Banshees , rumours spread that the Cure had broken up . In December 1982 , Smith remarked to Melody Maker , " Do the Cure really exist any more ? I 've been pondering that question myself [ ... ] it has got to a point where I don 't fancy working in that format again . " He added , " Whatever happens , it won 't be me , Laurence and Simon together any more . I know that . " 
 Parry was concerned at the state of his label 's top band , and became convinced that the solution was for the Cure to reinvent its musical style . Parry managed to convince Smith and Tolhurst of the idea ; Parry said , " It appealed to Robert because he wanted to destroy the Cure anyway . " With Tolhurst now playing keyboards instead of drums , the duo released the single " Let 's Go to Bed " in late 1982 . While Smith wrote the single as a throwaway , " stupid " pop song to the press , it became a minor hit in the UK , reaching number 44 on the singles chart , but entered the Top 20 in Australia and New Zealand . It was followed in 1983 by two more successful songs : the synthesiser @-@ based " The Walk " ( number 12 ) , and " The Love Cats " , which became the band 's first British Top 10 hit , reaching number seven . The group released these studio singles and their B @-@ sides as the compilation album Japanese Whispers , designed by Smith for the Japanese market only , but released worldwide on the decision of the record company . The same year , Smith also recorded and toured with Siouxsie and the Banshees , contributing as guitarist on their Nocturne live album and video and their Hyaena studio album . Meanwhile , he recorded the Blue Sunshine album with Banshees bassist Steven Severin as the Glove , while Lol Tolhurst produced the first two singles and debut album of the English band And Also the Trees . 
 In 1984 , the Cure released The Top , a generally psychedelic album on which Smith played all the instruments except the drums — played by Andy Anderson — and the saxophone — played by returnee Porl Thompson . The album was a Top 10 hit in the UK , and was their first studio album to break the Billboard 200 in the US , reaching number 180 . Melody Maker praised the album as " psychedelia that can 't be dated " , while pondering , " I 've yet to meet anyone who can tell me why the Cure are having hits now of all times . " The Cure then embarked on their worldwide Top Tour with Thompson , Anderson and producer @-@ turned @-@ bassist Phil Thornalley on board . Released in late 1984 , the Cure 's first live album , Concert consisted of performances from this tour . Near the tour 's end , Anderson was fired for destroying a hotel room and was replaced by Boris Williams . Thornalley also left because of the stress of touring . However , the bassist slot was not vacant long , for a Cure roadie named Gary Biddles had brokered a reunion between Smith and former bassist Simon Gallup , who had been playing in the band Fools Dance . Soon after reconciling , Smith asked Gallup to rejoin the band . Smith was ecstatic about Gallup 's return and declared to Melody Maker , " It 's a group again . " 
 In 1985 , the new line @-@ up of Smith , Tolhurst , Gallup , Thompson and Williams released The Head on the Door , an album that managed to bind together the optimistic and pessimistic aspects of the band 's music between which they had previously shifted . The Head on the Door reached number seven in the UK and was the band 's first entry into American Top 75 at number 59 , a success partly due to the international impact of the LP 's two singles , " In Between Days " and " Close to Me " . Following the album and world tour , the band released the singles compilation Standing on a Beach in three formats ( each with a different track listing and a specific name ) in 1986 . This compilation made the US Top 50 , and saw the re @-@ issue of three previous singles : " Boys Don 't Cry " ( in a new form ) , " Let 's Go to Bed " and , later , " Charlotte Sometimes " . This release was accompanied by a VHS and LaserDisc called Staring at the Sea , which featured videos for each track on the compilation . The Cure toured to support the compilation and released a live concert VHS of the show , filmed in the south of France called The Cure in Orange . During this time , the Cure became a very popular band in Europe ( particularly in France , Germany and the Benelux countries ) and increasingly popular in the US 
 = = = Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Kiss Me and worldwide success ( 1987 – 93 ) = = = 
 In 1987 , the Cure released the musically eclectic double LP Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Kiss Me , which reached number six in the UK , the Top 10 in several countries and was the band 's first entry into the US Top 40 at number 35 ( where it was certified platinum ) , reflecting the band 's rising mainstream popularity . The album 's third single , " Just Like Heaven " , was the band 's most successful single to date in the US , being their first to enter the Billboard Top 40 . The album produced three other singles . The song " Catch " was loosely based on a speech written by Sylvester Stallone in the film Rocky II when the character of Adrian as played by Talia Shire lay in a coma while Rocky reads a poem he wrote for her . After the album 's release , the band embarked on a successful tour . During the European leg of the tour , Lol Tolhurst 's alcohol consumption was interfering with his ability to perform , so the Psychedelic Furs keyboardist Roger O 'Donnell was frequently called upon to stand in for him . 
 In 1989 , the Cure released the album Disintegration , which was critically praised and became their highest charting album to date , entering at number three in the UK and featuring three Top 30 singles in the UK and Germany : " Lullaby " , " Lovesong " and " Pictures of You " . Disintegration also reached number twelve on the US charts . The first single stateside , " Fascination Street " , reached number one on the American Modern Rock chart , but was quickly overshadowed when its third US single , " Lovesong " , reached number two on the American pop charts ( the only Cure single to reach the US Top 10 ) . By 1992 , Disintegration had sold over three million copies worldwide . 
 During the Disintegration sessions , the band gave Smith an ultimatum that either Tolhurst would have to leave the band or they would . In February 1989 , Tolhurst 's exit was made official and announced to the press ; this resulted in Roger O 'Donnell becoming a full @-@ fledged member of the band and left Smith as the Cure 's only remaining founding member . Smith attributed Tolhurst 's dismissal to an inability to exert himself and issues with alcohol , concluding , " He was out of step with everything . It had just become detrimental to everything we 'd do . " Because Tolhurst was still on the payroll during the recording of Disintegration , he is credited in the album 's liner notes as playing " other instrument " ( sic ) and is listed as a co @-@ writer of every song ; however , it has since been revealed that he contributed nothing to the album in either performance or song writing . The Cure then embarked on a successful tour which saw the band playing stadiums in the US . On 6 September 1989 , the Cure performed " Just Like Heaven " at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles . 
 In May 1990 , Roger O 'Donnell quit and was replaced with the band 's guitar technician Perry Bamonte . That November , the Cure released a collection of remixes called Mixed Up . The one new song on the collection , " Never Enough " , was released as a single . In 1991 the Cure were awarded the Brit Award for Best British Group . That same year , Tolhurst filed a lawsuit against Smith and Fiction Records in 1991 over royalties payments , and claimed joint ownership of the name " the Cure " with Smith ; the verdict was handed out in September 1994 in favour of Smith . In respite from the lawsuit , the band returned to the studio to record their next album . Wish reached number one in the UK and number two in the US and yielded the international hits " High " and " Friday I 'm in Love " . The Cure also embarked on the " Wish Tour " with Cranes , and released the live albums Show ( September 1993 ) and Paris ( October 1993 ) . As a promotional exercise with the Our Price music chain in the UK , a limited edition EP was released consisting of instrumental outtakes from the Wish sessions . Entitled Lost Wishes , the proceeds from the four @-@ track cassette tape went to charity . In 1993 , the band were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album for Wish . 
 In the years between the release of Wish and the start of sessions for the Cure 's next album , the band 's line @-@ up shifted again . Thompson left the band once more during 1993 to play with Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin , and Bamonte took over as lead guitarist . Boris Williams also left the band , and was replaced by Jason Cooper ( formerly of My Life Story ) . 
 = = = Period of transition ( 1994 – 98 ) = = = 
 The sessions for the new album began in 1994 with only Smith and Bamonte present ; the pair were later joined by Gallup ( who was recovering from physical problems ) and Roger O 'Donnell , who had been asked to rejoin the band at the end of 1994 . The Cure performed " Burn " in the movie The Crow and " Dredd Song " , the theme song of the 1995 movie Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone . It was not released on a Cure album until 2004 on Join the Dots : B @-@ Sides & Rarities 1978 – 2001 ( The Fiction Years ) . 
 Wild Mood Swings , finally released in 1996 , was poorly received compared with previous albums and marked the end of the band 's commercial peak . Early in 1996 , the Cure played festivals in South America , followed by a world tour in support of the album . In 1997 the band released Galore , a compilation album containing all of the Cure 's singles released between 1987 and 1997 , as well as the new single " Wrong Number " , which featured longtime David Bowie guitarist Reeves Gabrels . Gabrels also accompanied the Cure on a brief American radio festival tour as an onstage guest guitarist for " Wrong Number " . In 1998 , the Cure contributed to the soundtrack album for The X Files feature film as well as the Depeche Mode tribute album For the Masses with their cover of " World in My Eyes " . 
 Another soundtrack appearance occurred with the song " Watching Me Fall " ( later appearing in a different form on the Cure 's next album , Bloodflowers ) , which was remixed by Underdog ( of Massive Attack ) for the 2000 American film American Psycho . 
 = = = Later years ( 1999 – 2009 ) = = = 
 With only one album left in their record contract and with commercial response to Wild Mood Swings and the Galore compilation lacklustre , Smith once again considered that the end of the Cure might be near and thus wanted to make an album that reflected the more serious side of the band . The Grammy @-@ nominated album Bloodflowers was released in 2000 after being delayed since 1998 . According to Smith , the album was the third of a trilogy along with Pornography and Disintegration . The band also embarked on the nine @-@ month Dream Tour , attended by over one million people worldwide . In 2001 , the Cure left Fiction and released their Greatest Hits album and DVD , which featured the music videos for a number of classic Cure songs . In 2002 , the band headlined twelve major summer music festivals , and played three extended concerts ( one in Brussels , two in Berlin ) in which they performed the albums Pornography , Disintegration and Bloodflowers in their respective entireties each night . The Berlin performances were released on DVD as The Cure : Trilogy in 2003 . 
 In 2003 , the Cure signed with Geffen Records . In 2004 , they released a new four @-@ disc boxed set on Fiction Records titled Join the Dots : B @-@ Sides and Rarities , 1978 – 2001 ( The Fiction Years ) . The compilation includes seventy Cure songs , some previously unreleased , and a 76 @-@ page full @-@ colour book of photographs , history and quotes , packaged in a hard cover . The album peaked at number 106 on the Billboard 200 album charts . The band released their twelfth album The Cure on Geffen in 2004 , which was produced by Ross Robinson . It made a top ten debut on both sides of the Atlantic in July 2004 . To promote the album , the band headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival that May . From 24 July to 29 August , the Cure headlined the Curiosa concert tour of North America . While attendances were lower than expected , Curiosa was still one of the more successful American summer festivals of 2004 . The same year the band was honoured with an MTV Icon award in a television special presented by Marilyn Manson . 
 In May 2005 , Roger O 'Donnell and Perry Bamonte were fired from the band . O 'Donnell claims Smith informed him he was reducing the band to a three @-@ piece . Previously O 'Donnell said he had only found out about the band 's upcoming tour dates via a fan site and added , " It was sad to find out after nearly twenty years the way I did , but then I should have expected no less or more . " The remaining members of the band — Smith , Gallup and Cooper — made several appearances as a trio before it was announced in June that Porl Thompson would be returning for the band 's 2005 Festival summer shows , as well as their set at Live 8 in Paris on 2 July . Later that year , the band recorded a cover of John Lennon 's " Love " for Amnesty International 's charity album Make Some Noise . It is available for download on the Amnesty website , while the album was released on CD in 2006 . On 1 April 2006 , the Cure appeared at the Royal Albert Hall on behalf of the Teenage Cancer Trust . It was their only show through to the end the year . In December a live DVD , entitled The Cure : Festival 2005 , including thirty songs from their 2005 Festival tour , was released . 
 The Cure began writing and recording material for their thirteenth album in 2006 . Smith initially stated it would be a double album . The Cure announced a last @-@ minute postponement of their autumn 2007 North American <unk> in August to continue working on the album , rescheduling the dates for spring 2008 . Titled 4 : 13 Dream , the album was released in October 2008 . The group released four singles and an EP — " The Only One " , " Freakshow " , " Sleep When I 'm Dead " , " The Perfect Boy " and <unk> States respectively — on or near to the 13th of each month , in the months leading up to the album 's release . In February 2009 , the Cure received the 2009 Shockwaves NME Award for Godlike Genius .

 In 2011 , the band played their first three studio albums in their entirety during two shows in Sydney . These " Reflections " shows notably featured Roger O 'Donnell and Lol Tolhurst , both in a keyboard and percussion role . Porl Thompson was absent from the performances . The shows were due to be released on DVD in 2012 . The band later headlined Bestival , which they recorded and released as Bestival Live 2011 . Roger O 'Donnell again joined the band on stage . On 11 September 2011 , Roger O 'Donnell announced on his Facebook page that he had officially rejoined the band . The band announced seven more Reflections shows , one in London , three in New York City and three in Los Angeles . On 27 September , the Cure was announced as a nominee for 2012 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . 
 In the NME 's cover article for March 2012 , the Cure announced that they would be headlining a series of summer music festivals across Europe , including the Leeds / Reading Festival . Smith said that the band were currently without a recording contract and that he had " absolutely no idea " when they would next record or release new material . " We 've been going for so long that I don 't feel that urge to capitalise on everything all the time . I mean we 're headlining pretty much every major European festival and we won 't have anything released . " Subsequent media reports quoting directly from the same article suggested that the Cure had ruled out recording any new material altogether . 
 On 1 May , following months of speculation , Porl Thompson , now going by the name of Pearl , confirmed via the Chain of Flowers blog that he would no longer be playing with the Cure , and apologised for upsetting fans with the decision . " [ I ] am working on a lot of new projects ... jewellery , music , art and mixed media [ ... ] paint still flows and my mind state is better than it has been for [ a ] long while " . On 26 May , the Cure embarked on a 19 @-@ date summer festival tour of Europe , commencing at the Pinkpop Festival , joined by former the Cure / <unk> collaborator Reeves Gabrels on guitar . On the same day , it was announced that Gabrels would be standing in for the remainder of the tour , but was not a fully @-@ fledged member of the band . Gabrels later revealed that Robert Smith had emailed him at the end of April to ask if he was free over summer , saying that he missed " having a wingman " on guitar . The <unk> tour , featuring a five @-@ piece line @-@ up of Robert Smith , Simon Gallup , Roger O 'Donnell , Jason Cooper and Reeves Gabrels , included headlining appearances at the 2012 Reading and Leeds Festivals , and concluded in Ireland on 1 September with a headline slot at the Electric Picnic . After some shows in 2012 over Europe , and 2013 shows in Latin America , which included an acclaimed return visit to Argentina , after 26 years ( and Robert Smith 's revoked " oath " of never going back to play in that country ) , The Cure started The Great Circle Tour , headlining big festivals around North America and Asia . 
 The Cure paid tribute to Paul McCartney on the album titled The Art of McCartney , which was released on 18 November 2014 . The Cure covered the Beatles ' song " Hello , Goodbye " which featured guest vocals and keyboards from Paul 's son , James McCartney . A video of the band and James performing the song was released on 9 September 2014 filmed at Brighton Electric Studio in Brighton . Robert Smith also covered McCartney 's " C Moon " on the album 's bonus disc . 
 It was announced on 10 November 2015 that the Cure would embark on a 26 date North American tour in 2016 which will include their first shows in some cities in nearly a decade , and it will include their first shows at cities they have never played at yet . According to the press release the tour will feature " 37 years of Cure songs , mixing hits , rarities , favourites , and as yet unreleased tracks in a brand new stage production " . In 2016 they are scheduled to play across Europe , ending with three concerts at London ´ s Wembley Arena , in a tour that also includes the first Australian dates in years . At a concert in New Orleans on 10th May 2016 , the Cure played two new songs . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 The Cure are often identified with the gothic rock genre , and are viewed as one of the form 's definitive bands . However , the band has routinely rejected classification , particularly as a gothic rock band . Robert Smith said in 2006 , " It 's so pitiful when ' goth ' is still tagged onto the name the Cure " , and added , " We 're not <unk> . I suppose we were post @-@ punk when we came out , but in total it 's impossible [ ... ] I just play Cure music , whatever that is . " Smith has also expressed his distaste for gothic rock , describing it as " incredibly dull and monotonous . A dirge , really . " While typically viewed as producers of dark and gloomy music , the Cure have also yielded a number of upbeat songs . Spin has said " the Cure have always been an either / or sort of band : either [ ... ] Robert Smith is wallowing in gothic sadness or he 's licking sticky @-@ sweet cotton @-@ candy pop off his lipstick @-@ stained fingers . " 
 The Cure 's primary musical traits have been listed as " dominant , melodic bass lines ; whiny , strangulated vocals ; and a lyric obsession with existential , almost literary despair . " Most Cure songs start with Smith and Gallup writing the drum parts and bass lines . Both record demos at home and then bring them into the studio for fine @-@ tuning . Smith said in 1992 , " I think when people talk about the ' Cure sound ' , they mean songs based on six @-@ string bass , acoustic guitar and my voice , plus the string sound from the Solina . " On top of this foundation is laid " towering layers of guitars and synthesisers " . Keyboards have been a component of the band 's sound since Seventeen Seconds , and their importance increased with the instrument 's extensive use on Disintegration . During Roger O 'Donnell 's absence between 2005 and 2011 , keyboards were not used at all during their live shows , and were not as prominent on their 2008 album 4 : 13 Dream . 
 = = Music videos = = 
 The band 's early music videos have been described as " dreadful affairs " and have been maligned for their poor quality , particularly by the band itself . Lol Tolhurst said , " Those videos were unmitigated disasters ; we weren 't actors and our personalities weren 't coming across . " The video for " Let 's Go to Bed " was their first collaboration with Tim Pope . The director added a playful element to the band 's videos ; the director insisted in a 1987 Spin interview , " I think that side of them was always there , but was never brought out . " 
 Pope would go on to direct the majority of the Cure 's videos , which became synonymous with the band , and expanded their audience during the 1980s . Pope explained the appeal of working with the Cure by saying , " the Cure is the ultimate band for a filmmaker to work with because Robert Smith really understands the camera . His songs are so cinematic . I mean on one level there 's this stupidity and humour , right , but beneath that there are all [ Smith 's ] psychological obsessions and claustrophobia . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Cure were one of the first alternative bands to have chart and commercial success in an era before alternative rock had broken into the mainstream . In 1992 , NME declared the Cure had during the 1980s become " a goth hit machine ( 19 to date ) , an international phenomenon and , yep , the most successful alternative band that ever shuffled <unk> about the earth " . Interpol lead singer Paul Banks was quoted as saying , " the Cure is the band that all of us in Interpol can say influenced us . When I was younger I listened to them a lot . Carlos as well . Actually , he took a straight influence from this band on the way he played the bass and the keys . To me , Robert Smith is also one of these examples : you can 't be Robert Smith if you 're not Robert Smith . It 's one of the bands with the deepest influence on Interpol , because we all like them . They 're legendary . " The Cure were also a formative influence on the Smashing Pumpkins . Frontman Billy Corgan has named the Cure as a primary influence , ' and drummer Mike Byrne described himself as a " huge Cure fan . " 
 Several references to the Cure and their music have been made in popular culture . A number of films have used the title of a Cure song as the film 's title , including Boys Don 't Cry ( 1999 ) and Just Like Heaven ( 2005 ) . The Cure 's gloomy image has been the subject of parody at times . In series two of The Mighty Boosh , the Moon sings " The Love Cats " over the credits . In the same episode , a powerful gothic hairspray , Goth Juice , is said to be " The most powerful hairspray known to man . Made from the tears of Robert Smith . " The Mary Whitehouse Experience often featured brief clips of the stars of the show performing comical songs and nursery rhymes as the Cure in a morose style . Robert Smith appeared in the final episode of the second series of The Mary Whitehouse Experience singing " The sun has got his hat on " before punching the character Ray ( played by Robert Newman ) whilst uttering Ray 's catchphrase " Oh no , what a personal disaster " . While not a parody , Robert Smith was the inspiration for the lead character of the film This Must Be the Place . Robert Smith was also portrayed on an episode of South Park ( for which he himself provided the voice @-@ over ) where he transforms into the form of Mothra and battles Mecha @-@ Streisand to save the day . As Smith leaves , the character of Kyle shouts , " Disintegration is the best album ever ! " 
 The band is estimated to have sold 27 million albums as of 2004 .

 = Radama II = 
 Radama II ( September 23 , 1829 – May 12 , 1863 [ assumed dead ] ) was the son and heir of Queen Ranavalona I and ruled from 1861 to 1863 over the Kingdom of Madagascar , which controlled virtually the entire island . Radama 's rule , although brief , was a pivotal period in the history of the Kingdom of Madagascar . Under the unyielding and often harsh 33 @-@ year rule of his mother , Queen Ranavalona I , Madagascar had successfully preserved its cultural and political independence from French and British designs . Rejecting the queen 's policy of isolationism and Christian persecution , Radama II permitted religious freedom and re @-@ opened Madagascar to European influence . Under the terms of the Lambert Charter , which Radama secretly contracted in 1855 with French entrepreneur Joseph @-@ François Lambert while Ranavalona still ruled , the French were awarded exclusive rights to the exploitation of large tracts of valuable land and other lucrative resources and projects . This agreement , which was later revoked by Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony , was key to establishing France 's claim over Madagascar as a protectorate and , in 1896 , as a colony . 
 The dramatic contrast between Ranavalona 's isolationism and her son 's pro @-@ European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order . Radama 's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard of the advice of his ministers ultimately turned them against him . In a coup led by his Prime Minister , Rainivoninahitriniony , Radama II was strangled on May 12 , 1863 . His wife Rabodo , who took the throne name Rasoherina , was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally , but rather in concert with the Hova ( the class of free citizens ) as represented by the position of Prime Minister . The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy . However , there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne . A strong case has since been made on the basis of significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake <unk> in the northwestern part of the island . 
 = = Upbringing and early years = = 
 Radama II was born Prince Rakoto ( <unk> ) on September 23 , 1829 in the <unk> building on the compound of the Rova of Antananarivo . He was officially recognized as the son of King Radama I and his widow Queen Ranavalona I , although the king had died more than nine months before the prince 's birth . He was likely fathered by a lover of his mother , <unk> Rainijohary , a progressive young officer of the Merina army who the queen may have been tricked into putting to death by conservative ministers at court . 
 After his mother succeeded Radama I on the throne , she instituted an increasingly regressive regime that attempted to restore traditional values and contain or eliminate westernization . The prince , however , who had been highly influenced by the French adviser to the queen , Joseph @-@ François Lambert , was favorably impressed by European culture , knowledge and its state of economic , political and technological development , and was troubled by some of the socially repressive policies pursued by Ranavalona I. According to a British account , the French played on this sympathy in 1855 by pressuring Prince Rakoto into signing a request for French aid that would have enabled France to establish control over Madagascar had the true nature of the letter and its signing not been uncovered by Rakoto and his British contacts An alternate explanation was offered by Lambert , who maintained that the prince had knowingly supported the attempt to put an end to his mother 's harsh policies , and was a willing collaborator in a failed 1857 plot to remove her from the throne . 
 Prior to Queen Ranavalona 's death , the conservative and progressive factions within the Merina court waged a tactical power struggle to secure a successor favorable to their own political agenda . The conservative faction favored Ramboasalama , the son of the Queen 's sister , while the Queen 's Prime Minister , Rainivoninahitriniony and head of the army , Rainilaiarivony , brothers and progressives , supported Radama II . The latter successfully obtained key strategic allies within the court that enabled Radama to seize the throne without violence following his mother 's death . Ramboasalama was obliged to swear a public oath of allegiance to Radama , and was later sent into exile in the highland village of <unk> where he died in April 1962 . 
 = = Reign = = 
 Prince Rakoto acceded to the throne on August 16 , 1861 upon the natural death of his mother , Queen Ranavalona I , assuming the throne name Radama II . His coronation ceremony was held the following year on September 23 , 1862 . Once upon the throne , he immediately initiated a rapid and dramatic reversal of many of his mother 's traditionalist policies . He reopened the country to foreign powers and concluded treaties of friendship with Britain and France . The Lambert Charter opened up business possibilities for French investors . Freedom of religion was declared , persecution of Christians ceased , missionaries returned to the island and their schools were reopened . Radama abolished the traditional trial by ordeal of tangena , in which the guilt or innocence of an accused person was determined based on the outcome of consuming the poison of the tangena nut , and inhabitants of Antananarivo were permitted to raise swine within the city walls , a practice previously forbidden by a fady ( taboo ) forbidding them from being kept near the royal talismans ( sampy ) . The sampy were dispersed to the sacred villages where they had originated under 16th @-@ century Merina king Ralambo and other early monarchs . Significantly , Radama freed numerous political prisoners captured under Ranavalona I during provincial wars of subjugation and offered repatriation of confiscated property . This pardon was reciprocated by many of the beneficiary ethnic groups around the island , and good will between the coasts and central administration at Antananarivo improved significantly . These changes , and the king himself , were unequivocally praised by Madagascar 's European partners : 
 " It is most remarkable that Radama II should have formed views of policy so large and liberal , so enlightened , humane and patriotic as those which form the foundation of his throne ; that the son of such a mother , trained up under a despotism so dark , and restrictive and cruel , should have adopted such principles of religious freedom and political economy , as equal civil liberty and universal free trade principles , which our own nation has been so slow to learn , and which are still repudiated in many lands where civilization is far advanced . " 
 The reaction within Imerina was less one @-@ sided . The abrupt and dramatic policy changes pursued by the progressive king both alienated and disfranchised the established conservative factions among the andriana ( nobles ) and Hova ( freemen ) at court . Especially controversial were the special privileges accorded to Joseph @-@ François Lambert and his partners under the Lambert Charter , including the exclusive implementation of public works projects ( felling trees , making roads , building canals etc . ) , control over minting coinage , lucrative mining rights and more as part of the purview of Lambert 's proposed Compagnie de Madagascar ( French Madagascar Company ) . The citizens ' concern stemmed primarily from clauses in the agreement that would have permitted Lambert 's company to become permanent owners of Malagasy lands . Until this point , land in Madagascar , which was viewed by the populace as the sacred ground of the ancestors , could only ever be temporarily possessed by foreigners until their death , at which point the land would revert to the crown . The threat of permanently losing any part of sacred Malagasy soil to foreigners was deeply troubling . 
 = = Assassination plot = = 
 The legalization of dueling was ultimately the issue that brought to a head the tension between King Radama II 's entourage ( mostly friends and some established political figures , known collectively as the menamaso or " red @-@ eyes " ) and representatives of the opposition led by Radama 's prime minister Rainivoninahitriniony . On May 7 , 1863 , Radama II announced his intention to allow disputes to be settled by a duel , much to the disapproval of many of his advisers at court who feared the practice would lead to anarchy . The prime minister prevented the law from being publicly declared at the Zoma ( Friday ) market the following day . Friday afternoon , the prime minister 's younger brother , Rainilaiarivony , who was head of the army , called several thousand troops into the city to besiege a number of the menamaso and members of the royal family at the Rova palace compound , and by Saturday morning the decision had been made and carried out to execute eleven of the menamaso and other key political figures who had counseled Radama to legalize dueling . On Sunday , May 10 , Rainivoninahitriniony demanded that Radama hand over the menamaso he was sheltering in the palace , which he refused to do until the Prime Minister agreed to spare their lives ; they were handed over but by Monday morning had all been speared to death . 
 The drama ended on Tuesday morning , May 12 , 1863 , when a group of officers and soldiers forced their way into the Rova and seized the king . His wife , Queen Rabodo , pleaded for his life to be spared and attempted to stop them but was forcibly removed . The soldiers threw a lamba over Radama 's head and strangled him with a silk sash until he was believed to be dead , thereby avoiding the shedding of royal blood as was the custom for royal executions in Imerina . 
 The nobles informed Rabodo that she would have their support as queen on the condition that she would accept to abide by certain articles that would form a new contract between rulers and ruled in Madagascar : 
 " For the future the word of the sovereign alone was not to be law , but that the sovereign , the nobles and the heads of the people were to unite in making the laws ; that the friendship with foreigners was to be maintained ; that no one was to be put to death on the word of the sovereign alone , but that the nobles and the heads of the people must concur in the sentence before it could be inflicted ; that religion and worship were to be equally free to all – to natives and foreigners , to Christians and non @-@ Christians – excepting in Ambohimanga where there should be no public worship . The ordeal of tangena was not to be used , but death should be inflicted for great crimes . " 
 Rabodo agreed to these conditions . The next morning , it was publicly announced in the marketplace that Radama had taken his own life due to grief over the deaths of his compatriots the menamaso and that Rabodo would succeed him as Queen Rasoherina . To cement the new power @-@ sharing agreement between the ruler , the nobles and the heads of the people , a political marriage was contracted between the queen and Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony , who had been instrumental in her first husband 's death . Radama 's name was struck from the list of kings and it was declared illegal to mourn his death . 
 = = Rumors of survival = = 
 Following Radama II 's apparent death , rumors spread that he had only been rendered unconscious by the attempt on his life and had revived as his body was being transported to Ilafy for interment in his designated tomb . French historian <unk> presents evidence that supports a scenario wherein the group tasked with carrying Radama 's body to Ilafy became frightened as the king began to revive , prompting them to abandon the body and then falsely maintain that they had completed their task to place him in the tomb . Within months after his reported death , rumors began circulating that Radama was alive , residing on the west coast of the island and was amassing supporters for a political comeback . The rumors persisted to the point of causing political turmoil in Antananarivo . These claims may have had some substance judging by the actions of others . Prominent Christian missionaries outside the capital made extensive efforts to visit and support Radama but seemingly never succeeded . Traditionalist factions within the government were concerned enough by the rumors to have put to death sixteen of his supporters , as well as fining hundreds of others . According to evidence in <unk> 's study , Radama may indeed have survived and , failing to regain the throne , lived to old age as an ordinary citizen in the north of the island . 
 With the apparent murder of Radama II , the power of the Merina monarchs was broken . Subsequent monarchs were controlled by influential Hova , particularly Rainilaiarivony , who became Prime Minister after his brother and successively married all three remaining queens of the monarchy : Rasoherina , Ranavalona II and Ranavalona III .

 Mamilla Mall , also known as Alrov Mamilla Avenue , is an upscale shopping street and the only open @-@ air mall in Jerusalem , Israel . Located northwest of Jaffa Gate , the mall consists of a 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) pedestrian promenade called Alrov Mamilla Avenue lined by 140 stores , restaurants , and cafes , and office space on upper floors . The mall sits atop a multi @-@ story parking garage for 1 @,@ 600 cars and buses , and a bus terminal . Designed by Moshe Safdie and developed by Alrov Properties and Lodgings Ltd. of Tel Aviv , the mall incorporates the facades of 19th @-@ century buildings from the original Mamilla Street , as well as the original structures of the Convent of St. Vincent de Paul , the Stern House , and the Clark House . 
 The mall is part of the Alrov Mamilla Quarter , a $ 400 million mixed @-@ use development that also includes the 28 acres ( 11 ha ) David 's Village luxury condominium project , the David Citadel Hotel , the Alrov Mamilla Hotel , and the Karta parking lot . While the overall project was approved by the municipality in the early 1970s , and most of the condominiums and the David Citadel Hotel were completed in the 1990s , construction of the mall was delayed time and again – first due to opposition by preservationist , environmentalist , and religious groups , and then due to bureaucratic disputes , litigation , and arbitration . The mall was finally completed and opened in stages from 2007 to 2008 , thirty @-@ seven years after its initial proposal . 
 = = Location = = 
 Mamilla Mall runs perpendicular to the Old City Walls between Jaffa Road and Yitzhak <unk> Street . It opens onto the intersection of King Solomon , King David , and Agron Streets at its northern end , and Jaffa Gate at its southern end . 
 = = History = = 
 The original Mamilla Street extended from the Mamilla Pool to Jaffa Gate . Along this street , wealthy Arabs constructed homes , offices and stores in the 1800s . Toward the end of the 19th century , and especially during the British Mandate era , the street became a fashionable commercial district . Both Arab and Jewish businessmen operated high @-@ end shops for furniture , textiles , housewares , art , photography , and automobile showrooms . 
 In response to the announcement of the United Nations Partition Plan , Arab mobs stormed Mamilla Street on December 2 , 1947 , ransacking and setting fire to 40 Jewish @-@ owned stores . Jewish merchants fled the area , which then came under heavy bombardment during the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War . With the cessation of hostilities , the area became a no man 's land dividing the Jordanian @-@ occupied Old City from Jewish West Jerusalem , until a truce was signed in 1952 . In the 1950s , poor Sephardic immigrant families and tradesmen took up occupancy in the derelict buildings , and workshops and auto @-@ repair garages replaced the former stores . 
 In 1970 the Jerusalem municipality proposed to overhaul the slum @-@ like area and replace it with a mixed @-@ use development of luxury housing , hotels , and shops . Mayor Teddy Kollek asked architects Moshe Safdie and Gilbert Weil to draw up a plan . The two submitted a " grandiose " scheme that called for the construction of a subterranean traffic system , over @-@ ground buildings , a pedestrian promenade , parking for 1 @,@ 000 cars , and a bus terminal . All of Mamilla 's historic buildings except for the Convent of St. Vincent de Paul would be demolished under the plan . The stated goal was to create a " living bridge " connecting the Old City with the New City of Jerusalem . 
 While the plan was approved by the city in 1972 , it aroused keen opposition from preservationist , environmentalist , and religious groups . In response to the outcry , the city department of town planning submitted a scaled @-@ back design calling for an above @-@ ground traffic system , a pedestrian plaza fronting Jaffa Gate , the retention of facades along Mamilla and King Solomon Streets , and the demolition of historic buildings only in the heart of the Mamilla valley . Though Safdie incorporated these suggestions into a new plan submitted in 1976 , opposition continued unabated by such bodies as the Jerusalem District Planning Commission , the Jerusalem Merchants Association , and the Council for a Beautiful Israel . Nevertheless , in the 1970s , the city spent NIS 130 million to move over 700 families out of Mamilla to the Neve Yaakov , <unk> Ze 'ev , <unk> , and Baka neighborhoods . Workshops and garages were relocated to Talpiot , where they formed the core of the nascent Talpiot industrial zone . 
 The Ladbroke Group of London , which won the original tender to develop the Mamilla project in 1989 , pulled out in the early 1990s and development was handed over to Alfred Akirov of the Alrov Group of Tel Aviv . In the 1990s , Akirov completed 120 out of a planned 200 units in the David 's Village condominium complex , and the David Citadel Hotel . But construction of the mall was delayed again and again due to bureaucratic disputes , litigation , arbitration , and political intervention by Israeli government ministers as Akirov and the government @-@ owned development firm , Karta , went head @-@ to @-@ head on building rights , responsibilities , and compensation . In the 1990s Akirov changed the approved plan for covered arcades on the pedestrian promenade to open @-@ air arches , adding 2 @,@ 000 square metres ( 22 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of retail space ; he also pushed for an entertainment complex with nine cinemas to be installed next to the Convent of St. Vincent de Paul , an idea that the city had vetoed years earlier . ( Following Orthodox Jewish protest , Akirov cancelled the cinema complex . ) When the government refused to approve Akirov ’ s zoning changes , Akirov sued Karta and froze construction on the mall for several years , leaving a swath of half @-@ finished buildings and construction cranes in clear view of Jaffa Gate and the Old City Walls . 
 In August 2006 the Jerusalem District Court upheld three earlier arbitration rulings and ordered Karta to pay Akirov NIS 100 million for project delays . Akirov resumed construction and opened the mall in stages from 2007 to 2008 , bringing closure to a 37 @-@ year project that normally should have taken five to ten years . The 194 @-@ room Alrov Mamilla Jerusalem Hotel , anchored on the north side of the mall , opened in June 2009 . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Mamilla Mall , along with the other components of the Alrov Mamilla Quarter , was designed by Israeli architect Moshe Safdie . With an eye to the historical and archaeological importance of the area , Safdie opted to blend the mall into its surroundings rather than introduce a contemporary design . To that end , he chose materials and construction styles similar to those of the historic Mamilla neighborhood – namely , masonry @-@ block construction and a predominance of arches . Facades removed from 19th @-@ century buildings on the original Mamilla Street were placed on new construction in the mall . 
 Several historic buildings were integrated into the mall design . These are : 
 Clark House , an 1898 structure built by American evangelists living in Jerusalem . The building stands on its original site and was renovated by the architectural firm . 
 Convent of St. Vincent de Paul , operated by the Daughters of Charity , an order of French nuns . Housing an orphanage , old @-@ age home , and a shelter for mentally and physically handicapped people , it was the first structure to be erected on Mamilla Street , in 1886 . It , too , occupies its original site . 
 Stern House , a private home in which Zionist leader Theodor Herzl had lodged overnight during his 1898 visit to Jerusalem . The house had become a Zionist shrine , with the room in which Herzl slept given over to photos and memorabilia from Herzl 's life . Though the house had been heavily damaged in the 1948 war , preservationists won a suit in the Israel Supreme Court to save it from demolition . The two @-@ story masonry @-@ block house , originally located at 18 Mamilla Street , was dismantled brick by brick and warehoused for ten years until builders were ready to reassemble it on Alrov Mamilla Avenue . Safdie left the colored numbers on the brick facades of this and other preserved houses to emphasize the preservation nature of the work . The Stern House presently houses a restaurant , bar , and Steimatzky bookstore . 
 Seven additional 19th @-@ century buildings were dismantled , warehoused , and reconstructed along the promenade . 
 The buildings along Alrov Mamilla Avenue are spaced irregularly rather than placed in a continuous line . The open areas between the buildings accommodate different types of public areas , while the spaces themselves afford views of the historic landmarks beyond the avenue , such as the Tower of David and Jaffa Gate . The buildings lining the avenue range in height from three to six stories , with the higher stories set back from the street line . There is also a two @-@ story , domed atrium housing shops and restaurants . 
 The mall sits atop a six @-@ story parking garage with space for 1 @,@ 600 cars and 60 buses . From the outside , the over @-@ ground structure appears as a series of tiered terraces overflowing with greenery . <unk> built into the terraces admit natural light to each parking level . Outside the entrances to the parking garage stand terminals for city buses . 
 At its southern end , the promenade opens onto a small , multi @-@ tiered , landscaped park facing Jaffa Gate . 
 = = Retail = = 
 Mamilla Mall contains 300 @,@ 000 square feet ( 28 @,@ 000 m2 ) of retail space . Its 140 stores appeal to all economic strata , from high @-@ end international chains Tommy Hilfiger and Abercrombie & Fitch ; to Israeli designer boutiques such as Castro , Dorin Frankfurt , and Ronen Chen ; to mid @-@ range restaurants and a " supermarket @-@ style " pharmacy . There are numerous chain stores selling fashions and cosmetics , as well as gift and souvenir stores . The Gap store , which opened in the mall in August 2009 , is the chain 's first store in Israel . Among the cafes are branches of Café Rimon , Aroma Espresso Bar , and <unk> . 
 Due to the diversity of retail establishments , the mall attracts a wide cross @-@ section of Israeli residents and tourists . These include secular and religious Jews , Christians , Muslims , Armenian monks , young couples , families , and students . At the height of the summer and tourist seasons in July and August , an estimated 20 @,@ 000 people visit the mall daily .
