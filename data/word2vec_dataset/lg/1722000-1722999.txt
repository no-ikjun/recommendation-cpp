 The Texas A & M University system , in 2006 , was the first to explicitly state in its policy that technology commercialization was a criterion that could be used for tenure . Passage of this policy was intended to give faculty more academic freedom and strengthen the university 's industry partnerships . Texas A & M works with both state and university agencies on various local and international research projects to forge innovations in science and technology that can have commercial applications . This work is concentrated in two primary locations – Research Valley and Research Park . Research Valley , an alliance of educational and business organizations , consists of 11 @,@ 400 acres ( 50 km2 ) with 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 square feet ( 232 @,@ 000 m2 ) of dedicated research space . An additional 350 acres ( 1 km2 ) , with 500 @,@ 000 square feet ( 46 @,@ 000 m2 ) of research space , is located in Research Park . Among the school 's research entities are the Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine , the Texas Transportation Institute , the Cyclotron Institute , the Institute of Biosciences and Technology , and the Institute for Plant Genomics and Biotechnology . Texas A & M University is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium . 
 In 2013 with $ 955 million Texas A & M ranked in the top three universities for research expenditures ; third behind only MIT and UC Berkeley . In 2004 , Texas A & M System faculty and research submitted 121 new inventions and established 78 new royalty @-@ bearing licensing agreements ; the innovations resulted in income of $ 8 million . The Texas A & M Technology Licensing Office filed for 88 patents for protection of intellectual property in 2004 . 
 Spearheaded by the College of Veterinary Medicine , Texas A & M scientists created the first cloned pet , a cat named ' cc ' , on December 22 , 2001 . Texas A & M was also the first academic institution to clone each of six different species : cattle , a Boer goat , pigs , a cat , a deer and a horse . 
 In 2004 , Texas A & M joined a consortium of universities and countries to build the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile ; the largest optical telescope ever constructed , the facility has seven mirrors , each with a diameter of 8 @.@ 4 meters ( 9 @.@ 2 yd ) . This gives the telescope the equivalent of a 24 @.@ 5 meters ( 26 @.@ 8 yd ) primary mirror and is ten times more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope . Ground @-@ breaking for the construction of the telescope began in November 2015 . 
 As part of a collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Nuclear Security Administration , Texas A & M completed the first conversion of a nuclear research reactor from using highly enriched uranium fuel ( 70 % ) to utilizing low @-@ enriched uranium ( 20 % ) . The eighteen @-@ month project ended on October 13 , 2006 , after the first ever refueling of the reactor , thus fulfilling a portion of U.S. President George W.

 Texas A & M has participated in over 500 research projects in over 80 countries and leads the Southwestern United States in annual research expenditures . The university conducts research on every continent and has formal research and exchange agreements with 100 institutions in 40 countries . Texas A & M ranks 13th among U.S. research universities in exchange agreements with institutions abroad and student participation in study abroad programs , and has strong research collaborations with the National Natural Science Foundation of China and many leading universities in China . 
 Texas A & M owns three international facilities , a multipurpose center in Mexico City , Mexico , the Soltis Research and Education Center near the town of San Isidro , Costa Rica , and the Santa Chiara Study Abroad Center in Castiglion Fiorentino , Italy . In 2003 , over 1 @,@ 200 Aggie students , primarily undergraduates , studied abroad . Marine research occurs on the University 's branch campus , Texas A & M University at Galveston . It also has collaborations with international facilities such as the Hacienda Santa Clara in San Miguel de Allende , Guanajuato . 
 Texas A & M 's Center for International Business Studies is one of 28 supported by the U.S. Department of Education . The university is also one of only two American universities in partnership with <unk> , Mexico 's equivalent of the National Science Foundation , to support research in areas including biotechnology , telecommunications , energy , and urban development . In addition , the university is the home of " Las Americas Digital Research Network " , an online architecture network for 26 universities in 12 nations , primarily in Central and South America . 
 Texas A & M has a campus in Education City , Doha , Qatar . The campus is part of Qatar ’ s “ massive venture to import elite higher education from the United States ” . TAMUQ was set up through an agreement between Texas A & M and the Qatar Foundation for Education , Science , and Community Development , a foundation started in 1995 by then @-@ emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife and mother of the current emir , <unk> <unk> bint Nasser . TAMUQ was opened in 2003 , and the current contract extends through 2023 . The campus offers undergraduate degrees in chemical , electrical , mechanical and petroleum engineering and a graduate degree in chemical engineering . TAMUQ has received numerous awards for its research . Texas A & M receives $ 76 @.@ 2 million per year from the Qatar Foundation for the campus . In the agreement with the Qatar Foundation , TAMU agreed that 70 % of its undergraduate population at its Qatar campus would be Qatari citizens . The curriculum aims to “ duplicate as closely as possible ” the curriculum at College Station , but questions constantly arise over whether this is possible due to Qatar ’ s strict stance on some of the freedoms granted to U.S. students . TAMU has also been the subject of criticism over its Qatari campus due to Qatar ’ s support of global terrorism and appalling human rights record . Texas A & M Aggie Conservatives , a campus activism group , has spoken out against the campus and called for its immediate closure on the grounds that it violates a commitment to educating Texans , and diminishes the credibility of engineering degrees earned by students at College Station . 
 In late 2013 , Texas A & M signed an agreement to open a $ 200 million campus in Nazareth , Israel as a “ peace campus ” for Arabs and Israelis . The agreement led to protests from students at the Qatari campus who claimed that it was “ an insult to [ their ] people ” . The campus was never opened . Instead , Texas A & M opened a $ 6 million marine biology center in Haifa , Israel .

 Texas A & M 's College Station campus , one of the largest in America , spans 5 @,@ 200 acres ( 21 km2 ) plus 350 acres ( 1 km2 ) for Research Park . The university is part of the Bryan @-@ College Station metropolitan area located within Brazos County in the Brazos Valley ( Southeast Central Texas ) region , an area often referred to as " Aggieland " . According to the U.S. Census Bureau , as of 2008 , the population of Brazos County is estimated at 175 @,@ 122 . Money Magazine , in 2006 , named College Station the most educated city in Texas , and the 11th most educated American city , due largely to the presence of the university and the size and scope of its research . Aggieland is centrally located within 200 miles ( 320 km ) of 3 of the 10 largest cities in the US and 75 % of the Texas and Louisiana populations ( approximately 13 million people ) . The area 's major roadway is State Highway 6 , and several smaller state highways and Farm to Market Roads connect the area to larger highways such as Interstate 45 . 
 The campus is bisected by a railroad track operated by Union Pacific . The area east of the tracks , known as Main Campus , includes buildings for the colleges of engineering , architecture , geosciences , science , education and liberal arts . <unk> , as well as the main dining centers and many campus support facilities , are also on Main Campus . Notable buildings on Main Campus include Kyle Field , Sterling C. Evans Library , the Academic Building , Harrington Hall , the Memorial Student Center , the Administration Building , Rudder Tower , Albritton Bell Tower , and the Bonfire Memorial . To the west of the railroad tracks lies West Campus , which includes most of the sports facilities , the business school , agricultural programs , life sciences , the veterinary college , the political science and economics school , the George Bush School of Government and Public Service , the George Bush Presidential Library and two schools within the Texas A & M Health Science Center .

 During the 2006 fall semester , 20 @.@ 5 percent of the student body lived on campus in one of two distinct housing sections located on opposite ends of campus . Both the Northside and Southside areas contain student dormitories , also known as residence halls . While some halls are single @-@ sex , others are co @-@ educational . Usually students of different genders live on alternate floors , although some halls are segregated by room or suite . Residence hall styles vary . Many halls offer only indoor access to individual rooms , but other halls locate room entrances on an outdoor balcony . Room sizes vary by building . Halls with larger rooms include en @-@ suite or private bathrooms , while halls with smaller rooms have a common bathroom on each floor . Several halls include a " substance @-@ free " floor , where residents pledge to avoid bringing alcohol , drugs , or cigarettes into the hall . 
 Northside consists of 17 student residence halls , including the 3 university honors dorms . Two of the university honors dorms are freshman only . The halls are located near local entertainment district Northgate , and offer convenient access to campus dining establishments : Sbisa Dining Hall , The Underground and Bernie 's Cafe . The demolition of Moore Hall , Crocker Hall , and McInnis Hall is scheduled for August 2011 . A $ 58 million 600 @-@ bed residence hall will replace the demolished halls that have accommodated roughly the same number . Some halls ( particularly Walton ) have unofficially claimed tables within the Sbisa Dining Hall and many halls congregate for dinner at a specific time each weekday . 
 Several of the residence halls located on Southside are reserved for members of the Corps of Cadets . Non @-@ corps halls in this area center around the Commons , a hub for activities and dining . Southside has two Learning Living Communities , which allow freshmen to live in a cluster with other students who share common interests . 
 Facilities for the Corps of Cadets are located in the Quadrangle , or " The Quad " , an area consisting of dormitories , Duncan Dining Hall , and the Corps training fields . The Corps Arches , a series of 12 arches that " [ symbolize ] the spirit of the 12th Man of Texas A & M " , mark the entrance to the Quadrangle . All cadets , except those who are married or who have had previous military service , must live in the Quad with assigned roommates from the same unit and graduating class . Reveille , the Aggie mascot , lives with her handlers in the Quadrangle .

 = = = Corps of Cadets = = = 
 Texas A & M is one of six United States Senior Military Colleges . The schools ' Corps of Cadets ( or the Corps ) is one of the largest uniformed student bodies outside the service academies . Many members participate in ROTC programs and earn commissions in the United States Armed Forces upon graduation . Members of the Corps have served in every armed conflict fought by the United States since 1876 . There were 20 @,@ 229 Aggies who served in World War II , of these , 14 @,@ 123 served as officers , more than any other school , including the combined totals of the United States Military Academy and the United States Naval Academy . Since 1876 , 225 Aggies have served as generals or Flag Officers . 
 Until 1965 , Corps membership was mandatory . The Corps welcomed female members in the fall of 1974 , and as of spring 2012 , the co @-@ ed Corps boasts an enrollment of more than 2000 cadets . 
 The Corps is composed of three Air Force Wings , three Army Brigades , two Navy and Marine Regiments , as well as the Fightin ' Texas Aggie Band , whose members may be affiliated with any military branch . Parson 's Mounted Cavalry is the only mounted ROTC unit in the United States . The Ross Volunteer Company , the oldest student @-@ run organization in the state , is the official honor guard for the Governor of Texas . The Fish Drill Team , a precision , close @-@ order rifle drill team composed entirely of Corps freshmen , represents the school in local and national competitions . They have won the national championship almost every year since their creation in 1946 , and have appeared in several Hollywood productions , with prominent roles in the movies A Few Good Men and Courage Under Fire . 
 The Fightin ' Texas Aggie Band , the world 's largest precision military marching band , provides music for University functions and presents intricate halftime performances at football games . Some band drills are so complicated that they require band members to step between each other 's feet to complete the maneuvers . These drills must be drawn by hand as computer marching programs have returned errors ; their calculations require two people to be in the same spot at the same time . 
 = = = Activities = = = 
 Texas A & M has over 1 @,@ 000 student organizations , including academic , service , religious , Greek and common interest organizations . Orientation programs encourage students to become involved in campus activities and organizations from the beginning . An April 2005 campus survey found that 74 % of the students were involved with at least one organization and that 88 % participated in a campus organization in the past . 
 One of the oldest student organizations is the Singing Cadets , founded in 1893 . Known as the " Voice of Aggieland " , the Singing Cadets are an all @-@ male choral group with about 70 members not affiliated with the Corps of Cadets . The group travels nationally and has completed several international tours ; most recently , China in 2013 . 
 Texas A & M Hillel , the oldest Hillel organization in the United States , was founded in 1920 at the original college . The organization occurred three years before the national Hillel Foundation was organized at the University of Illinois . 
 GLBT Aggies is the descendant organization of Gay Student Services ( GSS ) , the only student organization to ever successfully sue the institution for official recognition . In the decision Gay Student Services v. Texas A & M University , the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the First Amendment required public universities to recognize student organizations aimed at gay students . 
 The Graduate Student Council , founded in 1995 , serves as the student government for Texas A & M University 's graduate and professional students . It is a council representing all TAMU graduate students with a purpose to improve graduate students ' academic , living and social experiences . The GSC represents students ' concerns and is their liaison with the University Administration . 
 Students exercise at the Student Rec Center , a three @-@ story facility encompassing 373 @,@ 000 square feet ( 34 @,@ 650 m2 ) , which includes exercise equipment , athletic courts , an indoor running track , a rock @-@ climbing tower , and one of the top competitive pools and diving wells in the country . The Rec Center also organizes intramural sports throughout the year . 
 Some national service organizations originated at A & M. Aggie students founded the largest one @-@ day student @-@ run service project in America known as The Big Event . The annual service project allows students to give back to their community by assisting local residents . The organization <unk> , a student @-@ run , safe ride program has provided over 250 @,@ 000 free rides ( as of February 2016 ) to Aggies unable to transport themselves home . Its organizers also assist other universities in establishing similar programs . In addition , the Corporation for National and Community Service listed A & M among the 500 academic institutions in the 2005 – 06 President 's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll . 
 The Student Government Association ( SGA ) , one of A & M 's largest organizations , consists of over 1 @,@ 300 student members in 3 branches , 15 committees , and 4 commissions . SGA has changed little since 1972 , except its relative position within the official framework of the university .

 = = Traditions = = 
 The Texas A & M culture is a product of the university 's founding as a rural military and agricultural school . Although the school and surrounding community have grown , and military training is no longer required , the school 's history has instilled in students " the idealized elements of a small @-@ town life : community , tradition , loyalty , optimism , and unabashed sentimentality . " Texas Monthly posits that Texas A & M students ' respect for school traditions and values is the university 's greatest strength . Some of the school traditions date to the 1890s , while others have been introduced more recently . These traditions enable enrolled students and alumni to cultivate the Aggie Spirit , a sense of loyalty and respect for the school . They dictate many aspects of student life , including how to greet others ( using the official school greeting " Howdy ! " ) , how to act at an A & M sporting event , and often , what words a student may use in conversation . 
 A visible designation tradition among senior undergraduates and alumni is the wearing of the Aggie Ring , whose design has been relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1894 . Students may order a ring after completing 90 credit hours of coursework , including at least 45 hours at A & M , or after graduation . Graduate students may receive a ring after 75 % of their graduate coursework is completed or after the acceptance of their dissertation or thesis . Though unsanctioned by the University , many students " dunk " their newly acquired Aggie Rings into a pitcher of beer and quickly chug the entire pitcher to " earn " the ring . Some students dunk their rings in alternative substances , including ice cream or <unk> beverages . 
 In keeping with the idea that all enrolled students and " former students " comprise a family ( the term alumni is not generally used , as " former students " include those who could not complete their education , such as those who entered military service ) , Aggies have created two traditions to honor members of the Aggie family who have died . Aggie Muster is held annually on the anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto , April 21 , to honor the death during the previous year of any enrolled student or alumni . Over 300 Musters are held around the world , with the largest taking place at Reed Arena on the Texas A & M University campus . All Muster ceremonies feature the Roll Call for the Absent . As the names of the deceased Aggies are called , a family member or friend answers " Here " and lights a candle , to symbolize that although their loved one is not present in body , his or her spirit will shine forever . The event received worldwide attention during World War II , when 25 Aggies " mustered " during the battle for the island of Corregidor . 
 Students who die while enrolled at Texas A & M are also honored at Silver Taps , a ceremony held , when necessary , on the first Tuesday of the month . This tradition began as a memorial for former Texas A & M president Lawrence Sullivan Ross . On the day of the ceremony , flags fly half @-@ staff and notices are posted throughout campus . At 10 : 15 pm the lights around campus are extinguished and hymns chime from Albritton Tower while students and faculty collect in the Academic Plaza . Following a 21 @-@ gun salute by the Ross Volunteer Firing Squad , six buglers play an A & M version of the song Taps , Silver Taps , three times from the dome of the school 's Academic Building : once to the north , the south and to the west . The song is not played to the east symbolizing that the sun will never rise on that Aggie again .

 = = = = 12th Man = = = = 
 Aggie football fans are called the 12th Man , meaning that they support the 11 players on the field and would be willing , if it were possible , to enter the game if necessary . To further symbolize their " readiness , desire , and enthusiasm , " it is traditional for students in attendance to stand throughout the game . The tradition began on January 2 , 1922 , at the Dixie Classic where A & M played Centre College . A & M had so many injuries in the first half of the game that Coach Dana X. Bible feared he would not have enough men to finish the game . He called into the stands for E. King Gill , a reserve who had left football after the regular season to play basketball . Although he did not actually play , his readiness symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game . A & M won 22 – 14 , but E. King Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies . In recent decades , the 12th Man is represented on the field by a walk @-@ on player who wears the No. 12 jersey and participates in kick @-@ offs . 
 The 12th Man uses a variety of school yells , rather than cheers , to support Aggie teams . Each year the student body elects five students to serve as the Yell Leaders . At midnight before each home football game at Kyle Field or at a predesignated location at away games , the fans gather together to practice the yells for the next day 's game . Led by the Yell Leaders , and the Fightin ' Texas Aggie Band , the Twelfth Man files into the stadium to participate in Midnight Yell Practice to practice yells , sing the War Hymn , and joke about their opponents . At the conclusion of the yell practice , the stadium lights are extinguished and fans kiss their dates . This is also done as practice , because Aggies are expected to " mug down " , or kiss their dates , every time the football team scores on the field . Sports Illustrated named Midnight Yell as one of the " 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate . " 
 On November 12 , 2015 , Texas A & M sued the Indianapolis Colts for infringing on its trademark of the 12th Man . 
 = = = = Bonfire = = = = 
 Almost every year since 1909 , A & M students have built a large bonfire to celebrate their " burning desire to beat the hell outta " the University of Texas . Aggie Bonfire was traditionally lit around Thanksgiving in conjunction with the festivities surrounding the annual college football game between the schools . Though it began as a trash pile , Aggie Bonfire evolved into a massive six @-@ tiered structure , the world record being held at 109 feet ( 30 m ) . The collapse of the 1999 structure , causing the deaths of 12 students and an alumnus , prompted the university to suspend the official sanction of the bonfire , and the tradition continues off @-@ campus .

 The Aggies are a member of the Southeastern Conference in all sports as of July 1 , 2012 . Previously a charter member of the Southwest Conference until its dissolution in 1996 , A & M competed in the Big 12 Conference until June 30 , 2012 . The school 's 20 sports teams are known as the Aggies , and the school 's colors are maroon and white . As of April 2011 , Aggies have earned 138 Southwest and Big 12 conference regular @-@ season and tournament titles and 11 team national championships . The women 's soccer team , formed in 1993 , earned 15 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1995 to 2009 , advancing at least as far as the round of 16 in seven of the last eight appearances . The women 's volleyball team earned 12 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1993 to 2004 , advancing past the first round each time . In 2004 Sports Illustrated on Campus ranked Olsen Field " the best college baseball venue " . Sports Illustrated ranked the university 46th , in a 2002 analysis of " America 's Best Sports College [ s ] " and College Station the 9th best college sports town . 
 A & M 's archrival was the University of Texas until joining the SEC . In 2004 , sporting events between the Aggies and Longhorns became known as the Lone Star Showdown .

 = Don Chafin = 
 Don Chafin ( June 26 , 1887 – August 9 , 1954 ) was the sheriff of Logan County , West Virginia and a commander in the Battle of Blair Mountain . As sheriff of Logan County , Chafin was a fierce opponent of unionization and received hundreds of thousands of dollars from coal mine operators in return for his violent suppression of the United Mine Workers union . 
 Chafin 's most notable anti @-@ union measures came during the 1921 Battle of Blair Mountain , when he organized an effort to prevent armed miners from crossing through Logan County . He assembled a force of thousands of local townspeople , sheriff 's deputies , and national guardsmen . His forces successfully prevented the advance of the miners until federal troops intervened and forced the latter to disperse . As a result of his actions , Chafin became a hero of the mine operators and an enemy of the miners . 
 In 1924 , Chafin was arrested in connection with <unk> and sentenced to two years in prison . After his release , he became an important figure in the Democratic Party of West Virginia , and a lobbyist for the coal industry . In 1936 , he moved to Huntington , West Virginia , where he was a wealthy and well @-@ known figure until his death in 1954 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Chafin was born on June 26 , 1887 , near the town of Kermit in present @-@ day Mingo County , West Virginia , the sixth of eleven children . His father , Francis Marion Chafin , was the sheriff of Logan County , and Chafin grew up in the town of Logan . ( He was related to the Hatfield family of West Virginia — his great aunt <unk> " <unk> " Chafin was the wife of Anderson Hatfield ) . For two years he studied in the preparatory department of Marshall College – without taking college courses – but did not graduate . He also attended the Mountain State Business College , before teaching at the <unk> School in Mingo County . 
 In 1905 , Chafin married Mary Mounts , with whom he eventually had 10 children , eight of whom survived to adulthood . Three years later , in 1908 , Chafin was appointed the tax assessor of Logan County . In 1912 , Chafin was elected sheriff of Logan County for the first time , and in 1920 he was elected county clerk as well . 
 = = As sheriff = = 
 After becoming sheriff of Logan County , Chafin became known as " the boss " of Logan County or " the czar " , and its " best known citizen " . His authority extended so far into every aspect of public life that he reportedly controlled every judge and jury in the county . According to Howard B. Lee , the former Attorney General of West Virginia , Chafin was so powerful that " no schoolteacher was employed without his approval . " 
 Chafin 's vast power attracted the attention of mine operators , who paid him to keep the unions out of Logan County . The operators bribed Chafin with large payments , and paid many of the expenses of the sheriff 's department . While the exact payments to Chafin are unknown , a special commission ordered by Governor John Cornwell found that he received a payment of at least $ 32 @,@ 700 per year in return for keeping the union out of Logan County . Other estimates of the bribes paid to Chafin range as high as $ 61 @,@ 571 in 1921 , and other evidence suggests the possibility of even higher figures . The historian Robert <unk> reports that although Chafin 's annual salary was only $ 3 @,@ 500 per year , his net worth by 1921 was in excess of $ 350 @,@ 000 , suggesting that he received bribes of at least $ 50 @,@ 000 annually . 
 The operators also directly paid the salary of at least forty of Chafin 's deputies , ensuring control over the department and favorable treatment . The bribes from the mine owners did indeed result in favors from Chafin ; Chafin stationed one of his deputies at every railway station in Logan County to " guard against union organizers " . Upon suspicion that someone entering the county was a union organizer , Chafin 's deputies would either force him to leave , arrest him , or beat him . In one case , Chafin mistook J. L. Heiser , the Chief Clerk of the West Virginia Department of Mines , for a union organizer , then threatened him with a gun , hit him over the head with a blackjack , and forced him to leave the county . After the incident , realizing his mistake , Chafin paid Heiser $ 1 @,@ 000 in compensation , but never faced any other consequences for his actions . 
 = = = Shooting = = = 
 Chafin 's anti @-@ union activities did successfully keep the United Mine Workers out of Logan County , but they also aroused the anger of UMW officials . Chafin also established a record of violent and unpleasant confrontations with union officials outside of Logan County . In one such incident in September 1919 , Chafin entered the office of the UMW in Charleston , West Virginia while he was " drunk armed and very belligerent . " William Petry , the vice @-@ president of the local union , asked Chafin to leave , but Chafin responded by brandishing a revolver . Petry then shot Chafin in the chest with a 22 @-@ caliber pistol . Petry was later cleared of criminal wrongdoing on the grounds that his action was self @-@ defense , but he expressed no remorse about the shooting and later remarked " That 's what happens when a man carries a toy pistol . That goddamned son of a bitch is liable to get well . I should have had my old ' forty @-@ four . ' " In a second shooting incident , a miner walked into Chafin 's sheriff office in Logan and , without a word , shot him in the chest . Chafin walked the two blocks to Logan General Hospital with a bullet lodged in his chest two inches from his heart . In a third incident , a disgruntled constituent walked into his office , with a gun drawn and reportedly said " Don Chafin , I 'm gonna ' shoot you dead . " Chafin reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a pistol of his own , and said , " Go ahead . We 'll hop into Hell together . " The man left without firing a shot . 
 = = Battle of Blair Mountain = = 
 Chafin 's conflict with the unions became most pronounced during the Battle of Blair Mountain in August and September 1921 . A strike , with its beginning in 1920 , had led to increasing violence throughout southern West Virginia , including the Battle of Matewan . The growing violence led to a declaration of martial law in 1921 , and a Congressional investigation into the circumstances in the area began , but it accomplished little . Then Sid Hatfield , the miners ' hero from the Battle of Matewan , was killed on August 1 by Baldwin @-@ Felts agents on the steps of the McDowell County Courthouse in Welch . After his murder and funeral , tensions erupted in southern West Virginia . 
 = = = The miners assemble = = = 
 Shortly after Hatfield 's death , a large group of miners began to assemble south of Charleston along Lens Creek , and prepared to march south to Mingo County , and free their fellow miners who had been imprisoned under the martial law decree for violent acts . The path of the march would take the miners directly across Logan County , causing fear for Chafin and his backers . Chafin declared " No armed mob will cross Logan County " , and prepared to stop the miners as they crossed Blair Mountain . Chafin 's pronouncements and preparations were regarded with contempt by the miners , who took up the cry , " We 'll hang Don Chafin to a sour apple tree . " One of the leaders of the miners , Ed Reynolds , later testified that a central aim of the march was " to kill Sheriff Don Chafin " . 
 Faced with the oncoming miner army , Chafin put into place plans he had been forming since early summer . Chafin had formed a small army of several hundred volunteers , composed of his deputies , mine guards , and members of the Logan County middle class , and had begun to train them in June . He established large weapons caches , including a stockpile of machine guns , and erected breastworks on the slopes of Blair Mountain . At around 2 a.m. on August 25 , Chafin turned on the fire siren in the town of Logan , calling together his army . By morning , 700 members of his volunteer army were assembled on the slopes of Blair Mountain . In addition to his land forces , Chafin established a small air force , composed of three biplanes that he rented from private owners for use in reconnaissance . 
 After initial skirmishes on August 25 and August 26 between Chafin 's forces and the miners , UMW officials managed to defuse the tensions in the area , and convinced the miners to go home . Chafin recalled his troops and told them " You have been in defense of our rights . Logan County will never forget it . " Before the miners dispersed , however , the West Virginia State Police attempted to arrest a group of their leaders , and the attempt escalated into a shootout in which several miners died . Suddenly the rebellion reignited , and it became clear that a major battle was coming . 
 = = = The battle = = = 
 Chafin reorganized and enlarged his forces , and volunteers from around the state arrived to join his army . The Governor of West Virginia , Ephraim Morgan , also helped Chafin recruit men to join his forces , and sent an unofficial national guard unit to join him . Governor Morgan then named William Eubanks as a colonel of the National Guard , and ordered him to take command of the forces from Chafin . Chafin officially passed command to Eubanks , but " the army remained Chafin 's in popular perception . " 
 As it became clear that battle was imminent , and Chafin printed leaflets for his biplanes to drop on the miners , ordering them one last time to disperse . The effort produced no results , and both sides prepared for the conflict . Not long after the leaflets were dropped , the battle " erupted in hot warfare . " Chafin served as Eubanks 's second in command , and helped organize forces . The next day , September 1 , as the fighting intensified , Chafin left the front lines to establish a second line of defense around the town of Logan in case the miners broke through the first line . That same day , Chafin also equipped his biplanes with pipe bombs and tear gas , which they dropped on the miners , though they inflicted no serious casualties . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 The next day , September 2 , the battle ended when federal troops under General Harry Hill <unk> arrived . Chafin and his army went home , and Chafin became " a hero in the eyes of the coal operators " for his role in stopping the march . While the operators regarded Chafin as a hero , the miners placed the blame for the bloodshed on Chafin . 
 Regardless of his role in the events , Chafin remained sheriff after the battle and began to round up and arrest a number of the leaders of the miners . While some of the top leaders arranged to be arrested in other jurisdictions to stay out of Chafin 's hand , others including Frank Keeney , a top UMW official , and Bill Blizzard , the so @-@ called general of the miners , surrendered to Chafin and were put in jail in Logan County . The trials eventually were transferred to other jurisdictions , and the prisoners passed out of Chafin 's hands without incident . 
 = = Politics and arrest = = 
 After the battle , Chafin went back to his normal work as sheriff of Logan County and " became more arrogant " , believing his position to be unassailable . He became involved in a number of illegal ventures , including a <unk> operation . He also became increasingly important within the West Virginia Democratic party , due to his celebrity status after the battle . He was frequently present in the state capitol , and attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention as a member of the West Virginia delegation . 
 A few months later , Chafin 's illegal activities led to his arrest . One of his deputies , Tennis Hatfield , was arrested for violation of the Volstead Act , and he implicated Chafin at his trial . Chafin was tried and convicted of violation of the Volstead Act at the federal courthouse in Huntington , West Virginia on October 14 , 1924 . He was given the maximum sentence of two years in prison , and ordered to pay a fine of $ 10 @,@ 000 . The judge in the case also took special precautions to protect the witnesses against Chafin , due to his potentially violent nature . Chafin appealed the verdict , but it was upheld in April 1925 , and he was sent to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta . He served part of his term before being paroled back to Logan County . While Chafin was in prison , he lost much of his influence in Logan County , and his political opponents took power . After his release from prison , Chafin moved to Charleston and retained some of his influence in the Democratic Party of West Virginia while lobbying for the coal industry . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In 1936 , Chafin moved to Huntington , where he purchased a number of properties including the Guaranty Bank , on top of which he built a penthouse as his home . He lived in semi @-@ retirement there for the rest of his life . 
 In his later days , Chafin trained coon dogs , and was known as " one of Huntington 's wealthiest men " and a " familiar figure " in the city . He suffered several heart attacks in his later life , and eventually died on August 9 , 1954 in a Huntington hospital after a surgical procedure .

 = Coprinopsis atramentaria = 
 Coprinopsis atramentaria , commonly known as the common ink cap or inky cap , is an edible ( but sometimes poisonous , see below ) mushroom found in Europe and North America . Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius , it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C. <unk> . It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere . Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn , commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns , as well as grassy areas . The grey @-@ brown cap is initially bell @-@ shaped before opening , after which , it flattens and disintegrates . The flesh is thin and the taste mild . It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name , tippler 's bane . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The common ink cap was first described by French naturalist Pierre Bulliard in 1786 as Agaricus atramentarius before being placed in the large genus Coprinus in 1838 by Elias Magnus Fries . The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word <unk> " ink " . 
 The genus was formerly considered to be a large one with well over 100 species . However , molecular analysis of DNA sequences showed that the most species belonged in the family Psathyrellaceae , distinct from the type species that belonged to the Agaricaceae . It was given its current binomial name in 2001 as a result , as this and other species were moved to the new genus Coprinopsis . 
 The term " tippler 's bane " is derived from its ability to create acute sensitivity to alcohol , similar to disulfiram ( Antabuse ) . Other common names include common ink cap and inky cap . The black liquid that this mushroom releases after being picked was once used as ink . 
 = = Description = = 
 Measuring 3 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter , the greyish or brownish @-@ grey cap is initially bell @-@ shaped , is furrowed , and later splits . The colour is more brownish in the centre of the cap , which later flattens before melting . The very crowded gills are free ; they are whitish at first but rapidly turn black and easily <unk> . The short stipe measures 7 – 17 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 6 @.@ 8 in ) high by 1 @.@ 5 cm in diameter , is grey in colour , and lacks a ring . The spore print is dark brown , and the almond @-@ shaped spores measure 8 – 11 by 5 – 6 μm . The flesh is thin and pale grey in colour . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Coprinopsis atramentaria occurs across the Northern Hemisphere , including Europe , North America , and Asia , but has also been found in Australia , where it has been recorded from such urban locations as the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and around Lake Torrens , and also in South Africa . 
 Like many ink caps , it grows in tufts . It is commonly associated with buried wood and is found in grassland , meadows , disturbed ground , and open terrain from late spring to autumn . Fruiting bodies have been known to push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts . It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots , and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year . If dug up , the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 Consuming Coprinopsis atramentaria within a few hours of alcohol results in a " disulfiram syndrome " . This interaction has only been known since the early part of the twentieth century . Symptoms include facial reddening , nausea , vomiting , malaise , agitation , palpitations and tingling in limbs , and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol . If no more alcohol is consumed , they will generally subside over two or three hours . Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed , becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5 mg / dL , and prominent at concentrations of 50 – 100 mg / dL . <unk> has , however , been known to cause myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) . The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms , although they are milder as more time passes . Rarely , a cardiac arrhythmia , such as atrial fibrillation on top of <unk> tachycardia , may develop . 
 The fungus contains a <unk> compound called coprine . Its active metabolite , 1 @-@ <unk> , blocks the action of an enzyme , acetaldehyde dehydrogenase , which breaks down acetaldehyde in the body . Acetaldehyde is an intermediate metabolite of ethanol and is responsible for most symptoms of a hangover ; its effect on autonomic β receptors is responsible for the <unk> symptoms . 
 Treatment involves reassuring the patient that the often frightening symptoms will pass , rehydration ( fluid replacement ) for fluid loss from vomiting , and monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias . 
 Large and prolonged doses of coprine were found to have <unk> effects on rats and dogs in testing . 
 = Corps of Colonial Marines = 
 The Corps of Colonial Marines were two Marine units raised from former slaves for service in the Americas by the British at the behest of Alexander Cochrane . The units were created at two different times , and were later disbanded once the military threat had disappeared . 
 The first Corps was a small unit that served in the Caribbean from 1808 to 12 October 1810 , recruited from former slaves to address the shortage of military manpower in the Caribbean . The locally @-@ recruited men were less susceptible to tropical illnesses than were troops sent from Britain . The Corps followed the practice of the British Army 's West India Regiments in recruiting slaves as soldiers . 
 The second , more substantial , Corps served from 18 May 1814 until 20 August 1816 . The greater part of the Corps was stationed on the Atlantic coast , with a smaller body occupying a fort on the Gulf coast in Florida . Recruits were accepted from among escaped slaves who had already gained their freedom on coming into British hands and who were unwilling to join West India Regiments . The establishment of the force sparked controversy at the time , the arming of former slaves representing a psychological threat to the slave @-@ owning society of the Americas ) . As a consequence , the two senior officers of the Corps in Florida ( George Woodbine and Edward Nicolls ) were demonised in Niles ' Register for their association with the Corps and inducing slave revolt . 
 At the end of the War of 1812 , as the British post in Florida was evacuated the Corps ' Florida detachment was paid off and disbanded . Although several men accompanied the British to Bermuda , the majority continued to live in settlements around the wooden stockade the Corps had garrisoned ( which had become a symbol of slave insurrection ) . This legacy of a community of armed fugitive slaves with a substantial arsenal would lead to tensions with the United States of America . Those remaining later took part in the Battle of Negro Fort in July 1816 , after which they joined the southward migration of Seminoles and African Americans escaping the American advance . Members of the Colonial Marine battalion who were deployed on the Atlantic coast withdrew from American territory . They would continue in British service as garrison @-@ in @-@ residence at Bermuda until 1816 , when the unit was disbanded and the ex @-@ Marines resettled on Trinidad . 
 = = First Corps = = 
 Rear Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane raised the first Corps of Colonial Marines in 1808 while commander @-@ in @-@ chief of British naval forces on the Leeward Islands station during the Napoleonic Wars . The British had captured the island of Marie Galante earlier that year , but the French governor of Guadeloupe attacked the island on hearing that illness had weakened its British garrison . Marie Galante slaves assisted the British when promised that they would not be returned to their proprietors ; by this means , the island was preserved under British control until the arrival of three companies of the 1st West India Regiment . 
 Cochrane named the ex @-@ slaves the Corps of Colonial Marines , which was enlarged with fugitive slaves from Guadeloupe . The Corps was paid from Marie Galante revenues , clothed from Royal Navy stores and commanded by Royal Marine officers . After the repossession of Guadeloupe Cochrane maintained the Corps , and on 12 October 1810 redistributed the men : 70 among the ships of the squadron , 20 to 30 to the battery at the Saintes ( a group of small islands south of Guadeloupe ) and 50 remaining in the Marie Galante garrison . They saw no further action as a distinct body , but were listed in ships ' musters among supernumeraries for wages and victuals under the description " Colonial Marine " until mid @-@ 1815 . 
 = = Second Corps = = 
 Cochrane , by now a Vice Admiral , assumed his position as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of British forces on the North Atlantic station in April 1814 and ordered the recruitment of a body of Colonial Marines as he had done six years earlier on Marie Galante . Rear Admiral George Cockburn , Cochrane 's second @-@ in @-@ command on the Atlantic coast , implemented Cochrane 's order recruiting the second Corps of Colonial Marines . It served as part of the British forces on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States during the War of 1812 . 
 On 2 April 1814 , Cochrane issued a proclamation to all persons wishing to emigrate . Any persons would be received by the British , either at a military outpost or aboard British ships ; those seeking sanctuary could enter His Majesty 's forces , or go " as free settlers to the British possessions in North America or the West Indies " . ( An historical precedent was Dunmore 's Proclamation of 7 November 1775 , although this offered freedom only to those who bore arms with British forces . ) 
 = = = Recruitment and Atlantic coast service = = = 
 By 10 May , Tangier Island off the Virginia coast had been occupied by the British and offered an accessible location for those seeking refuge . Male refugees were given the option " to become blue Jackets , take up arms or [ to ] join the working party " constructing Fort Albion and its infrastructure . The Corps was embodied on 18 May 1814 and made its combat debut in the raid on Pungoteague Creek on 30 May 1814 where , in a skirmish known as the Battle of <unk> 's Gut , it helped capture an American artillery battery . James Ross , captain of HMS Albion , later described their involvement as " a most excellent specimen of what they are likely to be . Their conduct was marked by great spirit and vivacity , and perfect obedience " . One , a soldier named Michael Harding , was killed early in the battle but " it did not daunt or check the others , but on the contrary animated them to seek revenge " . Cockburn 's initial impressions were positive ; he observed that the new recruits were " getting on astonishingly " and were " really fine fellows " . After this , the Corps participated in the Chesapeake campaign ; in subsequent correspondence , Cockburn wrote that the recruits had behaved " unexpectedly well " in several engagements and had not committed any " improper outrages " . 
 Members of the Corps served alongside their shipborne Royal Marine counterparts from the Cockburn Chesapeake squadron ( HM Ships Albion , Dragon , Loire , <unk> and the schooner HMS St Lawrence ) , participating in a series of raids . After the British failed to destroy the American Chesapeake Bay Flotilla at the Battle of St. Jerome Creek , they conducted coastal raids on the towns of Calverton , Huntingtown , Prince Frederick , Benedict and Lower Marlborough . On 15 June 1814 , a force of 30 Colonial Marines accompanied 180 Royal Marines in 12 boats in a raid on Benedict . Nine days later , on 24 June , a force of 50 Colonial and 180 Royal Marines attacked an artillery battery at <unk> Creek ( although this failed to prevent the escape of the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla , which left St. Leonard 's Creek two days later ) . 
 The arrival on 19 July of a battalion of Royal Marines , which had left Bermuda on 30 June , enabled the squadron to mount further expeditions ashore . After a series of diversionary raids , the Marines were again landed at Benedict on 19 August accompanied by recently @-@ arrived Peninsular War army veterans . The battalion was to accompany the Colonial Marines in attacks on Bladensburg and Washington in August 1814 . A company fought at the Battle of Bladensburg , and the other two companies took part in the burning of Washington . One of the firing parties was led by Second Lieutenant Lewis Agassiz ( 1793 – 1866 ) ; for his part in the battle , his family was later granted a coat of arms depicting a torch . Casualties suffered by the Colonial Marines during this action were one man killed and three wounded . 
 On 3 September 1814 , three companies of the Colonial Marines joined with three remaining companies of Royal Marines to form the 3rd Battalion , Royal and Colonial Marines . Later that month , all three companies fought at the Battle of North Point in Maryland . A fourth company was created in December 1814 , and further recruitment was begun along the Georgia coast during the first quarter of 1815 . The number of enlistments allowed two more companies to be raised , with sergeants taken from companies recruited in the Chesapeake . 
 Although the Corps suffered some combat losses during its Chesapeake campaign actions in 1814 , its greatest losses arose from disease due to poor conditions on Tangier Island . An outbreak of dysentery in the winter of 1814 killed the surgeon and 69 men from the battalion . The Corps ' last tour during the War of 1812 was in Georgia from December to March 1815 . Admiral George Cockburn seized the southern U.S coast to disrupt trade , communication , and transportation of troops to the Gulf of Mexico , where Admiral Cochrane 's forces planned to take the southwestern territories of the U.S. Part of the Corps joined the successful British attack on Fort Point Peter . The corps occupied Camden County and Cumberland Island , aiding the emigration of an estimated 1 @,@ 485 slaves from southeast Georgia .

 In addition to British outposts on the Atlantic coast at Tangier and the Cumberland Islands , there was a similar outpost on the Gulf coast at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River in Spanish East Florida which attracted Redstick Creek Indians and Black Seminoles . George Woodbine and a detachment of Royal Marines were landed from HMS Orpheus in May 1814 with gifts , two thousand muskets and blankets for the Indians . A fort was constructed , and Cochrane sent Edward Nicolls to oversee the operations at Prospect Bluff . 
 Nicolls left Bermuda with 112 Royal Marines , 3 field pieces , 300 uniforms and 1 @,@ 000 muskets for recruits to his corps . On 26 August 1814 Nicolls issued his first " order of the day " for his " battalion " . It remains uncertain how many men Nicolls had under his command at that time , since muster and pay records have not been found . More escaped slaves were recruited in Pensacola ( to the chagrin of the Spanish ) , but they were forced to return to Prospect Bluff in November after the American capture of Pensacola .

 The war ended in February 1815 , and the three European companies of the 3rd Battalion , Royal and Colonial Marines were sent back to Britain . With their departure , the battalion was reformed as the 3rd Battalion , Colonial Marines , consisting of six infantry companies of Colonial Marines and a staff company of Royal Marines brought from Canada . It performed garrison duty at the Royal Naval Dockyard at Ireland Island , Bermuda and was disbanded in Trinidad on 20 August 1816 . Near what is now known as Princes Town , the former Colonial Marines formed a free farming community , known as the <unk> ( sometimes spelled <unk> ) under the supervision of their former non @-@ commissioned officers , the men formed 16 @-@ acre ( 6 @.@ 5 ha ) households . These settlements were successful , and in 1847 their ownership of the land was formally recognised . The community of descendants retains its identity and commemorates its roots in an annual celebration . 
 The detachment in Florida , which had grown to about 400 men , was paid off and disbanded when the British post was evacuated at the end of the war . A small number of men went to Bermuda with the British as part of a refugee group , rejoining the main body of Colonial Marines . Others from the Florida unit remained in settlements around the wooden stockade , which had become a symbol of slave insurrection . Andrew Jackson opposed the presence of a group of armed fugitive slaves ( although they were in a sparsely @-@ populated area of Spanish Florida ) ; this led to the Battle of Negro Fort in July 1816 and the beginning of the First Seminole War . For their involvement in the conflict , two former auxiliary officers of the corps were executed in 1818 in what became known as the Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident . It is believed that former Colonial Marine refugees were among a group that escaped to the Bahamas in 1822 and founded , on the west coast of the island of Andros , a community that retains its identity to the present day . 
 = Tapeworm ( band ) = 
 Tapeworm is a defunct side project of Nine Inch Nails which existed in various forms from 1995 to roughly 2004 . Tapeworm never released any recordings , but was frequently referenced in interviews . The band started as a side @-@ project between Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and live @-@ band members Danny Lohner and Charlie Clouser . Through the years the group expanded and evolved numerous times to include artists such as Maynard James Keenan , Atticus Ross , and Alan Moulder , effectively turning the project into a supergroup . After many years of rumors and expected release dates , Reznor announced the end of the project in 2004 . 
 = = History = = 
 Tapeworm 's genesis occurred during Nine Inch Nails recording sessions following The Downward Spiral tours circa 1996 . While working on Nine Inch Nails material , Danny Lohner and Charlie Clouser , both Nine Inch Nails live band members , would often come up with ideas that Reznor felt did not fit in with his vision for the band . Tapeworm developed as an outlet for this material — a democratic group in which Lohner and Clouser could act as equals with Reznor , as opposed to Nine Inch Nails , in which Reznor maintained sole artistic control . 
 As time went on , Tapeworm evolved into a supergroup , with guest musicians such as Maynard James Keenan , Page Hamilton , and Phil Anselmo recording material ostensibly to be used by the group . In 1999 Lohner reported that three tracks had been completed , and described the various materials featuring Anselmo as " heavy NIN @-@ meets @-@ Pantera " and " mellow Pink Floyd The Wall @-@ type songs " , and the material featuring Keenan as " psychedelic , groove @-@ oriented verses and anthemic choruses . " Tommy Victor recorded material with the band as well , and later told Rolling Stone that the continued delays on Tapeworm contributed to his decision to take a hiatus from music , as well as accusing Reznor of giving his Tapeworm guitar contribution to Marilyn Manson . 
 In a statement issued to MTV News , Reznor reflected on his collaborations with Keenan : 
 It has been an interesting experiment for Maynard and I to peek around in each other 's heads , shining flashlights in some shadowy corners ... We 've realized we 're each in somewhat similar places in our respective lives and outlook , so it 's been great to collaborate on that level . 
 By 2001 , long @-@ time Nine Inch Nails collaborator Alan Moulder had tracked " more than an album 's worth " of demos . Moulder further described the rough tracks as " very unlike The Fragile " and were a deviation from most Nine Inch Nails material . By 2002 , Clouser had left Nine Inch Nails and was no longer associated with Tapeworm . The group , which now consisted of Reznor , Lohner , Keenan , and Atticus Ross , booked time in a recording studio in hopes of producing an album . An official website , <unk> ( now offline ) , was created to showcase pictures from various recording sessions , including images of Josh Freese behind a drum kit . 
 In September 2003 , Lohner told Kerrang ! magazine that the album was " ready to mix " but had been held up by legal issues stemming from conflicts between Reznor and Keenan 's record labels . The Tapeworm material was reported numerous times as completion neared , most notably by MTV News and Kerrang ! , and was slated to be released on Reznor 's Nothing Records label . Initial recording sessions for the band were staged in the Nothing Studios in New Orleans , though were later reported as being moved to Southern Tracks Studios in Atlanta , Georgia . 
 In 2004 , Reznor announced that Tapeworm was " dead for the foreseeable future " , citing label issues , Keenan 's A Perfect Circle obligations , and Reznor 's own waning enthusiasm for the project . Reznor summarized the project 's demise by saying " the bottom line is this : if the music had been great , all of this probably could have been worked out . " During an interview with digg founder Kevin Rose in 2009 , Reznor further commented that he thought the material was not as good as could have been given his and Keenan 's respective backgrounds and it was unlikely that the material would ever surface , but went on to say that he would like for the two of them to work together again at some point in the future . 
 = = Contributors = = 
 Musicians who have been cited as recording material for Tapeworm , in alphabetical order : 
 = = Known songs = = 
 There are only two songs known to be attributed to Tapeworm . The actual Tapeworm versions of the song have not been heard , but cover versions by Maynard James Keenan 's other projects have surfaced . 
 " Vacant " is one of two songs to be attributed to the Tapeworm project . It was initially written by Lohner and re @-@ arranged by Clouser , with lyrics and melody by Keenan and chorus and backing vocals by Reznor . The song was first performed live by A Perfect Circle throughout their 2001 tour . Reznor was apparently not happy that Keenan performed the song : " I have to admit I find it mildly irritating for " Vacant " to debut in this fashion before feeling it has been properly realized , " Reznor said in a post on the Nine Inch Nails official website . Nonetheless , a remake of the track appeared in a revised form on A Perfect Circle 's 2004 cover album eMOTIVe under the title " Passive " . 
 Another side @-@ project of Maynard James Keenan , Puscifer , released an album titled " C " Is for ( Please Insert <unk> Genitalia Reference HERE ) with a song , " Potions ( Deliverance Mix ) , " which had writing credits given to Trent Reznor . 
 In response to rumors that Keenan released the song without any changes made , a blog was posted on the home page of the main Puscifer website on November 18 , 2009 saying that : 
 Ok . Let 's use an APC album as an <unk> eMOTIVe . APC did a song called " Imagine . " If you view the credits for the song you 'll find various bits of info . Generally speaking the writers name appears in parenthesis next to the track . The performer info may or may not be listed in the album credits . If you see performer info it may be broken down to instruments . For example ... " Billy Howerdel - Guitars and Back @-@ up Vocals . Josh Freese - Drums and percussion , etc ... Or it may be a given that the people who performed on this project / album / track are the band in question . So it will just say " B Howerdel - guitars , Josh Freese - drums , M J Keenan - vocals , etc . ... But Writing credits are different . Next to " Imagine " you 'll see the name John Lennon . Because he wrote the song . You may want to sit down for the next bit . Ready ? John Lennon didn 't perform or sing or play on the APC version of " Imagine . " He didn 't produce it , direct it , co @-@ produce it , or grab us Latte 's during the recording of it . Why ? Because he 's <unk> he just wrote it . And we performed a version of it . If you visit the Project Credits of this site now , you 'll start to see what we mean . Hope that helps . 
 Later Keenan delved further into the issue on his Twitter account only nine hours after the initial blog had been posted . Keenan essentially confirmed the song 's origins in the Tapeworm project while also confirming that the song was covered and released by Puscifer in the same fashion as A Perfect Circle did with " Passive , " saying the following : 
 [ To ] conclude if [ I ] may . If [ you ] <unk> Potions , hate US not Trent . We wrote it together , but <unk> produced it . It was my wedding present [ to ] him . 
 = Roosters ( Millennium ) = 
 " Roosters " is the sixteenth episode of the second season of the American crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It originally aired on the Fox network on March 13 , 1998 . The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong , and directed by Thomas J. Wright . 
 Millennium Group offender profilers Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) and Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) become embroiled in a growing schism within the Group , prompted by the discovery of the True Cross . " Roosters " is the second half of a two @-@ part episode , continuing the story which began in " Owls " . 
 " Roosters " develops plot elements introduced both in " Owls " and in the earlier instalment " The Hand of St. Sebastian " , and would later be followed up by the season 's two @-@ part finale . The episode also features the use of operatic music , a decision praised by the show 's composer Mark Snow . The episode featured guest appearances by Kristen Cloke , Philip Baker Hall and R. G. Armstrong . " Roosters " received a mixed critical reaction , and attracted 5 @.@ 4 percent of the available audience during its initial broadcast .

 Continuing from " Owls " , Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) approaches the car that has been surveilling his home . The occupants claim to be fellow members of the Millennium Group , but soon begin shooting ; Black takes cover and returns fire , shooting one of the men before the car escapes . The car is later found abandoned . 
 Meanwhile , Lara Means ( Kristen Cloke ) is examining evidence relating to Johnston 's murder ; she discovers that Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) had suppressed infrared post @-@ mortem photographs . Learning of this , the Elder ( Philip Baker Hall ) — a high @-@ ranking Group official — demands an explanation ; Watts divulges that the murdered man had been conspiring to pit conflicting faction within the Group against each other . Watts had found evidence in one of the photographs which may have influenced such a schism and wished to keep it hidden until its significance could be known . The Elder agrees , and similarly decides to hold off on testing which would reveal if an artefact in Johnston 's possession was an authentic piece of the True Cross . 
 Black 's wife Catherine ( Megan Gallagher ) is approached at her new job by a colleague , who reveals that the company is part of the Odessa network . Meanwhile , Black visits Catherine 's boss Clear Knight ( Kimberly Patton ) , experiencing visions of Nazi Germany after seeing a watercolour painting in her office . Later that night Black is visited by Means and the Old Man ( R. G. Armstrong ) , another high @-@ ranking Group member . They explain to Black that the Group has , throughout history , been privy to scientific discoveries of which the public has no knowledge . Johnstone had theorised the existence of a tear in the universe which would reach Earth in several decades ; his death may be connected to this theory . The Old Man also explains that the Group has been infiltrated in the hopes of splintering it , by members of the Odessa network — a faction founded by fugitive Nazis which had previously been known for its anti @-@ communist work and has now turned its focus to the Millennium Group . 
 When Catherine finds her colleague dead , she flees from the company premises and finds her husband , who has deduced that her job offer was simply a way for Odessa to reach him . Elsewhere , an Odessa agent murders the Old Man in Frank 's home ; the loss serves to reunite Watts , Means and Black , who contrive a plan to strike back at Odessa . As the Elder conducts a funeral for the Old Man , a <unk> kills his assassin , while Odessa 's Paraguayan headquarters is destroyed and Knight 's company is raided and closed . The Elder finishes his rites and returns home , opening a package delivered from the Middle East ; inside is the fragment of the True Cross . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Roosters " was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong , who also served as co @-@ executive producers for the second season . It was the thirteenth episode to have been written by the pair , who had penned several across the first and second seasons of the series . " Roosters " was directed by Thomas J. Wright ; Wright had directed twelve episodes previously and would helm a further thirteen over the series ' run . Wright would also go on to direct " Millennium " , the series ' crossover episode with its sister show The X @-@ Files . 
 Morgan has noted that the plot for " Roosters " , and the previous instalment " Owls " , grew out of the internecine conflict seen within the Millennium Group in " The Hand of St. Sebastian " , an earlier second season episode he had penned with Wong . Morgan had wanted to introduce secular elements to the series ' focus on eschatology , after the theological focus of the earlier episode ; he began focussing on ideas such as biological warfare as a possible way of depicting the end of the world — an idea which would later play out in the two @-@ part episodes concluding the second season , " The Time Is Now " and " The Fourth Horseman " . Millennium 's composer Mark Snow spoke positively about the series ' producers for their decision to use operatic music in this episode , rather than relying on " hip @-@ hop or rock and roll " as prior episodes had done . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 " Roosters " was first broadcast on the Fox network on March 13 , 1998 . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5 @.@ 4 during its original broadcast , meaning that 5 @.@ 4 percent of households in the United States viewed the episode . This represented approximately 5 @.@ 29 million households . 
 The A.V. Club 's Zack Handlen gave the episode an " A − " , finding that it " lacks the wild momentum of " Owls " " . However , Handlen felt that , mostly as a result of its characters and the performances given , the episode served as a satisfying conclusion to the story arc . Handlen particularly highlighted O 'Quinn 's performance , reflecting positively on his increased importance in the series and noting that " portrayal of an acolyte struggling with the demands and doubts of his faith does as much for Millennium as Henriksen 's work " . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated " Roosters " 5 out of 5 , calling both it and " Owls " a " dense , deceptive set of shows " which focus on the personal and ideological conflicts between their characters . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five , calling it " dull and flabby " . Shearman felt that the plot failed to capitalise on what had been set up by " Owls " , offering more exposition than resolution . However , he highlighted the work of Thomas J. Wright , finding that those scenes which allowed for more action were directed well . 
 = Iowa Highway 56 = 
 Iowa Highway 56 ( Iowa 56 ) is a state highway that runs from west to east in northeastern Iowa . It begins at Iowa Highway 150 in West Union and ends at Iowa Highway 13 south of Elkader . As a largely rural route , Iowa 56 passes through the farmland of Fayette and Clayton counties . Through Elkader and to its eastern end , the highway runs parallel to the Turkey River . 
 The 24 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 39 km ) highway is an original route from 1920 . It originally extended from West Union to Guttenberg , but it was shortened to Elkader by 1925 . Since then , both the western and eastern endpoints have shifted slightly , but the route otherwise remains the same . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Iowa Highway 56 begins at an intersection with Iowa 150 in the southern part of West Union . The route starts out heading to the east , but turns to the south as it leaves the city limits . Approximately one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of town , it curves to the south @-@ southeast . Southeast of West Union , Iowa 56 splits the distance between the Volga River and Echo Valley state parks , each approximately two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from the highway . Being a largely rural route , it passes through the rolling farmland of Fayette and Clayton counties . 
 It continues to the south @-@ southeast until it nears Elkader . There , it briefly turns to the northeast before turning southeast again along Second Street parallel to the Turkey River . The street plan of Elkader was influenced by the river , which flows from the northwest to southeast through town . Iowa 56 follows Bridge Street for one block ; it heads to the southeast again along First Street . The highway meanders to the south , following the river , to an intersection with Iowa 13 near where that highway crosses the Turkey River . Clayton County 's Turkey River Park is located at the intersection of Iowa 13 and Iowa 56 .

 When the Iowa primary highway system was created in 1920 , Primary Road No. 56 extended from West Union eastward to Guttenberg . It began in a different location in West Union than it does today , beginning at Primary Road No. 19 in the northeastern part of town . The route then headed south along Pine Street . In Elkader , Primary Road No. 56 joined Primary Roads No. 10 and No. 13 and crossed the Turkey River on the Keystone Bridge . Shortly after leaving Elkader , Primary Road No. 56 split away from the other two routes and headed east . It turned south at Primary Road No. 20 and the two routes headed to Guttenberg . The Primary Road No. 56 designation ended in Guttenberg . 
 Primary Road No. 56 's length past Elkader did not last long . By 1925 , the two overlaps were removed and the standalone stretch between them was renumbered Primary Road . No. 128 . By the 1950s , the western end of the route shifted to its current position in West Union . In the early 1980s , a new bypass and Turkey River bridge were built around Elkader . Iowa 13 was shifted onto the bypass and Iowa 56 was extended southward along the former Iowa 13 to the new highway . In 2004 , the two intersections of Iowa 56 along Bridge Street were rebuilt to allow large trucks to take the sharp turns . <unk> began on June 1 and the street reopened on August 4 .

 " Per Manum " is the thirteenth episode of the eighth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on February 18 , 2001 . Written by Frank Spotnitz and series creator Chris Carter , and directed by Kim Manners , the episode helps to explore the series ' overarching mythology . " Per Manum " received a Nielsen rating of 9 @.@ 4 and was watched by 9 @.@ 61 million households . Overall , the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics . 
 The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) and her new partner John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) — following the alien abduction of her former partner , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) — who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Scully and Doggett investigate several women who had no way of naturally conceiving but who claim to have been abducted and impregnated with alien babies . Soon , Scully begins to worry about the future of her pregnancy . 
 " Per Manum " featured a substantial appearance by Duchovny who had elected not to return to the show as a full @-@ time main character following the ending of season seven . In addition , the episode marks the first appearance of Knowle Rohrer , played by Adam Baldwin . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Pregnant Kathy McCready is undergoing an emergency caesarian . As her husband prepares , the ward is locked down , and the child delivered is seen to be an alien . 
 FBI special agents John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) meet Duffy Haskell ( Jay Acovone ) , who tells them about his wife — a multiple @-@ abductee who he believes was killed by her doctors upon giving birth to an alien child . He also describes how his wife 's cancer was both caused and cured by her abductors . Duffy refers the agents to Zeus Genetics in Maryland , and shows them an ultrasound scan that seems to vindicate his story . As the agents leave , Doggett notes similarities between the case and Scully 's history , although he does not yet know that Scully is pregnant . In a flashback , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) tells Scully that her abduction ( in the second season episodes " Ascension and " One Breath " ) has rendered her infertile , as her ova were harvested for genetic experiments . Mulder later found them in a secret facility ( in fourth season 's " Memento Mori " ) , but they were not viable . 
 Scully investigates a Zeus Genetics clinic , overhearing a pregnant woman , Mary Hendershot ( Saxon Trainor ) , telling her doctor that she does not want to be under his care any more . Scully hides in a storeroom , finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier . In another flashback Scully seeks a second opinion about her ova from her doctor , Dr. Parenti , and is told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor . 
 In the present , Scully phones Parenti , who is dissecting an alien fetus . She asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier . When she visits later , she is assured her scans are in order , but she sees Parenti speaking with Dr. Lev , the doctor she overheard at Zeus Genetics . Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev . However , when the agents leave , Duffy makes a phone call to Lev , warning him that they are being investigated . Back in the past , Scully asks Mulder to be the donor and he accepts . 
 Scully is warned by Hendershot , the woman from Zeus Genetics , that their unborn children are in danger . Scully meets Doggett and Skinner , having requested a leave of absence from the FBI . After Doggett leaves , Skinner tries to convince Scully to reveal her pregnancy to Doggett . Scully and Hendershot visit an army research hospital to have Hendershot 's labor induced . Whilst Hendershot is being prepped for the operation , Scully asks to have an ultrasound performed on herself . The scan appears normal , but Scully realises the monitor they are watching is simply a video of another woman 's scan . Realising they have been tricked , Scully finds Hendershot and the two sneak out of the exam room . 
 Doggett has Duffy 's fingerprints examined , and finds that they belong to a man who died thirty years previously . Doggett contacts an old military partner , Knowle Rohrer ( Adam Baldwin ) to find Duffy 's real identity . Although Rohrer assures Doggett he will investigate , the agent is not convinced , believing that Duffy is a CIA agent . He confides this to Skinner , who tells him to aid Scully at the military hospital . As Scully and Hendershot sneak out of the building , they are found by Rohrer and several marines , claiming Doggett has sent them to rescue her . Scully and Hendershot are driven away , but Hendershot enters labour . The women are separated , and Scully is drugged . When she <unk> , Doggett informs her that Hendershot 's baby was delivered and is normal . However , Scully is convinced something is amiss , but nothing more can be done about it . In another flashback , Scully tells Mulder that her attempt at in vitro fertilization has failed , but he tells her to " never give up on a miracle " .

 " Per Manum " featured the appearance of David Duchovny as Fox Mulder in various flashbacks . After settling his contract dispute with Fox , Duchovny quit full @-@ time participation in the show after the seventh season . In order to explain Mulder 's absence , Duchovny 's character was abducted by aliens in the seventh season finale , " Requiem " . After several rounds of contractual discussions , Duchovny agreed to return for a total of 11 season eight episodes . " Per Manum " marked the fourth appearance of Duchovny in the eighth season ; he had previously appeared in opening episodes of the season , " Within " and " Without " as well as the eleventh episode " The Gift " . Series creator Chris Carter later argued that Mulder 's absences from the series did not affect the characterization , noting that " there are characters who can be powerful as absent centers , as Mulder was through the eighth and ninth seasons . " 
 A deleted scene from early on within the episode , in which Scully questions her doctor about her ultrasound scans , was cut from the final broadcast as writer Frank Spotnitz felt it was too " confusing " for the viewers to place doubt on the actions of the doctor so early . Fellow series writer John Shiban said that the scene was not " subtle " enough to convey the right level of suspicion . Spotnitz has described " Per Manum " as being " a real paranoia episode " , concerning " the way you perceive connections between people , what are they saying , and is it suspicious or not " . 
 Adam Baldwin , who makes his first appearance as recurring character Knowle Rohrer , originally auditioned for the part of John Doggett , losing out to Robert Patrick . However , the crew remembered Baldwin 's audition later when casting " Per Manum " , and asked him to play the role . Jay Acovone , who portrays Duffy Haskel in this episode , returned in the same role in the season 's penultimate episode " Essence " ; and had also previously appeared in the fourth season episode " Demons " . " Per Manum " also featured a guest appearance by Mark Snow as an unnamed doctor . Snow had been the series ' composer since the first season .

" The episode was later included on The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 4 – Super Soldiers , a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien super soldiers arc . 
 " Per Manum " received mostly positive reviews from critics . Todd VanDerWerff of The A. V. Club awarded the episode a " B + " and called it " good " . He appreciated the fact that the show revealed that Mulder was possibly the father of Scully 's child , saying that it " ups the stakes in a lot of ways and redefines [ Scully 's ] mission " to find Mulder . Despite this , VanDerWerff noted that the episode " has some issues " , largely due to the convoluted nature of the mythology at this point in the show 's run , as well as the fact that Duchovny looked " a little bored " at times . However , he wrote that the episode , along with the subsequent episode " This is Not Happening " was a showcase for Anderson 's acting ability , and her performance " knits all of this together " . Writing for Television Without Pity , Jessica Morgan rated the episode a " B + " , deriding some of the episode 's plot points , such as the hospital 's locking doors , and questioning the villainy of the antagonistic doctors . 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode five stars out of five , calling it a " return to form " for the series . Shearman and Pearson also felt that the episode gave the character of John Doggett a chance to be accepted by the series ' other characters ; and praised the " subtle " writing of the episode 's emotional dialogue . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations : An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6 @-@ 9 of ' The X @-@ Files ' , noted that the episode typifies the basic themes of the series — " dark , foreboding terror , overriding sense of paranoia " and " the fear of the unknown " among others . 
 Writing for The Vindicator , Eric Mink felt that the episode was " intense , unsettling , sometimes gross , and suspenseful to the point of nerve @-@ racking [ sic ] " , feeling that its plot would " resonate instantly and ominously with viewers " . Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that , while the episode did unfortunately reduce Scully down to a traditional idea of feminine identity for part of its run , it was " one of the most emotional Scully @-@ centric episodes the show has ever given us . " Furthermore , Deans reasoned that the episode was an example of " what The X @-@ Files would have been , had Scully been the believer : a woman being told that she is hysterical , a woman being told that she imagined it all [ and ] a woman being told that the evidence of her own body is invalid " , a direction that would have been " startling " . 
 Not all reviews were positive . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it no stars out of four . She heavily derided the plot , noting that Haskell 's role as an " undercover operative " was not convincing . Furthermore , she reasoned that because the plot twists were so expected , Scully came off as " a moron " . Vitaris also criticized the use of flashbacks , noting that they were " the only way The X @-@ Files writers could figure out to use David Duchovny " .

 Millennium Group consultant Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) runs out to a supermarket parking lot where he witnesses a lawyer , Alistair Pepper ( Richard Cox ) , being confronted by a man named Sammael ( Rodney Eastman ) . Sammael raises his hand , and a bolt of lightning arcs from his fingers to strike Pepper dead ; however , when Black reaches Sammael , he finds a pistol at the killer 's feet . 
 A few days before fellow Group member Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) investigates a murder in a suburban home , in which occult paraphernalia has been laid out in a disorganized manner . Watts contacts Black for help with the case . However , Black is still recovering from the murder of his friend Bob Bletcher ( Bill Smitrovich ) , who was murdered in Black 's home . Watts hangs up when he sees Sammael looking through the house 's window , but by the time he can investigate , Sammael is gone . 
 Watts later shows Black a picture taken at the murder scene , with Sammael recognizable among a crowd of people . Elsewhere , a man named Martin ( Guy <unk> ) is arrested after slitting a babysitter 's throat at a public park ; despite the seemingly random nature of the crime , Black believes that the man may be connected to Bletcher 's murder . However , he soon starts to suspect that Martin may be innocent of the crime he has been arrested for . Black also has a dream in which a mutilated Bletcher tries and fails to speak to him , which leads Black to believe he has lost his ability to see into the minds of others . 
 The case against Martin falters as evidence disappears and witnesses fail to identify him in a line @-@ up . Black is approached by Pepper , Martin 's self @-@ appointed lawyer , who extends Black an invitation to join his legal practice . Martin later claims in court to have killed Bletcher . Elsewhere , another Millennium Group member , Mike Atkins ( Robin Gammell ) , receives a telephone call from someone pretending to be Black . Meanwhile , Black suspects that the occult @-@ oriented murder may have been committed to draw the Group , and Black , into the open again . 
 In his jail cell , Martin cuts his own throat with a concealed razor blade ; however , a coroner later finds that his death was caused by an aneurysm . Black believes that Pepper is somehow involved . Watts and Black find Atkins murdered in a hotel room , and chase a suspect down a fire escape and into a supermarket . Inside , Black finds Pepper , but as Pepper moves in and out of view , his appearance seems to change to that of Martin , and then of Lucy Butler ( Sarah @-@ Jane Redmond ) , the woman Black suspects to have killed Bletcher . Pepper leaves the supermarket and approaches his car , where he is confronted and killed by Sammael . As Black apprehends Sammael , he is told that Pepper was killed as a " consequence of his own error " ; Black takes it to mean that there is a larger mystery to which his own involvement is only tangential .

" Powers , Principalities , Thrones and Dominions " is co @-@ writer Harold Rosenthal 's only credit throughout the series . 
 Both the title of the episode and the invocation spoken by the character of Sammael refer to four of the nine choirs of angels in Christian mythology . Christian <unk> holds that there are three groupings of three choirs each . The Thrones are the third @-@ highest ranking choir , belonging to the group charged with attending to God , and are described as stern incarnations of holy justice . Dominions , the fourth @-@ highest choir , belong to the group appointed to deal with God 's creations . Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity . Powers belong to the same tier as Dominions , and are tasked with countering the threat of temptation by the devil and demons . Principalities are the seventh @-@ highest ranking choir and belong to the lowest grouping of angels , those most likely to appear to mankind . Principalities oversee those humans who rule over others , teaching kings and heads of families the skills needed to lead . 
 " Powers , Principalities , Thrones and Dominions " features the final appearance of the character Bob Bletcher . Smitrovich had first portrayed Bletcher in " Pilot " , appearing intermittently throughout the first season . Bletcher was murdered in the previous episode , " Lamentation " . The episode also features the death of Millennium Group member Mike Atkins , played by Robin Gammell , who had also portrayed the character in the earlier episode " Gehenna " . Sarah @-@ Jane Redmond , who had first portrayed Lucy Butler in " Lamentation " , would return in the second season episode " A Room with No View " , and the third season episodes " Antipas " and " Saturn Dreaming of Mercury " .

 " Powers , Principalities , Thrones and Dominions " was first broadcast on the Fox Network on April 25 , 1997 . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6 @.@ 7 during its original broadcast , meaning that 6 @.@ 7 percent of households in the United States viewed the episode . This represented 6 @.@ 5 million households , and left the episode the sixty @-@ fifth most @-@ viewed broadcast that week . 
 " Powers , Principalities , Thrones and Dominions " received mostly positive reviews from critics . The A.V. Club 's Zack Handlen rated the episode an A , describing it as " gleefully grim " . Handlen felt that the episode represented the series coming into its own , noting that " Millennium , after weeks of hinting at possibilities without delivering much of anything , has finally started to give a real sense that yes , there is a lot of bad news happening , and it really does make a twisted kind of sense " . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated the episode 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 , noting that it shared similar themes with the direction the series would take in its second season . Gibron described the episode as " spooky and somewhat surreal " , adding that " the entire installment [ sic ] crackles with possibilities " . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " Powers , Principalities , Thrones and Dominions " four stars out of five , describing it as being " surprising , intriguing , moody and pretentious " . Shearman compared the episode thematically to Mann 's earlier script for " The Judge " , and noted that while the story " doesn 't make for an especially comprehensible yarn , it does produce an episode that is genuinely uneasy viewing " .

 The film is presumed lost as no known surviving copies of the film exist . A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World . It states : " Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends . Glade has a daughter , while Sears has a son . The young people have never met , being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship . As the two men own adjoining places , they believe that the best thing for the younger people to do is to get married . So they try to bring this about . Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation . Perhaps they would have married in the end , if the old folks hadn 't ' butted in .

 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . Identification of three members of the cast come from a surviving film still in a Thanhouser advertisement . Other credits may have included Anna Rosemond , one of two leading ladies of the Thanhouser company in this era . One of the actors in the film was Frank H. Crane , a leading male actor of the company and also involved since the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company . Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions .

 The one reel comedy , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on August 30 , 1910 . The film saw a wide national release , with advertisements in Kansas , Wisconsin , Pennsylvania , North Carolina , Nebraska , Arizona , and Oklahoma . The film was also shown by the Province Theatre in Vancouver , Canada . Though it had been released years prior to its examination by the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures , the film was approved without need any modifications or censoring . 
 The New York Dramatic Mirror review was positive despite the plot having been produced previously . The reviewer wrote , " This film story has been done before and by an Independent producer , which prompts the wonder if the Independents would not do well to avoid borrowing - at least from each other . The Thanhouser producers have the excuse , however , in this particular case that the former telling of the story was a sad failure , while this one has pleasing qualities . Two fathers are determined that their children shall wed each other , but the young folks object to such cut and dried procedure , <unk> the fathers pretend to quarrel and forbid the children to love , and the perverse youngsters at once elope , assisted secretly by the parents . The trick of having the boy join the girl in her apparent banishment by hiding in her trunk is the one discordant note in an otherwise plausible and human comedy . " The Moving Picture World was more brief , acknowledging the plausibility of the scenario and that the acting was convincing . The Moving Picture News review was also brief , stating , " The film calls for shrieks of laughter ; it deserved it , for it is built upon human nature . A story anyone can see and enjoy . " In 1912 , the American Film Manufacturing Company released the similarly titled An Assisted Elopement and the Selig Polyscope Company released its own An Assisted Elopement .

 The Simpsons Movie is a 2007 American animated comedy film based on the Fox television series The Simpsons . The film was directed by David Silverman , and stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta , Julie Kavner , Nancy Cartwright , Yeardley Smith , Hank Azaria , Harry Shearer , Tress MacNeille , Pamela Hayden , Marcia Wallace , and Russi Taylor with guest appearances by Tom Hanks , Green Day , and Albert Brooks . The plot follows Homer Simpson , whose irresponsibility gets the better of him when he pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town cleans it up when they had received a warning from the EPA . As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him , Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill , the head of the EPA , when he intends to destroy Springfield . 
 Previous attempts to create a film version of The Simpsons failed due to the lack of a script of appropriate length and production crew members . Eventually , producers James L. Brooks , Matt Groening , Al Jean , Mike Scully , and Richard Sakai began development of the film in 2001 . A writing team consisting of Scully , Jean , Brooks , Groening , George Meyer , David Mirkin , Mike Reiss , John Swartzwelder , Jon Vitti , Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , and Matt Selman was assembled . They conceived numerous plot ideas , with Groening 's being the one developed into a film . The script was re @-@ written over a hundred times , and this creativity continued after the animation had begun in 2006 . This meant hours of finished material was cut , which included cameo roles from Erin Brockovich , Minnie Driver , Isla Fisher , Kelsey Grammer , and Edward Norton . Hanks and Green Day appeared in the final cut as themselves . 
 Tie @-@ in promotions were made with several companies , including Burger King and 7 @-@ Eleven , which transformed selected stores into Kwik @-@ E @-@ Marts . The film premiered in Springfield , Vermont , which had won the right to hold it through a competition organized by Fox . The film was a critical and commercial success , grossing over $ 527 million worldwide . 
 = = Plot = = 
 While performing on Lake Springfield , rock band Green Day is killed when the lake 's pollution dissolves their barge , following an audience revolt after frontman Billie Joe Armstrong proposes an environmental discussion . At the memorial service , Grampa Simpson ( Castellaneta ) foresees the destruction of the town , but only Marge takes this seriously . Later that day , Homer dares his son Bart to skate naked to the Krusty Burger restaurant and Bart is arrested by Chief Wiggum ( Hank Azaria ) . Bart considers their neighbor Ned Flanders ( Harry Shearer ) a better father figure after Homer refuses to take responsibility for the incident . Lisa and a new Irish friend named Colin ( Tress MacNeille ) convince the town to clean the lake . 
 Meanwhile , Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and names it " Spider Pig " ( later " Harry Plopper " , and simply " Plopper " ) , and stores the pig 's feces ( and some of his own ) in a silo , until Marge tells him to safely dispose of the waste . Homer intends to take his silo to the waste management plant , but after Lenny ( Shearer ) calls to tell him that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down and is giving away free donuts , Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake , polluting it again . Moments later , a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated ; Flanders and Bart ( who bond after Homer humiliates Bart ) discover the creature before the EPA captures it . Russ Cargill ( Albert Brooks ) , head of the EPA , presents five " unthinkable " options to U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger ( Harry Shearer ) to keep the town 's pollution contained ; he steers the slow @-@ witted president into enclosing Springfield in a large glass dome . When the police discover Homer 's silo in the lake , and his responsibility for sealing Springfield in the dome , an angry mob advances on the Simpsons ' home to kill Homer , but the family escapes the town through a sinkhole , which then destroys their house . With the EPA on their trail , the Simpsons flee to Alaska . On the way , Homer tries to make some money at a carnival by riding a motorcycle around the inside of a metal cage . 
 After weeks of futile escape attempts , Springfield 's residents finally make a dent in the dome ; pointing out the damage , Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town 's destruction . In Alaska , the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield ; realizing the town is endangered , Marge and the children want to go back to save it , but Homer refuses . The family eventually leave him for good . Alone , Homer is adrift on an iceberg , while Marge and the children are captured by the EPA after they are discovered by the NSA and Marge didn 't stay silent and blowing her and her family 's cover . After a mysterious Inuit shaman ( MacNeille ) saves him from a polar bear , Homer has an epiphany and decides to return to Springfield to save the town from danger . 
 As Homer arrives , a helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope through a hole in the dome , set to go off after 15 minutes . Homer goes down the rope , knocking the escaping townspeople and bomb off of it which gets him booed away . After reconciling with Bart , Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome , inspired by the earlier carnival attraction . As a passenger of the motorcycle , Bart throws the bomb through the hole ; seconds later it detonates , shattering the dome and freeing the town . Cargill prepares to shoot Homer and Bart , but Maggie knocks him out with a boulder . The town praises Homer , who rides into the sunset with Marge and Maggie , whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal . As a symbol of their gratitude , the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family 's house .

 The production staff had considered a film adaptation of The Simpsons since early in the series . The show 's creator , Matt Groening , felt a feature @-@ length film would allow them to increase the show 's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series . He intended the film to be made after the show ended , " but that [ ... ] was undone by good ratings " . There were attempts to adapt the fourth season episode " Kamp Krusty " into a film , but difficulties were encountered in expanding the episode to feature @-@ length . For a long time the project was held up . There was difficulty finding a story that was sufficient for a film , and the crew did not have enough time to complete such a project , as they already worked full @-@ time on the show . Groening also expressed a wish to make Simpstasia , a parody of Fantasia ; it was never produced , partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature @-@ length script . Before his death , Phil Hartman had said he had wished to make a live action Troy McClure film , and several of the show 's staff had expressed a desire to help create it . 
 The voice cast was signed on to do the film in 2001 , and work then began on the script . The producers were initially worried that creating a film would have a negative effect on the series , as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects . As the series progressed , additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time . Groening and James L. Brooks invited back Mike Scully and Al Jean ( who continued to work as showrunner on the television series ) to produce the film with them . They then signed David Silverman ( who , in anticipation of the project , had quit his job at Pixar ) to direct the film . The " strongest possible " writing team was assembled , with many of the writers from the show 's early seasons being chosen . David Mirkin , Mike Reiss , George Meyer , John Swartzwelder , and Jon Vitti were selected . Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham and Matt Selman joined later , and Brooks , Groening , Scully , and Jean also wrote parts of the script . Sam Simon did not return having left the show over creative differences in 1993 . Former writer Conan O 'Brien wanted to work with the Simpsons staff again , joking that " I worry that the Simpsons @-@ writing portion of my brain has been destroyed after 14 years of talking to Lindsay Lohan and that guy from One Tree Hill , so maybe it 's all for the best . " The same went for director Brad Bird who said he had " entertained fantasies of asking if [ he ] could work on the movie " , but did not have enough time due to work on Ratatouille . The producers arranged a deal with Fox that would allow them to abandon production of the film at any point if they felt the script was unsatisfactory . 
 Work continued on the screenplay from 2003 onwards , taking place in the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987 . The writers spent six months discussing a plot , and each of them offered sketchy ideas . Jean suggested the family rescue manatees , which became the 2005 episode " The Bonfire of the Manatees " , and there was also a notion similar to that of The Truman Show where the characters discovered their lives were a TV show . Groening rejected this , as he felt that the Simpsons should " never become aware of themselves as celebrities " . Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply , which inspired the plot of the film . The decision for Flanders to have an important role also came early on , as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father . Having eventually decided on the basic outline of the plot for the film , the writers then separated it into seven sections . Jean , Scully , Reiss , Swartzwelder , Vitti , Mirkin , and Meyer wrote 25 pages each , and the group met one month later to merge the seven sections into one " very rough draft " . The film 's script was written in the same way as the television series : the writers sitting around a table , pitching ideas , and trying to make each other laugh . The script went through over 100 revisions , and at one point the film was a musical . However , the songs were continually being shortened and the idea was dropped . Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode , saying that he wanted to " give you something that you haven 't seen before " . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 Animation for the film began in January 2006 , with the Itchy & Scratchy short being the first scene to be storyboarded . Groening rejected making either a live @-@ action or a CGI film , calling the film 's animation " deliberately imperfect " and " a tribute to the art of hand @-@ drawn animation " . The film was produced in a widescreen 2 @.@ 35 : 1 aspect ratio , to distinguish it from the look of the television series , and colored with the largest palette the animators had ever had available to them . A lot of the animation was produced using Wacom Cintiq tablets , which allowed images to be drawn directly onto a computer monitor to facilitate production . Animation production work was divided among four studios around the world : Film Roman in Burbank , California , Rough Draft Studios in Glendale , California , and AKOM and Rough Draft 's division in Seoul , South Korea . As with the television series , the storyboarding , characters , background layout , and animatic parts of production , were done in America . The overseas studios completed the inbetweening , digital ink and paint , and rendered the animation to tape before being shipped back to the United States . 
 Director David Silverman said that unlike the TV series where " you [ have ] to pick and choose " , the film gave them the opportunity to " lavish that attention [ on ] every single scene " . The characters have shadows , unlike in the show . Silverman and the animators looked to films such as The Incredibles , The Triplets of Belleville , and Bad Day at Black Rock for inspiration , as they were " a great education in staging because of how the characters are placed " . They also looked for ideas for a dream sequence , in Disney films such as Dumbo and the Pluto cartoon Pluto 's Judgment Day , and for crowd scenes in It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World . Silverman looked at some of the Simpsons episodes he had directed , primarily his two favorites , " Homie the Clown " and " Three Men and a Comic Book " . Mike B. Anderson , Lauren MacMullan , Rich Moore , and Steven Dean Moore each directed the animation for around a quarter of the film under Silverman 's supervision , with numerous other animators working on scenes . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 For inspiration for the crowd scenes in the film , the production staff referenced a poster featuring more than 320 Simpsons characters . Groening said they tried to include every single character in the film , with 98 having speaking parts , and most members of the crowds being previously established characters instead of generic people . The series ' regular voice actors : Dan Castellaneta , Julie Kavner , Nancy Cartwright , Yeardley Smith , Hank Azaria , and Harry Shearer , as well as semi @-@ regular performers Tress MacNeille , Pamela Hayden , Marcia Wallace , Maggie Roswell , Russi Taylor , and Karl Wiedergott , reprised their roles . Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony , while Albert Brooks , who supplied many guest voices in episodes , was hired as Russ Cargill , after he told the staff that he wanted to be part of the film . For " about a week " , he was to reprise the role of Hank Scorpio from the episode " You Only Move Twice " , but the staff felt that creating a new character was a better idea . 
 The cast did the first of three table readings in May 2005 , and began recording every week from June 2006 until the end of production . James L. Brooks directed them for the first time since the television show 's early seasons . Castellaneta found the recording sessions " more intense " than recording the television series , and " more emotionally dramatic " . Some scenes , such as Marge 's video message to Homer , were recorded over one hundred times , leaving the voice cast exhausted . 
 The writers had written the opening concert scene without a specific band in mind . Green Day were cast in that role having requested to guest star in the show . Tom Hanks also appears as himself in the film and accepted the offer after just one phone call . Everybody Loves Raymond creator Philip Rosenthal provides the voice of the father in the " new Grand Canyon " commercial with Hanks . Due to time restraints , several guests who had recorded parts were cut from the film . Minnie Driver recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that ended up being cut . Edward Norton recorded the part of the man who gets crushed as the dome is implemented , performing a Woody Allen impression . The staff felt the voice was too distracting , so Castellaneta re @-@ recorded Norton 's dialogue with a different voice . Isla Fisher and Erin Brockovich also recorded cameos , but their scenes were cut . Kelsey Grammer recorded lines for Sideshow Bob , who was to appear at several different points , but these scenes were also cut . Johnny Knoxville was also touted as a possible guest star . 
 Although he does not provide the voice , Arnold Schwarzenegger is President of the United States rather than then @-@ President George W. Bush because , according to Groening , " in two years ... the film [ would be ] out of date " . Brooks was nervous about the idea , noting that " [ Schwarzenegger 's ] opinion polls were way down " , and has said that they " were [ hoping ] he 'd make a political comeback " . The animators began by drawing an accurate caricature of Schwarzenegger , but one of the staff instead suggested an altered version of recurring character Rainier Wolfcastle as President . This idea was developed , with the design of Wolfcastle , himself also a caricature of Schwarzenegger , being given more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle . 
 = = = Editing = = = 
 Every aspect of the film was constantly analyzed , with storylines , jokes , and characters regularly being rewritten . Although most animated films do not make extensive changes to the film during active production due to budget restrictions , The Simpsons Movie crew continued to edit their film into 2007 , with some edits taking place as late as May , two months before the film was released . James L. Brooks noted , " 70 percent of the things in [ one of the trailers ] — based on where we were eight weeks ago — are no longer in the movie . " Groening said that enough material for two more movies was cut . Various new characters were created , and then cut because they did not contribute enough . Originally Marge was the character who had the prophetic vision in church . The writers however considered this to be too dark and it was changed to Grampa . The role of Lisa 's love interest Colin was frequently revised . He was previously named Dexter and Adrien , and his appearance was completely altered . One idea was to have Milhouse act as Lisa 's love interest , but the writers realized " the audience was not as familiar with [ his ] long @-@ standing crush on [ Lisa ] as [ they had ] thought " . A car chase in which Homer throws flaming mummies out of a truck at the EPA was replaced with " more emotional and realistic " scenes at the motel and carnival that allowed for a change of pace . 
 Further changes were made after the March 2007 preview screenings of the film in Portland , Oregon and Phoenix , Arizona . This included the deletion of Kang and Kodos heavily criticizing the film during the end credits . A lot of people at the screenings found the original film too coarse , and some of Homer 's behavior too unkind , so several scenes were toned down to make him appear nicer . Russ Cargill was redesigned several times , originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns Albert Brooks based on Donald Rumsfeld . The older model was the one used by Burger King for the action figure . Cargill 's scene with Bart and Homer at the film 's conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story , and the " Spider @-@ Pig " gag was also a late addition . One excised scene , before the dome is put over Springfield , had Mr. Burns reminding viewers that it was the last point in the film that they could get a refund . Other deletions included Homer 's encounter with a sausage truck driver , which was featured on the DVD , a scene with Plopper the pig at the end , and a news report , showing the dome 's effect on daily life in Springfield in areas such as farming and sport , was cut because it did not fit the overall context of the film . Several musical numbers , at various intervals throughout the film , were cut . These included a song about Alaska , featuring music by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics . Jean said it " got pretty far along in the animation , and then we got scared that the movie began to drag in that section . " 
 = = = Music = = = 
 James L. Brooks chose Hans Zimmer to compose the film 's score , as they were good friends and regular collaborators . Zimmer felt that the score was a " unique challenge " , and he had to " try and express the style of The Simpsons without wearing the audience out " . He used Danny Elfman 's original opening theme , but did not wish to overuse it . He created themes for each member of the family . Homer 's leitmotif was a major focus , and Zimmer also composed smaller themes for Bart and Marge . Regular television series composer Alf Clausen was not asked to score the film , noting : " sometimes you 're the windshield , sometimes you 're the bug " . 
 In addition to their appearance in the film , Green Day recorded its own version of the Simpsons theme , and released it as a single . Zimmer turned the Spider @-@ Pig song into a choral piece , which was a joke he never intended to be put into the film . Zimmer also had to write foreign @-@ language lyrics for the 32 dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally . He found translating the song into Spanish the hardest to write . The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the foreign @-@ language dubs . 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 Al Jean described the film 's message as being " a man should listen to his wife " . In addition , the film parodies two major contemporary issues , religion and environmentalism . The theme of environmentalism is present throughout the film : in Homer 's polluting of Lake Springfield , Green Day 's cameo , Lisa 's activism and her romance with Colin . The villainous Russ Cargill is head of the Environmental Protection Agency . Reviewer Ed Gonzalez argued the plot was a satire of the government 's reaction to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans . Ian Nathan of Empire magazine criticized this focus , believing it gave the film an " overt political agenda [ which ] border [ s ] on polemic " . James D. Bloom of Muhlenberg College commented on the " explicitness " of the film 's " intellectual agenda " , on this issue , shown particularly through Lisa . He wrote that the film 's first post @-@ opening credits scene , which sees Green Day fail in an attempt to engage their audience on the issue of the environment , " sets in motion a plot expressly built around cultural agenda @-@ setting " and " reflection on timely ' issues ' . " 
 Religion is focused on in Grampa 's momentary possession , and Marge believing what he said to be a message from God . Groening joked the film " posit [ s ] the existence of a very active God " , when asked if he believed it was likely to offend . Mark I. Pinsky , author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons , said the film " treats genuine faith with respect , while keeping a sharp eye out for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds " . Regarding the scene where the tenants of Moe 's Tavern and the Church switch locations , he believed it took the " chance to unmask everyone 's human fallibility . " In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders , he wrote , " It is [ the ] willingness of The Simpsons to depict all the different sides of us [ ... ] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated relationship with religion . " Trees are a motif in the film , and they were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout the film . The animators inserted an apple tree behind Lisa and Colin during their initial meeting , a reference to the biblical figures of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Many cultural references and allusions are made throughout the film . Green Day play " Nearer , My God , to Thee " on violins as their barge sinks , in a sequence parodying the film Titanic . When Bart is riding his skateboard naked , different passing objects are constantly covering his genitalia , a nod to similar techniques used in Austin Powers : International Man of Mystery . Homer and Marge 's love scene parodies many Disney films , including Cinderella , with Disney @-@ style animals helping them undress . Originally , the music from The Wizard of Oz was used in that scene , and the fawn had white spots ; these were removed because the animators felt it resembled Bambi too clearly . Bart impersonates Mickey Mouse on the train , calling himself " the mascot of an evil corporation " . Homer plays Grand Theft Walrus , an allusion to the video game series Grand Theft Auto . In the game , his character shoots a tap @-@ dancing penguin in reference to the film Happy Feet . The " Spider @-@ Pig " song is a parody of the theme song of the 1967 Spider @-@ Man TV series , and the name of Lisa 's lecture is An Irritating Truth , a play on Al Gore 's film An Inconvenient Truth . The bomb disposal robot was based on Vincent D 'Onofrio 's character Leonard " Pyle " Lawrence from the film Full Metal Jacket , who commits suicide in a similar way . At the end of the film , the crowd 's celebration is similar to the conclusion of Return of the Jedi , with Carl performing exactly the same hand gestures as Lando Calrissian . 
 The $ 1 @,@ 000 Homer received when entering Alaska is a reference to the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend . As Homer leaves Eski @-@ Moe 's he grabs on to a passing truck and uses it to propel himself back to the house , a tribute to actor Buster Keaton , while the epiphany scene features homages to the film Brazil and the works of Salvador Dalí . Hillary Clinton appears as Itchy 's vice president , while an Orc from The Lord of the Rings appears in the mob scene . A scene that was cut had Marge and the kids appear on the TV talk show The View to spread the news of Springfield 's impending doom . Parts were written for the show 's entire panel and the scene was planned to feature Russ Cargill having a gunfight with Joy Behar . Another dropped scene featured Moe describing Springfield 's varying physical states inside the dome , one of which was the Disneyland ride <unk> . There are several references to events in previous TV episodes of The Simpsons . These include the wreckage of the ambulance from the episode " Bart the Daredevil " crashed into a tree next to Springfield Gorge . The Carpenters ' song " ( They Long to Be ) Close to You " was used in Homer and Marge 's wedding video and had also been used in several emotional moments between them in the TV series .

 20th Century Fox announced on April 1 , 2006 that the film would be released worldwide on July 27 , 2007 . The film was released a day earlier in Australia and the United Kingdom . Little information about the plot was released in the weeks building up to the film 's release . Groening did not feel that " people look in the TV section of the newspaper and think , ' I 'll watch this week 's Simpsons because I like the plot . ' You just tune in and see what happens . "

 The Simpsons Movie received critical acclaim . The film currently holds an 88 % approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 219 reviews , with an average rating of 7 @.@ 5 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , " The Simpsons Movie contains the hearty laughs , biting satire , and honest portrayal of an American family that makes the show so popular . And it boasts slicker animation and polished writing that hearkens back to the show 's glory days . " On Metacritic , it received a score of 80 out of 100 , based on 36 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . 
 British newspapers The Guardian and The Times both gave the film four out of five stars . The Times ' James Bone said that it " boasts the same sly cultural references and flashes of brilliance that have earned the television series a following that ranges from tots to comparative literature PhDs " . The Guardian 's Peter Bradshaw stated that it " gives you everything you could possibly want " and that he thought , " Eighty @-@ five minutes [ was ] not long enough to do justice to 17 years of comedy genius " . Ed Gonzalez praised the film for its political message , likening the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon at the beginning to President Schwarzenegger 's situation later on , as well as the film 's visual gags . Randy Shulman praised the cast , and described them as having " elevated their vocal work to a craft that goes way beyond simple line readings " , and particularly praised Kavner who he said " gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever " . Roger Ebert gave a positive review , but admitted he was " generally [ not ] a fan of movies spun off from TV animation " . He called it " radical and simple at the same time , subversive and good @-@ hearted , offensive without really meaning to be " . Richard Corliss of Time said that the film " doesn 't try to be ruder or <unk> , just bigger and better " . 
 USA Today film critic Claudia Puig said that the story did " warrant a full @-@ length feature , thanks to a clever plot and non @-@ stop irreverent humor " . Patrick Kolan believed that the film was " easily the best stuff to come [ from the Simpsons ] since season 12 or 13 " and praised the animation , but also said that the appearances of characters such as Comic Book Guy and Seymour Skinner were " small and unfunny " . Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film 's good nature , stating that the laughs " come in all sizes " , but also noted that , " little has been gained bringing the Simpsons to the screen . " 
 Variety 's Brian Lowry called it " clever , irreverent , satirical and outfitted " but that it was " just barely " capable of sustaining a running time longer than a television episode . Lisa Schwarzbaum praised the voice cast but stated that the " ' action ' sequences sometimes falter " . When comparing the film to the early episodes of the show , Stephen Rowley concluded that the film " has more going for it than the show in its later years , but is still a long way short of what made it so invigorating " . The Monthly critic Luke Davies echoed Lowry 's concerns about the length : " everything moves with the whip @-@ crack speed of a half @-@ hour episode . And that 's the paradox : it makes the film feel like three episodes strung together . We 're in a cinema , and we expect something epic . " He opined that " in the great arc that is the history of The Simpsons , this film will come to be seen as oddity rather than apotheosis . " 
 More negative reception came from the magazine Empire , where reviewer Ian Nathan compared the film to New Coke , saying that " it utterly failed " . Phil Villarreal believed that there were " too few laugh @-@ worthy moments " and that " instead of stretching to new frontiers , the film rests on the familiar " . Sheila Johnston criticized the pacing of the film and its joke level saying that " the overall momentum flags at times " and that it was " a salvo of comic squibs , some very funny , others limp " . David Edwards agreed with this , writing that although " there 's a great half @-@ hour show rattling around ... the rest is padding at its very dullest " , concluding that it " isn 't a terrible film , just a terribly disappointing one . " Cosmo Landesman believed , " the humour seem [ ed ] to have lost its satirical bite and wit " and that " much of the comedy is structured around the idiocy of Homer " . This assessment was shared by Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times , who felt that " once the movie wanders into its contemplation of mortality and meaning , the <unk> kind of creaks and falls off . " She negatively compared it to South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut ( 1999 ) , a film similarly adapted from an animated television series , saying that , in terms of satire , it offers " nothing we don 't hear every night on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . " Bruce Newman criticized the fleeting appearances of many of the show 's secondary characters , and found the film to be " a disappointment " .

 In January 2015 , just prior to the broadcast of the episode " The Man Who Came to Be Dinner " , Al Jean and David Mirkin took to Twitter to reveal that the episode ( which had been produced in 2012 and was originally set to air on May 19 , 2013 ) had been held back because it was being " seriously considered " for adaptation into a sequel film as the episode was " very cinematic " ; they cited a similar sequence of events that occurred earlier in the show 's run with the episode " Kamp Krusty " . Jean also stated that he was sure reasons the episode both could and wouldn 't work as a film would occur to those that viewed the episode and later expanded that there was the fear of the potential film being considered " not canonical " with the TV series and the potential backlash of overcoming it by using a " memory wipe " .

 = Military history of Australia during World War I = 
 In Australia , the outbreak of World War I was greeted with considerable enthusiasm . Even before Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914 , the nation pledged its support alongside other states of the British Empire and almost immediately began preparations to send forces overseas to participate in the conflict . The first campaign that Australians were involved in was in German New Guinea after a hastily raised force known as the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force was dispatched from Australia to seize German possessions in the Pacific in September 1914 . At the same time another expeditionary force , initially consisting of 20 @,@ 000 men and known as the First Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) , was raised for service overseas . 
 The AIF departed Australia in November 1914 and , after several delays due to the presence of German naval vessels in the Indian Ocean , arrived in Egypt , where they were initially used to defend the Suez Canal . In early 1915 , however , it was decided to carry out an amphibious landing on the Gallipoli peninsula with the goal of opening up a second front and securing the passage of the Dardanelles . The Australians and New Zealanders , grouped together as the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) , went ashore on 25 April 1915 and for the next eight months the Anzacs , alongside their British , French and other allies , fought a costly and ultimately unsuccessful campaign against the Turks . 
 The force was evacuated from the peninsula in December 1915 and returned to Egypt , where the AIF was expanded . In early 1916 it was decided that the infantry divisions would be sent to France , where they took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front . Most of the light horse units remained in the Middle East until the end of the war , carrying out further operations against the Turks in Egypt and Palestine . Small numbers of Australians served in other theatres of war . While the main focus of the Australian military 's effort was the ground war , air and naval forces were also committed . Squadrons of the Australian Flying Corps served in the Middle East and on the Western Front , while elements of the Royal Australian Navy carried out operations in the Atlantic , North Sea , Adriatic and Black Sea , as well as the Pacific and Indian Oceans . 
 By the end of the war , Australians were far more circumspect . The nation 's involvement cost more than 60 @,@ 000 Australian lives and many more were left unable to work as a result of their injuries . The impact of the war was felt in many other areas as well . Financially it was very costly , while the effect on the social and political landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation 's social fabric . Conscription was possibly the most contentious issue and ultimately , despite having conscription for home service , Australia was one of only two combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting . Nevertheless , for many Australians the nation 's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor , while many of the notions of the Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday . 
 = = Outbreak of the war = = 
 Following Britain 's declaration of war on Germany on 4 August 1914 , Australia and the other members of the British Empire became automatically involved , with Prime Minister Joseph Cook stating on 5 August 1914 that " ... when the Empire is at war , so also is Australia . " Given the predominantly British heritage of most Australians at the time , there was considerable support from all corners of the country and large numbers of young Australian men reported to recruiting centres around the country to enlist in the following months . When Prime Minister Andrew Fisher 's Labor Party came to power in September 1914 , he reiterated Cook 's statement saying , " Should the worst happen ... " , Australia would " ... rally to the Mother Country ... to help and defend her to our last man and our last shilling . " 
 Within days , plans for an Australian expeditionary force were completed by Brigadier General William Throsby Bridges and his staff officer , Major Cyril Brudenell Bingham White . White proposed a force of 18 @,@ 000 men ( 12 @,@ 000 Australians and 6 @,@ 000 New Zealanders ) . This proposal was approved by Prime Minister Cook but he increased the offer to the British to 20 @,@ 000 men to serve in any destination desired by the Home Government . On 6 August 1914 , London cabled its acceptance of the force and asked that it be sent as soon as possible . Recruiting offices opened on 10 August 1914 and by the end of 1914 , 52 @,@ 561 volunteers had been accepted , although strict physical fitness guidelines were put in place . 
 = = German New Guinea = = 
 In 1884 , Germany had colonised the north eastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups . By the outbreak of the war , the Germans had been using the colony as a wireless radio base , and supporting the German East Asia Squadron which threatened merchant shipping in the region . As a consequence , Britain required the wireless installations to be destroyed . Shortly after the outbreak of war — following a request by the British government on 6 August 1914 — the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force ( AN & MEF ) began forming . The objectives of the force were the German stations at Yap in the Caroline Islands , Nauru and at Rabaul , New Britain . The AN & MEF comprised one battalion of infantry ( 1 @,@ 023 men ) enlisted in Sydney , 500 naval reservists and ex @-@ sailors organised into six companies who would serve as infantry and a further 500 men from the Kennedy Regiment , a Queensland militia battalion that had volunteered for overseas service and had been sent to garrison Thursday Island . Together , these forces were placed under the command of Colonel William Holmes , an officer in the militia who was at the time commander of the 6th Brigade and secretary of the Sydney Water and Sewerage Board . 
 The task force sailed from Sydney on 19 August 1914 , and hove to off Port Moresby where they waited for their escorts to arrive . While they were at Port Moresby , Holmes decided to disembark the Queensland militia soldiers due to concerns about their preparedness for action . Escorted by the cruiser Sydney and the battlecruiser Australia , the task force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and found that the port was free of German forces . Sydney and the destroyer HMAS Warrego landed small parties of naval reservists at the settlements of Kabakaul and the German gubernatorial capital Herbertshöhe on Neu @-@ Pommern , south @-@ east of Rabaul . These parties were reinforced first by sailors from HMAS Warrego and HMAS Yarra and later by infantry from the transport HMAS Berrima . 
 A small 25 @-@ man force of naval reservists was subsequently landed at Kabakaul Bay and continued inland to capture the radio station believed to be in operation at Bita Paka , 4 miles ( 7 km ) to the south . The Australians were resisted by a mixed force of German reservists and Melanesian native police , who forced them to fight their way to the radio station . By nightfall , the radio station was reached and it was found to have been abandoned , the mast dropped but its instruments and machinery intact . During the Battle of Bita Paka six Australians were killed and five wounded , while the defenders lost one German non @-@ commissioned officer ( NCO ) and about 30 Melanesians killed , and one German and ten Melanesians wounded . Later it was alleged that the heavy losses among the Melanesian troops was the result of the Australians bayoneting all those they had captured during the fighting . As a result of this engagement , Able Seaman <unk> Williams became the first Australian fatality of the war . The first Army fatality was a medical officer , Captain B. C. A. <unk> , who died the same day . 
 At nightfall on 12 September , the Berrima landed the AN & MEF infantry battalion at Rabaul . The following afternoon , although the governor had not yet surrendered the territory , a ceremony was carried out to signal the British occupation of New Britain . The German administration had withdrawn inland to Toma and at dawn on 14 September , and HMAS Encounter subsequently bombarded a ridge near the town , while half a battalion advanced towards the town supported by a field gun . The show of firepower was sufficient to start negotiations , ending the Siege of Toma following the surrender of the remaining garrison of 40 Germans and 110 native police . The German territory surrendered on 17 September 1914 . 
 Although successful the operation was arguably not well managed , and the Australians had been effectively delayed by a half @-@ trained native force . Regardless the Australians had prevailed not least of all because of their unexpected ability to fight in close terrain , while the outflanking of the German positions had unnerved their opponents . The losses of the AN & MEF were light in the context of later operations but were sufficiently heavy given the relatively modest gain . These losses were further compounded by the unexplained disappearance of the Australian submarine HMAS AE1 during a patrol off Rabaul on 14 September , with 35 men aboard . 
 Following the capture of German possessions in the region , the AN & MEF provided occupation forces for the duration of the war . On 9 January 1915 , Holmes handed over command of the AN & MEF to Brigadier General Sir Samuel Pethebridge , the former Secretary of the Department of Defence . Holmes returned to Australia and re @-@ enlisted in the AIF , as did most of his men . They were replaced by the 3rd Battalion , known as the " Tropical Force " because it had been specially enlisted for service in the tropics . Pethebridge established the administrative structures that remained through the period of military occupation . Although required by international law to follow the German forms of government , the territory gradually acquired the appearance of a British colony . 
 = = First Australian Imperial Force = = 
 At the start of the war , Australia 's military forces were focused upon the militia and what Regular forces existed were mostly serving in the artillery or engineers and were assigned in most part to the task of coastal defence . Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 , which precluded sending conscripts overseas , upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate , all volunteer force would need to be raised . This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) . 
 The AIF began forming shortly after the outbreak of war and was the brain child of Bridges and White . Upon formation , the AIF consisted of only one infantry division , the 1st Division , and the 1st Light Horse Brigade . The 1st Division was made up of the 1st Infantry Brigade under Colonel Henry MacLaurin ; the 2nd , under Colonel James Whiteside McCay , an Australian politician and former Minister for Defence ; and the 3rd , under Colonel Ewen Sinclair @-@ Maclagan , a British regular officer seconded to the Australian Army before the war . The 1st Light Horse Brigade was commanded by Colonel Harry Chauvel , an Australian regular , while the divisional artillery was commanded by Colonel Talbot Hobbs . 
 In the early stages of mobilisation the men of the AIF were selected under some of the toughest criterion of any army in World War I and it is believed that roughly 30 per cent of men that applied were rejected on medical grounds . In order to enlist , men had to be aged between 18 and 35 years of age ( although it is believed that men as old as 70 and as young as 14 managed to enlist ) , and they had to be at least five foot six inches tall ( 168 centimetres ) , with a chest measurement of at least 34 inches ( 86 centimetres ) . Many of these strict requirements were lifted later in the war , however , as the need for replacements grew . Indeed , casualties among the initial volunteers were so high , that of the 32 @,@ 000 original soldiers of the AIF only 7 @,@ 000 would survive to the end of the war . 
 The initial response was so good that in September 1914 the decision was made to raise the 4th Infantry Brigade and 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades . The 4th Infantry Brigade was commanded by Colonel John Monash , a prominent Melbourne civil engineer and businessman . The AIF continued to grow through the war , eventually numbering five infantry divisions , two mounted divisions and a mixture of other units . A sixth infantry division , the 6th Division , was partially formed in the United Kingdom February 1917 . Casualties from the First Battle of Bullecourt and the Battle of Messines caused the disbandment of the partially formed unit to allow the other five divisions to be brought back up to strength . 
 = = Gallipoli = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The 1st Division departed Australia from Albany , Western Australia on 1 November 1914 in convoy of 10 transports escorted by several British , Australian and Japanese warships . Initially bound for British @-@ controlled Egypt , with a stopover in Ceylon , the convoy had been delayed several times due to fears of interception by German warships in the area . These fears later proved valid when the German cruiser Emden was sighted off Cocos Island . As the convoy steered to avoid the threat , the Australian cruiser HMAS Sydney , engaged the Emden with her heavier guns and after an engagement that lasted only twenty @-@ five minutes , the Sydney emerged victorious . 
 The threat of the German Squadron neutralised , the convoy was able to continue its voyage unmolested . Upon their arrival in Egypt in November , the 1st Division moved to Camp Mena , near Cairo , where they were used to defend the Suez Canal against Turkey who had declared war on 29 October . During this time , the Australians commenced a period of training to prepare them for combat on the Western Front as it was still expected that they would be sent to England for deployment in the European theatre . As they waited , however , the Australian and New Zealand forces in Egypt at the time were formed into the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) under the command of Lieutenant General William Birdwood , and consisting of the Australian 1st Division and the composite New Zealand and Australian Division ( NZ & A ) . 
 Overcrowding and shortages of equipment in England meant that it was decided to keep the Anzacs in Egypt during the European winter , during which time they would undertake further training in order to prepare them for their eventual use in the trenches in France . Despite this , however , the training that the Australians and New Zealanders received in this time could only be considered very rudimentary in nature , and despite popular opinion at the time , it did little to prepare them for what was to come . 
 In the background , though , moves were being made to commit the Australians and New Zealanders elsewhere . Later in November , Winston Churchill , in his capacity as First Lord of the Admiralty , put forward his first plans for a naval attack on the Dardanelles . A plan for an attack and invasion of the Gallipoli peninsula was eventually approved by the British cabinet in January 1915 . It was decided that the Australian and New Zealand troops would take part in the operation , although they were outnumbered by the British , Indian and French contingents , a fact which is often overlooked today by many Australians and New Zealanders . The objective of the invasion was to open up another front against the Central Powers and to open the Black Sea 's only entrance to the Mediterranean , via the Dardanelles and Bosphorus , to allow shipping to Russia all year round . 
 After the failure of naval attacks , it was decided that ground forces were necessary to eliminate the Turkish mobile artillery and allow minesweepers to clear the waters for larger vessels . The British Secretary of State for War , Field Marshal Lord Kitchener , appointed General Sir Ian Hamilton to command the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force ( MEF ) that was to carry out the mission . The MEF consisted of Birdwood 's ANZAC , British 29th Division , British Royal Naval Division and the French Corps expéditionnaire d 'Orient . Some 40 @,@ 000 Russian troops would participate in the capture or occupation of Constantinople . 
 = = = Landing at Anzac Cove = = = 
 The invasion plan was for the 29th Division to land at Cape Helles on the tip of the peninsula and then advance upon the forts at Kilitbahir . The Anzacs were to land north of Gaba Tepe on the Aegean coast from where they could advance across the peninsula and prevent retreat from or reinforcement of Kilitbahir . The Anzac assault force , the 3rd Brigade of the Australian 1st Division , began to go ashore shortly before dawn at 4 : 30 am on 25 April 1915 . The intended landing zone was a broad front centred about a mile north of Gaba Tepe , however , possibly due to navigational error or an unexpected current , the landing went awry and the boats concentrated about a mile and a half further north than intended in a shallow , nameless cove between Ari Burnu to the north and Hell Spit to the south . Since 1985 , the cove has been officially known as Anzac Koyu ( Anzac Cove ) . 
 The Anzacs were confronted by a treacherous , confusing tangle of ravines and spurs that descended from the heights of the <unk> <unk> range to the sea . The landing was only lightly opposed by scattered Turkish units until Mustafa Kemal , commanding the 19th Division and perceiving the threat posed by the landings , rushed reinforcements to the area in what became a race for the high ground . The contest for the heights was decided on the second ridge line where the Anzacs and Turks fought over a knoll called Baby 700 . The position changed hands a number of times on the first day before the Turks , having the advantage of the higher ground on Battleship Hill , took final possession of it . Once the Anzac advance was checked , the Turks counter @-@ attacked , trying to force the invaders back to the shore , but failed to dislodge them from the foothold they had gained . A trench perimeter quickly developed and a bloody stalemate ensued until August . 
 = = = Krithia = = = 
 In May 1915 , Hamilton decided to concentrate his resources in the Helles sector . Birdwood withdrew Colonel McCay 's 2nd Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and they moved by sea to Cape Helles on 6 May . During the subsequent Second Battle of Krithia the two brigades suffered 1 @,@ 827 casualties , including McCay , in an ill @-@ advised daylight advance over open ground that could have been occupied after dark without loss . During May Turkish snipers were particularly active in Monash Valley . On 15 May , one shot and fatally wounded Major General Bridges . His body was returned to Australia and buried on the hill overlooking Royal Military College , Duntroon in Canberra . The Australian government sent Major General James Gordon Legge from Australia to replace him . 
 = = = Turkish counter @-@ attack = = = 
 On 19 May 1915 , the Turkish launched an assault against the Anzac perimeter . Forewarned by naval reconnaissance aircraft , the troops were on alert and the position was reinforced by the return of the 2nd and New Zealand Infantry Brigades from Cape Helles and the arrival of the 1st Light Horse Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade from Egypt . Along most of the line , the attack met with immediate disaster , with the Turkish attackers swept away by the rifle and machine gun fire of the Anzac defenders . At Courtney 's Post , one of the most exposed parts of the perimeter , the Turks managed to enter the trenches but there they encountered Lance Corporal Albert Jacka and others , who drove them out again . For his action , Jacka became the first Australian to win the Victoria Cross in the war . 
 = = = August offensive = = = 
 The repeated failure of the Allies to capture Krithia or make any progress on the Helles front led Hamilton to pursue an imaginative new plan for the campaign . On the night of 6 August a fresh landing of two infantry divisions was to be made at Suvla , 5 miles ( 8 km ) north of Anzac . Meanwhile , at Anzac a strong assault would be made on the Sari Bair range by breaking out through thinly defended sector at the north of the Anzac perimeter . The offensive was preceded on the evening of 6 August by diversionary assaults at Helles and Anzac . At Helles , the diversion at Krithia Vineyard became another futile battle with no gains and heavy casualties for both sides . At Anzac , an attack on the Turkish trenches at Lone Pine by the infantry brigades of the Australian 1st Division was a rare victory for the ANZACs . At a cost of over 2 @,@ 000 men , the Australians inflicted 7 @,@ 000 casualties on the Turks . Because it was an effective attack on a vital position , it was the most effective diversionary attack carried out by the Australians of the war , drawing in the Turkish reserves . 
 However , the main assault aimed at the peaks of Chunuk Bair and Hill 971 was less successful . The force striking for the nearer peak of Chunuk Bair comprised the New Zealand Infantry Brigade . It came within 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) of the peak by dawn on 7 August but was not able to seize the summit until the following morning . This delay had fatal consequences for another supporting attack on the morning of 7 August , that of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at the Nek which was to coincide with the New Zealanders attacking back down from Chunuk Bair against the rear of the Turkish defences . The New Zealanders held out on Chunuk Bair for two days before relief was provided by two New Army battalions from the Wiltshire and Loyal North Lancashire Regiments . A massive Turkish counter @-@ attack , led in person by Mustafa Kemal , swept these two battalions from the heights . Meanwhile , the landing at Suvla Bay was only lightly opposed but the British commander , Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Stopford , had so diluted his early objectives that little more than the beach was seized . Again the Turks were able to win the race for the high ground of the Anafarta Hills thereby rendering the Suvla front another case of static trench warfare . 
 The Suvla landing was reinforced by the arrival of the British 53rd and 54th Divisions along with the British 10th Division from Kitchener 's New Army divisions plus the dismounted yeomanry of the 2nd Mounted Division . The unfortunate 29th Division was also shifted from Helles to Suvla for one more push . The final British attempt to resuscitate the offensive came on 21 August with attacks at Scimitar Hill and Hill 60 . Control of these hills would have united the Anzac and Suvla fronts , but neither battle achieved success . When fighting at Hill 60 ceased on 29 August , the battle for the Sari Bair heights , and indeed the battle for the peninsula , was effectively over . 
 = = = Evacuation = = = 
 After eight months of bloody fighting it was decided to evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula . Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing . At Anzac , the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches , whereupon the Anzacs would open fire . As the numbers in the trenches were thinned , rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger . In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign , the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915 , without a single casualty . 
 Ultimately the Gallipoli campaign was a disastrous failure . It did not achieve any of the objectives that had been given as a justification for it , and due to the inexperience of high commanders and mismanagement there were an unacceptably high number of casualties amongst the participating troops , not only from as a result of combat , but also due to widespread disease that resulted from poor sanitation and hygiene in the front lines and a breakdown in the casualty clearance and resupply and logistics systems . It has been estimated that over the course of the campaign there were 26 @,@ 111 Australian casualties with 8 @,@ 141 killed . Other Allied casualties — killed and wounded — included : 7 @,@ 571 New Zealanders , 120 @,@ 000 British and 27 @,@ 000 French . 
 After the war , the bad conditions and high casualties amongst the Anzac troops resulted in a reasonably prevalent view in Australia that these had been due to the incompetence of British officers commanding the Australian troops and their disregard for the casualties that resulted from poorly planned or ill @-@ conceived attacks . Whether these claims are valid or not , there can be little doubt that the entire campaign was poorly conducted , and as a result there were many military lessons learnt that were to be applied in later campaigns . Despite this , for Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign has come to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity . Today , the date of the initial landings , 25 April , is a public holiday known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations , and indeed in Turkey , to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs , and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war .

 = = = Reorganisation in Egypt = = = 
 After the Gallipoli Campaign , Australian troops returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion , which involved the raising of another three infantry divisions — the 3rd , 4th and 5th — and the establishment of the Anzac Mounted Division . In March 1916 , the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units stayed in the area and fought Turkish troops and the Senussi Arab tribes that were threatening British control of Egypt . Mounted troops were particularly important in the defence of Egypt and Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the campaign , first seeing combat in the Battle of Romani . Apart from the horsemen , the mounted troops included the 1st Imperial Camel Corps Brigade . This was organised as a mounted infantry brigade . Of its four battalions , the 1st and 3rd were composed of Australians , the 2nd was British , and the 4th was half Australian and half New Zealand . The <unk> participated in most of the fighting in Egypt and Palestine until the brigade was disbanded in July 1918 . The Australian and New Zealand components then traded their camels for horses and became the 5th Light Horse Brigade . 
 = = = Fighting the Senussi Arabs = = = 
 In response to the growing threat from a pro @-@ Turkish Islamic Arab sect known as the Senussi , a composite British force — the " Western Frontier Force " — under the command of the British Indian Army officer Major General Alexander Wallace , was sent into the Libyan Desert to Mersa Matruh in late @-@ November 1915 . This force included a composite regiment of Australian light horse and the horse transport of the 1st Division . A series of sharp battles against the Arabs ensued at Um <unk> , Gebel <unk> and <unk> during December and January . British casualties were comparatively light , although many were killed or wounded , including Australians . Arab losses were much higher however , with hundreds killed during the fighting . Meanwhile , a number of the Australian Light Horse units returning from Gallipoli were sent further south to guard the edge of the Nile Valley against the Senussi . The 1st Armoured Car Section was also involved in guarding the Western Desert until it was sent to Palestine as the 1st Light Car Patrol at the end of 1916 . 
 = = = Battle of Romani = = = 
 The Battle of Romani took place near the Egyptian town of Romani , 23 miles ( 37 km ) east of the Suez Canal , on 3 – 5 August 1916 . The goal of the Turkish and German army was to control or destroy the Suez Canal , thereby denying the use of the waterway to the Allies and in doing so aiding the Central Powers . Both the Anzac Mounted Division , under Major General Harry Chauvel , and the 52nd ( Lowland ) Infantry Division saw action against the German and Turkish force . 
 Since first making contact with the advancing German and Turkish force on 20 July they had been harassed alternately by the Australian 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades . During the night of 3 – 4 August , the day before the battle commenced , both brigades were involved in fighting . By about midday on 4 August , the Turkish and German force had pushed the two Australian brigades back to a point where the 52nd ( Lowland ) Infantry Division , in their trenches , were able to attack the Turkish right flank , and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and British 5th Mounted Brigade arrived from their deployment protecting the Suez Canal , to extend the Australians ' line on the left flank . The Turkish and German advance was stopped by the fire brought to bear on them by the combined British infantry and Australian , British and New Zealand mounted forces and the deep sand , the midday summer heat , and thirst . 
 In these extremely tough conditions , the British infantry were unable to move effectively against the retreating German and Turkish force in the following days . Alone , the Anzac Mounted Division was unable to stop the retreating force withdrawing to Katia and eventually back to their base at Bir el Abd . This base was abandoned the day after it was attacked by the Anzac Mounted Division , on 12 August 1916 , ending any threat to the Suez Canal for the remainder of the war . The battle cost the Allies 1 @,@ 202 casualties of which 222 were killed , 71 died of wounds and 909 were wounded ; half of these were Australians . 
 = = = Battle of Magdhaba = = = 
 Following the victory at Romani the Anzac Mounted Division pushed the German and Turkish Army back across the Sinai Peninsula . The German and Turkish forces had been put on the defensive and retreated from Bir el Abd on 12 August 1916 towards the Egyptian – Turkish frontier , the day after being attacked by the Anzac Mounted Division . A Turkish rearguard action was fought at Bir el Mazar before the German and Turkish force retired to El Arish in September . In the Maghara Hills in October 1916 a strongly defended position was attacked by an Allied force based on the Suez Canal . Both Bir el Mazar and Maghara Hills positions were subsequently abandoned . During November , an aerial bombing raid by 5 <unk> and a Martinsyde , the largest air attack yet organised in the East was carried out on Beersheba . By the beginning of December the railway had reached Bir el Mazar and with the development of lines of communications , garrisons , support and services , it became possible to plan for an advance to El Arish . 
 On 21 December , after a night march of 30 miles ( 48 km ) the Anzac Mounted Division , commanded by Chauvel , entered El Arish , which had been abandoned by the German and Turkish force who had retreated to <unk> where the mounted force won a fierce daylong engagement against strong well constructed defences manned by determined defenders . Situated on the British right flank , the Egyptian outpost of Magdhaba was some 23 miles ( 37 km ) to the south @-@ south @-@ east into the Sinai desert , from El Arish on the Mediterranean coast . With Turkish forces on the defensive , <unk> , along with another position at Rafa , were the last main obstacles standing in the way of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force 's advance into Palestine . Chauvel , with the agreement of Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode commanding the Desert Column who had arrived earlier that day , set out to attack the Turkish forces at Magdhaba with the Anzac Mounted Division . Leaving at about midnight on 22 December , the Anzac Mounted Division was in a position by 03 @.@ 50 am on 23 December to see enemy fires still some miles away at Magdhaba . 
 With the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve , Chauvel sent the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade to move on Magdhaba by the north and north @-@ east to cut off the possibility of retreat while the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade followed the telegraph line straight to Magdhaba . The 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced mounted to the attack but fierce shrapnel fire forced them to advance up the wadi bed . By midday all three brigades and the Camel Brigade , despite support from machine @-@ guns and artillery , were hotly engaged . Aerial reconnaissance from Australian and British aircraft , which scouted out the Turkish positions , greatly assisted the attack , although the Turkish positions were obscured by the effect of a mirage and dust clouds . 
 When the fighting began the going was tough and by 1 @.@ 00 pm , after hearing that the Turkish defenders still had possession of most of the water in the area , Chauvel decided to call off the attack . However , the message reached the commander of the 1st Light Horse Brigade just as the Australians were preparing to assault the main redoubt , and the message was deliberately misplaced until the attacked had commenced . Both the 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigades made progress capturing about 100 prisoners and by 3 @.@ 30 pm the Turkish defenders began to surrender . By 4 @.@ 30 pm , the entire Turkish garrison had surrendered , having suffered heavy casualties , and the town was captured . The victory cost the Australians 22 dead and 121 wounded . 
 = = = Battle of Rafa = = = 
 Two and a half weeks later , on the evening of 8 January 1917 the mounted units of the Desert Column commanded by Chetwode rode out of El Arish towards Rafa where a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Turkish garrison was based . The attacking force comprised the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade , 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade of the Anzac Mounted Division under the command of Chauvel , the 5th Mounted Brigade and three battalions of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade . After a long night march , the Egyptian Expeditionary Force attacked the strongly entrenched position at El <unk> . A fierce day @-@ long battle resulted in the mounted troops ( fighting dismounted ) capturing the town around nightfall with the loss of 71 killed and 415 wounded . The Turkish garrison suffered heavily , with 200 killed and another 1 @,@ 600 taken prisoner . 
 = = = Fighting around Gaza , 1917 = = = 
 In early 1917 , the Imperial Mounted Division was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and two British mounted brigades . The division first saw service during the First Battle of Gaza , which occurred in southern Gaza on 26 March 1917 . At around noon two mounted brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Gaza from the north and east . At 6 @.@ 00 pm the Turkish position had become perilous with the ring closing tightly around Gaza . However , in a decision that dismayed most of their soldiers the British commanders decided to call off the attack and retreat , delivering victory to the Turks . A second attempt was made to capture Gaza on 19 April by which time the Turkish defences were even more formidable and the task confronting the British even more difficult . This battle became known as the Second Battle of Gaza . The Anzac Mounted Division played only a minor role in this battle suffering only 105 casualties out of the 5 @,@ 917 suffered . The second battle of Gaza was a disastrous defeat for the Allied forces . 
 In June 1917 , the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed as the Australian Mounted Division . In August 1917 Chauvel was placed in command of the Desert Mounted Corps , which included the two Australian mounted divisions , as well as the British Yeomanry Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade . Chauvel became the first Australian to command a corps , as well as the first to achieve the rank of lieutenant general . 
 With the failure of the Second Battle of Gaza a third assault was launched on Gaza between 31 October and 7 November 1917 . Units from the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division took part in the battle . The battle was a complete success for the Allies . The Gaza – Beersheba line was completely overrun and 12 @,@ 000 Turkish soldiers were captured or surrendered . The critical moment of the battle was the capture of the town of Beersheba on the first day by Australian light horsemen . The Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade , under Brigadier General William Grant , charged more than 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) at the Turkish trenches , overran them and captured the wells at Beersheba . In the capture of Beersheba , the Australians lost 31 men killed . A further 32 were wounded , while 80 horses were lost . On the Turkish side , more than 500 men were killed and 1 @,@ 500 captured as well as nine artillery pieces and a number of machine guns and other pieces of equipment . 
 = = = Fighting advance = = = 
 From 1 to 7 November , strong Turkish rearguards at Tel el Khuweilfe in the southern Judean Hills , at Hareira and Sheria on the maritime plain and at Sausage Ridge and Gaza close to the Mediterranean coast , held the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in heavy fighting . During this time the Turkish Army was able to withdraw in good order . The rearguard garrisons themselves were also able to retire under cover of darkness , during the night of 6 / 7 or 7 / 8 November . On 7 and 8 November , the surviving units of the 7th and 8th Turkish armies further delayed the advance of Desert Mounted Corps commanded by Chauvel and the XXI Corps 's 52nd ( Lowland ) Division and the 75th Yeomanry Division . 
 All other units of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force had come to the end of their lines of communication . These units were the XXI Corps ' 54th ( East Anglian ) Division resting at Gaza and the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade at Beit Hanun . Also in the rear was the whole of Chetwode 's XX Corps which had transferred its transport to XXI Corps . Its 53rd ( Welsh ) Division and corps cavalry , together with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade , were deployed in the front line near Tel el Khuweilfe , in the Judean Hills north of Beersheba . While its 60th ( London ) Infantry Division was resting at Huj , its 10th ( Irish ) Division and 74th Infantry Division were both resting back at Karm . 
 The Desert Mounted Corps and the two infantry divisions of XX Corps became involved in a series of engagements during the days leading up to the battle and on the day after . These began on 10 November when one brigade of the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division and two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division commanded by Major General Edward Chaytor successfully pushed across the Nahr Sukereir to establish a bridgehead on the Turkish right flank . Three brigades of the Australian Mounted Division under the command of Major General Henry West Hodgson ran into the Turkish rearguard 's left flank around the village of Summeil . The mounted troops occupied the village on 11 November but were unable to advance further due to intense Turkish artillery fire which continued throughout the day . 
 On 12 November Allenby made preparations for battle the following day . He ordered an attack by the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division to extend their position across the Nahr Sukereir on the Turkish Army 's right flank . Reinforced with two additional brigades , he ordered the Australian Mounted Division to advance towards Tel es Safi where they encountered a determined and substantial Turkish counterattack . This counterattack forced the mounted division to concede the territory gained during the day , before fighting the Turkish Army to a standstill in front of Summeil . On the morning after the battle at Mughar Ridge , Junction Station was occupied and during the following days other villages in the area were found to have been abandoned . Later in the morning of 14 November New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade ran into a determined and well entrenched Turkish rearguard near Ayun Kara , which they attacked . Fierce close quarter fighting against the Turkish 3rd Infantry Division continued during the afternoon . Although severely threatened , the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade eventually prevailed and went on to occupy Jaffa two days later . 
 The Battle of Mughar Ridge was fought on 13 November by the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division and the 75th Division in the centre , with the Australian Mounted Division on their right flank and the Anzac Mounted Division and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions on the infantry 's left flank . The battle was divided into two stages with a pause for artillery to be brought forward . Following the Yeomanry 's successful charge up onto El Mughar ridge , two crucial fortified villages were captured by elements of the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division . This victory resulted in the subsequent occupation of Junction Station , a vital railway station on the Turk 's lines of communication between Jaffa and Jerusalem . 
 = = = Jerusalem = = = 
 The Australian mounted troops took part the Capture of Jerusalem in late 1917 . These operations included two battles fought in the Judean Hills ; the Battle of Nebi <unk> from 17 to 24 November and the Defence of Jerusalem from 26 to 30 December and another fought on the maritime plain ; the subsidiary Battle of Jaffa on 21 – 22 December 1917 . This series of battles involved the British Empire 's XX Corps , XXI Corps and the Desert Mounted Corps fighting the Turkish 7th Army in the Judean Hills and the 8th Army north of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast . 
 After the failure of widespread and determined Turkish counterattacks fought from 27 November to 1 December by the 7th Turkish Army they evacuated Jerusalem . Troops from the Australian Mounted Division were the first mounted troops to enter Jerusalem in December 1917 . Towards the end of December the British Empire forces at the Battle of Jaffa and the Defence of Jerusalem succeeded in pushing the Turkish armies north . A strong British defensive line was established which remained in place until mid September 1918 . The line stretched across from well north of the Nahr el Auja on the Mediterranean coast in the west to north and east of Jerusalem . It was extended during the middle of February 1918 when Jericho in the Jordan Valley was captured and the eastern end of the line was secured on the Dead Sea . 
 = = = Transjordan operations = = = 
 In March and April 1918 , Australian and New Zealand mounted troops and British infantry took part in two raids east across the Jordan River to Amman and Es Salt , a village in Palestine 23 kilometres ( 14 mi ) west of Amman . Although these raids were unsuccessful , they encouraged Turkish commanders to believe that the main British effort would be launched across the Jordan when it would be launched along the coastal plain . Before these operations could commence it was necessary to capture the country east of Jerusalem and into the Jordan Valley to Jericho . The attack on the Turkish 26th and 53rd Infantry Divisions was made by the 60th ( London ) and the Anzac Mounted Divisions on 19 February . Talat ed Dumm , on the road from Jerusalem , was captured the next day and in the evening the Wady Fara and Nebi Musa were also captured . On 21 February Jericho was occupied by the two divisions of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force . 
 = = = Final offensive = = = 
 During the final offensive in September 1918 , the two divisions of Australian mounted troops , as well as the 1st Light Car Patrol and No. 1 Squadron AFC , took part in Battle of Megiddo on 28 September 1918 , a decisive British victory in which 70 @,@ 000 Turkish soldiers were taken prisoner . The Desert Mounted Corps attacked across the Golan Heights , cutting off the north and north @-@ west exits to Damascus on 29 September . On 30 September , the head of a column of 20 @,@ 000 Turkish and German troops was annihilated by the Australian light horsemen as it attempted to withdraw west through the Barada Gorge . Australian troops were the first to enter Damascus , which fell on 1 October . Following an advance of 300 kilometres ( 190 mi ) , Aleppo was captured on 25 October . The Turkish government signed an armistice on 28 October 1918 and surrendered outright two days later . 
 Following the armistice , the Australian Mounted Division went into camp at Tripoli while the Anzac Mounted Division , having borne the brunt of the entire campaign , suffered heavily from malaria and influenza in the Jordan Valley . Australia 's role in the Sinai and Palestine campaign was later acknowledged by Field Marshal Edmund Allenby , who had been commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Allied forces in the Middle East , as having been considerable . Total Australian battle casualties in the campaign were 4 @,@ 851 , including 1 @,@ 374 dead . 
 = = Western Front = = 
 = = = Transfer to Europe = = = 
 In March 1916 , the infantry units of the AIF were transferred from Egypt to Europe for service on the Western Front . Initially they were organised into I Anzac Corps and II Anzac Corps alongside the New Zealand Division . The 2nd Division was the first to arrive in France , followed by the 1st Division , while the 4th and 5th left Egypt later in June 1916 . The 3rd Division was the last to arrive , having been formed in Australia in March 1916 , and moving to England for training in July 1916 , before being sent to France in December 1916 . For the next two and a half years the constant rotations in and out of the line were punctuated by a number of major battles , during which the Australians earned for themselves a formidable reputation . On 1 November 1917 the Australian divisions were re @-@ grouped together to form the Australian Corps . 
 When the 1st Division arrived , it was reunited with its mechanical transport . In September 1914 , the Army had decided to supply mechanical transport for the 1st Division and formed a company in New South Wales and one in Victoria . These were the first ever mechanical transport units in the Australian Army . Nearly 200 vehicles were purchased and the two units departed Melbourne for Egypt on 22 December 1914 . Unfortunately , vehicles over 5 long tons ( 5 @.@ 1 t ) were prohibited in Cairo as most bridges could not hold their weight , whereas they possessed vehicles weighing up to 7 long tons ( 7 @.@ 1 t ) . It was therefore arranged for them to continue to England where they arrived on 15 February 1915 . There they lived in tents on Salisbury Plain and hauled gravel for roads before being sent to France in July 1915 . 
 They were not the first Australians to serve on the Western Front . An Australian Voluntary Hospital had been formed in England in August 1914 from Australian expatriates . All medical practitioners in the unit were Australians and although women were not allowed to serve as doctors , Australian nurses were accepted . The unit left for France in August 1914 and from October was based at Wimereux , where the 2nd General Hospital joined it in June 1916 . In July 1916 , the Australian Voluntary Hospital was absorbed into the British Army . Another group of Australians had also arrived in France before I Anzac Corps . In June 1915 , the 1st Siege Artillery Brigade was formed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Adams Coxen , the Australian Army 's Director of Artillery , for service on the Western Front . About half the men in the unit were permanent gunners of the Garrison Artillery . The brigade departed Melbourne for England on 17 July 1915 and landed in France on 27 February 1916 . Its 54th Siege Battery was equipped with 8 inch howitzers and its 55th Siege Battery with 9 @.@ 2 inch howitzers . 
 With the move of the majority of the AIF to France , the base organisation was transferred to the United Kingdom . Most of the training units moved to the Salisbury Plain , establishing depots at <unk> Down , <unk> , Larkhill and Tidworth . When it arrived , the 3rd Division also moved into camps in this area . Command Depots , where men returning from hospitals were sent before being returned to their units , were established at <unk> Down , Weymouth , Wool , Dorset and <unk> . Depots for men moving from the United Kingdom to France were established at Étaples . In June 1917 , these were swapped with the Canadians for depots around Le Havre , thereby reducing travelling time from the Salisbury Plain . AIF Headquarters was established at <unk> Road in London and Colonel R. M. <unk> . Anderson , a businessman , was appointed as its commandant . Anderson negotiated a new method of payment for services provided by the British Army as a per capita per diem payment . 
 = = = Battle of the Somme , 1916 = = = 
 On 7 April 1916 , I Anzac Corps took up positions in a quiet sector south of Armentières , known as the " Nursery " . The Australians were spared from participating in the disastrous first day on the Somme , nevertheless within three weeks of the beginning of the Allied offensive , four divisions of the AIF had been committed to the battle . Only the 3rd Division did not take part , having only just recently arrived in England from Australia . The 5th Division , positioned on the left flank of the salient , was the first to see action during the Battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916 , suffering a staggering 5 @,@ 533 casualties in a single day . 
 The 1st Division entered the line on 23 July 1916 , taking part in the assault on Pozières . Initially they succeeded in carrying the German positions with relatively small losses , however , once the Germans had recovered they directed an intense artillery barrage upon the town which resulted in heavy losses . By the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July , they had suffered 5 @,@ 286 casualties . Two days after taking over the line , the 2nd Division was thrown into a hastily planned attack that resulted in further casualties when the Germans spotted the Australians forming up and once again subjected them to the weight of their artillery and machine guns . Another attack was launched on 4 August which , although it met with success , resulted again in such heavy casualties — almost 7 @,@ 000 — that the division was relieved the next day . 
 Following the attack on Pozières the Australians were called upon to attack Mouquet Farm in August . All three divisions of I Anzac Corps were committed in an effort to force a breach in the German lines behind Thiepval , to the north of Pozières . The task of the initial advance fell to the 4th Division on 10 August , which had already suffered 1 @,@ 000 casualties resisting the final German counter @-@ attack , but in the ensuing battle it would lose a further three times that number as the Australians once again suffered at the hands of the German artillery , finding themselves squeezed into a frontage of less than 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) against which the Germans were able to concentrate the weight of their defence . Three more attacks were made over the course of the next three weeks as the Australians fought their way across the shell @-@ pocked countryside to the farm , only to be forced out again shortly after by the concentration of German artillery . The other two divisions of I Anzac fared only slightly better in these attacks and at the end of the engagement , Australian casualties at Mouquet Farm totalled 6 @,@ 300 men . 
 As that battle on the Somme dragged on , the Canadian Corps was brought up and the AIF was withdrawn from the line to re @-@ organise and reform , having suffered almost 23 @,@ 000 casualties over the course of the 45 days that they had been involved . The 5th Division had been so badly mauled , having been incapacitated by the losses they had suffered at Fromelles , that it was not until October that the 5th Division finally returned to the line and joined the 1st , 2nd and 4th Divisions on the Somme near Flers . 
 = = = Battle of Bullecourt = = = 
 In March 1917 two ' flying columns ' from the 2nd and 5th Divisions pursued the German back to the Hindenburg Line , capturing the town of Bapaume . On 11 April , the 4th Division , consisting of the 4th and 12th Brigades , assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the First Battle of Bullecourt . The battle was a disaster , with over 3 @,@ 000 casualties and 1 @,@ 170 taken prisoner by the Germans . On 15 April the 1st and 2nd Divisions were struck by a German counterattack at dawn near the town of Lagnicourt , by a force of up to 23 battalions as the Germans attempted to take advantage of the weakness that had developed in the Allied line following the British offensive at Arras . The Australians were initially forced to abandon the town to the Germans and in the process several artillery batteries were lost , however , at 7 : 00 am a successful counterattack was launched by four Australian battalions , resulting in the town being recaptured and the guns reclaimed . Later , on 3 May two brigades of the 2nd Division — the 5th and the 6th — took part in the Second Battle of Bullecourt , where they succeeded in taking sections of the Hindenburg Line and eventually managed to hold most these gains until they were relieved by the 1st Division . On 7 May the 5th Division was committed to relieve the 1st , remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid May . While the battle resulted in a victory for the Allies , the effort cost the AIF some 7 @,@ 482 casualties and ultimately ended plans to expand the AIF to a sixth division . 
 = = = Battle of Messines = = = 
 On 7 June 1917 , along with two British corps , the II Anzac Corps , consisting of the Australian 3rd Division , the British 25th Division and the New Zealand Division , with the Australian 4th Division attached , launched an operation in the Flanders region of southern Belgium , near Messines The objective was to eliminate a salient that had developed in the line south of Ypres , enclosing the Wytschaete – Messines ridge and thus providing the Germans with good observation and fields of fire that could threaten the major offensive that the British planned to launch around Ypres later in the year . The attack commenced with the detonation of 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 pounds ( 450 @,@ 000 kg ) of explosives that had been placed underneath the Messines ridge in 19 separate tunnels , completely destroying the German trenches . 
 Following the explosions , the Allied advance was virtually unopposed as the Germans were too stunned and demoralised to put up much resistance . However , not everything went the Australians ' way . The 3rd Division , under Major General John Monash , suffered heavy casualties when they were shelled by phosgene gas and shrapnel shells while moving towards the line of departure , nevertheless the division still managed to get into position for the start of the attack . Strong German counterattacks were launched the next day , once again supported by concentrated artillery fire ; however , the advance was able to continue on through the mess of concrete blockhouses the Germans had erected and continued on until all the objectives had been taken . Australian casualties amounted to nearly 6 @,@ 800 men . On 2 July 1917 , Major General Holmes was mortally wounded by a German shellburst while surveying the Messines battlefield with the Premier of New South Wales , William Holman .

 Between September and November 1917 , I Anzac Corps took part in a number of actions around Ypres in Belgium as the Allies launched a campaign in order to capture the Gheluvelt Plateau in Belgium . Collectively these actions have come to be known as the Third Battle of Ypres , of which they were a part , although to Australians they are more commonly known by the names of the places where the individual actions took place — Menin Road , Polygon Wood , Broodseinde , Poelcappelle and Passchendaele . 
 I Anzac Corps was committed six weeks after the start of the battle and on 16 September , having marched through Ypres the night before , the 1st and 2nd Divisions took up a position in the trenches on the main ridge at Glencorse Wood . The first attack came on 20 September at Menin Road , where the Australians experienced success making considerable gains against the enemy for the loss of about 5 @,@ 000 casualties . On 26 September , the 4th and 5th Divisions attacked and captured Polygon Wood , while later on 4 October , another successful attack was made on the main ridge at Broodseinde , where the four Australian divisions involved fought side by side , as they clashed head on with a German counterattack that had been launched at the same time the Australians had risen to carry out their assault . The result was a rout by the Australians , as the German line broke and following further attacks against German pillboxes , the ridge was captured . 
 The first two attacks had been successful and as Allied commanders began to believe that a breakthrough was possible further attacks were made at Poelcappelle on 9 October and at Passchendaele on 12 October despite heavy rain that turned the ground into a muddy quagmire . Both attacks were ultimately doomed to failure , with heavy casualties , as the attacks foundered in the mud and as the battle petered out , it was decided that it was time for the Australians to be withdrawn from the line . This was completed by 14 November 1917 . Over the course of the eight weeks they had been involved in the fighting around Ypres , they had suffered 38 @,@ 000 casualties . 
 = = = German Spring Offensive , 1918 = = = 
 On 21 March 1918 , having been buoyed by the capitulation of Tsarist Russia , the German Army launched their Spring Offensive against the Allies with a staggering 63 divisions over a front of 70 miles ( 110 km ) . As the Allies began to fall back against the tremendous weight of this offensive , on 25 March the Australian 3rd and 4th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens from where they had been holding the line at Messines . The German offensive lasted with varying intensity for the next five months and during this time , all five divisions of the AIF in France were involved in the fighting as they attempted to stem the tide of the German advance , which achieved large territorial gains and at one stage looked like it might ultimately secure a remarkable victory for the Germans as they pushed to within 50 miles ( 80 km ) from Paris late in May . During this time , the Australians were involved in a number of actions at Dernacourt , Morlancourt , Villers @-@ Bretonneux , Hangard Wood , Hazebrouck , and Hamel . 
 Of these actions , the last one , at Hamel on 4 July 1918 , is perhaps the most notable . Even though the action was relatively minor in terms of the scale of previous operations mounted on the Western Front , it is notable because it was the first ' set @-@ piece ' operation planned and carried out by the newly appointed commander of the Australian Corps , Lieutenant General John Monash and it has since been used as the model of how to successfully carry out a combined arms attack . Using aircraft , artillery and armour in effective combination with infantry , the attack was over in the space of 93 minutes ; although Monash had planned for a 90 @-@ minute operation . It achieved its objectives of straightening the Allied line and taking the town of Hamel . The Australians had advanced the line almost 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) across a front of 6 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 0 mi ) and in the process taken roughly 1 @,@ 600 German prisoners as well as over 200 machine guns , trench mortars and anti @-@ tank weapons . Against this the Australians suffered 1 @,@ 062 casualties . 
 = = = Hundred Days Offensive = = = 
 The last @-@ ditched effort by the Germans to win the war came to a grinding halt in mid @-@ July and after that there followed a brief period of lull , during which time the Australians undertook a series of small unit actions aimed at capturing parts of the German line with limited support . These actions became known as Peaceful Penetrations and were essentially a cross between trench raids and patrolling . Their success relied heavily upon the leadership and initiative of junior commanders and the ability of soldiers to employ principles of fire and manouevre . This lull did not last long , however , as the Allies were soon ready to launch their own offensive , known as the Hundred Days Offensive , which would ultimately bring about an end to the war . 
 The offensive began on 8 August 1918 when 20 Allied divisions , including four Australian , struck at Amiens on the Somme . Using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel , the Allies achieved territorial gains that had been unheard of since the start of the war . In the Australian sector , the 4th and 5th Divisions had initially spearheaded the advance , before the 2nd and 3rd Divisions had advanced another three kilometres to secure the secondary objectives . The attack had been so successful that it was later described by German General Erich Ludendorff as a " black day " for the German Army . 
 Following that the Allied offensive continued for the next four months , right up until the end of the war . During the Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at Lihons , Etinehem , Proyart , Chuignes , and Mont St Quentin , before taking part in their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at Montbrehain . Australian casualties during these battles were very high and coupled with the drying up of reinforcements from Australia , the rejection of the proposal to introduce conscription and the granting of home leave to men who been serving since 1914 meant that by the end of the war the AIF was severely stretched to the limit . Consequently , during the height of the offensive it was decided to disband three battalions — the 36th , 47th and 52nd — in order to reinforce other units . 
 The engagement at Montbrehain was the Australian Corps ' last contribution to the war and they were out of the line training when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 . Total Australian casualties on the Western Front numbered 181 @,@ 000 , including 46 @,@ 000 of whom died . Another 114 @,@ 000 men were wounded , 16 @,@ 000 gassed , and approximately 3 @,@ 850 were taken prisoners of war .

 When the war ended , there were 92 @,@ 000 Australian soldiers in France , 60 @,@ 000 in England and 17 @,@ 000 in Egypt , Palestine and Syria . Small numbers were serving in other theatres . Australian troops from the 1st Australian Wireless Signal Squadron provided communications for British forces during the Mesopotamian Campaign . They participated in a number of battles , including the Battle of Baghdad in March 1917 and the Battle of Ramadi in September that year . Meanwhile , following the Russian Revolution in 1917 , the Caucasus Front collapsed , leaving Central Asia open to the Turkish Army . A special force , known as Dunsterforce after its commander , Major General Lionel Dunsterville , was formed from hand @-@ picked British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces . Some 20 Australian officers served with Dunsterforce in the Caucasus Campaign and one party under Captain Stanley Savige was instrumental in protecting thousands of Assyrian refugees . Australian nurses also staffed four British hospitals in Salonika , and another 10 in India . 
 = = Australian Flying Corps = = 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 The Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) was formed in March 1914 and it was soon deployed to German New Guinea , with one BE2c aircraft and crew dispatched with the AN & MEF , although the colonies surrendered before the plane was even unpacked . The first operational flights did not occur until 27 May 1915 , when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist the Indian Army in protecting British oil interests in what is now Iraq . The Corps later saw action in Egypt , Palestine and on the Western Front throughout the remainder of the war . Organised into four operational squadrons in France and the Middle East and another four training squadrons in England , the AFC remained part of the AIF . 
 = = = Mesopotamian Half Flight = = = 
 The Mesopotamian Half @-@ Flight — also known as the Australian Half @-@ Flight — was the first AFC unit to see active service . On 8 February 1915 , the Australian Government had received a request for air assistance from the Viceroy of India for assistance fighting the Turks . The AFC was still forming and could provide enough aircrew and ground staff for only half a flight : the unit therefore became known as the Mesopotamian Half @-@ Flight and Captain Henry Petre was appointed commander . The AFC contingent sailed for Bombay , and on 20 April 1915 it left for Basra , arriving at the end of May . Flying underpowered and unreliable aircraft such as the Caudron , Maurice Farman Longhorn and Martinsyde , the Half @-@ Flight suffered a high attrition rate , losing two killed and six captured out of its strength of just nine pilots . The arrival of reinforcements allowed the formation of a squadron , ( No. 30 Squadron RFC ) , however by November 1915 only one of the original pilots remained . The squadron was mainly involved in unarmed reconnaissance , although later small 9 pounds ( 4 @.@ 1 kg ) bombs were added to the aircraft . In October , three Australian aircraft bombed an Arab tribe known to be hostile in an unsuccessful attempt to bring them to surrender . During the Siege of Kut the last Australian pilot in Mesopotamia , Captain Petre , dropped supplies to the garrison . When Kut surrendered , the AFC ground crewmen located in the city were captured , seven of them later dying in captivity . Petre flew the only remaining Shorthorn to Egypt on 7 December 1915 , where he rendezvoused with No.1 Squadron AFC , effectively marking the end of the Half @-@ Flight 's service . 
 = = = Operations in the Middle East = = = 
 By late 1915 the AFC began forming complete squadrons . At British request No. 1 Squadron was dispatched to Egypt with 28 officers and 195 other ranks , where they were equipped with British aircraft including BE2c and Martinsyde <unk> . The squadron operated from Heliopolis , Palestine and Syria over the next two years , supporting ground forces in all the major battles of the Palestine campaign against the Turks . Missions included aerial reconnaissance , bombing enemy positions , communications and artillery spotting . They were also involved in many air @-@ to @-@ air battles with German aircraft , while it was in this theatre that the Australians first encountered anti @-@ aircraft fire . The squadron was re @-@ equipped in 1917 with <unk> , <unk> and Martinsyde <unk> aircraft , while by 1918 these types were replaced with Bristol F.2 Fighters . Notably during this time Lieutenant Frank McNamara was awarded the Victoria Cross for rescuing another Australian pilot who had been shot down by ground fire and forced to land close to Turkish positions on 20 March 1917 . No. 1 Squadron also took part in the actions at Wadi Fara on 21 September 1918 as part of the Battle of Megiddo , which witnessed the destruction of the bulk of the Turkish Seventh Army by British airpower . 
 = = = Fighting on the Western Front = = = 
 Additional AFC squadrons began forming in Australia for service on the Western Front , with No. 2 , 3 and 4 Squadrons arriving in France between August and December 1917 . No. 2 Squadron , equipped with <unk> , was subsequently involved in the Battle of Cambrai on 20 November 1917 , conducting patrol duties , ground strafing and bombing enemy troops and positions . Casualties were high with 7 of the squadrons 18 aircraft shot down , and 2 pilots lost . No. 3 Squadron , equipped with <unk> , was supporting the final phase of the Battle of Passchendaele in Flanders , conducting mainly artillery spotting duties . No. 4 Squadron , equipped with Sopwith Camels , was the last to arrive in France , and was assigned to the First Army around Lens . Notably during March 1918 the squadron was engaged in aerial combat with aircraft commanded by Manfred von Richthofen — known as the ' Red Baron ' — shooting down two German aircraft for the loss of one of their own . The Lens sector had been relatively quiet until 21 March 1918 when the Germans launched a major offensive , with No. 4 Squadron heavily engaged in low @-@ level bombing to support the 4th Australian Division . 
 The Australian squadrons played a limited role in the allied advance from Amiens on 8 August 1918 , with No. 3 Squadron engaged in reconnaissance and contact patrols to help identify the locations of forward troops . They also undertook extensive aerial photography to aid in remapping and the locating of German artillery positions . During this period Nos. 2 and 4 Squadrons were in the Ypres – Arras area and were involved in patrols and raids on the railways in the vicinity of Lille . With the Germans in retreat during September 1918 , the squadrons felt considerable pressure just keeping up . Regardless , No. 4 Squadron took part in , perhaps its most spectacular action , in the very last weeks of the war . On 29 October , 15 Australian Sopwith Snipes encountered more than 60 German Fokkers , in an action which became one of the largest air battles of the war . The Australians gained the upper hand and 10 Fokkers were shot down for the loss of one Snipe , and the damage of several others . 
 During their time on the Western Front , No. 2 and No 4 . Squadrons had been used mainly in the fighter role , while No. 3 Squadron was primarily used for reconnaissance . No. 4 Squadron became the most successful fighter squadron in France , accounting for 199 enemy aircraft , while No. 2 Squadron was credited with the destruction of 185 . The total AFC casualties on the Western Front included 78 killed , 68 wounded and 33 taken prisoner . Following the end of the war on 11 November 1918 , No. 4 Squadron was the only Australian unit assigned to the British Army of Occupation , arriving in Germany in December and being based in Cologne . The three AFC squadrons subsequently handed over their equipment to the RAF in February 1919 and returned to Australia where they disbanded . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Despite Australian military aviation being in its infancy , the AFC 's identity as a separate national force was considered important , not to mention unusual . Thousands of aircrew from the other Dominions — such as New Zealand and Canada — flew with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service , and their unified successor force after 1 April 1918 , the Royal Air Force during the war , without gaining the benefits of command and the administrative experience which came with an independent air service . By the end of the war , four squadrons had seen active service , 460 officers and 2 @,@ 234 other ranks had served in the AFC , and another 200 men had served as aircrew in the British flying services . Casualties included 175 dead , 111 wounded , 6 gassed and 40 captured . The AFC was subsequently disbanded after the war in 1919 being replaced by the Australian Air Corps , which became the Royal Australian Air Force in 1921 . 
 = = Royal Australian Navy operations = = 
 At the outbreak of war the Royal Australian Navy consisted of the battlecruiser HMAS Australia , the light cruisers Sydney , Melbourne and Brisbane ( under construction ) , the destroyers Parramatta , Yarra and Warrego , and the submarines AE1 and AE2 . Three more destroyers were also under construction . The Squadron was under the command of Rear Admiral Sir George E. Patey , a British admiral who was knighted on the deck of the Australia before it departed England in 1913 . 
 The first naval operation of the war was in support of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force during the occupation of German New Guinea . The naval portion of the force included the Australia , Melbourne , Sydney , Warrego , Encounter , and submarine AE1 . The only loss during the New Guinea Campaign occurred when the AE1 disappeared on 14 September 1914 , taking three officers and 32 men with it . 
 The first major RAN victory of the war occurred when the cruiser , HMAS Sydney sank the German light cruiser , SMS Emden off the Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean on 9 November 1914 . Four Australians were killed in the engagement and another 12 were wounded . Ships of the RAN helped provide naval cover for the ambitious landings at Gallipoli , and the submarine AE2 broke the blockade of the Dardanelles to harass Turkish shipping but was later sunk and her crew captured in the Sea of Marmara . 
 In 1915 the light cruisers Melbourne and Sydney were deployed to the Atlantic where they worked alongside the Royal Navy 's North American and West Indies Squadrons , which were engaged in surveillance operations on the large number of German ships that had taken refuge in neutral American ports when the war had broken out . This continued until September 1916 when both cruisers were moved to the North Sea where they joined Australia , which had been assisting the Royal Navy in its blockade of the German High Seas Fleet . 
 During this time the RAN also continued to carry out operations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans . By 1915 there were up to 74 German ships which had taken refuge in ports in the Netherlands East Indies . The presence of these ships close to Australia and the sea lanes that connected the nation to the United Kingdom and the Middle East was a cause of concern to the Navy and so in the middle of 1915 the cruiser HMAS Psyche and the sloop Fantome were sent to the Bay of Bengal to conduct patrol operations . Later in the year , in October , a force of three destroyers , a yacht and the cruiser Encounter were sent into the <unk> Strait to search for a German munitions base that had been reported in the area . Nothing was found , although the patrol served to interrupt German efforts to carry out subversive activities in a number of British possessions . 
 In May 1917 the British government requested assistance from the Australian government in dealing with the increasing threat posed by German U @-@ boats . Six destroyers — the Warrego , Parramatta , Yarra , Swan , Torrens and Huon — were sent in response to this request , and undertook anti @-@ submarine operations in the Adriatic , working out of Brindisi , Italy as part of the Otranto Barrage . 
 The most decorated RAN unit of the war was the Bridging Train . A reserve unit commanded by Lieutenant Commander Leighton Bracegirdle , it supported the British at Suvla Bay during the Gallipoli Campaign by constructing piers and harbours in the bay . Afterwards it served in Egypt and Palestine , taking part in an amphibious assault in El Arish and the First Battle of Gaza before it was disbanded in 1917 . A number of members later went on to serve with the AIF and RAN . During the war the RAN lost 171 men killed , including 15 officers and 156 sailors , of which six officers and 57 sailors had been on loan from the Royal Navy . 
 = = Home front = = 
 = = = Australian Military Forces on home service = = = 
 Although the main focus of Australia 's military during World War I was overseas in Europe and the Middle East , there was still a necessity to maintain troops in Australia on home service to carry out a number of essential tasks . As the AIF was otherwise engaged these duties out of necessity fell to the soldiers of the militia and a small number of regular soldiers . 
 In the early stages of mobilisation a number of militia infantry battalions were called out to carry out guard duties upon infrastructure that was considered important to the war effort , such as munitions factories , communications facilities , ammunition dumps and transportation centres . 500 men from the Kennedy Regiment were sent to Thursday Island from Townsville to garrison the island in response to a possible threat from German forces in the Pacific . Additionally , militia troops were used to establish and guard internment camps and garrison artillery and engineer units from the militia were also mobilised to assist the regular units that were manning coastal defences . 
 By the end of 1914 the naval situation in the Pacific had eased to a large extent due to the sinking of the Emden , and it was decided that there was no longer a need to maintain guards on many of the less important facilities , and instead it was decided to concentrate the home defence network upon maintaining the coastal defences and on guarding ships while they were in port . Nevertheless , in the larger seaports these precautions required the commitment of considerable resources , requiring several hundred men to provide security . The requirement for the militia to undertake these duties was eased , however , when a special corps was raised from men that had been rejected for service with the AIF , to which a corps of garrison military police that had served in the AIF was added later . 
 The militia garrison artillery and engineers were required throughout the war , however , to man the coastal defences . Despite the fact that after 1915 it was decided that only small garrisons were required on active service , the militia was ordered to maintain their readiness in case they were required to be called out and such was the importance placed upon their role that to a large extent they were barred from joining the AIF for overseas service . In February 1916 a large @-@ scale effort by militia artillerymen to enlist in the artillery units that were being raised for the 3rd Division was prevented when they were called out to man the coastal defences due to the threat posed by a German commerce raider that was believed to be in the Pacific . This mobilisation lasted until April 1916 , when the garrisons were again reduced and the ban on men serving in militia artillery and engineer units volunteering for overseas service was lifted . 
 In April 1918 the militia artillery was again mobilised , although this time only for a month , when news that the German commerce raiders Wolf and Seeadler had entered Australian waters the previous year . In June 1918 the number of troops actively employed on home service was 9 @,@ 215 , of which 2 @,@ 476 were regulars . At this time the Navy took over the task of providing guards for ships in harbour and communications facilities , thus allowing for many of the militia troops to be released for further training , and as such it was decided to increase the period of camp training for the militia from eight days to 24 . 
 = = = Conscription = = = 
 Throughout World War I the Australian forces deployed overseas were all volunteers , however , on the home front there was considerable debate about the issue of conscription . Conscription had been a contentious issue ever since Federation and when the AIF was initially raised in 1914 it had been decided that it would be an all @-@ volunteer force due to the provisions of the Defence Act that precluded sending conscripts overseas . Nevertheless , as the war progressed , casualties amongst the deployed forces began to reach alarming rates and as the flow of reinforcements and recruits for the AIF began to drop in 1916 , the issue of conscription rose once more . 
 In Australia , however , public opinion about the matter was divided with many Australians opposed to the issue on moral grounds , feeling that the situation was not desperate enough to require such a drastic measure , while others felt it necessary in order to achieve final victory . The Hughes Labor government decided to hold a plebiscite on the matter and on 28 October 1916 the matter was decided by a narrow margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent , with the no vote prevailing . Despite the result , the issue split the Labor Party and the pro @-@ conscription prime minister , Billy Hughes , ultimately left the party and joined with members of the opposition that supported conscription to form a new party , known as the Nationalist Party . 
 As manpower shortages on the Western Front began to become acute , a second plebiscite was held on 20 December 1917 . This time it was defeated by an even greater margin of 94 @,@ 152 votes . This effectively put an end to plans to expand the AIF in France and ultimately led to severe manpower shortages that the AIF in France experienced in 1917 and 1918 . As a result , plans to expand the force to a 6th Division were shelved and its manpower distributed amongst the other five divisions , while the five divisions were amalgamated together under the banner of the Australian Corps , thus effectively allowing the 4th Division , which was struggling to maintain its numbers to act as a depot formation within the Corps with the other three divisions providing most of the combat power . 
 As the war continued , the manpower shortages continued . Wounded men were being pressed back into service , and there were cases of " combat refusal " by the 1st and 59th Battalions . On 23 September 1918 , Monash ordered the breakup of some under @-@ strength battalions to reinforce others . In the AIF the battalion was the source of pride and identification for the men , rather than the regiment as in the British Army , so in some cases this order was defied – some men , who were not eligible to draw rations as their unit no longer officially existed , lived by stealing food or sharing with other units . Monash rescinded the order for a while but eventually " the Heads " ( as Australians called their senior officers ) enforced the change by marching off companies by night into different battalions . The change ultimately proved unnecessary as the war ended shortly after . 
 = = = Internment , censorship and other special measures = = = 
 The global nature of the war meant that many functions that were previously vested in the individual Australian state governments had to be placed under the control of the Commonwealth government . Additionally , the exigencies of the war meant that the government required the power to enact certain laws that under the Constitution it would not normally be able to do . In order to enable this to occur , the War Precautions Act 1914 was introduced in October 1914 , providing the Commonwealth government with wide ranging powers for a period of up to six months after the duration of the war . 
 The main provisions of the Act were focused upon allowing the Commonwealth to enact legislation that was required for the smooth prosecution of the war . The main areas in which legislation was enacted under the War Precautions Act were : the prevention of trade with hostile nations , the creation of loans to raise money for the war effort , the introduction of a national taxation scheme , the fixing of the prices of certain goods , the internment of people considered a danger to the war effort , the compulsory purchase of strategic goods , and the censorship of the media . 
 At the outbreak of the war there were about 35 @,@ 000 people who had been born in either Germany or Austria @-@ Hungary living in Australia . Due to large @-@ scale German migration in the late 19th century , there were also an inestimable number of people of German origin , many of whom maintained an affinity for their ancestral roots . Many of these were naturalised Australians , and indeed it is believed that many men of German origin enlisted in the AIF . However , due to concerns about the loyalties of some members of the German and Austrian communities , internment camps were set up where those suspected of unpatriotic acts were sent . In total it is believed that 4 @,@ 500 people were interned under the provisions of the War Precautions Act , of which 700 were naturalised Australians and 70 Australian @-@ born . Following the end of the war , 6 @,@ 150 were deported . 
 There was a considerable public backlash to the way in which some of the provisions of the War Precautions Act were applied , particularly in relation to certain sections of the community such as trade unions and other sections of the community that were for various reasons not as sympathetic to the British cause as the wider community . Indeed , in 1917 , following the suppression of a prominent trade union and the jailing of 12 of its members on charges of sedition and sabotage , it seemed as if Australia 's war effort might have been in danger of breaking down . 
 After the war , the continued operation of the War Precautions Act led to considerable social and political unrest in late 1918 and into 1919 and a number of violent incidents broke out . The most notable of these was the so @-@ called Red Flag Riots in Brisbane , in 1919 . 
 = = = Economy = = = 
 At the outset of the war , Australia 's economy had been quite small and dependent largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings , while most manufactured products were imported from overseas . Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment , indeed it was estimated that after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war , that up to 15 @,@ 000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce . 
 These initial concerns , however , were short lived , at least in the beginning as the British government provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue . Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties . To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers for their products , at least initially , however , in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods , thus alleviating Australian concerns about a significant reduction in the standard of living . This understanding proved particularly beneficial for the wool and wheat industries , where the British government undertook to buy Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them . 
 On the whole Australian commerce was expanded due to the war , although the cost of the war was quite considerable and the Australian government had to borrow considerably from overseas to fund the war effort . In terms of value , Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent , while the number of Australians employed in the manufacturing industry increased over 11 per cent . This was due in the most part to the reduced ability of traditional sources to continue supplying Australia with manufactured products , which out of necessity stimulated the development of the Australian manufacturing industry . 
 In terms of goods produced indigenously , it was estimated that due to the inability of traditional suppliers to deliver manufactured goods because of trade embargoes and shipping shortages up to 400 new articles were produced in Australian factories as a result of the war . This was not an insignificant number , although the transformation of the Australian economy as a result of World War I was by no means as significant as that which occurred during World War II . The expansion of the steel industry that occurred during this time laid the foundation for future industrialisation . 
 Despite this increase in the domestic manufacturing industry there was still a significant shortfall in many items . In part this was due to the priority that military consumption and production necessarily had over civilian , however , there was also a considerable scarcity of raw materials and other components required for manufacturing . This was due both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom , as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements . The result of this was inflationary . Domestic prices went up , while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide . As a result , the cost of living for many average Australians was increased considerably . 
 An increase in the trade union movement was an inevitable corollary of this and during the war years there was a considerable increase in the membership of the various unions . Despite the considerable rises in the costs of many basic items , the government sought to maintain wages largely as they were . Although the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8 – 12 per cent , it was not enough to keep up with inflation and as a result there was considerable discontent amongst workers , to the extent that industrial action followed . Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors , and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition to the issue of conscription , which many trade unionists were opposed to . Nevertheless , the result was very disruptive and it has been estimated that between 1914 and 1918 there were 1 @,@ 945 industrial disputes , resulting in 8 @,@ 533 @,@ 061 working days lost and £ 4 @,@ 785 @,@ 607 in lost wages . 
 Overall , the war had a significantly negative impact on the Australia economy . Real aggregate Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) declined by 9 @.@ 5 per cent over the period 1914 to 1920 , while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 per cent decline in civilian employment . Meanwhile , although population growth continued during the war years , it was only half that of the prewar rate . Per capita incomes also declined sharply , falling by 16 per cent .

 = = = Repatriation and demobilisation = = = 
 Following the end of hostilities in Europe the Australian government decided against contributing Australian forces to the occupation forces that were sent to Germany as part of the post war settlement so that it could begin the repatriation of the AIF early . Lieutenant General Sir John Monash was appointed Director @-@ General of Repatriation and Demobilisation and oversaw the process in Britain , while Lieutenant General Henry Chauvel took charge of the efforts in the Middle East . 
 Rather than employing a system that returned men by units , or by employment categories , it was decided to utilise an egalitarian system that saw men who had been away for the longest period of time being returned first . Due to the size of the forces deployed overseas — roughly 167 , 000 personnel in France , Britain and Egypt — and the logistical requirements of bringing them home the process was nevertheless a lengthy one and as such it became important to occupy the troops while they waited . In order to achieve this and to prepare the men for a return to civilian employment , a vocational education scheme was set up by George Long and troops in Britain were offered educational courses and civilian work placement opportunities and although these programs were not as successful as hoped , several thousand soldiers took advantage of them . 
 Some Australians decided to delay their departure and instead joined the British Army and went on to serve in Northern Russia during the Russian Civil War , although officially the Australian government refused to contribute forces to the campaign . HMAS Yarra , Torrens , Swan and Parramatta served in the Black Sea during the same conflict . Elsewhere , in Egypt in early 1919 , a number of Australian light horse units were used to quell a nationalist uprising while they were waiting for passage back to Australia . Despite shortages in shipping , the process of returning the soldiers to Australia was completed faster than expected and by September 1919 there were 10 @,@ 000 men still left in Britain waiting for repatriation . The last of the main transports conveying Australian troops left England on 23 December 1919 , arriving in Australia in early 1920 . A year later , on 1 April 1921 , the AIF was officially disbanded . 
 The process of repatriation did not end there , though . Upon their return to Australia the effort shifted towards placing the returned soldiers into employment , or education and taking care of those that were too badly injured to work . In order to meet these needs the Commonwealth established the Repatriation Department , tasked with managing the placement of returned soldiers into employment , training , education , housing . Eventually this also included the colossal task of managing the provision of war pensions , managing repatriation hospitals and convalescent homes and administering the Soldier Settlement Scheme . The total cost of these provisions was considerable , and in June 1935 it was estimated to have cost approximately £ 238 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 which was more than the total amount spent on defence during the war . 
 In order to advocate for the many thousands of returned servicemen and women many ex @-@ services organisations sprang up . The most prominent of these was probably the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia which had been established in 1916 by representatives from many state @-@ based organisations already in existence . Following the war this organisation grew in its political influence as its numbers grew and was very active in the repatriation process , advocating for financial entitlements for veterans and securing concessions for soldiers returning to civilian employment . By 1919 it was estimated to have 150 @,@ 000 members although this fell dramatically in the mid @-@ 1920s . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 The war affected Australia in many ways , although arguably not as greatly as it did the many European nations that were more directly involved . Economically the war had a number of significant impacts , although the Great Depression would later prove far more significant and Australian industry was not as greatly transformed as it would be following World War II . The political landscape was also transformed due to the rifts that resulted from the issue of conscription , while to a smaller extent the role of women in society also evolved as more women entered the workforce . Indeed , between 1914 and 1918 there had been a 13 per cent increase in the employment of women ; however , this was mainly in areas were women were traditionally employed . Equally , although around 2 @,@ 000 women were employed as nurses in the AIF , there was no great involvement of women in the military during the war . 
 Another legacy was the manner in which it led to the emergence — albeit only fleetingly — of an independence in Australian foreign affairs . Although previously Australian foreign interests had been largely handled by Britain , as a combatant Australia sent its own delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 , while it also began to take a more assertive role in regional affairs in the Pacific . At the peace conference Prime Minister Hughes pushed aggressively for reparations and an Australian mandate over German New Guinea ; a stance which conflicted with the liberal internationalist inspired Fourteen Points put forward by American President Woodrow Wilson . Regardless , following the war there was little real change in Imperial relations and Dominion affairs , and as a result the war arguably did not lead to any significant change in Australia 's perception of its role in the world . Indeed , profound change would only occur following the Japanese crisis of 1942 , which ultimately saw Australia pursue a foreign policy more independent of Britain , and an alliance with the United States . 
 Perhaps the greatest effect of the war was a psychological one . The heavy losses deeply affected many directly , and war memorials were built all over the country as people sought to remember those that had been killed . However , despite the size of Australia 's contribution to the fighting , there were many Australians who had had no actual experience of it . Realising this , and having witnessed the impact of the war first hand , Charles Bean , who was instrumental in editing and writing the official history of Australia 's involvement in the war , advocated the need for a national memorial and was one of the main architects in establishing the Australian War Memorial in Canberra . The experience of the war also perpetuated many notions about the Australian character and national identity that endure to this day . For many Australians the performance of their soldiers — particularly during the failed Gallipoli campaign — served to highlight the nation 's emergence as a member of the international community , while bringing to the fore a belief in Australians ' natural ability as soldiers . The attitudes of many Australians towards war itself were also greatly affected . There was a widespread revulsion at the large @-@ scale destruction and loss of life that had occurred and a desire that it should never occur again . In many regards this led to a general complacency towards defence and military matters after the war and arguably led to the nation 's lack of preparedness for the next major conflict , while it may still be evident in Australian strategic behaviour to this day .

 = Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary = 
 Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary is a first @-@ person shooter video game set in the Halo universe and is an enhanced remake of Halo : Combat Evolved . Microsoft announced the game alongside Halo 4 at the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo . The game was released on November 15 , 2011 — the 10th anniversary of the original title 's launch — for the Xbox 360 game console , and rereleased as part of Halo : The Master Chief Collection for the Xbox One on November 11 , 2014 . 
 Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary was developed as a partnership between development studios 343 Industries , Saber Interactive , and Certain Affinity . 343 Industries , the Halo series ' franchise overseers , approached Saber Interactive to develop a remake of the original Halo in time for its tenth anniversary . After considering whether to remake the game entirely or to adapt and add features to the existing PC version , Saber decided to use its game engine for reproducing the original 's appearance and the original Halo 's engine for gameplay . A development tool for toggling between the old and new visuals became a game feature . Anniversary 's enhancements include a complete high @-@ definition visual overhaul , support for cooperative and multiplayer gameplay via the Xbox Live online service , new and remastered sound effects and music , and extras such as achievements and hidden in @-@ game collectibles . The game is the first in the series to include Kinect support . 
 Critical reception to Anniversary was generally positive . The updated graphics , sounds , and ability to toggle between the remastered and original visuals were praised . Complaints included technical glitches , faults with the original game 's level design , and the multiplayer mode 's implementation . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary and the original , Halo : Combat Evolved , are identical in gameplay and plot . The game is a first @-@ person shooter with portions of vehicular combat taking place from a third @-@ person perspective . The plot follows the player character and protagonist Master Chief , a supersoldier , as he fights the alien Covenant on the mysterious ancient ringworld Halo . Players are equipped with a recharging energy shield that absorbs damage ; players also have health that can only be replenished by health packs scattered across the game 's levels . A variety of human and alien weapons and vehicles can be used . 
 Players can switch between the " classic " graphics of the original game and new graphics developed for the remake by pressing the Back button on the controller . The classic and new graphics are presented in high @-@ definition , 16 : 9 widescreen compared to the original game 's 480i resolution and 4 : 3 aspect ratio . The remastered graphics are also available in stereoscopic 3D for compatible televisions . 
 Additions to the gameplay include Xbox Live achievements , online cooperative gameplay , and hidden content : video terminals that provide additional plot information , and collectible skulls that modify gameplay when activated . Support for Xbox Kinect includes voice commands for video navigation , in @-@ combat directives , and environment @-@ scanning , which adds on @-@ screen items to an encyclopedia called the Library . 
 The original Combat Evolved did not support online multiplayer , but players could play multiplayer locally via split @-@ screen or System Link LAN . Anniversary adds revamped multiplayer and two @-@ player co @-@ op campaign support available both online via Xbox Live and offline locally . The game 's multiplayer mode uses Halo : Reach 's engine and features seven remakes of Combat Evolved and Halo 2 maps . Anniversary also includes a new map based on Halo 's eponymous campaign level for Firefight , a wave @-@ based survival multiplayer game type in which players and their allies fight enemy groups of scaling difficulty . Anniversary introduced artificially intelligent Firefight allies to the series . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After fleeing the Covenant 's destruction of the human world Reach , the human ship Pillar of Autumn makes a random slipspace jump to avoid leading the Covenant to Earth . Arriving in uncharted space , the crew of the Autumn discover a massive ringworld orbiting a gas giant . When the Covenant attack , Autumn 's captain , Jacob Keyes , entrusts the ship 's AI , Cortana — and her knowledge of defense deployments and the location of Earth — to the supersoldier Master Chief for safekeeping . Master Chief fights off Covenant boarding parties and leaves the Autumn via a lifeboat to the surface of the ringworld while Keyes lands the Autumn on the ring . 
 On the ringworld , the Chief rallies human survivors and leads a boarding party to rescue Keyes from the Covenant 's clutches . Keyes reveals that the Covenant call the ring " Halo " , and they believe it is some sort of weapon . The Chief is tasked with finding Halo 's control room before the Covenant does . Once Cortana is inserted into the control room , she becomes alarmed and stays behind while she sends Master Chief to find Keyes . While searching for the captain , Master Chief encounters the Flood , a parasitic organism that infects sentient life . The release prompts Halo 's caretaker , the AI 343 Guilty Spark , to enlist the Chief 's help in activating Halo 's defenses . The Chief 's activation of the ring from the Control Room is stopped by Cortana , who reveals that Halo 's defenses do not kill Flood , but rather their food in an effort to starve them — meaning that activating the ring would wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy . To stop the Flood from spreading and Spark from activating the ring , Cortana devises a plan to detonate the crashed Autumn 's engines and destroy Halo . Fighting through Flood , Covenant , and Guilty Spark 's robotic Sentinels , the Chief manually destabilizes the Autumn 's reactors and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter .

 After Microsoft acquired Bungie in 2000 , Bungie developed the original Halo : Combat Evolved as a 2001 launch title for the Xbox . Bungie and Microsoft split in 2007 , but the rights to Halo remained with the latter , which formed an internal division to oversee Halo franchise development . 343 Industries , the internal division , approached Saber Interactive with a proposal to remake Combat Evolved for the game 's tenth anniversary . Saber 's Chief Operating Officer Andrey Iones recalled that the offer was " an opportunity we [ could not ] miss " , as Saber had never before worked on a major game franchise and many team members were fans of Halo . Saber developed concept art to form visual ideas for the remake and then flew to Seattle , Washington , to meet with 343 Industries . 
 343 Industries wanted a complete remake of the original game by the tenth anniversary of Halo 's release , giving Saber just over a year to complete the project . The gameplay was to remain unchanged ; while the original game had imbalanced elements , 343 Industries decided to preserve the game experience players remembered while introducing young fans to the game for perhaps the first time . The visuals , meanwhile , would be updated along with added features like campaign skulls . Iones recalled that experimentation with the game was limited — redoing <unk> character animations was off @-@ limits because redoing them could introduce gameplay bugs , and design choices like game balance had already been determined . Likewise , porting the PC version of the game back to the Xbox to add features would have constrained the amount of visual improvements Saber could make , as well as require significant time training artists to use the same production pipelines that were used for Combat Evolved . Saber decided to use the original engine for the gameplay and its own for the visuals , despite the compatibility problems this solution presented . Development began under the codename Spark . The game was completed and released to manufacturing ( " going gold " ) on October 15 , 2011 . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 To solve the issues of transferring information from the original game 's engine to the Saber engine , the developers looked at how they used the third @-@ party Havok physics engine to handle object positioning , velocities , and collisions . Saber created a proxy of every object in the Halo engine to transfer into the Saber engine , meaning that the game 's original programming remained unchanged . The game 's ability to alternate between the legacy and remastered graphics engines in the campaign was made possible by the rendering engine developed by Saber Interactive . The technology allowed the developers to update Halo : Combat Evolved 's visuals and preserve the original gameplay . Originally , players would have chosen which graphical presentation to play from the main menu . The in @-@ game toggle feature quickly became a talking point among the developers , who pushed for it to be available to other players . Since the ability to switch between classic version and remastered version was provided to players , both engines work simultaneously to retain the spontaneity of game . This approach caused several problems , including collision issues — because objects and environments in the original game were of a lower resolution with fewer polygons , higher @-@ resolution visuals in the Saber engine could deviate from the original significantly . As the original game 's geometry was used as the basis for collisions , in some cases characters could appear to walk through or above terrain , weapons could drop through the ground , and bullets would appear to be deflected by nothing . The sheer number of these issues , combined with the desire to keep the original gameplay intact , forced Saber to use a variety of approaches to fix the problems , including making tools for artists to visualize height differences and creating intermediate geometry . In some cases , the artists developed other ways of keeping to the same collision data while updating the visuals by changing the actual object — turning a blocky , low @-@ polygon rock into an angular Forerunner structure avoided the collision issues . 
 Where possible , the developers drew on or adapted assets from Halo 3 and Reach . For elements that had no analogues , Microsoft sent art director Ben Cammarano to Saber 's offices in St. Petersburg to oversee the redesign of the game 's visuals . Cammarano established four tenets of Halo — what Iones termed " heroic vistas , iconic imagery and characters , clean and vibrant aesthetics , and visceral action " — to guide Saber 's artists . Since the original assets already existed , concept artists took screenshots from the original game and painted over new looks to show how environmental effects , improved lighting , and new textures could change the look of the levels . Some of Saber 's visual designs were considered too much of a departure from the original game — while the artists had changed the position of the Halo ringworld and nearby planets to make a more pleasing skybox , Microsoft insisted maintaining continuity with the universe was more important and vetoed the changes . Vocal fans pointed out other inconsistencies with the game 's visuals in prerelease trailers and pictures that Saber ultimately changed . Iones pointed to the floor designs of the Forerunner structures , the assault rifle , and the look of the Chief as places fans had an impact . The Chief 's armor was redesigned from scratch instead of porting existing assets . 
 Saber doubted that it would be able to convert Combat Evolved 's split @-@ screen cooperative play to facilitate online play . Greg Hermann , a 343 Industries technical lead who had experience with Bungie technology , assisted Saber in development of a networking solution that would allow online co @-@ op . Since the original game would behave identically when given the same scenario and inputs , only the player inputs needed to be synchronized between players ' Xbox consoles . 
 Because of its previous contributions to the series — Halo 2 's <unk> and Halo : Reach 's Defiant map pack — Certain Affinity was approached by 343 Industries to streamline the multiplayer maps to take Halo : Reach 's gameplay options into account . The multiplayer is powered by the Halo : Reach engine . 343 Industries director Frank O 'Connor said that the decision to use Reach for the multiplayer was controversial , even within the studio . " In Halo 's day , there was never a proper networking mode , " O 'Connor explained . " We couldn 't roll back the technology ; [ recreating Halo 's local area network multiplayer ] just wouldn 't have worked with things like latency and all other modern Xbox Live @-@ related problems . So we would have had to build it from scratch , and it still wouldn 't have been the experience [ players ] remember . " An additional consideration O 'Connor mentioned was that producing a full replication of Combat Evolved 's multiplayer would have divided the Halo player base and interrupted Reach 's lifespan . In choosing which seven Halo maps to remake , 343 Industries set a number of rules — the map could not have been previously remade for a 360 @-@ era Halo title , it had to work with Reach 's gameplay sandbox , and it had to be a fan favorite . The company retained the same art director between the campaign and multiplayer elements of Anniversary to make sure the two halves of the game looked visually cohesive . 
 Since 343 Industries developed Halo 4 concurrently with the anniversary edition , it decided to use Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary to link the original trilogy with the upcoming Reclaimer trilogy by means of in @-@ game collectibles similar to Halo 3 's terminals , Halo 3 : ODST 's audio logs , and Halo : Reach 's data pads . While the other games ' collectibles were aimed at and enjoyed by serious Halo fiction fans , 343 Industries wanted to make Anniversary 's terminals higher @-@ budget , more impressive , and accessible to all players . 
 Though Iones described Anniversary 's one @-@ year development cycle as a " very smooth ride " , some production issues that were not discovered until late in development contributed to bugs and other problems . Saber relied on a partially automated tool to render the game 's cinematics , but did not do a thorough vetting of the results until after the game had reached the alpha stage of its release cycle . As a result , the developers realized that their addition of motion capture animation and lip @-@ syncing had caused serious audio syncing issues and animation bugs . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 The developers refreshed Combat Evolved 's music and sound effects along with its visuals . While players can toggle the original music from Halo : Combat Evolved , the soundtrack was also rerecorded in partnership with <unk> Studios , using the 75 @-@ piece Skywalker Symphony Orchestra and the Chanticleer vocal ensemble . Because there were no MIDI recordings of the original game 's music , Paul Lipson , Lennie Moore , Tom Salta , and Brian <unk> transcribed each piece of music . 
 The soundtrack was released digitally and in two physical formats : a two @-@ disc CD edition and a vinyl record edition , the latter of which was limited to 2000 units . The vinyl edition contains 16 tracks on two sides and comes with a code to download the rest of the Anniversary soundtrack digitally . The compact disc edition contains thirty @-@ nine tracks and was released on November 15 , 2011 .

 Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary was announced to the public with a trailer on June 6 , 2011 , at Microsoft 's annual E3 global media briefing , which closed with the teaser trailer for Halo 4 . Bonuses for <unk> the game included a Master Chief Xbox 360 avatar costume and an exclusive Grunt Funeral skull , which toggles whether enemy Grunts explode upon death . During the Halo Universe panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic @-@ Con , a short trailer showcasing the animation used in the terminals with a narration by 343 Guilty Spark was shown to the fans . Microsoft launched the Halo Living Monument , consisting of a live @-@ action short and a website , to celebrate the launch of Combat Evolved Anniversary . 
 Thirteen retail Microsoft Stores hosted launch events for Anniversary 's November 15 , 2011 , midnight release ; festivities included sixteen @-@ player multiplayer matches , limited @-@ edition giveaways , and appearances by the game developers . In the United Kingdom , Microsoft and the British video game retailer GAME held two prerelease events with the full version of the game and prizes . In another British promotion , those who purchased a special Halo @-@ themed Pizza Hut pizza during a two @-@ week promotional period surrounding the release date received two days of Xbox Live premium membership . VideoGamer.com 's staff found the pizza to be delicious , but its connection to the Halo franchise tenuous .

 Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary received generally positive reviews . On aggregate review website Metacritic , the game has a weighted score of 82 out of 100 , based on 73 reviews from critics . On GameRankings , the game has an overall score of 81 @.@ 92 % based on reviews from 53 critics . The staff of Official Xbox Magazine praised the developers for preserving the original gameplay , avoiding " revisionist horrors " and Star Wars rerelease moments . Brandon Justice of Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote for fans of the series , " [ Anniversary ] is one of the best pieces of fan service our industry has ever produced , and you need to go buy it . " 
 Reviewers disagreed on how the core gameplay of Combat Evolved , unaltered in Anniversary , had aged over ten years . Writing for GameSpot , editor Chris Watters opined that " the fundamental mechanics of the game have ... endured well " , with responsive controls and challenging enemies . PALGN writer Adam <unk> agreed , praising " rock solid " controls and tight gameplay , while Mike Wilcox of The Sydney Morning Herald argued the anniversary edition " [ proves ] a game with a winning formula doesn 't wither with age " . IGN 's Steven Hopper felt that the level design was dated , the repetitious environments making it easy for players to lose their bearings , and that vehicles handled poorly . Giant Bomb 's Brad Shoemaker wrote that while the best aspects of the game remained , other aspects — such as the level design and fighting the Flood — were no less frustrating after ten years ; Digital Spy 's Matthew Reynolds echoed the sentiment , praising the game for presenting situations unsurpassed in later titles while faulting irregular checkpoints with increasing frustration . 
 The remastered visuals were positively received ; reviewers such as The Inquirer 's Chris Martin and The Escapist 's Russ Pitts singled out the graphics @-@ switch button for praise . The Guardian 's Steve Boxer called the feature " utterly fascinating — a bit like ... archaeology on your console " , and said that the visual overhaul improved areas where the original game engine was weak , such as rendering outdoor environments . While praising most of the game 's refinements , Watters singled out the Flood as enemies he thought the original game envisioned better , saying " the simplicity of the classic look feels more sinister and alien " . Hamza Aziz of Destructoid appreciated the visual updates , but not some of the resulting audio – animation syncing issues . 
 Critics had split opinions on Anniversary 's additional features . The stereoscopic 3D effect was alternatively praised and dismissed : Matt Miller of Game Informer wrote that the feature " doesn 't add anything to the experience " , while Aziz described the feature as " fantastic " , considering its use in Anniversary to be more subtle and pleasing than in other games . Aziz also applauded the narrative terminals , although he condemned the Kinect voice command support for being slower in combat than pressing buttons . Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica enjoyed the improvements of the Halo maps in Anniversary 's multiplayer mode , but criticized the inability to play said mode via four @-@ person local split screen as in the original game . Reynolds agreed with 343 Industries 's choice to use Reach for Anniversary 's multiplayer mode , writing that the map pack offered " a smart way of reintroducing players back into the game " , as well as commending Halo 's combat for offering an alternative to contemporary military shooters .

 The Simpsons family attends a monster truck rally featuring Truck @-@ o @-@ Saurus , a giant robotic dinosaur which ultimately crushes the Simpson family car . The rally 's grand finale features a death @-@ defying stunt by " the world 's greatest daredevil " , Lance Murdock . Despite the fact that the act leaves Murdock badly hurt and hospital @-@ bound , Bart is enamored by his performance and dreams of becoming a daredevil . Bart quickly injures himself during his first skateboard stunt by trying to jump over the family car . At the hospital , Dr. Hibbert shows Bart a ward full of children who have been hurt from attempting stunts . Nonetheless , Bart is persistent and continues to pursue his daredevil interest by jumping over a swimming pool and Homer on his hammock . On a class trip to Springfield Gorge , Bart announces that on Saturday , he will jump the gorge on his skateboard . Lisa talks Bart into visiting the hospital to see Murdock , hoping that the daredevil will talk him out of the dangerous stunt . Unexpectedly , however , Murdock encourages Bart to continue on his legacy . Bart plans to do it against the wishes of Homer , who insists that it is too dangerous . 
 Even after a punishment , several orders , and a " heart @-@ to @-@ heart talk " with Homer , Bart still goes to the gorge and tries to jump it . He is stopped at the last second by Homer , who decides to jump the gorge himself to show Bart what it is like to see a family member needlessly risk their life for no good reason . Bart , not wanting to see his father injured on his account , promises to never jump the gorge and never try to be a daredevil again . However , when Homer goes to hug Bart to make up their misunderstanding , the board rolls down a hill and flies over the gorge , with Homer on board . Although it briefly appears as though Homer will make it safely across , he loses momentum near the middle and plummets to the bottom , progressively becoming severely injured with each fall towards the jagged rocks , and receiving multiple fractures and wounds . A helicopter winches Homer out , slamming his head against the side of the gorge several times in the process before he is loaded into a waiting ambulance , which immediately crashes into a tree as it starts to leave for the hospital . The gurney carrying Homer rolls out of the back , and Homer once again falls to the floor of the canyon . Having arrived at the hospital he is put in the same ward next to Lance Murdock , where he tells him , " You think you 've got guts ? Try raising my kids ! "

 The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky and directed by Wes Archer . The character Lance Murdoch was based on Evel Knievel , an American motorcycle daredevil and entertainer famous in the United States and elsewhere between the late 1960s and early 1980s . Kogen , Wolodarsky , and many other members of the Simpsons ' staff were fans of Knievel 's stunts , and Wolodarsky named " Bart the Daredevil " as his favorite episode among the episodes that he wrote for The Simpsons , because it is " near and dear to [ his ] heart " . 
 Dr. Hibbert makes his first appearance on the series in the episode . In Kogen and Wolodarsky 's original script for " Bart the Daredevil " , Hibbert was a woman named Julia Hibbert , who they named after comedic actress Julia Sweeney ( Hibbert was her last name , through marriage , at the time ) . When the Fox network moved The Simpsons to prime time on Thursdays to compete against the National Broadcasting Company 's ( NBC ) top @-@ rated The Cosby Show , the writing staff instead decided to make Hibbert a parody of Bill Cosby 's character Dr. Cliff Huxtable . 
 The episode has been referenced in numerous clip shows and flashback episodes throughout the series . In particular , the scene of Homer plummeting down Springfield Gorge has become one of the most used The Simpsons clips . In the scene , Homer falls down the cliff on the skateboard , bouncing off the cliff walls and finally landing at the bottom , where the skateboard lands on his head . After being loaded into an ambulance at the top of the cliff , the ambulance crashes into a tree , and the gurney rolls out , causing Homer to fall down the cliff again . 
 In the season thirteen episode " The Blunder Years " , when the family is trying to find out why Homer cannot stop screaming after he is hypnotized , Homer flashes back to his greatest moment : jumping the Springfield Gorge , only to be interrupted by Lisa saying " Everyone 's sick of that memory , " referring to the fact that the scene has been referenced so many times . 
 The scene was first featured outside of " Bart the Daredevil " in the season four episode " So It 's Come to This : A Simpsons Clip Show " . When the clip is shown in that episode , additional footage is seen of Homer bouncing down the cliff the second time , and after he lands at the bottom , the gurney lands on his head . Contrary to popular belief , the second fall down the gorge ( ending with Homer getting hit by the gurney ) was not a deleted scene from " Bart the Daredevil " , but rather a scene animated exclusively for " So It 's Come to This : A Simpsons Clip Show " . 
 The scene is also referenced in the season fourteen episode " Treehouse of Horror XIII " , in which a large number of Homer 's clones created in the episode fall down the gorge . " Bart the Daredevil " was once again referenced in The Simpsons Movie when Bart and Homer jump over Springfield Gorge on a motorcycle , and when they land on the other side , the ambulance from this episode can be seen in the background ( still smashed against the tree ) .

 At the beginning of the episode , Lisa , Bart and Bart 's friends watch professional wrestling . The Russian wrestler in the ring , Rasputin , is named after mystic Grigori Rasputin . The monster truck at the rally , Truck @-@ o @-@ saurus , is a parody of the <unk> monster truck . In the hospital , Dr. Hibbert shows Bart a patient that tried to fly like Superman , and he also mentions the " three stooges " ward . Lance Murdoch is a parody of famous <unk> such as Evel Knievel and Matt Murdock , the alter ego of the Marvel Comics superhero Daredevil . Bart 's attempt to jump over Springfield Gorge is a reference to Knievel 's 1974 attempt to jump Snake River Canyon at Twin Falls , Idaho , with a <unk> X @-@ 2 . Bart appearing at Springfield Gorge in the distance is based on Omar Sharif 's entrance in Lawrence of Arabia .

 In its original American broadcast , " Bart the Daredevil " finished 20th in Nielsen ratings for the week of December 3 – 9 , 1990 , making The Simpsons the highest @-@ rated television series on the Fox television network that week . To promote The Simpsons Sing the Blues , the music video for the album 's lead single , " Do the Bartman " , premiered shortly after this episode 's first broadcast . In an interview conducted by Entertainment Weekly in 2000 celebrating the show 's tenth anniversary , Groening named " Bart the Daredevil " his favorite episode of the series , and chose the scene in which Homer is loaded into an ambulance and then falls out of it as the funniest moment in the series . 
 Since airing , the episode has received positive reviews from critics . Michael Moran of The Times ranked it as the third best in the show 's history . DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode , and referred to its opening by claiming that " any episode that starts with the brilliance that is <unk> has to be good . " He liked the decent morals explored in the episode , and called the conclusion a " great one " , making it a " consistently fine episode " . Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk considered " Bart the Daredevil " one of his favorite episodes of the season . He found the daredevil scenes to be funny , but also appreciated the episode 's scenes with " true heart " . Kleinman concluded by noting that the episode helps The Simpsons stand apart from other animated and live action sitcoms by focusing more on the relationships between the characters than " just a humorous weekly plotline " . Writing for the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky noted that " Bart the Daredevil " ' s sequence in which Homer falls down the gorge is the one that " everyone remembers " , noting that " he 's getting much stupider by this point . " In his book Doug Pratt 's DVD , DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor Doug Pratt chooses the episode as one of the funniest of the series .

During the race Villeneuve and Schumacher collided while battling for the lead and the resulting damage to Schumacher 's car forced him to retire . The blame for the incident was later attributed to Schumacher by the sport 's governing body , the FIA , and he was stripped of his second @-@ place finish in the championship . Schumacher 's tactics were widely criticised by the media , including publications based in his home country of Germany , and in Ferrari 's home country of Italy . 
 Following the race Williams and McLaren were accused of colluding to decide the finishing order . Villeneuve stated that " it was better to let them through and win the World Championship " . The FIA determined there was no evidence to support the claims , and dismissed the accusations .

 Originally scheduled as the Grand Prix of Portugal at the Estoril circuit , the race was moved to the Jerez circuit when Estoril 's management had financial difficulties . Jerez was chosen as the venue due to engine suppliers Renault stating their wish that the following Japanese Grand Prix would not be their last race . 
 Heading into the final race of the season , two drivers were still in contention for the World Drivers ' Championship . Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was leading with 78 points ; Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve was second with 77 points , one point behind Schumacher . Behind Schumacher and Villeneuve in the Drivers ' Championship , Heinz @-@ Harald Frentzen was third on 41 points in the other Williams , with Jean Alesi and David Coulthard on 36 and 30 points respectively . Villeneuve had won two more races than Schumacher during the season , meaning that in the event of a tie on points , the rules stated Villeneuve would be world champion . 
 Villeneuve had to finish the race in a points @-@ scoring position ( points were awarded for drivers finishing in sixth place or higher ) and ahead of Schumacher to become World Drivers ' Champion . Schumacher would be world champion if he finished ahead of Villeneuve , or if Villeneuve failed to score any points by finishing lower than sixth or not completing the race . 
 In the World Constructors ' Championship , Williams led with 118 points and Ferrari were second on 102 . Ferrari had only won five races during the season compared with Williams 's eight . Williams had therefore clinched the constructors ' title before the race , as even if Ferrari finished first and second in the race , thereby taking 16 points , and both Williams cars failed to score a point , they could not beat Williams . 
 Following the Japanese Grand Prix on 12 October , the teams conducted testing sessions at various locations around the world . Williams , Benetton , Sauber , Jordan and McLaren conducted at a test session at the Silverstone Circuit . Williams , Sauber and Jordan tested using 1998 @-@ spec cars , in preparation for the 1998 season . Arrows conducted testing at the Circuit de Nevers Magny @-@ Cours circuit , performing wet weather tyre development with tyre suppliers Bridgestone with the circuit flooded to simulate wet weather conditions . Prost conducted testing at Circuit de Catalunya and performed tyre testing for Bridgestone , as well as testing their 1998 @-@ spec car . Ferrari remained at the Suzuka circuit testing an electronic <unk> used by their driver Eddie Irvine at the previous race .

 Four practice sessions was held before the Sunday race — two on Friday from 11 : 00 to 12 : 00 and 13 : 00 to 14 : 00 CEST ( UTC + 2 ) , and two on Saturday morning held from 09 @.@ 00 to 09 @.@ 45 and from 10 @.@ 15 to 11 @.@ 00 CEST . In the first two practice sessions , Prost driver Olivier Panis set the fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 22 @.@ 735 seconds , one @-@ tenths of a second faster than Arrows driver Damon Hill . Villeneuve and Rubens Barrichello were third and fourth . Mika Häkkinen and Coulthard , set the fifth and eighth @-@ fastest times respectively for McLaren ; they were separated by Frentzen and Alesi . Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher completed the top ten . 
 In the final two practice sessions , Coulthard set the fastest lap with a time of 1 : 20 @.@ 738 ; Häkkinen finished with the second @-@ fastest time . The Williams drivers were quicker — Villeneuve in third and Frentzen in sixth . Panis slipped to fourth ahead of Gerhard Berger , their best times one @-@ tenth of a second apart . They were ahead of Stewart driver Jan Magnussen , Shinji Nakano for Prost , Hill and Alesi . 
 The qualifying session was held on Saturday afternoon and lasted one @-@ hour between 13 : 00 to 14 : 00 CEST , each driver was allowed up to twelve timed laps , with their fastest lap used to determine their grid position . Cars were timed using a TAG Heuer timing system , which measured to an accuracy of one @-@ thousandth of a second . At the end of the session , the three fastest drivers had all set the same laptime , the first time this had happened in the history of the World Championship . Jacques Villeneuve was first to set a time of 1 : 21 @.@ 072 , fourteen minutes into the one hour session . A further fourteen minutes later , Michael Schumacher posted an identical time . With nine minutes of the session remaining , Heinz @-@ Harald Frentzen crossed the line , again with a time of 1 : 21 @.@ 072 . Under the regulations , in the event of drivers setting equal times in qualifying , the order in which the times were set is considered , with the first driver to set the time given precedence . Villeneuve was awarded pole position on the starting grid for the race , with Schumacher second and Frentzen third . Fourth place on the grid went to the reigning World Champion , Damon Hill , in his Arrows , with a time of 1 : 21 @.@ 130 , 0 @.@ 058 seconds behind the time of the leading three . Hill had been on course to get pole position but had to slow towards the end of the lap because of yellow flags due to an incident involving Ukyo Katayama 's Minardi .

 The race took place in the afternoon from 14 : 00 CET ( UTC + 1 ) , in dry and sunny weather . Villeneuve started the race in pole position , with Schumacher in second . Just a few moments before the start of the race , a blue liquid came out of Villeneuve 's Williams . However , this did not influence his car during the race . Schumacher 's getaway at the start was better than Villeneuve 's and he had taken the lead by the time they reached the first corner . Schumacher would lead 40 of the first 47 laps of the race Frentzen also got a better start than Villeneuve and overtook him . Under the orders of the Williams team , on lap eight Frentzen let teammate Villeneuve past . Schumacher made his first pit @-@ stop on lap 22 and Villeneuve made his first stop the following lap . Both retained their positions . During the first round of pitstops the McLarens swapped places with David Coulthard leading Mika Häkkinen and Frentzen dropped to fifth position behind both of them . The order of the leaders after the second round of pitstops on lap 43 and lap 44 remained the same but with Villeneuve closer to Schumacher . 
 Villeneuve went into lap 48 less than a second behind Schumacher . Partway through the lap he attempted to overtake Schumacher at the Dry Sack corner . Braking later than Schumacher , Villeneuve held the inside line and was ahead on the track when Schumacher turned in on him resulting in a collision . ITV 's then pit lane reporter James Allen has noted that onboard footage shows Schumacher twitching his steering wheel left before turning right into Villeneuve . Martin Brundle , in the commentary box alongside Murray Walker , immediately saw that Schumacher 's move had been deliberate , saying , " That didn 't work Michael . You hit the wrong part of him , my friend " . The right @-@ front wheel of Schumacher 's Ferrari hit the left radiator pod of Villeneuve 's Williams — unlike the 1994 collision with Hill where Schumacher inflicted damage on Hill 's suspension — and caused Schumacher to retire . Villeneuve described the incident after the race " The car felt very strange . The hit was very hard . It was not a small thing . " He continued but the damage to his car meant he was slower than the cars behind him . 
 At the time of the incident there were 22 laps of the race remaining . The slower pace of Villeneuve 's car meant that on the last lap , he had been caught by both McLarens , Häkkinen having regained second place from Coulthard under team orders . After the race Villeneuve stated " I did not fight then . It was better to let them through and win the World Championship . It is a good exchange . " Gerhard Berger in fourth place ( in what turned out to be his final Grand Prix ) was also catching Villeneuve but he did not pass before crossing the finish line . The final margin between Villeneuve and Berger was 0 @.@ 116 seconds . Third place meant Villeneuve finished ahead of Schumacher in the drivers championship by 3 points , and was World Champion . Häkkinen 's victory was the first of his career .

 Before the race at Jerez , the president of the FIA , Max Mosley , had promised to issue penalties to anyone who tried to influence the outcome of the championship . Race officials issued a statement following the race stating that they had " unanimously concluded it was a racing accident and no further action is necessary " . However Schumacher was subsequently summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the FIA and on November 11 , 1997 it was announced that Schumacher would be disqualified from the 1997 World Championship . This meant he lost his second place in the overall standings to Heinz @-@ Harald Frentzen but he would retain his race victories and other results and would not be fined or face any further punishment in the following season . Max Mosley stated that the panel " concluded that although the actions were deliberate they were not premeditated " . Schumacher was also ordered to take part in a road @-@ safety campaign during the 1998 season . 
 Ferrari also escaped unpunished despite Article 123 of the FIA International Sporting Code stating : " The entrant shall be responsible for all acts or omissions on the part of the driver . " Under this rule , which has never been invoked for a driving incident , Ferrari could have been punished for failing to control its driver . When questioned on the subject Max Mosley said that the World Council had decided not to invoke Article 123 . Another question which the World Council failed to address was whether or not there would be any public sanction against the stewards at Jerez , who had dismissed the Schumacher @-@ Villeneuve incident , which , has been claimed , was a dereliction of their duty . 
 = = = Media reaction = = = 
 The German newspapers were among the many from across Europe that attacked Schumacher . Bild said " Schumacher was to blame for the crash " . " He played for high stakes and lost everything – the World Championship and his reputation for fair play . There is no doubt that he wanted to take out Villeneuve . " The Frankfurter Allgemeine called him " a kamikaze without honour " and commented that the " monument is starting to crack because the foundations are faulty " . A German TV station asked fans for their views and received the views of 63 @,@ 081 votes . 28 % said they could not support Schumacher any longer . 
 In Italy there was widespread condemnation of Schumacher . The daily newspaper l 'Unità called for him to be fired by Ferrari . " Schumacher ought to face charges in a Spanish court for the grave deed he committed " it reported . " The driver covered himself , Ferrari and Italian sport as a whole with shame . We are waiting for Ferrari to announce that it is throwing out Michael Schumacher and hiring a new driver who is more intelligent , has more wisdom and a real sense of morality . " 
 La Repubblica reported that " seeing a world title vanish after waiting 18 years is sad enough . But to see it go up in smoke with the move from Michael Schumacher is unfortunately much worse . It 's shameful . " Gazzetta dello Sport said that if Ferrari had won the title it would have been " a title to hide " and said that it preferred to go on waiting for the day when " our passion for Ferrari has a happy ending . " Even La Stampa , the newspaper owned by the Agnelli family , which also controls Ferrari , said " His image as a champion was shattered , like a glass hit by a stone . " 
 In the British newspapers , Schumacher 's manoeuvre against Damon Hill at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix was used as a comparison in many of the reports . The Daily Mail reported that Schumacher had now " lost the last vestige of his reputation of being a sportsman " and The Times wrote that Schumacher had " sacrificed his reputation by an act of such cynicism that it lost him the right to any sympathy " . 
 Ferrari hosted a press conference on the Tuesday after Jerez during which Schumacher admitted that he had made a mistake but said it was a misjudgement rather than a deliberate attempt to take out Villeneuve . " I am human like everyone else and unfortunately I made a mistake , " he said . " I don 't make many but I did this time . " In their respective books on Schumacher , James Allen and Swiss motorsports author Luc Domenjoz have both since expressed the view that Villeneuve went into the corner too fast , and without Schumacher turning into him would have overshot the turn .

 On December 12 , 1997 , the World Motorsport Council ruled that the mayor of Jerez , Pedro Pacheco , disrupted the podium ceremony . Originally , the verdict was that no further Formula One races would occur at the track . However , when Mr Pacheco appeared before the WMSC , this ruling was rescinded . 
 The people chosen to present the trophies were dependent on the race order , with Daimler @-@ Benz chairman Jürgen Schrempp only willing to make a presentation to a McLaren @-@ Mercedes driver . As the McLarens of Häkkinen and Coulthard passed Villeneuve 's Williams on the last lap , this would have meant he could present either the trophy for first or second position or the winning constructor trophy . There was some confusion due to the late changes in position and whilst the Mayor and the president of the region presented trophies , Schrempp did nothing . FIA president Max Mosley later announced " The disruption caused embarrassment and inconvenience to those presenting the trophies and therefore , no further rounds of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship will be held at the Jerez circuit . " As of 2016 , this race was the last time that Jerez hosted a Formula One Grand Prix , although it held many pre @-@ season test days . 
 = = = <unk> allegations = = = 
 On November 8 , The Times newspaper published an article accusing Williams and McLaren of colluding to decide the finishing order at the end of the Grand Prix . The article 's claims were based on recordings of the radio transmissions made by the two teams . The FIA World Council rejected the claims when the matter was brought before them . FIA president Max Mosley stated " It is quite clear that the result of the race was not fixed . There was no arrangement between McLaren and Williams that Mika Häkkinen was going to win . They were able to demonstrate very clearly that was not the case . " 
 In 2006 , Norberto Fontana claimed in an interview with the Argentinian newspaper Olé that a few hours before the Grand Prix the Ferrari team director Jean Todt visited the Sauber motorhome and told the Swiss team , which used Ferrari engines at the time , that the Saubers must block Jacques Villeneuve if they were in a position to do so in order to help Michael Schumacher win the World Championship . 
 The Sauber team owner and manager at the time , Peter Sauber has however denied these allegations and said " Ferrari never expressed the desire that we should obstruct an opponent of Schumacher on the track " . 
 In 2014 David Coulthard gave an interview to Charles Bradley in Autosport where he claimed that indeed an agreement between McLaren and Williams was in place . " Ron [ Dennis ] had made that deal with Frank [ Williams ] , which none of us knew anything about , that if we helped Williams in their quest to beat Ferrari they wouldn 't get in the way of helping McLaren . Ron would probably still deny it today . That 's what happened " .

 = Washington State Route 308 = 
 State Route 308 ( SR 308 ) is a 3 @.@ 42 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 5 @.@ 50 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Washington , serving the community of Keyport in Kitsap County . The highway travels generally east from an interchange with SR 3 east of Naval Base Kitsap at Bangor to the main entrance of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Keyport . SR 308 was codified as the Keyport branch of State Road 21 in 1929 and continued as the Keyport branch of Primary State Highway 21 ( PSH 21 ) in 1937 . During the 1964 highway renumbering , the branch became a section of SR 303 , which ran from Bremerton to Bangor and had a spur route serving Keyport . SR 308 was established in 1971 along the old route of SR 303 Spur and was extended in 1991 to the SR 3 freeway after SR 303 was re @-@ routed onto a new freeway in Silverdale . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 308 begins as <unk> Road at a diamond interchange with SR 3 east of Naval Base Kitsap at Bangor . The highway travels east through wooded land , intersecting several minor roads until the roadway turns northeast and crosses over Liberty Bay into the unincorporated community of Keyport . Within Keyport , SR 308 passes the Naval Undersea Museum and serves as the main thoroughfare through the community before it ends at the main entrance to the Naval Undersea Warfare Center , continuing east as Strom Avenue into the base . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of the highway was between SR 3 and Liberty Bay , serving 11 @,@ 000 vehicles , while the least busy section was the bridge over Liberty Bay , serving 6 @,@ 300 vehicles .

 The current route of SR 308 was first added to the state highway system in 1929 as the Keyport branch of State Road 21 and was carried over to the primary and secondary state highway system in 1937 as a branch of PSH 21 . The branch traveled 2 @.@ 34 miles ( 3 @.@ 77 km ) east from PSH 21 near Naval Submarine Base Bangor to the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Keyport , intersecting Secondary State Highway 21B ( SSH 21B ) before crossing Liberty Bay . The Keyport branch was incorporated into SR 303 , which replaced SSH 21B , with a short spur route serving Keyport . SR 308 was established in 1971 to replace the Keyport spur of SR 303 and extended over SR 303 in 1991 to SR 3 after SR 303 was moved south to end in Silverdale .

 = Amanita phalloides = 
 Amanita phalloides / <unk> <unk> / , commonly known as the death cap , is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus , one of many in the genus Amanita . Widely distributed across Europe , A. phalloides forms ectomycorrhizas with various broadleaved trees . In some cases , the death cap has been introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non @-@ native species of oak , chestnut , and pine . The large fruiting bodies ( mushrooms ) appear in summer and autumn ; the caps are generally greenish in colour , with a white stipe and gills . 
 These toxic mushrooms resemble several edible species ( most notably caesar 's mushroom and the straw mushroom ) commonly consumed by humans , increasing the risk of accidental poisoning . Amatoxins , the class of toxins found in these mushrooms , are thermostable : they resist changes due to heat and so , unlike many ingested poisons , their toxic effects are not reduced by cooking . Some amatoxins will cause irritation and severe pain and even damage to the eyes and skin on contact . They can be absorbed through the skin leading to the same potentially lethal effects as ingestion or inhalation . 
 A. phalloides is one of the most poisonous of all known toadstools . It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human . It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning , possibly including the deaths of Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740 . It has been the subject of much research , and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated . The principal toxic constituent is α @-@ amanitin , which damages the liver and kidneys , causing hepatic and renal failure which can be fatal . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The death cap was first described by French botanist Sébastien Vaillant in 1727 , who gave a succinct phrase name " Fungus phalloides , annulatus , <unk> virescens , et <unk> " , which is still recognizable as the fungus today . Though the scientific name phalloides means " phallus @-@ shaped " , it is unclear whether it is named for its resemblance to a literal phallus or the stinkhorn mushrooms Phallus . In 1821 , Elias Magnus Fries described it as Agaricus phalloides , but included all white amanitas within its description . Finally in 1833 , Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link settled on the name Amanita phalloides , after Persoon had named it Amanita viridis 30 years earlier . Although Louis Secretan 's use of the name Amanita phalloides predates Link 's , it has been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan 's works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently ; some taxonomists have , however , disagreed with this opinion . 
 Amanita phalloides is the type species of Amanita section Phalloideae , a group that contains all of the deadly poisonous Amanita species thus far identified . Most notable of these are the species known as destroying angels , namely Amanita virosa and Amanita bisporigera , as well as the fool 's mushroom ( A. verna ) . The term " destroying angel " has been applied to A. phalloides at times , but " death cap " is by far the most common vernacular name used in English . Other common names also listed include " stinking amanita " and " deadly amanita " . 
 A rarely appearing , all @-@ white form was initially described A. phalloides f. alba by Max <unk> , though its status has been unclear . It is often found growing amid normally colored death caps . It has been described , in 2004 , as a distinct variety and includes what was termed A. verna var. tarda . The true Amanita verna fruits in spring and turns yellow with KOH solution , whereas A. phalloides never does . 
 = = Description = = 
 The death cap has a large and imposing epigeous ( aboveground ) fruiting body ( basidiocarp ) , usually with a pileus ( cap ) from 5 to 15 cm ( 2 to 6 in ) across , initially rounded and hemispherical , but flattening with age . The color of the cap can be pale- , yellowish- , or olive @-@ green , often paler toward the margins and often paler after rain . The cap surface is sticky when wet and easily peeled , a troublesome feature , as that is allegedly a feature of edible fungi . The remains of the partial veil are seen as a <unk> , floppy annulus usually about 1 @.@ 0 to 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 39 to 0 @.@ 59 in ) below the cap . The crowded white lamellae ( gills ) are free . The stipe is white with a scattering of grayish @-@ olive scales and is 8 to 15 cm ( 3 to 6 in ) long and 1 to 2 centimetres ( 3 ⁄ 8 to 3 ⁄ 4 in ) thick , with a swollen , ragged , sac @-@ like white volva ( base ) . As the volva , which may be hidden by leaf litter , is a distinctive and diagnostic feature , it is important to remove some debris to check for it . 
 The smell has been described as initially faint and honey @-@ sweet , but strengthening over time to become overpowering , sickly @-@ sweet and objectionable . Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a universal veil , which then breaks , leaving the volva as a remnant . The spore print is white , a common feature of Amanita . The transparent spores are globular to egg @-@ shaped , measure 8 – 10 μm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 4 mil ) long , and stain blue with iodine . The gills , in contrast , stain pallid lilac or pink with concentrated sulfuric acid . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The death cap is native to Europe , where it is widespread . It is found from the southern coastal regions of Scandinavia in the north , to Ireland in the west , east to Poland and western Russia , and south throughout the Balkans , in Italy , Spain and Portugal , and in Morocco and Algeria in north Africa . In west Asia it has been reported from forests of northern Iran . There are records from further east in Asia but these have yet to be confirmed as A. phalloides . 
 It is <unk> associated with several tree species and is symbiotic with them . In Europe , these include hardwood and , less frequently , conifer species . It appears most commonly under oaks , but also under beeches , chestnuts , horse @-@ chestnuts , birches , <unk> , <unk> , pines , and spruces . In other areas , A. phalloides may also be associated with these trees or with only some species and not others . In coastal California , for example , A. phalloides is associated with coast live oak , but not with the various coastal pine species , such as Monterey pine . In countries where it has been introduced , it has been restricted to those exotic trees with which it would associate in its natural range . There is , however , evidence of A. phalloides associating with hemlock and with genera of the Myrtaceae : Eucalyptus in Tanzania and Algeria , and Leptospermum and Kunzea in New Zealand . This suggests the species may have invasive potential . 
 By the end of the 19th century , Charles Horton Peck had reported A. phalloides in North America . In 1918 , samples from the eastern United States were identified as being a distinct though similar species , A. brunnescens , by G. F. Atkinson of Cornell University . By the 1970s , it had become clear that A. phalloides does occur in the United States , apparently having been introduced from Europe alongside chestnuts , with populations on the West and East Coasts . Although a 2006 historical review concluded the East Coast populations were introduced , the origins of the West Coast populations remained unclear , due to scant historical records . A 2009 genetic study provided strong evidence for the introduced status of the fungus on the west coast of North America . 
 Amanita phalloides has been conveyed to new countries across the Southern Hemisphere with the importation of hardwoods and conifers . Introduced oaks appear to have been the vector to Australia and South America ; populations under oaks have been recorded from Melbourne and Canberra ( where two people died in January 2012 , of four who were poisoned ) and Adelaide , as well as Uruguay . It has been recorded under other introduced trees in Argentina and Chile . Pine plantations are associated with the fungus in Tanzania and South Africa , where it is also found under oaks and poplars . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 As the common name suggests , the fungus is highly toxic , and is responsible for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide . Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades , and 30 grams ( 1 @.@ 1 ounces ) , or half a cap , of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human . In 2006 , a family of three in Poland was poisoned , resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants . Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them . Furthermore , the toxicity is not reduced by cooking , freezing , or drying . 
 = = = Similarity to edible species = = = 
 In general , poisoning incidents are unintentional and result from errors in identification . Recent cases highlight the issue of the similarity of A. phalloides to the edible paddy straw mushroom , Volvariella volvacea , with <unk> and Southeast @-@ Asian immigrants in Australia and the west coast of the United States falling victim . In an episode in Oregon , four members of a Korean family required liver transplants . Of the 9 people poisoned in the Canberra region between 1988 and 2011 , three were from Laos and two were from China . This misidentification is a leading cause of mushroom poisoning in the United States . 
 Novices may mistake juvenile death caps for edible puffballs or mature specimens for other edible Amanita species , such as A. lanei , so some authorities recommend avoiding the collecting of Amanita species for the table altogether . The white form of A. phalloides may be mistaken for edible species of Agaricus , especially the young fruitbodies whose unexpanded caps conceal the telltale white gills ; all mature species of Agaricus have dark @-@ colored gills . 
 In Europe , other similarly green @-@ capped species collected by mushroom hunters include various green @-@ hued brittlegills of the genus Russula and the formerly popular Tricholoma equestre , now regarded as hazardous owing to a series of restaurant poisonings in France . <unk> , such as Russula heterophylla , R. aeruginea , and R. virescens , can be distinguished by their brittle flesh and the lack of both volva and ring . Other similar species include A. subjunquillea in eastern Asia and A. <unk> , which ranges from Andean Colombia north at least as far as central Mexico , both of which are also poisonous . 
 In January 2012 , four people were accidentally poisoned when death caps ( reportedly misidentified as straw fungi , which are popular in Chinese and other Asian dishes ) were served at a New Year 's Eve dinner party in Canberra , Australia . All the victims required hospital treatment and two of them died , with a third requiring a liver transplant . 
 = = = Biochemistry = = = 
 The species is now known to contain two main groups of toxins , both <unk> ( ring @-@ shaped ) peptides , spread throughout the mushroom tissue : the amatoxins and the phallotoxins . Another toxin is <unk> , which has shown some hemolytic ( red blood cell – destroying ) activity in vitro . An unrelated compound , <unk> , has also been isolated . 
 Amatoxins consist of at least eight compounds with a similar structure , that of eight amino @-@ acid rings ; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf <unk> of the University of Munich . Of the amatoxins , α @-@ amanitin is the chief component and along with β @-@ amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects . Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II , a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) , microRNA , and small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) . Without mRNA , essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind to a halt and the cell dies . The liver is the principal organ affected , as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract , though other organs , especially the kidneys , are susceptible . The RNA polymerase of Amanita phalloides is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins , so the mushroom does not poison itself . 
 The phallotoxins consist of at least seven compounds , all of which have seven similar peptide rings . <unk> was isolated in 1937 by Feodor <unk> , Heinrich Wieland 's student and son @-@ in @-@ law , and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich . Though phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells , they have since been found to add little to the death cap 's toxicity , as they are not absorbed through the gut . Furthermore , phalloidin is also found in the edible ( and sought @-@ after ) <unk> ( Amanita rubescens ) . Another group of minor active peptides are the <unk> , which consist of six similar <unk> <unk> . Like the phallotoxins , they do not induce any acute toxicity after ingestion in humans . 
 = = = Signs and symptoms = = = 
 Death caps have been reported to taste pleasant . This , coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms — during which time internal organs are being severely , sometimes irreparably , damaged — makes it particularly dangerous . Initially , symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain , with watery diarrhea , nausea , and vomiting , which may lead to dehydration if left untreated , and , in severe cases , hypotension , tachycardia , hypoglycemia , and acid – base disturbances . These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion . A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur — jaundice , diarrhea , delirium , seizures , and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver @-@ removed substance in the blood . Kidney failure ( either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic kidney damage ) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage . Life @-@ threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure , intracranial bleeding , pancreatic inflammation , acute kidney failure , and cardiac arrest . Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning .
