 On April 23 , 2013 , " Super Collider " was released as the album 's lead single through iTunes . Several days earlier , the track debuted on an edition of the Full Metal Jackie radio show . A video was also produced for the song . The track deviates from a more traditional metal style in favor of a more radio @-@ oriented rock sound , which Mustaine claims was done to show the record label that the band could write and play more commercially accessible material . Mustaine also stated that while the track drew some inspiration from particle <unk> and the search for the " God particle " , the lyrical meaning was less scientific . 
 On May 18 , 2013 " Kingmaker " was announced and released for streaming via YouTube . Mustaine has revealed that " Kingmaker " was written about painkiller abuse and dependency . He also said that he had altered the lyrics many times to " fit the intention " of the song . Additionally , " Built for War " was featured on an episode of NCIS : Los Angeles on October 8 , 2013 . 
 Mustaine has elaborated on the subject matter of several of the album 's other songs as well . He has noted that " Forget to Remember " was intentionally written in an ambiguous way so that it could interpreted as being about either a person trying to forget about a relationship or someone who suffers from Alzheimer 's disease and has memory problems . He also compared the concept behind the song to the film The Notebook . " The Blackest Crow " has a Southern influence and features a slide guitar , while the lyrics are about loss and subsequent depression . Mustaine initially hoped to have a guest feature on the song , and reached out to country musicians Willie Nelson and Miranda Lambert ; however , neither appeared on the song . " Don 't Turn Your Back ... " was inspired by a friend of Mustaine , who described him as " the kind of guy that will steal your dope and then help you look for it . " 
 " Cold Sweat " is a Thin Lizzy cover , originally appearing on Thunder and Lightning ( 1983 ) . Excluding bonus tracks , it is the first cover song to appear on a Megadeth album since " Anarchy in the UK " , a Sex Pistols cover , was included on So Far , So Good ... So What ! in 1988 . Mustaine said he had been wanting to cover the song since the early 1990s .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 The album received mixed to negative reviews from music critics . Much of the criticism of the album centers around Mustaine 's lyrics and / or vocals and the return to more commercial @-@ sounding material , from the heavier approach that the band had taken on the last several releases . Some reviewers compared Super Collider to Risk , the band 's much @-@ critiqued 1999 studio effort which saw Mustaine attempting to take more commercial risks with the band 's music . Many critics named " Kingmaker " as a highlight , even those who took a generally dismissive view of the rest of the album . 
 Positive comments did come from Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger and Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles reviewer Mark Gromen . Monger commented that the album had a few good songs ( " Kingmaker " , " Built for War " and " The Blackest Crow " ) , but commented that the remainder of the album " is so mired in midtempo drudgery and familiar hard rock ( not thrash ) tropes that it never really connects " , giving the album a 2 @.@ 5 / 5 star rating . Gromen showed more sympathy towards the album , and commented that although it is more of a rock record than recent albums such as United Abominations or Endgame , he felt that one song , " Built for War " , had a " Rust in Peace feel . " Gromen did criticize " Burn ! " for having mundane lyrics . 
 Another generally positive review came from Blabbermouth.net reviewer Ray Van Horn , Jr . , who gave the album a 7 @.@ 5 / 10 score despite noting that he felt the album had numerous flaws . Specific praise was directed at many of Ellefson 's bass parts , as well as much of the guitar solo work on the album . Van Horn declared that the album is no Risk despite the insistence of other critics and fans , but expressed uncertainty as to which sonic direction the band might take in the future . Chad Bowar of Loudwire had a mixed overall opinion on the album and mainly criticized the album for being more akin to Risk and The World Needs a Hero than other recent albums . Bowar gave reserved praise for the tracks " Kingmaker " and the band 's cover of " Cold Sweat " . 
 Other reviewers generally took a more dismissive view of the album , and many of them gave the album a rating of around 5 / 10 or lower . Greg Pratt of Exclaim ! described much of the material on the album as being an attempt on Mustaine 's part to both maintain credibility with his fanbase and score a radio hit at the same time , a result that Pratt concluded was impossible . Pratt took a negative view of several songs on the album , describing " Off the Edge " as " unlovable " , " The Blackest Crow " as " an unfocused mess " , and the title track as having a radio @-@ oriented sound , much to his dislike . However , he did describe " Kingmaker " as " relentless " , and commented that it sounded similar to material from Countdown to Extinction ( 1992 ) . 
 Dean Brown of PopMatters wrote a highly critical review of the album . He characterized the title track as a " ghastly attempt " at arena rock that " even Bon Jovi would have thought twice about releasing as a B @-@ side . " Brown reacted positively to " Kingmaker , " though noted that the song seems to " pillage " Black Sabbath 's " Children of the Grave . " Many of the remaining songs on the album were criticized by Brown for being " cliché , " " pathetic " and / or " awkward , " among other things .

 = Mexican National Trios Championship = 
 The Mexican National Trios Championship ( Campeonato National Trios in Spanish ) is a three @-@ man tag team professional wrestling championship , sanctioned by the " Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F. " ( Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission ) , which oversees all matches where the championship is defended . Since its creation in 1985 the championship has been promoted by several major Mexican wrestling promotions , Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre ( EMLL ) , Asistencia Asesoría y Administración ( AAA ) and is currently promoted by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ( CMLL , formerly EMLL ) . The change from promotion to promotion was approved by the commission if the trios champions left one promotion to work for the other . As it is a professional wrestling championship , it is not won or lost competitively , but instead by the decision of the bookers of a wrestling promotion . The title is awarded to a team after the team " wins " a match to maintain the illusion that professional wrestling is a competitive sport . All title matches take place under two @-@ out @-@ of @-@ three falls rules . 
 In the early 1980s the six @-@ man tag team match became very popular in Mexico , to the point where that match format is the most prevalent format in Lucha Libre today . The Universal Wrestling Association created the UWA World Trios Championship in 1984 and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission created the Mexican National Trios Championship in 1985 , making it only the second Trios championship in Mexico . Control of the championship was given to EMLL , the UWA 's main rival at the time , with the commission retaining oversight and approval of the championship matches . In 1993 then champions Los Infernales ( " The Infernal Ones " ; MS @-@ 1 , Pirata Morgan , and El Satánico ) left EMLL to join AAA , taking the trios championship with them after approval by the commission . In the late 1990s the championship was not promoted on a regular basis by AAA and appeared inactive until the champions , Blue Panther , Fuerza Guerrera , and El Signo , joined CMLL in 2001 and lost the championship to a CMLL team . From that point forward the championship has been controlled by CMLL once more . 
 The current Mexican National Trios Champions is the team known as Los Hijos del Infierno ( " The Sons of the Inferno " ; Ephesto , Luciferno , and Mephisto ) , who won the championship on August 9 , 2015 when they defeated previous champions Los Reyes de la Atlantida ( " The Kings of the Atlantis " ; Atlantis , Delta , and Guerrero Maya Jr . ) This is the team 's first reign as a team and they are the 39th overall champions . Los Reyes de la Atlantida hold the record for most reigns as a team , with three reigns in total , while Atlantis , Delta and Volador Jr. holds the individual record with four reigns each . 
 = = History = = 
 With the emergence of trios ( tag teams consisting of three people ) such as Los <unk> de la Muerte , Los Brazos and more , the six @-@ man tag team match became increasingly popular in the early 1980s . Its popularity led to the trios format becoming the most prevalent match format in Lucha libre to this day . The popularity led to the creation of the first trios championship in Mexico when the Universal Wrestling Association ( UWA ) created the UWA World Trios Championship in 1984 . The Mexican National Trios Championship was created in 1985 , at the request of Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre ( EMLL ) and endorsed by the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission . The commission granted EMLL the rights to promote the championship , which meant that CMLL had control over the everyday use of the championship , determining which storylines the title <unk> being used in , who were allowed to challenge for the title and how to use it in a public relations sense . The Commission would oversee the rule and approves any championship change that EMLL proposed . 
 The finals of the tournament to crown the first champions saw Los Infernales ( " The Infernal Ones " ; the team of MS @-@ 1 , Pirata Morgan , and El Satánico ) defeat Los Brazos ( " The Arms " ; El Brazo , Brazo de Oro , and Brazo de Plata ) to become the first champions . Los Brazos would win the championship 9 months later but only hold them for a short while . In February 1986 Los Brazos became the first team to hold the title twice as they defeated Dos Caras , Villano III , and Villano IV for the championship . EMLL rebranded themselves " Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre " ( " World Wrestling Council " ) in 1991 and created the CMLL World Trios Championship but also kept the rights to the Mexican National Trios Championship . In 1992 Asistencia Asesoría y Administración ( AAA ) was formed by a group of officials and wrestlers who broke away from CMLL . The then @-@ reigning champions Cien Caras , Máscara Año 2000 , and Universo 2000 left CMLL to join AAA and brought the Mexican National Trios Championship with them as it was not a CMLL owned title . The Commission granted <unk> right to control the title from 1992 on , later on when AAA began working with <unk> Mexicana de Lucha Libre ( PROMELL ) both promotions were allowed used the Trios title by the commission . In 1996 AAA and PROMELL stopped working together and the title was vacated . PROMELL was granted the right to promote the title from that point on and held a tournament to crown new champions . Blue Panther , Fuerza Guerrera , and El Signo won the tournament and would go on to hold the titles for 1 @,@ 728 days , although for the majority of the time the three did not team up and the Trios championship was inactive . In 2001 the trio worked a couple of matches for CMLL , just long enough for them to lose the championship to Mr. Niebla , Olímpico , and Safari , bringing the championship back under CMLL 's control , where it has remained ever since . 
 On June 13 , 2003 a championship match between champions La Familia de Tijuana ( Nicho el Millonario , Damián 666 , and Halloween ) and Los Nuevo Infernales ( <unk> , Averno , and Mephisto ) , ended with La Familia being disqualified . The disqualification meant that the titles would change hands , but Los Nuevo Infernales refused to win the championship in such a manner . A rematch was set up for June 20 , but Nicho el Millonario did not show up for the match . CMLL held an eight @-@ team tournament to determine the next championship trio , ending with El Felino , Safari and Volador , Jr. become the 23rd Trios champions . In 2010 Máscara Dorada teamed up with Stuka Jr . , and Metro to win the Trios championship , making Dorada a quadruple champion as he also held the CMLL World Super Lightweight Championship , CMLL World Trios Championship , and the CMLL World Welterweight Championship at the time . In November , 2010 Dorada suffered a knee injury and relinquished his portion of the Mexican National Trios Championship . Delta was selected as his replacement via a fan vote , but the team lost the trios championship in the first defense against the team of Ángel de Oro , Diamante ( who were the other two options for Dorada 's replacement ) and Rush . 
 = = Rules = = 
 The title is a " National " title which means that non @-@ Mexican citizens are prohibited from challenging or holding the championship . As it is a professional wrestling championship , it is not won legitimately ; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match . The fact that the championship is a " trios " championship means that it 's restricted to Tag teams with three members . The championship is generally not allowed to be defended in any other type of match than a regular match , as is the case for all the Mexican National titles . The commission has been inconsistent on enforcing the rules , in one case they stripped Psicosis of the Mexican National Middleweight Championship for defending it in a hardcore match , in another case they allowed the Mexican National Heavyweight Championship to change hands in a Steel cage match . On occasion single fall title matches have taken place , for example when promoting CMLL title matches in Japan , conforming to the traditions of the local promotion .

 Los Hijos del Infierno ( " The Sons of the Inferno " ; Ephesto , Luciferno , and Mephisto ) are the current champions , after defeating the trio known as Los Reyes de la Atlantida ( " The Kings of the Atlantis " ; Atlantis , Delta and Guerrero Maya Jr . ) for the title on August 9 , 2015 . It is the team 's first reign as a team and they are the 39th overall champions . Los Reyes de la Atlantida hold the record for most reigns as a team , with three , while Atlantis , Delta and Volador Jr. have all held the championship on four separate occasions . Blue Panther , Fuerza Guerrera and El Signo is the team with the longest reign of 1 @,@ 728 days while Los <unk> and the trio of Dos Caras , Villano III and Villano IV both held the title for only 26 days , which is the shortest time of any championship team . 
 Several championship teams have lost the championship in their first defense , while the teams of Sagrado , La Sombra , Volador Jr . , and El Felino , Safari , Volador Jr. both are credited with six successful title defenses before losing the championship , the most of any of the 39 championship teams . In 1991 the Commission allowed El Ninja to replace the injured <unk> during a championship defense , helping Los Thundercats retain the title against the team of Rocky Santana , El Gallego and Romano Garcia .

 Much like the previous year , one @-@ third of the reigning Mexican National Trios Champions was unable to further help defend the title . This year , CMLL resolved the situation differently , but still managed to organize in a tournament . The champions , Mascara Dorada , Stuka Jr . , and Metro , successfully defended their championship on November 15 , 2010 , in Arena Puebla . Dorada suffered an ankle injury during the course of the match . Citing both the injury ( which would keep him out a month ) and , more so , the demands of his other three championships , Mascara Dorada vacated his share of the titles three days later . CMLL broke with the precedent of forcing the entire team to vacate the titles and instead declared a web poll would determine a replacement for Mascara Dorada . Voting was held for over two weeks on <unk> 
 Delta - 41 @.@ 52 % 
 Ángel de Oro - 39 @.@ 20 %

 CMLL appeared to waver about the winner becoming the champion or just joining Stuka and Metro for a title match . CMLL 's website indicated Delta won the championship , but Delta 's team did not wear the championship belts prior to their first title match . Concurrent with the poll , CMLL started running an eight @-@ team , three @-@ week tournament to find new challengers for the new champions .

 Drum is a 2004 film based on the life of South African investigative journalist Henry Nxumalo , who worked for the popular Drum magazine , called " the first black lifestyle magazine in Africa . " It was director Zola Maseko 's first film and deals with the issues of apartheid and the forced removal of residents from Sophiatown . The film was originally to be a six @-@ part television series called Sophiatown Short Stories , though Maseko could not get the funding . The lead roles of Henry Nxumalo and Drum main photographer Jürgen Schadeberg were played by American actors Taye Diggs and Gabriel Mann , while most of the rest of the cast were South African actors . 
 The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2004 , and proceeded to do the rounds of international film festivals before going on general release in South Africa in July 2006 . It was released in Europe , but failed to get a distributor for the USA where it went straight to DVD . 
 The film was generally well received critically . Most of the negative reviews were based on the quality of Maseko 's directing and Jason Filardi 's screenwriting . It was awarded Best South African Film at the Durban International Film Festival , and director Maseko gained the top prize at the <unk> Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou ( FESPACO ) . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The story is based on real events and real people and is set in the mid @-@ 1950s freehold township of Sophiatown , Johannesburg — one of the few areas in South Africa where blacks could own property and drink alcoholic beverages . Drum begins with the central character , sportswriter Henry Nxumalo , reporting on a boxing match with Nelson Mandela . Nxumalo leaves his wife Florence at home while going out into his community 's night life and has an affair with a female singer . He works for Drum magazine , which was " the first black lifestyle magazine in Africa . " The magazine was financed by whites and had a multiracial staff ; it was popular among the black community . Drum 's British editor , Jim Bailey ( Jason Flemyng ) , asks Nxumalo to write on the township crime scene , and Nxumalo , while at first unwilling , finally agrees . While on the job , he encounters Slim ( Zola ) , a gang leader , that he had previously met in illegal township drinking places , and witnesses him kill a man in Sophiatown . 
 Initially Nxumalo stays away from political articles , but eventually writes about more than entertainment after his wife and Mandela encourage him . When a young man goes missing at a Boer farm and is feared enslaved , Nxumalo decides to investigate undercover . He gets employment as a labourer at the farm , where he is treated like a slave and nearly killed . He becomes a celebrity when his story is published , further reinforced by getting himself in prison and reporting about its conditions . Nxumalo decides that his destiny is to be a <unk> and , with the help of the German photographer Jürgen Schadeberg ( Gabriel Mann ) , ventures on more risky investigations . 
 Nxumalo frequently fights the racism and apartheid that is beginning to creep into his hometown . He tries to tackle stories important to his society 's well @-@ being . However , he is no match to the plan to evict residents and ultimately destroy Sophiatown . Constantly harassed by the government , at the end of the film he is stabbed to death . The attacker has never been identified .

 Drum is Zola Maseko 's first feature film . He originally wanted to tell Sophiatown 's story in a six @-@ part television series called Sophiatown Short Stories . Unsuccessful in convincing the South African Television Company to pursue such a series , he decided to change the medium to that of film . He secured a large amount of his funding by convincing Taye Diggs to fill the lead role . 
 American screenwriter Jason Filardi was asked to write the script by production company Armada and subsequently " fell in love " with Drum 's plotline . In preparation for this task , he read books on Nxumalo and the history of South Africa , and stayed for a month in Johannesburg . Filardi said that his work on the film was his fondest experience with the medium . Filming began in May 2004 and lasted for six weeks . On 29 May , producer Dumisani Dlamini died after being shot in the head at his home in Johannesburg . 
 The soundtrack was written by Terence Blanchard and Cédric <unk> Samson . Much of it is a jazz score , which has been called " strong " . This is a reflection of the music that was popular during the movie 's place and time .

 Drum premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2004 . It was the lead film in the festival 's Spotlight on South Africa program .

On 21 June , Drum was screened at the Boston International Film Festival during its first session . The film opened the 2005 Filmfest München on 25 June . 
 For his work with Drum , Maseko received the top prize at FESPACO , the Golden Stallion of <unk> , in addition to a cash prize of 10 million CFA francs ( US $ 20 @,@ 000 ) at its closing ceremony in March 2005 .

 The film premièred in South Africa at the 26th Durban International Film Festival ( <unk> ) on 17 July 2005 where it won the Best South African Film Award .

Events to help promote the film included <unk> @-@ <unk> dances in various South African market places , and the production crew holding a contest in which South African schoolchildren would have to research a lost community and the winners would get to meet the actors . 
 Outside film festivals , the first release in the USA was at the Olde <unk> Village theater in Filardi 's hometown of Mystic , Connecticut , on 22 December 2006 . Despite wide releases in Europe , Drum did not obtain one in the USA , mostly due to a failure to find distributors . Instead , it went straight to DVD . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Drum was mostly met with favorable reviews . Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 86 % percent of seven critics gave the film positive write @-@ ups , a rating that it considered " Fresh " . 
 Sura Wood of The Hollywood Reporter called it " an intelligent , moving film steeped in an authentic sense of time and place . " Her sentiments were echoed by Joe Leydon of Variety , who thought Drum was " an intelligent and affecting take on political radicalization in 1950s Johannesburg . " According to Film Threat 's Jeremy Matthews , Drum was " a solid work of classical storytelling . " He observed that it was " heartbreaking in its portrayal of Johannesburg at a time when its rulers had convinced many people that whites were born to command and blacks were born to obey and serve . " 
 Critic David <unk> gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised Diggs as " fantastic " . The supporting actors also delivered " solid " performances . He believed that the film was anything but superfluous , and it moved at a fast pace . While the screenplay was predictable , Maseko 's " steady " direction " ensure [ d ] Drum 's place among better @-@ than @-@ average true @-@ life tales . " The Arizona Republic disagreed with <unk> 's first point , not thinking Diggs looked like a South African . It called the film " a well @-@ meaning but static look at apartheid in the 1950s . " 
 Shadows on the Wall 's Rich Kline noted that the storyline was " compelling and eye @-@ opening " and praised the actors as " excellent " and " committed to getting the truth out . " He was impressed with the " lively and fascinating sense of local culture " that dominated the film . Kline , who gave the film 3 out of 5 stars , was mainly concerned with the film 's " rather clumsy " direction and screenwriting . Maseko directed with " energy and verve , " though his " struggles to capture the human drama " led to the impression that Drum was " a clunky TV movie , with awkward camera angles , wonky editing and clumsy sound recording . " Filardi was guilty of a dialogue which " echoes with cliches , while contrived plotting put characters into situations that may be true , but they feel corny and movie @-@ like . " Kline also criticised the wide variety of political issues that characterised the film , though added that " maybe this helps us begin to understand what life must have been like under such an oppressive government . " 
 One of the most critical reviews was by Francesca <unk> of Boxoffice Magazine . <unk> , who gave Drum 2 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars , was unimpressed by the " unoriginal plotting techniques to convey the story of an investigative journalist attempting to expose racial injustices in a society coming to grips with the newly introduced edicts of apartheid . " Although Diggs 's acting was " engaging " , according to her the film " depends on just a few too many big @-@ screen cliches and predictable plot turns . " The " richly designed sets and costumes " were not able to overcome the less @-@ than @-@ satisfactory " Drum .

He was then assigned to Attack Squadron 115 ( VA @-@ 115 ) in Atsugi , Japan , and made two deployments to the Persian Gulf on the aircraft carrier USS Midway , flying 39 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm . After receiving his master 's degree he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School from June 1993 to June 1994 . He has logged more than 5 @,@ 000 hours in more than 50 different aircraft and has over 375 carrier landings . 
 He is the recipient of the following awards : two Defense Superior Service Medals ; four Air Medals ( two individual / two strike flight ) with Combat " V " ; one Legion of Merit ; one Distinguished Flying Cross ; two Navy Commendation Medals , one with combat " V " ) ; one Navy Achievement Medal ; two Southwest Asia Service Medals ; one Navy Expeditionary Medal ; two Sea Service Deployment Ribbons ; and an Overseas Service Ribbon . 
 On June 21 , 2011 , Kelly announced his retirement from the U.S. Navy and NASA , effective October 1 , 2011 . His retirement was announced on his Facebook page , where he wrote , " Words cannot convey my deep gratitude for the opportunities I have been given to serve our great nation . From the day I entered the United States Merchant Marine Academy in the summer of 1982 to the moment I landed the Space Shuttle Endeavour three weeks ago , it has been my privilege to advance the ideals that define the United States of America .

 Mark Kelly and his brother Scott were both selected to be Shuttle pilots by NASA in 1996 . They joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in August of that year . Mark Kelly has logged over 54 days in space . 
 During his 2006 flight on Space Shuttle Discovery , the second mission after the loss of Space Shuttle Columbia , Kelly discussed the risks of flying the Space Shuttle : 
 The Space Shuttle 's a very complex machine . It 's got a lot of moving parts that move and operate at pretty much the limit of what we 've been able to engineer . Spaceflight is risky . I think with regards to the tank , we 've reduced some of the risk there . We 've changed the design a little bit and we 've made some pretty big strides in trying to get foam not to shed from the tank anymore . So there is some risk reduction there and I guess overall the risk is probably a little less . But this is a risky business , but it 's got a big reward . Everybody on board Discovery and the space station here thinks it 's worthwhile .

 Kelly 's first trip into space was as pilot of STS @-@ 108 . After several delays , Endeavour lifted off on December 5 , 2001 , on the final Shuttle mission of 2001 . 
 STS @-@ 108 Endeavour visited the ISS , delivering over three tons of equipment , supplies , and a fresh crew to the orbiting outpost . The hatches were opened between Endeavour and the ISS Destiny Laboratory on December 7 , enabling the ten crew members to greet one another . The Expedition 3 crew officially ended their 117 @-@ day residency on board the International Space Station on December 8 as their custom Soyuz seat @-@ liners were transferred to Endeavour for the return trip home . The transfer of the Expedition 4 seat @-@ liners to the Soyuz return vehicle attached to the station marked the official exchange of crews . 
 Kelly and Mission Specialist Linda Godwin used the Shuttle 's robotic arm to lift the Raffaello Multi @-@ Purpose Logistics Module from the shuttle payload bay and attach it to a berth on the station 's Unity node . The crews began unloading supplies the same day . Mission managers extended Endeavour 's flight duration to 12 days to allow the crew to assist with additional maintenance tasks on the station , including work on a treadmill and replacing a failed compressor in one of the air conditioners in the Zvezda Service Module . A change of command ceremony took place on December 13 as Expedition 3 ended and Expedition 4 began . STS @-@ 108 returned to Earth with the previous ISS crew of three men . 
 Kelly traveled over 4 @.@ 8 million miles and orbited the earth 186 times over 11 days and 19 + hours . 
 = = = = STS @-@ 121 = = = = 
 In July 2006 Kelly served as pilot for STS @-@ 121 Discovery , the second " Return to Flight " mission following the loss of Columbia in February 2003 . Because of weather delays , STS @-@ 121 became the first Shuttle mission to launch on the Fourth of July . 
 The main purposes of the mission were to test new safety and repair techniques introduced following the Columbia disaster as well as to deliver supplies , equipment , and European Space Agency ( ESA ) astronaut Thomas Reiter from Germany to the ISS . The transfer of Reiter to the ISS returned the station to a three crew member staffing level . 
 During the STS @-@ 121 mission to the ISS , the crew of Discovery continued to test new equipment and procedures for the inspection and repair of the thermal protection system that is designed to increase the safety of the Shuttles . It also delivered more supplies and cargo for future ISS expansion . 
 After the Columbia accident , NASA decided that two test flights would be required and that activities that were originally assigned to STS @-@ 114 would need to be divided into two missions because of the addition of post @-@ Columbia safety tests . 
 Gabrielle Giffords , Kelly 's girlfriend at the time , picked one of the wake @-@ up songs for the mission : " Beautiful Day " by U2 . 
 Kelly traveled over 5 @.@ 28 million miles and orbited the Earth 202 times over 12 days and 18 + hours . 
 = = = = STS @-@ 124 = = = = 
 STS @-@ 124 Discovery was Kelly 's first mission as commander . A month prior to liftoff , he discussed what being a Shuttle commander entailed and how it was different from his previous missions : 
 My first two flights I was the pilot . Being the commander is different in that you ’ re responsible for the overall mission . . . . You have to worry about the whole thing , the training drill your other crew members are getting , mission success , and mission safety . So it is a more comprehensive job and requires more time . I ’ m really a little bit surprised at how much more there is to it . But I think it ’ s more rewarding as well . 
 The mission was the second of three Shuttle missions to carry components of Japan 's Kibo laboratory to the ISS . Kibo means hope in Japanese . The laboratory is Japan 's primary contribution to the ISS . 
 Just prior to liftoff Kelly said : " While we 've all prepared for this event today , the discoveries from Kibo will definitely offer hope for tomorrow . Now stand by for the greatest show on Earth . " 
 During the launch , Launch Pad 39A sustained substantial damage , more than had been seen on any previous launch . Following liftoff , inspectors discovered that bricks and mortar from the launch pad 's base had been thrown as far as the perimeter fence , a distance of 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 457 m ) . 
 Kelly and his crew delivered the pressurized module for Kibo to the ISS . The module is the largest component of the Kibo laboratory and the station 's largest habitable module . Discovery also delivered Kibo 's Remote Manipulator System . Perhaps the most important part they delivered was a replacement part for the station 's toilet . The single toilet on the ISS had been malfunctioning for a week , creating a potentially serious problem for the crew . When Kelly first entered the station , he joked , " You looking for a plumber ? " , referring to the broken toilet . 
 This mission marked the first time a spouse of a member of the U.S. Congress traveled to space . Kelly traveled over 5 @.@ 7 million miles , and orbited the earth 218 times over 13 days and 18 hours .

 STS @-@ 134 launched on May 16 , 2011 . 
 On April 29 , 2011 , the first launch attempt of STS @-@ 134 was scrubbed . Kelly 's wife , Gabrielle Giffords , traveled to Florida on her first trip since moving from Tucson to Houston in January after an attempted assassination . Giffords ' appearance at Kennedy Space Center gave the launch a high profile , " one of the most anticipated in years , " according to the New York Times . President Obama visited the Kennedy Space Center on April 29 on a trip with the original intention of watching the Endeavour launch . 
 Kelly was the commander of the mission which was Space Shuttle Endeavour 's last . He and his crew delivered the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) to the ISS . 
 Most of the mission 's delays were caused by external tank issues on STS @-@ 133 Discovery . When Mark 's twin brother Scott Kelly went to the ISS on October 7 , 2010 , STS @-@ 134 was scheduled to go to the station during Scott 's mission . The potential rendezvous in space of the Kelly brothers would have been a first meeting of blood relatives in space . The delay of the launch of STS @-@ 134 ended the possibility of that happening . 
 After the shooting of his wife , his status as commander of STS @-@ 134 was unclear , but NASA announced on February 4 , 2011 , that Kelly would remain as commander of the mission . The remarkable progress his wife was making in her recovery helped Kelly make the decision to return to training . Peggy Whitson of NASA stated " we are confident in his ability to successfully lead this mission , and I know I speak for all of NASA in saying ' welcome back . ' "

 At 4 p.m. PDT on May 22 , the European Space Agency and Italian Space Agency arranged for a call to Endeavour by Pope Benedict XVI .

 In January 2013 , Kelly and Giffords started a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions . The mission of the organization is to promote solutions with elected officials and the general public . The couple states that it supports the Second Amendment while promoting responsible gun ownership and “ keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people like criminals , terrorists , and the mentally ill . ” Current gun laws allow for private sellers to legally sell guns without a background check , creating a loophole that provides criminals and the mentally ill easy access to guns . Kelly said on Fox News on March 31 , 2013 that “ any bill that does not include a universal background check is a mistake , It 's the most common sense thing we can do to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from having access to weapons . " 
 Other proposals from Kelly and Giffords include limiting the sale of high capacity magazines , limiting the sale of assault weapons , and stopping gun trafficking . Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR @-@ 15 rifle . The shop owner denied Mr. Kelly the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly 's previous statements on gun laws . Mr. Kelly had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department .

" The couple met on a 2003 trip to China as part of a trade mission sponsored by the National Committee on U.S. – China Relations . 
 At the time , he lived in Houston . At the time of their marriage Kelly said that the longest period of time the two had spent together in one stretch was a couple of weeks . He said that they didn 't plan to always live that way , but that 's what they were used to . He added , " It teaches you not to sweat the small stuff . " 
 = = = Shooting in Tucson = = = 
 Kelly 's wife , Representative Gabrielle Giffords , was shot in an assassination attempt on January 8 , 2011 , putting Kelly in the national spotlight . On February 4 , Kelly described the previous month as the hardest time of his life ; and he expressed his gratitude for the enormous outpouring of support , good wishes and prayers for his wife . He said that he believed people praying for her helped . 
 Kelly received word that his wife had been shot from an aide of the Congresswoman almost immediately after the shooting . He flew from Houston to Tucson with members of his family . While en route , the Kellys received an erroneous news report that Giffords had died . " The kids , Claudia and Claire , started crying . My mother , she almost screamed . I just walked into the bathroom , and , you know , broke down . " Calling family in Tucson , Kelly found out that the report was false and that she was alive and in surgery . " It was a terrible mistake , " Kelly said , " as bad as it was that she had died , it 's equally exciting that she hadn 't . " 
 From the time he arrived in Tucson , Kelly sat vigil at his wife 's bedside as she struggled to survive and began to recover . As her condition began to improve , the Kelly @-@ Giffords family researched options for rehabilitation facilities and chose one in Houston . On January 21 , Giffords was transferred to the Memorial Hermann – Texas Medical Center , where she spent five days prior to moving to <unk> Memorial Hermann , where she continued her recovery and rehabilitation . 
 Giffords and her husband had spoken dozens of times about how risky her job was . She was afraid that someone would come up to her at a public event with a gun . In an interview filmed just over a week after the shooting , Kelly said , " She has Tombstone , Arizona , in her district , the town that 's too tough to die . Gabrielle Giffords is too tough to let this beat her . "

 A memorial service for those killed was held on January 12 , 2011 , at the University of Arizona . President Barack Obama flew to Tucson to speak at the memorial . Kelly sat between First Lady Michelle Obama and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano , the previous governor of Arizona . At the end of the service , President Obama consoled and embraced him , after which Kelly returned to the hospital to be with his wife . 
 Kelly spoke on February 3 , 2011 , at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington , D.C. His remarks closed the event , where President Obama also spoke . The attack on his wife brought Kelly closer to God and gave him a newfound awareness regarding prayer . Kelly said that prior to the attack , " I thought the world just spins and the clock just ticks and things happen for no particular reason . " Kelly said that , in Tucson , as he found himself wandering in makeshift memorials and shrines , filled with Bibles and angels that " You pray where you are . You pray when God is there in your heart . " Kelly offered the final prayer of the morning . The prayer was from Rabbi Stephanie Aaron , who married Kelly and Giffords , and who said the same words over Giffords ’ on the night of the shooting : 
 In the name of God , our God of Israel , may Michael , God 's angel messenger of compassion , watch over your right side . May Gabriel , God 's angel messenger of strength and courage , be on your left . And before you , guiding your path , Uriel , God 's angel of light and behind you , supporting you , stands Raphael , God 's angel of healing . And over your head , surrounding you , is the presence of the Divine . 
 Kelly believes that there 's now a chance to change a political environment he thinks is filled with far too much vitriol . He hoped that the tragedy would also be an opportunity to improve the tone of our national dialogue and cool down the rhetoric . In response to a question on February 4 , regarding the discussions about civility in politics Kelly said : " I haven ’ t spent a lot of time following that but I think that with something that was so horrible and so negative and the fact that six people lost their lives , including a nine @-@ year old girl , a federal judge , Gabby ’ s staff member Gabe — who was like a younger brother to her — it ’ s really really a sad situation . I am hopeful that something positive can come out of it . I think that will happen , so those are good things . "

 Pontius Pilate 's wife ( Greek : <unk> ( Pilate ) , <unk> αὐτοῦ ( his wife ) ; Latin : <unk> <unk> ; fl . 1st century ) is unnamed in the New Testament , where she appears in a single verse of the Gospel of Matthew . In later Christian tradition , she is known variously as Saint Procula ( also spelled <unk> or <unk> ) , Saint Claudia , Claudia <unk> or Claudia Procula . Christian literature and legends have amplified the brief anecdote about Pilate 's wife in the New Testament . 
 = = Account in the Gospel of Matthew = = 
 In the New Testament , the only reference to Pilate 's wife exists in a single sentence by Matthew . According to Matthew 27 : 19 , she sent a message to her husband asking him not to condemn Jesus Christ to death : 
 While Pilate was sitting in the judgment hall , his wife sent him a message : " Have nothing to do with that innocent man , because in a dream last night , I suffered much on account of him . " 
 Pilate did not heed the warning of his wife , who is not named in the Gospel . 
 The name " Claudia " appears only once in the New Testament , apparently referring to a different person , in the Second Epistle to Timothy 4 : 21 : " Eubulus , <unk> , Linus and Claudia send their greetings , and so all the other Christians . " 
 = = Christian legends , traditions and theology = = 
 Pilate 's wife is referred to in the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus ( probably written around the middle of the 4th century , although it is mentioned by Justin Martyr ) , which gives a more elaborate version of the episode of the dream than Matthew . She is first named as Claudia in 1619 , in the chronicle of Pseudo @-@ Dexter . In later Christian tradition she is known as Claudia Procula . 
 In the 3rd century , Origen suggested in his Homilies on Matthew that the wife of Pilate had become a Christian , or at least that God sent her the dream mentioned by Matthew so that she would convert . This interpretation was shared by several theologians of Antiquity and the Middle Ages . Rival theologians contended the dream was sent by Satan in an attempt to thwart the salvation that was going to result from Christ 's death . 
 = = = Sainthood = = = 
 Procula is recognized as a saint in two churches within the Eastern Christian tradition : the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church . In the Eastern Orthodox Church , she is celebrated on 27 October . The Ethiopian Orthodox Church celebrates Pilate and Procula together on 25 June .

 Pilate 's wife is sometimes shown in medieval depictions of scenes including her husband . She typically stands behind him , sometimes whispering in his ear . 
 The seventeenth @-@ century English poet <unk> Lanyer ( whom A. L. Rowse believed to be the dark lady of Shakespeare 's sonnets ) wrote a poem , Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum ( 1611 ) , in which Pilate 's wife is the main speaker . She makes reference to the Fall of Adam and Eve and argues that Pilate 's sin in killing Christ <unk> the curse on Eve , since Pilate sinned by not listening to his wife ( unlike Adam , who sinned by hearkening to the voice of Eve ) . Pilate 's wife ( who is never named in Lanyer 's poem ) thereby becomes a champion of women 's emancipation . 
 She is a major character in the <unk> ' and <unk> ' Play of the York Mystery Plays cycle , where she introduces herself as " Dame Precious <unk> " . Her dream is dictated by the Devil . He first <unk> to the effect that if Jesus dies , he , the Devil , will lose control of men 's souls . He then tells the sleeping <unk> that Jesus is innocent , and that if he is condemned , she and Pilate will lose their privileged position . She wakes and sends a message to Pilate , but Annas and Caiaphas succeed in convincing him that her dream was inspired by Jesus 's witchcraft .

 Charlotte Brontë wrote the poem " Pilate 's Wife 's Dream " in 1846 . The biblical scholar Paul Maier , in Pontius Pilate : A Biographical Novel ( 1968 ) , attempts to take what is known from the documented record and from there construct a fictional narrative as connective material . Maier refers to Pilate 's wife as " Procula , " arguing that the name " Claudia " only comes from a later tradition . In his historical novel " The Advocate " , Randy Singer refers to Pilate 's wife as " Procula " and tells of an earlier vision in which she had seen and been healed by Jesus . 
 Novels inspired by Pilate 's wife include The Bride of Pilate ( 1959 ) by Esther Kellner ; and Pilate 's Wife : A Novel of the Roman Empire ( 2006 ) , & Claudia : Daughter of Rome ( 2008 ) , both by Antoinette May . All books use the name Claudia , and May 's book depicts her parents as Roman aristocrats related by blood to Emperor Augustus . Pilate 's Wife by H.D. ( Hilda Doolittle ) , written between 1929 and 1934 but posthumously published in 2000 , presents Pilate 's wife with the name Veronica . Carol Ann Duffy 's 1999 poetry collection ' The World 's Wife ' also contains a poem titled ' Pilate 's Wife ' .

 In films , Pilate 's wife was called " <unk> " in the Cecil B. DeMille epic The King of Kings ( 1927 ) ; Majel Coleman played the role . She had a major part in Julien Duvivier 's Golgotha ( 1935 ) , played by Edwige <unk> .

 Pontius Pilate 's wife also has appeared in comedy : John Case played her in Monty Python 's 1979 Life of Brian . 
 On television , Pilate ’ s wife was played by Joan Leslie in the 1951 Family Theater episode " Hill Number One " ( also starring James Dean as John the Apostle ) , and by Geraldine Fitzgerald in the 1952 Studio One episode " Pontius Pilate " ( where Procula is depicted as half @-@ Jewish , and is brought before Pilate as a Christian rebel herself , fifteen years after Jesus ' death . ) Hope Lange played her in the 1980 made @-@ for @-@ television film The Day Christ Died .

It was written by Vince Gilligan , directed by Kim Manners , and featured a guest appearance by Chad Donella . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . However , unlike previous Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week stories , " Hungry " is told from the monster 's perspective . " Hungry " earned a Nielsen household rating of 9 @.@ 6 , being watched by 16 @.@ 17 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , a fast @-@ food employee with unusual cravings becomes the focus of an FBI investigation under the direction of Mulder and Scully . The victims appear with no brain and a suction hole in the forehead . 
 Gilligan wanted to try a " different " approach to The X @-@ Files with " Hungry " by telling the main story through the eyes of the monster . Actor Chad Donella , who portrayed the monster , was chosen because he possessed a " subtle , interesting quality , " according to casting director Rick Millikan . Manners was pleased with Donella 's performance , calling him a " great little actor . " Because both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were filming movies , Return to Me and The House of Mirth respectively , the production company decided to film " Hungry " before any of the other episodes , despite the fact that it would be aired third , after the conclusion of " The Sixth Extinction " arc . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Costa Mesa , California , a young man named Donald Pankow approaches the drive @-@ thru of a Lucky Boy fast food restaurant . Despite the restaurant being closed , Pankow angrily demands service . The sheepish fast food attendant tells the man to drive to the next window , where he is attacked and violently pulled out of his car . Pankow 's body is later discovered with the brain removed from the skull . Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) are assigned to assist the local police in their investigation . 
 The only clue found at the scene is a Lucky Boy employee button . Mulder and Scully check all of the employees and discover that one of the clerks , <unk> Spinks , is missing his button . Scully suspects Spinks after it is discovered he has a criminal record . Mulder , however , believes that the victim 's brain was removed by a proboscis , and suspects another employee , Rob Roberts , of committing the murder . Rob , who is actually a mutant human who wears a disguise to hide his true physical body , subsists on brains in order to survive . When Sylvia is trailed by a private investigator ( Steve Kiziak ) , Rob kills him and eats in order to placate his hunger , which begins to get more and more uncontrollable . 
 Spinks visits Rob at his home the following day , annoyed at being fired from Lucky Boy for lying about his criminal record . He confronts Rob with evidence of his role in Pankow 's murder - Rob 's diet pills ( to control his voracious hunger ) with a <unk> <unk> on the lid - and attempts to blackmail him . Later that day , Rob intrudes Spinks ' residence to retrieve his pills , but hides in a closet when Spinks returns ; noticing that someone is in his home , Spinks arms himself with a baseball bat . He discovers Rob is in his home after seeing a pill bottle ( belonging to Spinks ) on the ground and tells him that he 's going to turn him in instead of blackmailing him . As Spinks heads to the closet , Rob takes off his disguise , opens the closet door , and reveals his true self to a stunned Spinks before killing him . Rob later meets with Dr. Mindy Rinehart , a counselor hired by Lucky Boy to consult the employees following Pankow 's killing . In session with her , Rob admits that he is battling an " eating disorder . " Rinehart sends him to an <unk> Anonymous meeting , not fully understanding Rob 's true nature . 
 Before attending the OA meeting , Rob is visited by Mulder and Scully , both who inform him that Spinks has disappeared ; Mulder then reveals about Pankow 's missing brain and that a " tiny shark 's tooth " was discovered by Scully embedded in the skull . Mulder deduces that a " genetic freak " is responsible , which Rob nervously laughs it off . After the agents leave , Rob attends the OA meeting . At the meeting , he sees his kind landlady , Sylvia <unk> . Although he does not respond well to the meeting ( by discreetly detailing the taste of a brain as " salty " , " juicy " , and " buttery " and especially visualizing a pulsing brain when a man turned to Sylvia ) , Rob and Sylvia bond on the trip home . Unfortunately , his hunger is far too overpowering and he is reluctantly compelled to feed upon her . To cover up her murder , Rob disposes of her body and smashes up his own apartment with Spinks ' baseball bat . He tells Mulder and Scully that Spinks showed up and accused him of being the killer . Mulder then tells Rob if he recognizes Kiziak , the private investigator , but Rob says no . Both agents leave to find Sylvia . 
 Rinehart shows up to find Rob packing his things , intent on leaving town .

 When Vince Gilligan wrote " Hungry , " he wanted to try a " different " approach to The X @-@ Files . Accordingly , he decided to write an episode that featured Mulder and Scully as the antagonists , as viewed through the eyes of the monster . Series creator Chris Carter applauded this idea and called it a " really great monster show . " Gilligan 's intention was for the monster to resonate with the audience . He wrote the part specifically so that the monster would be relatable . He later said , " My intention [ … ] was that at the end , when Mulder and Scully show up and kill the monster , to have the audience out there hoping that they would not show up . " 
 Chad Donella was cast as the lead monster because he possessed a " subtle , interesting quality , " according to casting director Rick Millikan . Director Kim Manners latter described Donella as a " great little actor . " Duchovny 's stunt double , Steve Kiziak played the role of the private detective — also called Steve Kiziak — that Roberts kills and eats . Kiziak later said , " It was a lot of fun to be in front of the camera . " Kiziak had first appeared as Duchovny 's body double in the third season episode " 2Shy , " and would later appear as a Mulder lookalike in " Fight Club . "

 As both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were filming movies , Return to Me and The House of Mirth respectively , the production company decided to film " Hungry " before any of the other episodes , despite the fact that it would be aired third , after " The Sixth Extinction " arc . This allowed Duchovny and Anderson to film their scenes and complete their movies with relatively little hassle . Several of the finished scenes show Mulder and Scully together , but many of these scenes were created with stand @-@ ins and doubles because of the stars ' busy schedules . Duchovny and Anderson were only available for two combined days of filming for this episode . 
 When it came time to design the sets , the production team found the Lucky Boy Burger restaurant to be relatively easy to create . Originally , the name of the restaurant was supposed to be <unk> , but the restaurant location that was considered ideal had a " Lucky Boy " sign that could not be removed . Later , the design department faced a challenge in creating Roberts ' apartment , because the script didn 't give a detailed account of what it was to look like .

 " Hungry " first aired in the United States on November 21 , 1999 . This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9 @.@ 6 , with a 14 share , meaning that roughly 9 @.@ 6 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 14 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . It was viewed by 16 @.@ 17 million viewers . The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on April 2 , 2000 and received 0 @.@ 68 million viewers , making it the seventh most watched episode that week . Fox promoted the episode with the tagline " Taste the terror tonight ! " 
 The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode five stars out of five , calling the premise " Dexter a decade early . " The two concluded that " the sympathy that Donella gives Rob as he shows his true colours is very touching . [ ... ] The final moments [ of the episode ] are a typically smart touch to this neglected gem of a story . " Paul Goebel of TV Squad listed Rob Roberts among his favorite X @-@ Files monsters . Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that the episode features a " great setup , but the climax leaves the usual open @-@ ended questions . " Zack Handlen on The A.V. Club called the episode " perfectly acceptable " and awarded it a " B + " . He was pleased with the episode 's unique format , calling it a " good gimmick " that made an otherwise " forgettable at best " episode — had it been constructed in the typical fashion of The X @-@ Files — into a memorable one . He was also positive towards the episode 's use of humor , noting that it " is very much on target " . Handlen , however , felt that the story showed the series ' tiredness and did not possess much suspense to keep the watcher completely engaged . 
 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four . She noted that the episode " suffers from a syndrome that has afflicted a great many X @-@ Files episodes in recent seasons [ … ] the syndrome consists of the audience finding out early on who the guilty party is . " Vitaris , however , did note that the episode 's " saving grace " was Vince Gilligan 's satiric writing tone ; she called the scene featuring Roberts hallucinating that the burgers he was frying were actually brains " sick , but hilarious " . Other reviews were more negative . Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode , noting that , although the change in perspective was unique and interesting , " this bit of originality does not rescue the episode from a familiarity bordering on the mundane . It 's not the first time we have seen genetic mutants who have an affinity for human body parts . " Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations , gave the episode a relatively negative review . Despite noting that the episode wasn 't a " horrible " entry for The X @-@ Files , Kessenich was unhappy with the characterization of Rob Roberts as well as the fact that the killer was revealed very quickly . 
 = Abdul Karim ( the Munshi ) = 
 Hafiz Mohammed Abdul Karim CIE , CVO ( 1863 – 1909 ) ( Hindi : <unk> ़ <unk> ़ <unk> ् <unk> <unk> ् <unk> <unk> , Urdu : <unk> محمد عبد <unk> ) , known as " the Munshi " , was an Indian Muslim attendant of Queen Victoria . He served her during the final fifteen years of her reign , gaining her maternal affection over that time . 
 Karim was born near Jhansi in British India , the son of a hospital assistant . In 1887 , Victoria 's Golden Jubilee year , Karim was one of two Indians selected to become servants to the Queen . Victoria came to like him a great deal and gave him the title of " Munshi " , an Urdu word often translated as " clerk " or " teacher " . Victoria appointed him her Indian Secretary , showered him with honours , and obtained a land grant for him in India . 
 The close platonic relationship between Karim and the Queen led to friction within the Royal Household , the other members of which felt themselves to be superior to him . The Queen insisted on taking Karim with her on her travels , which caused arguments between her and her other attendants . Following Victoria 's death in 1901 , her successor , Edward VII , returned Karim to India and ordered the confiscation and destruction of the Munshi 's correspondence with Victoria . Karim subsequently lived quietly near Agra , on the estate that Victoria had arranged for him , until his death at the age of 46 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Karim was born into a Muslim family at Lalitpur near Jhansi in 1863 . His father , Haji Mohammed Waziruddin , was a hospital assistant stationed with the Central India Horse , a British cavalry regiment . Karim had one older brother , Abdul Aziz , and four younger sisters . He was taught Persian and Urdu privately , and as a teenager travelled across North India and into Afghanistan . Karim 's father participated in the conclusive march to Kandahar , which ended the Second Anglo @-@ Afghan War , in August 1880 . After the war , Karim 's father transferred from the Central India Horse to a civilian position at the Central Jail in Agra , while Karim worked as a <unk> ( " agent " or " representative " ) for the Nawab of <unk> in the Agency of Agar . After three years in Agar , Karim resigned and moved to Agra , to become a vernacular clerk at the jail . His father arranged a marriage between Karim and the sister of a fellow worker . 
 Prisoners in the Agra jail were trained and kept employed as carpet weavers as part of their rehabilitation . In 1886 , 34 convicts travelled to London to demonstrate carpet weaving at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in South Kensington . Karim did not accompany the prisoners , but assisted Jail Superintendent John Tyler in organising the trip , and helped to select the carpets and weavers . When Queen Victoria visited the exhibition , Tyler gave her a gift of two gold bracelets , again chosen with the assistance of Karim . The Queen had a longstanding interest in her Indian territories and wished to employ some Indian servants for her Golden Jubilee . She asked Tyler to recruit two attendants who would be employed for a year . Karim was hastily coached in British manners and in the English language and sent to England , along with Mohammed Buksh . Major @-@ General Thomas Dennehy , who was about to be appointed to the Royal Household , had previously employed Buksh as a servant . It was planned that the two Indian men would initially wait at table , and learn to do other tasks . 
 = = Royal servant = = 
 After a journey by rail from Agra to Bombay and by mail steamer to Britain , Karim and Buksh arrived at Windsor Castle in June 1887 . They were put under the charge of Major @-@ General Dennehy and first served the Queen at breakfast in Frogmore House at Windsor on 23 June 1887 . The Queen described Karim in her diary for that day : " The other , much younger , is much lighter [ than Buksh ] , tall , and with a fine serious countenance . His father is a native doctor at Agra . They both kissed my feet . " 
 Five days later , the Queen noted that " The Indians always wait now and do so , so well and quietly . " On 3 August , she wrote : " I am learning a few words of Hindustani to speak to my servants . It is a great interest to me for both the language and the people , I have naturally never come into real contact with before . " On 20 August she had some " excellent curry " made by one of the servants . By 30 August Karim was teaching her Urdu , which she used during an audience in December to greet the Maharani <unk> of Baroda . 
 Victoria took a great liking to Karim and ordered that he was to be given additional tuition in the English language . By February 1888 he had " learnt English wonderfully " according to Victoria . After he complained to the Queen that he had been a clerk in India and thus menial work as a waiter was beneath him , he was promoted to the position of " Munshi " in August 1888 . In her journal , the Queen writes that she made this change so that he would stay : " I particularly wish to retain his services as he helps me in studying Hindustani , which interests me very much , & he is very intelligent & useful . " Photographs of him waiting at table were destroyed and he became the first personal Indian clerk to the Queen . Buksh remained in the Queen 's service , but only as a <unk> or table servant , until his death at Windsor in 1899 . 
 According to Karim biographer Sushila Anand , the Queen 's own letters testify that " her discussions with the Munshi were wide @-@ ranging — philosophical , political and practical . Both head and heart were engaged . There is no doubt that the Queen found in Abdul Karim a connection with a world that was fascinatingly alien , and a confidant who would not feed her the official line . " Karim was placed in charge of the other Indian servants and made responsible for their accounts . Victoria praised him in her letters and journal . " I am so very fond of him " she wrote , " He is so good & gentle & understanding all I want & is a real comfort to me . " She admired " her personal Indian clerk & Munshi , who is an excellent , clever , truly p [ i ] ous & very refined gentle man , who says , ' God ordered it ' ... God 's Orders is what they implicitly obey ! Such faith as theirs & such conscientiousness set us a <unk> example . " At Balmoral Castle , the Queen 's Scottish estate , Karim was allocated the room previously occupied by John Brown , a favourite servant of the Queen 's who had died in 1883 . Despite the serious and dignified manner that Karim presented to the outside world , the Queen wrote that " he is very friendly and cheerful with the Queen 's maids and laughs and even jokes now — and invited them to come and see all his fine things offering them fruit cake to eat " . 
 = = Household hostility = = 
 In November 1888 , Karim was given four months ' leave to return to India , during which time he visited his father . Karim wrote to Victoria that his father , who was due to retire , had hopes of a pension and that his former employer , John Tyler , was angling for promotion . As a result , throughout the first six months of 1889 , Victoria wrote to the Viceroy of India , Lord Lansdowne , demanding action on Waziruddin 's pension and Tyler 's promotion . The Viceroy was reluctant to pursue the issues because Waziruddin had told the local governor , Sir Auckland Colvin , that he desired only gratitude and also because Tyler had a reputation for tactless behaviour and bad @-@ tempered remarks . 
 Karim 's swift rise began to create jealousy and discontent among the members of the Royal Household , who would normally never mingle socially with Indians below the rank of prince . The Queen expected them to welcome Karim , an Indian of ordinary origin , into their midst ; they were not willing to do so . Karim , for his part , expected to be treated as an equal . When Albert Edward , Prince of Wales ( later Edward VII ) , hosted an entertainment for the Queen at his home in Sandringham on 26 April 1889 , Karim found he had been allocated a seat with the servants . Feeling insulted , he retired to his room . The Queen took his part , stating that he should have been seated among the Household . When the Queen attended the Braemar Games in 1890 , her son Prince Arthur , Duke of Connaught and Strathearn , approached the Queen 's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby in outrage after he saw the Munshi among the gentry . Ponsonby suggested that as it was " by the Queen 's order " , the Duke should approach the Queen about it . " This entirely shut him up " , noted Ponsonby . 
 Victoria biographer <unk> Erickson described the situation : 
 The rapid advancement and personal arrogance of the Munshi would inevitably have led to his unpopularity , but the fact of his race made all emotions run hotter against him . <unk> was a scourge of the age ; it went hand in hand with belief in the appropriateness of Britain 's global dominion . For a dark @-@ skinned Indian to be put very nearly on a level with the queen 's white servants was all but intolerable , for him to eat at the same table as them , to share in their daily lives was viewed as an outrage . Yet the queen was determined to impose harmony on her household . Race hatred was intolerable to her , and the " dear good Munshi " deserving of nothing but respect . 
 When complaints were brought to her , Victoria refused to believe any negative comments about Karim . She dismissed concerns about his behaviour , deemed high @-@ handed by Household and staff , as " very wrong " . In June 1889 , Karim 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , <unk> Ali , sold one of Victoria 's brooches to a jeweller in Windsor . She accepted Karim 's explanation that Ali had found the brooch and that it was customary in India to keep anything that one found , whereas the rest of the Household thought Ali had stolen it . In July , Karim was assigned the room previously occupied by Dr ( later Sir ) James Reid , Victoria 's physician , and given the use of a private sitting room . 
 The Queen , influenced by the Munshi , continued to write to Lord Lansdowne on the issue of Tyler 's promotion and the administration of India . She expressed reservations on the introduction of elected councils on the basis that Muslims would not win many seats because they were in the minority , and urged that Hindu feasts be re @-@ scheduled so as not to conflict with Muslim ones . Lansdowne dismissed the latter suggestion as potentially divisive , but appointed Tyler Acting Inspector General of Prisons in September 1889 . 
 To the Household 's surprise and concern , during Victoria 's stay at Balmoral in September 1889 , she and Karim stayed for one night at a remote house on the estate , <unk> Shiel at Loch <unk> . Victoria had often been there with Brown and after his death had sworn never to stay there again . In early 1890 , Karim fell ill with an inflamed boil on his neck and Victoria instructed Reid , her physician , to attend to Karim . She wrote to Reid expressing her anxiety and explaining that she felt responsible for the welfare of her Indian servants because they were so far from their own land . Reid performed an operation to open and drain the swelling , after which Karim recovered . Reid wrote on 1 March 1890 that the Queen was " visiting Abdul twice daily , in his room taking Hindustani lessons , signing her boxes , examining his neck , smoothing his pillows , etc . " 
 = = Land grant and family matters = = 
 In 1890 , the Queen had Karim 's portrait painted by Heinrich von Angeli . According to the Queen , von Angeli was keen to paint Karim as he had never painted an Indian before and " was so struck with his handsome face and colouring " . On 11 July 1890 , she wrote to Lansdowne , and the Secretary of State for India Lord Cross , for " a grant of land to her really exemplary and excellent young Munshi , Hafiz Abdul Karim " . The ageing Queen did not trust her relatives and the Royal Household to look after the Munshi after she was gone , and so sought to secure his future . Lansdowne replied that grants of land were given only to soldiers , and then only in cases of long and meritorious service . Nevertheless , the Viceroy agreed to find a grant for Karim that would provide about 600 rupees annually , the same amount that an old soldier could expect after performing exceptionally . Victoria wrote to Lansdowne repeatedly between July and October , pressuring him on the land grant . Apart from wasteland , there was little government @-@ controlled land near Agra ; thus Lansdowne was having trouble finding a suitable plot . On 30 October , the Munshi left Balmoral for four months ' leave in India , travelling on the same ship as Lady Lansdowne . On the same day , Lord Lansdowne telegraphed the Queen to let her know that a grant of land in the suburbs of Agra had been arranged . Lansdowne made a point of informing the Queen : 
 ... quite recently one of the men who at the peril of his life , and under a withering fire helped to blow up the Kashmiri Gate of Delhi in the Mutiny , received , on his retirement from the service , a grant of land yielding only Rs 250 for life . Abdul Karim , at the age of 26 , had received a perpetual grant of land representing an income of more than double that amount in recognition of his services as a member of your Majesty 's Household . 
 Lansdowne visited Agra in November 1890 . He and the Munshi met , and Lansdowne arranged for Karim to be seated with the viceregal staff during a durbar . Lansdowne met both the Munshi and Waziruddin privately , and Lady Lansdowne met his wife and mother @-@ in @-@ law , who were smuggled into the Viceroy 's camp in secrecy to comply with rules of purdah . 
 In 1891 , after Karim 's return to Britain , he asked Reid to send his father a large quantity of medicinal compounds , which included strychnine , chloral hydrate , morphine , and many other poisons . Reid calculated that the amount requested was " amply sufficient to kill 12 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 full grown men or an enormously large number of children " and consequently refused . Instead , Reid persuaded the Queen that the chemicals should be obtained at her expense by the appropriate authorities in India . In June 1892 , Waziruddin visited Britain and stayed at both Balmoral and Windsor Castles . He retired in 1893 and in the New Year Honours 1894 he was rewarded , to Victoria 's satisfaction , with the title of Khan Bahadur , which Lansdowne noted was " one which under ordinary circumstances the Doctor [ could ] not have ventured to expect " . 
 In May 1892 , the Munshi returned to India on six months ' leave ; on his return , his wife and mother @-@ in @-@ law accompanied him . Both women were shrouded from head to foot and travelled in railway compartments with drawn curtains . Victoria wrote , " the two Indian ladies ... who are , I believe , the first Mohammedan purdah ladies who ever came over ... keep their custom of complete seclusion and of being entirely covered when they go out , except for the holes for their eyes . " As a woman , Victoria saw them without veils . The Munshi and his family were housed in cottages at Windsor , Balmoral and Osborne , the Queen 's retreat on the Isle of Wight . Victoria visited regularly , usually bringing her female guests , including the Empress of Russia and the Princess of Wales , to meet the Munshi 's female relatives . One visitor , Marie Mallet , the Queen 's maid @-@ in @-@ waiting and wife of civil servant Bernard Mallet , recorded : 
 I have just been to see the Munshi 's wife ( by Royal Command ) . She is fat and not <unk> , a delicate shade of chocolate and gorgeously attired , rings on her fingers , rings on her nose , a pocket mirror set in <unk> on her thumb and every feasible part of her person hung with chains and bracelets and ear @-@ rings , a rose @-@ pink veil on her head bordered with heavy gold and splendid silk and satin <unk> round her person . She speaks English in a limited manner ... " 
 Dr Reid never saw Mrs Karim unveiled , though he claimed that whenever he was called to examine her , a different tongue was protruded from behind the veil for his inspection . 
 In 1892 , the Munshi 's name began to appear in the Court Circular among the names of officials accompanying the Queen on her annual March trip to the French Riviera . As usual , Victoria spent Christmas 1892 at Osborne House , where the Munshi , as he had in previous years , participated in tableaux vivants arranged as entertainment . The following year , during Victoria 's annual holiday in continental Europe , he was presented to King Umberto I of Italy . In the words of a contemporary newspaper account , " The King did not understand why this magnificent and imposing Hindoo should have been formally presented to him . The popular idea in Italy is that the Munshi is a captive Indian prince , who is taken about by the Queen as an outward and visible sign of Her Majesty 's supremacy in the East . " 
 By 1893 , Victoria was sending notes to Karim signed in Urdu . She often signed off her letters to Karim as " your affectionate mother , VRI " or " your truly devoted and fond loving mother , VRI " . 
 = = Travels and Diamond Jubilee = = 
 The Munshi was perceived to have taken advantage of his position as the Queen 's favourite , and to have risen above his status as a menial clerk , causing resentment in the court . On a journey through Italy , he published an advertisement in the Florence Gazette stating that " [ h ] e is belonging to a good and highly respectful <unk> [ sic ] " . Karim refused to travel with the other Indians and appropriated the maid 's bathroom for his exclusive use . On a visit to Coburg , he refused to attend the marriage of Victoria 's granddaughter Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha , because her father , Victoria 's son Alfred , Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha , assigned him a seat in the gallery with the servants . Confronted by the opposition of her family and retainers , the Queen defended her favourite . She wrote to her private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby : " to make out that the poor good Munshi is so low is really outrageous & in a country like England quite out of place ... She has known 2 Archbishops who were sons respectively of a Butcher & a Grocer ... Abdul 's father saw good & honourable service as a Dr & he [ Karim ] feels cut to the heart at being thus spoken of . " 
 Lord Lansdowne 's term of office ended in 1894 , and he was replaced by Lord Elgin . Ponsonby 's son Frederick was Elgin 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp in India for a short time before being appointed an equerry to Victoria . Victoria asked Frederick to visit Waziruddin , the " surgeon @-@ general " at Agra . On his return to Britain , Frederick told Victoria that Waziruddin " was not the surgeon @-@ general but only the apothecary at the jail " , which Victoria " stoutly denied " saying Frederick " must have seen the wrong man " . To " mark her displeasure " , Victoria did not invite Frederick to dinner for a year . 
 At Christmas 1894 , the Munshi sent Lord Elgin a sentimental greetings card , which to Victoria 's dismay went unacknowledged . Through Frederick Ponsonby , she complained to Elgin , who replied that he did " not imagine that any acknowledgement was necessary , or that the Queen would expect him to send one " , pointing out " how impossible it would be for an Indian Viceroy to enter into correspondence of this kind " . 
 Frederick wrote to Elgin in January 1895 that Karim was deeply unpopular in the Household , and that he occupied " very much the same position as John Brown used to " . Princesses Louise and Beatrice , Prince Henry of Battenberg , Prime Minister Lord Rosebery , and Secretary of State for India Henry Fowler had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen , who " refused to listen to what they had to say but was very angry , so as you see the Munshi is a sort of pet , like a dog or cat which the Queen will not willingly give up " . Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the India Office that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read , and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a confidential nature . Victoria 's advisors feared Karim 's association with Rafiuddin Ahmed , an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League . They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan , Abdur Rahman Khan . There is no indication that these fears were well @-@ founded , or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet . 
 During the Queen 's annual holiday in the French Riviera , in March 1895 , the local newspapers ran articles on Le <unk> , <unk> <unk> and le professor de la Reine , which according to Frederick Ponsonby were instigated by Karim . In the Queen 's 1895 Birthday Honours that May , Karim was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire ( CIE ) , despite the opposition of both Rosebery and Fowler . Tyler was astonished by Karim 's elevation when he visited England the following month . 
 After the United Kingdom general election , 1895 , Rosebery and Fowler were replaced by Lord Salisbury and Lord George Hamilton respectively . Hamilton thought Karim was not as dangerous as some supposed but that he was " a stupid man , and on that account he may become a tool in the hands of other men . " In early 1896 , Karim returned to India on six months ' leave , and Hamilton and Elgin placed him under " unobtrusive " surveillance . They dared not be too obvious lest the Munshi notice and complain to the Queen . Despite fears that Karim might meet with hostile agents , his visit home appears to have been uneventful . 
 He left Bombay for Britain in August 1896 , bringing with him his young nephew , Mohammed Abdul Rashid . Karim had no children of his own . Victoria had arranged for a female doctor to examine the Munshi 's wife in December 1893 , as the couple had been trying to conceive without success . By 1897 , according to Reid , Karim had gonorrhea . 
 In March 1897 as members of the Household prepared to depart for Cimiez for the Queen 's annual visit , they insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party , and decided to resign if he did so . When Harriet Phipps , one of the Queen 's maids of honour , informed her of the collective decision , the Queen swept the contents of her desk onto the floor in a fury . The Household backed down , but the holiday was marred by increased resentment and rows between the Household and Victoria . She thought their distrust and dislike of Karim was motivated by " race prejudice " and jealousy . When Rafiuddin Ahmed joined Karim in Cimiez , the Household forced him to leave , which Victoria thought " disgraceful " , and she asked the prime minister to issue an apology to Ahmed , explaining he was only excluded because he had written articles in newspapers and pressmen were not permitted . Ponsonby wrote in late April , " [ the Munshi ] happens to be a thoroughly stupid and uneducated man , and his one idea in life seems to be to do nothing and to eat as much as he can . " Reid warned the Queen that her attachment to Karim had led to questions about her sanity , and Hamilton telegraphed to Elgin requesting information on the Munshi and his family in an effort to discredit him . On receiving Elgin 's reply that they were " Respectable and trustworthy ... but position of family humble " , Hamilton concluded " the Munshi has done nothing to my knowledge which is reprehensible or deserving of official stricture ... enquiries wd not be right , unless they were in connection with some definite statement or accusation . " He did , however , authorise further investigation of the " <unk> intriguer named Rafiuddin " . Nothing was ever proven against Ahmed , who later became a Bombay government official and was knighted in 1932 . The effect of the row , in Hamilton 's words , was " to put him [ the Munshi ] more into his humble place , and his influence will not be the same in the future " . 
 After the distress of 1897 , Victoria sought to reassure the Munshi . " I have in my <unk> arrangements secured your comfort , " she wrote to him , " and have constantly thought of you well . The long letter I enclose which was written nearly a month ago is entirely and solely my own idea , not a human being will ever know of it or what you answer me . If you can 't read it I will help you and then burn it at once . " She told Reid the squabbles placed her and the Munshi under strain , which he replied was unlikely in the latter 's case " judging from his robust appearance and undiminished <unk> " . Lord Salisbury told Reid he thought it unlikely in her case too , and that she secretly enjoyed the arguments because they were " the only form of excitement she can have " . 
 Reid seems to have joined with the other Household members in complaining about the Munshi , for the Queen wrote to him , " I thought you stood between me and them , but now I feel that you chime in with the rest . " In 1899 , members of the Household again insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party when the Queen took her annual holiday at Cimiez . The Queen duly had Karim remain at Windsor , then when the party had settled into the Excelsior Regina hotel , wired Karim to come and join them .

 In late 1898 Karim 's purchase of a parcel of land adjacent to his earlier grant was finalised ; he had become a wealthy man . Reid claimed in his diary that he had challenged Karim over his financial dealings : " You have told the Queen that in India no receipts are given for money , and therefore you ought not to give any to Sir F Edwards [ Keeper of the Privy Purse ] . This is a lie and means that you wish to cheat the Queen . " The Munshi told the Queen he would provide receipts in answer to the allegations , and Victoria wrote to Reid dismissing the accusations , calling them " shameful " . 
 Karim asked Victoria for the title of " Nawab " , the Indian equivalent of a peer , and to appoint him a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire ( KCIE ) , which would make him " Sir Abdul Karim " . A horrified Elgin suggested instead that she make Karim a Member of the Royal Victorian Order ( MVO ) , which was in her personal gift , bestowed no title , and would have little political implication in India . Privy Purse Sir Fleetwood Edwards and Prime Minister Lord Salisbury advised against even the lower honour . Nevertheless in 1899 , on the occasion of her 80th birthday , Victoria appointed Karim a commander of the order ( CVO ) , a rank intermediate between member and knight . 
 The Munshi returned to India in November 1899 for a year . Waziruddin , described as " a courtly old gentleman " by Lord Curzon , Elgin 's replacement as Viceroy , died in June 1900 . By the time Karim returned to Britain in November 1900 Victoria had visibly aged , and her health was failing . Within three months she was dead . 
 After Victoria 's death , her son , Edward VII , dismissed the Munshi and his relations from court and had them sent back to India . However , Edward did allow the Munshi to be the last to view Victoria 's body before her casket was closed , and to be part of her funeral procession . Almost all of the correspondence between Victoria and Karim was burned on Edward 's orders . Lady Curzon wrote on 9 August 1901 @,@ 
 Charlotte Knollys told me that the Munshi bogie which had frightened all the household at Windsor for many years had proved a ridiculous farce , as the poor man had not only given up all his letters but even the photos signed by Queen and had returned to India like a whipped hound . All the Indian servants have gone back so now there is no Oriental picture & queerness at Court . 
 In 1905 – 06 , George , Prince of Wales , visited India and wrote to the King from Agra , " In the evening we saw the Munshi . He has not grown more beautiful and is getting fat . I must say he was most civil and humble and really pleased to see us . He wore his <unk> which I had no idea he had got . I am told he lives quietly here and gives no trouble at all . " 
 The Munshi died at his home , Karim Lodge , on his estate in Agra in 1909 . He was survived by two wives , and was interred in a pagoda @-@ like mausoleum in the <unk> <unk> cemetery in Agra beside his father . 
 On the instructions of Edward VII , the Commissioner of Agra , W. H. Cobb , visited Karim Lodge to retrieve any remaining correspondence between the Munshi and the Queen or her Household , which was confiscated and sent to the King . The Viceroy ( by then Lord Minto ) , Lieutenant @-@ Governor John Hewitt , and India Office civil servants disapproved of the seizure , and recommended that the letters be returned . Eventually the King returned four , on condition that they would be sent back to him on the death of the Munshi 's first wife .

 As the Munshi had had no children , his nephews and <unk> inherited his wealth and properties . The Munshi 's family continued to reside in Agra until Indian independence and the partition of India in August 1947 , after which they emigrated to Pakistan . The estate , including Karim Lodge , was confiscated by the Indian government and distributed among Hindu refugees from Pakistan . Half of Karim Lodge was subsequently divided into two individual residences , with the remaining half becoming a nursing home and doctor 's office . 
 Until the publication of Frederick Ponsonby 's memoirs in 1951 , there was little biographical material on the Munshi . Scholarly examination of his life and relationship with Victoria began around the 1960s , focusing on the Munshi as " an illustration of race and class prejudice in Victorian England " . Mary Lutyens , in editing the diary of her grandmother Edith ( wife of Lord Lytton , Viceroy of India 1876 – 80 ) , concluded , " Though one can understand that the Munshi was disliked , as favourites nearly always are ... One cannot help feeling that the repugnance with which he was regarded by the Household was based mostly on snobbery and colour prejudice . " Elizabeth Longford wrote , " Abdul Karim stirred once more that same royal imagination which had magnified the virtues of John Brown ... Nevertheless , [ it ] insinuated into her confidence an inferior person , while it increased the nation 's dizzy infatuation with an inferior dream , the dream of Colonial Empire . " 
 Historians agree with the suspicions of her Household that the Munshi influenced the Queen 's opinions on Indian issues , biasing her against Hindus and favouring Muslims . But suspicions that he passed secrets to Rafiuddin Ahmed are discounted . Victoria asserted that " no political papers of any kind are ever in the Munshi 's hands , even in her presence . He only helps her to read words which she cannot read or merely ordinary submissions on warrants for signature . He does not read English fluently enough to be able to read anything of importance . " Consequently , it is thought unlikely that he could have influenced the government 's Indian policy or provided useful information to Muslim activists . 
 = Incapillo = 
 Incapillo is a Pleistocene caldera , a depression formed by the collapse of a volcano , in the La Rioja province of Argentina . Part of the Argentine Andes , it is considered the southernmost volcanic centre in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes with Pleistocene activity . Incapillo is one of several ignimbritic or <unk> systems that , along with 44 active stratovolcanoes , are part of the Central Volcanic Zone . 
 Subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America plate is responsible for most of the volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone . After activity in the western Maricunga Belt volcanic arc ceased six million years ago , volcanism started up in the Incapillo region , forming the high volcanoes Monte Pissis , Cerro Bonete Chico and Sierra de Veladero . Later , a number of lava domes formed between these volcanoes . 
 Incapillo is the source of the Incapillo ignimbrite , a medium @-@ sized deposit comparable to the Katmai ignimbrite . With a volume of about 20 @.@ 4 cubic kilometres ( 4 @.@ 9 cu mi ) , the Incapillo ignimbrite was erupted 0 @.@ 52 ± 0 @.@ 03 and 0 @.@ 51 ± 0 @.@ 04 million years ago . A caldera with dimensions of 5 by 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi × 3 @.@ 7 mi ) was formed during the eruption . Later volcanism generated more lava domes within the caldera and a debris flow in the Sierra de Veladero . The lake within the caldera may overlie an area of ongoing hydrothermal activity . 
 = = Geography and structure = = 
 Incapillo is located in Argentina 's La Rioja province . The name " Incapillo " means " Crown of the Inca " in Quechua and is the highest caldera stemming from explosive activity in the world . It is also known as Bonete caldera . 
 Incapillo is part of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone , which extends through the countries of Chile , Bolivia , and Argentina and includes six or more Quaternary caldera or ignimbrite systems , about 44 stratovolcanoes , and over 18 smaller centres . One of these stratovolcanoes , Ojos del Salado , is the world 's highest volcano . This zone also includes the Altiplano @-@ Puna volcanic complex and the Galan caldera farther south . Incapillo is the southernmost volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone with Pleistocene activity ; the next such volcano to the south is <unk> in the Southern Volcanic Zone at 33 ° southern latitude . 
 Incapillo is a caldera with a diameter of 5 by 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi × 3 @.@ 7 mi ) at an elevation of 5 @,@ 750 metres ( 18 @,@ 860 ft ) . The three adjacent volcanic centres of Monte Pissis ( 6 @,@ 882 metres ( 22 @,@ 579 ft ) ) , Cerro Bonete Grande ( 6 @,@ 436 metres ( 21 @,@ 115 ft ) ) , and Cerro Bonete Chico ( 6 @,@ 759 metres ( 22 @,@ 175 ft ) ) are also considered part of this volcanic complex and are among the highest on Earth . These centres surround the ignimbrite and lava domes . The walls of the caldera are 250 metres ( 820 ft ) high . A uniform ignimbrite , called the Incapillo ignimbrite , is rich in pumice and forms the bulk of the caldera walls . 
 Around the caldera lie 40 lava domes , which extend northwest @-@ southeast . There is an eastern group between Monte Pissis and Cerro Bonete Chico and a western one on the Sierra de Veladero . Overall , the domes have heights of 100 – 600 metres ( 330 – 1 @,@ 970 ft ) and a basal apron of about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) width of erosional material . Some domes have water @-@ filled craters with widths of 20 metres ( 66 ft ) at their top . Domes on the caldera 's northern side are dacitic and show signs of alteration . Some domes are probably part of the pre @-@ caldera complex , and several rhyodacitic domes were modified by erosional processes after caldera formation ; these were formerly considered erosional remnants . Older domes have reddish oxidized colours in satellite images . The total volume of the domes is about 16 cubic kilometres ( 3 @.@ 8 cu mi ) . 
 Next to a heavily hydrothermally altered lava dome in the centre of the caldera lies the Laguna Corona del Inca . This 350 metres ( 1 @,@ 150 ft ) deep and 5 @,@ 300 metres ( 17 @,@ 400 ft ) high lake measures 2 by 1 kilometre ( 1 @.@ 24 mi × 0 @.@ 62 mi ) . The lake has probably generated the evaporite and lacustrine deposits that lie on the caldera floor . Water temperatures of 13 ° C ( 55 ° F ) obtained by satellite measurements suggest that some hydrothermal activity persists . The lake is fed by meltwater . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The Nazca plate subducts beneath the South America plate at a speed of 7 – 9 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) per year in the area of the Central Volcanic Zone . The subduction results in volcanism along the occidental Cordillera 240 – 300 kilometres ( 150 – 190 mi ) east of the trench formed by the subduction . 
 Incapillo is one of at least six different ignimbrite or caldera volcanoes that are part of the Central Volcanic Zone , in Chile , Bolivia and Argentina . The Central Volcanic Zone is one of four different volcanic arcs in the Andes . About 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) west of Incapillo lies the Maricunga Belt , where volcanism started 27 mya and involved phases of ignimbritic and stratovolcanic activity , including <unk> volcano , until activity ceased with the last eruption of Nevado de <unk> 6 mya . South of Incapillo , the Pampean flat slab region is associated with tectonic deformation and lack of volcanic activity until <unk> volcano farther south . 
 S. L. de Silva and P. Francis suggested in their 1991 book Volcanoes of the Central Andes that the Central Volcanic Zone should be subdivided into two systems of volcanoes , one in Peru and another in Chile , on the basis of the orientation ( northwest – southeast versus north – south ) . C.A. Wood , G. McLaughlin and P. Francis in a 1987 paper at the American Geophysical Union suggested instead a subdivision into nine different groups . 
 = = = Local = = = 
 Incapillo is found on a crust 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) thick , among the thickest in volcanic regions of the Earth . Several studies by Suzanne <unk> Kay and others indicate that trends in the isotope ratios are because of a thickening crust and increased contribution thereof to the magmas . At the latitude of Incapillo , the northern <unk> terrane borders the <unk> terrane , both of which were attached to South America during the Ordovician but are of different provenance . 
 At the latitude of Incapillo , the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South America plate abruptly shallows towards the south . This <unk> forms the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic Zone and the <unk> inactive Pampean flat slab region farther south . This magmatic inactivity occurs because the flat slab removes the asthenospheric wedge . 
 Incapillo is part of a volcanic system active between 3 @.@ 5 and 2 mya that includes Ojos del Salado and Nevado Tres Cruces . It was the last volcanic centre formed in the region ; subsequently , the <unk> of the subducting slab prevented volcanism east and south of it . Another volcanic trend considers Incapillo as part of a northeast – southwest trend with Cerro Galan and Cerro Blanco . This trend may be related to delamination of the lower crust . Also , these centres are located between two domains of different rigidity , an Ordovician sedimentary domain of low rigidity and a higher rigidity basement . 
 The formation of the older lava domes may have been influenced by buried faults or the supply systems of the older Pissis and Bonete Chico volcanoes . Isotope and composition data suggest that the magma of Incapillo forms at relatively constrained depths of c . 65 – 70 kilometres ( 40 – 43 mi ) above the shallow slab . A focus of seismic activity is found at Incapillo . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 The Incapillo ignimbrite is formed by potassium @-@ rich and magnesium @-@ poor rhyodacite , forming glassy and porous pumice with individual clasts of 5 – 20 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 – 7 @.@ 9 in ) in diametre . Typical pumice contains crystals of biotite , hornblende , plagioclase , quartz , and sanidine , with minor amounts of apatite , iron oxides , and titanite . The lava domes have uniform crystalline compositions that are richer in magnesium than the ignimbrite . Within the lava dome rocks lie phenocrysts of amphibole , biotite , plagioclase , quartz , and titanite with some alkali feldspar in some domes . Older domes have higher amphibole and lower quartz content than younger domes . Post @-@ caldera domes are strongly hydrothermally altered . 
 Rocks from Incapillo are rich in sodium and have high ratios of lanthanum and samarium to ytterbium and high ratios of barium to lanthanum , as well as high lead @-@ 206 to lead @-@ 204 and strontium @-@ 87 / strontium @-@ 86 ratios . These rare earth element patterns are similar to the Late Miocene Maricunga Belt rocks and contrast to early Miocene rocks . The changes occurred at the same time as the arc migrated eastward , terminating activity in the Maricunga Belt . The element ratios are pronouncedly arc @-@ like with some <unk> signatures . The rocks contain considerably more sodium and alumina than almost all Central Andes siliceous volcanic rocks . 
 The composition of the lava domes suggests that they were formed by <unk> magma left behind by the caldera @-@ forming eruption . The pre @-@ caldera lava domes were generated either directly from a common magma chamber or indirectly through secondary chambers . The lead isotope ratios are consistent with the volcano having formed at the edge of an area of granite and rhyolite of Paleozoic age . Incapillo magmas probably formed as <unk> high @-@ pressure mafic magmas derived from the crust , either directly by <unk> or indirectly by dragged @-@ down crustal fragments . The magmas are then modified by crustal contamination and fractional crystallization . As the subducting slab <unk> , crustal garnet @-@ containing <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> , contributed both from the crustal basis and forearc rocks that were dragged down by the subducting slab , became an increasingly important component of erupted magmas . Eventually , the Incapillo magma chamber was disconnected from the mantle and lower crust . 
 The Incapillo ignimbrite contains xenoliths with sizes of 0 @.@ 5 – 4 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 20 – 1 @.@ 57 in ) formed by <unk> . <unk> crystals are enclosed in <unk> plagioclase crystals and sometimes contain secondary biotite crystals . <unk> is the dominant component . 
 = = Climate , hydrology and vegetation = = 
 Incapillo as a high altitude location has an alpine climate , with low temperatures and low oxygen , high winds and predominantly summer precipitation . Incapillo itself has no weather stations and thus climate data from there are not available , however Laguna Brava farther south has an average precipitation of 300 millimetres ( 12 in ) and temperatures of 0 – 5 ° C ( 32 – 41 ° F ) . The Desaguadero River originates on Bonete . 
 Vegetation varies depending on the water supply and altitude of the site , with an upper altitude limit of 4 @,@ 300 – 5 @,@ 000 metres ( 14 @,@ 100 – 16 @,@ 400 ft ) beneath of which the vegetation takes the form of a scrub steppe . Grasses at 5 @,@ 000 metres ( 16 @,@ 000 ft ) include Festuca , Stipa and in wetter areas also genera like Calamagrostis . Scrub like <unk> and <unk> <unk> occasionally form dense scrub patches .

 Activity at Incapillo commenced shortly after the end of the Maricunga Belt volcanism and occurred first at Monte Pissis between 6 @.@ 5 and 3 @.@ 5 mya . Later volcanism occurred south of Incapillo 4 @.@ 7 ± 0 @.@ 5 mya , at Sierra de Veladero 5 @.@ 6 ± 1 – 3 @.@ 6 ± 0 @.@ 5 mya , and in the region of Cerro Bonete Chico 5 @.@ 2 ± 0 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 5 ± 0 @.@ 1 mya . Some of the 3 – 2 mya Pircas Negras mafic andesites appear to be associated with the Incapillo volcanic complex . These rocks form the last pulse of the Pircas Negras volcanism . Specific ages of the Pircas Negras flows in the Incapillo region include 4 @.@ 7 ± 0 @.@ 5 mya , 3 @.@ 2 ± 0 @.@ 3 mya and 1 @.@ 9 ± 0 @.@ 2 mya .

The lava domes formed through non @-@ explosive extrusion . 
 The Incapillo ignimbrite is an <unk> ignimbrite that covers a surface area of 80 @.@ 47 square kilometres ( 31 @.@ 07 sq mi ) , extending to a distance of 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) from the caldera . The ignimbrite appears in an eastward @-@ heading ephemeral river valley and the southern Quebrada del Veladero , possibly also next to the Rio Salado headwaters . <unk> range from 250 to 10 metres ( 820 to 33 ft ) ; the ignimbrite is underlain by a lithic @-@ and @-@ ash rich surge deposit with a thickness of 5 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) . The ignimbrite displays banding features away from the caldera and in Quebrada de Veladero football @-@ sized clasts are mixed within fine ash . Rocks from the ignimbrites farther away from their source indicate the ignimbrite probably formed from the mixing of less viscous dacitic magma with rhyolite . The total volume of the ignimbrite is about 20 @.@ 4 cubic kilometres ( 4 @.@ 9 cu mi ) . Ages have been found of 0 @.@ 52 ± 0 @.@ 03 and 0 @.@ 51 ± 0 @.@ 04 mya ago . It is a rhyodacitic to rhyolitic ignimbrite with a high crystal and pumice and low lithic content . The dense rock equivalent volume is about 14 cubic kilometres ( 3 @.@ 4 cu mi ) . The volume of the Incapillo ignimbrite is comparable to that of the Katmai ignimbrite . The ignimbrite was probably formed from a low @-@ height fountaining eruption without a high eruption column , forming a base surge first and pyroclastic flows later . The change from lava dome to ignimbrite @-@ forming eruptions may have been triggered by the injection of hotter magmas into the magma chamber or less likely by changes in the tectonic context . During the eruption , a piston @-@ like collapse formed the caldera . 
 Later , a debris flow named Veladero ( also known as Quebrada de Veladero Ignimbrite ) occurred in a glacier valley south of the caldera . It is rich in lithics and pumice . These lithics are derived from Sierra de Veladero , Cerro Bonete Chico , and Pircas Negras lavas . The debris flow ranges from 15 to 25 metres ( 49 to 82 ft ) in thickness 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) south of the caldera to 10 to 15 metres ( 33 to 49 ft ) farther south , the total volume being 0 @.@ 7 – 0 @.@ 5 cubic kilometres ( 0 @.@ 17 – 0 @.@ 12 cu mi ) . The debris flow does have a different composition from the main Incapillo ignimbrite , as it contains red @-@ brown dacite and clasts . It has a massive ungraded composition and is likely a lahar or debris flow deposit , probably influenced by glacial or crater lake water . Wind @-@ driven effects have generated hummocky ridges . 
 There are no dates available for post @-@ caldera lava domes , which probably arose from magma ascending through the caldera forming conduits , seeing as these domes are found only inside the caldera . The elevated temperatures of the caldera lake suggest that hydrothermal activity still occurs beneath Incapillo . 
 = Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother = 
 Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes @-@ Lyon ( 4 August 1900 – 30 March 2002 ) was the wife of King George VI and the mother of Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret , Countess of Snowdon . She was Queen consort of the United Kingdom and the Dominions from her husband 's accession in 1936 until his death in 1952 , after which she was known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother , to avoid confusion with her daughter . She was the last Empress consort of India . 
 Born into a family of British nobility as The Honourable Elizabeth Bowes @-@ Lyon , she became Lady Elizabeth Bowes @-@ Lyon when her father inherited the Scottish Earldom of Strathmore and Kinghorne in 1904 . She came to prominence in 1923 when she married Albert , Duke of York , the second son of King George V and Queen Mary . The couple and their daughters embodied traditional ideas of family and public service . She undertook a variety of public engagements and became known as the " Smiling Duchess " because of her consistent public expression . 
 In 1936 , her husband unexpectedly became King when his brother , Edward VIII , abdicated in order to marry the American divorcée Wallis Simpson . Elizabeth became Queen . She accompanied her husband on diplomatic tours to France and North America before the start of World War II . During the war , her seemingly indomitable spirit provided moral support to the British public . In recognition of her role as an asset to British interests , Adolf Hitler described her as " the most dangerous woman in Europe " . After the war , her husband 's health deteriorated and she was widowed at the age of 51 . Her elder daughter , aged 25 , became the new Queen . 
 On the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and with the former King Edward VIII living abroad , Elizabeth became the senior member of the British Royal Family and assumed a position as family matriarch . In her later years , she was a consistently popular member of the family , even when other members were suffering from low levels of public approval . She continued an active public life until just a few months before her death at the age of 101 , seven weeks after the death of her younger daughter , Princess Margaret . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes @-@ Lyon was the youngest daughter and the ninth of ten children of Claude Bowes @-@ Lyon , Lord Glamis ( later the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the Peerage of Scotland ) , and his wife , Cecilia Cavendish @-@ Bentinck . Her mother was descended from British Prime Minister William Cavendish @-@ Bentinck , 3rd Duke of Portland , and Governor @-@ General of India Richard Wellesley , 1st Marquess Wellesley , who was the elder brother of another Prime Minister , Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington . 
 The location of her birth remains uncertain , but reputedly she was born either in her parents ' Westminster home at Belgrave Mansions , Grosvenor Gardens , or in a horse @-@ drawn ambulance on the way to a hospital . Other possible locations include Forbes House in Ham , London , the home of her maternal grandmother , Louisa Scott . Her birth was registered at Hitchin , Hertfordshire , near the Strathmores ' English country house , St Paul 's Walden Bury , which was also given as her birthplace in the census the following year . She was christened there on 23 September 1900 , in the local parish church , All Saints , and her godparents included her paternal aunt Lady Maud Bowes @-@ Lyon and cousin Venetia James . 
 She spent much of her childhood at St Paul 's Walden and at Glamis Castle , the Earl 's ancestral home in Scotland . She was educated at home by a governess until the age of eight , and was fond of field sports , ponies and dogs . When she started school in London , she astonished her teachers by precociously beginning an essay with two Greek words from Xenophon 's Anabasis . Her best subjects were literature and scripture . After returning to private education under a German Jewish governess , Käthe Kübler , she passed the Oxford Local Examination with distinction at age thirteen . 
 On her fourteenth birthday , Britain declared war on Germany . Four of her brothers served in the army . Her elder brother , Fergus , an officer in the Black Watch Regiment , was killed in action at the Battle of Loos in 1915 . Another brother , Michael , was reported missing in action on 28 April 1917 . Three weeks later , the family discovered he had been captured after being wounded . He remained in a prisoner of war camp for the rest of the war . Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers , which Elizabeth helped to run . She was particularly instrumental in organising the rescue of the castle 's contents during a serious fire on 16 September 1916 . One of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be " Hung , drawn , & quartered ... Hung in diamonds , drawn in a coach and four , and quartered in the best house in the land . " 
 = = Marriage to Prince Albert = = 
 Prince Albert , Duke of York – " Bertie " to the family – was the second son of King George V. He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921 , but she turned him down , being " afraid never , never again to be free to think , speak and act as I feel I really ought to " . When he declared he would marry no other , his mother , Queen Mary , visited Glamis to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son 's heart . She became convinced that Elizabeth was " the one girl who could make Bertie happy " , but nevertheless refused to interfere . At the same time , Elizabeth was courted by James Stuart , Albert 's equerry , until he left the Prince 's service for a better @-@ paid job in the American oil business . 
 In February 1922 , Elizabeth was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Albert 's sister , Princess Mary , to Viscount Lascelles . The following month , Albert proposed again , but she refused him once more . Eventually , in January 1923 , Elizabeth agreed to marry Albert , despite her misgivings about royal life . Albert 's freedom in choosing Elizabeth , not a member of a royal family , though the daughter of a peer , was considered a gesture in favour of political modernisation ; previously , princes were expected to marry princesses from other royal families . They selected a platinum engagement ring featuring a Kashmir sapphire with two diamonds adorning its sides . They married on 26 April 1923 , at Westminster Abbey . Unexpectedly , Elizabeth laid her bouquet at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior on her way into the Abbey , in memory of her brother Fergus . Elizabeth became styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York . Following a wedding breakfast at Buckingham Palace prepared by chef Gabriel <unk> , the new Duchess and her husband honeymooned at <unk> Lacey , a manor house in Surrey , and then went to Scotland , where she caught " unromantic " whooping cough .

 After a successful visit to Northern Ireland in July 1924 , the Labour government agreed that Albert and Elizabeth could tour East Africa from December 1924 to April 1925 . The Labour government was defeated by the Conservatives in a general election in November ( which Elizabeth described as " marvellous " to her mother ) and the Governor @-@ General of Anglo @-@ Egyptian Sudan , Sir Lee Stack , was assassinated three weeks later . Despite this , the tour went ahead , and they visited Aden , Kenya , Uganda , and Sudan , but Egypt was avoided because of political tensions . 
 Albert had a stammer , which affected his ability to deliver speeches , and after October 1925 , Elizabeth assisted in helping him through the therapy devised by Lionel Logue , an episode portrayed in the 2010 film The King 's Speech . In 1926 , the couple had their first child , Princess Elizabeth – " Lilibet " to the family – who would later become Queen Elizabeth II . Another daughter , Princess Margaret Rose , was born four years later . Albert and Elizabeth , without their child , travelled to Australia to open Parliament House in Canberra in 1927 . She was , in her own words , " very miserable at leaving the baby " . Their journey by sea took them via Jamaica , the Panama Canal and the Pacific ; Elizabeth fretted constantly over her baby back in Britain , but their journey was a public relations success . She charmed the public in Fiji when shaking hands with a long line of official guests , as a stray dog walked in on the ceremony and she shook its paw as well . In New Zealand she fell ill with a cold , and missed some engagements , but enjoyed the local fishing in the Bay of Islands accompanied by Australian sports fisherman Harry Andreas . On the return journey , via Mauritius , the Suez Canal , Malta and Gibraltar , their transport , HMS Renown , caught fire and they prepared to abandon ship before the fire was brought under control . 
 = = Accession and abdication of Edward VIII = = 
 On 20 January 1936 , King George V died and Albert 's brother , Edward , Prince of Wales , became King Edward VIII . George had expressed private reservations about his successor , saying , " I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne . " 
 Just months into his reign , Edward forced a constitutional crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Wallis Simpson . Although legally Edward could have married Simpson , as King he was also head of the Church of England , which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry . Edward 's ministers believed that the people would never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage . As a constitutional monarch , Edward was obliged to accept ministerial advice . Rather than abandon his plans to marry Simpson , he chose to abdicate in favour of Albert , who reluctantly became King in his place on 11 December 1936 under the regnal name of George VI . George VI and Elizabeth were crowned King and Queen of Great Britain , Ireland and the British Dominions , and Emperor and Empress of India on 12 May 1937 , the date already nominated for the coronation of Edward VIII . Elizabeth 's crown was made of platinum and was set with the Koh @-@ i @-@ Noor diamond . 
 Edward and Simpson married and became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor , but while Edward was a Royal Highness , George VI withheld the style from the Duchess , a decision that Elizabeth supported . Elizabeth was later quoted as referring to the Duchess as " that woman " , and the Duchess referred to Elizabeth as " Cookie " , because of her supposed resemblance to a fat Scots cook . Claims that Elizabeth remained embittered towards the Duchess were denied by her close friends ; the Duke of Grafton wrote that she " never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor , except to say she really hadn 't got a clue what she was dealing with .

 = = = State visits and royal tour = = = 
 In summer 1938 , a state visit to France by the King and Queen was postponed for three weeks because of the death of the Queen 's mother , Lady Strathmore . In two weeks , Norman Hartnell created an all @-@ white trousseau for the Queen , who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning . The visit was designed to bolster Anglo @-@ French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany . The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit , augmented by Hartnell 's wardrobe . 
 Nevertheless , Nazi aggression continued , and the government prepared for war . After the Munich Agreement of 1938 appeared to forestall the advent of armed conflict , the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was invited onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace with the King and Queen to receive acclamation from a crowd of well @-@ wishers . While broadly popular among the general public , Chamberlain 's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons , which led historian John Grigg to describe the King 's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as " the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century " . However , historians have also argued that the King only ever followed ministerial advice and acted as he was constitutionally bound to do . 
 In June 1939 , Elizabeth and her husband toured Canada from coast to coast and back , and visited the United States , spending time with President Roosevelt at the White House and his Hudson Valley estate . U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt said that Elizabeth was " perfect as a Queen , gracious , informed , saying the right thing & kind but a little self @-@ consciously regal " . The tour was designed to bolster trans @-@ Atlantic support in the event of war , and to affirm Canada 's status as an independent kingdom sharing with Britain the same person as monarch . According to an often @-@ told story , during one of the earliest of the royal couple 's repeated encounters with the crowds , a Boer War veteran asked Elizabeth , " Are you Scots or are you English ? " She replied , " I am a Canadian ! " Their reception by the Canadian and U.S. public was extremely enthusiastic , and largely dissipated any residual feeling that George and Elizabeth were a lesser substitute for Edward . Elizabeth told Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , " that tour made us " , and she returned to Canada frequently both on official tours and privately . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 During World War II , the King and Queen became symbols of the fight against fascism . Shortly after the declaration of war , The Queen 's Book of the Red Cross was conceived . Fifty authors and artists contributed to the book , which was fronted by Cecil Beaton 's portrait of the Queen and was sold in aid of the Red Cross . Elizabeth publicly refused to leave London or send the children to Canada , even during the Blitz , when she was advised by the Cabinet to do so . She declared , " The children won 't go without me . I won 't leave the King . And the King will never leave . " 
 She visited troops , hospitals , factories , and parts of Britain that were targeted by the German Luftwaffe , in particular the East End , near London 's docks . Her visits initially provoked hostility ; rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered , in part because she wore expensive clothes that served to alienate her from people suffering the deprivations of war . She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes , so she should reciprocate in kind ; Norman Hartnell dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent " the rainbow of hope " . When Buckingham Palace itself took several hits during the height of the bombing , Elizabeth was able to say , " I 'm glad we 've been bombed . It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face . " 
 Though the King and Queen spent the working day at Buckingham Palace , partly for security and family reasons they stayed at night at Windsor Castle about 20 miles ( 32 km ) west of central London with the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret . The Palace had lost much of its staff to the army , and most of the rooms were shut . The windows were shattered by bomb blasts , and had to be boarded up . During the " Phoney War " the Queen was given revolver training because of fears of imminent invasion . 
 Adolf Hitler is said to have called her " the most dangerous woman in Europe " because he viewed her popularity as a threat to German interests . However , before the war both she and her husband , like most of Parliament and the British public , had supported appeasement and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain , believing after the experience of the First World War that war had to be avoided at all costs . After the resignation of Chamberlain , the King asked Winston Churchill to form a government . Although the King was initially suspicious of his character and motives , in due course both the King and Queen came to respect and admire him . At the end of the war in 1945 , Churchill was invited onto the balcony in a similar gesture to that given to Chamberlain . 
 = = = Post @-@ war years = = = 
 In the 1945 British general election , Churchill 's Conservative party was soundly defeated by the Labour party of Clement Attlee . Elizabeth 's political views were rarely disclosed , but a letter she wrote in 1947 described Attlee 's " high hopes of a socialist heaven on earth " as fading and presumably describes those who voted for him as " poor people , so many half @-@ educated and bemused . I do love them . " Woodrow Wyatt thought her " much more pro @-@ Conservative " than other members of the royal family , but she later told him , " I like the dear old Labour Party . " She also told the Duchess of Grafton , " I love communists " . After six years in office , Attlee was defeated in the 1951 British general election and Churchill returned to power . 
 During the 1947 royal tour of South Africa , Elizabeth 's serene public behaviour was broken , exceptionally , when she rose from the royal car to strike an admirer with her umbrella because she had mistaken his enthusiasm for hostility . The 1948 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed because of the King 's declining health . In March 1949 , he had a successful operation to improve the circulation in his right leg . In summer 1951 , Queen Elizabeth and her daughters fulfilled the King 's public engagements in his place . In September , he was diagnosed with lung cancer . After a lung resection , he appeared to recover , but the delayed trip to Australia and New Zealand was altered so that Princess Elizabeth and her husband , the Duke of Edinburgh , went in the King and Queen 's place , in January 1952 . The King died while Princess Elizabeth and the Duke were in Kenya en route to the southern hemisphere , and they returned immediately to London as the new Queen and consort . They would not finally visit Australia and New Zealand until 1954 .

 = = = Widowhood = = = 
 King George VI died in his sleep on 6 February 1952 . Elizabeth began to be styled as Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother because the normal style for the widow of a king , " Queen Elizabeth " , would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter , now Queen Elizabeth II . Popularly , she became the " Queen Mother " or the " Queen Mum " . 
 She was devastated by the King 's death and retired to Scotland . However , after a meeting with the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , she broke her retirement and resumed her public duties . Eventually she became just as busy as Queen Mother as she had been as Queen . In July 1953 , she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Princess Margaret . She laid the foundation stone of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland – the current University of Zimbabwe . On her return to the region in 1957 , she was inaugurated as the College 's President , and attended other events that were deliberately designed to be multi @-@ racial . During her daughter 's extensive tour of the Commonwealth over 1953 – 54 , Elizabeth acted as a Counsellor of State and looked after her grandchildren , Charles and Anne . 
 She oversaw the restoration of the remote Castle of Mey , in Caithness on the north coast of Scotland , which she used to " get away from everything " for three weeks in August and ten days in October each year . She developed her interest in horse racing , particularly steeplechasing , which had been inspired by the amateur jockey Lord Mildmay in 1949 . She owned the winners of approximately 500 races . Her distinctive colours of blue with buff stripes were carried by horses such as Special Cargo , the winner of the 1984 Whitbread Gold Cup , and Devon Loch , which spectacularly halted just short of the winning post at the 1956 Grand National and whose jockey Dick Francis later had a successful career as the writer of racing @-@ themed detective stories . Peter Cazalet was her trainer for over 20 years . Although ( contrary to rumour ) she never placed bets , she did have the racing commentaries piped direct to her London residence , Clarence House , so she could follow the races . As an art collector , she purchased works by Claude Monet , Augustus John and Peter Carl Fabergé , among others . 
 In February 1964 , she had an emergency appendectomy , which led to the postponement of a planned tour of Australia , New Zealand and Fiji until 1966 . She recuperated during a Caribbean cruise aboard the royal yacht , Britannia . In December 1966 , she underwent an operation to remove a tumour after she was diagnosed with colon cancer . Contrary to rumours , she did not have a colostomy . In 1982 , she was rushed to hospital when a fish bone became stuck in her throat , and had an operation to remove it . Being a keen angler , she calmly joked afterwards , " The salmon have got their own back . " Similar incidents occurred at Balmoral in August 1986 , when she was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary but no operation was needed , and May 1993 , when she was admitted to the Infirmary for surgery under general anaesthetic . In 1984 , she had a second operation for cancer , when a lump was removed from her breast , and a second gastric obstruction in 1986 cleared without the need for an operation , but she was hospitalised overnight . 
 In 1975 , she visited Iran at the invitation of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi . The British ambassador and his wife , Anthony and Sheila Parsons , noted how the Iranians were bemused by her habit of speaking to everyone regardless of status or importance , and hoped the Shah 's entourage would learn from the visit to pay more attention to ordinary people . Four years later , the Shah was deposed . Between 1976 and 1984 , she made annual summer visits to France , which were among 22 private trips to continental Europe between 1963 and 1992 . 
 Queen Elizabeth — known for her personal and public charm — was one of the most popular members of the royal family . Her signature dress of large upturned hat with netting and dresses with draped panels of fabric became a distinctive personal style .

 In her later years , the Queen Mother became known for her longevity . Her 90th birthday — 4 August 1990 — was celebrated by a parade on 27 June that involved many of the 300 organisations of which she was patron . In 1995 , she attended events commemorating the end of the war fifty years before , and had two operations : one to remove a cataract in her left eye , and one to replace her right hip . In 1998 , her left hip was replaced after it was broken when she slipped and fell during a visit to Sandringham stables . Her 100th birthday was celebrated in a number of ways : a parade that celebrated the highlights of her life included contributions from Norman Wisdom and John Mills ; her image appeared on a special commemorative £ 20 note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland ; and she attended a lunch at the Guildhall , London , at which George Carey , the Archbishop of Canterbury , accidentally attempted to drink her glass of wine . Her quick admonition of " That 's mine ! " caused widespread amusement . In November 2000 , she broke her collarbone in a fall that kept her recuperating at home over Christmas and the New Year . On 1 August 2001 , she had a blood transfusion for anaemia after suffering from mild heat exhaustion , though she was well enough to make her traditional appearance outside Clarence House three days later to celebrate her 101st birthday . Her final public engagements included planting a cross at the Field of Remembrance on 8 November 2001 ; a reception at the Guildhall , London , for the reformation of the 600 Squadron , Royal Auxiliary Air Force on 15 November ; and attending the re @-@ commissioning of HMS Ark Royal on 22 November . 
 In December 2001 , aged 101 , she fractured her pelvis in a fall . Even so , she insisted on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her husband on 6 February the following year . Just three days later , her second daughter Princess Margaret died . On 13 February 2002 , the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House ; an ambulance and doctor were called , and the wound was dressed . She was still determined to attend Margaret 's funeral at St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , two days later on the Friday of that week , even though the Queen and the rest of the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor ; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating . Nevertheless , she flew to Windsor by helicopter , and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken — she insisted that she be shielded from the press — she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked – out windows , which had been previously used by Margaret . On 5 March 2002 , she was present at the luncheon of the annual lawn party of the Eton Beagles , and watched the Cheltenham Races on television ; however , her health began to deteriorate precipitately during her last weeks after retreating to Royal Lodge for the final time . 
 = = Death = = 
 On 30 March 2002 , at 15 : 15 ( GMT ) , the Queen Mother died in her sleep at the Royal Lodge , Windsor Great Park , with her surviving daughter , Queen Elizabeth II , at her bedside . She had been suffering from a cold for the last four months of her life . She was 101 years old , and at the time of her death was the longest @-@ lived member of the royal family in British history . This record was broken on 24 July 2003 , by her last surviving sister @-@ in @-@ law Princess Alice , Duchess of Gloucester , who died aged 102 on 29 October 2004 . 
 Elizabeth grew camellias in every one of her gardens , and before her flag @-@ draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall , an arrangement of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top . More than 200 @,@ 000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster . Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque . At one point , her four grandsons Prince Charles , Prince Andrew , Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect known as the Vigil of the Princes — an honour bestowed only once before , at the lying in state of King George V. 
 On the day of her funeral , 9 April , the Governor General of Canada issued a proclamation asking Canadians to honour her memory that day . In Australia , the Governor @-@ General read the lesson at a memorial service held in St Andrew 's Cathedral , Sydney . In London , more than a million people filled the area outside Westminster Abbey and along the 23 @-@ mile ( 37 km ) route from central London to her final resting place beside her husband and younger daughter in St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle . At her request , after her funeral the wreath that had lain atop her coffin was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior , in a gesture that echoed her wedding @-@ day tribute 79 years before .

 Despite being regarded as one of the most popular members of the royal family in recent times who helped to stabilise the popularity of the monarchy as a whole , Elizabeth was subject to various degrees of criticism during her life . 
 Kitty Kelley alleged that during World War II Elizabeth did not abide by the rationing regulations . This is contradicted by the official records , and Eleanor Roosevelt during her wartime stay at Buckingham Palace reported expressly on the rationed food served in the Palace and the limited bathwater that was permitted . 
 Further allegations that Elizabeth used racist slurs to refer to black people were strongly denied by Major Colin Burgess . Major Burgess was the husband of Elizabeth Burgess , a mixed @-@ race secretary who accused members of the Prince of Wales 's Household of racial abuse . Queen Elizabeth made no public comments on race , but according to Robert Rhodes James in private she " abhorred racial discrimination " and decried apartheid as " dreadful " . Woodrow Wyatt records in his diary that when he expressed the view that non @-@ white countries have nothing in common with " us " , she told him , " I am very keen on the Commonwealth . They 're all like us . " However , she did distrust Germans ; she told Woodrow Wyatt , " Never trust them , never trust them . " While she may have held such views , it has been argued that they were normal for British people of her generation and upbringing , who had experienced two vicious wars with Germany . 
 In 1987 , she was criticised when it emerged that two of her nieces , Katherine Bowes @-@ Lyon and <unk> Bowes @-@ Lyon , had both been committed to a psychiatric hospital because they were severely handicapped . However , Burke 's Peerage had listed the sisters as dead , apparently because their mother , Fenella ( the Queen Mother 's sister @-@ in @-@ law ) , " was ' extremely vague ' when it came to filling in forms and might not have completed the paperwork for the family entry correctly " . When <unk> had died the year before , her grave was originally marked with a plastic tag and a serial number . The Queen Mother claimed that the news of their institutionalisation came as a surprise to her . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Sir Hugh Casson said Elizabeth was like " a wave breaking on a rock , because although she is sweet and pretty and charming , she also has a basic streak of toughness and tenacity . ... when a wave breaks on a rock , it showers and sparkles with a brilliant play of foam and droplets in the sun , yet beneath is really hard , tough rock , fused , in her case , from strong principles , physical courage and a sense of duty . " Peter Ustinov described her during a student demonstration at the University of Dundee in 1968 : 
 As we arrived in a solemn procession the students pelted us with toilet rolls . They kept hold of one end , like streamers at a ball , and threw the other end . The Queen Mother stopped and picked these up as though somebody had misplaced them . [ Returning them to the students she said , ] ' Was this yours ? Oh , could you take it ? ' And it was her sang @-@ froid and her absolute refusal to be shocked by this , which immediately silenced all the students . She knows instinctively what to do on those occasions . She doesn 't rise to being heckled at all ; she just pretends it must be an oversight on the part of the people doing it . The way she reacted not only showed her presence of mind , but was so charming and so disarming , even to the most rabid element , that she brought peace to troubled waters . 
 Elizabeth was well known for her dry witticisms . On hearing that Edwina Mountbatten was buried at sea , she said : " Dear Edwina , she always liked to make a splash . " Accompanied by the gay writer Sir Noël Coward at a gala , she mounted a staircase lined with Guards . Noticing Coward 's eyes flicker momentarily across the soldiers , she murmured to him : " I wouldn 't if I were you , Noël ; they count them before they put them out . " After being advised by a Conservative Minister in the 1970s not to employ homosexuals , the Queen Mother observed that without them , " we 'd have to go self @-@ service " . On the fate of a gift of a <unk> of champagne ( 20 bottles ' worth ) even if her family didn 't come for the holidays , she said , " I 'll polish it off myself . " <unk> Saner of The Guardian suggests that with a gin and Dubonnet at noon , red wine with lunch , a port and martini at 6 pm and two glasses of champagne at dinner , " a conservative estimate puts the number of alcohol units she drank at 70 a week " . Her extravagant lifestyle amused journalists , particularly when it was revealed she had a multi @-@ million pound overdraft with Coutts Bank . 
 Her habits were often parodied ( with relative affection ) by the satirical 1980s television programme Spitting Image – which portrayed her with a Birmingham accent and an ever @-@ present copy of the Racing Post . She was portrayed in the 2002 television film Bertie and Elizabeth by Juliet Aubrey , the 2006 film The Queen by Sylvia Syms and the 2010 film The King 's Speech by Helena Bonham Carter , who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal . She was also played by Natalie Dormer in the film W.E. , directed by Madonna and by Olivia Colman in the 2012 film Hyde Park on Hudson , which featured Elizabeth and Albert 's visit to President Roosevelt 's estate . 
 The Cunard White Star Line 's RMS Queen Elizabeth was named after her . She launched the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank , Scotland . Supposedly , the liner started to slide into the water before Elizabeth could officially launch her , and acting sharply , she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner 's bow just before it slid out of reach . In 1954 , Queen Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake . 
 A statue of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother by sculptor Philip Jackson was unveiled in front of the George VI Memorial , off The Mall , London , on 24 February 2009 , creating the George VI and Queen Elizabeth Memorial . 
 In March 2011 , her eclectic musical taste was revealed when details of her small record collection kept at the Castle of Mey were made public . Her records included ska , local folk , Scottish reels and the musicals Oklahoma ! and The King and I , and artists such as <unk> Montana Slim , Tony Hancock , The Goons and Noël Coward . 
 Eight years before her death , she had reportedly placed two @-@ thirds of her money into trusts , for the benefit of her great @-@ grandchildren . She left the bulk of her estate , estimated to be worth £ 70 million , including paintings , Fabergé eggs , jewellery , and horses , to her surviving daughter , Queen Elizabeth II . As property passing from monarch to monarch is exempt from Inheritance Tax , as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch , a tax liability estimated at £ 28 million ( 40 % of the value of the estate ) was not incurred . The most important pieces of art were transferred to the Royal Collection by Elizabeth II .

 Samuel Bruce " Sammy " Vick ( April 12 , 1895 – August 17 , 1986 ) was an American professional right fielder in Major League Baseball . He played for the New York Yankees from 1917 to 1920 , and the Boston Red Sox in 1921 . He stood 5 ft 10 in ( 1 @.@ 78 m ) , and weighed 163 lb . , and he batted and threw right @-@ handed . He was born in Batesville , Mississippi , and attended <unk> College in Jackson , Mississippi . 
 After playing one season of minor league baseball in 1917 , Vick was signed by the Yankees and was used sparingly by them later that same season . He became their starting right fielder in 1919 . With Babe Ruth 's arrival , and Bob Meusel 's emergence in 1920 , Vick 's productivity and playing time diminished . Following the season , he was traded to the Red Sox in a deal that brought future Hall of Famer pitcher Waite Hoyt to the Yankees . In his five @-@ season career , Vick had a .248 batting average , with two home runs and 50 RBIs in 213 games played . 
 After his major league career ended after the 1921 season , he returned to the minor leagues and played in various leagues until 1930 . Vick died , after a long illness , in Memphis , Tennessee , at age 91 .

 Samuel Bruce Vick was born on April 12 , 1895 in Batesville , Mississippi , to Hugh , a farmer , and Lillie . After attending <unk> College in Jackson , Mississippi , he signed a minor league baseball contract with the Memphis Chickasaws of the Southern Association ( SA ) . He played one season in Memphis , playing in 126 games , and had a .322 batting average along with 24 doubles and 12 triples . When the SA season was completed , he signed a contract with the New York Yankees of the American League ( AL ) .

 Vick made his Major League Baseball ( MLB ) debut with the Yankees on September 20 , 1917 . He finished the season with the Yankees , playing in 10 games , all in right field . In 36 at bats during that stretch , he collected 10 hits for a .278 batting average . He played in just two games during the early part of the 1918 season , before being drafted into the military . The first appearance occurred on April 19 , in the second game of a double header against the Boston Red Sox . He relieved starting right fielder Frank Gilhooley late in the game , and collected a hit in each of his two at bats in against Red Sox pitcher , Babe Ruth . He had a run batted in ( RBI ) and scored a run in the game , although the Red Sox won the game by a score of 9 to 5 . His other appearance that season was as a pinch hitter in a game against the Washington Senators on April 25 , and failed to collect a hit . 
 In 1919 , Vick became the Yankees 's starting right fielder . On April 30 , in his fourth appearance of the season , he led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run off of Mule Watson of the Philadelphia Athletics : his first career home run . He struggled at the plate during the first two months of the season , with a batting average of .208 after the June 1 game . However , he began to increase his productivity in June and July . By early August , he had raised his average to a season @-@ high of .266 . It was during that time period when he hit his second , and last , major league home run . It was a grand slam off of Allan <unk> in a game on August 7 : an 8 – 2 victory over the St. Louis Browns . For the remainder of the season , Vick 's production had a steady , slow decline ; he finished the season with a .248 batting average , along with 27 RBIs , 15 doubles , and nine triples . 
 Vick 's playing time dwindled in 1920 with the arrival of Babe Ruth , an off @-@ season purchase from the Red Sox . The Yankees now had an outfield that consisted of Ruth , established players of Duffy Lewis and Ping Bodie , and Bob Meusel , a rookie . Injuries to Lewis and Bodie allowed for periods of lengthy playing time for Vick in July and September . Later in the season , Vick and his manager Miller Huggins got into a heated argument , during which Vick punched Huggins . Appreciating Vick 's spirit , the manager quickly forgave him . Vick 's final totals in 1920 consisted of a .220 batting average in 51 games . During his time with the Yankees , the New York City sportswriters noted that he was prodigious eater . He was so much so that they proclaimed that any time someone ate a large meal , they were " doing a Sammy Vick . " 
 = = = Boston Red Sox = = = 
 The Yankees felt that Vick had not lived up to his potential during his four seasons with the team . Considering the team now had a solid outfield of Ruth , Meusel , Lewis , and Bodie , and the Yankees needed pitching ; Vick became expendable . On December 15 , 1920 , the Yankees traded Vick , Muddy Ruel , Del Pratt and Hank <unk> to the Red Sox for Waite Hoyt , Harry Harper , Wally Schang and Mike McNally . 
 Vick began the 1921 season with an injured leg , which did not allow him the play in either April or May . He did not appear in a game until June 2 , and was mostly used as a pinch hitter and late @-@ game replacement . He was absent from the line @-@ up for most of July as well , until August when again , he was used mainly as a pinch hitter . In total , he played in just 44 games for the Red Sox , with only 15 games in the outfield ; 12 of them starting the game . Vick had a season @-@ total of 77 at bats , a .260 batting average , and nine RBIs .

 After the 1921 season , Vick continued his baseball career in the minor leagues . In 1922 , he played for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League , batting .233 in 50 games played . He returned to the Memphis Chickasaws for one season in 1923 , improving his average to .290 . For the 1924 season , he joined the Brookhaven Truckers of the Cotton States League ( CSL ) as player @-@ manager , and he produced the best offensive numbers up to this point in his career . He batted .322 with 16 home runs , 21 doubles , and 11 triples . 
 In 1925 , Vick stayed in the CSL , but became the Laurel Lumberjacks 's non @-@ playing manager for two seasons . However , in 1926 , his tenure was short , and he joined the New Orleans Pelicans of the SA as a player only for the remaining 32 games of the season . After batting .348 in 1926 , he improved his average to .350 in 1927 , along with career @-@ highs in hits with 194 , doubles with 39 , and triples with 16 . Staying in New Orleans for the 1928 season , his offensive numbers dropped , but he still batted .302 in 109 games played . His 1929 season was split between three teams ; the Pelicans , the Chattanooga Lookouts of the SA , and the Dallas Steers of the Texas League .

 = Last of the Summer Wine = 
 Last of the Summer Wine is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke that was originally broadcast on the BBC . Last of the Summer Wine premiered as an episode of Comedy Playhouse on 4 January 1973 , and the first series of episodes followed on 12 November 1973 . From 1983 to 2010 , Alan J. W. Bell produced and directed all episodes of the show . The BBC confirmed on 2 June 2010 that Last of the Summer Wine would no longer be produced and the 31st series would be its last . Subsequently , the final episode was broadcast on 29 August 2010 . Tom Owen criticised the BBC for not permitting a special final episode . Roy Clarke , however , stated that he was fully aware this was the last series , and preferred the show to have a quiet ending . The final line was said by Peter Sallis , the longest serving actor . Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on Gold , Yesterday , and Drama . It is also seen in more than twenty @-@ five countries , including various PBS stations in the United States and on <unk> in Canada . Last of the Summer Wine is the longest @-@ running comedy programme in Britain and the longest @-@ running sitcom in the world . 
 Last of the Summer Wine was set and filmed in and around Holmfirth , West Yorkshire , England , and centred on a trio of old men and their youthful antics ; the membership of the trio changed several times over the years . The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the scruffy and childlike Compo Simmonite , Peter Sallis as deep @-@ thinking and meek Norman Clegg , and Michael Bates as authoritarian and snobbish Cyril Blamire . When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series , the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter " Foggy " Dewhurst ( Brian Wilde ) , who had two lengthy stints in the series , the eccentric inventor Seymour <unk> ( Michael Aldridge ) , and former police officer Herbert " Truly of The Yard " Truelove ( Frank Thornton ) . The men never seem to grow up , and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts . Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio , with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters , over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece . Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio , or on occasion having their own , separate storylines . 
 After the death of Owen in 1999 , Compo was replaced at various times by his real @-@ life son , Tom Owen , as equally unkempt Tom Simmonite , Keith Clifford as Billy Hardcastle , a man who fancied himself as a descendant of Robin Hood , and Brian Murphy as the childish Alvin Smedley . Due to the age of the main cast , a new trio was formed during the 30th series featuring somewhat younger actors , and this format was used for the final two instalments of the show . This group consisted of Russ Abbot as a former milkman who fancied himself a secret agent , Luther " Hobbo " Hobdyke , Burt Kwouk as the electrical repairman , " Electrical " Entwistle , and Murphy as Alvin Smedley . Sallis and Thornton , both past members of the trio , continued in supporting roles alongside the new actors . 
 Although many feel the show 's quality declined over the years , Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large audiences for the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal of older people and family @-@ friendly humour . Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show . The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999 . There were twenty @-@ one Christmas specials , three television films and a documentary film about the series . Last of the Summer Wine inspired other adaptations , including a television prequel , several novelisations , and stage adaptations .

 In 1972 , Duncan Wood , the BBC 's Head of Comedy , watched a comedy on television called The Misfit . Impressed by writer Roy Clarke 's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom , Wood offered Clarke the opportunity to write a sitcom . Clarke nearly turned the job down as he felt that the BBC 's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half @-@ hour sitcom . Instead , Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried , widowed , or divorced and either unemployed or retired , leaving them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives , unfettered and uninhibited . 
 Clarke chose the original title , The Last of the Summer Wine , to convey the idea that the characters are not in the autumn of their lives but the summer , even though it may be " the last of the summer " . BBC producers hated this at first and insisted that it remain a temporary working title , while the cast worried that viewers would forget the name of the show . The working title was changed later to The Library Mob , a reference to one of the trio 's regular haunts early in the show . Clarke switched back to his original preference shortly before production began , a title that was shortened to Last of the Summer Wine after the pilot show . 
 The Last of the Summer Wine premiered as an episode of BBC 's Comedy Playhouse on 4 January 1973 . The pilot , " Of Funerals and Fish " , received enough positive response that a full series was commissioned to be broadcast before the end of the year . Although the initial series did not do well in the ratings , the BBC ordered a second series in 1975 . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Barry Took , who had produced a series of ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about working men 's clubs , was partially responsible for the choice of location for the exterior shots . The programme which drew the highest ratings of the series focused on <unk> Working Men 's Club , a club in the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth and Took saw Holmfirth 's potential as the backdrop of a television show . Took 's idea was passed to James Gilbert and Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood , who was at that time filming Comedy Playhouse . Gilbert and Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the setting for the pilot of Last of the Summer Wine . 
 Though the exterior shots were always filmed on location in Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside , the interior shots were , until the early 1990s , filmed in front of a live studio audience at BBC Television Centre in London . The amount of location work increased , however , as studio work became a drain on time and money . Under Alan J. W. Bell , Last of the Summer Wine became the first comedy series to do away with the live studio audience , moving all of the filming to Holmfirth . The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences , whose laughter was recorded and then mixed into each episode 's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of canned laughter . 
 The show used actual businesses and homes in and around Holmfirth , and Nora Batty 's house , which is actually a Summer Wine themed holiday cottage where members of the public can stay in a replica of Nora Batty 's home . Although this has helped the Holmfirth economy and made it a tourist destination , tensions have occasionally surfaced between Holmfirth residents and the crew . One such incident , regarding compensation to local residents , prompted producer Alan J. W. Bell to consider not filming in Holmfirth any more . The situation escalated to the point that Bell filmed a scene in which Nora Batty put her house up for sale . 
 = = = Cast and crew = = = 
 Every episode of Last of the Summer Wine was written by Roy Clarke and every episode featured Peter Sallis as Clegg . The Comedy Playhouse pilot and all episodes of the first series were produced and directed by James Gilbert . Bernard Thompson produced and directed the second series of episodes in 1975 . In 1976 , Sydney Lotterby took over as producer and director . He directed all but two episodes of the third series – Ray Butt directed " The Great Boarding House Bathroom Caper " and " Cheering up Gordon " . Lotterby directed two further series before departing the show in 1979 . In 1981 , Alan J. W. Bell took over as producer and director . Bell , in an effort to get each scene exactly right , was known for his use of more film and more takes than his predecessors and for using wider angles that feature more of the local Holmfirth landscape . 
 In 1983 , Lotterby returned to the show at the insistence of Brian Wilde , who preferred Lotterby 's use of tight shots focused on the trio as they talked rather than Bell 's wide @-@ angle scenes . Lotterby produced and directed one additional series before departing again the same year . Bell then returned to the show beginning with the 1983 Christmas special and produced and directed all episodes of the show to the end of the 31st series . 
 In 2008 , Bell announced that he had quit as producer of Last of the Summer Wine . Citing differences with the BBC and his dislike of their indifference towards the series , Bell said , " I have now decided I will not do it again . I have had enough of the BBC 's attitude . " The announcement came following rumours initiated by Bell that the network would not commission another series of episodes following the 30th series and their indecision regarding a possible one @-@ off special . However , on 26 June 2009 , the BBC announced that it had recommissioned the show for a 31st series with Bell continuing as producer and director . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Composer and conductor Ronnie Hazlehurst , who has also produced themes for such series as Are You Being Served ? , Yes Minister , and Only Fools and Horses , created the theme for the show . The BBC initially disliked Hazlehurst 's theme , feeling it was not proper for a comedy programme to have such mellow music . He was asked to play the music faster for more comedic effect but eventually his original slower version was accepted . 
 The theme , an instrumental work , featured lyrics three times . The 1981 Christmas special , " Whoops " , had two verses of lyrics written by Roy Clarke that were performed over the closing credits . The 1983 film , " Getting Sam Home " , used those two verses , with an additional two and played them over the opening credits . Another altered version was sung during Compo 's funeral in the 2000 episode " Just a Small Funeral " . Bill Owen also wrote a different version of the lyrics but this version was never used during an episode of the show . 
 Composing the score for each episode until his death in 2007 , Hazlehurst spent an average of ten hours per episode watching scenes and making notes for music synchronisation . Hazlehurst then recorded the music using an orchestra consisting of a guitar , harmonica , two violins , a viola , cello , accordion , horn , bass , flute , and percussion . The distinctive harmonica was played by Harry Pitch , who had featured in the 1970 one @-@ hit @-@ wonder " Groovin With Mr <unk> " .

 Despite numerous cast and production changes over the years , Last of the Summer Wine continued to be popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports to the contrary . Rumours circulated as early as the 1980s that the BBC wanted to end the show and replace it with a new programme aimed at a younger audience . Its popularity made this decision hard to justify , however , since even repeats sometimes received ratings of as many as five million viewers per episode . 
 In December 2008 , Alan J. W. Bell stated in an interview with The Daily Telegraph that the BBC had not yet commissioned a new series and that bosses at the network told him one would not be produced . Bell criticised this decision , stating that " millions still enjoy the series and the actors love being involved " and that it would be a terrible blow to the shops and businesses in Holmfirth who have come to depend on tourist revenue . The BBC denied these claims , saying that a decision had not yet been reached whether to commission another series or not . 
 It was confirmed on 26 June 2009 that a 31st series of 6 episodes had been commissioned for transmission in 2010 . However , on 2 June 2010 , the BBC announced that it would not renew Last of the Summer Wine after its thirty @-@ first series was broadcast during the summer of 2010 . The final episode of the show , " How Not to Cry at Weddings " , was subsequently broadcast on 29 August 2010 . 
 = = Characters and casting = = 
 Initially , the only certain cast member for the show was Peter Sallis . Clarke had already collaborated on a few scripts with him and the character of Norman Clegg was created especially for Sallis , who liked the character and agreed to play him . He was soon joined by an actor he had previously worked with , comedy actor Michael Bates as Cyril Blamire . 
 James Gilbert had seen film actor Bill Owen playing northern characters in the Royal Court Theatre and proposed to cast him as Compo Simmonite . Clarke , who initially saw Owen as an archetypal cockney who could not play as solid a northern character as Compo was meant to be , recognised Owen 's potential only after going to London for a read @-@ through with him . 
 On @-@ screen chemistry with existing players determined the later changes to the cast . Brian Wilde , Michael Aldridge and Frank Thornton each brought a sense of completion to the trio after the departure of the preceding third man . Tom Owen provided a direct link between his father and himself after the death of Bill Owen . Keith Clifford was added following three popular guest appearances on the show . Brian Murphy was chosen as Nora Batty 's neighbour because of his work on George and Mildred , where he played the hen @-@ pecked husband to a strong @-@ willed woman . 
 In 2008 , the BBC announced that Russ Abbot would join the cast as a relatively more youthful actor in series 30 . Abbot was cast to allow Sallis and Thornton to reduce their role on the show to only indoor scenes . Abbot portrayed Luther " Hobbo " Hobdyke , who formed a new trio with Entwistle and Alvin . Entwistle , played by Burt Kwouk , was formerly a supporting character brought in to replace Wesley Pegden after the death of actor Gordon Wharmby , but whose role on the show steadily increased in the previous two series . 
 The original cast of Last of the Summer Wine also included a handful of characters with whom the trio regularly interacted . Kathy Staff was chosen to play Compo 's neighbour , Nora Batty . Gilbert was initially sceptical about casting Staff but changed his mind after she padded herself to look bigger and read from a scene between her character and Owen 's . This group was rounded out by characters at two locations frequented by the trio : John Comer and Jane Freeman as Sid and Ivy , the quarrelling husband @-@ and @-@ wife owners of the local café ; and Blake Butler and Rosemary Martin as Mr. Wainwright and Mrs. Partridge , the librarians having a not @-@ so @-@ secret affair . Butler and Martin , however , were dropped as major characters after the first series . According to Peter Sallis , Roy Clarke felt there was little more he could do with them . 
 Supporting cast members were added throughout the run of the show . The only addition with no professional acting experience was the Holmfirth resident Gordon Wharmby , who performed so well during his audition as mechanic Wesley Pegden that Alan J. W. Bell cast him in one episode . Pegden became a regular character after a positive audience reception . 
 When Alan J. W. Bell took over as producer , the plots of Last of the Summer Wine moved away from the original dialogue @-@ packed scenes in the pub and the library ; guest actors were brought in to interact with the trio in new situations . Although many of these guest appearances would last for only one episode , some led to a permanent role on the show , as in the cases of Gordon Wharmby , Thora Hird , Jean Alexander , Stephen Lewis , Dora Bryan , Keith Clifford , Brian Murphy , Josephine Tewson , June Whitfield , Barbara Young , and Trevor Bannister . Other noted guests on the programme included John Cleese , Ron Moody , Sir Norman Wisdom , Eric Sykes , Liz Fraser , Stanley Lebor , and Philip Jackson . 
 = = Scenario = = 
 Last of the Summer Wine focused on a trio of older men and their youthful antics . The original trio consisted of Compo Simmonite , Norman Clegg , and Cyril Blamire . Blamire left in 1976 , when Michael Bates fell ill shortly before filming of the third series , requiring Clarke to hastily rewrite the series with a new third man . The third member of the trio would be recast four times over the next three decades : Foggy Dewhurst in 1976 , Seymour <unk> in 1986 , Foggy again in 1990 , and Truly Truelove in 1997 . After Compo died in 2000 , Compo 's son , Tom Simmonite , filled the gap for the rest of that series , and Billy Hardcastle joined the cast as the third lead character in 2001 . The trio became a quartet between 2003 and 2006 when Alvin Smedley moved in next @-@ door to Nora Batty , but returned to the usual threesome in 2006 when Billy Hardcastle left the show . The role of supporting character Entwistle steadily grew on the show until the beginning of the 30th series , when he and Alvin were recruited by Hobbo Hobdyke , a former milkman with ties to MI5 , to form a new trio of volunteers who respond to any emergency . 
 The trio explored the world around them , experiencing a second childhood with no wives , jobs , or responsibilities . They passed the time by speculating about their fellow townspeople and testing inventions . Regular subplots in the first decade of the show included : Sid and Ivy bickering over the management of the café , Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge having a secret love affair that everyone knows about , Wally trying to get away from Nora 's watchful eye , Foggy 's exaggerated war stories , and Compo 's schemes to win the affections of Nora Batty . 
 The number of subplots on the show grew as more cast members were added . Regular subplots since the 1980s included : Howard and Marina trying to have an affair without Howard 's wife finding out ( a variation of the Wainwright @-@ Partridge subplot of the 1970s ) , the older women meeting for tea and discussing their theories about men and life , Auntie Wainwright trying to sell unwanted merchandise to unsuspecting customers , Smiler trying to find a woman , Barry trying to better himself ( at the insistence of Glenda ) , and Tom trying to stay one step ahead of the repo man .

 In 1978 , the BBC commissioned a Last of the Summer Wine Christmas special instead of a new series . Titled " Small Tune on a Penny Wassail " , it was broadcast on 26 December 1978 . Other Christmas programmes followed in 1979 and 1981 . The 1981 special , " Whoops " , gained 17 million viewers and was beaten only by Coronation Street for the number one spot . Christmas shows were produced infrequently thereafter and sometimes were the only new episodes in years without an order for a new series . This happened often during the 1980s when Roy Clarke 's commitment to Open All Hours prevented the production of a full series every year . The specials often included well @-@ known guest stars such as John Cleese and June Whitfield . 
 The first New Year special , " The Man who Nearly Knew Pavarotti " , was commissioned in 1994 . The hour @-@ long show was broadcast on 1 January 1995 and featured Norman Wisdom as a piano player who had lost the confidence to play . A second New Year programme was produced and broadcast in 2000 to celebrate the new millennium . It featured the second guest appearance by Keith Clifford and a guest appearance by Dora Bryan . Titled " Last Post and Pigeon " , the show ran for sixty minutes and dealt with the trio 's pilgrimage to visit World War II graves in France . Part of this special was shot on location in France . A third New Year show , titled " I Was a Hitman for Primrose Dairies " , was broadcast on 31 December 2008 and introduced Hobbo and the new trio he formed with Entwistle and Alvin .

 In 1983 , Bill Owen suggested to returning producer Alan J. W. Bell that Roy Clarke 's novelisation of the show should be made into a feature @-@ length special . Other British sitcoms such as Steptoe and Son and Dad 's Army had previously produced films made for the cinema , but the BBC were initially sceptical as they had never before commissioned a film based on a comedy programme for original broadcast on television . They nevertheless commissioned a ninety @-@ minute film named " Getting Sam Home " , which was broadcast on 27 December 1983 , and started a trend which would continue with other British sitcoms , including Only Fools and Horses . 
 After the success of " Getting Sam Home " , a second film was made in 1986 . Titled " Uncle of the Bride " , the film featured the introduction of Michael Aldridge as Seymour , the new third man of the trio . The plot centred on the marriage of Seymour 's niece , Glenda ( Sarah Thomas ) , to Barry ( Mike Grady ) . Also making her first appearance in the film was Thora Hird as Seymour 's sister and Glenda 's mother , Edie , as well as re @-@ introducing Gordon Wharmby as Edie 's husband Wesley , previously seen in a popular one @-@ off appearance . The second film proved a success and all four new characters were carried over to the show beginning with the ninth series in 1986 .

 A spin @-@ off prequel show , First of the Summer Wine , premiered on BBC1 in 1988 . The new programme was written by Roy Clarke and used different actors to follow the activities of the principal characters from Last of the Summer Wine in the months leading up to World War II . Unlike its mother show , First of the Summer Wine was not filmed in Holmfirth . Period music was used instead of Ronnie Hazlehurst 's score to create a more World War II era atmosphere . New supporting characters were added to those from Last of the Summer Wine . Peter Sallis and Jonathan Linsley were the only actors from the original series to appear in the spin @-@ off : Sallis played the father of his own character from the original show and Linsley appeared during the second series as a different character . 
 The spin @-@ off show could not build on its early success and was cancelled after two series of thirteen episodes in 1989 . Although the BBC has never rerun the show , it has been broadcast on Gold and internationally .

 In 2014 , it was announced that long @-@ time supporting actors Ken Kitson and Louis Emerick had returned to Holmfirth to reprise their roles as Police Constables Cooper and Walsh in the pilot for a new proposed spin @-@ off , Cooper and Walsh . Alan J.W. Bell as well as crew from Last of the Summer Wine were involved in the creation of two short films while Kitson and Emerick appealed for funding through crowd @-@ sourcing sites in the hopes of gaining enough support to produce a feature film featuring the duo or even a television series . Associate Producer Terry <unk> believed there was enough of a cope with Cooper and Walsh that they could carry their own series and that this spin @-@ off could be the answer to those who believed Last of the Summer Wine should have been given a proper ending . 
 = = = Stage adaptations = = = 
 A live production of Last of the Summer Wine , known informally as the " summer season " , was produced in Bournemouth in 1984 . While Bill Owen and Peter Sallis reprised their roles as Compo and Clegg , Brian Wilde chose not to take part because of personal differences with Owen . The show focused on the men 's interaction with Clegg 's new neighbour , Howard ( Kenneth Waller ) , and his wife , Pearl , played by a local actress . The first act built up to the appearance of Marina ( Jean Fergusson ) , who was in correspondence with Howard . At the end of the first act , Marina was revealed to be a blonde sexpot . Howard and Marina 's story line was partly based on an early subplot of the television show . In the first series , the librarian , Mr. Wainwright , was having a love affair with his married assistant , Mrs. Partridge . Despite their efforts to keep the plot a secret , especially from Mrs. Partridge 's husband , the trio of old men were well aware of the affair . The summer season reversed the roles : Howard became the married partner , and the challenge was to keep the affair secret from his wife . 
 The summer season proved to be a success and frequently played to packed houses . In 1985 , the show was once again produced , first as a two @-@ week tour of Britain , and then as another summer season in Bournemouth . Fergusson returned for the second summer season , once again playing Marina . Robert Fyfe replaced Waller in the role of Howard , and Juliette Kaplan took the role of Pearl for this season . Although the new characters were not originally intended to be carried over to the television programme , Roy Clarke included them in four of the following six episodes of the 1985 series , beginning with the episode " Catching Digby 's Donkey " . All three characters remained until the end of the sitcom . 
 An amended version of the show toured across Britain in 1987 . Sallis was reluctant to appear in the new production , and his role in the show was rewritten and played by Derek <unk> . Because Owen was the only member of the television show 's trio to appear in the production , it was retitled Compo Plays Cupid . Once again , the summer season was a success . 
 A new stage adaptation of the show debuted in 2003 . Based on Clarke 's novel The Moonbather , the play was first performed by the Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club from 7 to 11 October 2003 . Using new actors to perform the roles of Compo , Clegg , and Foggy , the play featured the trio as they attempted to get to the bottom of the disturbance created by a near @-@ naked man in the town . The play was later performed in Eastbourne by Eastbourne Theatres from 15 July 2009 to 8 August 2009 before touring the country through November 2009 . 
 In 2010 , it was announced that long @-@ time supporting cast members Ken Kitson and Louis Emerick would spin their characters off into their own stage adaptation , titled An Arresting Night . Kitson and Emerick , who appeared together on Last of the Summer Wine as Police Constables Cooper and Walsh from 2003 to 2010 , reprised their roles in an improvised stage play . While some elements of the series will be used , the majority of the play was improvised , with Kitson and Emerick each deriving their cues of what to do from the audience . The play was successfully performed in Holmfirth , after which dates were announced in Emerick 's hometown on the Wirral Peninsula .

 Coronet Books released a novelisation of Last of the Summer Wine in 1974 . Written by Roy Clarke as an unbroadcast original story , the novel featured Compo , Clegg and Blamire helping their friend , Sam , enjoy one last night with a glam girl . The book became the basis for the Last of the Summer Wine film , " Getting Sam Home " , with Blamire being replaced by Foggy . In the late 1980s , Roy Clarke wrote novels featuring Compo , Clegg and Seymour . The books were published by Penguin Books under the series heading Summer Wine Chronicles , and included such titles as Gala Week and The Moonbather . Clarke later adapted The Moonbather into a stage play . 
 In the early 1980s , a daily comic strip based on the show was drawn by Roger Mahoney and appeared in the Daily Star . A compilation of these strips , published by Express Books , was released in 1983 . 
 In 1993 , the Summer Wine Appreciation Society asked their members for their favourite musical themes from Last of the Summer Wine . Ronnie Hazlehurst used the resulting list for an independently released CD collection , which was released under the name Last of the Summer Wine : Music from the TV Show . BBC Radio released audio @-@ only versions of episodes starting in 1995 . Peter Sallis provided narration to compensate for the loss of the televised visual elements . All twelve audio episodes were released in CD format . 
 In 1976 , a selection of early scripts from the series was published as Last of the Summer Wine Scripts . A companion guide to the show , Last of the Summer Wine : The Finest Vintage , was released in 2000 . The book was written by Morris Bright and Robert Ross and chronicled the show from its inception through the end of the 2000 series . Included were interviews with cast and crew , a character guide , and an episode guide . Both the companion guide and its updated 30th anniversary version are now out of print . A release by journalist Andrew Vine titled Last of the Summer Wine : The Inside Story of the World 's Longest @-@ running Comedy Programme covered the entire series , including the story of the final words of the series . It was released on 16 August 2010 . On 5 November 2012 , a new book entitled " Last Of the Summer Wine : From The Directors Chair " was released and was written by producer and director Alan J.W. Bell .

 During its first series , Last of the Summer Wine did not receive a high ratings share . The second series proved to be a success , however , and two episodes made it to the top ten programmes of the week . The programme has since consistently been a favourite in the ratings , peaking at 18 @.@ 8 million viewers for an episode shown on 10 February 1985 . The premiere of the 28th series in 2007 brought in an 18 @.@ 6 percent share of viewers in the 6 : 20 time slot with an average of 3 @.@ 2 million viewers . Last of the Summer Wine 's audience grew from 2 @.@ 7 million to 3 @.@ 4 million over the 30 minutes . The show was beaten for the night only by Channel 4 's Big Brother with 3 @.@ 6 million viewers at 9 : 00 p.m. , although the reality show had a smaller share of viewers for its time slot . The 29th series finale , which was broadcast on 31 August 2008 , was watched by 4 @.@ 2 million people , giving the network a 22 @.@ 5 % share for the night .

 Several members of the royal family are viewers of Last of the Summer Wine . While presenting an OBE to Roy Clarke in 2002 , Prince Charles said that his grandmother , the Queen Mother , had introduced him to the show . The Queen told Dame Thora Hird during a 2001 meeting that Last of the Summer Wine was her favourite television programme . 
 A 2003 survey by Radio Times found that Last of the Summer Wine was the programme readers most wanted to see cancelled . With nearly 12 @,@ 000 votes in the survey , the show received one @-@ third of the total vote , and twice as many votes as the runner up in the poll , Heartbeat . Alan J. W. Bell responded that Radio Times has always been anti @-@ Last of the Summer Wine , and Roy Clarke remarked that people who dislike the show " shouldn 't switch it on " unless they are " too idle to turn it off " . A 2008 survey by County Life magazine , which named the show the worst thing about Yorkshire , was disputed by members of the Holme Valley Business Association , who said the show was good for business . However , many members of the Holme Valley Business Association are proprietors of tea rooms that cater primarily to coach parties of elderly fans of the show . The BBC wanted to cancel Last of the Summer Wine for years in favour of a new programme aimed at a younger audience , but the show remained too popular for cancellation ; even repeats received ratings of as much as five million viewers per episode . The show came 14th in a high @-@ profile 2004 BBC poll to find Britain 's Best Sitcom , and was praised for portraying older people in a non @-@ stereotypical , positive , and active manner . It was also praised for its clever and at times philosophical writing , and for being a family @-@ friendly show . 
 Last of the Summer Wine was nominated numerous times for two British television industry awards . The show was proposed five times between 1973 and 1985 for the British Academy Film Awards , twice for the Best Situation Comedy Series award ( in 1973 and 1979 ) and three times for the Best Comedy Series award ( in 1982 , 1983 , and 1985 ) . The show was also been considered for the National Television Awards four times since 1999 ( in 1999 , 2000 , 2003 , and 2004 ) , each time in the Most Popular Comedy Programme category . In 1999 the show won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme .

 Yasunori Mitsuda ( <unk> <unk> , Mitsuda Yasunori , born January 21 , 1972 ) is a Japanese composer , musician , and sound producer known for his work in video games and other media . He is best known for his compositions for the video games Chrono Trigger , Xenogears , Mario Party , Chrono Cross , Xenosaga Episode I , Soma Bringer , Shadow Hearts , Inazuma Eleven , and Soul Sacrifice . 
 Mitsuda began composing video game music for his own games in high school , and after graduation attended Junior College of Music in Tokyo . As part of his college course , he was granted an intern position at Wolf Team , studying under composer and musician Motoi Sakuraba , and was subsequently given special thanks in the credits of one of their games , Span of Dream , in 1990 . Upon graduation in 1992 , he joined Square as a composer after seeing a magazine advertisement in an office he was visiting with his professor . 
 Despite his job title as a composer , Mitsuda worked as a sound effects designer for two years . In 1994 , after threatening to quit to Square 's vice president , Hironobu Sakaguchi , he was assigned to compose the soundtrack to Chrono Trigger . After the game 's success and the music 's acclaim , he went on to compose several other games for Square , including Xenogears . In 1998 , Mitsuda left Square to work as a freelance composer , founding his own music production studio , Procyon Studio , in 2001 as well as his own record label , Sleigh Bells . The company has since expanded to six employees , and Mitsuda continues to compose for video games , as well as for anime series and his own independent albums . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Mitsuda was born in <unk> , Yamaguchi , Japan , on January 21 , 1972 , and was raised in <unk> District . He took piano lessons beginning at the age of five , but he was more interested in sports and never took music seriously , quitting by the age of six . For a while , he wanted to become a professional golfer . While in high school , Mitsuda rediscovered music , inspired by Vangelis ' Blade Runner and Henry Mancini 's The Pink Panther film scores . After watching <unk> , he decided to become a music composer . He became interested in PCs after his father bought him one , which was a rare item at the time . He started to program computer games and compose music for them , as well as take more technically oriented classes . 
 After high school , Mitsuda decided to leave town and become independent . With encouragement from his father and sister , he moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Junior College of Music . Despite the school 's low prestige , Mitsuda received solid instruction from his professors , most of them practicing musicians who would take Mitsuda to gigs with them to help carry and set up equipment . At the cost of being used for free physical labor , Mitsuda got a first @-@ hand view of the Japanese music world and valuable training both in and out of the classroom . He also during his time at the school worked for six months as an assistant to one of the professors at a video game sound department . 
 During this work experience , with his school term ending , Mitsuda saw an advertisement for a sound producer at Square in a copy of Famitsu magazine at a game company he was visiting . With no clear plans as to what he wanted to do after school , he applied for the position . Mitsuda sent a demo which won him an interview at the game studio . Despite the self @-@ described " disastrous " interview with composer Nobuo Uematsu and sound programmer Minoru Akao , in which he claimed to only want the job as a " stepping stone " in his career and admitted that he had never played many of Square 's biggest games , such as the Final Fantasy series , Mitsuda was offered a position on the company 's sound team in April 1992 . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 Although his official job title was " composer " , Mitsuda found himself working more as a sound engineer . Over the next two years , he created sound effects for Hanjuku Hero , Final Fantasy V , Secret of Mana and Romancing SaGa 2 . In 1994 , realizing that he would never get a chance to move up to a real composition duty without some drastic action and feeling concerned about his low pay , he gave Square 's vice president , Hironobu Sakaguchi , an ultimatum : let him compose , or he would quit . Sakaguchi assigned the young musician to the team working on Chrono Trigger , telling him that " after you finish it , maybe your salary will go up " . Mitsuda was assigned as the sole composer for the game , in the end creating 54 tracks for the final release . Mitsuda drove himself to work hard on the score , frequently working until he passed out , and would awake with ideas for songs such as the ending theme for the game . He worked so hard that he developed stomach ulcers and had to be hospitalized , which led Uematsu to offer to finish the remaining tracks for him ; Uematsu ended up composing ten tracks , with one track by Noriko Matsueda . 
 Chrono Trigger proved a great success , and the soundtrack proved extremely popular with fans . Mitsuda claims that it is his " landmark " title , which " matured " him and his music . He attributes its success with fans to his use of folk and jazz styling , rather than the " semi @-@ orchestral " style popular in game music at the time . Following Chrono Trigger , Mitsuda composed the soundtrack for Front Mission : Gun Hazard , again with Uematsu . According to Uematsu , Mitsuda again worked so much that he eventually defecated blood out of stress and physical problems . Mitsuda worked on three more titles for Square : Tobal No. 1 ( Square 's first PlayStation game ) and Radical Dreamers : Nusumenai Hōseki both in 1996 , and Xenogears in 1998 , which featured the first ballad in a Square game , the Celtic ending theme " Small Two of Pieces " sung by Joanne Hogg . Mitsuda also during this period produced albums of arranged music of his original scores , creating acid jazz remixes in Chrono Trigger Arranged Version : The Brink of Time and a Celtic arrangement album of Xenogears music , Creid . In July 1998 , following up on what he had said in his original interview with the company , Mitsuda left Square to work as a freelance composer , the first of several of Square 's composers to do so . 
 Following his leaving , Mitsuda has only worked on one more original game with Square , composing for 1999 's Chrono Cross , the sequel to Chrono Trigger . He has worked on over a dozen games since then , including the spiritual sequel to Xenogears , Xenosaga Episode I : Der Wille zur Macht , and major titles such as Shadow Hearts and Luminous Arc . In addition to video games , Mitsuda has composed music for the anime Inazuma Eleven and for the independent album Kirite . On November 22 , 2001 , Mitsuda formed Procyon Studio as a company to produce his music , along with a record label , Sleigh Bells . The company consisted of only Mitsuda as composer along with a few sound producers for several years , but has since expanded to include six employees . Mitsuda and Procyon Studio have also produced more arranged albums , such as Sailing to the World and 2009 's Colours of Light , a compilation album of vocal pieces Mitsuda has composed . The studio was also involved in co @-@ designing the KORG DS @-@ 10 synthesizer program for the Nintendo DS , and its successor for the Nintendo 3DS , KORG <unk> . Mitsuda claims that , for the projects Procyon has been working on for the past few years , he has been focusing more on working as a music producer for a team of artists rather than just as a composer . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Mitsuda claims to compose by " just fool [ ing ] around on my keyboard " and letting the melodies come to him . He also sometimes comes up with songs while asleep , including the ending theme to Chrono Trigger and " Bonds of Sea and Fire " from Xenogears , though his main inspiration is visual items , " paintings or other things " . His music is frequently minimalistic , and he has cited <unk> as an influence . His final battle themes for Chrono Trigger and Xenogears are based on only a few chords each , with the latter containing only two . Mitsuda has listened to a great number of musical genres throughout his life , which he learned from his father , and is especially inspired by jazz music . He is also inspired by Celtic music , and has created two albums of music in that style . His soundtrack for Chrono Trigger also shows the influence of Asian music , including the sounds of Japanese shakuhachi flutes , Indian tabla drums and the sitar . He has cited Maurice Ravel , J.S. Bach , Pyotr Tchaikovsky , Claude Debussy , Robert Schumann , Antonín Dvořák , and Gustav Holst as his favorite Classical composers , claiming that his modern influences are too numerous to name as he listens to so much music . 
 Mitsuda names his favorite works as the soundtracks to the Chrono series , Xenogears , Xenosaga Episode I , and the original album Kirite , though he also says that all of his soundtracks are " representational works " , as they represent who he was as a composer when he made them . His favorite pieces overall are " The Girl Who Closed Her Heart " and " Pain " from Xenosaga Episode I and pieces from Kirite . When he starts to compose a soundtrack , he first takes one month to gather information and artwork about the game world and scenario , so that his music will fit in with the game . He also finds it easier to be inspired if he has a visual representation . Mitsuda claims that he does not save his best work for more popular games , as he tries to compose each piece to correspond to how it is going to be used in a specific game . He also tries to compose good pieces even for games he feels do not live up to them , so that they will be a redeeming point about the game for the players . The majority of his video game soundtracks are for role @-@ playing games , but he likes projects that are different from what he has done before and is interested in working in other genres . 
 I think [ game music ] is something that should last with the player . It 's interesting because it can 't just be some random music , but something that can make its way into the player 's heart . In that sense , this not only applies to game music , but I feel very strongly about composing songs that will leave a lasting impression ... What I must not forget is that it must be entertaining to those who are listening . I don 't think there 's much else to it , to be honest . I don 't do anything too audacious , so as long as the listeners like it , or feel that it 's a really great song , then I 've done my job .

 Mitsuda 's music from Chrono Trigger was first performed live by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra in 1996 at the Orchestral Game Concert in Tokyo , Japan , and released on an accompanying album . The first symphonic performance of his music outside Japan took place in 2005 at the Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig , Germany when music from Chrono Cross was presented . Mitsuda has arranged versions of music from Trigger and Cross for Play ! A Video Game Symphony video game music concerts in 2006 . Music from the two games has also been performed in other video game concert tours such as the Video Games Live concert series and in concerts by the Eminence Orchestra . Music written by Yasunori Mitsuda for Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross made up one fourth of the music of the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in September 2009 which were produced by the creators of the Symphonic Game Music Concert series and conducted by Arnie Roth . " Scars of Time " from Chrono Cross was played at the Fantasy Comes Alive concert in Singapore on April 30 , 2010 . 
 Mitsuda 's music for Xenogears has also sparked fan @-@ made albums ; an officially licensed tribute album titled Xenogears Light : An Arranged Album , was published in limited quantities by the fan group OneUp Studios in 2005 . The album features 20 tracks arranged from the Xenogears score and performed with acoustic instruments , such as piano , flute , guitar and violin . Another , unofficial album of remixes titled Humans + Gears was produced as a digital album by OverClocked Remix on October 19 , 2009 , consisting of 33 tracks on two " discs " . Selections of remixes of Mitsuda 's work also appear on Japanese remix albums , called Dōjin , and on English remixing websites such as OverClocked Remix . Music from the Chrono Trigger soundtrack has been arranged for the piano and published as sheet music by DOREMI Music Publishing . Sheet music for Chrono Cross tracks arranged for both solo guitar and guitar duets has been released by Procyon Studio . 
 For the 20th anniversary of Chrono Trigger in 2015 , Mitsuda , along with his performing group Millennial Fair , performed songs from the game at the Tokyo Globe in Tokyo , Japan on July 25 and 26 . The event , titled " The Brink of Time " , included Mitsuda performing on the piano , guitar , and Irish bouzouki . During the event , Mitsuda also announced that the long requested Chrono series arrangement album , entitled To Far Away Times : Chrono Trigger & Chrono Cross Arrangement Album , would be released by Square Enix Music on October 14 , 2015 . 
 Mitsuda 's music has been heavily remixed by fans , sparking several albums . These include the officially licensed Time & Space – A Tribute to Yasunori Mitsuda , released by OneUp Studios on October 7 , 2001 , and containing 18 remixes , with a second version of the album released on June 17 , 2003 . Another popular album release was Chrono Symphonic , an unofficial download @-@ only album release by the remix website OverClocked ReMix on January 3 , 2006 , containing 25 remixes over 2 " discs " . A related popular album release was Radical Dreamers : Thieves of Fate , an unofficial download @-@ only album release by the OverClocked ReMix on January 5 , 2008 , containing 15 remixes of the soundtrack to Radical Dreamers .

 = Oslo Metro rolling stock = 
 The rolling stock of Oslo Metro , Norway has consisted of three classes : T1000 / T1300 , T2000 and MX3000 . The T1000 was built as 162 single cars from 1964 to 1978 . From 1979 to 1985 , 33 new T1300 trains were built , followed by the conversion of 16 T1000s . Six two @-@ car T2000 units were delivered in 1994 . Since 2005 , the first 83 three @-@ car MX3000 units have been replacing the older stock , and the last T1000 was retired in 2007 . From 2010 , only MX3000 @-@ trains are in use . The T1000 / T1300 and T2000 were built by Strømmens Værksted , with motors from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri ( NEBB ) and AEG , respectively , and the MX3000 were built by Siemens . 
 All trains receive 750 V DC from a third rail shoe , while the T1300 and T2000 also have pantographs . This allows the latter to also operate on the suburban lines of the Oslo Tramway , which the western part of the current metro was part of until 1995 . All trains feature automatic train protection and step @-@ free access from the platforms . Trains can operate up to six cars in length . The T1000 / T1300 and MX3000 are capable of 70 kilometres per hour ( 43 mph ) , while the T2000 can operate at 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) . The T2000 introduced articulated cars , while the MX3000 introduced regenerative brakes and air conditioning . The T1000 / T1300 and MX3000 can be run in multiple with each other , but not with the T2000 . The MX3000 replaced the red color scheme with a white livery . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1954 , the Oslo City Council decided to build a four @-@ line metro to the new suburbs to the east of the city center . The plans called for the system to open in 1966 , with the conversion of the Østensjø Line and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway , and the new Furuset Line and Grorud Line . The system would feature higher and longer platforms , allowing step @-@ free access to six @-@ car trains , automatic train protection and third @-@ rail power supply . This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways in Oslo . The first units in the T1000 series were two single @-@ car prototypes designated T. They were test @-@ run on the existing tramways from 1959 to 1960 , and were then put into service on the Kolsås Line . Prone to technical faults , they were taken out of regular service in 1982 . 
 Serial production of the T1000 started in 1964 by Strømmens Værksted , NEBB and AEG . Until 1978 , 162 cars were delivered to Oslo Sporveier . These were manufactured in four series , designated T1 through T4 , with minor changes to specifications . During the late 1970s , the western suburban lines which were part of the tramway needed new rolling stock . Oslo Sporveier was at the time considering connecting the metro with these lines , and between 1978 and 1981 , 33 new T1300 cars were built . The only difference from the T1000 was that they had a pantograph that allowed them to operate on the tramways . They also retained the necessary technical appliances to run on the metro . The new T1300 were designated T5 and T6 . From 1985 to 1989 , 16 T4s were rebuilt to T1300 and designated T7 and T8 . 
 Oslo Sporveier was highly satisfied with the SL79 articulated trams that had been delivered during the 1980s . In 1985 , work started on the development of a modified version for the western suburban lines . The stock on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines were the first that needed to be replaced . At the same time , the company wanted to make the trains compatible with the metro so they could operate on both systems . The new stock was considered to be a trial ; if it met performance expectations , future orders could be made to replace the T1000 stock , after the latter reached the end of its economical life in about 2000 . The required specification for the new train was published in October 1988 . 
 In the late 1980s , it was decided to upgrade the Røa and Sognsvann Lines to metro standard . This would allow them to use T1000 stock . Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991 , and would be sufficient to operate the services on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines , that would retain an overhead wire . The development costs for the T2000 were in part subsidized by the government , as the high @-@ tech product from Strømmens Verksted ( by then part of the ABB Group ) and AEG was seen as a future export product . The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995 . The same year , the metro started operating all services through the city center , connecting the western and eastern networks . 
 In 1996 , the work to establish a financing package for new investments in public transport in Akershus and Oslo started . Oslo Package 2 was passed in 2001 and allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and toll road revenue to finance , among other things , new trains for the metro . The initial order by Oslo Sporveier in 2003 from Siemens was for 33 units ( 99 cars ) , plus options for further orders . In 2005 , the city council voted to replace all existing T1000 and T1300 stock with the MX3000 , increasing the quantity by another 30 units . Two test units were delivered in October 2005 , with the first serial deliveries in April 2007 . With the delivery of the new white and gray trains , Oslo Sporveier received criticism that they had been disloyal to the old red color of the metro , and that they did not follow up on their former design concept from the 1960s through the 1980s . Following the 2006 decision to convert the Kolsås Line to metro standard , Akershus County Municipality announced they would order five units . 
 In November 2006 , the city government proposed that the maintenance of the new trains be privatized . This resulted in protests from the employees , who campaigned by refusing to work overtime . As a result , after a few weeks , the company lacked 57 trains to provide adequate service . The issue was solved when the socialist opposition parties along with the Liberal Party agreed to postpone the matter until after all the new trains were delivered in 2009 . As part of the agreement , a new limited company , Oslo Vognselskap , wholly owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon , would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by the operating companies . Responsibility for the debt accumulated for buying the trains is to be managed by Oslo Vognselskap , while operation and management of the maintenance contracts was transferred to Oslo T @-@ banedrift . 
 In 2008 , the city council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to metro standard , to allow six @-@ car MX3000 trains to be the main mode of transport to Holmenkollen Ski Jump during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011 . This will allow 9 @,@ 000 people per hour to be transported to the sports venue . The first T1000 was scrapped on 14 March 2007 , and the last T1000 train was run on 19 July 2009 . Oslo Tramway Museum has preserved six T1000 cars , no . 1002 ( T1 @-@ 2 ) , 1018 ( T1 @-@ 2 ) , 1076 ( T1 @-@ 1 ) , 1092 ( T2 ) , 1129 ( T3 ) and 1141 ( T4 ) . In 2008 , the T2000 were taken out of service while the Holmenkollen Line was being renovated . In 2010 , <unk> decided that they would not put back into service , largely because of high maintenance costs and low availability of spare parts because of the technically complex design and small series . The last T1300 was retired on 22 May 2010 , after which only MX3000 units are used on the metro . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The Oslo Metro uses 750 volt direct current fed to the train via a third rail , along a standard gauge track . The system is not compatible to the Oslo Tramway , but the T1300 and T2000 have been built to run on both the suburban lines of the tramway and the metro . The platforms are 110 metres ( 360 ft ) long , and the height of the train floors are 1 @.@ 12 meters ( 3 ft 8 in ) above the track , allowing step @-@ free access to the platforms . 
 The trains ' speed are controlled by an automatic train protection ( ATP ) system . The speed codes are transferred from the ATP points in the infrastructure , using 75 hertz pulses in the tracks . The trains pick up the signals via antennas . The speed codes are 15 km / h ( 9 mph ) , 30 km / h ( 19 mph ) , 50 km / h ( 31 mph ) and 70 km / h ( 43 mph ) . They are communicated to the engineer via signals in the driver 's cab ; in addition , the system will automatically reduce the speed , should the limit be exceeded . The driver can put the trains in an automatic mode , where the train itself adjusts its speed to the limit . The driver is always responsible for starting and halting the train at stations .

 The MX3000 introduced a number of technical innovations to the metro . Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail . The passengers also have air conditioning . The driver 's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models , and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens . The trains ' livery is white with gray detailing , instead of the former models ' red with blue detailing . For use in areas without a third rail , such as at depots , the trains are equipped with a 110 V battery . This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs . 
 = Polistes exclamans = 
 Polistes exclamans is a social wasp and is part of the family Vespidae of the order Hymenoptera . It is found throughout the United States , Mexico , the Bahamas and parts of Canada . Due to solitary nest founding by queens , P. exclamans has extended its range in the past few decades and now covers the eastern half of the United States , as well as part of the north . This expansion is typically attributed to changing global climate and temperatures . P. exclamans has three specific castes , including males , workers , and queens , but the dominance hierarchy is further distinguished by age . The older the wasp is , the higher it is in ranking within the colony . In most P. exclamans nests , there is one queen who lays all the eggs in the colony . The physiological similarities between the worker and queen castes have led to experiments attempting to distinguish the characteristics of these two castes and how they are determined , though males have easily identifiable physiological characteristics . Since P. exclamans live in relatively small , open combed nests , they are often subject to predators and parasites , such as Chalcoela iphitalis , Elasmus <unk> , and birds . P. exclamans have defense and recognition strategies that help protect against these predators and parasites . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 Polistes exclamans is part of subfamily Polistinae within the hymenopteran family Vespidae . Polistinae ( paper wasps ) is the second largest of six vespid subfamilies , containing around 950 species , and is composed entirely of social wasps . It is made up of four tribes ; P. exclamans is part of <unk> . Genus Polistes is currently split into four subgenera that are distributed across the world ; P. exclamans is a part of the New World subgenus <unk> and is most closely related to P. annularis , P. <unk> , P. canadensis , P. <unk> , P. <unk> , P. <unk> , P. crinitus , P. versicolor , and P. <unk> . 
 = = Description and identification = = 
 There are two forms of Polistes exclamans in the United States : typical and variable . The typical form is found in south @-@ eastern United States and inhabits the following states : North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama Florida , Texas , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Arkansas , Kansas , Colorado , and Arizona . Although this form ’ s color can vary , it almost always has some yellow coloring . Both the propodeum and the mesonotum are marked with yellow . The propodeum normally has four yellow stripes , whereas the mesonotum has yellow lines . It also may have yellow markings on its head . The wings , however , are not yellow in color or yellow tinged like some other wasps but are <unk> and purple in color . The typical form often can be confused with Polistes fuscatus , Polistes crinitus , or Polistes minor . The variable form is red @-@ brown in coloring . The middle of the flagellum , the base of the abdominal segments , and the outer side of the mid and hind tibiae are <unk> or black colored , as are the wings . Instead of yellow markings , the variable form has pale ivory @-@ white markings that are dispersed throughout the body . P. exclamans have antennae banded with red , black and yellow , while most paper wasps only have one antennae color . In females , the fore wing length can range from 13 @.@ 0 to 16 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 51 – 0 @.@ 65 in ) and in males the fore wings can range from 12 @.@ 0 to 15 @.@ 0 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 – 0 @.@ 59 in ) . The extent of ferruginous markings is variable . 
 Although no distinguishing structural features have been found to separate the workers and queens , the male is easily identified by its bulging eyes , <unk> clypeus , and slender antennae . P. exclamans males are also more variable in external morphology compared to females . This is possible given the male ’ s <unk> ( females are homozygous ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Polistes exclamans is distributed throughout the United States in the following areas and states : New Jersey down to Florida , Florida to Texas , west to Nebraska , Colorado , Arizona , and California . It has also been found in Mexico and the Bahamas . It has also been observed in Ontario , Canada as well . 
 As a vespid wasp , P. exclamans nests are typically made up of paper with a single layer of cells with open combs . Although nest size varies , the upper limit is around 500 cells . Although many vespid wasps have an outer envelope of paper , P. exclamans nests do not . As indicated by Strassmann and <unk> , “ Nests are approximately circular , and have a single off @-@ center pedicel usually located towards the top of the nest . Cells near the pedicle are the oldest . ” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories . P. exclamans have often been found to have nests located near man @-@ made structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these man @-@ made structures . Out of six wasp species , P. exclamans was the only one that occupied artificial nesting sites . It prefers well @-@ lit , open sites . 
 Polistes nests can be built from wood fiber which are collected from posts and plant stems . The fiber is formed into a paper like comb with hexagonal cells . The nests are orientated downward and are held up by one filament . P. exclamans have also been observed occupying artificial nests put out by researchers and consisting of bundles of straws . 
 = = Colony cycle = = 
 The colony cycle of Polistes exclamans is longer than that of northern wasp species , shorter than that of tropical wasp species and as such is in “ some respects intermediate between ” the two . Their cycle occurs between March and September . The first brood of workers emerges between May and July . It takes about nine to fourteen days for eggs to develop , though eggs in smaller nests and that are laid later in the season take much longer to develop : about thirteen to eighteen days for larva to develop , about thirteen days for pupa to develop , and about a total of six to eight weeks for an egg to develop into an adult . Reproductive wasps emerge later in August or September . 
 = = The queen = = 
 = = = Queen characteristics = = = 
 P. exclamans lives in a hierarchical society with one queen that lays the eggs . However , all of the females have the same morphology and they all have the physiological capability of taking over the egg laying if necessary ( queen death , queen migration ) . Since the queen has the same morphology as the rest of the workers in the colony , this raises the question as to how the queen role is assigned and what makes her special . Studies have found that queens and males have higher levels of glucose , fructose and trehalose than workers , leading to higher cryoprotectant levels . P. exclamans use these sugars as cryoprotectant , which work by increasing the solute concentration in cells . This results in a greater survivability in colder weather . It was found that queens have a 76 % survival rate in 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) weather compared to 17 % survival of the workers over a 15 @-@ day test period . The queens also have a <unk> layer of fat surrounding their bodies . This allows them to live longer into the winter and possibly extend their mating season . The queens seem to be the only ones capable of diapause . 
 = = = Queen development and determination = = = 
 While there aren ’ t many external morphological differences between queens and workers there are some internal traits that can be signals of a wasp ’ s social status . It has also been found that caste determination is irreversibly determined by temperature during the immature stages of development . In one experiment , some wasps emerging in June were kept in long day chambers , or chambers set at 26 ° C with 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness . These individuals had larger and more active ovaries as compared to those who were incubated in short day chambers , which are set at 22 ° C with 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness . It is thought that this phenomenon may occur because of a juvenile hormone secretion that determines the castes and a suppression of the workers ’ ovaries by environmental or hormonal factors . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Given that Polistes exclamans nests are often destroyed or suffer through the death of the queen ( most often through natural circumstances ) , it is necessary and adaptive for there to be a specific system for the replacement of the queen . The current system in place can best “ be described as gerontocracy . ” Furthermore , it is also closely related to the dominance system within the colony as well . In the dominance hierarchy , older individuals are higher in rank , whereas younger individuals serve in the lower ranks . These older female workers are generally more aggressive and forage more frequently . In reflection of this dominance ranking and the behavior of the female workers , it is seen that when a queen is no longer present in the colony , the next eldest worker becomes the new queen . This may be due to the genetics of the next eldest queen , as the replacement queen affects the overall relatedness of the females in the brood , thereby allowing the future brood to be more related to the adult workers rearing them . 
 = = = The queen 's role = = = 
 Unlike other wasps , P. exclamans tend to have smaller nests , with typically fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest . Because of the size of the nest , the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest . This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest . In addition to her reproductive role , the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and synchronize the worker activity . These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized . It has also been observed that the queen will act aggressively towards individuals that are the least active . 
 = = Development and reproduction = = 
 = = = Sex determination system = = = 
 P. exclamans are haplodiploid insects , as are other Polistes species including Polistes <unk> , Polistes <unk> , and Polistes annularis . This means they have haploid males that produce identical haploid sperm , and diploid females that produce haploid eggs through meiosis . This has consequences for genetic relatedness within colonies , since sisters receive identical sperm if they share a father , and the normal half identical contribution from the mother . This results in sex @-@ biased conflicts between the queen and the workers with respect to the sex ratio , with workers preferring a more female biased sex ratio , and queens preferring equal investment in queens and males . 
 = = = Sexual investment = = = 
 In Polistes exclamans , equal sex ratio is obtained when only 46 @.@ 3 % of investment is devoted to females as female wasps are 1 @.@ 16 times larger than male wasps . In a study done by Strassmann , it was found that sexual investment is female biased , especially during years of high predation and when nests are generally less successful . It has been seen that in Polistes exclamans , females are produced before males . This female investment bias may result from the ability of females to become either a worker or a reproductive ( this is more adaptive for the nest as it gives the nest increased flexibility compared to that of males and may be important for overall nest success ) or because females provide the colony with greater nest defense . Furthermore , even when the original queen is no longer present , the sexual investment is still biased towards females , which is not expected given the genetic implications of a new queen . 
 = = = Early males = = = 
 Workers first emerge between May and July . During this first emergence , reproductive males also emerge with this first brood and are called the early males . These males provide a great adaptation because they allow for the presence of reproductive males . Nests with a greater number of early males produce a greater number of workers , cells , pupae , and <unk> . Although it is uncertain as to why , queen deaths are common in Polistes exclamans , most frequently in May . The majority of original queens are dead by July , “ well before eggs that became autumn reproductive were laid , ” as reproductives emerged from late August through September . Thus , queens must remain alive post June in order to birth future reproductives , and if they are not able to do so , the eldest former worker then becomes the new queen . The reproductive early males produced may be adaptive for the deaths of the queens so that the colony will not die and will be able to continue . 
 = = = Sexual attraction = = = 
 As with many other insects , P. exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the opposite sex . Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps . They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females . These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and <unk> of unmated females . The male extracts were taken from the ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands . It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on . The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres . 
 In nature , it was observed that males would venture away from the nest in order to attract females . The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it . This is used to attract females , and females were observed to visit these branches and sample the scents . Interestingly , it was also found that on some occasions , males were attracted to other male scents . 
 = = Behavior and ecology = = 
 = = = Presence of brood and caste differentiation = = = 
 Polistes exclamans have comparably smaller nests and colonies compared to certain other eusocial wasps species . Thus , it is common for the nest to be destroyed , for the queen to die prior to the end of the season , or for the nest to fail through other means , such as predation , <unk> , or worker mortality , leading workers to help rear broods that are less related to them than are their sister wasps . Due to this , it would be advantageous for there to be wasps that remain <unk> till adulthood , allowing female wasps ’ reproductive capabilities to be plastic . It has thus been predicted that Polistes exclamans worker wasps would act as workers if a brood were present and would begin to develop gyne characteristics if a brood was not present , exhibiting the aforementioned adaptive plasticity . Experimentally , this has been found to be true . Solis and Strassmann conducted a study in which an experimental group had the eggs and larvae removed . In the experimental group , the wasps began to behave like future queens and even developed the characteristic layer of fat common to queens . In the control group , the wasps continued to behave as workers . This is indicative that the presence of the brood affects caste differentiation and that Polistes exclamans female workers exhibits adaptive reproductive plasticity . 
 = = = <unk> recognition = = = 
 Nest mate recognition is widespread in many eusocial insects . However , when there are no physical differences in either diet or nesting materials , many can no longer discriminate nest mate from other conspecifics . Recently , however , it has been indicated that many insects have the ability to discriminate relatives even having lived in identical environments with their non @-@ relative counterpart . Studies have indicated that in Polistes fuscatus , former nestmates would nest in areas located close together near their natal nests the following spring . Social halictid bees also are able to recognize their relatives . In Polistes exclamans , it has been indicated that discrimination of relatives from non @-@ relatives , even having lived in identical environments , is possible . This was found by Allen , Schulze Kellman , and Gamboa through an experiment in which hibernating wasps from different nests were put in a box together after being raised in identical environments . As the number of unrelated groups of wasps increased , the more clumps were formed in the box . This indicates that the wasps were capable of differentiating relative from <unk> , an adaptive ability in the defense of their nest . 
 = = = Hibernation = = = 
 Many Polistes species aggregate over winter . Polistes exclamans clump in rather large aggregations while hibernating . “ These aggregations are frequently found in protected places called hibernacula that can be as varied as crevices and cracks of rocks or trunks , beneath the bark of trees , between walls of buildings , or any other natural or artificial structures that provides protection during hibernation . ” Although Polistes exclamans have been found in organ @-@ pipe <unk> nests , a mud nest that can provide a certain level of protection , it is not thought to actually house hibernating Polistes exclamans over the winter . 
 = = = Worker mortality = = = 
 A typical P. exclamans worker will live somewhere between 14 – 16 days . The oldest wasp to be observed in a natural colony was 102 days old . Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers . There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans . This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin . It also must be noted that while there is variation between colonies , there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest . Variation inside a single colony may also occur because of the presence of different castes . Foragers , those who frequently travel outside the nest , lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest . Though , it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy . Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity . This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles . 
 Worker death is an important factor in colony failure , and is the cause of 13 – 76 % of colony failures . This may be in part due to the small colony size . Because the colonies are small , worker longevity is crucial for the survival of the nest . 
 = = = Range Extension = = = 
 Throughout the 1950s and 1960s , Polistes exclamans was extending its range , spreading into the midwestern United States . Between 1958 and 1967 the following states had new state records of Polistes exclamans : Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Maryland , Missouri , New Jersey , New Mexico , Tennessee , and Virginia . The behavioral basis behind range expansion could be based upon the exceptional capability Polistes exclamans has in the colonization of new sites and the solitary nest founding behavior Polistes exclamans exhibits . This capability could be assisted by the “ associated tendencies of P. exclamans foundresses to disperse and to move into newly available nesting sites . ” Meanwhile , species with social foundresses reproduce near the place of origin and , therefore , do not extend their range as far . 
 = = = Satellite nests = = = 
 Satellite nests are common among P. exclamans . A queen will fly somewhere between 0 @.@ 15 and 11m away from the original nest to settle in a new location . About 16 – 39 % of nests create satellites from May to July . Similar to the wasp species , <unk> <unk> , constructing multitude of nests in clusters in order to create protection through dilution effect , the satellites are used as an insurance against attacks by predators and parasitoids . Of 12 nests that were knocked down by birds that had satellites , 66 @.@ 7 % of the colony survived by moving to the satellite , compared to the reproductive success of nests with no satellite that were attacked ( 5 @.@ 7 % ) . When Chalcoela iphitalis invades , the prevalence of satellites didn ’ t increase the survivability , however it did have an effect when Elasmus polistis were introduced . It gave the P. exclamans a place to escape to . 
 Workers who are older typically start satellite nests and have more developed ovaries . Younger and lesser @-@ developed workers join the satellite after its establishment . The distribution of workers between the main nest and satellite is very important because they are needed for the establishment of the satellite and for the continued running of the main nest . Although , after several months the main nest can become abandoned . If not enough workers follow the initial worker to the new nest , then it will most likely fail as a satellite . 
 = = Interaction with other species = = 
 = = = Parasitoids = = = 
 Polistes exclamans live in social nests that are open combed . This leaves nests very susceptible to attacks by predators and by parasitoids . Attack by parasitoids will occur in the nest brood , as the invader will attempt to insert its own offspring into the host ’ s nest . The two most common parasitoids are Chalcoela iphitalis and Elasmus polistis . 
 = = = = C. iphitalis and E. polistis = = = = 
 P. exclamans take several countermeasures against invasions . If the wasps detect an intruder they will violently bite and sting the location where the C. iphitalis moth has passed by . This will cause vibrations inside of the nest and the wasps inside will become alarmed and will move around jerkily . This phenomenon is known as the parasite dance . This will continue for up to 10 hours after the moth has been detected . If the moth is found it will be eaten immediately . However , this is not likely to happen . The moth lays its eggs in the nest , and when they hatch , they will take over the nest . As a result , many wasp pupae are aborted . This is commonly seen in the late summer when the moth is most abundant . 
 The second common parasitoid , Elasmus polistis , also has disastrous effects on the P. exclamans nest . Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell . The males emerge first , and then will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge . Once the female moths emerge , the males will mate and reproduce , quickly destroying the P. exclamans population . In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P. exclamans cannot find them . This is important to the survival of P. exclamans . The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests . This defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective , as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts . In one experiment conducted , it was found that over 60 % of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981 . It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized . This is due to the fact that the large nests are typically older . This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens ’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens ’ nests . 
 = = = Predation = = = 
 P. exclamans has several different predators . Their most dangerous predators are birds , which will fly by and knock the nest to the ground . This phenomenon was discovered by the disappearance of nests , and wasp nests being found on the ground near the bird ’ s nest . It has also been found that birds eat the larvae from the P. exclamans nest . This attack kills the whole nest but it isn ’ t very effective against the adults from the colony . When attacked , the adults fly away either to another colony or a satellite colony . 
 Attack by the ant Crematogaster <unk> is different from attacks by birds . Rather than knocking down the nest , the ants swarm all over the nest and remove the brood from it . The ants destroy the entire brood but they are unable to kill the adults . 
 Other predators attack the adults while they are foraging or traveling to satellite nests . It is difficult to determine the number of adults that are killed away from the nest because they are difficult to track . However , it has been observed that the queen 's flight to the satellite nest isn 't dangerous and does not reduce its survivability . 
 The idea of group living has been discussed by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits . Alexander predicted that the cost to large groups is that they are more likely to suffer from parasitism , but at the same time , they benefit by defense against predation . This theory is not supported in the case of P. exclamans because the parasitism does not always increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size . 
 = = = Colony defense = = = 
 = = = = Facial patterns = = = = 
 Some animals may assess rivals through specific characteristics that are relevant to their fighting abilities ; however , some animals , instead , use conventional characteristics to determine the competitive ability of their rivals . Conventional characteristics are signals that are indicative of the rival ’ s abilities but are not a reflection of the animal ’ s physiological or physical agonistic abilities . Polistes exclamans uses facial patterns as a conventional characteristic to determine the agonistic abilities of competitive rivals . Larger wasps have a greater amount of brown pigmented clypei . Wasps use these pigmented clypei to determine the viability of challenging a rival . The more pigmented the clypei or the larger the Polistes exclamans , the more likely the Polistes exclamans will be willing to challenge a rival . The less pigmented the clypei or the smaller the Polistes exclamans , the less willing it would be to challenge a rival . This assists in the minimization of the “ costs of conflict during dominance competition among nest @-@ founding queens . ” 
 = = = = Alarm response = = = = 
 Polistes exclamans exhibit an alarm response , typical of many higher level eusocial Hymenoptera . Although it has been previously indicated that nest mates may alarm the rest of the nest through jerky movement and buzzing of wings , Polistes exclamans is capable of alarming the rest of the nest and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non @-@ species @-@ specific venomous alarm pheromone . Although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive , the Polistes exclamans only releases a response post the initial attack from and on the predator , as the venom is only released during the sting . This venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby heterospecific or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack the predator . This helps deter the predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for the defense of the nest . Although certain other insects have been able to adapt the release of the pheromone to other means of communicating alarm , Polistes exclamans has yet to do so , indicating that it is still in its “ primitive state in evolution of the complex systems of communication of alarm seen in higher social insects . ” In one experiment , pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper . It was then found that females were attracted upwind of the venom paper and some even attempted to sting it . This also had a heterospecific response where others also reacted to it . While it was found that one wasp couldn ’ t release enough pheromones to elicit a response , if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response from the rest of the nest . However , this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests , and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping . 
 = = = = Queen response = = = = 
 After being invaded , a queen may be forced to leave her nest . If a satellite has not been established , the queen may usurp another queen in a different nest . This gives them protection and a nest without having to invest any valuable resources . The queen can then use these resources on reproducing a new brood . 
 = Bhopal : A Prayer for Rain = 
 Bhopal : A Prayer for Rain is a 2014 historical @-@ drama film set amidst the Bhopal disaster that had occurred in India on 2 – 3 December 1984 . It is directed by Ravi Kumar and features Martin Sheen , Mischa Barton , Kal Penn , Rajpal Yadav , Tannishtha Chatterjee , and <unk> Thakrar in important roles . Benjamin Wallfisch composed the film 's music . Kumar got the idea of making a film based on the Bhopal disaster after he read a book based on it . Shot over a period of 18 months , it was originally slated for a late 2010 release . However , the lack of responses from distributors kept on delaying the release . 
 In April 2013 , a new trailer was released , and the film received a market screening at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival on 16 May and 19 May . It was also screened at Pan Asia , Dingle and the Tokyo International film festivals . Bhopal : A Prayer for Rain was released in the United States on 7 November 2014 and in India on 5 December 2014 . A private screening of the movie was held at the youth assembly in the United Nations on 7 August 2014 . 
 The film received mixed reviews from critics , who praised the actors ' portrayal of their respective characters but called Barton 's character as unnecessary . A few organisations fighting for the rights of the victims of the tragedy blamed the film for presenting the facts in a distorted manner . Kumar and Sheen denied these allegations . The Madhya Pradesh government exempted the film from paying tax . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1984 , a few months before the disaster , Dilip ( Rajpal Yadav ) , a rickshaw driver , loses his pay source as his rickshaw breaks down while transporting an employee to the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal . Dilip lives in the slums around the plant with his wife , a son and his sister . He gets a job in the plant as a labourer , and is happy since his daily wage is restored . 
 The plant witnesses a drop in its revenue due to lower sales of pesticides , and in order to reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance . Questioning the chemicals used in the plant , Motwani ( Kal Penn ) , a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers . Roy ( Joy Sengupta ) , the in @-@ charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns . The officials however ignore his warnings , and a worker is killed when methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipeline drips off on his hand . The officials deem the worker 's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function . Dilip is given a better @-@ paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery . A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate , and in an attempt to stop people from panicking , the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren .
