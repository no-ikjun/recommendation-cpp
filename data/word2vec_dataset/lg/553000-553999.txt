 The National Hockey League came into existence with the suspension of the NHA in 1917 . After unsuccessfully resolving disputes with Eddie Livingstone , owner of the Toronto Blueshirts , executives of the three other NHA franchises — the Montreal Canadiens , Montreal Wanderers and Ottawa Senators — suspended the NHA , and formed the NHL , replacing Livingstone 's team with a temporary team in Toronto , the Arenas . While new , the NHL was a continuation of the NHA . The NHL adopted the NHA 's constitution , its rules , playing with six men to a side rather than the then @-@ traditional seven and the NHA 's split @-@ season schedule . The owners originally intended the NHL to only operate for one season . However , the NHA was suspended permanently in 1918 and ceased to be an organisation in 1920 . In 1921 , the NHA championship trophy O 'Brien Cup was adopted as the championship trophy of the NHL .

 One of the NHL 's first superstars was the prolific goal @-@ scorer Joe Malone , who scored 44 goals in 20 games in the NHL 's first season , of which five were netted on the NHL 's opening night . He also set the record for the most goals in a game that season , with seven . Six games into the season , the Montreal Wanderers were forced to permanently withdraw from the league , as a fire left them without an arena . In the 1918 – 19 season , the Montreal Canadiens faced the Seattle Metropolitans of the PCHA for the Stanley Cup amid the Spanish influenza pandemic . The series was called off after five games when numerous players became ill ; one , Joe Hall of the Canadiens , died a few weeks later . 
 During the early 1920s , the NHL faced competition for players from two other major leagues : the PCHA and the Western Canada Hockey League ( WCHL ) . As a result , ice hockey players were among the best paid athletes in North America . By the mid @-@ 1920s , the NHL emerged as the sole major league in North America ; the PCHA and WCHL having merged in 1924 , only to disband two years later . The Victoria Cougars are the last non @-@ NHL team to win and challenge the Stanley Cup , having defeated the Canadiens in 1925 , and lost to the Montreal Maroons in 1926 , respectively . The NHL continued to expand , adding the Maroons and its first American team , the Boston Bruins in 1924 , getting up to 10 teams by 1926 . Defence dominated the NHL , and in the 1928 – 29 season , Canadiens goaltender George Hainsworth set what remains a league record with 22 shutouts in 44 games . In response , the NHL began to allow forward passing in the offensive zone , which caused the offense to increase by approximately 2 @.@ 5 times ; to stem the tide , the NHL introduced the offside rule , which prevents offensive players to enter the opponent 's zone before the puck crosses the " blue line " . 
 Livingstone continued to press claims in court throughout the 1920s , going as far as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London , England . In early 1927 , the Toronto franchise was sold to Conn Smythe , who renamed it to the Maple Leafs , and successfully promised to win the Stanley Cup in five years . He built the Maple Leaf Gardens , which included radio broadcaster Foster Hewitt 's famous broadcast booth , affectionately referred to as a " gondola " . On December 13 , 1933 , Eddie Shore charged Ace Bailey causing a severe skull fracture , following what Shore thought was a check from Bailey , but was actually made by King Clancy . Despite the grim prognosis ( newspapers printed his obituary ) , Bailey survived , but never played a game . The Maple Leafs hosted the Ace Bailey All @-@ Star Benefit Game , which raised over $ 20 @,@ 000 for Bailey and his family . 
 = = = Great Depression = = = 
 While Conn Smythe was able to successfully build a new arena , numerous other teams experienced financial difficulties . With the folding of the Philadelphia Quakers ( originally the Pittsburgh Pirates ) and the St. Louis Eagles ( originally the Ottawa Senators ) , the NHL was reduced to eight teams starting in the 1935 – 36 season . The Montreal Canadiens narrowly escaped a move to Cleveland , Ohio , before a syndicate of Montreal businessmen bought the team . Montreal 's financial troubles forced them to sell popular player Howie Morenz . When Morenz scored against the Canadiens on the last day of the 1935 season , Montreal fans voiced their opinion , giving him a standing ovation . Morenz was eventually re @-@ acquired by Montreal , and on January 28 , 1937 , Morenz 's skate became caught in the ice during a play . He suffered a broken leg in four places , and died on March 8 of a coronary embolism ; 50 @,@ 000 people filed past Morenz 's casket at centre ice of the Montreal Forum to pay their last respects . A benefit game held in November 1937 raised $ 20 @,@ 000 for Morenz 's family as the NHL All @-@ Stars defeated the Montreal Canadiens 6 – 5 . 
 In the mid @-@ 1930s , Chicago Black Hawks owner and staunch American nationalist Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager to compile a team of only American players ; at the time , Taffy Abel was the only American @-@ born player who was a regular player in the league . With eight out of 14 players Americans , the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games . In the playoffs , however , the Hawks upset the Canadiens , New York Americans , and the Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular @-@ season record . In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals , the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were facing an upset , having fallen 3 – 0 in the seven @-@ game series to the fifth @-@ place Detroit Red Wings . Toronto rebounded , and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup , becoming the first of four teams in the NHL to come back from a 3 – 0 series deficit and the only team to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals . 
 Prior to the 1938 – 39 season , the Montreal Maroons folded due to financial difficulties , while the New York Americans suffered a similar fate prior to the 1942 – 43 season . With the league reduced to six teams , the " Original Six " era began . The league was nearly reduced to five teams before the following season , as World War II had ravaged the rosters of many teams to such an extent that teams battled each other for players . With only five returning players from the previous season , New York Rangers general manager Lester Patrick suggested suspending his team 's play for the duration of the war but was persuaded otherwise .

 In February 1943 , league President Frank Calder collapsed during a meeting , dying shortly after . Red Dutton agreed to take over as president after receiving assurances from the league that the Brooklyn franchise he had operated would resume play after the war . When the other team owners reneged on this promise in 1946 , Dutton resigned as league president . With Dutton 's recommendation , Clarence Campbell was named president of the NHL in 1946 . He remained in that role until his retirement in 1977 . For the first 21 years of his presidency , the same six teams ( located in Boston , Chicago , Detroit , Montreal , New York , and Toronto ) competed for the Stanley Cup and that period has been called the " golden age of hockey " . The NHL featured increasingly intense rivalries coupled with rule innovations that opened up the game . The first official All @-@ Star Game took place at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on October 13 , 1947 to raise money for the newly created NHL Pension Society . The NHL All @-@ Stars defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4 – 3 and raised C $ 25 @,@ 000 for the pension fund . 
 The 1940s Canadiens were led by the " Punch line " of Elmer Lach , Toe Blake and Maurice " Rocket " Richard . In 1944 – 45 , Lach , Richard and Blake finished first , second and third in the NHL 's scoring race with 80 , 73 and 67 points respectively . It was Richard who became the focus of the media and fans as he attempted to score 50 goals in a 50 @-@ game season , a feat no other player had accomplished in league history . Richard scored his 50th goal in Boston at 17 : 45 of the third period of Montreal 's final game of the season . On March 13 , 1948 , Larry Kwong , the " China Clipper " , becomes the first non @-@ white player in the NHL , breaking the colour barrier . He suited up for the New York Rangers against the Montreal Canadiens at the Montreal Forum . In March 1955 , Richard was suspended for the remainder of the season , including the playoffs , after he received a match penalty for slashing Boston 's Hal Laycoe then punching a linesman who attempted to intervene . The suspension touched off a wave of anger towards league president Clarence Campbell , who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats , mainly from French @-@ Canadians accusing him of anti @-@ French bias . Campbell dismissed the warnings , and attended the March 17 game as planned . His presence at the game was perceived by many fans as a provocation and he was booed and pelted with eggs and fruit . An hour into the game , a fan lobbed a tear @-@ gas bomb in Campbell 's direction , and firefighters decided to clear the building . Fans leaving the game and a growing mob of angry demonstrators rioted outside of the Montreal Forum , which became known as l 'affaire Richard , or the Richard Riot . Richard became the first player to score 500 career goals on October 19 , 1957 . He retired in 1960 as an eight @-@ time Stanley Cup champion , as well as the NHL 's all @-@ time leading scorer with 544 goals . 
 In the fall of 1951 , Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe watched special television feeds of games in an attempt to determine whether it would be a suitable medium for broadcasting hockey games . Television already had its detractors within the NHL , especially in Campbell . In 1952 , even though only 10 % of Canadians owned a television set , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) began televising games . On November 1 , 1952 , Hockey Night in Canada was first broadcast on television , with Foster Hewitt calling the action between the Leafs and Bruins at Maple Leaf Gardens . The broadcasts quickly became the highest @-@ rated show on Canadian television . Campbell feared televised hockey would cause people to stop attending games in person , but Smythe felt the opposite . CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States in the 1956 – 57 season as an experiment . Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts , it inaugurated a 21 @-@ game package of games the following year . The NHL itself adapted to be viewer @-@ friendly . In 1949 , the league mandated that the ice surface be painted white to make the puck easier to see . On January 18 , 1958 , Willie O 'Ree joined the Bruins as an injury call @-@ up for a game in Montreal . In doing so he became the first black player in the NHL . 
 Clint Benedict was the first goaltender to wear facial protection , donning it in 1930 to protect a broken nose . He quickly abandoned his mask as its design interfered with his vision . Twenty @-@ nine years later , on November 1 , 1959 , in a game against New York Rangers Jacques Plante made the goaltender mask a permanent fixture in hockey . The first players ' union was formed February 12 , 1957 by Red Wings player Ted Lindsay who had sat on the board of the NHL 's Pension Society since 1952 . Lindsay and his fellow players were upset by the league 's refusal to let them view the books related to the pension fund . The league claimed that it could not contribute more than it did but the players on the Pension Committee suspected otherwise . The idea quickly gained popularity and when the union 's founding was announced publicly , nearly every NHL player had signed up . Led by Alan Eagleson , the National Hockey League Players ' Association ( NHLPA ) was formed in 1967 and it quickly received acceptance from the owners . 
 = = = Dynasties = = = 
 The Original Six era was a period of dynasties . The Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup five times between 1944 – 45 and 1950 – 51 . In the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals , the Maple Leafs defeated the Canadiens four games to one in the only final in NHL history when all games were decided in overtime . Beginning in 1948 – 49 , the Red Wings won seven consecutive regular season titles , a feat that no other team has accomplished . During that time , the Wings won four Stanley Cups . It was during the 1952 Stanley Cup Finals that the Legend of the Octopus was created . Brothers Pete and Jerry <unk> brought a dead octopus to the Detroit Olympia for the fourth game of the finals . They hoped that the octopus would inspire Detroit to an eighth game victory . Detroit went on to defeat Montreal 3 – 0 and the tradition was born . The Red Wings faced the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals in three consecutive seasons between 1954 and 1956 . Detroit won the first two match @-@ ups , but Montreal captured the 1956 Stanley Cup , ending one dynasty and starting another . The Canadiens won five consecutive championships between 1956 and 1960 , a feat no other team has duplicated . The Original Six era ended with the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals between the two @-@ time defending champion Canadiens , and the Maple Leafs . The Maple Leafs finished the era by winning the Cup four times between 1962 and 1967 , their 1967 championship is the last Maple Leafs title to date . The Chicago Blackhawks , who won in 1961 , are the only other team to win the Stanley Cup during this period .

 = = = Expansion years = = = 
 In 1963 , Rangers governor William Jennings introduced to his peers the idea of expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964 – 65 season . While the governors did not agree to the proposal , the topic of expansion came up every time the owners met from then on out . In 1965 , it was decided to expand by six teams , doubling the size of the NHL . In February 1966 , the governors met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles , Minnesota , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Oakland and St. Louis . The league rejected bids from Baltimore , Buffalo and Vancouver . In Canada , there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967 ; three years later , the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver , which formerly played in the Western Hockey League , for the 1970 – 71 season , along with the Buffalo Sabres . 
 On January 13 , 1968 , North Stars ' rookie Bill Masterton became the first , and to date , only player to die as a result of injuries suffered during an NHL game . Early in a game against Oakland , Masterton was checked hard by two players causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head . Masterton was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries , and died there two days later . The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy later in the season . Following Masterton 's death , players slowly began wearing helmets , and starting in the 1979 – 80 season , the league mandated all players entering the league wear them . 
 In the 1968 – 69 season , third @-@ year defenceman Bobby Orr scored 21 goals to set an NHL record for goals by a defenceman en route to winning his first of eight consecutive Norris Trophies as the league 's top defenceman . At the same time , Orr 's teammate , Phil Esposito , became the first player in league history to score 100 points in a season , finishing with 126 points . A gifted scorer , Orr revolutionized defencemen 's impact on the offensive part of the game , as blue @-@ liners began to be judged on how well they created goals in addition to how well they prevented them . Orr twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL 's leading scorer , the only defenceman in NHL history to do so . Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career ; he played 12 seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in 1978 . Orr finished with 270 goals and 915 points in 657 games , and he won the Hart Memorial Trophy as league Most Valuable Player thrice . 
 The 1970 – 71 NHL season was the 54th season of the National Hockey League . Two new teams , the Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks made their debuts and were both put into the East Division . The Chicago Black Hawks were moved to the West Division . The Montreal Canadiens won the Stanley Cup by beating the Black Hawks in seven games in the finals . 
 The 1970s were associated with aggressive , and often violent play . Known as the " Broad Street Bullies " , the Philadelphia Flyers are the most famous example of this mindset . The Flyers established league records for penalty minutes — Dave " the Hammer " Schultz ' total of 472 in 1974 – 75 remains a league record . They captured the 1974 Stanley Cup , becoming the first expansion team to win the league championship . 
 = = = World Hockey Association = = = 
 In 1972 , the NHL faced competition from the newly formed World Hockey Association ( WHA ) . The WHA lured many players away from the NHL . The WHA 's biggest coup was to lure Bobby Hull from the Black Hawks to play for the Winnipeg Jets . He signed a $ 2 @.@ 75 million contract , and lent instant credibility to the new league . After Hull signed , several other players quickly followed suit and the NHL suddenly found itself in a war for talent . By the time the 1972 – 73 WHA season began , 67 players had switched from the NHL to the WHA . The NHL also found itself competing with the WHA for markets . Initially , the league had no intention to expand past 14 teams , but the threat the WHA represented caused the league to change its plans . The league hastily announced the creation of the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames as 1972 expansion teams . Following the 1972 – 73 season , the NHL announced it was further expanding to 18 @-@ teams for the 1974 – 75 season , adding the Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals . In just eight years , the NHL had tripled in size to 18 teams . By 1976 , both leagues were dealing with serious financial problems . Talk of a merger between the NHL and the WHA was growing . In 1976 , for the first time in four decades , the NHL approved franchise relocations ; the Scouts moved after just two years in Kansas City to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies , while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons . Two years later , after failed overtures about merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver , the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars , reducing the NHL to 17 teams for 1978 – 79 . 
 The move towards a merger picked up in 1977 when John Ziegler succeeded Clarence Campbell as NHL president . The WHA folded following the 1978 – 79 season , while the Edmonton Oilers , Hartford Whalers , Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets joined the NHL as expansion teams , which brought the league up to 21 teams , a constant until 1991 . The merger brought Gordie Howe back to the NHL for one final season in 1979 – 80 , during which he brought his NHL career total to 801 goals and 1 @,@ 850 points . It was also the last season for the Atlanta Flames . The team averaged only 9 @,@ 800 fans in attendance and lost over $ 2 million . They were sold for a record $ 16 million , and relocated north to become the Calgary Flames in 1980 – 81 . Two years later , the Rockies were sold for $ 30 million , and left Denver to become the New Jersey Devils for the 1982 – 83 season . 
 = = = More dynasties = = = 
 Although the league expanded from six to 21 teams , dynasties still prevailed in the NHL . The Montreal Canadiens won four consecutive Stanley Cups starting in 1975 @-@ 76 . In 1980 , the New York Islanders won their first of four consecutive Stanley Cups . The Islanders dominated both the regular season and the playoffs with the likes of Billy Smith , Mike Bossy , Denis Potvin , and Bryan Trottier . In 1981 , Bossy became the first player to score 50 goals in 50 games since Maurice Richard accomplished that feat in 1945 . 
 In 1982 – 83 , the Edmonton Oilers won the regular season championship . The Oilers were led by Wayne Gretzky , who remained with the Oilers when they joined the NHL in 1979 . He scored 137 points in 1979 – 80 and won the first of nine Hart Trophies as the NHL 's most valuable player . Over the next several seasons , Gretzky established new highs in goals scored in a season , with 92 in the 1981 – 82 season ; in assists , with 163 in the 1985 – 86 ; and in total points , with 215 in 1985 – 86 . Gretzky also set the record for scoring 50 goals in the fewest number of games , achieving the mark in 39 games . The Islanders and Oilers met in the Finals as New York swept Edmonton for their last Stanley Cup . The following season , the Oilers and Islanders met again in the playoffs . The Oilers won the rematch in five games , marking the start of another dynasty . 
 Led by Gretzky and Mark Messier , the Oilers won five Stanley Cup championships between 1984 and 1990 . On August 9 , 1988 , Oilers owner Peter Pocklington , in financial trouble , traded Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings . Gretzky 's trade to the Kings popularized ice hockey in the United States . With the Kings , Gretzky broke Gordie Howe 's record for the most career points . Mario Lemieux led Pittsburgh to Stanley Cups in 1990 – 91 and 1991 – 92 . A gifted forward , he won six Art Ross Trophies as the league 's leading scorer and he scored 199 points in 1988 – 89 , becoming the second highest single @-@ season point scorer behind Gretzky . Lemieux 's career was plagued by health issues , including non @-@ Hodgkin lymphoma , and he retired in 1997 . In 2000 he returned and finished his NHL career in 2006 with more than 1 @,@ 700 points . 
 = = = Fall of the Iron Curtain = = = 
 The NHL became first involved in international play in the mid @-@ 1970s , starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union . With the eight @-@ game series tied at three wins apiece and a tie , Paul Henderson scooped up a rebound and put it past Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak with 34 seconds left in the eighth and final game to score the series @-@ winning goal . 
 While European @-@ born players were a part of the NHL since its founding , it was still rare to see them in the NHL until 1980 , although the WHA employed a number of them . Borje Salming was the first European star in the NHL and Finns Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the 1980s . The WHA opened the door , and players slowly joined the NHL , but those behind the Iron Curtain were restricted from following suit . In 1980 , Peter Stastny , his wife , and his brother Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia with the aid of Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut . The <unk> ' defection made international headlines , and contributed to the first wave of Europeans ' entrance into the NHL . Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in the NHL , teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s , 27 in all by the 1988 draft ; however , defection was the only way such players could play in the NHL . Shortly before the end of the 1988 – 89 regular season , Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America . It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to leave the Soviet Union . Shortly after , Soviet players began to flood into the NHL . Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the 1990s , as 18 Soviets were selected in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft .

 The 21 @-@ team era ended in 1990 , when the league revealed ambitious plans to double league revenues from $ 400 million within a decade and bring the NHL to 28 franchises during that period . The NHL quickly announced three new teams : The San Jose Sharks , who began play in the 1991 – 92 season , and the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning , who followed a year later . The Lightning made NHL history when goaltender Manon Rheaume played a period of an exhibition game , September 23 , 1992 . In doing so , Rheaume became the first woman to play in an NHL game . One year later , the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Florida Panthers began play as the NHL 's 25th and 26th franchises respectively . The two new franchises were granted as part of the NHL 's attempts at regaining a network television presence by expanding throughout the American south . The NHL 's southward push continued in 1993 as the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas , Texas to become the Dallas Stars . 
 In 1994 , the players were locked out by the owners because of a lack of a Collective Bargaining Agreement ( CBA ) . The 1994 – 95 NHL lockout lasted 104 days and resulted in the season 's being shortened from a planned 84 games to 48 . The owners insisted on a salary cap , changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries , the union instead proposed a luxury tax system . Just as the entire season seemed to be lost , an 11th @-@ hour deal was agreed on . The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap but the deal was initially hailed as a win for the owners . The deal was not enough to save two teams in Canada 's smallest NHL markets . The revenue disparity between large and small market teams , exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian Dollar , forced the Quebec Nordiques to move to Denver and become the Colorado Avalanche in 1995 ; the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix , Arizona , becoming the Coyotes , the next year . The Hartford Whalers followed , moving to Greensboro , NC and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997 . The NHL continued its expansion into cities in the Southern United States . In 1998 , the Nashville Predators joined the league , followed by the Atlanta Thrashers the following year . To further market their players , the NHL decided to have its players play in the Winter Olympics , starting in 1998 , at the Nagano Games . In 2000 , the league added two franchises , boosting the total number to 30 . The NHL returned to Minnesota with the Wild and added the Blue Jackets in Columbus , Ohio . 
 = = = 2004 – 05 lockout = = = 
 By 2004 , the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues , and that the league as a whole lost over US $ 300 million in 2002 – 03 . As a result , on September 15 , 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out before the start of the 2004 – 05 season . On February 16 , 2005 , Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season . As with the 1994 – 95 lockout , the owners were again demanding a salary cap , which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost . The season 's cancellation led to a revolt within the union . NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow . By early July , the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement . The deal featured a hard salary cap , linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24 % rollback on salaries . 
 = = = 21st century = = = 
 Hoping to reduce the number of tie games during the regular season , the NHL decided that beginning in the 1999 – 2000 season , in any game tied after regulation time , both teams would be guaranteed one point , while the team that won in overtime would earn a second point . The Edmonton Oilers hosted the NHL 's first regular season outdoor hockey game , the Heritage Classic on November 22 , 2003 . The game against the Canadiens was held at Commonwealth Stadium before a then @-@ record crowd of 57 @,@ 167 fans who endured temperatures as low as − 18 degrees Celsius ( 0 degrees Fahrenheit ) . In the 2005 – 06 season , the NHL eliminated tie games , as the shootout was introduced to decide all regular season games tied after the five @-@ minute overtime period . The shootout was one of several rule changes made in 2005 , as the league attempted to open the game up after the lockout . One of the most controversial changes was the league 's zero @-@ tolerance policy on obstruction penalties . The league hoped that the game could be opened up if it cracked down on " clutching and grabbing " . The tighter regulations have met with numerous complaints about the legitimacy of some calls , that players are diving to draw penalties , and that officials are not calling enough penalties . The changes initially led to a sharp increase in scoring . Teams combined to score 6 @.@ 1 goals per game in 2005 – 06 , more than a full goal per game higher than in the 2003 – 04 season . This represented the highest increase in offence since 1929 – 30 . However , scoring has rapidly declined since , approaching pre @-@ lockout totals in 2007 – 08 . 
 In the 2005 – 06 season , rookies Alexander Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby began their careers . In their first three seasons , they each won both the Art Ross and Hart trophies ; Crosby in 2007 , and Ovechkin in 2008 . The success of the Heritage Classic led to the scheduling of more outdoor games . The Sabres hosted the 2008 NHL Winter Classic on New Year 's Day 2008 , losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a shootout before a crowd of 71 @,@ 217 at Ralph Wilson Stadium . The second Winter Classic was held January 1 , 2009 at Wrigley Field in Chicago between the Blackhawks and Red Wings . The third NHL Winter Classic was held in Fenway Park on January 1 , 2010 , between the Boston Bruins and the Philadelphia Flyers . The home team Bruins won . 
 Two clubs still experienced financial problems , however . The Phoenix Coyotes eventually filed for bankruptcy in May 2009 . The league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club 's operations , with the hopes of eventually reselling it to a new owner who would be committed to stay in the Phoenix market . The league did not find a satisfactory buyer for the Coyotes until 2013 . The financially struggling Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011 , who then relocated the team to Winnipeg , a stark reversal of the league 's Southward expansion more than a decade earlier . 
 The NHL again entered lockout in 2012 , cancelling the first 526 games , about 43 % of the season , until at least December 30 , 2012 . Just after 5 am on January 6 , 2013 , after approximately 16 continuous hours of negotiating , the NHL and the player 's union reached a tentative deal on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout . The first games of the season were held on January 19 .

 Ali started working in the New York offices of Versace when she was 17 . A colleague from Versace introduced her to producer Markus Moser , who was looking for a female @-@ singer ( or " chanteuse " ) to collaborate on some of his original productions for a girl group in Germany . The two teamed up with Moser working on production , while Ali wrote the lyrics and vocals for the songs . Her first song was the single " Rapture " , which she wrote in 30 minutes based on an encounter with an Australian nightclub patron . A demo of the song was first played at the New York club <unk> in 2001 and received early support from influential DJ Pete Tong who played the demo on his show on BBC Radio 1 . The song eventually became an Ibiza favourite after support from prominent <unk> such as Sasha , Danny <unk> and Sander Kleinenberg during the summer season . Released in late 2001 by Ministry of Sound , the single became a commercial success peaking at No. 2 on UK Singles Chart and Billboard 's Hot Dance Club Play Chart , while charting in several countries in Europe . The success of " Rapture " , Ali said , caused the formation of iiO as the music they were initially working on was quite different from dance music and were asked to come up with a project name to promote the single . They originally named themselves <unk> after the Sony <unk> laptop Ali used to write the lyrics on . The duo toured internationally and released several more singles , including " At the End " , " Runaway " , " Smooth " , and " Kiss You " . Their first studio album , Poetica followed in 2005 . 
 Ali left the group in 2005 to pursue a solo career , while Moser continued to release iiO material featuring her on vocals . Most notably , these releases include the 2006 single " Is It Love ? " , which reached No. 1 in America on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Chart , the 2007 remix album Reconstruction Time : The Best Of iiO Remixed and the 2011 studio album Exit 110 .

Co @-@ produced by Sultan & Ned Shepard , Alex <unk> and Scott Fritz , Ali self @-@ released the album on her own label , Smile in Bed Records . Embers generally received positive reviews , Chase Gran from About.com called it a " well rounded , gourmet album with impressive songs " . Gail Navarro from Racket magazine complimented Ali on her songwriting saying , " It wasn ’ t just her sultry sound mixed in together with that enchanting singing voice ; her songwriting got me hook , line and sinker " . Speaking about the self @-@ release of the album , she has cited her creative independence and the pressure of deadlines as the main reasons why she created her own record label . 
 Ali released two collaborations in 2009 , the first " Better Run " with <unk> was released on his album <unk> 128 @.@ 0 FM and " 12 Wives In Tehran " with Serge Devant was released on his album Wanderer .

 = SMS Lübeck = 
 SMS Lübeck ( " His Majesty 's Ship Lübeck " ) was the fourth of seven Bremen @-@ class cruisers of the Imperial German Navy , named after the city of Lübeck . She was begun by AG Vulcan Stettin in Stettin in 1903 , launched in March 1904 and commissioned in April 1905 . Armed with a main battery of ten 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and two 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , Lübeck was capable of a top speed of 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) . 
 Lübeck served with the High Seas Fleet for the first decade of her career , and after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she was transferred to the Baltic Sea to defend Germany 's coast from potential Russian attacks . She saw extensive service in the first three years of the war , during which time she participated in the seizure of Libau and was attacked by Allied submarines on two occasions . She struck a mine in 1916 but was repaired ; in 1917 , she was withdrawn for secondary duties . She survived the war , and was ceded to the British as a war prize in 1920 , and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Lübeck was ordered under the contract name Ersatz <unk> and was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1903 and launched on 26 March 1904 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 26 April 1905 . The ship was 111 @.@ 1 meters ( 365 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 13 @.@ 3 m ( 44 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 4 m ( 18 ft ) forward . She displaced 3 @,@ 661 t ( 3 @,@ 603 long tons ; 4 @,@ 036 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two Parsons steam turbines , designed to give 11 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 8 @,@ 600 kW ) for a top speed of 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) . She was the first warship in the German Navy to be equipped with turbine propulsion . The engines were powered by ten coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers . Lübeck carried up to 860 tonnes ( 850 long tons ) of coal , which gave her a range of 3 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 000 km ; 4 @,@ 400 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) , a shorter range than her sisters , due to her less efficient turbines . She had a crew of 14 officers and 274 – 287 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 40 guns in single mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , six were located amidships , three on either side , and two were placed side by side aft . The guns could engage targets out to 12 @,@ 200 m ( 40 @,@ 000 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 500 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . She was also equipped with two 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with four torpedoes , mounted on the deck . She was also fitted to carry fifty naval mines . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides , and the guns were protected by 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick shields . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After her commissioning , Lübeck was assigned to the High Seas Fleet . She served with the fleet until 1914 and the outbreak of World War I. She was then relegated to service as a coastal defense vessel in the Baltic . As the Central Powers prepared to launch the Gorlice – Tarnów Offensive in early May 1915 , the extreme left flank of the German Army was ordered to launch a diversionary attack on 27 April . Lübeck was assigned to the naval support for the attack ; on the first day of the attack , she and the cruiser Thetis shelled the port of Libau . Ten days later , the Army was poised to seize Libau , and so requested naval support for the attack . Lübeck and several other cruisers and torpedo boats covered the assault on the city and patrolled to ensure no Russian naval forces attempted to intervene . 
 Rear Admiral Hopman , the commander of the reconnaissance forces in the Baltic , conducted a major assault on Libau , in conjunction with an attempt by the German Army to seize the city . The attack took place on 7 May . Lübeck joined the armored cruisers Prinz Heinrich , Roon , and Prinz Adalbert , the elderly coast defense ship Beowulf , and the light cruisers Augsburg and Thetis . They were escorted by a number of destroyers , torpedo boats , and minesweepers . The IV Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet was detached from the North Sea to provide cover for the operation . The bombardment went as planned , though the destroyer V107 struck a mine in Libau 's harbor , which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship . German ground forces were successful in their assault however , and took the city . A week later , on 14 May , Lübeck was to lay a minefield off the Gulf of Finland with Augsburg , but Russian submarines in the area convinced the Germans to cancel the operation . 
 On 1 July , the minelayer SMS Albatross , escorted by the cruisers Lübeck , Roon , and Augsburg and seven destroyers , laid a minefield north of Bogskär . While returning to port , the flotilla separated into two sections ; Augsburg , Albatross , and three destroyers made for Rixhöft while the remainder of the unit went to Libau . Augsburg and Albatross were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev , consisting of three armored and two light cruisers . Commodore Johannes von Karpf , the flotilla commander , ordered the slower Albatross to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled Roon and Lübeck . Albatross was grounded off Gotland and Augsburg escaped , and the Russian squadron briefly engaged Roon before both sides broke contact . Upon being informed of the situation , Hopman sortied with Prinz Heinrich and Prinz Adalbert to support von Karpf . While en route , the cruisers encountered the British submarine E9 , which scored a hit on Prinz Adalbert . Hopman broke off the operation and returned to port with the damaged cruiser . 
 On 9 August , Lübeck was attacked by the Russian submarine Gepard outside the Irben Strait at the entrance to the Gulf of Riga . Gepard fired a spread of five torpedoes at a range of 1 @,@ 200 m ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) , but Lübeck successfully evaded them . On 6 November , Lübeck again came under attack from an Allied submarine ; on this occasion , it was the British HMS E8 . Again , Lübeck managed to evade the torpedoes and escape undamaged . The Allies finally had success against the ship on 13 January 1916 , when a Russian mine damaged Lübeck ; she nevertheless returned to port and was repaired . At the same time , she and her sister Bremen were rearmed with two 15 cm SK L / 45 and six 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns . A new bow was fitted and her funnels were replaced with new models . 
 In 1917 , she was withdrawn from front @-@ line service and employed as a training ship , as well as a target ship . Lübeck served in this capacity until the end of the war in November 1918 . Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , the ship was surrendered to the British as a war prize . She was formally ceded on 3 September 1920 under the name P ; the British in turn sold her for scrapping in 1922 , and she was dismantled in Germany over the following year . 
 = Naem = 
 Naem ( Thai : <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> ̌ <unk> ] , also referred to as <unk> , naem moo , naem maw , and chin som ) is a pork sausage in Thai cuisine . It is a fermented food that has a sour flavor . It typically has a short shelf life , and is often eaten in raw form after the fermentation process has occurred . It is a popular food in Thai cuisine , and different regions of Thailand have various preferred flavors , including variations of sour and spicy . Naem is used as an ingredient in various dishes and is also served as a side dish . 
 Naem contains 185 kilocalories per a serving size of 100 grams ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) and contains a significant amount of protein , has a moderate amount of fat and minor carbohydrate content . Parasites and enteropathogenic bacteria have been found in samples of naem , and lactic acid formed during its fermentation inhibits the growth of Salmonella . Lactobacillus <unk> use in the product has been proven to prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria in naem . It is sometimes treated with irradiation . The bacterial content in Thai sour pork products is regulated . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Naem is a red @-@ colored , semi @-@ dry lactic @-@ fermented pork sausage in Thai cuisine prepared using minced raw pork and pork skin , significant amounts of cooked sticky rice , chili peppers , garlic , sugar , salt and potassium nitrate . Minced beef is sometimes used in its preparation . After the mix is prepared , it is encased in banana leaves , synthetic sausage casings or tubular plastic bags and left to ferment for three to five days . Naem has a sour quality to it due to the fermentation , in which lactic acid bacteria and yeasts grow within the sausage . The lactic acid bacteria and yeasts expand by feeding upon the rice and sugar , and the use of salt prevents the meat from rotting . 
 Naem typically has a short shelf life , which can be extended through refrigeration . The sausage can be time @-@ consuming and labor @-@ intensive to prepare . In Thailand , it is typically stored at room temperature , which gives it a shelf life of around one week . It is also produced in areas of Southeast Asia that are near Thailand . 
 Naem is often consumed raw , ( after fermentation has occurred ) , and is often accompanied with shallot , ginger , bird ’ s eye chili peppers and spring onions . It is used as an ingredient in various dishes such as naem fried with eggs , Naem <unk> and Naem phat <unk> sen sai khai , and is also consumed as a side dish and as a condiment . The cooking of naem significantly changes its flavor .

 Dishes prepared with naem include naem fried with eggs , and naem fried rice . Naem phat <unk> sen sai khai is a dish prepared with naem , glass noodles and eggs , among other ingredients such as spring onions and red pepper . Naem <unk> is a salad dish in Lao cuisine prepared using Lao fermented pork sausage , rice , coconut , peanuts , mint , cilantro , fish sauce and lemon juice . The naem and rice are formed into balls , deep @-@ fried , and then served broken atop the various ingredients . A restaurant named " Serenade " in Bangkok , Thailand purveys a dish called the " <unk> " , which consists of a duck egg wrapped in naem that is fried and then plated atop a dish with risotto , <unk> , shiitake mushrooms , herbs and cooked sea scallops atop crushed garlic . 
 There are many applications of sour pork with different flavors such as phat <unk> naem ( Thai : <unk> ็ <unk> ) , tom kha naem ( Thai : <unk> ้ <unk> ่ <unk> ) , ho mok naem ( Thai : <unk> ่ <unk> ) , and naem <unk> wan ( Thai : <unk> ้ <unk> ) .

 = Typhoon Helen ( 1972 ) = 
 Typhoon Helen was the most destructive tropical cyclone to strike Japan during the 1972 Pacific typhoon season . Originating from a tropical disturbance on September 11 near the Northern Mariana Islands , Helen gradually intensified as it moved northwestward . By September 14 , it reached typhoon strength and soon turned northeast towards Japan . Accelerating due to a trough over the East China Sea , Helen rapidly approached the country and made landfall near Cape Kushimoto as a Category 3 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . Later that day , a weakened Helen emerged into the Sea of Japan . After merging with an upper @-@ level low , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 19 and was last noted two days later after moving through southern Hokkaido . 
 In Japan , Typhoon Helen produced torrential rain , peaking at 790 mm ( 31 in ) in Hokkaido , and damaging winds that caused widespread damage . A total of 4 @,@ 213 homes were destroyed and another 146 @,@ 547 were damaged as a result of flash flooding and landslides . Numerous vessels ran aground due to rough seas associated with the storm , including several thousand ton cargo freighters . In all , 87 fatalities and $ 102 million in damage was attributed to Typhoon Helen . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In early September 1972 , a tropical disturbance developed within a near @-@ equatorial trough near the Northern Mariana Islands . On September 11 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) began monitoring this system as a tropical depression shortly after moving through the island chain . Initially , the system tracked southwestward before turning northwestward along the edge of a ridge . On September 13 , a United States Air Force reconnaissance plane flew into the system and found that it had intensified into a tropical storm . At this time , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring the newly named Tropical Storm Helen . Additionally , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began warning on the system , assigning it the local name <unk> . The following day , Helen attained typhoon status as it turned northward . Subsequently , a deepening trough over the East China Sea caused the typhoon to turn north @-@ northeastward and accelerate . 
 During the afternoon of September 16 , a reconnaissance plane recorded flight @-@ level winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Around this time , surface winds were estimated to be the same , making Helen a Category 3 equivalent on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . Later that day , the storm made landfall near Cape Kushimoto . In Shionomisaki Lighthouse , just west of where the center of Helen passed , a barometric pressure of 955 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 26 inHg ) was recorded , the lowest in relation to the storm . As the system neared Hokkaido , it slowed down and began a multi @-@ day anticyclonic loop . During this period , it merged with an upper @-@ level low and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 19 . The remnants of Helen then tracked across southern Hokkaido before dissipating just east of the island on September 21 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Prior to the typhoon 's arrival , officials in Japan warned residents of heavy rains . The Japanese National Railways network suspended service to areas threatened by the storm , stranding numerous people . By September 18 , approximately one sixth of the railway service was canceled or delayed . 
 Throughout the main island of Honshu , areas within 110 km ( 70 mi ) of the storm 's center experienced winds in excess of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , leading to considerable disruptions to air , sea , and land travel . The highest gust was measured at 181 km / h ( 112 mph ) in <unk> . These winds caused a city @-@ wide power outage in Tsu , Mie and scattered outages in Nagoya . Over a substantial portion of the country , the storm produced torrential rains that triggered deadly flash floods . Peak rainfall in Honshu and Hokkaido reached 580 mm ( 23 in ) and 790 mm ( 31 in ) , respectively . In Shikoku , ten people died after a landslide destroyed nine homes in Kōchi City . Across Japan , a total of 4 @,@ 213 homes were destroyed and another 146 @,@ 547 were damaged , leaving at least 3 @,@ 000 people homeless . Roads and bridges sustained extensive damage , with large stretches being washed out . According to police in Tokyo , 140 bridges sustained damage . In <unk> , a tornado spawned by Helen destroyed eight homes . 
 Large swells from the storm caused large vessels to wash ashore , including a 9 @,@ 000 ton freighter in Ise Bay . Twenty @-@ four fishermen drowned off the coast of Hachijō @-@ jima after two vessels sank . Throughout Japan , 322 ships were either damaged or ran aground due to the storm . Including offshore , Helen killed 85 people in Japan . Along the east coast of South Korea , these swells resulted in two fatalities . 
 On September 17 , the Japanese military was mobilized to assist in relief efforts . In all , 87 fatalities , 158 injuries and $ 102 million in damage was attributed to Typhoon Helen , making it the most destructive tropical cyclone to strike Japan in 1972 .

Shortly after in 1991 , he composed his first solo work , the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Adventure ( Seiken Densetsu ) , another Game Boy title . He then returned to the SaGa series for the next few years , composing the soundtracks to the Super Famicom 's Romancing SaGa , Romancing SaGa 2 , and Romancing SaGa 3 . These soundtracks sparked Ito 's first arranged albums ; the first game was arranged in a French musical style by Masaaki Mizuguchi , while the other two were arranged by Ryou Fukui and Taro <unk> , respectively , into orchestral pieces . Ito was originally scheduled to continue on with the Mana series and compose the soundtrack to Seiken Densetsu 2 ( Secret of Mana ) , but was forced to hand the project off to Hiroki Kikuta as his first score due to the demand on his time for scoring Romancing SaGa . 
 1995 marked the first time since he started composing that he worked on a title outside of the Mana or SaGa series ; he composed the music for Koi wa Balance and was a member of an eight @-@ person team for Tobal No. 1 . He returned to the SaGa series in 1997 with SaGa Frontier , and finished out the decade with Chocobo Racing and Chocobo 's Dungeon 2 ; for Chocobo Racing he only arranged previous works from the Chocobo and Final Fantasy series , and contributed only a few tracks to Chocobo 's Dungeon 2 . He left Square in 2001 to become a freelance composer . He has said that this move was in order to give him the flexibility to work on more than just video game music . 
 The first work that Ito composed after leaving Square was the soundtrack to <unk> II , which he regards as his best work . He attributes this feeling both to the fact that it was his first freelance piece and that he handled all aspects of the music production , from composition through arrangement and sound production . From there he returned to working with Square and the Mana series with the remake of his second soundtrack , Final Fantasy Adventure , into the soundtrack of Sword of Mana . It was an act he would repeat two years later for Square , now Square Enix , with the remake of Romancing SaGa , Romancing SaGa : Minstrel Song . He has since returned to the Mana series twice , with the soundtracks to Children of Mana and Dawn of Mana . All of the video game soundtracks that he has composed since the third expansion pack for Cross Gate in 2004 have been with the assistance of other composers except for 2007 's Hero Must Die , though during those years he has branched out from video games into composing and producing albums and singles for performers as well as composing music for plays and concerts . He has also released an album of piano pieces that he has composed ; only two of the eight tracks are from his video game works . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Ito performed piano live during the September 22 , 2006 Press Start 2006 -Symphony of Games- live concert , at which several of his pieces were performed by an orchestra . This concert followed an August 26 , 2006 concert Manami Kiyota x Kenji Ito Collaboration Live in which he played the piano for songs composed by him for the event and sung by Manami Kiyota ; he has also played the piano at concerts given by The Black Mages , a band composed of current or former Square musicians , before they expanded to include a full @-@ time pianist . Music composed by Ito has also been performed at the Extra <unk> Game Music Event 2007 and Christmas Live 2008 " <unk> <unk> " concerts . 
 Music composed by Ito was performed at a concert devoted to his music on February 21 , 2009 titled " gentle echo meeting " at the <unk> Hall in Chiyoda , Tokyo . A group of five musicians performed eight of his songs , interspersed with performances by Ito and discussions about his music between himself and Masahiro Sakurai . The event began as a concert due to Ito 's wish to host one based on his music , but after the space the organizing company , Harmonics International , rented turned out to be run by a high school classmate of Ito , at the classmate 's insistence the discussions of Ito 's music were added to the program . 
 Music from the original soundtracks of Dawn of Mana and Sword of Mana has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing . Two compilation books of music from the series as a whole have also been published as Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music first and second editions , with the first edition including tracks by Ito from Final Fantasy Adventure while the second added tracks he composed from Dawn of Mana . All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos , though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible . Additionally , KMP Music Publishing has published a book of the piano music included in the Sword of Mana soundtrack album , which Ito arranged from his original compositions . DOREMI Music Publishing also published music from the original soundtracks of some of the SaGa games that Ito composed as piano sheet music book ; music from Romancing SaGa 3 , Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song , and SaGa Frontier were written by Asako Niwa for piano solos of beginning to intermediate difficulty . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Ito 's music is mainly inspired by images from the game rather than outside influences ; however , he never played the games themselves . The only video games that he plays are sports games ; he has only seen up to the introductory movie for most of the role @-@ playing games that he has written music for . While many of his pieces are orchestral , he enjoys working in a recording studio and enjoys composing " normal songs " as much as his orchestral works . His favorite video game music from other composers include the music from Star Fox , Dragon Quest , Final Fantasy , Wizardry and Nobunaga 's Ambition . Non @-@ video game music that has inspired him includes Japanese popular music and soundtracks to anime works , as well as easy listening music such as Paul Mauriat or Richard <unk> , especially string music . These influences have led him to wish to create music " that you can listen to while you relax " . He also wishes to expand his compositions outside of video game music and into ballads .

A Timbaland @-@ owned imprint label , Mosley Music Group , featured artists such as Nelly Furtado , whose Timbaland @-@ produced album Loose ( 2006 ) was a commercial and critical success . In 2007 , Timbaland released a solo album , Shock Value , which was followed by Shock Value II in 2009 .

 = = Early life = = 
 Timothy Zachery Mosley was born on March 10 , 1972 in Norfolk , Virginia , the son of <unk> , who ran a homeless shelter , and Garland Mosley , an Amtrak employee . He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach , Virginia . During his time as a DJ , he was known as " DJ Tim " or " DJ Timmy Tim " . His brother , Sebastian , is reportedly around nine years younger . His sister Courtney <unk> is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey . While attending high school , Timbaland began a long @-@ term collaboration with rapper Melvin <unk> , who performed under the name of Magoo . The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble <unk> ( which stood for ' Surrounded By Idiots ' ) which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell . Mosley was also high school friends with Terrence and Gene Thorton , who would go on to be known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse . In 1986 , when Timbaland was 14 years old , he was accidentally shot by a co @-@ worker at the local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months . During this time , he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand . 
 Singer and rapper Missy Elliott heard his material and began working with him . She and her R & B group Sista auditioned for DeVante Swing , a producer and member of the successful R & B act Jodeci . DeVante signed Sista to his Swing Mob record label and Elliott brought Mosley and <unk> along with her to New York , where Swing Mob was based . It was DeVante who renamed the young producer Timbaland , after the Timberland brand of construction boots . He and Magoo became part of SCI <unk> School stable of Swing Mob signees known as " Da Bassment " crew , joining artists such as R & B singer Ginuwine , male vocal group Playa ( Smoke E. <unk> , Static Major and Digital Black ) , and the girl group <unk> . Timbaland did production work on a number of projects with DeVante , including the 1995 Jodeci LP The Show , The After @-@ Party , The Hotel , and Sista ’ s ( unreleased ) début LP 4 All the <unk> Around da World . Elliott began receiving recognition as a songwriter for artists such as R & B girl group 702 and MC Lyte . Due to Timbaland 's connection with her , he was often contacted to produce remixes of her songs .

 Timbaland began his producing career for R & B acts . In the mid @-@ 1990s , he produced a few songs for R & B acts such as Jodeci and Sista . In 1996 , he made his mainstream breakthrough by producing the majority of both Aaliyah 's second album One in a Million and Ginuwine 's debut album Ginuwine ... the Bachelor . This included the major hit singles " If Your Girl Only Knew " by Aaliyah and " Pony " by Ginuwine . While Timbaland was initially producing for R & B artists , his trademark sound was very much rooted in hip @-@ hop with its fast @-@ paced nature and clear drum breaks . He was taking a hip @-@ hop sound and applying it to R & B , and in this way his sound was instrumental in blurring the distinction between hip @-@ hop and R & B production . In 1997 , he fully produced Supa <unk> Fly , the debut album of Missy Elliott , who had been a childhood friend of Mosley . In this album Timbaland continued with his now trademark electronic production style , but since Missy frequently rapped the music was considered hip @-@ hop . Also in 1997 , he released his first album with his partner Magoo , Welcome to Our World , also a hip @-@ hop album . In the late 1990s , his hip @-@ hop production sound would become very influential and common as he produced for many high profile hip @-@ hop artists including Jay @-@ Z , Nas , and The LOX . In 1999 , he scored a major hit with Jay Z and rap group UGK with the hit " Big Pimpin ' " . He also fully produced Missy 's second album in 1999 , Da Real World . Still Timbaland in this period produced primarily for R & B artists . He continued to produce for Ginuwine and Aaliyah , as well as contributing significantly to albums by Xscape , Nicole , Playa , and Total . He remixed Usher 's major hit " You Make Me Wanna " . In the early 2000s Timbaland produced songs including Ludacris ' " Roll Out ( My Business ) " , Jay @-@ Z 's " <unk> ' <unk> " , Petey Pablo 's " Raise Up " , and Beck 's cover of David Bowie 's " Diamond Dogs " during this period . He also contributed three songs , all eventually released as singles , to Aaliyah ’ s self @-@ titled third album , the exotic lead single " We Need a Resolution " ( featuring himself rapping a verse ) , " More than a Woman " , and the ballad " I Care 4 U " . He also makes an appearance in Aaliyah 's single " Try Again " , which he also produced and co @-@ wrote . 
 Timbaland & Magoo ’ s second album together was slated for release in November 2000 . Indecent Proposal was to feature appearances by Beck , Aaliyah , as well as new Timbaland protégés — some from his new Beat Club Records <unk> . Jade , Kiley Dean , Sebastian ( Timbaland 's brother ) , Petey Pablo , and Tweet ( who was a member of <unk> during the Swing Mob days ) . The album was delayed for an entire year , finally released in November 2001 . It was a commercial disappointment . Beck ’ s vocals for the track " I Am Music " were not included on the last version , which instead featured Timbaland singing along Steve " Static " Garrett of Playa and Aaliyah . The first release on Beat Club was the début album by Bubba Sparxxx in September 2001 , Dark Days , Bright Nights . The loss of Aaliyah deeply affected Timbaland . In a phone call to the MTV show Total Request Live , Timbaland said : 
 She was like blood , and I lost blood . Me and her together had this chemistry . I kinda lost half of my creativity to her . It 's hard for me to talk to the fans now . Beyond the music , she was a brilliant person , the [ most special ] person I ever met .

He also produced tracks for artists such as Lil ' Kim ( " The Jump Off " ) and southern rapper Pastor Troy during this period . Collaborating with fellow producer Scott Storch , Timbaland also worked on a number of tracks on former * NSYNC lead singer Justin Timberlake ’ s solo debut , Justified , including the song " Cry Me a River " . 
 Late in 2003 , Timbaland delivered the second Bubba Sparxxx album , Deliverance , and the third Timbaland & Magoo album , Under Construction , Part II Both albums were released to little fanfare or acclaim even though Deliverance was praised by reviews and embraced by the internet community . In 2004 Timbaland produced singles for LL Cool J , Xzibit , Fatman Scoop , and Jay Z , and he produced the bulk of Brandy ’ s fourth album , Afrodisiac . Timbaland co @-@ wrote two tracks ( Exodus ' 04 and Let Me Give You My Love ) and produced three tracks of the American @-@ Japanese Pop star Hikaru Utada ’ s debut English album , Exodus .

On April 3 , 2007 , Timbaland released a collaboration album featuring artists including 50 Cent , Dr. Dre , Elton John , Fall Out Boy , Nelly Furtado , Missy Elliott , and others called Timbaland Presents Shock Value . A rivalry flared up between Timbaland and record producer Scott Storch in early 2007 . The tension initially started on the single " Give It to Me " , when Timbaland anonymously <unk> Storch : " I 'm a real producer and you [ ' re ] just the piano man " . In an interview , Timbaland confirmed that he was talking about Storch . The dispute partly stemmed from controversy regarding writing credits for Timberlake 's " Cry Me a River " .

 = Cornwallis in India = 
 British General Charles Cornwallis , the 2nd Earl Cornwallis , was appointed in February 1786 to serve as both Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of British India and Governor of the Presidency of Fort William , also known as the Bengal Presidency . Based in Calcutta , he oversaw the consolidation of British control over much of peninsular India , setting the stage for the British Raj . He was also instrumental in enacting administrative and legal reforms that fundamentally altered civil administration and land management practices in India . According to historian Jerry Dupont , Cornwallis was responsible for " laying the foundation for British rule throughout India and setting standards for the services , courts , and revenue collection that remained remarkably unaltered almost to the end of the British era . " 
 He was raised to the title of Marquess Cornwallis in 1792 as recognition for his performance in the Third Anglo @-@ Mysore War , in which he extracted significant concessions from the Mysorean ruler , Tipu Sultan . He returned to England in 1793 , and was subsequently engaged in a variety of administrative and diplomatic postings until 1798 , when he was posted to the Kingdom of Ireland as Lord Lieutenant and Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , similar to his leadership posts in India . After returning from Ireland in 1801 , he was again posted to India . He arrived in July 1805 , and died the same October in Ghazipur . Cornwallis was buried at Ghazipur , and is memorialised throughout India . 
 = = Background = = 
 Lord Charles Cornwallis was a British army officer , civil administrator , and diplomat . His career was primarily military in nature , including a series of well @-@ known campaigns during the War of American Independence from 1776 to 1781 that culminated in his surrender at Yorktown . Following his return to England in 1782 he was prevented by his parole from further participation in the war , and financial demands eventually caused him to seek a position of greater pay than the half @-@ pay that military officers received when not in service . 
 = = = India in the 1780s = = = 
 The area encompassed by modern India was significantly fractured following the decline of the Mughal Empire in the first half of the 18th century . European colonial outposts , from countries including Denmark , Portugal , France , and the Dutch Republic , dotted both the Coromandel ( east ) and Malabar ( west ) coasts of the subcontinent , although many of these had been established with the formal permission of a local ruler ( which was sometimes secured by force of arms ) . The Kingdom of Travancore dominated the southern tip , the Kingdom of Mysore held sway over the centre of the peninsula , and the Maratha Empire , a confederation of loosely allied principalities , dominated the northern reaches from Calcutta to Bombay . Although there were significant British presences at Bombay and Madras , each governed by a separate presidency , the Bengal region , including Calcutta , had come under the direct rule of the British East India Company in 1757 , with authority to levy taxes , and its presidency dominated the others . Its civil head , the Governor @-@ General of Fort William , ranked ahead of those of Madras and Bombay . Cornwallis quickly established himself as a transformational leader . 
 British colonial administration was dominated in the 1760s and 1770s by Warren Hastings , the first man to hold the title of Governor @-@ General . The military arm of the East India Company was directed during the Seven Years ' War and the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War by General Eyre Coote , who died in 1783 during the later stages of the war with Mysore . Company policy , as implemented by Hastings , had involved the company in intrigues and shifting alliances involving France , Mysore , the Marathas , and factions within those and other local territories . 
 = = Appointment = = 
 Cornwallis was first considered for a posting to India during the ministry of the Earl of Shelburne in the spring of 1782 . Shelburne asked Cornwallis if he wanted to go to India as governor general , an idea Cornwallis viewed with favour , as it provided employment without risking his parole status . However , Shelburne was a weak leader , and was turned out of power in early 1783 , replaced by a coalition government dominated by men Cornwallis ( and King George ) disliked , Charles James Fox and Lord North . Cornwallis , who normally avoided politics ( in spite of holding a seat in the House of Lords ) , became more vocal in opposition to the Fox @-@ North ministry , hoping his support would be repaid by the next government . 
 With the ascendancy of William Pitt the Younger to power in December 1783 , doors to new positions were opened to the earl . Pitt first offered him the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland , which he politely refused . He also made it clear that , were he posted to India , he would want the supreme military command in addition to civil control . When informed that Pitt was agreeable to this demand , he went through a period of soul @-@ searching , torn between the conflicting demands of family and country . This , however , was not the only troubling issue . When Parliament took up consideration of assignments in India in August 1784 , it was only prepared to offer one of the two posts , which he again refused to consider . Passed over for other military postings , Pitt placated him with the post of Constable of the Tower . 
 After refusing another inadequate entreaty from Pitt to take a post in India in February 1785 , Cornwallis 's demand for both posts were finally met a year later , on 23 February 1786 . Departing London in May , he arrived at Madras on 22 August 1786 , after " a most prosperous and expeditious passage " , and at Calcutta on 12 September . Although he was accorded a welcome suitable to his rank , the acting governor @-@ general , John Macpherson , was unhappy at being replaced . He attempted to reserve for his own use the Government House , which was normally reserved for the governor @-@ general . Cornwallis , after having his oaths of office administered , immediately announced his intention to occupy the residence . 
 = = Administrative reforms = = 
 Cornwallis was charged by the directors of the British East India Company to overhaul and reform its administration in India . The company had historically paid its functionaries ( revenue collectors , traders , and administrators ) in India relatively little , but allowed them to engage in trade for themselves , including the use of company shipping for the purpose . As long as the company was profitable , this open door to corruption and graft at the company 's expense was overlooked . However , the rise of manufacturing in Britain led to a collapse of prices for textiles and other goods from India , and the company 's involvement in wars on the subcontinent had also been expensive . By the time Cornwallis arrived the company was losing money . Its employees , however , continued to profit personally , without caring whether or not the company made money . Cornwallis sought to change this practice , first by refusing to engage in such dealing himself , and second , by securing pay increases for the company 's functionaries while denying them their personal trading privileges . 
 Another area of reform that Cornwallis implemented was the reduction of nepotism and political favouritism as means for advancement and positions within the company . Seeking instead to advance the company 's interests , he sought out and promoted individuals on the basis of merit , even refusing requests by the Prince of Wales to assist individuals in the latter 's good graces . 
 = = Judicial reforms = = 
 Prior to the earl 's arrival , judicial and police powers in territories controlled by the company were a confusion of differing standards that were also either inconsistently or arbitrarily applied . Part of Cornwallis 's work was the introduction of criminal and judicial regulations that to a significant degree still underpin the Indian judicial system . 
 Indian cities , much like British cities of the time , were poorly policed , and crime was widespread . Different penal and civil codes were applied to Hindus and Muslims , and the codification of these codes in different languages meant that it was virtually impossible for justice to be properly and consistently applied . Much of the criminal justice system in Bengal remained in the hands of the nawab , the nominal local ruler of the company 's territory . Furthermore , individuals with powerful political connections in their community often were able to act with impunity , since no one suffering at their hands was likely to press charges for fear of retribution . Hastings had several times made changes to policing and the administration of justice , but none of these had had a significant impact on the problem . 
 Cornwallis received critical assistance from others in his effort to introduce legal reforms . William Jones , an expert on languages , translated existing Hindu and Muslim penal codes into English so that they could be evaluated and applied by English @-@ speaking judges . Cornwallis began in 1787 by giving limited criminal judicial powers to the company 's revenue collectors , who already also served as civil magistrates . He also required them to report regularly on detention times and sentences given . In 1790 the company took over the administration of justice from the nawab , and Cornwallis introduced a system of circuit courts with a superior court that met in Calcutta and had the power of review over circuit court decisions . Judges were drawn from the company 's European employees . These reforms also included changes to the penal codes to begin harmonising the different codes then in use . By the time of his departure in 1793 his work on the penal code , known in India as the Cornwallis Code , was substantially complete . 
 One consequence of the Cornwallis Code was that it , in effect , institutionalised racism in the legal system . Cornwallis , in a manner not uncommon at the time , believed that well @-@ bred gentlemen of European extraction were superior to others , including those that were the product of mixed relationships in India . Of the latter , he wrote " as on account of their colour & extraction they are considered in this country as inferior to Europeans , I am of opinion that those of them who possess the best abilities could not command that authority and respect which is necessary in the due discharge of the duty of an officer . " In 1791 he issued an order that " No person , the son of a Native Indian , shall henceforward be appointed by this Court to Employment in the Civil , Military , or Marine Service of the Company . " Cornwallis 's biographers , the Wickwires , also observe that this institutionalisation of the British as an elite class simply added another layer on top of the complex status hierarchy of caste and religion that existed in India at the time . Cornwallis could not have formalised these policies without the ( tacit or explicit ) agreement of the company 's directors and employees . 
 Cornwallis 's <unk> toward the lower classes did , however , include a benevolent and somewhat paternalistic desire to improve their condition . He introduced legislation to protect native weavers who were sometimes forced into working at starvation wages by unscrupulous company employees , outlawed child slavery , and established in 1791 a Sanskrit college for Hindus that is now the Government Sanskrit College in Benares . He also established a mint in Calcutta that , in addition to benefiting the poor by providing a reliable standard currency , was a forerunner India 's modern currency . 
 = = The Permanent Settlement = = 
 The Company 's acquisition of the territories of Bengal in the 1760s led to its decisions to collect taxes as high as 89 % of land produce in the area as a means of reducing investment capital directed toward India . A variety of taxation schemes were implemented in the following years , none of which produced satisfactory results , and many of which left too much power over the natives in the hands of the tax collectors , or zamindars . The company 's directors gave Cornwallis the task of coming up with a taxation scheme that would meet the company 's objectives without being an undue burden on the working men of its territories . 
 John Shore ( who went on to succeed Cornwallis as Governor @-@ General ) and Charles Grant , two men he came to trust implicitly , were the most important contributors to what is now called the Permanent Settlement . The essence of the arrangement they came up with in the summer of 1789 was that the zamindars would effectively become hereditary landholders , paying the company tax based on the value of the land . Shore and Cornwallis disagreed on the term of the scheme , with Shore arguing for a ten @-@ year time limit on the arrangement , while Cornwallis argued for a truly permanent scheme . Cornwallis prevailed , noting that many of the company 's English revenue collectors , as well as others knowledgeable of company finance and taxation , supported permanency . In 1790 the proposal was sent to London , where the company directors approved the plan in 1792 . Cornwallis began implementing the regulations in 1793 . 
 Critics of the Permanent Settlement objected to its permanency , claimed that the company was forgoing revenue , and that Cornwallis and others advocating it misunderstood the historic nature of the zamindars . The Wickwires note that Cornwallis relied extensively on advice not only from John Shore , who had extensive experience in India prior to Cornwallis 's arrival , but also from the revenue collectors in the various districts , who were almost uniformly in favour of a permanent settlement with the zamindars . He was also clear on the need to protect the ryots ( land tenants ) from the excesses of the zamindars , writing , " It is immaterial to government what individual possessed the land , provided he cultivates it , protects the ryots , and pays the public revenue . " 
 = = Penang and Nepal = = 
 Cornwallis 's predecessor , John Macpherson , had authorised negotiations with the sultan of Kedah for the establishment of a company trading post on the island of Penang . Captain Francis Light , a trader familiar with the East Indies , negotiated an agreement in which the sultan , who was surrounded by powerful adversaries , received a share of the trade profits and a defensive military alliance in exchange for Penang . Captain Light made representations to the sultan that the company had agreed to these terms , and occupied the island in August 1786 . Cornwallis , concerned that the military aspects of the agreement might draw the company into conflicts with the sultan 's adversaries or the Dutch , withheld approval of the agreement and requested the company 's directors to decide the issue . When the company refused the military alliance , the sultan began blockading the island , renamed Prince of Wales Island by Light , and started in 1790 to accumulate troops with the view toward forcibly evicting the British . Cornwallis 's brother William , then with the Royal Navy in the area , sailed from Penang to pick up troops in India for its defence . Captain Light , however , routed the sultan 's forces in April 1791 before those reinforcements arrived . An agreement was then signed in which the company paid the sultan an annual stipend for the use of Penang . The fort that Captain Light constructed to protect Penang 's principal town , George Town , became known as Fort Cornwallis in the earl 's honour . 
 In 1792 , King Rana Bahadur Shah of Nepal , with whom the company had established trade relations , requested military assistance . Shah had been expanding his territory militarily by taking over smaller adjacent principalities , but a 1791 invasion of Tibet was met with a stiff Chinese response . Cornwallis declined the king 's request , sending instead Colonel William Kirkpatrick to mediate the dispute . Kirkpatrick was the first Englishman to see Nepal ; by the time he reached Kathmandu in 1793 , the parties had already resolved their dispute . 
 = = War with Mysore = = 
 Immediately after the signing of the Treaty of Mangalore in 1784 , ending the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War , Tipu Sultan , the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore , restated his hatred for the British , declaring that he would seek to renew conflict with them . Cornwallis , upon his arrival in India , took steps to modify or abrogate agreements with the Maratha Empire and with the Nizam of Hyderabad ( both of whom had territories on Mysore 's northern border ) that he saw as problematic with respect to the provisions of the 1784 treaty . He did assure them that if France became involved in conflict against their territories that the company would assist them . Pursuant to this policy , he refused to send company troops to assist the Marathas and the Nizam in their war with Mysore to recover previously lost territories . 
 = = = Early campaigns = = = 
 Tensions between Tipu and the Nizam and the British were raised when , in 1788 , the East India Company gained control over the <unk> of Guntur , the southernmost of the Northern Circars , pursuant to an earlier agreement with the Nizam . In exchange , the company agreed to station some of its troops with the Hyderabadi army . By 1789 , tensions between Tipu and his neighbors and vassals to Mysore 's west , including the Kingdom of Travancore , also rose noticeably . Travancore , listed in the 1784 treaty as a British ally , acquired from the Dutch East India Company two forts located within the territory of Cochin , a Mysorean vassal state . The Dutch had never paid tribute to anyone for these forts since gaining control of them , but the fact that they were within Cochin 's bounds was sufficient for Tipu to dispute Travancore 's claim . He began massing troops at Coimbatore and making threatening gestures toward Dharma Raja of Travancore . British authorities in Madras warned Tipu that acts of aggression against Travancore would be met with a British response , and Cornwallis began urging John Holland , the governor of Madras , to begin military preparations . On December 29 , 1789 , Tipu attacked Travancore 's defenses . <unk> , however , was not a military man , and rather than acting with vigour , he temporised and attempted negotiation with Tipu . He was replaced in early 1790 by General William Medows , to whom Cornwallis gave the authority for a military campaign against Mysore . Cornwallis began negotiating with the Marathas and the Nizam for their support , since the British forces in India were significantly lacking in cavalry , one of Tipu 's strengths . The Marathas and the Nizam both had significant cavalry forces , and they were interested in recovering territories lost to Mysore in earlier conflicts . However , they were too weak to attack Mysore individually , and did not trust each other , so they preferred to wait until it was clear the British were committed to act against Mysore . 
 Medows ' campaign in 1790 was a limited success . He occupied the Coimbatore district against minimal opposition , but a forceful counterattack by Tipu reduced the British holdings to Coimbatore itself and a few other outposts . Tipu had also descended to the coastal plain , where he plowed through the Carnatic and even met with the French at Pondicherry in a fruitless attempt to draw them into the conflict . By September 1790 the British allies were taking the field , but still did not want to face Tipu 's strong force without significant British support . Consequently , Cornwallis decided to personally take control of the main British force from Medows . In early February 1791 he began a campaign that was squarely targeted at Mysore 's capital , Seringapatam . 
 = = = First campaign against Seringapatam = = = 
 One of the largest issues confronting Cornwallis in managing the army was its diversity . In addition to British Army and East India Company European forces , there were German troops from Hanover , and a large number of native sepoys from a diversity of cultural backgrounds , speaking different languages and having varied religious and dietary requirements . In order to meet the needs of this patchwork of forces , the army was followed by a number of camp followers that was unusually large by comparison to typical European or North American armies , further increasing the need for reliable supply . The army he took over from General Medows had 15 @,@ 000 troops and 60 @,@ 000 camp followers . He permitted the artist Robert Home to accompany the army on its campaign ; the resulting artwork is one of the legacies of the campaign . 
 Cornwallis was sensitive to the fact that Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions , and made arrangements for a large supply of provisions , and arranged for the use of elephants to assist in the movement of the army 's siege equipment . He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as quickly as possible , so that he could take advantage of their cavalry . 
 Cornwallis departed <unk> , near Madras , on 5 February , reaching Vellore on 11 February . After several days of rest , the army set out with the apparent intention of crossing the Eastern Ghats directly west of Vellore . However , this was a feint , and Cornwallis turned the army north , and instead crossed the mountains at <unk> . Tipu , who had taken steps to defend the more southerly passes , had not defended this one , and the army met no resistance . In fact , it met no significant resistance until it neared Bangalore , one of the strongest fortresses in eastern Mysore . On 5 March , Colonel John Floyd , leader of the British cavalry , was lured into a trap set by Tipu that cost the army 70 men and 250 valuable horses . Cornwallis brushed off the loss , and proceeded to besiege Bangalore . On 7 March the city 's walls were breached , and the city was stormed through the opening , sending its defenders scurrying . Cornwallis gained control of the whole city except its fortress , which was stormed on the night of 21 March after its walls were breached . Tipu , from his camps outside the city , offered only weak resistance , ineffectually attempting to impede the siege works and assist the besieged fortress during the final assault . 
 After securing Bangalore , Cornwallis began to move against Tipu , who retreated toward Seringapatam . The lack of cavalry , however , hampered the British effort , so Cornwallis ordered the army north to make junction with the nizam 's troops . When they finally met about 60 miles ( 97 km ) from Bangalore , Cornwallis described Teige Wunt 's cavalry as " extremely defective in almost every point of military discipline " , and their presence in the army ultimately presented more difficulties than assistance . Instead of acting as flanking companies and foraging on their own , they preferred to remain with the main army and consume its provisions . This forced Cornwallis to alter the army 's route again to join with a supply train carrying additional provisions . The army returned to Bangalore on 28 April , and then set out for Seringapatam . 
 The march was significantly slowed by early monsoon rains that turned the march into a muddy mess . In spite of appeals by Cornwallis to Teige Wunt , the nizam 's men continued to consume provisions , and the army 's provisions began to run short . Tipu retreated before the army , employing scorched earth tactics to deny his enemy provisions . Baggage was left behind as draft animals died , and the army , including its officers , were on half rations . The rains flooded the Kaveri River , which was difficult to cross even under favourable conditions , and which separated the army from a British force under Robert Abercromby that was waiting on the far side of Seringapatam for Cornwallis 's arrival . 
 On 13 May , near the village of <unk> , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) below Seringapatam , Tipu decided to offer battle from a position on nearby heights . In the ensuing battle , complicated by the rains , Cornwallis prevailed , routing Tipu 's forces , which retreated into Seringapatam . Following the battle , Cornwallis made the difficult decision to retreat , as the army 's supply situation had become so desperate that a siege would have been impossible , even if he could have joined with Abercromby 's troops . A hoped @-@ for junction with Marathan troops also seemed unlikely , as Tipu had successfully prevented communication and intelligence of their position from reaching Cornwallis , and the most recent reports placed them some distance off . After ordering Abercromby to retreat on 21 May , Cornwallis ordered his siege train destroyed , and began to retreat toward Bangalore on 26 May . That very day , he was met by an advance company of the Marathan army . The next day that army , totalling some 40 @,@ 000 cavalry , joined with his . The Marathan army was well @-@ provisioned , so they were able to relieve some of the British army 's stresses , although the prices they charged for their provisions were exorbitant . The combined army reached Bangalore on 11 July . Tipu took advantage of the retreat to make a concerted attack on Coimbatore , which fell after a lengthy siege in November . 
 = = = Second campaign against Seringapatam = = = 
 The armies of <unk> <unk> and Teige Wunt then left the grand army to pursue territorial gains in Mysore 's northern territories . Whereas the earl 's younger brother , Commodore William Cornwallis , was engaged in the naval Battle of Tellicherry , Cornwallis spent the remainder of 1791 securing his supply lines to Madras , and clearing the way to Seringapatam . To this end he laid siege to <unk> in November and <unk> in December , both of which fell after unexpectedly modest efforts . He also ordered a massive supply operation to ensure that adequate supplies and pay for his army and those of the allies would be available . Spies were sent to infiltrate Tipu 's camps , and he began to receive more reliable reports of the latter 's troop strengths and disposition . 
 The relations between Cornwallis and the allies were difficult . The <unk> military leaders , <unk> <unk> and Hurry Punt , had to be bribed to stay with the army , and Cornwallis reported the Hyderabadi forces to be more of a hindrance than a help ; one British observer wrote that they were a " disorderly rabble " and " not very creditable to the state of military discipline at Hyderabad . " 
 On 25 January , Cornwallis moved from <unk> toward Seringapatam , while Abercromby again advanced from the Malabar coast . Although Tipu 's men harassed the column , they did not impede its progress , and it reached the Mysorean capital on 5 February . Cornwallis established a chain of outposts to protect the supply line from Bangalore , and planned an attack for that night , even though Abercromby had not yet arrived . Cornwallis responded with a night @-@ time attack to dislodge Tipu from his lines . After a somewhat confused battle , Tipu 's forces were flanked , he retreated into the city , and Cornwallis began siege operations . On 12 February Abercromby arrived with the Bombay army , and the noose began to tighten around Tipu . By 23 February , Tipu began making overtures for peace talks , and hostilities were suspended the next day when he agreed to preliminary terms . 
 Among the preliminary terms that Cornwallis insisted on was the Tipu surrender two of his sons as hostages as a guarantee for his execution of the agreed terms . On 26 February his two young sons were formally delivered to Cornwallis amid great ceremony and gun salutes by both sides . Cornwallis , who was not interested in significantly extending the company 's territory , or in turning most of Mysore over to the <unk> and Hyderabad , negotiated a division of one half of Mysorean territory , to be divided by the allies , in which the company 's acquisition would improve its defenses . He later wrote , " If we had taken Seringapatam and killed Tippoo , [ ... ] we must either have given that capital to the <unk> ( a dangerous boon ) or have set up some miserable pageant of our own , to be supported by the Company 's troops and treasures , and to be plundered by its servants . " The territories taken deprived Mysore of much of its coastline ; Mysore was also obligated to pay some of the allied war costs . On 18 March 1792 Tipu agreed to the terms and signed the Treaty of Seringapatam , ending hostilities . 
 = = Departure = = 
 The difficulties of the military campaigns took a great physical toll on Cornwallis , and he sought to return to England . John Shore , his replacement , did not arrive until March 1793 , and Cornwallis remained until August to assist in the transition . He also oversaw the capture of the French outpost at Pondicherry following the arrival of news that war had again broken out in Europe . On 14 August 1793 , without ceremony , he quietly sailed from Calcutta for Madras , and on 10 October he finally sailed for England on board the Swallow . 
 = = After India = = 
 Scholar P.J. Marshall explains that the British public were able to follow the Third Mysore War in newspapers " in much greater detail than would have been the case for any previous war in India . " Thus , when Cornwallis returned victorious from India , he was celebrated well beyond Parliamentary and Company circles . He was raised to Marquess , but was also celebrated publicly through commissioned portraits and statues ; published books , songs and poems ; and even purchasable medallions and tea trays . This was the first time a military victory in India at the expense of a non @-@ European enemy garnered such public praise . While there would be many more bumps along the way , such widespread enthusiasm marked a turning point towards British acceptance of an overseas empire of conquest . 
 Cornwallis was immediately asked to return to India . One reform that Cornwallis had been unable to achieve was the harmonisation of pay and rank between the military forces of the company and those of the Crown . Company officers of a given rank were generally paid better than those of a comparable rank in the Crown forces , and proposals to merge their pay scales were met with resistance that bordered on mutiny . The company directors asked Cornwallis to deal with this ; he refused . 
 After serving for several years as the Master of the Ordnance , he was asked by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger to serve as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland as well as its Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief after the Irish Rebellion of 1798 broke out . While the rebellion was mostly put down before his arrival , he oversaw the mopping of the remaining pockets of rebellion , and successfully defeated a French invasion intended to foment further rebellious activity . He then worked to secure the passage by the Irish Parliament of the 1800 Act of Union , which joined the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . He resigned his posts when the king refused to support Catholic emancipation , which he viewed as a key element for securing an enduring peace in Ireland . 
 He was then engaged by the king in diplomatic efforts in Europe . Cornwallis led the British diplomatic team whose negotiations with Napoleon resulted in the 1802 Treaty of Amiens , with Cornwallis signing the treaty on behalf of King George . 
 = = Return to India = = 
 In the years since he left India , the company 's reach and control over the country had increased significantly , mainly under the governorship of Lord Mornington . Wellesley had decisively defeated Tipu in 1799 , and gained control , direct and indirect , over most of southern India . In 1803 the company came into conflict with the Marathas , and Mornington began extending the company 's reach further into the northern territories . His liberal spending and aggressive methods for dealing with the Marathas were not appreciated by the company 's directors , and following military setbacks in 1804 and allegations of improprieties , the directors decided to replace him . 
 On 7 January 1805 Cornwallis was again appointed to the positions of Governor General and Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of India ; he described that after a difficult passage , he reached Madras on 19 July , and on 30 July he resumed his duties . William Hickey wrote that Cornwallis had become " a wreck of what he had been when formerly in Bengal " , and another aide noted that " his constitution was less equal to contend against the effects of this climate " . In spite of declining health and mental faculties , Cornwallis began a trip by boat to visit army outposts northwest of Calcutta . On the journey he wrote to General Gerard Lake , then commanding the forces in the war with the Marathas , insisting that peace be made . However , he never received Lake 's answer . When Cornwallis reached Ghazipur on 27 September , he was too ill to proceed further , and he died there a week later , on 5 October 1805 .

 Biographers Franklin and Mary Wickwire note that Cornwallis 's attitudes towards governance presaged the idea of responsible government that took hold in the United Kingdom in the 19th century . Later British administrators and the Indian Civil Service adopted his ideas of service by example , and service for the overall benefit of the population . Historian Marguerite Wilbur called the era of Cornwallis and Mornington the Golden Age of British rule in India . 
 Cornwallis 's grave at Ghazipur is marked by a mausoleum whose construction was begun in 1809 . Memorials were also erected in his honour in Bombay , Madras , and in Saint Paul 's Cathedral in London . In Calcutta , when Mornington greatly expanded the government facilities , the Town Hall included a statuary hall . In 1803 , a sculpture begun by John Bacon and finished by his son John Bacon , Jr. was erected there in Cornwallis 's honour . The sculpture now stands in the Victoria Memorial .

 SMS Prinzess Wilhelm ( " His Majesty 's Ship Princess Wilhelm " ) was a protected cruiser of the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . She was the second Irene @-@ class cruiser ; her only sister ship was SMS Irene . Prinzess Wilhelm was laid down in 1886 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel , launched in September 1887 , and commissioned into the fleet in November 1889 . As built , the ship was armed with a main battery of fourteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns and had a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 In 1895 , Prinzess Wilhelm was deployed to East Asian waters , where she frequently served as the flagship of the East Asia Cruiser Division . She was one of the three ships that participated in the seizure of Kiaochou Bay under the command of Rear Admiral Otto von Diederichs . She subsequently was present in the Philippines in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Manila Bay between American and Spanish squadrons during the Spanish – American War in 1898 . Prinzess Wilhelm returned to Germany in 1899 and was modernized in 1899 – 1903 . She was reduced to a mine hulk in February 1914 and ultimately broken up for scrap in 1922 .

These provided a top speed of 18 kn ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) and a range of approximately 2 @,@ 490 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 610 km ; 2 @,@ 870 mi ) at 9 kn ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . She had a crew of 28 officers and 337 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with four 15 cm K L / 30 guns in single pedestal mounts , supplied with 400 rounds of ammunition in total . They had a range of 8 @,@ 500 m ( 27 @,@ 900 ft ) . Prinzess Wilhelm also carried ten shorter @-@ barreled 15 cm K L / 22 guns in single mounts . These guns had a much shorter range , at 5 @,@ 400 m ( 17 @,@ 700 ft ) . The gun armament was rounded out by six 3 @.@ 7 cm revolver cannon . She was also equipped with three 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes , two launchers were mounted on the deck and the third was in the bow , below the waterline . In 1893 , the ship was modernized in Wilhelmshaven in 1903 ; work lasted until 1905 . The ship 's armament was significantly improved ; the four L / 30 guns were replaced with a new model with an increased range of 10 @,@ 000 m ( 33 @,@ 000 ft ) . Eight 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 35 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns were installed in place of the L / 22 guns , and six 5 cm SK L / 10 QF guns were added .

 In the first maneuvers of 1890 , the newly commissioned Prinzess Wilhelm operated as the opposing force with several old corvettes . In September 1892 , the ship was sent to Genoa to represent Germany in the 400th anniversary of the voyage of Christopher Columbus . She was the only German ship sent to the ceremonies , a result of cooling relations between Germany and Italy at the time . In the 1894 autumn maneuvers , Prinzess Wilhelm served as the flagship of a reconnaissance flotilla . In January 1895 , Prinzess Wilhelm was dispatched to Asian to reinforce the Cruiser Division stationed there . After she joined her sister Irene in East Asian waters , the Division was reinforced with the rebuilt old ironclad Kaiser , the light cruiser Cormoran , the corvette Arcona , and the gunboat Iltis . In June 1896 , Alfred von Tirpitz took command of the Cruiser Division . By November , Prinzess Wilhelm was in bad need of maintenance , as engine problems limited her to half @-@ speed . 
 In June 1897 , Rear Admiral Otto von Diederichs arrived in Asia to take command of the Cruiser Division ; Prinzess Wilhelm , Irene , and Arcona were in Chefoo conducting gunnery training . Diederichs , aboard Kaiser , joined the rest of the Division in Chefoo at the end of the month . There , he held a series of ceremonial visits with the captains of each of his ships . On 1 July , Diederichs boarded Prinzess Wilhelm to make a visit to the Chinese capital at Peking . There , he attempted to negotiate with the Chinese government to acquire a permanent naval base for the Cruiser Division . Diederichs , who sought the port of Kiaochou , was unsuccessful in his attempt , and so he returned to Prinzess Wilhelm on 11 July . While leaving Peking , he examined the Taku Forts that guarded the entrance to Peking . Diederichs returned to the Division on 16 July , after which he conducted a tour of Asian ports with the entire Division . 
 = = = Seizure of Kiaochou = = = 
 In October , Diederichs planned to rotate his ships through repair facilities in the region for periodic maintenance ; Prinzess Wilhelm was scheduled to dock in Shanghai . He requested permission to take Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser to Kiaochou for autumn gunnery training and to leave Prinzess Wilhelm stationed there during the winter , which was denied . Diederichs was able to make use of the murder of a pair of German priests on 6 November in <unk> , however , to justify his move against Kiaochou . At the time , the only ships available for the attack were Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser . Cormoran joined the two ships after a few days , and by 10 November , the ships were ready . Prinzess Wilhelm left port on the 11th , to rendezvous with Kaiser and Cormoran at sea . 
 On the night 12 November , the three ships met and formed into line ; the attack was scheduled to begin on the morning of 14 November with a bombardment from the warships . The crews of Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser were to form a landing party to seize the harbor . The flotilla arrived on the morning of the 13th . The following morning , the landing party of some 700 officers and men was landed on the main pier in the harbor . The Chinese were caught completely by surprise , and the Germans secured their objectives within two hours ; Diederichs convinced the Chinese commander , General Chang , to withdraw from Kiaochou . The Imperial flag was raised in the town and Prinzess Wilhelm fired a 21 @-@ gun salute . The landing party remained in Kiaochou to garrison the port , and several 3 @.@ 7 cm guns were removed from the ships to provide artillery to the force . 
 Diederichs requested reinforcements from Germany , and the Kaiser authorized a second Division to deploy to the East Asia station . The unit was therefore reorganized as the East Asia Squadron ; Prinzess Wilhelm was assigned to the I Division of the Squadron . On 27 November , Diederichs was promoted to Vice Admiral for his success in seizing Kiaochou , and given command of the new Squadron . Chinese forces converged on the port by the end of the month . Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser moved into the harbor to provide artillery support . General Chang , who had been placed under house arrest , was discovered to have been attempting to subvert the German occupation ; <unk> therefore placed him under arrest aboard Prinzess Wilhelm . A brief skirmish ensued , which quickly resulted in a Chinese rout . On 8 January , a force of 50 men from Prinzess Wilhelm 's crew was sent to Chi @-@ mo to defend against Chinese raids in the area .

 In the Spring of 1898 , Prince Heinrich arrived in Asia . While awaiting his arrival , Diederichs planned to rotate his ships through dockyards for periodic maintenance . On 4 May , Diederichs made Prinzess Wilhelm his flagship and sent Kaiser to Nagasaki and followed the next day , after Prince Heinrich reached Kiaochou . The Spanish – American War had broken out on 25 April and Commodore George Dewey had defeated the Spanish squadron at the Battle of Manila Bay on 1 May . Diederichs planned to use the crisis as an opportunity to seize another base for the Squadron in Asia . Upon arriving in Nagasaki , Diederichs learned the shipyard had not yet completed repairs to Kaiser , and so was unable to refit Prinzess Wilhelm for some time . He therefore ordered Kaiserin Augusta to meet him in Nagasaki , which he would use as his temporary flagship . Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser were to rejoin Diederichs once their repairs were completed . 
 On 20 June , Prinzess Wilhelm arrived in the Philippines ; Diederichs now had a force of five warships : Prinzess Wilhelm , Kaiser , Irene , Kaiserin Augusta , and Cormoran . After her arrival , Prinzess Wilhelm proceeded to Mariveles to replenish her coal supplies and receive new crewmen from the transport Darmstadt . On 9 August , the American squadron in the Bay ordered the neutral warships in the harbor to leave the bombardment zone , and so Prinzess Wilhelm and the other German ships went to Mariveles . Following the fall of the city , most of the German ships departed the Philippines ; only Prinzess Wilhelm remained on station to protect German nationals in the islands . She was replaced by Arcona in October . In mid @-@ November , Kaiser ran aground and had to go into drydock for repairs ; Diederichs therefore made Prinzess Wilhelm his flagship . The ship remained in Asia for only a few more months , returning to European waters in 1899 . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 After returning to Germany in 1899 , she went into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven for modernization ; work lasted until 1902 . She was stricken from the naval register on 17 February 1914 and used as a mine hulk . She was initially based in Danzig , but later moved to Kiel and Wilhelmshaven . On 26 November 1921 , Prinzess Wilhelm was sold for 909 @,@ 000 Marks . She was broken up the following year in Wilhelmshaven . 
 = Ratchet & Clank ( 2002 video game ) = 
 Ratchet & Clank is a 2002 3D platform video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 . Ratchet & Clank is the first game in the Ratchet & Clank series and precedes Ratchet & Clank : Going Commando . 
 The game follows the anthropomorphic character Ratchet meeting the robot Clank on his home planet . Clank discovers that the villainous Chairman Drek of the Blarg race plans to create a new planet for his species , destroying other planets in the process . Clank convinces Ratchet to help him in his mission to gain the help of the famous superhero Captain Qwark . 
 The game offers a wide range of weapons and gadgets that the player must use to defeat numerous enemies and solve puzzles on a variety of different planets in the fictional " Solana " galaxy . The game also includes several mini @-@ games , such as racing or hacking , which the player must complete to proceed . The game was positively received by critics , who praised the graphics and variety of gameplay , along with the comic and humorous style to the sci @-@ fi story . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Ratchet & Clank , the main playable character is Ratchet , whom the player controls from a third @-@ person perspective , though a first person mode to view the player 's surroundings is available . The player traverses diverse environments with a large collection of unusual gadgets and weapons , using them to defeat enemies and pass obstacles . Up to 36 weapons and gadgets can be bought or found in the game . 
 The player begins the game with only two weapons : the " <unk> 8000 " , a standard melee weapon with a variety of uses such as interacting with puzzles in the environment , and the Bomb Glove , a short @-@ range grenade thrower . As missions are completed across the game 's various planets , more weapons and gadgets become available , including the Blaster , an automatic pistol ; the <unk> , a flamethrower ; and the Suck Cannon , a vacuum gun , which sucks up smaller enemies and converts them into projectiles . Weapons are either found , or can be bought with bolts , the game 's form of currency . The <unk> remains the standard melee weapon for close combat , with its own button , as all other weapons assume the role of secondary weaponry and can only be equipped one at a time , though all weapons can be carried in the player 's inventory . 
 Bolts can be found in crates , along with ammo , or dropped from defeated enemies . The player also needs to buy ammo for most weapons , but a small number can function without the need for ammo . Vendors , which sell weapons and ammo , are situated at strategic points throughout levels . After completing the game , the player may choose to enter " challenge mode " , in which the game 's difficulty level rises considerably , but all bolts and weapons acquired the first time are carried through . There is also the option to buy " gold weapons " , more powerful versions of existing weapons . The game 's health system , <unk> , starts at four health bubbles equivalent to be able to take four hits , but upgrades can be purchased , giving the player a total of eight hit points . 
 Normally , Clank rides on Ratchet 's back , acting as a jet @-@ pack or similar device . Occasionally , however , Clank becomes a playable character when Ratchet is unable to explore certain areas . Clank can control " <unk> " , smaller robots similar to Clank , who perform certain actions for him . Racing , in the form of <unk> races , appears in the game . Some racing missions are necessary to progress in the game , while others are optional . One level of space combat and a level of flying through the air shooting tankers is also present . Mini @-@ games to unlock doors , extend bridges , or elevate platforms appear in most levels . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On the desolate planet of <unk> , a mysterious factory is busy churning out mechanical soldiers . A flaw in the manufacturing instructions produces XJ @-@ <unk> , a small , self @-@ aware robot who quickly discovers the factory 's true purpose . He steals a ship and tries to escape , but is soon shot down over the desert planet of Veldin . Ratchet , a young Lombax ( a cat @-@ like alien ) who lives alone , investigates the crash site and rescues XJ @-@ <unk> , whom he nicknames " Clank " . Clank reveals that he was created by the Blarg , an alien race led by the corrupt Chairman Drek . Having ruined their home planet of <unk> through uncontrolled industrialization , the Blarg intend to create a new homeworld by systematically harvesting large portions of other planets , killing their inhabitants . Ratchet offers to help him as long as Clank agrees to serve as the ignition system for his ship , which Clank accepts . 
 Shortly after takeoff , the duo is shot down over <unk> , which has already fallen to the Blarg . After getting another ship from the <unk> chairman , they travel to several different planets looking for information on the whereabouts of legendary space ranger Captain Qwark , who Clank believes is their only hope to stop Drek . They trace him to a racetrack on <unk> , where Qwark offers to train them as rangers at his private compound on <unk> . After surviving a deadly obstacle course , Qwark reveals that he works for Drek , and leaves them to die in a pit holding a deadly <unk> <unk> , which they manage to kill . Ratchet , who had always mistrusted Qwark , blames Clank for being naive , to which Clank responds by calling him a coward for putting his personal feelings ahead of the galaxy 's survival . Despite their mutual distrust , the two continue to fight the Blarg , forcing Drek to send Qwark to destroy them with his personal warship . Following a brutal dogfight in an asteroid belt , Qwark is defeated and Ratchet and Clank patch up their friendship . 
 With his new planet nearly complete , Drek orders the destruction of <unk> so that he can move it into the planet 's ideal orbit . The duo successfully destroy the warhead built for this purpose , so Drek unveils his ultimate weapon : the <unk> , a laser capable of reducing a planet to molecules . Learning that his new target is Ratchet 's home of Veldin , the two heroes sabotage his fleet and confront the Chairman himself on the surface . Drek admits that he was responsible for <unk> 's ecological destruction , which he engineered to force the Blarg to settle on his artificial planet for inflated prices , and that he intends to repeat the process over and over again until the entire galaxy is destroyed . Ratchet launches Drek into space , killing him when he collides with his new planet , and then destroys it with the <unk> . The planetary fragments raining down upon Veldin knock both Clank and Ratchet off the platform , but Clank grabs a ledge in an attempt to save them both , injuring his arm in the process . He is unable to pull himself and Ratchet up to safety , but manages to break their fall using his thruster @-@ pack . Although the initial purpose of their partnership is done , Ratchet and Clank set aside their differences and Ratchet takes Clank home with him to fix his arm , ultimately strengthening their bond and friendship . In a post @-@ credits scene , Ratchet and Clank ( whose arm has been repaired ) watch an informercial featuring the now @-@ disgraced Qwark , who advertises a product to improve one 's hygiene , which he demonstrates , but this greatly disgusts the duo . Clank immediately turns off the television , ending the game . 
 = = Development and release = = 
 After finishing work on the Spyro the Dragon series , Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed <unk> ( Insomniac game # 5 ) for the PlayStation 2 . The developers , however , were never enthusiastic about it , and the idea was dropped after six months . Ratchet & Clank was based on an idea by Brian Hastings , which would feature a space @-@ traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game ; Ratchet 's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures , including dogs and rats ; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility . Another early idea was to have a number of small robots attached to Ratchet , which would perform different functions . However , Insomniac realized that having the three robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet 's appearance , leading them to have only one robot , Clank . Very little was cut for the final product , apart from a few weapons and gadgets that " just weren 't fun " . 
 Shortly after changing the game from <unk> to Ratchet & Clank , Naughty Dog asked Insomniac if they would be interested in sharing the game technology used in Naughty Dog 's Jak and Daxter : The Precursor Legacy , asking that Insomniac in turn share with them any improvements that were made . Insomniac agreed , resulting in most of the Ratchet & Clank engine technology being developed in @-@ house by Insomniac , but some very important <unk> were those developed by Naughty Dog . Looking back on the agreement , Ted Price said that " Naughty Dog 's generosity gave us a huge leg up and allowed us to draw the enormous vistas in the game . " Some years later , Ted Price clarified Insomniac 's stance on engine technology while obliquely mentioning the shared <unk> : 
 " We 've always developed all our own technology . It 's been a little frustrating in the past for us to hear people say , ' Oh yeah , the Insomniac game is running on the Naughty Dog engine . ' People assumed that we were using Naughty Dog 's engine for Ratchet , and that was not true . We shared some technology with Naughty Dog way back when , and that was great , but we are a company that puts stock in developing specialized technology and we will continue to do so . " -- Ted Price , Independent PlayStation Magazine , September 2006 
 Pre @-@ production of the game began in late March 2001 , with a team of approximately 35 people . The game went into production in November 2001 , and by the end of the project , the team had grown to 45 . The game was first released in North America on November 4 , 2002 , and then in Australia on November 6 , 2002 . It was later released in PAL regions on November 8 , 2002 , and in Japan on December 3 , 2002 . In November 2003 , Sony added Ratchet & Clank to their Greatest hits series of games for the PlayStation 2 when Ratchet & Clank : Going Commando was released at that time , and the game was similarly added to Sony 's Platinum Range used in the PAL region on August 22 , 2003 . The game was added to Japan 's The Best range on July 3 , 2003 ; it was also the only game to be bundled with the PlayStation 2 in Japan .

 Ratchet & Clank was met with positive reviews from critics upon release . After playing a preview of the game , GameSpot described it as having " excellent graphics , varied gameplay , and tight control [ s ] " . The game 's use of weapons , rather than simple melee attacks , was cited as one of the main features that made it stand out from other platform games ; Computer and Video Games said that " Going berserk with your giant ratchet [ ... ] is seriously satisfying [ ... ] Every time you thump an enemy with the hefty tool , it looks , sounds and feels remarkably solid . [ ... ] What 's more , the same can be said for all the other weapons you collect and use over the course of your intergalactic adventure " . GameSpot noted that the player does not need to follow the same paths multiple times , as was common in platformers at the time . Gameplanet said that it was " Quite simply the best platform game on the PS2 right now and possibly the best on any format ! " 
 Reviewers praised the game 's graphics , specifically pointing out the character and background designs as being high @-@ quality for PS2 games of the time . GameSpy called the graphics " mind @-@ blowing " , and GameSpot praised the game 's smooth frame rate . GameZone noted the animation of Ratchet , praising the details in his animation . Reviewers found that the game 's voice overs and other audio elements were generally well @-@ done . IGN commented on the game 's artificial intelligence , saying that it was not as well @-@ done as that of Jak and Daxter : The Precursor Legacy , but still " purposefully comic and somewhat sophisticated " in others . Gameplanet felt that the game 's levels were well laid @-@ out . 
 Criticism was aimed at the game 's camera angles , which Eurogamer felt were " idiotic " at times , giving the example of boss fights in which the camera centers on the boss rather than being freely movable . Allgame found that it was hard to form an emotional bond with Ratchet & Clank 's main characters , saying that Ratchet is " your typical teenager [ ... ] who desires nothing more than excitement and adventure " and that Clank is " the stereotypical intellectual ; stuffy and almost prudish to a fault " , feeling instead that the characters of Jak and Daxter from Jak and Daxter : The Precursor Legacy were " infinitely more likeable . " Some criticisms were also aimed at the story , with GameSpy saying that the game became predictable , boring , and " just bland " . Reviewers also noted that the first half of the game was " yawn inducing " , but once the player reaches planet <unk> , it becomes much more intense and difficult ; GamePro found that the player does not " engage a single thought process " for the first parts of the game .

 In June 2014 , it was announced that the game would be re @-@ imagined for the PlayStation 4 , with the intention of remaking the original game as if Insomniac Games were to make the game again today . It has also been confirmed that the re @-@ imagining will tie @-@ in with the upcoming film . The game was originally planned to be released on the PlayStation 4 in 2015 , but was delayed along with the film to April 12 , 2016 . 
 = Revelations ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Revelations " is the eleventh episode of the third season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on December 15 , 1995 . It was written by Kim Newton and directed by David Nutter . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Revelations " earned a Nielsen household rating of 10 , being watched by 15 @.@ 25 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mixed to positive reviews . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate a case where fake <unk> are being murdered . When a boy shows signs of being a real stigmatic , Mulder and Scully attempt to protect him , fearing that he will be the latest victim . 
 " Revelations " became a minor storyline milestone for the series with the exploration of Scully 's faith as a devout Roman Catholic . Throughout the remainder of the series , her Catholic faith served as a cornerstone , although at times a contradiction to her otherwise rigid skepticism of the paranormal . Furthermore , while Mulder is usually the believer and Scully is usually the skeptic , " Revelations " features a role reversal with Scully becoming the believer and Mulder becoming the skeptic , a move that Duchovny called " a refreshing change of pace . "

Kevin arrives at his home and is pursued by Gates , who kills Owen when he arrives to protect him . Scully performs an autopsy and finds that Owen 's corpse is not decaying , reminding her of " <unk> " that she learned about in Catechism .

 " Revelations " was written by Kim Newton , who would go on to write one further episode of The X @-@ Files : the third season 's " Quagmire " . The episode was directed by David Nutter and would be his final episode of The X @-@ Files . Nutter decided that , after the episode , he wished to pursue different things and that the series was in excellent hands with fellow directors Rob Bowman and Kim Manners . Actor Kenneth Welsh appears in the episode as the demonic Simon Gates . Welsh had previously appeared with Duchovny in the critically acclaimed 1990 serial drama Twin Peaks . 
 The episode features a role reversal with Dana Scully the believer and Fox Mulder the skeptic , which David Duchovny called " a refreshing change of pace . " Nutter said that dealing with faith permitted the show 's creators to further delve into Scully 's character . The episode was the first to discuss Scully 's faith in @-@ depth . Series creator Chris Carter later emphasized that the theme of the episode was more on personal belief rather than organized religion , noting , " [ The episode ] deals with faith , not religion with a capital ' R ' or Catholicism with a capital ' C ' " . The producers for the series were cautious about presenting an overtly religious episode of the series for fear of " pissing certain people off " , but , according to Carter , the show " handled it in such a way as to make it about miracle belief , or lack of belief . " 
 According to co @-@ producer Paul Rabwin the episode had script problems and went through several rewrites while the episode was still in production . The producers felt it was difficult to sell the concept of religious magic and having Kevin appear in two places at once . The episode went through a detailed editing process , which including additional tweaks to the script . These changes required actor Kevin <unk> to be flown back to Vancouver to film additional scenes . The producers claimed to be in awe by the way the episode turned out after all the additional work had been done . Several of the scenes were altered or cut during post @-@ production . The producers were unhappy with the voice of the priest in the final scene , resulting in them using a new vocal track in post @-@ production . A scene with Kevin 's father speaking in tongues — as well as quoting the famous " Klaatu barada nikto " line from The Day the Earth Stood Still — was cut in the final edit of the episode .

 " Revelations " premiered on the Fox network on December 15 , 1995 . This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10 , with a 17 share , meaning that roughly 10 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 17 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . This totaled 15 @.@ 25 million viewers . 
 Critical reception to the episode was moderately positive . Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B + and wrote positively of Scully 's portrayal , noting " Really , this works best as a Scully episode . I prefer Darin Morgan 's version of the character [ ... ] , but I doubt that version could support a full episode about God in the same way that this more searching , and lost , Scully does . " However , Handlen was critical of some of the religious aspects of the episode , noting that " If there 's a Christian God in the X @-@ Files universe , doesn 't that trump just about everything else that Mulder and Scully have spent their time on ? ... There are too many implications here for the show to support , and while it doesn 't destroy the episode , it does make it difficult for me to back it as fully as I 'd like to . " John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating , noting " Overall , this episode highlights Scully and her faith , and in the process , manages to presage many of the future plot developments for the series and her character . The spiritual war at the foundation of the series mythology is reflected in a situation that speaks directly to Scully and her upbringing , and though some of the religious metaphors are heavy @-@ handed , it works well enough . " Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B + and wrote positively of the episode 's " inventiveness , " which " derives from its choice of the most mainstream <unk> of all — Christianity . " The review also wrote positively of the Mulder @-@ Scully role reversal , calling the change " always welcome " . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . She noted that " Scully 's search to reconcile her religious beliefs and her scientific training makes for powerful drama , and Gillian Anderson is up to the challenge . " Vitaris , however , criticized elements of the plot , most notably the " un @-@ saintly " quality of Kevin and Kevin 's lack of emotion after his mother is killed . Furthermore , she called the ending " a real mess " . Not all reviews were positive . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode two stars out of five , and called it a " peculiarly bloodless episode " . The two wrote that many of the traits possessed by Kevin were only helpful in certain isolated scenes , such as the ability to <unk> . Shearman and Pearson concluded that the show should " take a serious subject by all means , but then take the subject seriously . " 
 Director David Nutter was pleased with the finished product . He was most notably happy with Anderson 's acting , saying that she delivered a sparkling performance , particularly in the final scene . He also stated " I really love working with Gillian . She 's got such an ability to emote and give from the inside . " 
 Actor Michael Berryman has said that this was his favorite role in his career and credits it for reversing typecasting that always put him in the role of the monster . 
 = Erschallet , ihr Lieder , erklinget , ihr Saiten ! BWV 172 = 
 Erschallet , ihr Lieder , erklinget , ihr Saiten ! , BWV 172 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach , composed in Weimar in 1714 for Pentecost Sunday . Bach led the first performance on 20 May 1714 in the Schlosskirche , the court chapel in the ducal Schloss . Erschallet , ihr Lieder is an early work in a genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year . The title , pronounced [ <unk> ̯ <unk> <unk> ̯ <unk> <unk> ̯ <unk> <unk> ̯ <unk> ̯ <unk> ̩ ] , translates as " Ring out , you songs ; sound , you strings ! " 
 Bach was appointed Konzertmeister in Weimar in the spring of 1714 , a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month . He composed Erschallet , ihr Lieder as the third cantata in the series , to a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck . The text reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit . The librettist included a quotation from the day 's prescribed Gospel reading in the only recitative , and for the closing chorale he used a stanza from Philipp Nicolai 's hymn " Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern " ( 1599 ) . 
 The work is in six movements , and scored for four vocal soloists , four @-@ part choir , three trumpets , timpani , oboe , bassoon and a string orchestra of two violins , two violas , and basso continuo . The orchestra for the holiday occasion is festive compared to the two works previously composed in Weimar . The cantata opens with a chorus , followed by the recitative , in which words spoken by Jesus are sung by the bass as the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) . A bass aria with trumpets addresses the Trinity , and a tenor aria then describes the Spirit that was present at the Creation . This is followed by an intimate duet of the Soul ( soprano ) and the Spirit ( alto ) , to which an oboe plays the ornamented melody of Martin Luther 's hymn " Komm , Heiliger Geist , Herre Gott " and a solo cello provides the bass line . The theme of intimacy between God and Man is developed further in the following chorale , after which Bach specified an unusual repeat of the opening chorus . 
 While Bach served as Thomaskantor – director of church music – in Leipzig from 1723 , he performed the cantata several times , sometimes in a different key and with changes in the scoring . Musicologists agree that he loved the cantata 's Gospel text , " If ye love me ... " , and the Pentecost hymn used in the duet , setting both the text and the hymn several times . John Eliot Gardiner writes that Bach " particularly valued " this cantata . It contains features that he used again in later compositions of cantatas , oratorios and his masses , for example movements with three trumpets and timpani in a triple meter for festive occasions , and duets as a symbol of God and man . 
 = = Background = = 
 Bach is known as a prolific composer of cantatas . When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor ( director of church music ) in Leipzig in 1723 , he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years . 
 Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co @-@ reigning dukes in Saxe @-@ Weimar , Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708 . He had composed sacred cantatas before , some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708 . Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns . Examples include : Aus der Tiefen rufe ich , Herr , zu dir , BWV 131 ; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden , BWV 4 for Easter ; Gott ist mein König , BWV 71 , to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708 ; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral . 
 In Weimar , Bach first concentrated on the organ , composing major works for the instrument , including the Orgelbüchlein , the Toccata and Fugue in D minor , BWV 565 , and the Prelude and Fugue in E major , BWV 566 . Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle , ( " court capelle " or court orchestra ) , and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger , Christoph Graupner , Georg Philipp Telemann , Marco Giuseppe <unk> and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713 . In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias : the so @-@ called Hunting Cantata , BWV 208 , as a homage cantata for Christian , Duke of Saxe @-@ Weissenfels , celebrated on 23 February , and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima ( the second Sunday before Lent ) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt , BWV 18 , on a text by Erdmann Neumeister . 
 In 1713 , he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle , succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow . Zachow had taught the young George Frideric Handel , and composed many church cantatas in the new style , adopting recitatives and arias from the Italian opera . Bach was successful in his application for the position , but declined after Duke Wilhelm Ernst increased his salary and offered him a promotion . 
 Bach was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714 , an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche : With the appointment , he received the title Konzertmeister and new privileges : 
 " das <unk> eines Concert @-@ <unk> mit <unk> Rang nach dem Vice @-@ Capellmeister ... <unk> Er <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , und zu <unk> <unk> die Capell <unk> uf sein Verlangen zu <unk> <unk> ... <unk> <unk> sollen " ( the title of a concert master , next in rank to the vice chapel master ... for which he is to perform new pieces each month , and the chapel musicians shall be under a duty to attend such rehearsals as he may require ) . 
 Circumstances were favourable : Bach enjoyed a " congenial and intimate " space in the court chapel , called <unk> ( Heaven 's Castle ) , and a professional group of musicians in the court capelle . He was inspired by a collaboration with the court poet Salomon Franck , who provided the texts for most of his church cantatas , capturing a " pure , straightforward theological message " in " elegant poetic language " . The first two cantatas Bach composed in Weimar based on Franck 's texts were Himmelskönig , sei willkommen , BWV 182 , for Palm Sunday , which coincided with the Annunciation that year , and Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen , BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday . One month after Erschallet , ihr Lieder , Bach performed Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis , BWV 21 , on the third Sunday after Trinity , again on a text by Franck . Erschallet , ihr Lieder , the third cantata in this series , is the first cantata for a feast day . 
 = = Occasion and words = = 
 Erschallet , ihr Lieder is the third of the Weimar cantatas . It was the first composed for a feast day , Pentecost Sunday ( Whit Sunday ) , Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter . The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles , on the Holy Spirit ( Acts 2 : 1 – 13 ) , and from the Gospel of John , in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach , in his Farewell discourse ( John 14 : 23 – 31 ) . As in many Bach cantatas , the libretto is compiled from Bible text , contemporary poetry and chorale . The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck , although the verses are not included in his printed editions . Several of Bach 's early stylistic mannerisms appear here , such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement , arias following each other without a recitative in between , and dialogue in a duet . 
 Franck 's text shows elements of early Pietism : the expression of extreme feelings , for example " O <unk> Zeiten ! " ( O most blessed times ) in the opening chorus , and a " mystical demeanour " , for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united . In the middle section of the first movement , Franck paraphrases the Gospel text , which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man , to " Gott will sich die Seelen zu <unk> <unk> " ( God Himself shall prepare our souls for His temple , more literally : " God wants to prepare [ our ] souls to become his temples " ) . The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John , " Wer mich liebet , der wird mein Wort halten " ( Whoever loves Me will keep My Word , and My Father will love him , and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him ) . Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation . Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit , underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther 's Pentecost hymn " Komm , Heiliger Geist , Herre Gott " , which is based on the Latin hymn " Veni Sancte Spiritus , <unk> <unk> corda fidelium " . Movement 6 is a chorale , verse four of Philipp Nicolai 's hymn " Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern " . Nicolai 's " <unk> <unk> " ( Spiritual bridal song ) continues the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit . 
 = = Performances and theme = = 
 With Bach 's appointment to concert master and his regular monthly cantata compositions , he achieved permission to hold rehearsals in the church , to ensure high performance standards : " the rehearsing of the pieces at the home [ of the <unk> ] has been changed , and it is ordered that it must always take place at the Kirchen @-@ Capelle [ the music gallery in the palace church ] , and this is also to be observed by the Capellmeister " . The orchestra at his disposition consisted of the members of the court <unk> , three leaders , five singers and seven instrumentalists , augmented on demand by military musicians , town musicians and choristers from a gymnasium . 
 Bach conducted the first performance of Erschallet , ihr Lieder on 20 May 1714 . His son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach remembered that he often conducted and played first violin : " he played the violin cleanly and penetratingly , and thus kept the orchestra in better order than he could have done with the harpsichord " . The parts for the first performance are lost , but the score and performing material for later performances have survived . Bach performed the cantata again , possibly in Köthen between 1717 and 1722 , and several times as Thomaskantor in Leipzig . For the performance on 28 May 1724 , he changed the instrumentation slightly and transposed the work from C major to D major . He reverted to C major for a performance on 13 May 1731 . An organ part for a later performance of movement 5 is extant . 
 John Eliot Gardiner remarked that Bach " particularly valued " this cantata , and that it set " a pattern for his later approaches to the Pentecostal theme " . Bach set the Gospel text of the recitative in a choral movement in other cantatas for Pentecost – Wer mich liebet , der wird mein Wort halten , BWV 59 , and Wer mich liebet , der wird mein Wort halten , BWV 74 . 
 = = Scoring and structure = = 
 In the Weimar version , Bach scored the cantata four vocal soloists ( soprano ( S ) , alto ( A ) , tenor ( T ) and bass ) ( B ) , a four @-@ part choir , and an orchestra of three trumpets ( Tr ) , timpani ( Ti ) , recorder ( Fl ) or flauto traverso ( Ft ) , oboe d 'amore ( Oa ) , two violins ( Vl ) , two violas ( Va ) , bassoon ( Fg ) , cello ( Vc ) , and basso continuo ( Bc ) . It is a festive , rich instrumentation for the holiday , whereas the previous two cantatas in Weimar had not employed brass instruments . Bach used the French string orchestra with two viola parts , as in most cantatas until 1715 , when he started to prefer the Italian scoring with one viola . In Weimar , a recorder or flauto traverso doubled the first violin an octave higher ; in the first Leipzig performance it was a flauto traverso . A part for obbligato organ ( Org ) replacing oboe and cello in movement 5 was adopted in an even later performance . The work is about 25 minutes long . In the Weimar version and the 1724 version , Bach requested a repeat of the opening chorus , by adding after the chorale Chorus <unk> ab initio . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Weimar version of the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe , and the abbreviations for voices and instruments the list of Bach cantatas . The keys are given for the Weimar version . The time signature is provided using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) .

 The cantata text does not tell a story but reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit , celebrated on Pentecost . It begins with general praise , then concentrates on one line from the Gospel , addresses the Holy Trinity , refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation , shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit , and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai 's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God ( Spirit ) and man , as shown in the dialogue . The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection . 
 John Eliot Gardiner , who conducted all Bach 's church cantatas in 2000 , placed the Pentecostal cantatas in the middle of the project , which he saw as a " year @-@ long exploration of his cantatas in their seasonal context " . He described Pentecost as " the culmination of those ' great fifty days ' which follow the Resurrection , a watershed marking the completion of Jesus ' work on earth and the coming of the Holy Spirit " , and commented that Bach " comes up with music of unalloyed optimism and exuberance in celebration of ... the miraculous ignition of the divine Pentecostal spark which allows human beings to communicate across the language barrier " . Regarding Erschallet , ihr Lieder , the first cantata written for the occasion , he observed that Bach reflects the " stages in the evolving relationship of God with man " , both by scoring and by his choice of keys . In the Weimar first version , the key of the first movements is C major , lowered to A minor ( a third lower ) in the fourth , lowered further to F major ( again a third lower ) in the fifth and sixth . The scoring is majestic , with three trumpets and timpani in movement 1 and three trumpets again in movement 3 , reduced to strings in movement 4 and to single instruments in movement 5 . 
 = = = 1 = = = 
 " Erschallet , ihr Lieder " ( literally : sound , you songs ) is a festive concerto , marked Coro by Bach . Words and music are possibly based on an earlier lost secular <unk> ( congratulatory cantata ) . A printing of Franck 's works contains a cantata for New Year 's Day , Erschallet nun <unk> , <unk> Lieder ( Sound again , congratulating songs ) that may have served as a model . The movement is in da capo form : the first section is repeated after a contrasting middle section . It is scored for three " choirs " : one of trumpets , another of strings and bassoon , and a four @-@ part chorus . The number three , symbolizing the Trinity , appears again in the 3 / 8 time signature and in the use of three trumpets . The first part opens with trumpet fanfares , alternating with flowing coloraturas in the strings . The voices enter as a third homophonic choir . They repeat the first measure of the fanfare motif on the word " Erschallet " ( resound ! ) , as the trumpets echo the motif . The voices repeat the motif from the second measure of the fanfare on " ihr Lieder " , and the trumpets echo it again . The chorus repeats measures 3 and 4 on " erklinget , ihr Saiten " , commanding the strings to play . As a culmination , the first syllable of " <unk> Zeiten " ( most blessed times ) is held on a seventh chord ( first in measure 53 ) , during which the instruments play their motifs . 
 In the middle section in A minor the trumpets rest while the other instruments play colla parte with the voices . Polyphonic imitation expands on the idea that God will prepare the souls to be his temples . The first sequence progresses from the lowest to the highest voice , with entrances after two or three measures . The highest voice begins the second sequence , and the other voices enter in closer succession , one or two measures apart . Gardiner interprets the polyphony as " conjuring before us the elegant tracery of those ' temples ' which God promises to make of our souls " . The first part is repeated as da capo . 
 The movement is comparable to the opening of <unk> , ihr <unk> ! Erschallet , <unk> ! BWV 214 ( Resound , ye drums ! Ring out , ye trumpets ! ) composed in 1733 on another text calling instruments to sound , which Bach later used with a different text to open his Christmas Oratorio . Bach used a festive scoring with three trumpets in triple meter in his 1733 Missa for the court in Dresden , in the Gloria , in contrast to the preceding Kyrie . 
 = = = 2 = = = 
 The cantata 's only recitative quotes one line from the Gospel reading of the day : " Wer mich liebet , der wird mein Wort halten " ( Whoever loves Me will keep My Word [ , and My Father will love him , and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him ] ) . Bach reflects Jesus ' promise to " make Our dwelling with him " in melismatic lines in counterpoint with motifs in the cello similar to motifs in movement 5 . He assigned the words of Jesus to the bass as the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) . He illustrates the final rest in God by ending the solo line on a whole note low C , the lowest note he demanded of a soloist . The musicologist Julian Mincham describes the vocal line : 
 The initial bars of melody are warm and quietly authoritative , but at the mention of dwelling with Him the movement takes on a very different character . The bass line becomes enlivened with little leaps of delight ... The singer 's last note is a bottom d ( c in the transposed version ) several notes lower than a bass 's accepted range . ... when achieved it is an arresting sound , confirming the rock @-@ like certainty of the promise that we shall eventually reside with God . 
 = = = 3 = = = 
 The first aria , addressing the Trinity , " <unk> <unk> " ( <unk> Trinity ) , is accompanied by a choir of three trumpets and basso continuo , a rare combination that expresses the idea of the words . The trumpet is a symbol of a ruler . The three trumpets sometimes play in unison , to further illustrate the Trinity . The theme is composed of the three notes of the major chord . The aria is in three sections . 
 Bach wrote an aria accompanied by only an obbligato brass instrument again in his Missa ( Kyrie and Gloria in B minor ) , composed in 1733 for the court in Dresden and much later integrated into his Mass in B minor . The bass aria Quoniam tu solus sanctus , reflecting God 's holiness and majesty , is set for corno da caccia , two bassoons and basso continuo . When he assembled the complete mass , he used an aria with only woodwinds to reflect the Holy Spirit in Et in Spiritum Sanctum , also a movement with many symbols of the Trinity . 
 = = = 4 = = = 
 The second aria , for tenor , " O <unk> " ( O paradise of the soul ) , also contains three sections and a triple meter , but in contrast to the previous movement , describes in continuous waves of the unison strings the Spirit that was present at the Creation , worded O <unk> , das Gottes Geist <unk> , der bei der <unk> <unk> ( O paradise of the soul , fanned by the Spirit of God , which blew at creation ) . Alfred Dürr wrote that the music " conveys the impression of release from all earthly gravity " . 
 = = = 5 = = = 
 The last solo movement , titled Aria , " Komm , laß mich nicht <unk> <unk> " ( Come , do not keep me waiting longer ) , consists of a dialogue between the Soul and the Holy Spirit , and takes a form close to a love lyric . The part of the Spirit is assigned to the alto , while similar duets of the Soul and Jesus in later cantatas are set for soprano and bass – for example in Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis , BWV 21 and Wachet auf , ruft uns die Stimme , BWV 140 . 
 Bach set the text in a complex structure uniting two singers , a solo oboe and a solo cello . The soprano and alto sing of their unity in " neo @-@ erotic " or " overtly erotic / <unk> " language : " I shall die , if I have to be without you " the one ; " I am yours , and you are mine ! " the other . The cello provides an intricate counterpoint throughout , which Albert Schweitzer describes as " a motif of purified happiness " . The voices and the cello form a trio , another symbol of the Trinity . The musicologist Anne Leahy of the Dublin Institute of Technology notes that Bach had possibly stanza 3 in mind , which speaks of love , and used the instrument which is named after love . 
 The oboe d 'amore plays the richly ornamented melody of the Pentecost hymn " Komm , Heiliger Geist , Herre Gott " ( " Come , Holy Spirit , Lord God , fill with the goodness of Your grace the hearts , wills , and minds of Your faithful . Ignite Your burning love in them " . ) Bach set this hymn , which seems close to his heart , twice in his Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes , as BWV 651 and BWV 652 . 
 Bach used duets again when he composed in 1733 his Missa ( Kyrie and Gloria in B minor ) for the court in Dresden , which he later integrated into his Mass in B minor . He wrote two duets movements in the style of contemporary operatic love duets and placed two of them in the centre of each part of the Missa : Christe eleison for two sopranos in the centre of the Kyrie , Domine Deus in the centre of the symmetrical structure of the Gloria . When he compiled the Mass in B minor , he chose another duet Et in unum Dominum Jesum Christum for the Credo , scored for soprano and alto , as in Erschallet , ihr Lieder . 
 = = = 6 = = = 
 The text of the concluding chorale is taken from Nicolai 's " <unk> <unk> " ( Spiritual bridal song ) " Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern " , continuing the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit . " Von Gott kömmt mir ein <unk> " ( A joyful radiance reaches me from God ) is illustrated by a violin part added to the four @-@ part choir . The text ends with the words : 
 Nimm mich <unk> 
 In dein ' <unk> , daß ich <unk> 
 <unk> ' von <unk> ! 
 Auf dein Wort komm ' ich <unk> . 
 ( Take me like a friend / in your arms , so that I may become warm / with your grace / To your word I come invited . ) 
 Until 1724 the opening chorus was repeated after the chorale , marked " chorus <unk> ab initio " in the manuscript . 
 Gardiner describes the cantata as " evidently ... a work which he particularly valued " , adding : " he comes up with music of unalloyed optimism and exuberance in celebration of the first gifts of newly @-@ awakened nature , as well as the miraculous ignition of the divine Pentecostal spark which allows human beings to communicate across the language barrier . " Dürr comments : 
 All the various changes he made show how much trouble Bach took over a work which – as the number of documented performances ( at least four ) suggests – he seems to have particularly loved .

 " Fotos y Recuerdos " ( English : Pictures and Memories ) is a song recorded by American recording artist Selena for her fourth studio album , Amor Prohibido ( 1994 ) . It was released by EMI Latin in January 1995 , as the fourth single . A cover version of the Pretenders ' 1983 single " Back on the Chain Gang " , " Fotos y Recuerdos " was written by Chrissie Hynde with Spanish @-@ language lyrics by Ricky Vela . Lyrically , the song describes a lonely female protagonist who " kisses the photo of her [ lover ] each night before falling asleep . " 
 " Fotos y Recuerdos " is a Rock en Español song with influences of dance pop and house music . The song garnered acclaim from music critics , who called it an improvement over the Pretenders ' original version . The song peaked at number one on the United States Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks , her fourth successive number one song . " Fotos y Recuerdos " also peaked at number one on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart , her second consecutive number one . " Fotos y Recuerdos " became Selena 's first posthumous number one song , following the shooting death of the singer in March 1995 .

 While flying back from New York , A.B. Quintanilla — the brother @-@ producer of Selena — heard the Pretenders ' 1983 single " Back on the Chain Gang " on the radio . At the time , A.B. was having a nervous breakdown after realizing he was running out of materials to record for Selena 's fourth studio album , Amor Prohibido ( 1994 ) . He likened the idea of reworking " Back on the Chain Gang " into a Spanish @-@ language cumbia song . Keyboardist of the group , Ricky Vela wrote the Spanish lyrics into a cumbia @-@ style that A.B. envisioned for the recording . The Amor Prohibido album was pressed for a release date of March 13 , 1994 , and was halted for distribution due to the copyrighting issues with " Fotos y Recuerdos " . Vela retold in a 2002 interview how he was awaken by Selena and A.B. because they did not have the clearance for " Fotos y Recuerdos " .

It was only after Vela re @-@ wrote the song into English that Hynde gave Selena the clearance for the recording . Musicologist James Perone , noticed how the song was the shortest track off of Amor Prohibido .

 " Rose " is the opening episode of the first series of the revived British science fiction television programme Doctor Who . The episode was directed by Keith Boak and written by Russell T Davies who was also one of the three executive producers . It was first broadcast in the UK on BBC One on 26 March 2005 . " Rose " was the first Doctor Who episode to air since the Doctor Who television film in 1996 . 
 The plot involves Rose Tyler meeting the Doctor , a time @-@ travelling alien Time Lord . She first encounters him in the department store where she works , while being attacked by Autons – living plastic in the guise of shop window mannequins . Rose and the Doctor uncover and defeat a plot by the alien Nestene Consciousness , which aimed to take over the Earth using the living plastic , after which she accepts the Doctor 's offer to travel through time and space with him in his time machine , the TARDIS . 
 The episode marked the debut of Christopher Eccleston , the ninth actor to play the Doctor since the programme started in 1963 , and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler , the Doctor 's companion . Being the first episode of the revived series , several lead characters were introduced ; Camille Coduri as Jackie Tyler , and Noel Clarke as Mickey Smith . Viewers did not see the Doctor character regenerate from a previous incarnation ; regeneration being a plot device in which the character of the Doctor changes body and identity . Russell T Davies felt it would be clearer for the viewer to begin the series with the new actor in place rather than show the previous actor regenerating . " Rose " began filming in Cardiff , the headquarters of BBC Wales , in July 2004 , with some location scenes shot in London . " Rose " was viewed by 10 @.@ 81 million viewers in the UK , the most viewed Doctor Who episode since The Creature from the Pit in 1979 ( making it the first episode in over 25 years ) ; and received positive reviews from critics , though there were some criticisms of its use of humour . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old shop assistant is being chased by mannequins in the basement of Henrik 's , the department store where she works . She is rescued by the Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) who destroys the building with an explosion . The next day , the Doctor visits Rose at her home where he is attacked by a plastic mannequin arm which he and Rose subdue . Rose investigates the Doctor and meets Clive ( Mark Benton ) , who has been tracking the Doctor 's appearances throughout history . Clive tells Rose the Doctor is dangerous , and that if he 's there , something bad is about to happen . While Rose is talking to Clive , her boyfriend Mickey Smith ( Noel Clarke ) is kidnapped by a wheelie bin and replaced with a plastic doppelgänger . 
 The fake Mickey takes Rose to lunch and attempts to question her about the Doctor , but the Doctor shows up and beheads the doppelgänger . The Doctor takes Rose and the plastic head to the TARDIS and attempts to use the head to locate the controlling signal . With the head connected , the TARDIS takes them to the London Eye . The Doctor explains to Rose that the fake Mickey was an Auton , controlled by a signal from the Nestene Consciousness . He has a vial of anti @-@ plastic that can be used to destroy the Nestene if necessary . Realising that the transmitter is the London Eye itself , Rose and the Doctor descend underneath it to stop the Nestene Consciousness . They find Mickey , tied up but alive , and the Doctor speaks to the Nestene Consciousness . He tries to negotiate with it , but the Consciousness blames the Doctor for the destruction of its planet during the Time War . The Consciousness activates all the Autons at a shopping arcade , where several shoppers are shot and killed , including Clive . The Doctor is also held down by a pair of Autons , but Rose rescues him and the anti @-@ plastic drops into the vat where the Nestene Consciousness resides , killing it . With the Consciousness dead , the Autons all collapse . The Doctor uses the TARDIS to take Mickey and Rose home , then persuades Rose to join him as his new companion .

 Both the Autons and the Nestene Consciousness first appeared in the serial Spearhead from Space ( 1970 ) , and then reappeared in Terror of the Autons . This story introduces The Shadow Proclamation , an intergalactic police force mentioned several times in the revived series and eventually seen in " The Stolen Earth " . This is the first mention of the Time War , which would be one of the running threads throughout the series .

 = = = Background and casting = = = 
 Doctor Who originally ran from 1963 to 1989 , when it was cancelled after its twenty @-@ sixth season . Television producer Russell T Davies had been lobbying the BBC in an attempt to revive the show from the late 1990s , and reached the discussion phase in 2002 . It was announced in September 2003 that Doctor Who was returning and would be produced by BBC Wales via a BBC press release . The format of the programme was changed to 45 @-@ minute episodes , lightening the pace . Davies was inspired by American series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Smallville , in particular by using Buffy 's structure of season @-@ long story arcs around a " Big Bad " villain . 
 It was announced in March 2004 that Christopher Eccleston would be playing the Doctor . Jane Tranter , BBC Controller of Drama Commissioning , stated that casting an actor of Eccleston 's reputation signaled " our intention to take Doctor Who into the 21st century , as well as retaining its core traditional values — to be surprising , edgy and eccentric . " Eccleston is the ninth actor to play the Doctor since the programme started in 1963 . New actors are able to take over the role through a plot device of regeneration , in which the character of the Doctor changes body and identity ; this having been introduced in 1966 . Russell T Davies decided to begin the revived series with a new Doctor rather than show the regeneration , as he believed it was " madness " to start with someone and then change him before the audience could build a relationship with him . Davies wanted to initially approach the revival as a " new programme " . Eccleston 's character is more " down @-@ to @-@ earth " than previous Doctors ; Davies referred to him as " stripped down " , while still having " fun and humour " . Eccleston 's costume of a battered leather jacket was in Davies ' original pitch , but the clothing also went with Eccleston 's desire not to have clothes dominating his time on the show . The Ninth Doctor 's clothes do not dominate him , but rather create a simple silhouette and an " action man " vibe . 
 Billie Piper 's casting as Rose Tyler was announced in May 2004 . According to executive producer Julie Gardner , former pop star Piper " fits the bill perfectly " as a " unique , dynamic partner for Christopher Eccleston " . Davies described Rose as " the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal . " Camille Coduri and Noel Clarke were also cast to play Rose 's mother and boyfriend respectively ; Davies wanted to include these characters to " make her real " and to " give her a life " . Rose 's family is also working @-@ class , which had rarely been seen in companions on the show prior to " Rose " . 
 = = = Writing and filming = = = 
 The episode name had gradually been shortened ; in Davies 's pitch it had been called Rose meets the Doctor , and the journey begins , on his contract as Rose Meets The Doctor , but finally shortened to Rose . Also changed from Davies 's original pitch were the names of the supporting characters : Judy Tyler became Jackie Tyler , and Muggsy Smith became Mickey Smith . Davies had trouble coming up with how Mickey was supposed to be captured by the Nestene while waiting for Rose in the car , and finally realised he could be lured by a plastic wheelie bin . He commented that such instances of the ordinary being made scary made Doctor Who unique . Davies had to take out " oblique " references to the Autons being like terrorists , as the Eye was once a target of a terrorist attack . The entrance of the Doctor was something much debated ; Tranter and other members of the production team wanted it to be more dramatic , but the scene was never reshot . Davies remarked that it reflects Rose 's point of view , whereas a more dramatic entrance would reflect the audience 's excitement at the Doctor coming back . The scene in which the Auton arm attacks in the Tyler 's flat was originally much longer , but was revised . The episode originally <unk> by several minutes , and a scene with the Doctor and Rose walking was added a month or so later . 
 Davies wanted the Doctor to realise that Rose has something to offer to his cause . Their holding hands while running was meant to signify that they were a team , despite him not asking her yet , and they were not to question their relationship . The episode was intended to be presented from Rose 's point @-@ of @-@ view . For audience identification purposes , Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human , so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans . Davies felt that there was no need to create a new monster , as the Autons met these criteria . The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors ; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed . Computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) was used in post @-@ production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes . Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space , although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead . 
 The episode was storyboarded by artist Anthony Williams . Davies offered Edgar Wright the opportunity to direct the episode , but Wright was forced to decline , as he was still working on Shaun of the Dead . Instead , the episode was directed by Keith Boak . " Rose " began filming in July 2004 , as part of the first production block alongside episodes four and five . The first five days were spent filming in London , while the rest was filmed in Cardiff . The production team was given permission to add more lights to the London Eye . For the scene in which the Doctor and Rose are running through London , careful timing was undertaken by the production team because they wanted a London bus to travel behind them , but this had to be accomplished by waiting for a bus to come . In other scenes filmed in Cardiff , a London bus and a van of the London Evening Standard drove by to give the illusion of London . The exterior of Rose 's council estate was filmed at a London estate as well as a Cardiff one in other scenes . Mickey 's flat is the same set as the Tyler 's , just redecorated . The production team sought to film the Cardiff scenes in secrecy , but the day before they began the Cardiff Council issued a press release naming the streets where they would be filming . The Autons ' attack during the climax was filmed on Working Street , Cardiff from 20 to 22 July 2004 @.@ with scenes set around major London landmarks like the London Eye being the exception . Henrik 's , where Rose works , is actually the department store Howells , and the pizza restaurant is La Fosse . It took the production team a while to find a restaurant that would require minimal set dressing but would be willing to close for a day . The street where Rose joins the Doctor is St David 's Market , while service tunnels in the basement of a hospital in Cardiff were used for the basement of Henrik 's where Rose is menaced by Autons . Studio filming mainly took place from August to October 2004 . 
 The area underneath the London Eye where the Doctor and Rose confront the Nestene Consciousness was filmed in an unused paper mill in Grangetown , Cardiff . It underwent steam cleaning because there were such high health and safety concerns . They were only permitted to film for three days , which required that some of the sequence be cut : originally , there was to be another Auton Mickey involved . Special effects producer Mike Tucker was reminded of the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun when reading the scene in which the Nestene 's lair is blown up , and sought to display it as a major effect . The production team built a one @-@ sixth scale model of the warehouse where the explosions were filmed . Tucker did a model explosion for the destruction of Henrik 's as well , although that was only for the roof ; the rest was done by CGI . The production team considered doing the explosion practically , but that would have been too expensive . In the original script , Rose 's first experience of seeing the TARDIS interior was shared with the audience . Director Keith Boak , however , wanted her to exit and run around the TARDIS before entering again , at which point the interior would be revealed to the audience . This change was eventually embraced by the executive producers . Davies remarked that he originally wanted to take Rose and the audience inside the TARDIS in all one shot , but this was not a feasible with the budget . This effect would later be accomplished in the 2012 Christmas special , " The Snowmen " .

 " Rose " was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2005 on BBC One , and was the first Doctor Who episode to air since the Doctor Who television film in 1996 . Unofficial overnight viewing figures from the Broadcasters ' Audience Research Board showed that the episode attracted an average of 9 @.@ 9 million viewers — 43 @.@ 2 % of the available television audience — over the course of the evening . At its peak , it had 10 @.@ 5 million viewers , a 44 @.@ 3 % share . The final figure for the episode , including video recordings watched within a week of transmission , was 10 @.@ 81 million , third for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels . In some regions , the first few minutes of the original BBC broadcast of this episode on 26 March were marred by the accidental mixing of a few seconds of sound from Graham Norton hosting Strictly Dance Fever . 
 Internationally , " Rose " was first transmitted on CBC in Canada on 5 April 2005 , debuting to strong ratings of 986 @,@ 000 viewers . In Australia , it was broadcast on 21 May 2005 on ABC to 1 @.@ 11 million viewers . " Rose " was first broadcast in the United States on the Sci @-@ Fi Channel on 17 March 2006 . It was aired back @-@ to @-@ back with the following episode " The End of the World " ; Davies had originally wanted to air the first two episodes together in the UK , but the request was given to the BBC too close to transmission . The US premiere was watched by 1 @.@ 58 million viewers . 
 On 30 March , four days after the episode was originally broadcast in the UK , the BBC announced that another full series had been commissioned . On the same day , the BBC released a statement , apparently from Eccleston , saying that he would be leaving the role at Christmas , for fear of being typecast . The BBC later revealed this was not an official statement from Eccleston , whom they had failed to contact before responding to press questions after the story broke ; the mis @-@ quote was re @-@ used in other media . Eccleston later said , " They handled it very badly , but they issued an apology and I dropped it " in an 2010 interview . David Tennant was called a " hot favourite " to replace Eccleston , when it was announced that Eccleston was leaving , BBC said that they were in talks with Tennant ; the bookmakers ' odds were at 1 / 10 , with William Hill refusing to take any bets on who would act a new Doctor . A BBC spokesman said that they had " hoped , rather than expected " that Eccleston would continue in the role .

 " Rose " received positive reviews and was seen as a successful relaunch to the programme . Harry Venning of The Stage praised Davies ' script , particularly for taking it seriously and making it scary . He was pleased with Piper 's acting and Rose , who proved to be more independent than her predecessors . However , he felt that Eccleston was " the show 's biggest disappointment " as he seemed unsuited to a fantasy role . Digital Spy 's Dek Hogan stated that production values had increased from the classic series , and praised the acting and characters of Eccleston , Piper , and Clarke . However , he felt that some of the humour — such as the wheelie bin burping after it consumes Mickey — was not as enjoyable as an adult . The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer Robin Oliver praised Davies for " [ taking ] an adult approach to one of television 's most famous characters " and " [ overriding ] the cash @-@ strapped production values of the past to make his new doctor competitive in a high @-@ tech market " . Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times described the revival as " superb " and " intelligent and well @-@ done " . Daily Mail writer Michael Hanlon said that " As a fan I really hope this new series succeeds . It 's lively , well filmed and the special effects are up to scratch . There is humour , a vital ingredient if the new series is to be a success . " He also felt that everything necessary for Doctor Who was present in " Rose " . However , Stephen Brook of The Guardian said that it was " pitched at its youngest ever audience " , and also felt that the episode had an " overdose on humour " . 
 Retrospective reviews have also been positive . Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave " Rose " four out of five stars in 2013 , particularly praising Rose 's fleshed @-@ out life and how it welcomed in new viewers . While he noted " minor gripes " and felt the Autons ' destruction was toned @-@ down , he praised the direction and the performances and called it " a blinding success " . The A.V. Club reviewer Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a grade of a B , also noting how important it was that Rose 's world was shown first . He felt that some effects already seemed dated in 2013 and Jackie and Mickey were one @-@ dimensional , but the episode succeeded above all else , especially in developing Rose and the Doctor 's relationship and pointing out that Doctor Who is dangerous . In 2013 , Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph named " Rose " as one of the top ten Doctor Who stories set in the contemporary time .

 = Chester Cathedral = 
 Chester Cathedral is a Church of England cathedral and the mother church of the Diocese of Chester . It is located in the city of Chester , Cheshire , England . The cathedral ( formerly the abbey church of a Benedictine monastery , dedicated to Saint Werburgh ) is dedicated to Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary . Since 1541 it has been the seat of the Bishop of Chester . 
 The cathedral is a Grade I listed building , and part of a heritage site that also includes the former monastic buildings to the north , which are also listed Grade I. The cathedral , typical of English cathedrals in having been modified many times , dates from between 1093 and the early 16th century , although the site itself may have been used for Christian worship since Roman times . All the major styles of English medieval architecture , from Norman to Perpendicular , are represented in the present building . 
 The cathedral and former monastic buildings were extensively restored during the 19th century ( amidst some controversy ) , and a free @-@ standing bell @-@ tower was added in the 20th century . The buildings are a major tourist attraction in Chester . In addition to holding services for Christian worship , the cathedral is used as a venue for concerts and exhibitions . 
 = = History = = 
 The city of Chester was an important Roman stronghold . There may have been a Christian basilica on the site of the present cathedral in the late Roman era , while Chester was controlled by Legio XX Valeria Victrix . Legend holds that the basilica was dedicated to St Paul and Saint Peter . This is supported by evidence that in Saxon times the dedication of an early chapel on this site was changed from Saint Peter to Saint Werburgh . 
 During the Dark Ages <unk> of Norbury , a Catholic Celtic saint and hermit , was venerated at Chester Cathedral with a feast day on 10 September . He is known to history mainly through the hagiography of the <unk> Manuscript ; he also occurs in a litany in the Tanner of the Bodleian Library , Oxford . 
 In the 10th century , St Werburgh 's remains were brought to Chester , and 907 AD her shrine was placed in the church . It is thought that <unk> turned the church into a college of secular canons , and that it was given a charter by King Edgar in 968 . The collegiate church , as it was then , was restored in 1057 by Leofric , Earl of Mercia and Lady Godiva . This church was razed to the ground around 1090 , with the secular canons evicted , and no known trace of it remains . 
 In 1093 a Benedictine abbey was established on the site by Hugh Lupus , Earl of Chester , with the assistance of St Anselm and other monks from Bec in Normandy . The earliest surviving parts of the structure date from that time . The abbey church was not at that time the cathedral of Chester ; from 1075 to 1082 the cathedral of the diocese was the nearby church of St John the Baptist , after which the see was transferred to Coventry . In 1538 , during the dissolution of the monasteries , the monastery was disbanded and the shrine of Saint Werburgh was desecrated . In 1541 St Werburgh 's abbey became a cathedral of the Church of England , by order of Henry VIII . At the same time , the dedication was changed to Christ and the Blessed Virgin . The last abbot of St Werburgh ’ s Abbey , Thomas Clarke , became the first dean of the new cathedral , at the head of a secular chapter . 
 Although little trace of the 10th @-@ century church has been discovered , save possibly some Saxon masonry found during a 1997 excavation of the nave , there is much evidence of the monastery of 1093 . This work in the Norman style may be seen in the northwest tower , the north transept and in remaining parts of the monastic buildings . The abbey church , beginning with the Lady Chapel at the eastern end , was extensively rebuilt in Gothic style during the 13th and 14th centuries . At the time of the dissolution of the monasteries , the cloister , the central tower , a new south transept , the large west window and a new entrance porch to the south had just been built in the Perpendicular style , and the southwest tower of the façade had been begun . The west front was given a Tudor entrance , but the tower was never completed . 
 In 1636 the space beneath the south west tower became a bishop 's consistory court . It was furnished as such at that time , and is now a unique survival in England , hearing its last case , that of an attempted suicide of a priest , in the 1930s . Until 1881 , the south transept , which is unusually large , also took on a separate function as an independent ecclesiastical entity : the parish church of St Oswald . Although the 17th century saw additions to the furnishings and fittings , there was no further building work for several centuries . By the 19th century , the building was badly in need of restoration . The present homogeneous appearance that the cathedral presents from many exterior angles is largely the work of Victorian restorers , particularly George Gilbert Scott . 
 The 20th century has seen continued maintenance and restoration . In 1922 , the Chester War Memorial was installed in the cathedral grounds and dedicated to the fallen soldiers of the First World War and later the Second World War . In 1973 – 75 a detached belfry , designed by George Pace , was erected in the grounds of the cathedral . In 2005 a new Song School was added to the cathedral . During the 2000s , the cathedral library was refurbished and relocated . It was officially reopened in September 2007 . The cathedral and the former monastic buildings were designated as Grade I listed buildings on 28 July 1955 . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 = = = Cathedral = = = 
 = = = = Plan = = = = 
 Chester Cathedral has an east @-@ west axis , common to many cathedrals , with the chancel at the eastern end , and the façade to the west . The plan is cruciform , with a central tower ( as is usual in English monastic churches ) , but is asymmetrical , having a small transept on the north side remaining from an earlier building , and an unusually large south transept . As the plan shows , the asymmetry extends to the west front , where the north tower remains from the Norman building , and the south tower is of the early 16th century . At the eastern end , the symmetrical arrangement of the aisles was lost when the end of the south aisle was demolished and rebuilt in an apsidal shape . The nave , choir and south transept have wide aisles on either side , and are lit by clerestory windows and large multi @-@ light windows in each of the three cliff @-@ like ends . To the north of the cathedral are monastic buildings , including the cloister , refectory and a rectangular chapter house . The façade of the building is abutted on the north by later buildings . 
 = = = = External appearance = = = = 
 <unk> the cathedrals of Carlisle , Lichfield and Worcester , Chester Cathedral is built of New Red Sandstone , in this case Keuper Sandstone from the Cheshire Basin . The stone lends itself to detailed carving , but is also friable , easily eroded by rain and wind , and is badly affected by pollution . With the other red sandstone buildings , Chester is one of the most heavily restored of England 's cathedrals . The restoration , which included much refacing and many new details , took place mainly in the 19th century . 
 Because the south transept is similar in dimension to the nave and choir , views of the building from the south @-@ east and south @-@ west give the impression of a building balanced around a central axis , with its tower as the hub . The tower is of the late 15th century Perpendicular style , but its four large battlemented turrets are the work of the restoration architect George Gilbert Scott . With its rhythmic arrangement of large , traceried windows , pinnacles , battlements and buttresses , the exterior of Chester Cathedral from the south presents a fairly homogeneous character , which is an unusual feature as England 's cathedrals are in general noted for their stylistic diversity . Close examination reveals window tracery of several building stages from the 13th to the early 16th century . The richness of the 13th @-@ century tracery is accentuated by the presence of ornate , <unk> drip @-@ mouldings around the windows ; those around the perpendicular windows are of simpler form . 
 The façade of the cathedral is dominated by a large deeply recessed eight @-@ light window in the Perpendicular style , above a recessed doorway set in a screen @-@ like porch designed , probably by Seth and George Derwall , in the early 1500s . This porch formed part of the same late 15th @-@ century building programme as the south transept , central and southwest towers , and cloister . Neither of the west towers was completed . To the north is the lower stage of a Norman tower , while to the south is the lower stage of a tower designed and begun , probably by Seth and George Derwall , in 1508 , but left incomplete following the dissolution of the monastery in 1538 . The cathedral 's façade is abutted on the north by a Victorian building housing the education centre and largely obscured from view by the building previously used as the King 's School , which is now a branch of Barclays Bank . The door of the west front is not used as the normal entrance to the cathedral , which is through the southwest porch which is in an ornate Tudor style . 
 = = = = Interior = = = = 
 The interior of Chester Cathedral gives a warm and mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone . The proportions appear spacious because the view from the west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave , although not long , is both wide and high compared with many of England 's cathedrals . The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced , those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery . The proportions are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault , like that at York Minster , is of wood , not stone . 
 = = = = Norman remnants = = = = 
 The present building , dating from around 1283 to 1537 , mostly replaced the earlier monastic church founded in 1093 which was built in the Norman style . It is believed that the newer church was built around the older one . That the few remaining parts of the Norman church are of small proportions , while the height and width of the Gothic church are generous would seem to confirm this belief . Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept , which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to the sacristy , which was formerly a chapel . The transept has retained an early 16th @-@ century coffered ceiling with decorated bosses , two of which are carved with the arms of Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey . 
 The north west tower is also of Norman construction . It serves as the baptistry and houses a black marble font , consisting of a bowl on a large baluster dating from 1697 . The lower part of the north wall of the nave is also from the Norman building , but can only be viewed from the cloister because the interior has been decorated with mosaic . 
 = = = = Early English = = = = 
 The Early English Gothic chapter house , built between 1230 and 1265 , is rectangular and opens off a " charming " vestibule leading from the north transept . The chapter house has grouped windows of simple untraceried form . Alec Clifton @-@ Taylor describes the exterior of this building as a " modest but rather elegant example of composition in lancets " while Nikolaus Pevsner says of the interior " It is a wonderfully noble room " which is the " aesthetic climax of the cathedral " . To the north of the chapter house is the <unk> , also Early English in style , and the warming room , which contains two large former fireplaces . The monastic refectory to the north of the cloister is of about the same date as the chapter house . 
 The Lady Chapel to the eastern end of the choir dates from between 1265 and 1290 . It is of three bays , and contains the Shrine of St Werburgh , dating from the 14th century . The vault of the Lady Chapel is the only one in the cathedral that is of stone . It is decorated with carved roof bosses representing the Trinity , the Madonna and Child , and the murder of Thomas Becket . The chapel also has a sedilia and a piscina . 
 = = = = Decorated Gothic = = = = 
 The choir , of five bays , was built between 1283 and 1315 to the design of Richard <unk> , and is an early example of Decorated Gothic architecture . The piers have strongly modelled attached shafts , supporting deeply moulded arches . There is a triforium gallery with four cusped arches to each bay . The <unk> vault , which is a 19th @-@ century restoration , is supported by clusters of three shafts which spring from energetic figurative corbels . The overall effect is robust , and contrasts with the delicacy of the pinnacled choir stalls , the tracery of the windows and the rich decoration of the vault which was carried out by the ecclesiastical designers , Clayton and Bell . The choir stalls , dating from about 1380 , are one of the glories of the cathedral . 
 The aisles of the choir previously both extended on either side of the Lady Chapel . The south aisle was shortened in about 1870 by George Gilbert Scott , and given an apsidal east end , becoming the chapel of St Erasmus . The eastern end of the north aisle contains the chapel of St Werburgh . 
 The nave of six bays , and the large , aisled south transept were begun in about 1323 , probably to the design of Nicholas de <unk> . There are a number of windows containing fine Flowing Decorated tracery of this period . The work ceased in 1375 , in which year there was a severe outbreak of plague in England . The building of the nave was recommenced in 1485 , more than 150 years after it was begun . The architect was probably William <unk> . Remarkably , for an English medieval architect , he maintained the original form , changing only the details . The nave was roofed with a stellar vault rather like that of the Lady Chapel at Ely and the choir at York Minster , both of which date from the 1370s . Like that at York , the vault is of wood , imitating stone . 
 = = = = Perpendicular Gothic = = = = 
 From about 1493 until 1525 the architect appears to have been Seth Derwall , succeeded by George Derwall until 1537 . Seth Derwall completed the south transept to a Perpendicular Gothic design , as seen in the transomed windows of the clerestory . He also built the central tower , southwest porch and cloisters . Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508 , but it had not risen above the roofline at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries , and has never been completed . The central tower , rising to 127 feet ( 39 m ) , is a “ lantern tower ” with large windows letting light into the crossing . Its external appearance has been altered by the addition of four battlemented turrets by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century . 
 = = = Former monastic buildings = = = 
 The Perpendicular Gothic cloister is entered from the cathedral through a Norman doorway in the north aisle . The cloister is part of the building programme that commenced in the 1490s and is probably the work of Seth Derwall . The south wall of the cloister , dating from the later part of the Norman period , forms the north wall of the nave of the cathedral , and includes blind arcading . Among the earliest remaining structures on the site is an undercroft off the west range of the cloisters , which dates from the early 12th century , and which was originally used by the monks for storing food . It consists of two naves with groin vaults and short round piers with round scalloped capitals . 
 Leading from the south of the undercroft is the abbot 's passage which dates from around 1150 and consists of two bays with rib @-@ vaulting . Above the abbot 's passage , approached by a stairway from the west cloister , is St Anselm 's Chapel which also dates from the 12th century . It is in three bays and has a 19th century Gothic @-@ style plaster vault . The chancel is in one bay and was remodelled in the early 17th century . The screen , altar rails , holy table and plaster ceiling of the chancel date from the 17th century . The north range of the cloister gives access to a refectory , built by Simon de Whitchurch in the 13th century . It contains an Early English pulpit , approached by a staircase with an ascending arcade . The only other similar pulpit in England is in Beaulieu Abbey .

 By the 19th century the fabric of the building had become badly weathered , with Charles Hiatt writing that " the surface rot of the very perishable red sandstone , of which the cathedral was built , was positively unsightly " and that the " whole place previous to restoration struck one as <unk> and neglected ; it perpetually seemed to hover on the verge of collapse , and yet was without a trace of the romance of the average ruin " . Between 1818 and 1820 the architect Thomas Harrison restored the south transept , adding corner turrets . This part of the building served until 1881 as the parish church of St Oswald , and it was ecclesiastically separate . From 1844 R. C. Hussey carried out a limited restoration including work on the south side of the nave . 
 The most extensive restoration was carried out by the Gothic Revival architect , George Gilbert Scott , who between 1868 and 1876 " almost entirely re @-@ cased " the cathedral . The current building is acknowledged to be mainly the product of this Victorian restoration commissioned by the Dean , John Saul Howson . In addition to extensive additions and alterations to the body of the church , Scott remodelled the tower , adding turrets and crenellations . Scott chose sandstone from the quarries at Runcorn for his restoration work . In addition to the restoration of the fabric of the building , Scott designed internal fittings such as the choir screen to replace those destroyed during the Civil War . He built the fan vault of the south porch , renewed the wooden vault of the choir and added a great many decorative features to the interior . 
 Scott 's restorations were not without their critics and caused much debate in architectural circles . Scott claimed to have archaeological evidence for his work , but the Liverpool architect , Samuel Huggins argued in an 1868 address to the Liverpool Architectural Society , that the alterations were less like restoration and more like rebuilding . One of the larger changes was to shorten the south aisle and restyle it as an apse . The changes also proposed the addition of a spire above the existing tower , but this proposal was later rejected . Samuel 's further paper of 1871 entitled On so @-@ called restorations of our cathedral and abbey churches compelled the Dean to attempt to answer the criticism . The debate contributed to the establishment of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . 
 Later in the century , from 1882 , Arthur Blomfield and his son Charles made further additions and modifications , including restoring and reinstating the Shrine of St Werburgh . More work was carried out in the 20th century by Giles Gilbert Scott between 1891 and 1913 , and by F. H. Crossley in 1939 . 
 = = = Bell tower = = = 
 Towards the end of 1963 the cathedral bells , which were housed in the central tower , were in need of an overhaul and ringing was suspended . In 1965 the Dean asked George Pace , architect to York Minster , to prepare specifications for a new bell frame and for electrification of the clock and tolling mechanism . Due to structural difficulties and the cost of replacing the bells in the central tower it was advised that consideration should be given to building a detached bell and clock tower in the southeast corner of the churchyard . It was decided to proceed with that plan , and in 1969 an announcement was made that the first detached cathedral bell tower was to be erected since the building of the campanile at Chichester Cathedral in the 15th century . In February 1969 , nine of the ten bells in the central tower were removed to be recast by John Taylor & Co as a ring of twelve bells with a flat sixth . The new bells were cast in 1973 . Work on the new bell @-@ tower began in February 1973 . Two old bells dating from 1606 and 1626 were left in the tower . On 26 February 1975 the bells were rung for the first time to celebrate the wedding of a member of the Grosvenor family . The official opening on 25 June 1975 was performed by the Duke of Gloucester . The belfry is known as the Dean <unk> Tower , after the dean of the cathedral responsible for its construction . The tower is built in concrete , faced with sandstone at its base . It is the first detached bell tower to be built for a cathedral in this country since the Reformation . Between the bell tower and the south transept is a garden in remembrance of the Cheshire Regiment ( originally the 22nd Regiment of Foot ) .

It was later moved to its present position at the front of the north transept . In 1910 William Hill and Son of London extensively rebuilt and <unk> the organ , replacing the Cavaillé @-@ Coll reeds with new pipes of their own . The choir division of the organ was enlarged and moved behind the choirstalls on the south side . The instrument was again overhauled by Rushworth and <unk> of Liverpool in 1969 , when a new mechanism and some new pipework made to a design by the organist , Roger Fisher , was installed . Since 1991 the organ has been in the care of David Wells of Liverpool .

 " Screams of Silence : The Story of Brenda Q " is the third episode of the tenth season of the animated comedy series Family Guy . It originally aired on October 30 , 2011 in the United States on Fox . The episode follows Griffin family neighbor Glenn Quagmire 's sister , Brenda , as she struggles with physical and mental abuse at the hands of her boyfriend , and eventual fiancé , Jeff . Quagmire , along with his neighbors , Peter and Joe , seek to relieve Brenda from her anguish , and soon decide to murder him , in order to prevent her from being harmed any further . 
 The episode was written by Alec Sulkin and directed by Dominic Bianchi . This episode generated significant controversy from various media organizations and critics for its portrayal of domestic violence , which , unusually for Family Guy , is portrayed in a serious manner , and received mixed critical reviews . An estimated 5 @.@ 97 million homes viewed the episode in its original airing according to Nielsen ratings . The episode featured a guest performance by Kaitlin Olson along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Peter decides to go fishing with Quagmire and Joe , but when Quagmire fails to show up , they decide to try to find him at his house . After entering his home , they discover that he has hanged himself in a fit of autoerotic asphyxiation . Attempting to save his life , they take him to the hospital , where they discover that he is in a coma . Peter invites Quagmire 's sister , Brenda , to visit him at the hospital , and she manages to wake up her brother . Brenda also brings along Jeff <unk> , her loud , thuggish and abusive boyfriend , who terrorizes her throughout the night to the dismay of Quagmire and his neighbors . 
 After a horrible night , Quagmire approaches Lois about talking to Brenda about leaving Jeff . At lunch , Lois and Brenda begin talking about the situation , and requests that Brenda remove her sunglasses , revealing a bruise over her eye . Upon seeing this , Lois tries to convince Brenda to leave Jeff , but Brenda only tries to justify Jeff 's treatment of her , much to Lois ' disgust . Later , at the bar , Peter , Quagmire and Joe discuss the matter , asking if the police can solve the situation . Joe then suggests that the group have an intervention with Brenda , where Quagmire confesses that the sister he knew growing up no longer exists , and he wants her back . The two then embrace each other by hugging , until Jeff enters the intervention , causing Quagmire to tell him that Brenda has agreed to leave him . Frightened by Jeff , Brenda reveals that the two are engaged , and that she is pregnant . 
 Later that evening , Peter , Quagmire and Joe begin discussing possibly killing Jeff , with Joe ( as a police officer ) , against the idea saying that it doesn 't matter , while Quagmire says that it does and explains that people like Jeff never change . Joe explains to Quagmire that he could get sent to jail if he killed Jeff and is still against the idea but when the trio see Jeff beat Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire 's TV , he renounces his reluctance and agrees to murder him . The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip in an attempt to kill him , and make it look like an accident . Having expected it , however , Jeff reveals his own gun , and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in another part of the woods . Once there , Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead , during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death . Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire 's body in , until he sees Quagmire , alive and well , behind the wheel of Peter 's car . Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over , smashing his head into a tree with Peter 's car . Peter , Joe and Quagmire return home the next day , and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her . As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff , Peter notes that he wishes he could kill someone else and gets an idea about Mort before the episode ends .

 = = = Critical reception and controversy = = = 
 This episode received negative reviews . Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote of the episode , " A serious episode of Family Guy cripples the show ’ s strengths . " McFarland also wrote , " while other shows , even the procedurals with grisly murders , are playing around in Halloween specials , Family Guy went for an episode about domestic abuse that wrote off any chance that comedy could save it if things took a wrong turn . " He went on to criticize it for its tone , noting " An episode like this only works if the bits of comedy surrounding the serious plot create contrast to the darker main story , but they weren 't here . " 
 McFarland praised Kaitlin Olson 's portrayal of Brenda , however , stating " Olson got some laughs out of just how deep Brenda ’ s denial went , finding every possible excuse to blame herself and exonerate Jeff . It made her endearing and easily likeable , every bit the opposite from Olson 's place in the rogue ’ s gallery of misanthropy on It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia . " He ended his review by comparing it to the fellow Fox animation series The Simpsons , noting , " The Simpsons managed to find the right blend with Sideshow Bob episodes , or in the aching sadness of Homer and Marge 's marriage , but as has been said ad infinitum , Family Guy hasn 't mastered that combination in the same way as the original . " He graded the episode as C + . 
 Terron R. Moore of Ology gave the episode a slightly more positive review , writing , " " The Story Of Brenda Q " , judging by only the title , could have been a Lifetime movie in the Seth MacFarlane fashion or anything else than a typical episode of the show , but it was pretty much a typical episode of the show . " He continued , " it 's pretty much an episode where someone on the Family Guy writing staff needed a new way to get out a bunch of pent @-@ up misogyny and anger . " He gave the episode a grade of seven out of ten . 
 Reaction to the episode by news media organizations was extremely negative and caused controversy , criticizing the episode for its portrayal of domestic violence . A. J. Hammer of Showbiz Tonight said of the episode , " Like so many other people , I was just shocked by what I saw on Family Guy last night , " and continued , " It was really just a depressing half hour of television . " In the same interview , Hammer asked television host Wendy Walsh of The Doctors about the storyline , to which she responded , " The main theme of the show was about this poor ' stupid ' woman who was too dumb to leave her relationship . And domestic violence is far more complicated than that . We 're watching someone rationalize a domestic violence relationship and this is the kind of thought process that actually goes on in real life . It ’ s not satire anymore . " 
 Nando Di Fino of Mediaite also complained that the episode may have gone too far , and compared it to previous episodes in the series that had been banned from airing on television , noting , " The show has dipped into sensitive material before , and Fox has actually refused to air two episodes — one dealing with abortion , the other with heavy Jewish themes . Sunday night 's episode , if reaction to it can be used as a good measure , may have been better joining those two episodes in exile . " Whitney Jefferson of Jezebel , a website centered on women 's issues , also strongly criticized the episode for its storyline involving Brenda and her boyfriend , Jeff : " Personally , I 'm way beyond being offended by the show — I 've long been numbed to shock @-@ value offensiveness — and had stopped watching years ago anyhow . But being a sucker for a Halloween @-@ themed episodes , I tuned in to Fox 's " Animation Domination " comedy block last night . What I saw was seriously awful . " Jefferson ended her review of the episode by stating that the show was " Definitely the scariest Halloween special we 've ever seen . " 
 = Richard Swinefield = 
 Richard Swinefield ( or Richard de Swinfield ; died 15 March 1317 ) was a medieval Bishop of Hereford , England . He earned a doctor of divinity degree as well as holding a number of ecclesiastical offices , including Archdeacon of London , before being named bishop . While bishop , he worked to secure the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe , his predecessor , whom he had worked for previously . Although he was active in his diocese , he spent little time in politics . He died in 1317 , and was buried in Hereford Cathedral where a memorial to his memory still stands . 
 = = Rise in the Church = = 
 Swinefield 's last name may come from Swingfield located near Folkestone , Kent . His father was Stephen of Swinfield , who died in 1282 , and his brother Stephen remained a layman . Other information about his family and upbringing is unknown , nor is his day or year of birth . He earned a doctor of divinity degree , but the location of his university studies is unknown . 
 By 1264 Swinefield was a member of the household of Thomas de Cantilupe , who went on to become Bishop of Hereford in 1275 . Swinefield held the prebend of Hampton in the diocese of Hereford , before 1279 and held that prebend until his election as bishop . Shortly after 17 April 1280 he was named Archdeacon of London , having previously held an unknown prebend in the diocese of London . 
 = = Episcopate = = 
 Swinefield was elected to the see of Hereford , or bishopric , on 1 October 1282 . The election was confirmed by John Peckham , the Archbishop of Canterbury on 31 December 1282 , and Swinefield was given custody of the spiritualities and temporalities , or the ecclesiastical and lay income producing properties , of the see by 8 January 1293 . He was consecrated on 7 March 1283 . 
 During Swinefield 's time as bishop , he was not involved in politics , and spent most of his time in his diocese . He rarely attended Parliament , usually excusing himself on the grounds of urgent diocesan business or his own bad health . He inherited a number of lawsuits from his predecessor , which he managed to settle . Swinefield also resolved a dispute over the boundary between the diocese of Hereford and the diocese of St Asaph , a Welsh bishopric , with the settlement being not entirely to the Welsh bishop 's liking . The town of Hereford also had disagreements with Swinefield , and on one occasion the bishop threatened excommunication against the town unless they submitted . 
 Swinefield was concerned to ensure that his clergy were well treated . He worked to ensure that churches within his diocese were not misappropriated through the granting of custody to unworthy candidates , as well as trying to keep order in the monasteries . His main efforts though went toward securing the canonisation of his predecessor Thomas de Cantilupe . This did not however take place until 1320 , after Swinefield 's death . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Swinefield died on 15 March 1317 , and was buried in Hereford Cathedral , where a memorial in the transept 's north wall shows Swinefield dressed as a bishop and holding a building . Two of his nephews were given offices within the diocese , with John given the precentorship in Hereford Cathedral , and Gilbert made the chancellor there . Another possible relative was Richard Swinfield , who also held a prebend in the diocese . 
 A record of Swinefield 's expenses as bishop has survived for the years 1289 and 1290 . The accounts offer a rare glimpse of the organisation and expenses of a major household in the time period . During the 296 days covered by the record , his household moved 81 times , with 38 of these stops associated with him visiting his diocese during April through June . The record also shows that he supported two scholars at Oxford University . The record has been printed a number of times , including by the Camden Society in 1853 though 1855 . 
 = Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor ( 806 ) = 
 The Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor in 806 was the largest operation ever launched by the Abbasid Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire . The expedition was commanded in person by the Abbasid Caliph Harun al @-@ Rashid ( reigned 786 – 809 ) , who wished to retaliate for the Byzantine successes in the Caliphate 's frontier region in the previous year and impress Abbasid might upon the Byzantine emperor , Nikephoros I ( r . 802 – 811 ) . The huge Abbasid army , according to Arab sources numbering more than 135 @,@ 000 men , raided across Cappadocia unopposed , capturing several towns and fortresses , most notably Herakleia , and forcing Nikephoros to seek peace in exchange for tribute . Following Harun 's departure , however , Nikephoros violated the terms of the treaty and reoccupied the frontier forts he had been forced to abandon . Harun 's preoccupation with a rebellion in Khurasan , and his death three years later , prohibited a reprisal on a similar scale . Moreover , the Abbasid civil war that began after 809 and the Byzantine preoccupation with the Bulgars contributed to a cessation of large @-@ scale Arab – Byzantine conflict for two decades . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the deposition of Byzantine empress Irene of Athens in October 802 and the accession of Nikephoros I in her place , a more violent phase in the long history of the Arab – Byzantine Wars began . Following a series of destructive annual raids across Asia Minor by the Abbasid Caliphate , Irene seems to have secured a truce with the Caliph Harun al @-@ Rashid in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of tribute , repeating the terms agreed for a three @-@ year truce after Harun 's first large @-@ scale campaign in 782 . Nikephoros , on the other hand , was more warlike — a Syriac source records that when he learned of Nikephoros 's accession , a Byzantine renegade warned the Arab governor of Upper Mesopotamia to " throw away his silk and put on his armour " . In addition , he was determined to refill the imperial treasury by , among other measures , ceasing the tribute . Harun retaliated at once , launching a raid under his son al @-@ Qasim in spring 803 . Nikephoros could not respond to this , as he faced a large @-@ scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander @-@ in @-@ chief , Bardanes Tourkos . After disposing of Bardanes , Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out to meet a second , larger invasion under the Caliph himself . After Harun raided the frontier region , the two armies confronted one another for two months in central Asia Minor , but it did not come to a battle ; Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters , until the Emperor arranged for a withdrawal and a truce for the remainder of the year in exchange for a one @-@ off payment of tribute . 
 In the next year , 804 , an Abbasid force under Ibrahim ibn Jibril crossed the Taurus Mountains into Asia Minor . Nikephoros set out to confront the Arabs , but was surprised and heavily defeated at the Battle of Krasos , where he barely escaped with his own life . Preoccupied with trouble in Khurasan , Harun once more accepted tribute and made peace . An exchange of prisoners was also arranged and took place during the winter at the border of the two empires on the Lamos river in Cilicia : some 3 @,@ 700 Muslims were exchanged for the Byzantines taken captive in the previous years . Harun then departed for Khurasan , leaving al @-@ Qasim to watch over the Byzantine frontier . Nikephoros used the opportunity in the spring to rebuild the destroyed walls of the towns of Safsaf , Thebasa , and Ancyra , and that summer , he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts ( thughur ) in Cilicia . The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of Mopsuestia and Anazarbus and took prisoners as it went . The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils , but the Byzantines marched on to Tarsus , which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun 's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia . The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive . At the same time , another Byzantine force raided the Upper Mesopotamian thughur and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of Melitene , while a Byzantine @-@ instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in Cyprus . 
 This sudden resumption of Byzantine offensive activity greatly alarmed Harun . In addition , he received reports that Nikephoros was planning similar attacks for the next year , which this time would aim at the full reoccupation of these frontier territories . As the historian Warren Treadgold writes , if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour , " garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland , to the Byzantines ' great benefit " . On the other hand , Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources , and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy 's resolve . 
 = = The campaign = = 
 Having settled matters in Khurasan , Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806 , drawing men from Syria , Palestine , Persia , and Egypt . According to al @-@ Tabari , his army numbered 135 @,@ 000 regular troops and additional volunteers and freebooters . These numbers — and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor of 300 @,@ 000 men — are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era and far more than the estimated strength of the entire Byzantine army . Although they are certainly exaggerated , they are nevertheless indicative of the size of the Abbasid force . At the same time , a naval force under his admiral Humayd ibn Ma <unk> al @-@ <unk> was prepared to raid Cyprus . 
 The huge invasion army departed Harun 's residence of Raqqa in northern Syria on 11 June 806 , with the Caliph at its head , allegedly wearing a cap with the inscription " Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim " ( in Arabic , " <unk> , hajj " ) . The Abbasids crossed Cilicia , where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt , and entered Byzantine Cappadocia through the Cilician Gates . Harun marched to Tyana , which at the time seems to have been abandoned . There , he began to establish his base of operations , ordering ' <unk> ibn Ja 'far al @-@ Khuza 'i to refortify the town and erect a mosque . Harun 's lieutenant Abdallah ibn Malik al @-@ Khuza 'i took <unk> , from where Harun 's cousin Dawud ibn ' Isa ibn Musa with half the Abbasid army , some 70 @,@ 000 men according to al @-@ Tabari , was sent to devastate Cappadocia . Another of Harun 's generals , <unk> ibn Ma 'n ibn Za <unk> captured the so @-@ called " Fortress of the Slavs " ( Hisn al @-@ <unk> ) and the recently rebuilt town of Thebasa , while Yazid ibn Makhlad captured the " Fort of the Willow " ( al @-@ Safsaf ) and <unk> . <unk> was captured and <unk> was placed under siege , while raiders reached as far as Ancyra , which they did not capture . Harun himself with the other half of his forces went west and captured Herakleia after a month @-@ long siege in August or September . The city was plundered and razed , and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate . At the same time , on Cyprus , Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16 @,@ 000 Cypriots , including the archbishop , captive to Syria , where they were sold as slaves . 
 Nikephoros , outnumbered and threatened by the Bulgars in his rear , could not resist the Abbasid onslaught . He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments , but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces . In the end , with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana , he sent three clerics as ambassadors : Michael , the bishop of Synnada , Peter the abbot of the monastery of <unk> , and Gregory , the steward of the metropolis of <unk> . Harun agreed to terms , which included an annual tribute ( 30 @,@ 000 gold nomismata , according to Theophanes , 50 @,@ 000 according to al @-@ Tabari ) , but in addition , the Emperor and his son and heir , Staurakios , were to pay a humiliating personal poll @-@ tax ( jizya ) of three gold coins each to the Caliph ( four and two respectively , in Tabari 's version ) , thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph 's subjects . In addition , Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts . Rashid then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The agreement of peace terms was followed by a surprisingly friendly exchange between the two rulers , related by al @-@ Tabari : Nikephoros asked Harun to send him a girl from Herakleia , one of the candidate brides for his son Staurakios , and for some perfume . According to Tabari , Harun " ordered the slave girl to be sought out ; she was brought back , adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging . The slave girl and the tent , together with its contents , vessels and fittings , were handed over to Nikephoros 's envoy . He also sent to Nikephoros the perfume which he had requested , and he further sent to him dates , dishes of jellied sweets , raisins and healing drugs . " Nikephoros returned the favour by dispatching a horse laden with 50 @,@ 000 silver coins , 100 satin garments , 200 garments of fine brocade , 12 falcons , four hunting dogs , and three more horses . But as soon as the Arabs had withdrawn , the Emperor again restored the frontier forts and thereafter ceased the payment of tribute . Theophanes records that Harun unexpectedly returned and seized Thebasa in retaliation , but this is not corroborated elsewhere . 
 The Arabs did launch a series of retaliatory raids in the next year , but the spring raid under Yazid ibn Makhlad al @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> was heavily defeated , with Yazid himself falling in the field . The larger summer raid under Harthama ibn A 'yan was met by Nikephoros in person , and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated . The Byzantines raided the region of Marash in return , while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid , which pillaged Rhodes and reached as far as the Peloponnese , where it fomented a rebellion among the local Slavs . On his return , however , Humayd lost several ships to a storm , and on the Peloponnese , the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture Patras . The failure of the year 's Abbasid efforts was compounded by another revolt in Khurasan , which forced Harun to depart again for the East . The Caliph concluded a new truce , and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808 . Nikephoros was thus left with his gains , both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute , intact . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Harun 's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms . Despite the sack of Herakleia , which is given prominent treatment in Arab sources , no permanent result was achieved , as Nikephoros was quick to violate the terms of the truce . If Harun had taken the advice offered by some of his lieutenants and proceeded further west to sack major cities , he could have inflicted long @-@ lasting damage on Byzantium . As it was , the Caliph was content with a show of force that would intimidate Nikephoros and prevent him from repeating the offensive of 805 . In this regard , the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success : after 806 , the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms , the recovery of the Balkans , and his wars there against the Bulgars . Nikephoros 's efforts would end tragically in the disastrous Battle of Pliska in 811 , but following Harun 's death on 24 March 809 , the Caliphate was riven by a civil war between his sons al @-@ Amin ( r . 809 – 813 ) and al @-@ Ma 'mun ( r . 813 – 833 ) , and was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals . Indeed , the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major , centrally organized , Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years . Only after the accession of Theophilos ( r . 829 – 842 ) and his confrontations with al @-@ Ma 'mun and al @-@ Mu 'tasim ( r . 833 – 842 ) would large @-@ scale cross @-@ border operations between the two empires resume . 
 The longest @-@ lasting impact of Harun 's campaign is found in literature . Among the Arabs , several legends , related by al @-@ Masudi , were associated with it . The Ottoman Turks also placed great importance on Harun 's battles with the Byzantines . Influenced by the events of Harun 's 782 campaign , Evliya Çelebi has the Caliph besieging Constantinople twice : the first time Harun withdrew , after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there ( an imitation of the tale of Queen Dido ) and in the second Harun had Nikephoros hanged from the Hagia Sophia . To commemorate his successful campaign , Harun also built a victory monument about 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) west of Raqqa , his principal residence . Known as <unk> in local tradition , apparently after Herakleia , it comprises a square structure with sides 100 metres ( 330 ft ) long , surrounded by a circular wall of some 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) in diameter , pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions . The main structure , built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun 's orders in 806 – 807 , has four vaulted halls on the ground floor , and ramps leading to an upper storey , which was left incomplete due to Harun 's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death . 
 = The Little Shop of Horrors = 
 The Little Shop of Horrors is a 1960 American black comedy horror film directed by Roger Corman . Written by Charles B. Griffith , the film is a farce about an inadequate florist 's assistant who cultivates a plant that feeds on human flesh and blood . The film 's concept is thought to be based on a 1932 story called " Green Thoughts " , by John Collier , about a man @-@ eating plant . However , Dennis McDougal in Jack Nicholson 's biography suggests that Charles B. Griffith may have been influenced by Arthur C. Clarke 's sci @-@ fi short story ' The Reluctant Orchid ' . The film stars Jonathan Haze , Jackie Joseph , Mel Welles and Dick Miller , all of whom had worked for Corman on previous films . Produced under the title The Passionate People Eater , the film employs an original style of humor , combining black comedy with farce and incorporating Jewish humor and elements of spoof . The Little Shop of Horrors was shot on a budget of $ 30 @,@ 000 in two days utilizing sets that had been left standing from A Bucket of Blood . 
 The film slowly gained a cult following through word of mouth when it was distributed as the B movie in a double feature with Mario Bava 's Black Sunday and eventually with The Last Woman on Earth . The film 's popularity increased with local television broadcasts , in addition to the presence of a young Jack Nicholson , whose small role in the film has been prominently promoted on home video releases of the film . The movie was the basis for an Off Broadway musical , Little Shop of Horrors , which was made into a 1986 feature film and enjoyed a Broadway revival , all of which have attracted attention to the 1960 film . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On Los Angeles 's skid row , penny @-@ pinching Gravis Mushnick ( Mel Welles ) owns a florist shop which is staffed by him and his two employees , the sweet but simple Audrey <unk> ( Jackie Joseph ) and clumsy Seymour Krelboyne ( Jonathan Haze ) . Although the rundown shop gets little business , there are some repeat customers ; for instance , Mrs. Siddie Shiva ( <unk> <unk> ) shops almost daily for flower arrangements for her many relatives ' funerals . Another regular customer is Burson Fouch ( Dick Miller ) , who eats the plants he buys for lunch . When Seymour fouls up the arrangement of Dr. Farb ( John <unk> ) , a sadistic dentist , Mushnick fires him . Hoping Mushnick will change his mind , Seymour tells him about a special plant that he crossbred from a butterwort and a Venus flytrap . <unk> , Seymour admits that he named the plant " Audrey Jr . " , a revelation that delights the real Audrey . 
 From the apartment he shares with his hypochondriac mother , Winifred ( Myrtle Vail ) , Seymour fetches his odd @-@ looking , potted plant , but Mushnick is unimpressed by its sickly , drooping look . However , when Fouch suggests that Audrey Jr . ' s uniqueness might attract people from all over the world to see it , Mushnick gives Seymour one week to revive it . Seymour has already discovered that the usual kinds of plant food do not nourish his strange hybrid and that every night at sunset the plant 's leaves open up . When Seymour accidentally pricks his finger on another thorny plant , Audrey Jr. opens wider , eventually causing Seymour to discover that the plant craves blood . After that , each night Seymour nurses his creation with blood from his fingers . Although he feels increasingly listless , Audrey Jr. begins to grow and the shop 's revenues increase due to the curious customers who are lured in to see the plant . 
 The plant ( voiced by writer Charles B. Griffith ) develops the ability to speak and demands that Seymour feed him . Now anemic and not knowing what to feed the plant , Seymour takes a walk along a railroad track . When he carelessly throws a rock to vent his frustration , he inadvertently knocks out a man who falls on the track and is run over by a train . <unk> guilt @-@ ridden but resourceful , Seymour collects the body parts and feeds them to Audrey Jr . Meanwhile , at a restaurant , Mushnick discovers he has no money with him , and when he returns to the shop to get some cash , he secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant . Although Mushnick intends to tell the police , he <unk> by the next day when he sees the line of people waiting to spend money at his shop . 
 When Seymour later arrives that morning suffering a toothache , Mushnick sends Seymour to Dr. Farb , who tries to remove several of his teeth without anesthetic to get even with Seymour for ruining Farb 's flowers . Grabbing a sharp tool , Seymour fights back and accidentally stabs and kills Farb . Seymour is horrified that he has now murdered twice and after posing as a dentist to avoid the suspicion of Farb 's masochistic patient Wilbur Force ( Jack Nicholson ) , Seymour feeds Farb 's body to Audrey Jr . The unexplained disappearance of the two men attract the attention of the police and Mushnick finds himself questioned by Det . Joe Fink ( Wally Campo ) and his assistant Sgt. Frank Stoolie ( Jack <unk> ) ( take @-@ offs of Dragnet characters Joe Friday and Frank Smith , ) . Although Mushnick acts suspiciously nervous , Fink and Stoolie conclude that he knows nothing . Audrey Jr . , which has grown several feet tall , is beginning to bud , as is the relationship between Seymour and Audrey ( whom Seymour invites on a date ) . 
 When a representative of the Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California comes to the shop to check out the plant , she announces that Seymour will soon receive a trophy from them and that she will return when the plant 's buds open . While Seymour is on a date with Audrey , Mushnick stays at the shop to see that Audrey Jr. eats no one else . After trading barbs with the plant when Audrey awakens and requests to be fed , Mushnick finds himself at the mercy of a robber ( Charles B. Griffith ) who believes that the huge crowd he had observed attending the shop indicated the presence of a large amount of money . To save his own life , Mushnick tricks the robber into thinking that the money is at the bottom of the plant who then eats him . Not only does the monstrous plant 's growth increase with this latest meal , but its intelligence and abilities do as well . It intimidates Mr. Mushnick , who is now more terrified than ever , but not so much that he will pass up on the money the plant is bringing in as an attraction . After he is forced to damage his relationship with Audrey to keep her from discovering the plant 's nature , an angry Seymour confronts the plant asserting he will no longer do its bidding just because it orders him . The plant then employs hypnosis on the feckless lad and commands him to bring it more food . He wanders the night streets aimlessly until pursued by a rather aggressively persistent high @-@ end call girl , Leonora Clyde ( Meri Welles ) , intent on making a score . Believing him harmless , she flirts with him to no avail until he inadvertently knocks her out with a rock and carries her back to feed Audrey Jr . 
 Still lacking clues about the mysterious disappearances of the two men , Fink and Stoolie attend a special sunset celebration at the shop during which Seymour is to be presented with the trophy and Audrey Jr . ' s buds are expected to open . As the attendees look on , four buds open and inside each flower is the face of one of the plant 's victims . As the crowd breaks out in shock and fright , Fink and Stoolie realize Seymour is their culprit who flees from the shop with the police and Mushnick in hot pursuit . Managing to lose them in a junk yard filled with sinks and toilets , Seymour eventually makes his way back to Mushnick 's shop . Audrey Jr. screams , " Feed me ! " Seymour curses the plant for ruining his life . He grabs a kitchen knife and climbs into Audrey Jr . ' s maw , saying , " I 'll feed you like you never been fed before ! " 
 Later that evening , Audrey , Winifred , Mushnick , Fink , and Stoolie return to the shop where they discover that Audrey Jr. has begun to wither and die . As Winifred laments over how her son used to be such a good boy , one final bud opens to reveal the face of Seymour , which pitifully moans , " I didn 't mean it ! " before drooping over — apparently ending the life of Audrey , Jr .
