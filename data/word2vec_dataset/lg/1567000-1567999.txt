 The album cover was photographed by Cobain 's then @-@ girlfriend Tracy <unk> during a concert at the Reko Muse art gallery in Olympia , Washington . On February 25 , 1989 , Nirvana played at venues on the west coast , including the University of Washington . The group began its first European tour , a double headliner with the band Tad , at the Riverside venue in Newcastle upon Tyne on October 23 , 1989 . On December 3 , they played a " triumphant " set at the London Astoria . Christopher Sandford related : " when the style pundits noted Cobain 's ' patent lumberjack shirts and ugly fifties geometric @-@ patterned jerseys ' , seeing an example of ' low @-@ couture chic ' they missed the point that flannel shirts and sweaters were everyday dress in the marine climate of the Northwest " . Cobain took note and said that he never intended to start a fad or act as a role model . 
 The album 's working title was Too Many Humans . It was renamed Bleach after Cobain found an AIDS prevention poster while Nirvana was driving through San Francisco . The poster advised heroin addicts to bleach their needles before use , featuring the slogan " Bleach Your Works " . In Australia , Bleach was released on Waterfront Records and re @-@ issued on various colored covers and colored vinyl prior to 1992 . 
 Due to increasing dissatisfaction with Everman over the course of the Bleach tour , Nirvana canceled the last few dates and drove back to Washington . No one told Everman he was fired at the time , while Everman later claimed that he actually quit the group . Although Sub Pop did not promote Bleach as much as other releases , it was a steady seller . However , Cobain was upset by the label 's lack of promotion and distribution for the album . 
 In April 1992 , following the success of Nirvana 's second album Nevermind , Sub Pop released a remastered version of Bleach on LP , CD and cassette , adding two extra tracks . Geffen Records handled the international release . The CD version was packaged in a cardboard foldout case that included a bonus booklet filled with photos of the band from 1987 – 1990 . For the 20th anniversary of the album , Sub Pop released on November 3 , 2009 a deluxe reissue of Bleach featuring a March 2009 remastering from the original tapes by George Marino and a live recording of a 1990 show at Portland , Oregon 's Pine Street Theatre .

 Bleach did not sell well but received positive reviews from critics when it was first released . Anthony Carew from the About.com Guide said that the album " define [ d ] the entire decade of the ' 90s " , and awarded it four out of five stars . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album three and a half out of five stars , noting that " Kurt Cobain illustrated signs of his considerable songcraft , particularly on the minor @-@ key ballad ' About a Girl ' and the dense churn of ' Blew ' " . He also said that " it 's a debut from a band that shows potential but haven 't yet achieved it . " NME 's Edwin Pouncey said that the album was the " biggest , baddest sound that Sub Pop have so far managed to unearth . So primitive that they manage to make label mates Mudhoney sound like Genesis , Nirvana turn up the volume and spit and claw their way to the top of the musical garbage heap " , and gave it an eight out of ten rating . Bleach was considered by Rolling Stone as " a moderate hit on college radio and the underground / DIY circuit . " 
 Before Nevermind was released , Bleach had sold 40 @,@ 000 units in North America . The 1992 re @-@ release of the album was more successful on the charts , with Bleach eventually reaching number 89 at the Billboard 200 , number 33 on the UK album charts , number 34 on the Australian Recording Industry Association chart , and number 22 on the Finland charts . Kurt Cobain 's death in 1994 also led to a resurgence of popularity , with Bleach entering the Top Pop Catalog chart at number six in the week following his death , and eventually earning the top spot on May 7 . The 2009 deluxe edition entered the Catalog Albums chart at number seven . Bleach was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in February 1995 , and has sold an estimated 1 @.@ 7 million units in the United States . It has also been certified Gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association . It is Sub Pop 's best @-@ selling release .

 The Gangut @-@ class battleships , also known as the " Sevastopol class " , were the first dreadnoughts begun for the Imperial Russian Navy before World War I. They had a convoluted design history involving several British companies , evolving requirements , an international design competition , and foreign protests . Four ships were ordered in 1909 ; two were named after victorious battles of Peter the Great in the Great Northern War and the other two were named after battles in the Crimean War . Three ships of the class used names of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the Petropavlovsk @-@ class lost in the Russo @-@ Japanese War . Construction was delayed by financing problems until the Duma formally authorized the ships in 1911 . They were delivered from December 1914 through January 1915 , although they still needed work on the turrets and fire @-@ control systems until mid @-@ 1915 . Their role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans , who never tried to enter , so the ships spent their time training and providing cover for minelaying operations . Their crews participated in the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet after the February Revolution in 1917 , and joined the Bolsheviks the following year . The Russians were forced to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki after Finland became independent in December 1917 . The Gangut @-@ class ships led the first contingent of ships to Kronstadt even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen . 
 All of the dreadnoughts except for Petropavlovsk were laid up in October – November 1918 for lack of manpower . Poltava was severely damaged by a fire while laid up in 1919 . Petropavlovsk was retained in commission to defend Kronstadt and Leningrad against the British forces supporting the White Russians although she also helped to suppress a mutiny by the garrison of Fort Krasnaya Gorka in 1919 . Her crew , and that of the Sevastopol , joined the Kronstadt Rebellion of March 1921 . After it was bloodily crushed , those ships were given proper ' revolutionary ' names . The other two serviceable vessels were recommissioned and renamed in 1925 – 26 while some work was done to repair Frunze , as Poltava was now known , but the money quickly ran out for her repairs . Parizhskaya Kommuna , the former Sevastopol , was modified in 1928 to improve her sea @-@ keeping abilities so that she could be transferred to the Black Sea Fleet which had nothing heavier than a light cruiser available . This proved to be the first of a series of modernizations where each ship of the class was progressively reconstructed and improved . A number of proposals were made in the 1930s to rebuild Frunze to match her sisters or even as a battlecruiser by removing one turret , but these came to naught and she was hulked preparatory to scrapping . 
 The two ships of the Baltic Fleet did not play a prominent role in the Winter War , but did have their anti @-@ aircraft guns significantly increased before Operation Barbarossa in 1941 . However this did not help either ship as they attempted to provide fire support for the defenders of Leningrad . Marat had her bow blown off and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya was badly damaged by multiple bomb hits in September . The former was sunk , but later raised and became a floating battery for the duration of the Siege of Leningrad while the latter spent over a year under repair , although this was lengthened by subsequent bomb hits while in the hands of the shipyard . Both ships bombarded German and Finnish troops so long as they remained within reach , but Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya did not venture away from Kronstadt for the duration of the war . Parizhskaya Kommuna remained in Sevastopol until forced to evacuate by advancing German troops . She made one trip to besieged Sevastopol in December 1941 and made a number of bombardments in support of the Kerch Offensive during January – March 1942 . She was withdrawn from combat in April as German aerial supremacy had made it too risky to risk such a large target . 
 Sevastopol and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya remained on the active list after the end of the war although little is known of their activities . Both were reclassified as ' school battleships ' ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) in 1954 and stricken in 1956 after which they were slowly scrapped . There were several plans ( Project 27 ) to reconstruct Petropavlovsk using the bow of Frunze , but they were not accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948 . She was renamed Volkhov in 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken in 1953 and subsequently broken up . Frunze was finally scrapped beginning in 1949 .

 After the end of the Russo @-@ Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a state of confusion . Its leadership , tactics and ship designs had all been cast into disrepute by its repeated defeats by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima , Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of the Yellow Sea . The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design lessons from the war while the government reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many of its more conservative officers to retire . It conducted a design contest for a dreadnought in 1906 , but the Duma refused to authorize it , preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army . 
 The requirements for a new class of dreadnoughts were in a state of flux during 1907 , but Vickers Ltd submitted a design that met the latest specifications and was very nearly accepted by the Navy for a 22 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 22 @,@ 000 t ) ship with twelve 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns in triple , superimposed turrets . However rumors of a contract with Vickers raised a public outcry as they had some problems with the armored cruiser Rurik then building in England . The Naval Ministry defused the situation on 30 December 1907 by announcing an international design contest with the ship built in Russia regardless of the nationality of the winning firm . By the deadline of 12 March 1908 a total of 51 designs had been submitted by 13 different shipyards . The winner of the competition was a design from the German firm of Blohm & Voss , but the French protested that they did not want to see any of the money that they had loaned Russia to build up its defenses in German pockets . The Russians bought the design for 250 @,@ 000 rubles and shelved it to placate both sides . A design by the Baltic Works had been the runner @-@ up and was revised for the Navy 's updated requirements with a complete design to be presented by 22 March 1909 . This was extended by a month to allow the Baltic Works to finalize its contract with the British firm of John Brown & Company for design assistance with the hull form and machinery . 
 The Naval General Staff believed that a speed advantage over the 21 knots ( 24 mph ; 39 km / h ) German battle fleet would prove very useful in battle , as demonstrated at the Battle of Tsushima , but use of the heavy and bulky Belleville Water @-@ tube boilers , as insisted upon by the Engineering Section of the Naval Technical Committee , would prevent the new design from exceeding 21 @.@ 25 knots itself . However , after John Brown indicated that the ship 's turbines could deliver 45 @,@ 000 shp ( 33 @,@ 556 kW ) if supplied with enough steam and that the hull form could reach 23 knots ( 26 mph ; 43 km / h ) with 45 @,@ 000 horsepower , the Naval General Staff took the opportunity to get the speed it desired by using small @-@ tube boilers . It convened a meeting of the Naval Technical Committee to discuss the issue , but packed it with engineers from the fleet who were in favor of small @-@ tube boilers and the Engineering Section was outvoted . The Yarrow small @-@ tube boiler was significantly smaller and lighter than Belleville large @-@ tube boiler , but required more frequent cleaning and repair and their horsepower dropped off more rapidly with use . 
 The Russians did not believe that super firing turrets offered any advantage as they discounted the value of axial fire , believed that broadside fire was much more important and also believed that super firing turrets could not fire while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast interfering with the open sighting hoods in the lower turret 's roof . They therefore designed the ships with a ' linear ' arrangement ( <unk> <unk> ) of turrets distributed over the length of the ship . This arrangement had several advantages because it reduced the stress on the ends of the ship since the turrets were not concentrated at the end of the ship , increased stability because the lack of elevated turrets and their barbettes , improved the survivability of the ship because the magazines were separated from each other and gave a lower silhouette . Disadvantages were that the magazines had to be put in the middle of all the machinery , which required steam pipes to be run through or around them and the lack of deck space free from blast . This greatly complicated the placement of the anti @-@ torpedo boat guns which ultimately had to be mounted in the hull , closer to the water than was desirable . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Ganguts were 180 meters ( 590 ft ) long at the waterline and 181 @.@ 2 meters ( 594 ft 6 in ) long overall . They had a beam of 26 @.@ 9 meters ( 88 ft ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 99 meters ( 29 ft 6 in ) , 49 centimeters ( 1 ft 7 in ) more than designed . They were completed overweight and their displacement was 24 @,@ 800 metric tons ( 24 @,@ 400 long tons ) at load , over 1 @,@ 500 t ( 1 @,@ 500 long tons ; 1 @,@ 700 short tons ) more than their designed displacement of 23 @,@ 288 metric tons ( 22 @,@ 920 long tons ) . This reduced their freeboard by about 16 inches ( 41 cm ) and gave them a slight bow trim that made them very wet ships . 
 High @-@ tensile steel was used throughout the longitudinally @-@ framed hull with mild steel used only in areas that did not contribute to structural strength . This , plus refinements in the design process , meant that the hull was 19 % lighter than that of the preceding Andrei Pervozvanny class pre @-@ dreadnoughts . The hull was subdivided by 13 transverse watertight bulkheads and had a double bottom . The engine and condenser rooms were divided by two longitudinal bulkheads . They had two electrically driven rudders on the centerline , the main rudder abaft the smaller auxiliary rudder . Their designed metacentric height was 1 @.@ 76 meters ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Ten Parsons @-@ type steam turbines drove the four propellers . The engine rooms were located between turrets three and four in three transverse compartments . The outer compartments each had a high @-@ pressure ahead and reverse turbine for each wing propeller shaft . The central engine room had two each low @-@ pressure ahead and astern turbines as well as two cruising turbines driving the two center shafts . The engines had a total designed output of 42 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 31 @,@ 000 kW ) , but they produced 52 @,@ 000 shp ( 39 @,@ 000 kW ) during Poltava 's full @-@ speed trials on 21 November 1915 and gave a top speed of 24 @.@ 1 knots ( 44 @.@ 6 km / h ; 27 @.@ 7 mph ) . Twenty @-@ five Yarrow Admiralty @-@ type small @-@ tube boilers provided steam to the engines at a designed working pressure of 17 @.@ 5 atm ( 1 @,@ 773 kPa ; 257 psi ) . Each boiler was fitted with Thornycroft oil sprayers for mixed oil / coal burning . They were arranged in two groups . The forward group consisted of two boiler rooms in front of the second turret , the foremost of which had three boilers while the second one had six . The rear group was between the second and third turrets and comprised two compartments , each with eight boilers . At full load they carried 1 @,@ 847 @.@ 5 long tons ( 1 @,@ 877 @.@ 1 t ) of coal and 700 long tons ( 710 t ) of fuel oil and that provided her a range of 3 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 500 km ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main armament consisted of a dozen Obukhovskii 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) Pattern 1907 52 @-@ caliber guns mounted in four electrically powered triple turrets . The guns could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to 25 ° . They could be loaded at any angle between − 5 ° and + 15 ° ; their rate of fire was one round every 30 to 40 seconds up to 15 ° of elevation and one round per minute above that . The forward turret had an arc of fire of 330 ° , the second turret had a total of 280 ° , the third turret 310 ° and the aft turret 300 ° . They could elevate at 3 – 4 ° per second and traverse at a rate of 3 @.@ 2 ° per second . 100 rounds per gun were carried at full load . The guns fired 470 @.@ 9 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 038 lb ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 762 m / s ( 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ) ; this provided a maximum range of 23 @,@ 230 meters ( 25 @,@ 400 yd ) . 
 Sixteen manually operated 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) 50 @-@ caliber Pattern 1905 guns were mounted in the hull in casemates as the secondary battery intended to defend the ship against torpedo boats . Because of the lack of freeboard and bow @-@ heavy trim the forward casemates were often washed out in even moderate seas . All guns had a firing arc of 125 ° – 30 ° and at least four could bear on any part of the horizon . Their maximum elevation was 25 ° and they could elevate at 3 @.@ 5 ° per second . They could traverse at six to eight degrees per second . 300 rounds per gun were provided which was increased from 245 rounds during construction . As designed they were 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) above the waterline , but this was reduced in service as they were overweight . They had a rate of fire was seven rounds per minute and a maximum range of about 16 @,@ 800 yards ( 15 @,@ 362 m ) at 25 ° elevation with a 63 @.@ 87 @-@ pound ( 28 @.@ 97 kg ) semi @-@ armor @-@ piercing Model 1911 shell at a muzzle velocity of 792 @.@ 5 m / s ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . 
 The Gangut @-@ class ships were completed with only a single 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) 30 @-@ caliber Lender anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) gun mounted on the quarterdeck . This had a maximum depression of 5 ° and a maximum elevation of 65 ° . It fired a 14 @.@ 33 @-@ pound ( 6 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 929 ft / s ( 588 m / s ) . It had a rate of fire of 10 – 12 rounds per minute and had a maximum ceiling of 19 @,@ 000 ft ( 5 @,@ 800 m ) . Other AA guns were probably added during the course of World War I , but details are lacking , although Conway 's says that four 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns were added to the roofs of the end turrets during the war . Four 17 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 450 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes were mounted with three torpedoes for each tube . 
 = = = Fire control = = = 
 Two Zeiss 5 @-@ meter ( 16 ft ) rangefinders were fitted on the conning towers and there was also a 4 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) Barr & Stroud instrument , possibly for precise <unk> on the master ship when concentrating fire . Two Krylov <unk> were situated in the lower level of the forward conning tower . These would provide data for the central artillery post to calculate with its imported Pollen Argo Mark V Clock , a mechanical fire @-@ control computer , and then transmit the gun commands via the Geisler transmission system for the gun crew to follow . During the winter of 1915 – 16 the Zeiss rangefinders were transferred to armored hoods on the rear of the fore and aft turrets and , at some point , 18 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) Barr & Stroud rangefinders were added to the roofs of the middle turrets . Gangut received a 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) Pollen rangefinder in the spring of 1916 . 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 The armor protection of the Gangut @-@ class ships had to protect against two different threats as revealed during the Russo @-@ Japanese War . Japanese high explosive shells had riddled the unarmored portions of Russian ships and had even sunk several ships with their heavy armor belts <unk> . The Russians decided that the entire side of the ship needed to be armored , even though this would limit the thickness of the main belt . They developed a system where the outer armor would break up or at least slow shells down and burst immediately behind the outer armor and an inboard armor bulkhead would stop the splinters and shell fragments from reaching the vitals . This system likely would have worked against the British armor @-@ piercing shells that performed so badly at the Battle of Jutland , but would have failed against the improved shells introduced afterwards with their redesigned fuses . A related weakness was that the turrets and conning towers lacked the inboard splinter bulkhead even though they used armor thickness roughly equivalent to that of the main belt . 
 The waterline belt , made of Krupp cemented armor ( KCA ) , had a maximum thickness of 225 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) , but tapered to about 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) on its bottom edge . It was 117 @.@ 2 meters ( 385 ft ) long and had a total height of 5 meters ( 16 ft ) , 3 @.@ 26 meters ( 10 ft 8 in ) of which was above the design waterline and 1 @.@ 74 meters ( 5 ft 9 in ) below . However , the ship 's draft was almost 50 to 79 centimeters ( 20 to 31 in ) deeper than intended , which meant that much less was above water . The remaining portion of the waterline was protected by 125 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) plates . The upper belt , which protected the casemates , was 125 mm of KCA over the citadel and 2 @.@ 72 meters ( 8 ft 11 in ) high . It thinned to a thickness of 75 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) forward of the citadel . The area aft of the citadel was the only unprotected section of the hull . 3 @.@ 4 meters ( 11 ft ) inboard of the side was a longitudinal splinter bulkhead made of Krupp non @-@ cemented armor ( KNC ) . It was 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick at the level of the main belt , but thinned to 37 @.@ 55 mm ( 1 @.@ 478 in ) behind the upper belt . The main deck sloped from the bulkhead to the lower edge of the waterline belt and consisted of a 50 @-@ mm KNC plate on a 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 in ) mild steel plate . This space was used as a coal bunker , which added extra protection . The main belt was closed off by 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) transverse bulkheads fore and aft and the steering gear was protected by armor 100 – 125 mm thick . 
 The main gun turrets had a KCA face and sides 203 mm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) thick with a 100 @-@ mm roof . The guns had 3 @-@ inch gun shields to protect against splinters entering the embrasures and they were separated by splinter bulkheads . The barbettes were 150 mm thick above the upper deck , but reduced to 75 mm behind other armor , except for the fore and aft barbettes which only thinned to 125 mm . The conning tower sides were 254 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) thick with a 100 @-@ mm roof . The 120 @-@ mm guns had their own individual 3 @-@ inch gun shields . The funnel uptakes were protected by 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 87 in ) of armor . The upper deck was 37 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 @.@ 48 in ) of nickel @-@ chrome steel and the middle deck was 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) of nickel @-@ chrome steel between the longitudinal splinter bulkheads , but thinned to 19 mm ( 0 @.@ 75 in ) outside them . The lower deck was of 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 in ) mild steel . 
 Underwater protection was minimal as there was only a single watertight bulkhead , presumably of high @-@ tensile steel , behind the upwards extension of the double bottom . This was an extension of the splinter bulkhead and was also 3 @.@ 4 meters inboard . A more comprehensive system was considered early in the design process but rejected because it would have cost some 500 – 600 t ( 490 – 590 long tons ; 550 – 660 short tons ) . 
 The armor scheme of the Gangut @-@ class ships had some significant weaknesses . The rear transverse bulkhead was unprotected by any other armor but was the same thickness as the forward bulkhead which was defended by the upper belt armor . The thinness of the barbette armor was a serious defect which could have proved fatal in a battle . And the lack of a splinter bulkhead behind the armor of the turrets , barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations vulnerable to main gun hits . But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti @-@ torpedo bulkhead , which made them highly vulnerable to mines or torpedoes . 
 = = Construction = = 
 All four ships were laid down on 16 June 1909 , but this was just a ceremonial event as actual work did not begin until September – October . One major complication was that the design for the turrets and their magazines was not completed when construction began so their weights and dimensions had to be estimated . The machinery for these ships was built by either the Baltic Works or the Franco @-@ Russian Works as the New Admiralty Shipyard lacked its own engine shop . Construction was initially very slow because the Duma did not allocate any money for these ships until May 1911 . Initial funding was taken from other budget items or the emperor 's discretionary fund and the shipyards had to use their own money to keep the work going . They were enormously expensive with their cost estimated at 29 @.@ 4 million rubles each , including armament . By way of comparison the preceding class of pre @-@ dreadnoughts had only cost 11 million rubles each . Once the Duma provided the funding the pace of work accelerated and the ships were launched later that year , although delays in the delivery of engines and turrets hindered their completion . All of the ships completed abbreviated trials by the end of 1914 and reached the fleet in December 1914 – January 1915 .

 All four of the Ganguts were assigned to the First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet in December 1914 – January 1915 when they reached Helsingfors . Their turrets and fire @-@ control systems , however , were still being adjusted and fine @-@ tuned through the next spring . Their role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans , who never tried to enter , so they spent their time training with occasional sorties into the Baltic . Several ships ran aground in 1915 and 1916 , often while providing cover for minelaying operations , but only Sevastopol suffered any significant damage . A minor mutiny broke out on 1 November on board Gangut when the executive officer refused to feed the crew the traditional meal of meat and macaroni after coaling . The crews of the battleships joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet on 16 March 1917 , after the idle sailors received word of the February Revolution in Saint Petersburg . The Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over . Gangut and her sisters led the first group of ships on 12 March and reached Kronstadt five days later in what became known as the ' Ice Voyage ' .

 All of the dreadnoughts except for Petropavlovsk were laid up in October – November 1918 for lack of manpower . She bombarded the rebellious garrison of Fort Krasnaya Gorka in 1919 and supported Bolshevik light forces operating against British ships supporting the White Russians in the Gulf of Finland . On 17 August 1919 Petropavlovsk was claimed as torpedoed and put out of action by the British Coastal Motor Boat CMB 88 in Kronstadt harbor , but was , in fact , not damaged at all . On 24 November 1919 a fire broke out in Poltava 's forward boiler room and gutted much of her interior ; she was never repaired although numerous proposals were made to reconstruct her . The crews of Sevastopol and Petropavlovsk joined the Kronstadt Rebellion of 1921 and they were renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna and Marat respectively after the rebellion was crushed to commemorate the Paris Commune and to erase their ' betrayal ' of the Communist Party . The two undamaged ships were recommissioned in 1925 – 26 and all the ships were given proper revolutionary names . 
 The initial attempts to return Frunze to service were to restore her to original design , but money ran out before she was even half completed . Subsequent plans that focused on reconstructing her as a modernized equivalent to her sisters or even as a battlecruiser , with one turret deleted to save weight , were considered , but finally abandoned on 23 January 1935 when all work was stopped . 
 Parizhskaya Kommuna was refitted in 1928 in preparation for her transfer to the Black Sea Fleet the next year and she was given an open @-@ topped false bow to improve her sea @-@ keeping ability . However , while en route through the Bay of Biscay , she was caught in a heavy storm that damaged the bow and she was forced to put into Brest for repairs . Marat was the first of the class to be reconstructed between 1928 and 8 April 1931 . Her superstructure was enlarged , her guns were replaced , the turrets overhauled , the anti @-@ aircraft armament augmented and the fire @-@ control equipment modernized . Her boilers were converted to burn only fuel oil and this produced enough steam that the forward three boilers could be removed and the boiler room was turned into anti @-@ aircraft magazines and control spaces . The forward funnel was angled to the rear and extended to try to keep the exhaust out of the gunnery spaces and the bridge . She was also given a false bow , but hers had a solid top that turned it into a forecastle . Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya was the next ship to rebuilt and profited from the experiences of her sister 's modernization between 1931 and 1934 . All twenty @-@ five of her old boilers were replaced by a dozen oil @-@ fired boilers originally intended for the Borodino @-@ class battlecruiser Izmail . The space saved was used to add another inboard longitudinal watertight bulkhead that greatly improved her underwater protection . The rest of her modernization was along the same lines as Marat 's , except that the latter 's tubular foremast was replaced by a sturdier semi @-@ conical mast , a new aft structure was built in front of the rear conning tower which caused the mainmast to be moved forward , her forward funnel was curved to the rear to better keep the bridge clear of exhaust gases and the thickness of her turret roofs was increased to 152 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) . Parizhskaya Kommuna began her two @-@ stage reconstruction in 1933 along the lines of Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya 's modernization . Major differences were that her guns and turrets were improved to increase their rate of fire to about two rounds per minutes and to extend their range , she was the first ship of the class to receive light anti @-@ aircraft guns and her forward funnel was given a more sinuous curve to direct its exhaust gases away from the forward superstructure . She completed these alterations in 1938 , but was returned to the dockyard from December 1939 through July 1940 to receive a new armored deck and anti @-@ torpedo bulges which cured her stability problems and greatly increased her underwater protection at a modest cost in speed .

 The participation of Marat and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya in the Winter War was limited to a bombardment of Finnish coastal artillery in December 1939 at Saarenpää in the Beryozovye Islands before the Gulf of Finland iced over . They failed to inflict any permanent damage before being driven off by near misses . Both ships had their anti @-@ aircraft armament modernized and reinforced over the winter of 1939 – 40 and were transferred to Tallinn shortly after the Soviets occupied Estonia in 1940 . Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya received more AA guns in February – March 1941 . Parizhskaya Kommuna received a more modest number of AA guns while she was receiving her bulges , but landed four 120 @-@ mm guns right before the Germans invaded . 
 On 22 June 1941 , the Germans attacked the Soviet Union under the codename of Operation Barbarossa ; on that date Marat was in Kronstadt and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya was in Tallinn . The latter was soon forced to fall back to Kronstadt by the speed of the German advance and neither of the Baltic Fleet dreadnoughts participated in combat until 8 September when they fired on troops of the German 18th Army from positions near Kronstadt and Leningrad . Marat was lightly damaged by German 15 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns on 16 September and had her bow blown off on 23 September by two bomb hits . One of which was claimed by Lieutenant Hans @-@ Ulrich Rudel of III . / StG 2 flying a Junkers Ju 87B ' Stuka ' , that detonated her forward magazine . She sank in the shallow water from progressive flooding , but was raised and used as a floating artillery battery for the rest of the war using two , and later , three of her gun turrets . Marat reverted to her original name on 31 May 1943 . Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya was badly damaged on 21 September 1941 by three bomb hits on her bow that knocked out two of her turrets . She was sent for repairs at the Ordzhonikidze Yard on 23 October , although she was hit by more bombs on two different occasions while under repair until November 1942 . Her AA armament was further reinforced during this period and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya returned to her mission of providing fire support during the Siege of Leningrad , the Leningrad – Novgorod Offensive in January 1944 and the Vyborg – Petrozavodsk Offensive in June 1944 . She was the last Soviet battleship to fire shots in anger on 9 June 1944 during the latter offensive . On 22 July 1944 , the ship was awarded the Order of the Red Banner . Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya received a Lend @-@ Lease British Type 279 air @-@ warning radar sometime during 1944 . 
 During the late 1930s Frunze was used as a barracks hulk while she was stripped for parts , until she was formally discarded 1 December 1940 , after scrapping had already begun at a leisurely pace . After the German invasion she was towed to Kronstadt and run aground in late July 1941 near the Leningrad Sea Canal . During the Siege of Leningrad her hull was used as a base for small ships . Frunze raised on 31 May 1944 , towed to Leningrad and scrapped beginning in 1949 .

 Parizhskaya Kommuna was in Sevastopol and remained until 30 October 1941 when she was evacuated to Novorossiysk after the Germans had breached Soviet defensive lines near the Perekop Isthmus . The ship fired her first shots of the war on 28 – 29 November when she bombarded German and Romanian troops south of Sevastopol . Parizhskaya Kommuna made one evacuation run to Sevastopol on 29 December , bombarding German troops on her arrival , but spent most of her time supporting troops during the Kerch Offensive in January – March 1942 . She fired her last shots of the war at targets near Feodosiya during the nights of 20 – 22 March 1942 before returning to Poti to have her worn @-@ out 12 @-@ inch guns relined . By the time this was finished the Soviets were unwilling to expose such a prominent ship to German air attacks , which had already sunk a number of cruisers and destroyers . She returned to her original name on 31 May 1943 , but remained in Poti until late 1944 when she led the surviving major units of the Black Sea Fleet back to Sevastopol on 5 November . British Type 290 and 291 air @-@ warning radars were fitted during the war . Sevastopol was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 8 July 1945 . 
 = = = Postwar = = = 
 Sevastopol and Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya remained on the active list after the end of the war although little is known of their activities . Both were reclassified as ' school battleships ' ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) on 24 July 1954 and stricken on 17 February 1956 . Their scrapping began that same year although Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya 's hulk was still in existence in May 1958 . 
 After the war there were several plans ( Project 27 ) to reconstruct Petropavlovsk , as she was now known , using the bow of Frunze and moving her third turret to the forward position , but they were not accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948 . She was renamed Volkhov , after the nearby river , on 28 November 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken on 4 September 1953 and broken up afterwards . 
 After World War II two of Frunze 's turrets and their guns were used to rebuild Coast Defense Battery 30 ( Maksim Gor 'kii I ) in Sevastopol . It remained in service with the Soviet Navy through 1997 . 
 = Seaxburh of Ely = 
 Seaxburh ( Old English : <unk> ) ; also Saint <unk> of Ely , ( died about 699 ) was the queen of King Eorcenberht of Kent , as well as an abbess and a saint of the Christian Church . 
 Seaxburh 's sisters were Æthelburg of Faremoutiers , <unk> , Æthelthryth and possibly <unk> . Her marriage to Eorcenberht produced two sons , both of whom ruled , and two daughters . After her husband 's death in 664 , Seaxburh remained in Kent to bring up her children . She acted as regent until her young son Ecgberht came of age . 
 Seaxburh founded the abbeys at Milton Regis and Minster @-@ in @-@ Sheppey , where her daughter Ermenilda was also a nun . She moved to the double monastery at Ely where her sister Æthelthryth was abbess and succeeded her when Æthelthryth died in 679 . According to Bede , in 695 , Seaxburh organised the movement ( or translation ) of Æthelthryth 's remains to a marble sarcophagus , after they had lain for sixteen years in a common grave . On opening the grave , it was discovered that her body was miraculously preserved . The legend is described in Bede 's Ecclesiastical History of the English People , which celebrates the saintly virtues of Æthelthryth , but speaks less highly of Seaxburh , referring only to her marriage , succession as abbess and translation of her sister 's relics . The date of Seaxburh 's death at Ely is not known . The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge , compiled after 1106 , describe her early life , marriage to Eorcenberht , retirement from secular life and her final years as a nun and abbess at Ely . 
 = = Family = = 
 Seaxburh was a daughter of Anna , King of East Anglia , the son of Eni , who ruled the East Angles from the early 640s and was slain together with his son Jurmin , at the Battle of Bulcamp in 653 or 654 . She was the sister of Æthelburg and <unk> , who were both abbesses of Faremoutiers Abbey in Brie , and also the sister of Æthelthryth , who married firstly <unk> , an <unk> of the South Gyrwe in the Fens , and secondly Ecgfrith of Northumbria . <unk> , who died in 743 , may also have been her sister . 
 Seaxburh married Eorcenberht of Kent , and was the mother of kings Ecgberht ( d . 673 ) , Hlothhere ( d . 685 ) , and of Saints Eormenhild and <unk> . Seaxburh was buried at Ely with her sisters Æthelthryth Wihtburh , and with her daughter Eormenhild . 
 = = Marriage and widowhood = = 
 Seaxburh was connected with the royal family of the Magonsætan by her marriage to Eorcenberht , who was king of Kent from 640 to 664 . Eorcenberht was the great @-@ uncle of <unk> and her sisters , the daughters of King Merewalh of the Magonsætan . 
 Their sons Ecgberht and Hlothhere both became kings of Kent . Their daughter <unk> was a nun at Faremoutiers , who was eventually canonised . Eorcenberht is mentioned in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle within the annal for 640 : " Then his son Eorcenberht succeeded to the kingdom ; he overthrew all devil @-@ worship in his kingdom , and was the first of the English kings to establish the Easter festival " . In the same passage is the Chronicle 's single reference to Seaxburh and Eorcengota , " ... <unk> <unk> wæs ge <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> wæs <unk> Annan <unk> East Engla <unk> " – ' ... his daughter was called Eorcengota , a holy and a remarkable person , whose mother was Seaxburh , daughter of Anna , king of the East Anglians ' . Seaxburh and Eorcenberht had a second daughter , Ermenilda , who married Wulfhere of Mercia and after his death became a nun and was later canonised . According to Barbara Yorke , Seaxburh 's marriage was itself of seminal importance in the establishment of monastic life for women during the Anglo @-@ Saxon period , as she became an example of an ex @-@ queen who made retreating to an nunnery a desirable royal vocation . 
 Eorcenberht died on 14 July 664 , in an outbreak of plague that occurred that year . After her husband 's death , Seaxburh remained in Kent to bring up her children . She played an important political and religious influence in the kingdom : she acted as regent for her son Ecgberht , ruling Kent until her young son came of age , and was the founder of Kent 's first abbey for women at Milton . Thereafter , Seaxburh became a nun and founded the abbey of Minster @-@ in @-@ Sheppey . According to the Liber Eliensis , a 12th @-@ century chronicle and history written at Ely , an English source related that Seaxburh received " the veil of holiness " from Theodore , the Archbishop of Canterbury , in her church on the Isle of Sheppey and that her daughter Eormenhild also became a nun there . Seaxburh is said by her hagiographer to have sought refuge as a nun after living a secular role that she had found hard to tolerate : having reluctantly submitted to marriage , she hastened from <unk> to " a timely widowhood and a hasty withdrawal to the religious life " , according to Susan Ridyard . 
 For a family tree of the ancestors of Seaxburh , see Wuffingas . 
 = = Religious life at Ely = = 
 Shortly afterwards Seaxburh moved to the double monastery at Ely , which was the precursor to Ely Cathedral , and where her sister Æthelthryth was abbess . The historian Barbara Yorke mentions the possibility that Seaxburh and her namesake Seaxburh of Wessex were the same person , but also notes that the accounts of Seaxburh 's religious life at Ely contradict this suggestion . 
 According to Yorke , Seaxburh 's retirement to Ely is an example an Anglo @-@ Saxon custom , represented in a law , whereby a married woman remained the responsibility of the paternal side of her family , perhaps to spend the rest of her days as a nun or an abbess . Described by the Liber Eliensis as a " <unk> virago " , or precious lady @-@ warrior , she succeeded as abbess when Æthelthryth died , probably of plague , in 679 . Seaxburh 's previous political experience in East Anglia and Kent would have been useful in preparing her for the role of abbess at the double monastery at Ely . 
 In 695 , in a vivid demonstration of the dynastic value of the cult of royal saints in Anglo @-@ Saxon England , Seaxburh decided to translate the remains of her sister Æthelthryth , who had been dead for sixteen years , from a common grave to the new church at Ely . Professor Patrick Sims @-@ Williams has identified Seaxburh as " the chief mover behind the translation of her body and the <unk> of her cult " . The Liber Eliensis describes these events in detail . When her grave was opened , Æthelthryth 's body was discovered to be uncorrupted and her coffin and clothes proved to possess miraculous powers . A sarcophagus made of white marble was taken from the Roman ruins at Grantchester , which was found to be the right fit for Æthelthryth . The architectural historian John Crook questions how such miraculous coincidences feature in hagiographies ( the studies of the lives of saints ) , when he observes that " the miraculous discovery of a suitable coffin is , however , a hagiographic commonplace " . Seaxburh 's supervised the preparation of her sister 's body , which was washed and wrapped in new robes before being reburied . She apparently oversaw the translation of her sister 's remains without the supervision of her bishop , using her knowledge of procedures gained from her family 's links with the abbey at Faremoutiers as a basis for the ceremony . 
 The fourth book of the Ecclesiastical History of the English People , completed by the Northumbrian monk Bede in 731 , celebrates the monastery at Ely and focuses on Æthelthryth 's piety and the translation of her relics . Bede does not mention the <unk> succession established at Ely by Æthelthryth , where power passed in turn to Seaxburh before subsequently transferring to Seaxburh 's daughter Eormenhild and to her granddaughter , <unk> . He praises the virtues of Æthelthryth , a princess who was married twice but still preserved her virginity . Seaxburh receives little praise from Bede , as she had borne children before becoming a nun . He only mentions Seaxburh 's marriage to Eorcenberht , succession as abbess and translation of her sister 's relics . 
 = = Death and veneration = = 
 The date of Seaxburh 's death is not known , but when she died at Ely , she was at " a good , late age " , according to the Liber Eliensis , which also related that ' Richard , Bishop of Ely ' translated the remains of Seaxburh and of " all the saintly women reposing in that place " . Her feast day is 6 July . 
 Seaxburh is mentioned in a written account of Kent 's earliest Christian kings and their canonised relatives , known as the Kentish Royal Legend ( Old English : <unk> <unk> ) . These kings , queens and princesses were unified by their holiness and royal connections . Pauline Stafford notes that the Legend " may have been a Christian alternative to pagan genealogy " to the rulers of 10th- and 11th @-@ century mediaeval England , as it described an earlier period of sustained Christian piety within the royal dynasty of Kent . Being both a queen and a saint , Seaxburh was held in high regard within the Legend : within it her role as queen and the founder of the minster at Sheppey was highlighted . 
 The 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia lists several separate accounts of the saint 's deeds and miracles , or so @-@ called Lives . The Life ( or Vita ) printed in John Capgrave 's Nova , <unk> and used by the <unk> , was perhaps copied from a Cotton manuscript in the British Museum . There is another Vita in Latin in the same collection , but it was so damaged by fire that it is useless . The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge were compiled after 1106 ( the year the relics of Seaxburh were translated ) and are copies from an earlier manuscript , now lost . The Vita describes Seaxburh 's early life , marriage to Eorcenberht , withdrawal to Milton and then Minster @-@ in @-@ Sheppey , and her final years as a nun and the abbess at Ely . The section relating to her life at Sheppey is similar to another fragment , dating between the 9th and 11th centuries , and currently kept at Lambeth Palace . It has been suggested that part of the Vita Sexburge was derived from this manuscript , or that both parts originated from an earlier version of Seaxburh 's Life .

 Dan Gibbs ( born c . 1976 ) is a legislator in the U.S. state of Colorado . 
 Gibbs worked as an outdoor guide and as a staffer for U.S. Representative Mark Udall before being elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Democrat in 2006 . In the legislature , Gibbs was noted for his focus on transportation and environment issues in the state legislature , particularly in response the fire dangers posted by Colorado 's mountain pine beetle epidemic — Gibbs is a volunteer wildland firefighter and has served fighting fires in Colorado and California . 
 Gibbs was appointed to a vacancy in the Colorado State Senate in late 2007 , won election to a Senate term of his own in 2008 , and currently represents a multi @-@ county region stretching from the Colorado Front Range near Boulder into Rocky Mountain ski country west of Denver . Gibbs rose quickly to chair the Colorado Senate 's Transportation Committee , but announced that he would seek election to a Summit County Commissioner seat in 2010 rather than run for another term in the legislature .

 Gibbs ' parents were both public school teachers and later school principals ; they divorced when Gibbs was young and he split his childhood between Gunnison , Colorado and East Lansing , Michigan . He was influenced at an early age toward public service after meeting former U.S. President Jimmy Carter . Gibbs earned a bachelor 's degree in sociology from Western State College , and then attended the University of Colorado at Denver , where he worked towards a graduate degree in political science . 
 Gibbs has worked in the timber industry , as a manager with a whitewater rafting company in Lake Luzerne , New York , and as an outdoor adventure guide in Gunnison , Colorado . As a local businessperson , he was a member of and diplomat for the Summit Chamber of Commerce , and was elected to their board for a three @-@ year term in 2006 . 
 An athlete and outdoorsman , Gibbs has competed in marathon and ultramarathon running races ( including the Leadville Trail 100 ) and helped coach the Battle Mountain High School cross @-@ country ski team . He has also volunteered with Habitat for Humanity , Eagle River Clean Up , and the I @-@ 70 Clean Up Team , and sat on the boards of Club 20 , the High Country Conservation Center , the Vail @-@ Eagle Valley Rotary Club , and Vail Valley Hospital Home Health / Hospice . He has cited being a volunteer youth mentor with the Buddy Mentors program as his most meaningful volunteer experience . 
 Gibbs worked in the Washington , DC office of U.S. Congressman Mark Udall before becoming the director for Udall 's Western Slope office in Minturn in 2003 .

 In his first year in the legislature — the 2007 session of the Colorado General Assembly — Gibbs sat on the House Agriculture , Livestock and Natural Resources Committee and was Vice @-@ Chair of the House Transportation and Energy Committee . That same year , Gibbs was also appointed to the Colorado <unk> Water Compact Committee and the board of directors of the Colorado Tourism office . 
 Starting when he was a staffer for Congressman Udall and continuing into his legislative career , Gibbs promoted increased government assistance on forest management issues , particularly in response to the increased fire danger caused by mountain pine beetle infestations . In the legislature , Gibbs sponsored legislation which established the Colorado Community Forest Restoration grant program , setting aside $ 1 million for projects to reduce fire risks . The bill was signed into law by Gov. Bill Ritter and ultimately yielded $ 176 @,@ 000 for forest restoration projects within Gibbs ' district . Following the legislative session , in order to better understand issues surrounding forest wildfires , Gibbs trained for and received certification in wildland firefighting , becoming certified Type II Wildland Firefighter with Lake Dillon Fire @-@ Rescue . Gibbs ' first deployment as a volunteer firefighter was to assist fighting the Santiago Fire during the October 2007 California wildfire epidemic . 
 After successfully sponsoring a 2007 bill requiring collaboration between the Colorado Oil and Gas Commission and Colorado Division of Wildlife to minimize the impact on wildlife from oil and gas drilling , Gibbs testified before the U.S. House 's Natural Resources committee on cooperative efforts between oil and environmental interests . 
 After initial resistance , Gibbs also successfully pushed legislation in 2007 to increase penalties for truck drivers who fail to comply with Colorado 's law requiring snow chain on roads in winter , a move designed to improve accessibility and safety on I @-@ 70 , which bisected Gibbs ' house district . In later years , Gibbs and state officials attributed decreases in accidents and tickets issued for violating the chain law to the passage of the bill .

 In his first year in the Colorado State Senate , Gibbs sat on the Senate Agriculture , Livestock , Natural Resources and Energy Committee and the Senate Transportation Committee — the counterparts of both of the House committees he served on — and was named vice @-@ chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee . He also co @-@ chaired the General Assembly 's Sportsmen 's Caucus . 
 During the 2008 session , Gibbs sponsored a total of 26 bills as either the lead sponsor or the Senate sponsor of a House bill . Twenty @-@ two of his bills were passed — an average of more than one per week during the legislative session — including : 
 the Colorado Forest Restoration Act , a reauthorization of Gibbs ' 2007 house bill to provide funds for local forest restoration projects through 2012 , cosponsored with Rep. Christine Scanlan ; 
 the Workplace Accommodations for Working Mothers Act , which requires employers to provide accommodations for breastfeeding mothers ; 
 the Firefighter Protection Act , which would grant additional legal protections for firefighters ; 
 a bill clarifying rules regarding sales of gaming machines ; 
 a bill to prohibit soft drinks from being sold at public schools , 
 a bill lowering the blood alcohol limit for boat operators . 
 a bill allowing water boards to issue bonds for fire @-@ mitigation projects . 
 Several of Gibbs bills failed in committee , including legislation to provide $ 10 million in tax incentives for the film industry in Colorado . With Rep. Scanlan , Gibbs was a prominent opponent of several proposals to charge tolls along the I @-@ 70 mountain corridor within his district ; he later cited this as his most significant accomplishment of the session . 
 In response to Gibbs ' efforts to advance understanding of the ongoing bark beetle epidemic , Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter signed an executive order in February 2008 creating the Colorado Forest Health Advisory Council ; Gibbs was named to the 24 @-@ member panel shortly after its creation . Following the legislative session , Gibbs was also named the chairman of an interim legislative committee to study wildfire issues , but was criticized by Republicans for delaying the start of the committee 's work . The following day , Gibbs announced plans for the committee 's first meeting . 
 In July 2008 , Gibbs was a prominent critic of Denver Water 's sudden closure of the Lake Dillon Dam Road for security reasons . Shortly after the road was reopened , Gibbs and Rep. Christine Scanlan announced plans for legislation to prevent future unilateral closures and to encourage cooperation between agencies to share vulnerability assessments and emergency plans

 In the 2009 session of the Colorado General Assembly , Gibbs rose to chair the Senate Transportation Committee and sat on the Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee . 
 Gibbs missed some of the opening ceremonies of the 2009 General Assembly after being called to help fight a wildfire near Boulder , Colorado ; his absence was cited by Gov. Ritter during the governor 's " State of the State " address . With Rep. Christine Scanlan , Gibbs travelled to Washington DC in February and in June to lobby for resources to deal with Colorado 's mountain pine beetle epidemic . 
 Gibbs was the Senate sponsor of a major transportation proposal , introduced by Rep. Joe Rice and backed by Gov. Bill Ritter and other Democratic leaders , to increase transportation funding by $ 250 million per year , primarily for road and bridge repair , by increasing a range of vehicle registration fees . The proposal , labeled " FASTER , " an acronym for Funding Advancement for Surface Transportation and Economic Recovery , stalled in the state senate , but advanced after a compromise was reached to drop a pilot program to charge drivers based on vehicle miles travelled and to allow locally authorized toll <unk> and eventually passed out of the legislature , FASTER was passed without the support of Republicans , who objected to the level of fee increases and called for resources besides fees to be used to support transportation . The increased registration fees drew significant protest from the public when they took effect in July 2009 . 
 Other legislation sponsored by Gibbs included bills to extend Colorado 's habitat stamp program , to create a specialty license plate for skiing and snowboarding , to overhaul regulations on oil and gas drilling operations , and to facilitate local planning and fundraising for fighting wildfires . 
 Gibbs was also viewed as one of the crucial swing votes on a measure to repeal the death penalty in Colorado and use the resulting savings to fund a statewide cold case unit . Although he first voted to remove the death penalty repeal from the legislation , he later voted in support of a version of the bill containing the repeal , which came within one vote of passing the legislature on the final day of the session . 
 In January 2009 , Gibbs was named one of the Western Colorado Conservation Corps ' Legislators of the Year , and in May 2009 , he was the keynote speaker at Summit High School 's graduation .

 In November 2009 , Gibbs announced that , rather than running for re @-@ election to the state senate in fall of 2010 , he would run for the Summit County Commissioner seat being vacated by Bob French . Gibbs 's retirement opened up a seat that Republicans viewed as a pickup opportunity . 
 In 2014 , Gibbs discussed his preference for local politics : “ At the state level , it ’ s much more about whether you are a Republican or a Democrat and winning and losing , rather than making decisions that are good for Colorado . The more dysfunctional things get at the federal and state levels , the more people seem to come together at the local level to accomplish goals that are important to communities . ” 
 In November 2014 , he easily defeated Republican Allen Bacher , winning re @-@ election by over 66 percent of the vote . 
 = St John Passion structure = 
 The structure of the St John Passion ( German : Johannes @-@ Passion ) , BWV 245 , a sacred oratorio by Johann Sebastian Bach , is " carefully designed with a great deal of <unk> @-@ theological intent " . Some main aspects of the structure are shown in tables below . 
 The original Latin title <unk> secundum <unk> translates to " The Passion after John " . Bach 's large choral composition in two parts on German text , written to be performed in a Lutheran service on Good Friday , is based on the Passion , as told in two chapters from the Gospel of John ( John 18 and John 19 ) in the translation by Martin Luther , with two short interpolations from the Gospel of Matthew ( in Version I , one from the Gospel of Matthew and one from the Gospel of Mark ) . During the vespers service , the two parts of the work were performed before and after the sermon . Part I covers the events until Peter 's denial of Jesus , Part II concludes with the burial of Jesus . The Bible text is reflected in contemporary poetry and in chorales that often end a " scene " of the narration , similar to the way a chorale ends most Bach cantatas . An anonymous poet supplied a few texts himself , quoted from other Passion texts and inserted chorales by nine <unk> . Bach led the first performance on 7 April 1724 in Leipzig 's Nikolaikirche . He repeated it several times between 1724 and 1749 , experimenting with different movements and changes to others , which resulted in four versions ( with a fifth one not performed , but representing the standard version ) . The Passion , close to Bach 's heart , has an " immediate dramatic quality " . 
 = = Structure = = 
 = = = Text = = = 
 = = = = Gospel = = = = 
 The gospel account by John narrates the story in five " scenes " . The corresponding movement numbers are given from the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe ( NBA ) . 
 Part I 
 Arrest ( 1 – 5 ) , Kidron Valley ( John 18 : 1 – 11 ) 
 Denial ( 6 – 14 ) , palace of the high priest <unk> ( John 18 : 12 – 27 ) 
 Part II 
 Court hearing with Pontius Pilate ( 15 – 26 ) ( John 18 : 28 – 40 and John 19 : 1 – 22 ) 
 Crucifixion and death ( 27 – 37 ) , <unk> ( John 19 : 23 – 30 ) 
 Burial ( 38 – 40 ) , burial site ( John 19 : 31 – 42 ) 
 Some musicologists regard movement 24 as the conclusion of scene 3 , the aria " <unk> , ihr <unk> <unk> Seelen " which locates the action from the courthouse to Golgotha , the <unk> . Others , including Alfred Dürr regard the scene as ending with the last comment by Pilate . 
 Bach incorporated two short interpolations from the Gospel of Matthew ( in Version I , one from Matthew and one from the Gospel of Mark ) , Matthew 26 : 75 after John 18 : 27 , describing the weeping of Peter , and Matthew 27 : 51 – 52 after John 19 : 30 , describing the tearing of the temple curtain ( in Version I , this was replaced by Mark 15 : 38 ) . The narrator is the Evangelist , a tenor , Jesus and all other male characters are sung by a bass , the people who are often summarily called die <unk> ( the Jews ) are sung by a four @-@ part chorus ( SATB ) in dramatic turba movements . The " immediate , dramatic quality " of the " kind of musical equivalent of the Passion Play " relies on the setting of the interaction between the historical persons ( Jesus , Pilate , Peter ) and the crowd ( " soldiers , priests , and populace " ) .

 At eleven points in the structure , chorales reflect the narration , stanzas from Lutheran hymns . Possibly Bach had an influence on their selection . He set them all in common time for four parts , the instruments playing with the voices . 
 Five chorales conclude a scene ( in movements 5 , 14 , 26 , 37 and 40 ) , a chorale opens Part II ( 15 ) . Five chorales comment within a scene ( 3 , 11 , 17 , 22 , 28 ) . including the central movement of the whole Passion ( 22 ) . One chorale accompanies the bass soloist in an aria ( 32 ) . 
 Most chorale texts were written in the 16th and 17th century , by authors of the Reformation such as Martin Luther , Martin Schalling and Michael Weiße , and by hymn writers including Paul Gerhardt and Johann Heermann . The central chorale is not part of a common hymn . 
 = = = = Contemporary text = = = = 
 On a third level of text , contemporary poetry reflects the biblical narration . It was compiled by an unknown author , who partly used existing text . From the Brockes Passion ( Der für die Sünde der Welt <unk> und <unk> Jesus , aus den IV <unk> , Hamburg , 1712 and 1715 ) by Barthold Heinrich Brockes , he copied for movements 7 , 19 , 20 , 24 , 32 , 34 , a part of 35 and 39 . He found movement 13 in Christian Weise 's Der Grünen Jugend <unk> Gedanken ( Leipzig , 1675 ) and took from Christian Heinrich Postel 's Johannes @-@ Passion ( c . 1700 ) movements 19 ( partly ) , 22 and 30 . 
 = = = Scoring = = = 
 The work is scored for vocal soloists , soprano , alto , tenor and bass , a four part choir SATB , and an orchestra of two flauto traverso ( Ft ) , two oboes ( Ob ) , two oboes da caccia ( Oc ) , two oboes d 'amore ( Oa ) , two violins , viola ( Va ) , and basso continuo . Bach added some instruments in arias for special effects , old @-@ fashioned already at the time , such as <unk> , viola d 'amore and viola da gamba ( Vg ) . Bach did not differentiate the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) , singing the words of Jesus , from the other bass recitatives and arias , nor the evangelist from the tenor arias . 
 = = = Symmetry = = = 
 The work displays a thoughtful symmetry . In the center of the five parts is the court hearing which confronts Jesus , Pilate and the people . In the middle of the hearing , a chorale ( 22 ) interrupts the argument , which talks about prison and freedom . It is surrounded by two choral movements , which not only both ask for the crucifixion of Jesus , but also use the same musical motifs , the second time intensified . Again in symmetry of similar musical material , a preceding turba choir explains the law , while a corresponding movement reminds Pilate of the emperor whose authority is challenged by someone calling himself a king . Preceding this , Jesus is greeted in mockery as the king , corresponding in motif to the later request that Pilate should change the inscription saying he is the king to that he claimed to be king . 
 = = = Versions = = = 
 Bach led the first performance on 7 April 1724 at the Nikolaikirche ( St. Nicholas ) as part of a Vesper service on Good Friday . Part I was performed before the sermon , Part II after the sermon . Bach performed a second version on Good Friday a year later , 30 March 1725 . Other changes date from between 1728 and 1732 ( version 3 ) , and between 1738 and 1748 ( version 4 ) . 
 In version 2 , Bach opened with a chorale fantasia on " O Mensch , <unk> dein Sünde groß " ( O man , bewail thy sins so great ) , the first stanza of a 1525 hymn by Sebald Heyden , a movement which he ultimately used to conclude Part I of his St Matthew Passion , returning to the previous chorus Herr , unser <unk> in later versions of the St John Passion . He used three alternative arias , one of them with a chorale sung by the choir , and replaced the two closing movements , the chorus " <unk> wohl " and the chorale " Ach Herr , laß dein lieb Engelein " with the chorale fantasia " Christe , du Lamm Gottes " ( Christ , you Lamb of God ) , the German Agnus Dei , published in Braunschweig in 1528 . Bach took this movement from his cantata Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn , BWV 23 , which had been an audition piece for the Leipzig post . Before , it had been part of his Weimarer Passion of 1717 . 
 In version 3 , after Bach wrote his St Matthew Passion , he returned the opening chorus Herr , unser <unk> and the final chorus " <unk> wohl " to their first position , but eliminated the Gospel passages after Matthew and the closing chorale . 
 In version 4 , Bach returned to the first version , possibly in 1739 , but revised it thoroughly . He began a new score which covers 12 movements . As Christoph Wolff observes : " The fragmentary revised score constitutes an extensive stylistic overhaul with painstaking improvements to the part @-@ writing and a partial restructuring of the instrumentation ; particular attention was paid to the word @-@ setting in the recitatives and the continuo accompaniment . " In 1749 , Bach performed the St John Passion once more , to become his last performance of a Passion . 
 Wolff writes : " Bach experimented with the St John Passion as he did with no other large @-@ scale composition " , possible by the work 's structure with the Gospel text as its backbone and interspersed features that could be exchanged . Wolff concludes : " the work accompanied Bach right from his first year as Kantor of St Thomas 's to the penultimate year of his life and thus , for that reason alone , how close it must have been to his heart .

 In the following , the movement numbers are those of the NBA , version I , unless otherwise noted . 
 = = = The chorales in detail = = = 
 The first chorale , movement 3 , is inserted after Jesus said to arrest him , but let the disciples go . " O <unk> Lieb , o Lieb ohn alle <unk> " ( O mighty love , O love beyond all measure ) is stanza 7 of Johann Heermann 's 1630 hymn " Herzliebster Jesu , was hast du <unk> " . In personal reflection , the speaker sees the contrast of his pleasure in the world and the suffering of Jesus , ending in a short " Und du <unk> <unk> " ( And thou must suffer ) . 
 The second chorale , movement 5 , ends the first scene ( of the arrest ) , after Jesus remarks that he has to be obedient . " Dein Will <unk> , Herr Gott , <unk> " ( Thy will be done , Lord God , alike ) is stanza 4 of Luther 's 1539 hymn " Vater unser im <unk> , a paraphrase of the Lord 's Prayer . 
 The third chorale , movement 11 , is inserted after Jesus asks the one who beat him for justification . Two stanzas from Paul Gerhardt 's 1647 hymn " O Welt , <unk> hier dein Leben " comment the scene , stanza 3 , " Wer hat dich so <unk> " ( Who hath thee now so stricken ) , and stanza 4 , " Ich , ich und meine Sünden " ( I , I and my transgressions ) , highlighting the personal responsibility of the speaking sinner for the suffering of Jesus . 
 The fourth chorale , movement 14 , ends the second scene ( of the arrest ) and Part I. After the denial of Peter , " Petrus , der nicht <unk> zurück " ( Peter , when he fails to think ) summarizes the scene in stanza 10 of Paul Stockmann 's 1633 hymn " Jesu Leiden , Pein und Tod " . 
 The fifth chorale , movement 15 , opens Part II and the third scene ( of the court hearing ) . " Christus , der uns <unk> macht " ( Christ , who hath us blessed made ) , stanza 1 of Michael Weiße 's 1531 hymn , summarizes what Jesus has to endure although innocent ( " made captive , ... falsely indicted , and mocked and scorned and <unk> " ) . 
 The sixth chorale , movement 17 , comments in two more stanzas from " Herzliebster Jesu " ( 3 ) , after Jesus addressed the different kind of his kingdom . Stanza 8 , " Ach großer König , groß zu allen Zeiten " ( Ah King so mighty , mighty in all ages ) reflects the kingdom and the need for thanksgiving , stanza 9 the inability to grasp it , " Ich <unk> mit meinen Sinnen nicht <unk> " ( I cannot with my reason ever fathom ) . 
 The seventh chorale , movement 22 , is the central movement of the whole Passion , which interrupts the conversation of Pilate and the crowd by a general statement of the importance of the passion for salvation : " Durch dein Gefängnis , Gottes Sohn , ist uns die Freiheit kommen " ( Through this thy prison , Son of God , must come to us our freedom ) is not part of a known hymn , but the text of an aria from a St John Passion by Postel from c . 1700 . 
 The seventh chorale , movement 26 , ends the scene of the court hearing , after Pilate refuses to change the inscription . " In meines Herzens <unk> " ( Within my heart 's foundation ) is stanza 3 of Valerius Herberger 's 1613 hymn " Valet will ich dir geben " . 
 The eighth chorale , movement 28 , is related to Jesus telling his mother and John to take care of each other . " Er nahm alles wohl in <unk> " ( He of all did well take heed ) is stanza 20 of Stockmann 's hymn ( 14 ) . 
 The ninth chorale , movement 32 , is part of the bass aria which follows immediately after the report of the death of Jesus . " Jesu , der du <unk> tot , <unk> nun ohn ' Ende " ( Jesus , thou who suffered death , <unk> now forever ) is the final stanza of Stockmann 's hymn ( 14 ) . 
 The tenth chorale , movement 37 , ends the scene of the crucifixion . " O <unk> , Christ , Gottes Sohn " ( O help , Christ , O Son of God ) is stanza 8 of Weiße 's hymn ( 15 ) . 
 The eleventh chorale , movement 40 , ends the Passion . " Ach Herr , laß dein lieb Engelein " ( Ah Lord , let thine own angels dear ) is stanza 3 of Martin Schalling 's 1569 hymn " Herzlich lieb hab ich dich , o Herr " .

 The following tables give an overview of all versions of the Passion , first performed in 1724 . Two versions of movement numbers are given , first that of the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe ( NBA ) , then that of the older Bach @-@ Werke @-@ Verzeichnis ( BWV ) . Voices appear in one of three columns , depending on the text source , Bible , contemporary poetic reflection , and chorale . The instrumentation is added , using abbreviations for instruments , followed by key and time signature , and the NBA number of a corresponding movement within the work 's symmetry . 
 = = = = Version I = = = = 
 There are no extant Flute parts for this version , so the movements that normally require them have Violins doubling on them . This was performed in 1724 . The Bach Compendium lists it as BC D 2a

 = = = = Version II = = = = 
 For this version ( of 1725 ) , in addition to the Flute parts ( which were first used in late 1724 ( after 1 . Sunday after Trinity ) , Bach revised heavily both text and music . He added five movements from his Weimarer Passion , with three texts now thought to be by Christoph Birkmann . This is listed as BC 2b . 
 = = = = Part I = = = = 
 = = = = Part II = = = = 
 = = = = Version III = = = = 
 In this version , Bach reverted to the original layout ( thus discarding the previous revisions and additions ) . However , he decided to compose a true St. John Passion , and thus eliminated the material inserted from the Gospel of Matthew . Now <unk> ends in Measure 31 and Movement 33 is eliminated altogether ( replaced by a lost Sinfonia ) . He also dispensed with the Lute and the Viola d 'amore , replacing them with an Organ and Violini con sordino . It was possibly performed in 1728 and definitely in 1732 . This is listed as BC D 2c .

 Essentially a reworking of the 1724 1st Version , this version is the most detail @-@ oriented <unk> of the work . On 17 March 1739 , while still working on this revision , Bach was informed that the performance of the Passion setting could not go ahead without official permission , thus ( most likely ) effectively halting any plans for that year . In response , Bach performed the Brockes @-@ Passion of his friend , Georg Philipp Telemann ( <unk> 5 : 1 ) . However , though he was stopped at M. 42 of Movement 10 , he continued to work on his revision , as borne out by the <unk> 's score and parts . It is listed as BC D 2e .

 Essentially a re @-@ production of Version I with a few alterations ( text changes in Movements 9 , 19 & 20 , instrumentation reflection of Version III ) . It was performed in 1749 and ( most likely ) repeated in 1750 . It also represents ( outside of the St. Matthew Passion ) the largest instrumental ensemble used ( calling for 3 1st Violins ) , and ( for the first time in his work ) calls for a <unk> ( used in all choral parts , as well as instrumental ritornellos ) . It is listed as BC D 2d .

 = Operation Pamphlet = 
 Operation Pamphlet , also called Convoy Pamphlet , was a convoy operation of World War II conducted during January and February 1943 to transport the Australian Army 's 9th Division home from Egypt . The convoy involved five transports , which were protected from Japanese warships during their trip across the Indian Ocean and along the Australian coastline by several Allied naval task forces . The 9th Division boarded the ships during late January 1943 , and the convoy operation began on 4 February . No contact was made between Allied and Japanese ships , and the 9th Division arrived in Australian ports during late February with no losses from enemy action . 
 The operation was initiated after the British and United States governments agreed to the Australian Government 's request that the 9th Division be transferred to Australia , thereby ending the Second Australian Imperial Force 's role in the North African Campaign . The division had seen extensive combat in North Africa , but was needed to bolster the forces available for planned offensive operations in the Pacific . After its return to Australia , the 9th Division was retrained for jungle warfare and made an important contribution to operations conducted in New Guinea during late 1943 . 
 = = Background = = 
 During 1940 and 1941 , three infantry divisions and other units assigned to I Corps of the Second Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) were transported to the Middle East , where they took part in several campaigns against German , Italian and French forces . Following the outbreak of the Pacific War , the corps headquarters and the 6th and 7th Divisions were returned to Australia in early 1942 to bolster the country 's defences ; the movement of these troops was designated Operation <unk> . The Australian Government agreed to British and US requests to temporarily retain the 9th Division in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of additional United States Army units to Australia and Britain 's support for a proposal to expand the Royal Australian Air Force to 73 squadrons . That year , the 9th Division played an important role in the First Battle of El Alamein during July 1942 and the Second Battle of El Alamein between 23 October and 4 November . The division suffered many casualties during the latter engagement , and did not take part in the pursuit of the retreating Axis forces . 
 Several factors influenced the decision made by the Australian Government in October 1942 to recall the 9th Division to Australia . Firstly , the Government and the commander of the Australian Military Forces , General Thomas Blamey , wanted to relieve the 6th and 7th Divisions from combat in the New Guinea Campaign and Blamey considered the 9th Division to be better prepared for this responsibility than his militia forces or US Army units . Secondly , the commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area , General Douglas MacArthur , had been pressing the US and Australian Governments for reinforcements to conduct offensive operations against Japanese positions . Other factors influencing the decision were a desire to concentrate the Australian Army in a single theatre , the increasing difficulty in finding replacements for the 9th Division 's casualties given the Army 's manpower shortages , the political difficulties associated with implementing reforms to permit militia units to serve outside Australian territory , and concerns that a prolonged absence from Australia would affect morale among the 9th Division 's soldiers . 
 On 17 October 1942 , Australian Prime Minister John Curtin cabled British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to request that the 9th Division be returned to Australia . In the cable Curtin stated that , owing to Australia 's manpower shortage and the demands of the war in the Pacific , it was no longer possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain the division in the Middle East . The British Government initially resisted this request on the grounds that the 9th Division was required for the upcoming offensive at El Alamein . On 29 October ( six days into the battle ) Curtin again cabled Churchill , stating that Australia needed the division in the Pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations . On 1 November , US President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to Curtin proposing to send an additional army division to Australia if the Australian Government agreed to retain the 9th Division in the Middle East . Curtin , acting on the advice of MacArthur , responded to Roosevelt on 16 November rejecting this suggestion , and again requested that the 9th Division be returned . 
 On 21 November , the commander of the 9th Division , Major General Leslie Morshead , was informed by General Harold Alexander , the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Middle East Command , that a decision had been made to return the division to Australia . Churchill subsequently told the Australian Government on 2 December that while he was prepared to recommend to Roosevelt that the 9th Division be returned , the resultant diversion of shipping would reduce the size of the build @-@ up of United States military personnel in Britain and North Africa by 30 @,@ 000 men . In the same cable , Churchill also stated that due to a shortage of shipping the 9th Division 's heavy equipment would need to remain in the Middle East . On 3 December Roosevelt again wrote to Curtin to suggest that the 9th Division remain in the Middle East until the final defeat of the Axis forces in North Africa . Roosevelt also informed Curtin that the United States Army 's 25th Infantry Division would be transferred to Australia during December . Following these messages the Government sought advice from Blamey and MacArthur on whether it was necessary for the 9th Division to return with its heavy equipment , and was informed that the necessary supplies could be sourced from American resources once the unit arrived in Australia . 
 Curtin replied to Churchill and Roosevelt on 8 December , and again stressed the need to return the 9th Division to Australia as soon as possible to make good the Army 's losses to tropical diseases and prepare for future offensives in the Pacific . In his message he agreed to leave the division 's heavy equipment in the Middle East , and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re @-@ enter combat in the South West Pacific . No further debate took place , and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The 9th Division 's role in the Second Battle of El Alamein ended on 5 November 1942 . From 30 November the division travelled to Palestine by road , and all its units arrived there by 9 December . After settling into camps located between Gaza and Qastina , the 9th Division undertook a period of rebuilding and training , and many soldiers were granted leave . On 22 December , a formal parade involving the entire division was conducted at Gaza Airport . 
 Preparations to return the 9th Division to Australia began in late December 1942 . On 26 December , all of the AIF unit commanding officers in the Middle East were informed that their commands were to return to Australia ; the movement was code @-@ named " <unk> " . Tight security was instituted for this operation , and more junior personnel who needed to be informed of the move were told that their units were being transferred to Egypt . While many members of the AIF initially believed that they would take part in further fighting in the Mediterranean , as preparations continued it became obvious that the units were about to undertake a long sea voyage . The 9th Division 's artillery , tanks and other heavy equipment were transferred to ordnance depots during early January 1943 , and on the 16th of that month the division began moving to the Suez Canal area , from where it was to embark . The movement of the 9th Division took place in groups , each of which spent one or two days at a transit camp at <unk> where all vehicles were handed to British authorities . 
 The Royal Navy also made preparations for the movement of the 9th Division back to Australia in late 1942 . Four large troop ships were allocated to the task , and the British Chiefs of Staff Committee initially proposed to Churchill that they sail across the Indian Ocean without a protective escort . However , as the eastern Indian Ocean was within range of Japanese warships based at Singapore this was judged to be unacceptably risky , especially as it was not likely that the movement of so many soldiers could be kept secret . Moreover , transporting the division without an escort would have violated the long @-@ standing policy of assigning at least one capital ship to protect troop convoys in this region , and would not have been accepted by the Australian government . In November , the Chiefs of Staff Committee decided to allocate an escort to the convoy , but did not specify what it should comprise . 
 = = Voyage = = 
 = = = Indian Ocean = = = 
 The AIF began embarking on the troop ships on 24 January 1943 . The ships assigned to carry the troops home were the converted ocean liners Aquitania , Île de France , Nieuw Amsterdam and Queen Mary . The armed merchant cruiser HMS Queen of Bermuda provided escort , and also embarked 1 @,@ 731 Australian soldiers . As the Suez Canal ports were too small for the four troop ships to load simultaneously , the embarkation process was staged and the convoy 's five vessels sailed separately through the northern Red Sea and rendezvoused near Massawa in Eritrea . British destroyers HMS Pakenham , Petard , Derwent and Hero and the Greek destroyer <unk> Olga were transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet to guard the troop ships from attack by Japanese submarines as they passed through the Red Sea . 
 Queen Mary was the first ship to complete loading , and left Port Tewfik on 25 January . She anchored at Massawa three days later , and the soldiers on board endured very hot conditions until she resumed her journey . Aquitania was next to load , and embarked the entire 20th Brigade between 25 and 30 January . Île de France completed loading and departed Egypt on 28 January , and Nieuw Amsterdam and Queen of Bermuda sailed together on 1 February . Overall , 30 @,@ 985 Australians were embarked on Queen of Bermuda and the converted liners ; Aquitania carried 6 @,@ 953 , Île de France 6 @,@ 531 , Nieuw Amsterdam had 9 @,@ 241 on board and 9 @,@ 995 sailed on Queen Mary . A total of 622 AIF personnel remained in the Middle East after the five ships departed Egypt , but this figure was steadily reduced to below 20 by March 1943 . 
 The five ships of the convoy rendezvoused off Perim on the morning of 4 February , and passed Aden later that day . The destroyers left the convoy as it passed Cape Guardafui , and were replaced by the heavy cruiser HMS Devonshire and light cruiser HMS Gambia which were to serve as ocean escorts . Captain James Bisset , commander of the Queen Mary , served as the convoy commodore . The four large converted liners sailed in line abreast formation and Queen of Bermuda 's position varied based on the time of day and the situation . The convoy maintained a speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ) ; while the liners typically sailed at much higher speeds during their independent voyages , they were constrained by the maximum which Queen of Bermuda could maintain . 
 After entering the Indian Ocean , the convoy sailed south @-@ east . The ships manoeuvred together in a zigzag course ; avoiding collisions during the frequent turns placed heavy demands on the watch @-@ keeping officers , who found their shifts exhausting . The troops endured very uncomfortable conditions on the crowded troop ships , but morale was high . They entertained themselves with sports , sun baking and gambling . The 9th Division 's officers enjoyed somewhat better conditions , which frustrated some of the other ranks . The convoy arrived at Addu Atoll on the evening of 9 February , and anchored there to refuel and take on supplies . This atoll served as a secret supply base for Allied ships in the Indian Ocean , and the Australian soldiers were not told where they were while the refuelling took place . The ships sailed again on the afternoon of 10 February . 
 A strong escort force was provided to guard the convoy as it travelled through the eastern Indian Ocean . For this , most dangerous , stage of the journey Force " A " of the British Eastern Fleet sailed near the troop ships . The force comprised the battleships HMS Warspite , Resolution and Revenge , as well as the light cruiser HMS Mauritius and six destroyers . The Australian soldiers were pleased to see so many warships sailing near their ships on 10 February , though Force A later patrolled over the horizon from the convoy . As the convoy neared the Western Australian port of Fremantle , its escort was reinforced by the Dutch cruisers HNLMS Jacob van Heemskerck and Tromp , as well as the destroyers HNLMS Tjerk Hiddes and Van Galen . 
 The ships arrived at Fremantle on 18 February . Nieuw Amsterdam and Queen of Bermuda berthed in Fremantle Harbour , and the other three troop ships dropped anchor at Gage Roads . The Western Australian members of the 9th Division were disembarked , and the ships loaded supplies and mail . As Queen of Bermuda left the convoy at Fremantle , her remaining 517 passengers were transferred to Nieuw Amsterdam . This resulted in considerable overcrowding on board the liner for the remainder of her voyage . 
 = = = Australian waters = = = 
 The Australian Government was concerned about the safety of the troop ships in Australian waters . At a meeting held on 17 February , the Advisory War Council considered recommending that the soldiers be moved to the east coast by rail . It decided against this option after being informed that , due to the limited capacity of the Trans @-@ Australian Railway , it would take several months to move the 30 @,@ 000 personnel . Instead , the council recommended that the convoy continue but be given " the maximum protection possible " . Due to the presence of Japanese submarines off the Australian coast , tight security measures were instituted after the convoy arrived at Fremantle ; civilian communications between Western Australia and the east coast were cut off for several days , and Curtin asked the media to not report the movement of the 9th Division . As part of a confidential briefing on 24 February , Curtin told journalists that he had not slept well for three weeks due to concerns for the safety of the convoy . 
 When the convoy sailed from Fremantle on 20 February it was escorted by the Australian light cruiser HMAS Adelaide , as well as Jacob van Heemskerck and Tjerk Hiddes . It met the ships of Task Group 44 @.@ 3 on 24 February in the Great Australian Bight . This force comprised the heavy cruiser HMAS Australia and American destroyers USS Bagley , Helm and Henley , and had been dispatched from Sydney on 17 February to escort the troop ships . Adelaide and the Dutch warships left the convoy shortly afterwards to escort Nieuw Amsterdam into Melbourne ; the liner docked there on the afternoon of 25 February . Task Group 44 @.@ 3 escorted the remaining ships to Sydney , passing south of Tasmania . The escort was strengthened by Jacob van Heemskerck and the French destroyer <unk> en route . The three converted liners arrived at Sydney on 27 February 1943 , completing Operation Pamphlet without loss . Despite the official secrecy concerning the convoy , large crowds assembled on vantage points around Sydney Harbour to watch the ships arrive . Queen Mary anchored off Bradleys Head and the other two liners berthed at Woolloomooloo . Curtin officially announced that the 9th Division had returned to Australia in a speech delivered to the House of Representatives on 23 March . 
 After disembarking , all members of the 9th Division were given three weeks leave . The men were then assembled in their home state capital and took part in a welcome home march ; these marches were conducted to acknowledge the division 's service in the Middle East and advertise a war loan drive . Following the marches the division re @-@ assembled at training camps on the Atherton Tableland in far North Queensland where it was to be retrained for jungle warfare . The 9th Division next saw action against Japanese forces during the Salamaua – Lae campaign in September 1943 ; had the division not returned from the Middle East , at least part of this task would have fallen to less experienced Militia units .

 = 1982 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship Game = 
 The 1982 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship Game took place on March 29 , 1982 between the North Carolina Tar Heels and Georgetown Hoyas at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans , Louisiana . The match @-@ up was the final one of the forty @-@ fourth consecutive NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship single @-@ elimination tournament — commonly referred to as the NCAA Tournament — organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) and is used to crown a national champion for men 's basketball at the Division I level . 
 Head coach John Thompson and the Georgetown Hoyas entered the game ranked eighth in the AP Poll , with an overall record of 28 – 6 . The Hoyas were led by First – team All @-@ American Eric Floyd and seven @-@ foot freshman Patrick Ewing . In the midst of a fifteen @-@ game winning streak , the North Carolina Tar Heels entered the National Championship game with a record of 31 – 2 after defeating the Houston Cougars in the national semifinal . The Dean Smith led North Carolina Tar Heels were anchored by Junior and First – team All @-@ American James Worthy . 
 The game was televised by CBS across the United States , which attracted over 17 million viewers . Georgetown jumped out to an early 12 – 10 lead after twelve minutes of play , with eight of North Carolina 's points coming from goaltending infractions by Ewing . The Hoyas entered halftime ahead by a single point , 32 – 31 . The teams traded the lead multiple times closing minutes of the second half . Following a turnover by Matt Doherty , Georgetown took the lead 62 – 61 courtesy of a jump shot from Floyd . During the ensuing possession , North Carolina Freshman Michael Jordan hit a go @-@ ahead basket with fifteen seconds remaining to give North Carolina a one @-@ point advantage . 
 The Tar Heels won their second NCAA Men 's Basketball National Championship , with their first coming in 1957 . Worthy was named the NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player for his efforts throughout the tournament . After losing in his first three national title game appearances – something many had openly criticized him over – coach Smith won his first National Championship as a head coach . Ewing helped lead the Hoyas back to the national title game in 1984 and 1985 , where they won it all in 1984 . Both talented Freshman , Ewing and Jordan , went on to become National Players of the Year before each left college to play professional basketball .

 John Thompson was in the midst of his tenth season as head coach of the Georgetown Hoyas as the team entered the National Championship game . Before the season , Thompson made headlines when he signed top recruit , Patrick Ewing over several other top name schools , along with Tony Jones , Ralph Dalton , <unk> Smith , and Bill Martin . Georgetown was named by some voters as the number one team in the nation in the preseason polls due to its highly touted recruiting class . The Hoyas ' starting line up was : Eric Smith , Eric Floyd , and Fred Brown as guards , Mike Hancock in the forward position , and Ewing at center . 
 The Georgetown Hoyas participated in the Great Alaska Shootout to start the 1981 – 82 season . The Hoyas lost their opening game to Southwestern Louisiana 70 – 61 after playing a sloppy game . After winning the following game against , the Hoyas lost to Ohio State by one point in their final game of the tournament . Georgetown then began a thirteen @-@ game win streak , which was followed by losing three straight to three conference opponents . The Hoyas then finished the regular season with nine more wins and one loss , which was good enough to finish second in the Big East regular season standings . The Hoyas won their first two games of the Big East Tournament by a collective margin of 29 points and advanced to the championship game against the Villanova Wildcats . The two teams were tied at halftime , but at halftime the Hoyas elected to use a man to man defense over a zone . This proved effective as they were able to force turnovers and shoot well from the field , which led them to win the game 72 – 54 . The Georgetown Hoyas won the Big East Tournament and also , a bid to the NCAA Tournament . 
 In the first round of the NCAA Tournament , Georgetown faced Wyoming and won 51 – 43 . The Hoyas then beat the Fresno State Bulldogs by eighteen , after leading by five at halftime , to advance to the regional finals . Georgetown faced off against Oregon State in the regional final . In the game , the Hoyas shot very well from the field , setting the tournament record for field goal percentage in a game , 77 @.@ 4 % , en route to the 69 – 45 victory . In the national semifinal against Louisville , both teams shot very poorly . The two teams traded the lead several times throughout the first half , but after three minutes into the second half , Georgetown gained the lead and never relinquished it . The Hoyas used defense to maintain their lead and set the pace of the game , which they won 50 – 46 .

 The North Carolina Tar Heels were coached by Dean Smith , who was in his twenty – first season as head coach of the Tar Heels . This was Smith 's fourth National Championship game appearance as the coach of North Carolina , after losing in 1968 , 1977 , and 1981 . Coach Smith entered the 1981 regular season with what he called the " best class he ever had " to that point in his career with : Buzz Peterson , Warren Martin , Michael Jordan , Lynwood Robinson , and John Brownlee . His North Carolina team was named by many as the preseason number one and the favorite to win the national title . North Carolina 's starting line up consisted of Jimmy Black and Jordan at the guard positions , Matt Doherty and James Worthy in at forward , and Sam Perkins as starting center . 
 North Carolina opened their 1981 – 82 campaign with a win against Kansas at a neutral site in Charlotte , North Carolina . After winning five more games , the Tar Heels entered the Cable Car Classic . Behind Perkins ' 23 points , the Tar Heels managed to win the game , despite being taken to overtime . North Carolina advanced to the tournament final where the defeated Santa Clara . Wake Forest defeated North Carolina , who was playing without Perkins due to illness , to hand them their first loss of the season . The Tar Heels won three more games before losing to Virginia , where they trailed the whole game . North Carolina won the remaining games of its regular season . The team won the ACC Tournament by narrowly defeating Virginia in tournament 's championship game , 47 – 45 . 
 North Carolina edged James Madison 52 – 50 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament . The Tar Heels beat Alabama in the succeeding round to advance to the regional final against Villanova . North Carolina advanced to the Final Four with a 70 – 60 over Villanova as each starter scored over ten points . In the national semifinal , North Carolina was pitted against Houston . The Tar Heels opened the game with a 14 – 0 run . Houston overcame the deficit and tied the game at 29 just a few minutes before the half . Coming out of halftime , North Carolina went on a 7 – 2 run and eventually won the game 68 – 63 after stalling for a significant period of time .

 In the days before the game was to be played there was significant coverage given to the two head coaches Smith and Thompson . The two had both served as coaches on the 1976 United States men 's Olympic basketball team for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal , Canada . The two coaches first met in Washington D.C. while trying to recruit players from the same high school . Thompson was quoted saying that coach Smith " knows our philosophy and I know his philosophy . " Smith talked of Thompson saying he was a personal friend of his and that he would maintain contact with him whether or not Thompson was still coaching . 
 The relationship between Georgetown 's Floyd and North Carolina 's Worthy also drew some attention from the media . The two players grew up in Gastonia , North Carolina together , where they went to the same church and competed in high school against each other . Worthy commented that his family lives around two to three miles away from Floyd 's . It was noted that the two would likely not interact much while playing as they did not play the same position . 
 Both coaches told the media that they believed their respective teams should play far better than they did in the National semifinal games if they wanted to win the upcoming game . Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown 's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field . In addition , Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor in the game because his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown 's opponents . Ken <unk> of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high @-@ percentage shots .

 The game began with a tip – off between Georgetown 's Patrick Ewing and North Carolina 's Sam Perkins , which was won by Georgetown . Ewing made the first shot of the game from the baseline . On defense , Ewing was called for goaltending four times to give North Carolina their first eight points . Georgetown coach John Thompson ordered Ewing to " make his presence known " on defense and to not worry about goaltending calls when attempting to block shots . North Carolina did not physically make a shot until 8 : 08 had passed , at which point the score was 12 – 10 in favor of Georgetown . Eric Floyd proceeded to score four consecutive baskets for the Hoyas , while Worthy made six shots for the Tar Heels to tie the score at 22 – 22 . The score at halftime was 32 – 31 in favor of the Hoyas , with ten of North Carolina 's points coming off five goaltending calls on Ewing . 
 The teams traded baskets for the majority of the second half , with the largest advantage being four points by Georgetown with over twelve minutes to go in the game . After five more minutes of game play , North Carolina managed to cut the lead to two , 56 – 54 . The Tar Heels then obtained a single point lead with 5 : 50 to play and set up in their four corners offense , \ to run out the game clock . The Tar Heels were quickly fouled and Jimmy Black converted two free throws , while Fred Brown made two his own on the other end to bring the score to 59 – 58 in favor of North Carolina . With three and a half minutes left in the contest , Michael Jordan drove to the basket and made a shot off of the backboard to increase the Tar Heels ' lead to three , 61 – 58 . On Georgetown 's following possession , Ewing made a jump shot to bring his team within one . North Carolina again set up in the four corners . While making an attempt to steal the ball from Matt Doherty , the Hoyas ' Eric Smith was called for a foul . This sent Doherty to the line for a one @-@ and @-@ one , which he missed and Ewing got the rebound . Smith then hit a twelve @-@ foot jump shot with 57 seconds left to go to give Georgetown the lead , 62 – 61 . Then , Jordan received a pass from Black and connected on a shot with fifteen seconds remaining in the game to give North Carolina a one point lead . On the Hoyas ' ensuing possession , Fred Brown passed the ball away to Worthy , who proceeded to run out some of the clock before being fouled . Because the Hoyas were in the double bonus , Worthy received two free throw attempts , both of which he missed . Floyd got the rebound and attempted a last second shot that also missed .

 North Carolina 's James Worthy was named the NCAA Tournament 's Most Outstanding Player for his performance during the course of the tournament . Along with that honor , Worthy and Eric Floyd were both named Consensus First – team All @-@ Americans for the 1981 – 82 season , while Tar Heel Sam Perkins was a Consensus Second – team All @-@ American . Despite losing the game , John Thompson was given the United States Basketball Writers Association 's Coach of the Year . 
 In the days leading up to the National Championship game , North Carolina head coach Dean Smith was a focal point of the media over his record in national championship games . Smith had coached the North Carolina Tar Heels to six Final Fours and three national title games before the 1981 – 82 season , all of which resulted in the Tar Heels failing to win the tournament . Due to these losses , Smith had earned a reputation for not being able to win the " big game . " When coach Smith won the National Championship game against Georgetown , he silenced those who had criticized him before the game . Before retiring , coach Smith led the Tar Heels to one more national title victory in 1993 . 
 The Georgetown Hoyas returned the National Championship game in 1984 , where they faced off against the Houston Cougars and won 84 – 75 . It was the first NCAA Men 's Basketball National Championship that Georgetown had won , along with the first that Thompson had won as head coach . The following year , they again made it back to the national title game . This time , however , they lost to the number eight seeded Villanova Wildcats . 
 The game featured two future National Players of the Year in Michael Jordan and Ewing . Sporting News named Jordan Player of the Year for the 1982 – 83 season . The following year , Jordan was the consensus National Player of the Year for the 1983 – 84 season , winning each of the player of the year awards that were given out . Ewing won four National Player of the Year awards for his efforts during the 1984 – 85 season . In addition , Worthy , Ewing , and Jordan were all enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame after illustrious professional careers , in 2003 , 2008 , and 2009 , respectively . 
 = Shield nickel = 
 The Shield nickel was the first United States five @-@ cent piece to be made out of copper @-@ nickel , the same alloy of which American nickels are struck today . Designed by James B. Longacre , the coin was issued from 1866 until 1883 , when it was replaced by the Liberty Head nickel . The coin takes its name from the motif on its obverse , and was the first five @-@ cent coin referred to as a " nickel " — silver pieces of that denomination had been known as half dimes . 
 Silver half dimes had been struck from the early days of the United States Mint in the late 18th century . Those disappeared from circulation , along with most other coins , in the economic turmoil of the Civil War . In 1864 , the Mint successfully introduced low @-@ denomination coins , whose intrinsic worth did not approach their face value . Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel — a metal in which he had significant financial interests . When the Mint proposed a copper @-@ nickel five @-@ cent piece , Congress required that the coin be heavier than the Mint had suggested , allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government . 
 Longacre 's design was based on his two @-@ cent pieces , and symbolizes the strength of a unified America . The nickel proved difficult to strike and the reverse , or tails , design was modified in 1867 . Even so , production difficulties continued , causing many minor varieties which are collected today . Minting of the Shield nickel for circulation was suspended in 1876 for a period of over two years due to a glut of low @-@ denomination coinage and it was struck in only small quantities until 1882 . The following year , the coin was replaced by Charles E. Barber 's Liberty head design .

 Five @-@ cent pieces had been struck by the United States Mint since 1792 . They were the first coins struck by Mint authorities . These half dimes ( originally spelled " half dismes " ) , were struck in silver . The alloy used was originally .892 silver with the remainder copper ; in 1837 the silver portion was increased to .900 . 
 The Civil War caused most American coins to vanish from circulation , with the gap filled by such means as merchant tokens , encased postage stamps , and United States fractional currency , issued in denomination as low as three cents . Although specie ( gold or silver coins ) was hoarded or exported , the copper @-@ nickel cent , then the only base metal denomination being struck , also vanished . In 1864 , Congress began the process of restoring coins to circulation by abolishing the three @-@ cent note and authorizing bronze cents and two @-@ cent pieces , with low intrinsic values , to be struck . These new coins initially proved popular , though the two @-@ cent piece soon faded from circulation . On March 3 , 1865 , Congress passed legislation authorizing the Mint to strike three @-@ cent pieces of 75 % copper and 25 % nickel . 
 In 1864 , Congress had authorized a third series of fractional currency notes . The five @-@ cent note was to bear a portrait of " Clark " , but Congress was appalled when the issue came out not bearing a portrait of William Clark , the explorer , but Spencer M. Clark , head of the Currency Bureau . According to numismatic historian Walter Breen , Congress 's " immediate infuriated response was to pass a law retiring the 5 ¢ denomination , and another to forbid portrayal of any living person on federal coins or currency . " Clark only kept his job because of the personal intervention of Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase . 
 Mint Director James Pollock had been opposed to striking coins containing nickel but in view of the initial success of the copper @-@ nickel three @-@ cent piece , he became an advocate of striking five @-@ cent pieces in the same metal . In his 1865 report Pollock wrote , " From this nickel alloy , a coin for the denomination of five cents , and which would be a popular substitute for the five cent note , could easily be made ... [ The five cent coin should be struck in base metal ] only until the resumption of specie payments ... in time of peace ... coins of inferior alloy should not be permitted to take the place permanently of silver in the coinage of pieces above the denomination of three cents . " 
 Industrialist Joseph Wharton had a near @-@ monopoly on the mining of nickel in the United States and sought to promote its use in coinage . He was also highly influential in Congress . His friends there , though they had failed to obtain the metal 's use for the two @-@ cent piece , had been more successful with the three @-@ cent coin . Pollock prepared a bill authorizing a five @-@ cent coin of the same alloy as the three @-@ cent piece and a total weight not to exceed 60 grains ( 3 @.@ 9 g ) . At the committee stage in the House of Representatives , the weight was amended to 77 @.@ 19 grains ( 5 @.@ 00 g ) , ostensibly to make the weight equal to five grams in the metric system but more likely so that Wharton could sell more nickel . This made the new coin heavy in comparison to the three @-@ cent copper @-@ nickel coin . The bill passed without debate on May 16 , 1866 . The new copper @-@ nickel coin was legal tender for up to one dollar , and would be paid out by the Treasury in exchange for coin of the United States , excluding the half cent , cent and two @-@ cent . It was redeemable in lots of $ 100 for banknotes . Fractional currency in denominations of less than ten cents was withdrawn . 
 = = Design and production = = 
 Since coinage was to begin immediately , it was necessary for the Mint 's chief engraver , James B. Longacre to prepare a design as quickly as possible . With the five cent authorization bill pending in Congress , Longacre had produced patterns as early as late 1865 . Longacre produced pattern coins , one with a shield similar to the design he had prepared for the two @-@ cent piece . Longacre altered the two @-@ cent design by shifting the location of the two arrows in the design , removed the scroll on which " In God We Trust " had been inscribed ( the first time that motto had appeared on a U.S. coin ) , and added a cross , apparently intending a <unk> to the top of the shield . Another pattern depicted Washington , while another showed the recently assassinated president , Abraham Lincoln . Reverse designs proposed by Longacre included one with a number 5 within a circle of thirteen stars , each separated from the next by rays . Another reverse design featured the numeral within a wreath . Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch , acting on Pollock 's recommendation , selected the shield design for the obverse , or " heads " side , and the stars and rays design for the reverse . Pollock did not show McCulloch the Lincoln design , believing it would not be well received in the South . 
 According to numismatic author Q. David Bowers , Longacre 's obverse design is " one of the most patriotic motifs in American coinage " . Based on the coat of arms from the Great Seal of the United States of America , Longacre 's design focused on the shield , or escutcheon as a defensive weapon , symbolizing strength and self @-@ protection through unity . The upper part of the shield , or " chief " , symbolizes Congress , while the 13 vertical stripes , or " paleways " symbolize the states ; consequently the entire escutcheon symbolizes the strength of the federal government through the unity of the states . The crossed arrows , whose ends are visible near the bottom of the shield , symbolize nonaggression , but imply readiness against attack . The laurel branches , taken from Greek tradition , symbolize victory . In heraldic engraving , vertical lines represent red , clear areas white and horizontal lines blue , thus the escutcheon is colored red , white and blue and is meant to evoke the American flag . Bowers does not consider the reverse design an artistic work , but one which is purely mechanical , obtained by punching characters and devices into a steel hub . 
 The new coins proved difficult to produce ; due to the hardness of the planchet , the coins were not of high quality and the life of the striking dies was brief . The design of the coins was widely criticized , with Wharton describing the shield design as suggesting " a tombstone surmounted by a cross and overhung by weeping willows . " The American Journal of Numismatics described it as " the ugliest of all known coins " . More seriously , the reverse design reminded many of the " stars and bars " motif of the defeated Confederate States . The rays were eliminated from the design in early 1867 , in the hopes of eliminating some of the production problems . The transition to the new design was to occur on February 1 , 1867 , but it is likely the mint used up the remaining dies with the old design in the interest of economy . The design change created confusion among the population , with many people assuming one design or the other was a counterfeit , and the Mint considered abandoning the shield design entirely . | Seeking alternatives to the difficult @-@ to @-@ work copper @-@ nickel alloy , in June 1867 Longacre proposed that the five @-@ cent piece be struck in aluminum . The new Mint director , Henry Linderman , objected to the proposal , stating that the price and supply of aluminum were as yet uncertain , and that the metal was too expensive to use in a minor coin . Numismatic historian Don Taxay , in his history of the United States Mint and its coins , noted that Linderman had proposed legislation increasing the proportion of nickel in the alloy to a third despite having earlier opposed the use of nickel in coins . Taxay suggested that Linderman was most likely influenced by Wharton and the metal 's other advocates . 
 By late 1869 , enough nickels , as the coin came to be called , had been produced to meet the needs of commerce , and production dropped off . The new coins tended to accumulate in the hands of merchants beyond the legal tender limit , but banks refused to accept them beyond the one @-@ dollar maximum . <unk> were forced to discount the coins to brokers . Postmasters , compelled by law to accept the coins , found that the Treasury would not accept them as deposits except in lots of $ 100 , in accordance with the authorizing statute . In 1871 , Congress alleviated the problem by passing legislation allowing the Treasury to redeem unlimited quantities of nickels and other low @-@ denomination coins when presented in lots of not less than $ 20 . It would not be until 1933 , long after the shield design passed from the scene , that the nickel was made legal tender without limit . 
 The Mint Act of 1873 ended the production of the half dime . Despite the abolition , the silver pieces continued to circulate in the West , where silver or gold coins were preferred , and the nickel was disliked , throughout the remainder of the 19th century . The act also gave the Mint Director the authority to suspend production of any denomination if additional coins were not needed . Improved economic conditions , combined with low silver prices , brought large quantities of hoarded silver coinage , including half dimes , into circulation beginning in April 1876 . In late 1876 , production of the Shield nickel was halted under the 1873 act . No Shield nickels were struck in 1877 or 1878 , excepting proof specimens for collectors . As the Treasury had a large stock of nickels in storage , only small numbers were struck over the next few years ; full @-@ scale production began again on December 12 , 1881 . The 1880 nickel , with only 16 @,@ 000 pieces struck for circulation , remains the rarest non @-@ proof Shield nickel today . 
 = = = Varieties = = = 
 The Shield nickel series has yielded a large number of varieties . Howard Spindel , a leading expert on Shield nickels , notes that Shield nickel dies produced far fewer coins than other coin dies , as the dies wore out so fast that the Mint was continually under great pressure to produce new ones . According to Spindel , many dies were hastily and carelessly produced , producing numerous minor varieties . 
 Bowers points to the 1868 nickel as " a playground for <unk> [ repunched dates ] , errors , and the like " . Specialists have found more than sixty different doubled die varieties , caused by misalignment when the heated die was repeatedly pressed against the hub to transfer the design . There are several different kinds of repunched dates , including a variety in which the numeral " 1 " is much smaller than usually found on the Shield nickel . 
 As with many denominations of United States coins , there are two major varieties of the 1873 piece . The initial variety , known as the " close 3 " or " closed 3 " was struck first . These coins led to a complaint by the chief coiner , A. Loudon Snowden , to Pollock , who was again director of the Mint . Snowden stated that the numeral " 3 " in the date too closely resembled an " 8 " . The Mint prepared new date punches , in which the arms of the 3 did not curl around toward the center , creating the second variety , the " open 3 " . 
 The final year of production saw an overdate , 1883 / 2 , with a visible " 2 " under or near the digit " 3 " . This variety was caused by the use of 1882 @-@ dated dies which were not destroyed at the end of the year , but were instead repunched with a four @-@ digit logotype , " 1883 " . Five different dies are known to have been so reused , and Bowers estimates a mintage of 118 @,@ 975 pieces . Spindel estimates that only 0 @.@ 2 % – 0 @.@ 3 % of the pieces have survived to the present . 
 = = Replacement = = 
 The 1867 redesign of the reverse had not solved the problems of short die life and poor striking ; with a view to a redesign , pattern coins were struck in 1868 and 1871 , but the Shield nickel remained in production . Charles E. Barber became chief engraver in 1880 , and the following year was asked to produce uniform designs for the nickel , the three @-@ cent piece , and a proposed copper @-@ nickel cent . While the redesign of the two lower denominations did not occur , in 1882 , Barber 's design for the nickel , with the head of the goddess of Liberty on the obverse and the Roman numeral " V " on the reverse , was approved . The following year the Barber design replaced the Shield nickel . Shield nickels dated 1883 had already been coined by the time the Barber design was ready , and Mint officials desired to discourage speculation . Accordingly , they kept the shield design in production for several months side by side with what became known as the Liberty Head nickel . Almost a million and a half Shield nickels were struck in 1883 . Coinage of the Shield nickel was ended on June 26 , 1883 . 
 = = Mintages = = 
 Shield nickel proof mintages from before 1878 are modern estimates and may vary — for example , Bowers estimates 800 – 1 @,@ 200 for the 1866 piece , while Peters estimates 375 + . The issue is complicated by the fact that restrikes were made of proofs , sometimes years after the inscribed date . Mint officials , despite what Bowers terms " official denials ( a.k.a. lies ) " , reused dies which had supposedly been destroyed to strike pieces for favored collectors or dealers . This practice led to incongruous pieces , with a dated obverse mated with a reverse not placed in use until years later . 
 All pieces struck at the Philadelphia mint , without mintmark .

 Zombia antillarum , commonly known as the zombie palm , is a species of palm tree and the only member of the genus Zombia . It is endemic to the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles . Usually found in dry , hilly areas of northern and southern Haiti and the northwest of the Dominican Republic , Z. antillarum is a relatively short fan palm with clustered stems and a very distinctive appearance caused by its persistent spiny leaf sheaths . Threatened by habitat destruction in Haiti , Z. antillarum is a popular ornamental species due to its distinctive appearance , low maintenance requirements and salt tolerance .

Individuals bear nine to 12 fan @-@ shaped ( or palmate ) leaves which are greyish @-@ white on the lower surface . The leaf sheaths remain attached to the stem after the leaf drops off . The intervening tissue gradually degrades , and the woody vascular tissue splits , forming the spines which are characteristic of the species . 
 The inflorescence , which is shorter than the leaves , bears bisexual flowers with 9 – 12 stamens and a single carpel . Fruit are white in colour ( although orange @-@ fruited individuals are also known to exist ) , oblong or pear @-@ shaped , 1 @.@ 5 – 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 – 0 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter and bear a single seed . The flowers and fruit are borne among the leaves due to the fact that the inflorescences are shorter than the leaves . Trees can produce 5000 seeds per year , predominantly in July and August . 
 The species is believed to be wind pollinated . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Zombia is a monotypic genus — it includes only one species , Z. antillarum . The earliest description of the species is found in the work of French physician and botanist Michel Étienne Descourtilz . In 1821 he placed it in the genus <unk> as C. antillarum . Italian naturalist <unk> Beccari independently described the species in 1908 , placing it in the genus Coccothrinax ( as C. anomala ) . Recognising that it was distinct enough to be placed in its own genus , American botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey erected the genus Zombia in 1931 to accommodate the species that Descourtilz had described . This generated the combination Z. antillarum . In selecting a name for the genus , Bailey noted that 
 it would be preferable if this endemic palm could bear a Latin name indicative of its nativity rather than an exotic binomial of no relation with its country and the people . 
 In 1941 another American botanist , Orator F. Cook , moved Beccari 's C. anomala to a new genus , <unk> . This generated a fourth combination , O. anomala . Since Descourtilz 's description pre @-@ dates that of Beccari , Zombia antillarum ( which is based on Descourtilz 's description ) has priority over <unk> anomala . In addition , Cook 's name is invalid , since it was apparently never formally described . 
 In the first edition of Genera <unk> ( 1987 ) , Natalie Uhl and John Dransfield placed the genus Zombia in the subfamily <unk> , the tribe <unk> and the subtribe <unk> using Harold E. Moore 's 1973 classification of the palm family . Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the Old World and New World members of the <unk> were not closely related . As a consequence of this , Zombia and related genera were places in their own tribe , <unk> . Within this tribe , Zombia appears to be most closely related to the genera Coccothrinax and <unk> , and the species Thrinax morrisii , with the remainder of the genus Thrinax being a sister taxon to this group . Because of this , T. morrisii was moved to a new genus , <unk> . 
 In 1960 Dominican botanist José de Jesús Jiménez Almonte described a variety of Z. antillarum which was distinguished from the typical variety by its smaller , pear @-@ shaped fruits with a " dirty yellow " colour . He named this variety Z. antillarum var. <unk> . More recent workers have not considered this form distinctive enough to maintain it as a distinct variety . 
 = = = Common names = = = 
 Zombia antillarum is called the " Zombie palm " or " Zombi palm " by horticulturists . Orator F. Cook coined the name " Haitian cactus palm " due to the spiny appearance of its trunk . In Haiti it is usually known as <unk> <unk> ( latanier <unk> in French ; the zombie fan palm ) , or <unk> <unk> , ( latanier piquant in French , the spiny fan palm ) . It is also called latanier <unk> or latanier marron . <unk> or latanier is a common term for fan palms in Haiti , so these names ( " savanna fan palm " and " wild fan palm " ) are not specific to this species ; they are also used for several species of Coccothrinax . In the Dominican Republic the species is called <unk> or <unk> . These are diminutives of guano , which is used for several species of Coccothrinax and Thrinax . In his 1821 description of the species , Descourtilz used the name latanier <unk> . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Zombia antillarum is endemic to the island of Hispaniola . In northern Haiti is grows along the tributaries of the Trois Rivières between Gros @-@ Morne and Port @-@ de @-@ Paix , while in south it is found along the eastern edge of the Massif de la <unk> , between Miragoâne , Fond @-@ des @-@ <unk> and Fond @-@ des @-@ Blancs . The species also occurs in northwestern parts of the Dominican Republic , between <unk> , <unk> , the Sierra de <unk> , Puerto Plata and Gaspar Hernández . It grows in dry hilly regions at low elevation , usually on slopes and ridges but is generally absent from the valley bottoms . In the Dominican Republic it is found from sea level up to 450 metres ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) above sea level . Zombia antillarum is associated with serpentine soils , but is also found on calcareous soils . In Haiti , Z. antillarum grows in association with a variety of other palms , including Coccothrinax argentea , Bactris <unk> , Roystonea borinquena , Sabal <unk> and S. domingensis . In the Dominican Republic it grows in association with Pinus occidentalis , <unk> <unk> , R. borinquena , S. domingensis , <unk> <unk> and C. argentea . 
 = = = Conservation status = = = 
 Although listed as " not threatened " in the 2006 IUCN Red List , a 2007 review of the status of West Indian palms classified Zombia antillarum as vulnerable based on a projected loss of 10 % of the population over the next century . In Haiti , the species is threatened by habitat destruction when land is cleared for agriculture . Seedlings can also be destroyed when they are browsed by livestock . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The plant is a popular ornamental , and is valued for its unusual appearance , low maintenance requirements , small stature and salt tolerance , and is recommended for low @-@ maintenance landscaping in South Florida . Leaves of Z. antillarum are used to weave hats and make brooms and the seeds , which have a protein content of 2 @.@ 8 – 4 @.@ 9 % , are used to feed pigs . South of Sabaneta in the Dominican Republic the petioles are reportedly " used to mix manioc flour for making cassava bread . " 
 In 1821 Michel Étienne Descourtilz reported that the wood was used for snuff boxes and tobacco cases , that the kernel of the seed was used to treat scurvy , and that the sap had been used by Carib Amerindians " for its powerful properties " . 
 Fabienne <unk> Taylor and Joel C. <unk> explored the connection between the " zombie palm " and beliefs about zombies . They found that oil extracted from the seeds has been described as a " sense @-@ activator " by one ethnographic source and can be used to " awaken " a zombie , and that a dwelling with thatch made from the leaves of the plant could prevent zombies from being used to spy on its occupants . Other sources , however , were reportedly unaware of this these uses . Taylor and <unk> concluded that 
 we were able to find a link , albeit weak , between the name Zombia and Haitian culture , even though we could not verify that this species is typically associated with zombies . 
 = Roman Baths ( Bath ) = 
 The Roman Baths complex is a site of historical interest in the English city of Bath . The house is a well @-@ preserved Roman site for public bathing . 
 The Roman Baths themselves are below the modern street level . There are four main features : the Sacred Spring , the Roman Temple , the Roman Bath House and the Museum holding finds from Roman Bath . The buildings above street level date from the 19th century . 
 The Baths are a major tourist attraction and , together with the Grand Pump Room , receive more than one million visitors a year . It was featured on the 2005 TV program Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of the West Country . Visitors can see the Baths and Museum but cannot enter the water . An audio guide is available in 12 languages . 
 = = How the hot springs form at the Bathhouse = = 
 The water which bubbles up from the ground at Bath falls as rain on the nearby Mendip Hills . It percolates down through limestone aquifers to a depth of between 2 @,@ 700 and 4 @,@ 300 metres ( 8 @,@ 900 and 14 @,@ 100 ft ) where geothermal energy raises the water temperature to between 69 and 96 ° C ( 156 @.@ 2 and 204 @.@ 8 ° F ) . Under pressure , the heated water rises to the surface along fissures and faults in the limestone . This process is similar to an artificial one known as Enhanced Geothermal System which also makes use of the high pressures and temperatures below the Earth 's crust . Hot water at a temperature of 46 ° C ( 114 @.@ 8 ° F ) rises here at the rate of 1 @,@ 170 @,@ 000 litres ( 257 @,@ 364 imp gal ) every day , from a geological fault ( the <unk> fault ) . In 1983 a new spa water bore @-@ hole was sunk , providing a clean and safe supply of spa water for drinking in the Pump Room . 
 = = History = = 
 The first shrine at the site of the hot springs was built by Celts , and was dedicated to the goddess Sulis , whom the Romans identified with Minerva . Geoffrey of Monmouth in his largely fictional Historia Regum Britanniae describes how in 836 BC the spring was discovered by the British king Bladud who built the first Moorish baths . Early in the 18th century Geoffrey 's obscure legend was given great prominence as a royal endorsement of the waters ' qualities , with the embellishment that the spring had cured Bladud and his herd of pigs of leprosy through wallowing in the warm mud . 
 = = = How the Romans used the building = = = 
 The name Sulis continued to be used after the Roman invasion , leading to the town 's Roman name of Aquae Sulis ( " the waters of Sulis " ) . The temple was constructed in 60 @-@ 70 AD and the bathing complex was gradually built up over the next 300 years . During the Roman occupation of Britain , and possibly on the instructions of Emperor Claudius , engineers drove oak piles to provide a stable foundation into the mud and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead . In the 2nd century it was enclosed within a wooden barrel @-@ vaulted building , and included the caldarium ( hot bath ) , tepidarium ( warm bath ) , and frigidarium ( cold bath ) . After the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the first decade of the 5th century , these fell into disrepair and were eventually lost due to silting up , and flooding . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle suggests the original Roman baths were destroyed in the 6th century . 
 About 130 curse tablets have been found . Many of the curses related to thefts of clothes whilst the victim was bathing . 
 = = = Redevelopment = = = 
 The baths have been modified on several occasions , including the 12th century when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King 's Spring reservoir and the 16th century when the city corporation built a new bath ( Queen 's Bath ) to the south of the Spring . The spring is now housed in 18th @-@ century buildings , designed by architects John Wood , the Elder and John Wood , the Younger , father and son . Visitors drank the waters in the Grand Pump Room , a neo @-@ classical salon which remains in use , both for taking the waters and for social functions . Victorian expansion of the baths complex followed the neo @-@ classical tradition established by the Woods . In 1810 the Hot Springs failed and William Smith opened up the Hot Bath Spring to the bottom , where he found that the spring had not failed but had flowed into a new channel . Smith restored the water to its original course and the Baths filled in less time than formerly . 
 The visitor entrance is via an 1897 concert hall by J M Brydon . It is an eastward continuation of the Grand Pump Room with a glass @-@ domed centre and single @-@ storey radiused corner . The Grand Pump Room was begun in 1789 by Thomas Baldwin . He resigned in 1791 and John Palmer continued the scheme until its completion in 1799 . The elevation on to Abbey Church Yard has a centre piece of four engaged Corinthian columns with entablatures and pediment . It has been designated by Historic England as a grade I listed building . The north colonnade was also designed by Thomas Baldwin . The south colonnade is similar but had an upper floor added in the late 19th century . The museum and Queen 's Bath including the " Bridge " spanning York Street to the City Laundry were by Charles Edward Davis in 1889 . It comprises a southward extension to the Grand Pump Room , in which some remains of the C17 Queen 's Bath are merged . 
 = = = Museum = = = 
 The museum houses artefacts from the Roman period including objects which were thrown into the Sacred Spring , presumably as offerings to the goddess . These include more than 12 @,@ 000 Roman currency coins which is the largest collective votive deposit known from Britain . A gilt bronze head of the goddess Sulis Minerva , which was discovered nearby in 1727 , is displayed . 
 The Bath Roman Temple stood on a podium more than two metres above the surrounding courtyard , approached by a flight of steps . On the approach there were four large , fluted Corinthian columns supporting a frieze and decorated pediment above . The pediment , parts of which are displayed in the museum , is the triangular ornamental section , 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) wide and 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) from the apex to the bottom , above the pillars on the front of the building . It featured the very powerful central image of the Gorgon ’ s head glowering down from a height of 15 metres on all who approached the <unk> great head itself has snakes entwined within its beard , wings above its ears , <unk> brows and a heavy moustache although there is some controversy about what this really represents as Gorgons are usually female . An alternative interpretation sees the central head as the image of a water god such as the image of Oceanus , and yet another as a Celtic sun god . In early 2010 various stones on the pediment were conserved and rearranged . 
 Also on display are the remains of the elaborate hypocaust heating system which served the sweat rooms .

 The late 19th century carvings of Roman Emperors and Governors of Roman Britain on the terrace overlooking the Great Bath are particularly susceptible to the effect of acid rain and are being protected with a wash of a sacrificial shelter coat every few years . Exhibits within the temple precincts are susceptible to warm air which had the effect of drawing corrosive salts out of the Roman stonework . To help reduce this , a new ventilation system was installed in 2006 . 
 In 2009 a grant of £ 90 @,@ 000 was made to Bath and North East Somerset Council to contribute towards the cost of re @-@ developing displays and improving access to the Roman Baths , by the Department for Culture , Media and Sport / Wolfson Fund , which was established to promote improvements in Museums and Galleries in England . 
 = = Water safety = = 
 Bath was charged with responsibility for the hot springs in a Royal Charter of 1591 granted by Elizabeth I. This duty has now passed to Bath and North East Somerset Council , who carry out monitoring of pressure , temperature and flow rates . The thermal waters contain sodium , calcium , chloride and sulphate ions in high concentrations . 
 The water that flows through the Roman Baths is considered unsafe for bathing , partly due to its having passed through the still @-@ functioning original lead pipes , and up until World War II , it was advertised on the basis of the radioactivity it contained . However , the more significant danger is now considered to be infectious diseases . In October 1978 , a young girl swimming with the Bath Dolphins , a local swimming club , in the restored Roman Bath contracted meningitis and died , leading to the closure of the bath for several years . Tests showed that <unk> fowleri , an extremely dangerous disease @-@ causing amoeba , was in the water . The newly constructed Thermae Bath Spa nearby , designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners , and the refurbished Cross Bath allow modern @-@ day bathers to experience the waters via a series of more recently drilled boreholes .

 = John Komnenos Asen = 
 John Komnenos Asen ( Bulgarian : Йоан <unk> Асен , Yoan <unk> Asen ; Greek : <unk> Κομνηνός <unk> , <unk> Komnēnos <unk> ; Serbian : Јован <unk> Асен , Jovan <unk> Asen ) was the ruler of the Principality of Valona from circa 1345 to 1363 , initially as a Serbian vassal and after 1355 as a largely independent lord . Descended from high @-@ ranking Bulgarian nobility , John was a brother of both Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria and Helena of Bulgaria , the wife of Tsar Stephen Dušan of Serbia . Perhaps in search of better opportunities , he emigrated to Serbia , where his sister was married . There , he was granted the title of despot by Stephen Dušan , who placed him in charge of his territories in modern south Albania . 
 As the despot of Valona , John established commercial ties with Venice and Ragusa , and he became a citizen of the former in 1353 . After the death of Dušan in 1355 , he took the side of the unsuccessful Simeon Uroš in the ensuing conflict for the Serbian throne . With Venetian assistance , John maintained the essentially independent status of the Principality of Valona . He probably died of the plague in 1363 and he was succeeded by Alexander Komnenos Asen , who was likely his son from his unknown first wife . John 's second marriage was to the former Epirote queen @-@ consort Anna Palaiologina . 
 = = Origin and Serbian vassalage = = 
 While the birth date of John Komnenos Asen is unknown , his origin is clearly documented in the sources . On both sides , he descended from the highest ranks of 14th @-@ century Bulgarian nobility . He was born to <unk> <unk> , a daughter of despot Shishman of Vidin , and Sratsimir , the despot of Kran . John 's mother was a descendant of the Asen dynasty as a grand granddaughter of Tsar Ivan Asen II . His siblings were Ivan Alexander , who would ascend to the Bulgarian throne in 1331 , and Helena , who married Serbian ruler Stephen Dušan in 1332 . Even though John was commonly referred to as a Komnenos in the sources , his relations to that Byzantine family are rather scarce . He had rights to that name either through his mother 's descent from the <unk> , themselves related to the Komnenoi , or through his marriage to Anna Palaiologina . 
 It is uncertain as to exactly why John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high @-@ ranking position in Bulgaria , as his ancestry and family ties would suggest . Bulgarian historian Ivan Bozhilov is of the opinion that John was not seeking political refuge in Serbia . Instead , it is most likely that he moved to that country with the belief that Serbia 's territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure him better career opportunities . Presumably , John accompanied his sister Helena when she moved to Serbia to marry Stephen Dušan in 1332 . 
 John was first mentioned as the despot of Valona in 1350 and his documented presence in the Albanian lands only dates to 1349 . However , he was most likely bestowed the title as early as 1345 or 1346 , when Stephen Dušan was proclaimed Emperor ( Tsar ) . American scholar John Fine believes this happened immediately after Stephen Dušan 's coronation in 1346 . Along with Stephen Dušan 's half @-@ brother , Simeon Uroš , and Jovan Oliver , John was one of three people to bear that title under Stephen Dušan . 
 John was installed as ruler of Valona in late 1345 , in the wake of the Serbian conquest of south Albania from the Byzantine Empire , which was concluded no later than August 1345 . Besides the Adriatic port of Valona ( modern Vlorë ) , John 's appanage included nearby <unk> and the inland castle of Berat to the northeast . Other than that , the extent of his domain is uncertain . Estimates of the area John ruled over range from all of central Albania to only the three cities mentioned , with the rest remaining under the government of local Albanian nobility , who owed allegiance either to John or to Stephen Dušan directly . To the south , John 's appanage bordered on the lands of Simeon Uroš , the ruler of Epirus . 
 = = Relations with Venice and independence = = 
 In 1349 , John plundered a Venetian commercial ship which had been shipwrecked on the coast he controlled , in accordance with the medieval principle of jus <unk> . This act necessitated the involvement of Stephen Dušan in order to settle the dispute between Venice and John , as evidenced by an official document from 13 April 1350 . Despite this conflict , under John the Principality of Valona was an active partner of Venice and Ragusa ( modern Dubrovnik ) in maritime commerce . Two receipts from 27 April 1350 document John 's role as a mediator in cattle , sugar and pepper trade and reveal that he received significant income from the Valona customs . The customs was profitable because the port was often visited by merchant ships . Even though all of these documents were written in Slavic , John signed his name in Greek , which testifies to his Hellenisation . At the time , John also had ties with the Mamluk rulers of Egypt , who addressed him as “ King of Serbia and Bulgaria ” in correspondence . 
 In 1353 , John and his family were granted Venetian citizenship , which hints that his domain was under the protection of Venice . The premature death of Stephen Dušan in 1355 plunged the Serbian Empire into civil war . In that conflict , John took the side of his wife 's son @-@ in @-@ law Simeon Uroš against the legitimate successor Stephen Uroš , who was Stephen Dušan 's son and Simeon Uroš 's nephew . While Simeon 's attempt at taking the throne was ill @-@ fated and Stephen Uroš even captured Berat in 1356 , John managed to preserve his remaining lands and became independent from both Simeon and Stephen Uroš . The threat of Nikephoros II Orsini , who was gaining ground in Thessaly and Epirus , forced John to request the dispatch of a Venetian warship and an administrator from Venice to take control of his domain , to which the republic obliged . 
 Bulgarian historian Hristo <unk> conjectures that after 1355 , John may have minted his own coinage intended for trade with partners outside the inner Balkans . He bases this theory on a new reading of several Latin @-@ language coin inscriptions as Monita <unk> <unk> instead of Monita <unk> Oliveri , as previously thought . The new reading , which would identify the coins as being minted by John , was proposed by Yugoslav numismatist Nedeljković , who rejects the initial attribution of these coins to Jovan Oliver . 
 A commercial document from 30 January 1359 , which testifies to John 's continuing trade relations with Venice , is chronologically the last reference to his activity in contemporary sources . While the date of his death was not recorded , it is likely that John perished during the plague epidemic which hit Valona and Durazzo ( today Durrës ) in 1363 . 
 = = Family = = 
 John 's first marriage probably dates to after his arrival in Serbia , though the identity of his first wife , if any , is unknown . If the next ruler of Valona , Alexander Komnenos Asen , was his son , then he would have been born circa 1346 – 1348 , as he was already an adult in 1363 – 1366 . This would place John 's potential first marriage a few years before Alexander 's estimated birth . Around 1350 – 1355 , John married Anna Palaiologina , a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini , the despot of Epirus . This marriage to an Epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised John 's position in the region . Besides Alexander , another very likely child of John Komnenos Asen was a certain <unk> , the wife of Balša II who had succeeded Alexander as ruler of Valona in early 1372 . 
 = Ashford v Thornton = 
 Ashford v Thornton ( 1818 ) 106 ER 149 is an English law case in the Court of King 's Bench that upheld the right of the defendant , on a private appeal from an acquittal for murder , to trial by battle . 
 In 1817 , Abraham Thornton was charged with the murder of Mary Ashford . Thornton had met Ashford at a dance , and had walked with her from the event . The next morning , Ashford was found drowned in a pit , with little outward signs of violence . Although public opinion was heavily against Thornton , the jury quickly acquitted him , and also found him not guilty of rape . 
 Mary 's brother , William Ashford , launched an appeal , and Thornton was rearrested . Thornton claimed the right to trial by battle , a medieval usage that had never been repealed by Parliament . Ashford argued that the evidence against Thornton was overwhelming , and that he was thus ineligible to wage battle . 
 The court decided that the evidence against Thornton was not overwhelming , and that trial by battle was a permissible option under law ; thus Thornton was granted trial by battle . Ashford declined the offer of battle and Thornton was freed from custody . Appeals such as Ashford 's were abolished by statute in 1819 , and with them the right to trial by battle . Thornton emigrated to the United States , where he died around 1860 . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Legal = = = 
 Trial by battle was a procedure which had been brought to Britain by the Normans ; it was not present in Saxon law . It was authorized in " appeals of murder " , that is , retrials by private prosecution following an acquittal for murder . If the plaintiff ( in an appeal of murder , the next @-@ of @-@ kin of the deceased ) requested such a retrial , the defendant could respond with the " wager of battle " , that is , requiring the plaintiff to settle the matter by combat , with the outcome to be ordained by God . Such an appeal , and such an offer of battle could also take place following an acquittal for treason or another felony . Appeals of murder were uncommon , had to be brought within a year and a day of the death , and were generally tried by jury . In 1815 , three years before Ashford v Thornton , an appeal of murder was brought in Dublin in O 'Reilly v Clancy , and the defendant demanded the wager of battle . Chief Judge William Downes ( later Lord Downes ) , faced with this case , asked : 
 Can it be possible that this " wager of battle " is being seriously insisted on ? Am I to understand that this monstrous proposition as being propounded by the bar — that we , the judges of the Court of King 's Bench — the recognized conservators of the public peace , are to become not merely the spectators , but the abettors of a mortal combat ? Is that what you require of us ? 
 No combat took place in Ireland ; the case was settled as Clancy agreed to plead guilty and was transported for life . 
 It is uncertain when the last actual trial by battle ( often spelled " battel " ) in Britain took place . While some references speak of such a trial being held in 1631 , records indicate that King Charles I intervened to prevent the battle . A 1638 case is less clear : the King again stepped in and judges acted to delay proceedings . No record survives of the outcome of the case , but no contemporary account speaks of the trial by battle actually taking place . The last certain judicial battle in Britain was in Scotland in 1597 , when Adam <unk> accused James Carmichael of murder , and killed him in battle . The last in England occurred in 1446 : a servant accused his master of treason . The master drank much wine before the battle and was slain by the servant . 
 The wager of battle was not always available to the defendant in an appeal of murder . If the defendant was taken in the <unk> ( that is , in the act of committing his crime ) , if he attempted to escape from prison , or if there was such strong evidence of guilt that there could be no effective denial , the defendant could not challenge . Similarly , if the plaintiff was a woman , above 60 years of age , a minor , lame or blind , he or she could decline the challenge , and the case would be determined by a jury . Peers of the realm , priests , and citizens of the City of London could also decline the battle if challenged . If the actual battle took place , it would occur in judicial lists , 60 feet ( 18 m ) square , following the taking of oaths against witchcraft and sorcery . If the defendant was defeated , and if he was still alive , he was to be hanged on the spot ; not even the King could pardon him from the divine judgment against him . However , if he defeated his opponent , or if he were able to fend off his opponent from sunrise to sunset , he would go free . If the plaintiff said the word craven ( " I am vanquished " ) , and gave up the fight , he was to be declared infamous , deprived of the privileges of a freeman , and was liable for damages to his successful opponent . 
 Proposals to abolish trial by battle were made in the 17th century , and twice in the 18th , but were unsuccessful . In 1774 , as part of the legislative response to the Boston Tea Party , Parliament considered a bill which would have abolished appeals of murder and trials by battle in the American colonies . It was successfully opposed by MP John Dunning , who called the appeal of murder " that great pillar of the Constitution " . Writer and MP Edmund Burke , on the other hand , supported the abolition , calling the appeal and wager " superstitious and barbarous to the last degree " . 
 = = = Death of Mary Ashford = = = 
 Mary Ashford , a young woman of about 20 years of age , worked as a general servant and housekeeper to her uncle , a farmer at Langley Heath , Warwickshire , between Birmingham and Sutton Coldfield . Her father was a gardener near Erdington . She worked as usual on 26 May 1817 , and planned to attend a party that evening at The Three Tuns , a public house more commonly known as the Tyburn House . The party was an " annual club @-@ feast and dance " , which attracted a large attendance . She met her friend , Hannah Cox , left her work clothes at Cox 's house in Erdington ( after having obtained nicer clothes from her mother 's house in the same village ) and journeyed to the Tyburn House , arriving there at 7 : 30 to find the dancing already begun . 
 Among those attending at the Tyburn House was Abraham Thornton , the son of a builder from Castle Bromwich . Thornton was about 24 years old and heavyset ; descriptions of him range from " well @-@ looking young fellow " to " of repulsive appearance " . When he saw Ashford , he inquired of another male attendee who she was . That party @-@ goer later alleged that , upon being told who she was , Thornton stated that he had been intimate with her sister three times , and would also be with Mary Ashford , or he would die for it . Thornton later denied this statement , which was a major source of the public animus towards him following his arrest . During the course of the evening , he was very attentive to Ashford , and she appeared to enjoy his company . 
 At about eleven o 'clock , Cox began urging Ashford to leave . When the two did leave , it was with Thornton , who accompanied Ashford closely , while Cox walked behind them . Instead of returning to Erdington , Ashford announced that she would go to her grandfather 's house , stating that it was closer to work . This was true , but ignored the fact that she would have to return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning . Cox journeyed to Erdington , while Ashford and Thornton went off together . At about a quarter to three , a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend 's house with a woman , and greeted Thornton , but the woman ( undoubtedly Ashford ) held her bonnet over her face . Just before 4 a.m. , Cox was awakened by Ashford , seeking her working clothes . Ashford changed and hurried off , stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market . A returning <unk> from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly . He was the last person known to see her alive . 
 At around 6 a.m. , a passing labourer saw women 's items near a water @-@ filled pit . One of the items was a woman 's shoe with blood on it . He raised the alarm . He and others were able to use a rake to find a body in the pit – that of Mary Ashford . Two workers from a nearby factory found a series of footprints on the newly harrowed field near the pit , showing that a man and a woman had travelled together , almost up to the pit , and that the man returned alone . Ashford was known to many of those who gathered around the pit , as was the fact that she had gone to Tyburn the previous evening . The local mill owner , who took charge , went to Tyburn to discover with whom Ashford had left the party . Daniel Clarke , the landlord , began to ride towards Castle Bromwich to try to locate Thornton , and encountered him almost at once . When Clarke told Thornton of Ashford 's death , Thornton stated that he was with her until 4 a.m. , and at Clarke 's request went with him to Tyburn . 
 Thomas Dales , an assistant constable , arrived from Birmingham , where he was one of those responsible for policing the town . On ascertaining the situation he interrogated Thornton , and soon arrested him . However , Dales did not keep any notes and later proved unable to remember much of what the prisoner told him . Thornton was then examined by the local magistrate , William Bedford , who ordered Thornton searched . The search revealed that Thornton was wearing underclothing with bloodstains , and Thornton admitted having sexual intercourse with Ashford the previous night . The prisoner 's shoes were removed , and comparisons with the footprints in the field were made by the factory workers , who later testified at trial that they matched . A post @-@ mortem examination revealed that Ashford died from drowning , and that the only marks on her body were two lacerations in the genital area . The examination concluded that until the sexual act which caused the bleeding , Ashford was a virgin . She was menstruating at the time of her death .

 An inquest was held on 30 May 1817 , and was presided over by Francis Hacket , a Warwickshire magistrate who by virtue of his position as Warden of Sutton Coldfield was coroner ex officio . Thornton attended in custody , and was permitted to cross @-@ examine witnesses through his solicitor . At the end of the proceedings , a verdict of " Wilful Murder " was returned , and Thornton was committed for trial at the next assizes in Warwick on the Coroner 's Warrant . Thornton was held in the county gaol pending the trial . 
 Local opinion was heavily against Thornton . Pamphlets were sold purporting to show Thornton 's guilt , and poems were composed with the same theme . The defendant 's solicitor complained of these , alleging it made it hard to find an unbiased jury . On 8 August 1817 , people filled the street in front of County Hall in Warwick , where the trial was to take place . When the judge began proceedings at 8 a.m. , people rushed to fill the available seating , and the public benches remained full throughout the one @-@ day trial . Because of the nature of the evidence , women were not permitted to witness the trial . 
 The prosecution 's theory of the case , as told in its opening statement to the jury , was that Thornton , having failed in his attempt to seduce Ashford , lay in wait for her in the field near the pit . He knew she would have to cross the field on her return from Erdington . On perceiving him , she attempted to elude him , but he caught her and got her to accompany him into the next field . There , he threw her down and ravished her . The post @-@ mortem showed that she had not eaten in 24 hours , and according to the prosecuting counsel , she was unable to resist and fainted . Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with an unconscious woman whom he had treated in such a manner , Thornton threw her into the pit , where she drowned . At that time , defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury , and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case . 
 A number of witnesses , including Hannah Cox , testified to the events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning . The first witnesses to attract significant cross @-@ examination by William Reader , Thornton 's barrister , were the two factory workers , William Lavell and Joseph Bird , who had matched Thornton 's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field . Under cross @-@ examination , both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints . Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched : that is , before his bloodstained clothing came to light . Mr Freer , a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post @-@ mortem , testified as to its results , and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations , there were no signs of violence on Ashford 's person , and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations . Freer 's testimony concluded the prosecution case , and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court , the defence began calling witnesses . 
 Through its eleven witnesses , the defence established an alibi for Thornton . Milkman William Jennings ( in some sources <unk> ) testified that he saw Thornton at 4 : 30 am , walking leisurely by the farm of John Holden , where Jennings went to buy milk . The Holden farm was 2 @.@ 25 to 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 3 @.@ 6 to 4 @.@ 0 km ) from the pit , depending on the path taken . At about 4 : 50 a.m. , Thornton was seen at Castle Bromwich by a gamekeeper , John Heydon . Thornton told Heydon that he was with a woman much of the night , and after the two spent about fifteen minutes conversing , Thornton went on towards his father 's house . The defence contended that for Thornton to have murdered Ashford , he would have had to chase her down , rape her , kill her , and then travel three miles ( 5 km ) , all in at most eleven minutes . 
 The witnesses took ten hours to testify , during which time the court sat continuously . After a short break , the judge , George Holroyd , a justice of the Court of King 's Bench , began his summing up , taking two hours to charge the jury . The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads ; they were here to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged . He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton , his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4 a.m. The judge told them it was not possible for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still have made it to the Holden farm by the time he was seen by Heydon , and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran . The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted . The jury never left the box , but instead conferred together and found Thornton not guilty in six minutes . They were then <unk> on the rape allegation . The prosecution informed the court that it had no evidence to offer on that count , and Mr Justice Holroyd directed the jury to find the prisoner not guilty of rape , which they did . Thornton was set free . 
 = = Appeal = = 
 The acquittal of Thornton was met with outrage in Warwickshire , and indeed across the country . Newspapers published letters and comments which were extremely hostile toward Thornton . The leading papers in this campaign were the Lichfield Mercury and the Independent Whig , but even The Times expressed delight when it learned that the case would be further pursued . Funds were obtained from contributors , and a local solicitor prevailed on Mary 's brother , William Ashford , to bring an appeal of murder against Thornton . William Ashford was described as " a plain country young man , about twenty @-@ two years of age , of short stature , sandy hair , and blue eyes " . A writ of appeal was issued on 1 October 1817 , and Thornton was arrested on a warrant issued pursuant to that writ . As the appeal was to be tried before the King 's Bench in London , Thornton was taken to London on 28 October . Supporters of the Ashford family did their best to find evidence to upset his alibi . They had little success . On 6 November , the case first came before the Court , but was quickly adjourned until the 17th when Reader indicated that he had just been instructed , and needed more time to advise his client as to his plea . The initial hearing was little attended , apparently because the public did not realise the notorious Thornton would be there in person . 
 The Warwickshire magistrate , Bedford , was now acting as solicitor for William Ashford . At first , he saw no reason for uneasiness in the appeal . However , on 11 November , he wrote to his clerk , 
 I am sorry to say that difficulties have been started likely to occasion much trouble and perhaps ultimate <unk> it seems the Appellee [ Thornton ] has the option of waging Battle and of challenging the <unk> [ William Ashford ] in single combat which if not accepted by the <unk> the suit is lost and , if accepted , and the Appellee can hold out from sun rise to sun set , then he wins the contest and claims his discharge , otherwise his election subjects him not only to a good threshing [ sic ] but also the pain of death into the bargain . It is rumoured here that is the plea intended to be set up by the <unk> and unless we can devise any means by <unk> [ sic ] to induce the Court not to allow it , I am very apprehensive our poor little Knight will never be able to contend the Battle with his brutish opponent . 
 When the case came to be heard in the King 's Bench on 17 November , a huge crowd packed Westminster Hall to such an extent that counsel had great difficulty in entering . When Thornton was called upon for his plea , he responded , " Not guilty ; and I am ready to defend the same with my body . " He then put on one of a pair of leather gauntlets , which Reader handed him . Thornton threw down the other for William Ashford to pick up and thus accept the challenge , which Ashford did not do . Instead , his counsel , Nathaniel Clarke , argued that Thornton should not be able to compound his murder of the sister with an attempt to murder the brother , to which the Lord Chief Justice , Lord Ellenborough responded , " It is the law of England , Mr Clarke ; we must not call it murder . " Clarke then argued Ashford 's youth and lack of bodily strength as a reason not to allow the battle . Reader , in reply , stated that Ashford 's counsel should not waste the Court 's time by arguing that trial by battle was unwise because of Ashford 's physical condition , but should file responsive pleadings and allow the case to move forward . Reader also noted that he and his co @-@ counsel had advised Thornton to wage battle out of concern that with the " extraordinary and unprecedented prejudice " against the defendant , a fair jury could not be obtained . The matter was adjourned to 22 November to allow Ashford 's counsel to file pleadings . 
 At subsequent hearings , each side submitted replications ( affidavits ) with his version of the evidence . Ashford sought for the Court to rule that the evidence against Thornton was strong and that the defendant was thus ineligible to wage battle ; Thornton sought the opposite . Much of the case was argued between 6 and 8 February 1818 , but one of Ashford 's counsel , Joseph Chitty , asked for and received more time so he could reply to the other side 's arguments , and the matter was adjourned until 16 April . Chitty then responded but was so often interrupted in his argument by the judges that when he sat down , according to Sir John Hall in his book on the affair , " it was clear to everyone in Court that his client had lost his case " . 
 The judges conferred for about a quarter of an hour , and then delivered judgment <unk> ( one after the other ) . All four ruled for Thornton , holding that the evidence against him was not so strong as to oust his right to battle . Lord Ellenborough stated that 
 The discussion which has taken place here , and the consideration which has been given to the facts alleged , most conclusively show that this is not a case that can admit of no denial or proof to the contrary ; under these circumstances , however obnoxious I am myself to the trial by battle , it is the mode of trial which we , in our judicial character , are bound to award . We are delivering the law as it is , and not as we wish it to be , and therefore we must pronounce our judgment , that the battle must take place . 
 After the other judges delivered their judgments , Lord Ellenborough concluded , 
 The general law of this land is in favour of the wager of battle , and it is our duty to pronounce the law as it is , and not as we may wish it to be . Whatever prejudices may exist therefore against this mode of trial , still as it is the law of the land , the Court must pronounce judgment for it . 
 However , Lord Ellenborough indicated that Ashford could ask that Thornton be allowed " to go without a day " , that is , be released without obligation to return to court . The matter was adjourned until 20 April for Ashford to consider his options , whether to allow Thornton 's release or meet him in battle . On 20 April , Ashford 's counsel indicated that he had no objection to Thornton 's discharge , so long as no action would be taken against his client . With the appellant reassured on that point , the appeal was dismissed . Thornton was then given a pro forma arraignment on the murder charge , to which he interposed a plea that he was acquitted previously . The plea being accepted , the case was ended , and Thornton was freed . With an angry mob outside , Thornton left ( at Lord Ellenborough 's direction ) through a side door . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In June 1819 , Lord Eldon , the Lord Chancellor , introduced a bill to abolish private appeals following acquittals , and also abolish trial by battle . The act passed in great haste , with all three of the required readings of the bill in the House of Lords passing on one night . According to Sir Robert Megarry , who wrote of Ashford v Thornton in 2005 , the haste was due to a wager of battle being made in another case , though the names of the parties are not known . The act , which was recorded as 59 Geo . III , Chapter 46 , recited , " whereas appeals of murder , treason , felony , and other offences , and the manner of proceeding therein , have been found to be oppressive ; and the trial by battle in any suit , is a mode of trial unfit to be used ; and it is expedient that the same should be wholly abolished . " The Act abolished appeals of murder and other offences , and enacted in section 2 : " that from and after the passing of this act , in any writ of right now depending , or which may hereafter be brought , instituted , or commenced , the tenant shall not be received to wage battel , nor shall issue be joined nor trial be had by battel in any writ of right ; any law , custom , or usage to the contrary notwithstanding . " 
 Abraham Thornton returned to Castle Bromwich , but found the general dislike in which he was held unbearable . He booked passage to New York aboard the Independence , but when his fellow passengers found out who he was , they insisted on his being put ashore . On 30 September 1818 , Abraham Thornton sailed from Liverpool aboard the Shamrock to New York . In the United States , he worked as a bricklayer , married and had children . He died around 1860 in Baltimore . William Ashford , who for many years worked as a fish @-@ hawker in Birmingham , was found dead in his bed there in January 1867 , at the age of seventy . According to Walter Thornbury , who wrote of the case in the late 19th century , " The causes of Mary Ashford 's death , only the Last Day can now reveal . " 
 Academics have argued that Ashford v Thornton inspired the judicial combat which is the climax of Sir Walter Scott 's Ivanhoe . Scott mentioned the case in his other writings , discussed it with his friends , and backdated the dedication to the book two years to the date of Thornton 's wager of battle . An attempt was made in 1985 to claim trial by battle , brought by two brothers in Scotland who were accused of armed robbery , on the grounds that the abolition did not apply in Scotland . The attempt failed when the defendants could offer no evidence to oust the statutory presumption that Parliamentary acts apply to the entire United Kingdom . In 2002 , a 60 @-@ year @-@ old man , faced with a £ 25 fine for a minor motoring offence , appeared before magistrates and demanded trial by battle against a champion to be nominated by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency . He stated that trial by battle was still valid under European human rights legislation . Magistrates fined him £ 200 , with £ 100 costs .

 = = Publication history and contents = = 
 Although science fiction had been published before the 1920s , it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories , a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback . By the end of the 1930s the field was booming . In 1938 Abraham and Martin Goodman , two brothers who owned a publishing company with multiple imprints , launched Marvel Science Stories , edited by Robert O. Erisman . In February of the following year they added Dynamic Science Stories as a companion magazine intended to run longer stories . The contents were typical pulp science fiction , with few memorable stories . Science fiction historians Joseph Marchesani and Mike Ashley identify only three stories of quality : Nelson S. Bond 's " The Message from the Void " ( published under the pseudonym " Hubert <unk> " ) ; L. Sprague de Camp 's " Ananias " ; and Manly Wade Wellman 's " Insight " . The cover for the first issue was painted by Frank R. Paul , a popular cover artist recently returned to the science fiction field ; Norman Saunders provided the second cover . Dynamic 's sister magazine , Marvel Science Stories , often published stories with more sexual content than was usual for science fiction magazines of the day , but , although Dynamic 's advertising included books offering sexual advice , the magazine 's actual content was more traditional pulp material . The magazine only lasted two issues , though it is not known whether this was because of poor sales or if the cancellation was " a reflection of the whim of the publisher " , in Ashley 's words .

 The publisher of Dynamic Science Stories was Western Fiction Publishing Co . , based in Chicago , with editorial offices in Radio City , New York . There was one volume of two numbers . Both issues were in pulp format , 112 pages long , and priced at 15 cents . There was a British reprint edition of the first issue ; it appeared in 1939 and was undated . The editor of both issues was Robert O. Erisman , who was not credited in the magazine . 
 = Somerset = 
 Somerset ( / <unk> / ) is a county in South West England which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north , Wiltshire to the east , Dorset to the south @-@ east and Devon to the south @-@ west . It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel , its coastline facing southeastern Wales . Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon . Somerset 's county town is Taunton . 
 Somerset is a rural county of rolling hills such as the Blackdown Hills , Mendip Hills , Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park , and large flat expanses of land including the Somerset Levels . There is evidence of human occupation from Paleolithic times , and of subsequent settlement in the Roman and Anglo @-@ Saxon periods . The county played a significant part in the consolidation of power and rise of King Alfred the Great , and later in the English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion . The city of Bath is famous for its substantial Georgian architecture and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 = = Toponymy = = 
 Somerset 's name derives from Old English <unk> , short for <unk> , meaning " the people living at or dependent on <unk> " ( Somerton ) . The first known use of <unk> is in the law code of King Ine who was the Saxon King of Wessex from 688 to 726 , making Somerset along with Hampshire , Wiltshire and Dorset one of the oldest extant units of local government in the world . An alternative suggestion is the name derives from Seo @-@ mere @-@ <unk> meaning " settlers by the sea lakes " . 
 The people of Somerset are mentioned in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle 's entry for AD 845 , in the inflected form " <unk> " , and the county is recorded in the entry for 1015 using the same name . The archaic name Somersetshire was mentioned in the Chronicle 's entry for 878 . Although " Somersetshire " was in common use as an alternative name for the county , it went out of fashion in the late 19th century , and is no longer used possibly due to the adoption of " Somerset " as the county 's official name after the establishment of the county council in 1889 . As with other counties not ending in " shire , " the suffix was superfluous , as there was no need to differentiate between the county and a town within it . 
 The Old English name is used in the motto of the county , <unk> <unk> , meaning " all the people of Somerset " . Adopted as the motto in 1911 , the phrase is taken from the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . Somerset was a part of the Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdom of Wessex , and the phrase refers to the wholehearted support the people of Somerset gave to King Alfred in his struggle to save Wessex from Viking invaders . 
 Somerset is <unk> yr <unk> in Welsh , <unk> an <unk> in Cornish and Bro an <unk> in Breton , which all mean " Country of the Summer " . 
 Somerset settlement names are mostly Anglo @-@ Saxon in origin , but some hill names include Brittonic Celtic elements . For example , an Anglo @-@ Saxon charter of 682 refers to <unk> Hill as " the hill the British call <unk> and we call <unk> " ( " we " being the Anglo @-@ Saxons ) . Some modern names are Brythonic in origin , such as <unk> , while others have both Saxon and Brythonic elements , such as Pen Hill . 
 = = History = = 
 The caves of the Mendip Hills were settled during the Palaeolithic period , and contain extensive archaeological sites such as those at Cheddar Gorge . Bones from Gough 's Cave have been dated to 12 @,@ 000 BC , and a complete skeleton , known as Cheddar Man , dates from 7150 BC . Examples of cave art have been found in Aveline 's Hole . Some caves continued to be occupied until modern times , including Wookey Hole . 
 The Somerset Levels — specifically dry points at Glastonbury and Brent Knoll — also have a long history of settlement , and are known to have been settled by Mesolithic hunters . Travel in the area was facilitated by the construction of one of the world 's oldest known engineered roadways , the Sweet Track , which dates from 3807 BC or 3806 BC . 
 The exact age of the henge monument at Stanton Drew stone circles is unknown , but it is believed to be Neolithic . There are numerous Iron Age hill forts , some of which , like Cadbury Castle and Ham Hill , were later reoccupied in the Early Middle Ages . 
 On the authority of the future emperor Vespasian , as part of the ongoing expansion of the Roman presence in Britain , the Second Legion Augusta invaded Somerset from the south @-@ east in AD 47 . The county remained part of the Roman Empire until around AD 409 , when the Roman occupation of Britain came to an end . A variety of Roman remains have been found , including Pagans Hill Roman temple in Chew Stoke , Low Ham Roman Villa and the Roman Baths that gave their name to the city of Bath . 
 After the Romans left , Britain was invaded by Anglo @-@ Saxon peoples . By AD 600 they had established control over much of what is now England , but Somerset was still in native British hands . The British held back Saxon advance into the south @-@ west for some time longer , but by the early eighth century King Ine of Wessex had pushed the boundaries of the West Saxon kingdom far enough west to include Somerset . The Saxon royal palace in Cheddar was used several times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot . After the Norman Conquest , the county was divided into 700 fiefs , and large areas were owned by the crown , with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence . Somerset contains HM Prison Shepton Mallet , which was England 's oldest prison still in use prior to its closure in 2013 , having opened in 1610 . In the English Civil War Somerset was largely Parliamentarian , with key engagements being the Sieges of Taunton and the Battle of Langport . In 1685 the Monmouth Rebellion was played out in Somerset and neighbouring Dorset . The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and travelled north , hoping to capture Bristol and Bath , but they were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland , the last pitched battle fought in England . Arthur Wellesley took his title , Duke of Wellington from the town of Wellington ; he is commemorated on a nearby hill by a large , spotlit obelisk , known as the Wellington Monument . 
 The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelled the end for most of Somerset 's cottage industries . Farming continued to flourish , however , and the Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture , Arts , Manufactures and Commerce was founded in 1777 to improve farming methods . Despite this , 20 years later John Billingsley conducted a survey of the county 's agriculture in 1795 and found that agricultural methods could still be improved . Coal mining was an important industry in north Somerset during the 18th and 19th centuries , and by 1800 it was prominent in Radstock . The Somerset Coalfield reached its peak production by the 1920s , but all the pits have now been closed , the last in 1973 . Most of the surface buildings have been removed , and apart from a winding wheel outside Radstock Museum , little evidence of their former existence remains . Further west , the Brendon Hills were mined for iron ore in the late 19th century ; this was taken by the West Somerset Mineral Railway to Watchet Harbour for shipment to the furnaces at Ebbw Vale . 
 Many Somerset soldiers died during the First World War , with the Somerset Light Infantry suffering nearly 5 @,@ 000 casualties . War memorials were put up in most of the county 's towns and villages ; only nine , described as the Thankful Villages , had none of their residents killed . During the Second World War the county was a base for troops preparing for the D @-@ Day landings . Some of the hospitals which were built for the casualties of the war remain in use . The Taunton Stop Line was set up to repel a potential German invasion . The remains of its pill boxes can still be seen along the coast , and south through Ilminster and Chard . 
 A number of decoy towns were constructed in Somerset in World War II to protect Bristol and other towns , at night . They were designed to mimic the geometry of " blacked out " streets , railway lines , and Bristol Temple Meads railway station , to encourage bombers away from these targets . One , on the radio beam flight path to Bristol , was constructed on Beacon Batch . It was laid out by Shepperton Studios , based on aerial photographs of the city 's railway marshalling yards . The decoys were fitted with dim red lights , simulating activities like the stoking of steam locomotives . Burning bales of straw soaked in creosote were used to simulate the effects of incendiary bombs dropped by the first wave of Pathfinder night bombers ; meanwhile , incendiary bombs dropped on the correct location were quickly smothered , wherever possible . Drums of oil were also ignited to simulate the effect of a blazing city or town , with the aim of fooling subsequent waves of bombers into dropping their bombs on the wrong location . The Chew Magna decoy town was hit by half @-@ a @-@ dozen bombs on 2 December 1940 , and over a thousand incendiaries on 3 January 1941 . The following night the Uphill decoy town , protecting Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare 's airfield , was bombed ; a herd of dairy cows was hit , killing some and severely injuring others . 
 = = Human geography = = 
 = = = Boundaries = = = 
 The boundaries of Somerset are largely unaltered from medieval times . The River Avon formed much of the border with Gloucestershire , except that the hundred of Bath Forum , which straddles the Avon , formed part of Somerset . Bristol began as a town on the Gloucestershire side of the Avon , however as it grew it extended across the river into Somerset . In 1373 Edward III proclaimed " that the town of Bristol with its suburbs and precincts shall henceforth be separate from the counties of Gloucester and Somerset ... and that it should be a county by itself " . 
 The present @-@ day northern border of Somerset ( adjoining the counties of Bristol and Gloucestershire ) runs along the southern bank of the Avon from the Bristol Channel , then follows around the southern edge of the Bristol built @-@ up area , before continuing upstream along the Avon , and then diverges from the river to include Bath and its historic hinterland to the north of the Avon , before meeting Wiltshire at the Three Shire Stones on the Fosse Way at <unk> . 
 = = = Cities and towns = = = 
 Somerton took over from Ilchester as the county town in the late thirteenth century , but it declined in importance and the status of county town transferred to Taunton about 1366 . The county has two cities , Bath and Wells , and 30 towns ( including the county town of Taunton , which has no town council but instead is the chief settlement of the county 's only borough ) . The largest urban areas in terms of population are Bath , Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare , Taunton , Yeovil and Bridgwater . Many settlements developed because of their strategic importance in relation to geographical features , such as river crossings or valleys in ranges of hills . Examples include Axbridge on the River Axe , Castle Cary on the River Cary , North Petherton on the River Parrett , and Ilminster , where there was a crossing point on the River Isle . Midsomer Norton lies on the River Somer ; while the Wellow Brook and the Fosse Way Roman road run through Radstock . Chard is the most southerly town in Somerset , and at an altitude of 121 m ( 397 ft ) it is also the highest . 
 = = Physical geography = = 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 Much of the landscape of Somerset falls into types determined by the underlying geology . These landscapes are the limestone karst and lias of the north , the clay vales and wetlands of the centre , the <unk> of the east and south , and the Devonian sandstone of the west . 
 To the north @-@ east of the Somerset Levels , the Mendip Hills are moderately high limestone hills . The central and western Mendip Hills was designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in 1972 and covers 198 km2 ( 76 sq mi ) . The main habitat on these hills is calcareous grassland , with some arable agriculture . To the south @-@ west of the Somerset Levels are the Quantock Hills which was England 's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty designated in 1956 which is covered in heathland , oak woodlands , ancient parklands with plantations of conifer and covers 99 square kilometres . The Somerset Coalfield is part of a larger coalfield which stretches into Gloucestershire . To the north of the Mendip hills is the Chew Valley and to the south , on the clay substrate , are broad valleys which support dairy farming and drain into the Somerset Levels . 
 = = = Caves and rivers = = = 
 There is an extensive network of caves , including Wookey Hole , underground rivers , and gorges , including the Cheddar Gorge and Ebbor Gorge . The county has many rivers , including the Axe , Brue , Cary , Parrett , Sheppey , Tone and Yeo . These both feed and drain the flat levels and moors of mid and west Somerset . In the north of the county the River Chew flows into the Bristol Avon . The Parrett is tidal almost to Langport , where there is evidence of two Roman wharfs . At the same site during the reign of King Charles I , river tolls were levied on boats to pay for the maintenance of the bridge . 
 = = = Levels and moors = = = 
 The Somerset Levels ( or Somerset Levels and Moors as they are less commonly but more correctly known ) are a sparsely populated wetland area of central Somerset , between the Quantock and Mendip hills . They consist of marine clay levels along the coast , and the inland ( often peat based ) moors . The Levels are divided into two by the Polden Hills ; land to the south is drained by the River Parrett while land to the north is drained by the River Axe and the River Brue . The total area of the Levels amounts to about 647 @.@ 5 square kilometres ( 160 @,@ 000 acres ) and broadly corresponds to the administrative district of Sedgemoor but also includes the south west of Mendip district . Approximately 70 % of the area is grassland and 30 % is arable . Stretching about 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) inland , this expanse of flat land barely rises above sea level . Before it was drained , much of the land was under a shallow brackish sea in winter and was marsh land in summer . Drainage began with the Romans , and was restarted at various times : by the Anglo @-@ Saxons ; in the Middle Ages by the Glastonbury Abbey , from 1400 – 1770 ; and during the Second World War , with the construction of the Huntspill River . Pumping and management of water levels still continues . 
 The North Somerset Levels basin , north of the Mendips , covers a smaller geographical area than the Somerset Levels ; and forms a coastal area around Avonmouth . It too was reclaimed by draining . It is mirrored , across the Severn Estuary , in Wales , by a similar low @-@ lying area : the Caldicot and <unk> Levels . 
 In the far west of the county , running into Devon , is Exmoor , a high Devonian sandstone moor , which was designated as a national park in 1954 , under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act . The highest point in Somerset is Dunkery Beacon on Exmoor , with an altitude of 519 metres ( 1 @,@ 703 feet ) . 
 Over 100 sites in Somerset have been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest . 
 = = = Coastline = = = 
 The 64 km ( 40 mi ) coastline of the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary forms part of the northern border of Somerset . The Bristol Channel has the second largest tidal range in the world . At Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea , for example , the tidal range of a spring tide is more than 12 metres ( 39 feet ) . Proposals for the construction of a Severn Barrage aim to harness this energy . The island of Steep Holm in the Bristol Channel is within the ceremonial county and is now administered by North Somerset Council . 
 The main coastal towns are , from the west to the north @-@ east , Minehead , Watchet , Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea , Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare , Clevedon and Portishead . The coastal area between Minehead and the eastern extreme of the administrative county 's coastline at Brean Down is known as Bridgwater Bay , and is a National Nature Reserve . North of that , the coast forms Weston Bay and Sand Bay whose northern tip , Sand Point , marks the lower limit of the Severn Estuary . In the mid and north of the county the coastline is low as the level wetlands of the levels meet the sea . In the west , the coastline is high and dramatic where the plateau of Exmoor meets the sea , with high cliffs and waterfalls . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Along with the rest of South West England , Somerset has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country . The annual mean temperature is approximately 10 ° C ( 50 @.@ 0 ° F ) . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures . The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately 21 ° C ( 69 @.@ 8 ° F ) . In winter mean minimum temperatures of 1 ° C ( 33 @.@ 8 ° F ) or 2 ° C ( 35 @.@ 6 ° F ) are common . In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south @-@ west of England , but convective cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine . Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1 @,@ 600 hours . In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton . Most the rainfall in the south @-@ west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection . Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions , which is when they are most active . In summer , a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms . Average rainfall is around 700 mm ( 28 in ) . About 8 – 15 days of snowfall is typical . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds , and June to August the lightest winds . The predominant wind direction is from the south @-@ west . 
 = = Economy and industry = = 
 Somerset has few industrial centres , but it does have a variety of light industry and high technology businesses , along with traditional agriculture and an increasingly important tourism sector , resulting in an unemployment rate of 2 @.@ 5 % . Unemployment is lower than the national average ; the largest employment sectors are retail , manufacturing , tourism , and health and social care . Population growth in the county is higher than the national average . 
 Bridgwater was developed during the Industrial Revolution as the area 's leading port . The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater . Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay , next to the Bridgwater Bridge , to be carried further up river to Langport ; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton . The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf . Bridgwater , in the 19th and 20th centuries , was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles , and later cellophane , but those industries have now stopped . With its good links to the motorway system , Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos , <unk> , Morrisons and Gerber Juice . AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil , and <unk> Garratt , builder of aircraft oxygen systems , is also based in the town . Many towns have encouraged small @-@ scale light industries , such as Crewkerne 's Ariel Motor Company , one of the UK 's smallest car manufacturers . 
 Somerset is an important supplier of defence equipment and technology . A Royal Ordnance Factory , ROF Bridgwater was built at the start of the Second World War , between the villages of Puriton and <unk> , to manufacture explosives . The site was decommissioned and closed in July 2008 . <unk> has Thales Underwater Systems , and Taunton presently has the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and <unk> , which became part of Thales Optics . It has been announced twice , in 2006 and 2007 , that manufacturing is to end at Thales Optics ' Taunton site , but the trade unions and Taunton Deane District Council are working to reverse or mitigate these decisions . Other high @-@ technology companies include the optics company Gooch and <unk> , at Ilminster . There are Ministry of Defence offices in Bath , and Norton Fitzwarren is the home of 40 Commando Royal Marines . The Royal Naval Air Station in Yeovilton , is one of Britain 's two active Fleet Air Arm bases and is home to the Royal Navy 's Lynx helicopters and the Royal Marines Commando Westland Sea Kings . Around 1 @,@ 675 service and 2 @,@ 000 civilian personnel are stationed at Yeovilton and key activities include training of aircrew and engineers and the Royal Navy 's Fighter Controllers and surface @-@ based aircraft controllers . 
 Agriculture and food and drink production continue to be major industries in the county , employing over 15 @,@ 000 people . Apple orchards were once plentiful , and Somerset is still a major producer of cider . The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet are involved with the production of cider , especially Blackthorn Cider , which is sold nationwide , and there are specialist producers such as Burrow Hill Cider Farm and Thatchers Cider . Gerber Products Company in Bridgwater is the largest producer of fruit juices in Europe , producing brands such as " Sunny Delight " and " Ocean Spray . " Development of the milk @-@ based industries , such as Ilchester Cheese Company and Yeo Valley Organic , have resulted in the production of ranges of desserts , <unk> and cheeses , including Cheddar cheese — some of which has the West Country Farmhouse Cheddar Protected Designation of Origin ( PDO ) . 
 Traditional willow growing and weaving ( such as basket weaving ) is not as extensive as it used to be but is still carried out on the Somerset Levels and is commemorated at the Willows and Wetlands Visitor Centre . Fragments of willow basket were found near the Glastonbury Lake Village , and it was also used in the construction of several Iron Age causeways . The willow was harvested using a traditional method of <unk> , where a tree would be cut back to the main stem . During the 1930s more than 3 @,@ 600 hectares ( 8 @,@ 900 acres ) of willow were being grown commercially on the Levels . Largely due to the displacement of baskets with plastic bags and cardboard boxes , the industry has severely declined since the 1950s . By the end of the 20th century only about 140 hectares ( 350 acres ) were grown commercially , near the villages of Burrowbridge , Westonzoyland and North Curry . The Somerset Levels is now the only area in the UK where basket willow is grown commercially . 
 Towns such as Castle Cary and Frome grew around the medieval weaving industry . Street developed as a centre for the production of woollen slippers and , later , boots and shoes , with C. & J. Clark establishing its headquarters in the town . C & J Clark 's shoes are no longer manufactured there as the work was transferred to lower @-@ wage areas , such as China and Asia . Instead , in 1993 , redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village , the first purpose @-@ built factory outlet in the UK . C & J Clark also had shoe factories , at one time at Bridgwater , Minehead , Westfield and Weston super Mare to provide employment outside the main summer tourist season , but those satellite sites were closed in the late 1980s , before the main site at Street . Dr. Martens shoes were also made in Somerset , by the Northampton @-@ based R. Griggs Group , using redundant skilled shoemakers from C & J Clark ; that work has also been transferred to Asia . 
 The county has a long tradition of supplying freestone and building stone . Quarries at Doulting supplied freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral . Bath stone is also widely used . Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century , as did Hans Price in the 19th century , but it was used long before then . It was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines , and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel , at locations in Wiltshire such as Box . Bath stone is still used on a reduced scale today , but more often as a cladding rather than a structural material . Further south , Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from Ham Hill , which is also widely used in the construction industry . Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement . Until the 1960s , Puriton had Blue Lias stone quarries , as did several other Polden villages . Its quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball , adjacent to the King 's Sedgemoor Drain . Its derelict , early 20th century remains , was removed when the M5 motorway was constructed in the mid @-@ 1970s . Since the 1920s , the county has supplied aggregates . Foster Yeoman is Europe 's large supplier of limestone aggregates , with quarries at <unk> Quarry . It has a dedicated railway operation , Mendip Rail , which is used to transport aggregates by rail from a group of Mendip quarries . 
 Tourism is a major industry , estimated in 2001 to support around 23 @,@ 000 people . Attractions include the coastal towns , part of the Exmoor National Park , the West Somerset Railway ( a heritage railway ) , and the museum of the Fleet Air Arm at RNAS Yeovilton . The town of Glastonbury has mythical associations , including legends of a visit by the young Jesus of Nazareth and Joseph of Arimathea , with links to the Holy Grail , King Arthur , and Camelot , identified by some as Cadbury Castle , an Iron Age hill fort . Glastonbury also gives its name to an annual open @-@ air rock festival held in nearby Pilton . There are show caves open to visitors in the Cheddar Gorge , as well as its locally produced cheese , although there is now only one remaining cheese maker in the village of Cheddar . 
 In November 2008 , a public sector inward investment organisation was launched , called Into Somerset , with the intention of growing the county 's economy by promoting it to businesses that may wish to relocate from other parts of the UK ( especially London ) and the world . 
 = = = Nuclear electricity = = = 
 Hinkley Point C nuclear power station is a project to construct a 3 @,@ 200 MW two reactor nuclear power station . On 18 October 2010 , the British government announced that Hinkley Point – already the site of the disused Hinkley Point A and the still operational Hinkley Point B power stations – was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations . <unk> Generation Company , a subsidiary of EDF , submitted an application for development consent to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on 31 October 2011 . A protest group , Stop Hinkley , was formed to campaign for the closure of Hinkley Point B and oppose any expansion at the Hinkley Point site . In December 2013 , the European Commission opened an investigation to assess whether the project breaks state @-@ aid rules . On 8 October 2014 it was announced that the European Commission has approved the project , with an overwhelming majority and only four commissioners voting against the decision .

 In the 2001 census the population of the Somerset County Council area was 498 @,@ 093 with 169 @,@ 040 in Bath and North East Somerset , and 188 @,@ 564 in North Somerset giving a total for the ceremonial county of 855 @,@ 697 . 
 Population growth is higher than the national average , with a 6 @.@ 4 % increase , in the Somerset County Council area , since 1991 , and a 17 % increase since 1981 . The population density is 1 @.@ 4 persons per hectare , which can be compared to 2 @.@ 07 persons per hectare for the South West region . Within the county , population density ranges 0 @.@ 5 in West Somerset to 2 @.@ 2 persons per hectare in Taunton Deane . The percentage of the population who are economically active is higher than the regional and national average , and the unemployment rate is lower than the regional and national average . 
 Somerset has a high indigenous British population , with 98 @.@ 8 % registering as white British and 92 @.@ 4 % of these as born in the United Kingdom . Chinese is the largest ethnic group , while the black minority ethnic proportion of the total population is 2 @.@ 9 % . Over 25 % of Somerset 's population is concentrated in Taunton , Bridgwater and Yeovil . The rest of the county is rural and sparsely populated . Over 9 million tourist nights are spent in Somerset each year , which significantly increases the population at peak times . 
 = = Politics = = 
 The county is divided into nine constituencies , each returning one Member of Parliament ( MP ) to the House of Commons . In the May 2015 general election , all nine constituencies of the county elected Conservative MPs . The current constituencies of Somerset are Bridgwater and West Somerset , North East Somerset , North Somerset , Bath , Somerton and Frome , Taunton Deane , Wells , Yeovil , and Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare . 
 Residents of Somerset also form part of the electorate for the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament . 
 = = Local government = = 
 The ceremonial county of Somerset consists of a two @-@ tier non @-@ metropolitan county , which is administered by Somerset County Council and five district councils , and two unitary authority areas ( whose councils combine the functions of a county and a district ) . The five districts of Somerset are West Somerset , South Somerset , Taunton Deane , Mendip , and Sedgemoor . The two unitary authorities — which were established on 1 April 1996 following the break @-@ up of the short @-@ lived county of Avon — are North Somerset , and Bath & North East Somerset . 
 These unitary authorities formed part of the administrative county of Somerset before the creation of Avon ( a county created to cover Bristol and its environs in north Somerset and south Gloucestershire ) in 1974 . Bath however was a largely independent county borough during the existence of the administrative county of Somerset ( from 1889 to 1974 ) . 
 In 2007 , proposals to abolish the five district councils in favour of a unitary authority ( covering the existing two @-@ tier county ) were rejected following local opposition . West Somerset is the least populous district ( except for the two sui generis districts ) in England . 
 = = = Civil parishes = = = 
 Almost all of the county is covered by the lowest / most local form of English local government , the civil parish , with either a town or parish council ( a city council in the instance of Wells ) or a parish meeting ; some parishes group together , with a single council or meeting for the group . The city of Bath ( the area of the former county borough ) and much of the town of Taunton are unparished areas . 
 = = Emergency services = = 
 All of the ceremonial county of Somerset is covered by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary , a police force which also covers Bristol and South Gloucestershire . The police force is governed by the elected Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner . The Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service was formed in 2007 upon the merger of the Somerset Fire and Rescue Service with its neighbouring Devon service ; it covers the area of Somerset County Council as well as the entire ceremonial county of Devon . The unitary districts of North Somerset and Bath & North East Somerset are instead covered by the Avon Fire and Rescue Service , a service which also covers Bristol and South Gloucestershire . The South Western Ambulance Service covers the entire South West of England , including all of Somerset ; prior to February 2013 the unitary districts of Somerset came under the Great Western Ambulance Service , which merged into South Western . The Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance is a charitable organisation based in the county . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Somerset has traditions of art , music and literature . Wordsworth and Coleridge wrote while staying in Coleridge Cottage , Nether Stowey . The writer Evelyn Waugh spent his last years in the village of Combe Florey . The novelist John Cowper Powys ( 1872 @-@ 1963 ) lived in the Somerset village of Montacute from 1885 until 1894 and his novels Wood and Stone ( 1915 ) and A Glastonbury Romance ( 1932 ) are set in Somerset . 
 Traditional folk music , both song and dance , was important in the agricultural communities . Somerset songs were collected by Cecil Sharp and incorporated into works such as Holst 's A Somerset Rhapsody . Halsway Manor near Williton is an international centre for folk music . The tradition continues today with groups such as The Wurzels specialising in <unk> and Western music . 
 The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts takes place most years in Pilton , near Shepton Mallet , attracting over 170 @,@ 000 music and culture lovers from around the world to see world @-@ famous entertainers . The Big Green Gathering which grew out of the Green fields at the Glastonbury Festival is held in the Mendip Hills between Charterhouse and Compton Martin each summer . The annual Bath Literature Festival is one of several local festivals in the county ; others include the Frome Festival and the Trowbridge Village Pump Festival , which , despite its name , is held at Farleigh Hungerford in Somerset . The annual circuit of West Country Carnivals is held in a variety of Somerset towns during the autumn , forming a major regional festival , and the largest Festival of Lights in Europe . 
 In Arthurian legend , Avalon became associated with Glastonbury Tor when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have discovered the bones of King Arthur and his queen . What is more certain is that Glastonbury was an important religious centre by 700 and claims to be " the oldest above @-@ ground Christian church in the World " situated " in the mystical land of Avalon . " The claim is based on dating the founding of the community of monks at AD 63 , the year of the legendary visit of Joseph of Arimathea , who was supposed to have brought the Holy Grail . During the Middle Ages there were also important religious sites at Woodspring Priory and Muchelney Abbey . The present Diocese of Bath and Wells covers Somerset – with the exception of the Parish of Abbots Leigh with Leigh Woods in North Somerset – and a small area of Dorset . The Episcopal seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells is now in the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew in the city of Wells , having previously been at Bath Abbey . Before the English Reformation , it was a Roman Catholic diocese ; the county now falls within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton . The Benedictine monastery Saint Gregory 's Abbey , commonly known as Downside Abbey , is at Stratton @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Fosse , and the ruins of the former Cistercian Cleeve Abbey are near the village of Washford . 
 The county has several museums ; those at Bath include the American Museum in Britain , the Museum of Bath Architecture , the Herschel Museum of Astronomy , the Jane Austen Centre , and the Roman Baths . Other visitor attractions which reflect the cultural heritage of the county include : Claverton Pumping Station , Dunster Working Watermill , the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton , Nunney Castle , The Helicopter Museum in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare , King John 's Hunting Lodge in Axbridge , Blake Museum Bridgwater , Radstock Museum , Museum of Somerset in Taunton , the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury , and Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum . 
 Somerset has 11 @,@ 500 listed buildings , 523 scheduled monuments , 192 conservation areas , 41 parks and gardens including those at Barrington Court , Holnicote Estate , Prior Park Landscape Garden and Tintinhull Garden , 36 English Heritage sites and 19 National Trust sites , including Clevedon Court , Fyne Court , Montacute House and Tyntesfield as well as Stembridge Tower Mill , the last remaining thatched windmill in England . Other historic houses in the county which have remained in private ownership or used for other purposes include Halswell House and Marston Bigot . A key contribution of Somerset architecture is its medieval church towers . Jenkins writes , " These structures , with their buttresses , bell @-@ opening tracery and crowns , rank with Nottinghamshire alabaster as England 's finest contribution to medieval art . " 
 Bath Rugby play at the Recreation Ground in Bath , and the Somerset County Cricket Club are based at the County Ground in Taunton . The county gained its first Football League club in 2003 , when Yeovil Town won promotion to Division Three as Football Conference champions . They had achieved numerous FA Cup victories over football League sides in the past 50 years , and since joining the elite they have won promotion again — as League Two champions in 2005 . They came close to yet another promotion in 2007 , when they reached the League One playoff final , but lost to Blackpool at the newly reopened Wembley Stadium . Yeovil achieved promotion to the Championship in 2013 after beating Brentford in the playoff final . Horse racing courses are at Taunton and Wincanton . 
 In addition to English national newspapers the county is served by the regional Western Daily Press and local newspapers including : The Weston & Somerset Mercury , the Bath Chronicle , Chew Valley Gazette , Somerset County Gazette , Clevedon Mercury Mendip Times , and the " West Somerset Free Press . Television and radio are provided by BBC Somerset , Heart West Country , The Breeze ( Yeovil & South Somerset ) Yeovil , and HTV , now known as ITV Wales & West Ltd , but still commonly referred to as HTV . 
 The Flag of Somerset , representing the ceremonial county , has been registered with the Flag Institute following a competition in July 2013 . 
 = = Transport = = 
 Somerset has 6 @,@ 531 km ( 4 @,@ 058 mi ) of roads . The main arterial routes , which include the M5 motorway , A303 , A37 , A38 , A39 , A358 and A361 give good access across the county , but many areas can only be accessed via narrow country lanes . 
 Rail services are provided by the West of England Main Line through Yeovil Junction , the Bristol to Exeter Line , Heart of Wessex Line which runs from Bristol Temple Meads to Weymouth and the Reading to Taunton Line . The key train operator for Somerset is First Great Western , and other services are operated by South West Trains and CrossCountry . 
 Bristol Airport , located in North Somerset , provides national and international air services . 
 The Somerset Coal Canal was built in the early 19th century to reduce the cost of transportation of coal and other heavy produce . The first 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) , running from a junction with the Kennet and Avon Canal , along the Cam valley , to a terminal basin at Paulton , were in use by 1805 , together with several tramways . A planned 11 @.@ 7 km ( 7 @.@ 3 mi ) branch to Midford was never built , but in 1815 a tramway was laid along its towing path . In 1871 the tramway was purchased by the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway ( S & DJR ) , and operated until the 1950s . 
 The 19th century saw improvements to Somerset 's roads with the introduction of turnpikes , and the building of canals and railways . Nineteenth @-@ century canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal , Westport Canal , Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal . The Dorset and Somerset Canal was proposed , but little of it was ever constructed and it was abandoned in 1803 . 
 The usefulness of the canals was short @-@ lived , though some have now been restored for recreation . The 19th century also saw the construction of railways to and through Somerset . The county was served by five pre @-@ 1923 Grouping railway companies : the Great Western Railway ( GWR ) ; a branch of the Midland Railway ( MR ) to Bath Green Park ( and another one to Bristol ) ; the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway , and the London and South Western Railway ( L & SWR ) . The former main lines of the GWR are still in use today , although many of its branch lines were scrapped under the notorious Beeching Axe . The former lines of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway closed completely , as has the branch of the Midland Railway to Bath Green Park ( and to Bristol St Philips ) ; however , the L & SWR survived as a part of the present West of England Main Line . None of these lines , in Somerset , are electrified . Two branch lines , the West and East Somerset Railways , were rescued and transferred back to private ownership as " heritage " lines . The fifth railway was a short @-@ lived light railway , the Weston , Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway . The West Somerset Mineral Railway carried the iron ore from the Brendon Hills to Watchet . 
 Until the 1960s the piers at Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare , Clevedon , Portishead and Minehead were served by the paddle steamers of P and A Campbell who ran regular services to Barry and Cardiff as well as Ilfracombe and Lundy Island . The pier at Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea was used for commercial goods , one of the reasons for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was to provide a link between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel . The pier at Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea is the shortest pier in the UK . In the 1970s the Royal Portbury Dock was constructed to provide extra capacity for the Port of Bristol . 
 For long @-@ distance holiday traffic travelling through the county to and from Devon and Cornwall , Somerset is often regarded as a marker on the journey . North – south traffic moves through the county via the M5 Motorway . Traffic to and from the east travels either via the A303 road , or the M4 Motorway , which runs east – west , crossing the M5 just beyond the northern limits of the county . 
 = = Education = = 
 State schools in Somerset are provided by three local education authorities : Bath and North East Somerset , North Somerset , and the larger Somerset County Council . All state schools are comprehensive . In some areas primary , infant and junior schools cater for ages four to eleven , after which the pupils move on to secondary schools . There is a three @-@ tier system of first , middle and upper schools in the Cheddar Valley , and in West Somerset , while most other schools in the county use the two @-@ tier system . Somerset has 30 state and 17 independent secondary schools ; Bath and North East Somerset has 13 state and 5 independent secondary schools ; and North Somerset has 10 state and 2 independent secondary schools , excluding sixth form colleges . 
 Some of the county 's secondary schools have specialist school status . Some schools have sixth forms and others transfer their sixth formers to colleges . Several schools can trace their origins back many years , such as The Blue School in Wells and Richard Huish College in Taunton . Others have changed their names over the years such as <unk> Cliff School which was started in 1905 as the City of Bath Boys ' School and changed to its present name in 1972 when the grammar school was amalgamated with a local secondary modern school , to form a comprehensive school . Many others were established and built since the Second World War . In 2006 , 5 @,@ 900 pupils in Somerset sat GCSE examinations , with 44 @.@ 5 % achieving 5 grades A @-@ C including English and Maths ( compared to 45 @.@ 8 % for England ) . 
 <unk> 's School is a state boarding school in Bruton that also takes day pupils from the surrounding area . The Somerset LEA also provides special schools such as Newbury Manor School , which caters for children aged between 10 and 17 with special educational needs . Provision for pupils with special educational needs is also made by the mainstream schools . 
 There is also a range of independent or public schools . Many of these are for pupils between 11 and 18 years , such as King 's College , Taunton and Taunton School . King 's School , Bruton , was founded in 1519 and received royal foundation status around 30 years later in the reign of Edward VI . Millfield is the largest co @-@ educational boarding school . There are also preparatory schools for younger children , such as All Hallows , and <unk> Preparatory School . Chilton <unk> School offers places both to day pupils and boarders aged 7 to 16 . Other schools provide education for children from the age of 3 or 4 years through to 18 , such as King Edward 's School , Bath , Queen 's College , Taunton and Wells Cathedral School which is one of the five established musical schools for school @-@ age children in Britain . Some of these schools have religious affiliations , such as Monkton Combe School , Prior Park College , <unk> School which is associated with the Religious Society of Friends , Downside School which is a Roman Catholic public school in Stratton @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Fosse , situated next to the Benedictine Downside Abbey , and Kingswood School , which was founded by John Wesley in 1748 in Kingswood near Bristol , originally for the education of the sons of the itinerant ministers ( clergy ) of the Methodist Church .

 = Cyclone Gene = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Gene was the deadliest storm as well as the most damaging tropical cyclone of the 2007 – 08 South Pacific cyclone season east of <unk> . RSMC Nadi monitored Gene as the 12th tropical disturbance , as well as the fourth tropical cyclone and the third severe tropical cyclone to form west of <unk> during the 2007 – 08 South Pacific cyclone season . Gene was also recognised by RSMC Nadi as the fifth tropical cyclone and fourth severe tropical cyclone to form within the South Pacific Ocean during the 2007 @-@ 08 season . 
 On January 25 , a tropical disturbance formed within the Fijian Archipelago and was designated as Tropical Disturbance 12F . The next day it was upgraded to a tropical depression , whilst on January 27 , RSMC Nadi named the depression as Cyclone Gene . Later that day Gene made landfall on Fiji , and caused 8 deaths and $ 51 million ( 2008 , F $ ) . Cyclone Gene then slowly intensified to a category three cyclone on both the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale and the Australian Cyclone Intensity Scale . Gene then took a turn to the south moving towards 25 ° S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi 's area of responsibility with the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre ( TCWC ) in Wellington , New Zealand . Gene then crossed 25 ° S on February 3 and Nadi released their final advisory . Cyclone Gene continued as a Tropical Cyclone for three days before becoming an extratropical cyclone . Early on February 6 TCWC Wellington released their final advisory on tropical cyclone Gene as they declared it as extratropical . 
 Cyclone Gene caused widespread damage to several of Fiji 's main islands , including Viti Levu , Vanua Levu , Taveuni , Yasawa , Mamanuca , and other outlying island groups , while killing a total of 8 people . The cyclone also caused severe damage to Vanautu 's Futuna island after its outerbands lashed the island with gale force windspeeds and heavy rain for 12 hours .

 On January 26 , the Fiji Meteorological Service 's Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi , Fiji and the United States Armed Forces Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to monitor a weak tropical disturbance that had developed within the monsoon trough about 290 km ( 180 mi ) to the northeast of the Fijian dependency of Rotuma . The disturbance initially moved towards the southeast before it recurved and started to move towards the southwest and Fiji during the next day , while gradually developing further in an area of low vertical windshear . At 1800 UTC on January 27 , the JTWC reported that the disturbance had developed into Tropical Cyclone 15P and started to issue warnings on it as the 1 @-@ minute windspeeds had become equivalent to a tropical storm . Over the next 6 – 12 hours , the disturbance moved towards the southwest and hugged Vanua Levu 's southeastern coast , under the influence of a mid level ridge of high pressure that was located to the southeast of the system . 15P 's development was hindered while it was located over land , however it did not weaken significantly because it was located in an area of favourable upper level conditions . 
 While over land the system moved towards the south @-@ southwest and moved into the Bligh Waters , where it started to rapidly intensify as convection erupted around the system . As a result , before the system made landfall on Viti Levu , RSMC Nadi reported that the system had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone , on the Australian intensity scale and named it Gene . The system then made landfall shortly after 0600 UTC near Lautoka , before it started to move westwards and passed near Nadi before it moved out of the archipelago . Early on January 29 as the system moved westwards , RSMC Nadi reported that Gene had intensified into a category two tropical cyclone before it briefly weakened into a Category 1 because of the effects of a moderate amount of vertical windshear . However , the system quickly reintensified and by 1200 UTC the next day had become a category 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone and equivalent to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . 
 On January 31 , while the storm was moving closer to Vanuatu , Gene attained peak winds of 150 km / h ( 95 <unk> min ) & 185 km / h ( 115 mph 1 @-@ min ) Thus , Cyclone Gene was a Category 3 cyclone on the Australian scale and the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . 
 During February 1 , as Cyclone Gene was moving to the west , Gene recurved and started moving towards the south and missed Vanuatu . The next day cyclone Gene started to temporarily weaken again by becoming a category two cyclone with winds speeds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph 10 min ) . This came as cyclone Gene approached 25 ° S which marks the edge of RSMC Nadi 's area of responsibility , to the south of 25 ° S the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre ( TCWC ) in Wellington , New Zealand monitors tropical cyclones , south of 25 ° S. As Gene crossed in to TCWC Wellington 's area of responsibility , Cyclone Gene started to re @-@ intensify becoming a severe tropical cyclone again with peak winds of 120 km / h ( 105 mph 10 min ) however this re @-@ intensification only lasted for 12 hours before Gene began to weaken for the final time by becoming a tropical cyclone that day . Gene slowly weakened over the next couple of days as it moved towards the south east . The JTWC then issued its final warning on February 6 as Cyclone Gene was finishing its extratropical transition , and had also become fully embedded within the baroclinic zone . TCWC Wellington continued to monitor the extratropical remnants of Gene until February 9 , after the sustained windspeeds had dropped to below 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) .

 On January 27 , RSMC Nadi issued strong wind warnings for Fiji , as 12F was expected to affect Fiji but not develop into a tropical cyclone until it had moved out of the archipelago . However , as 12F rapidly developed into a tropical cyclone during that day , RSMC Nadi was forced to issue gale force wind warnings for various parts of Fiji including Vanua Levu , Viti Levu , <unk> , Vatulele , <unk> , Yasawa and Mamanuca . 
 When Cyclone Gene hit Fiji , it caused widespread minor damage on both of the main islands of Fiji including Vanua Levu and Viti Levu as well as a few of the other minor islands in Fiji which included Taveuni & the Yasawa group of islands . Power cuts were reported in at least half of Fiji including Suva and Nadi however power was quickly restored to these areas . Within Fiji over 340 people evacuated to 61 evacuation centres which were opened by the Fijian government . There was also 61 houses completely flattened by cyclone Gene . 
 The effects of Cyclone Gene were compounded by continuous heavy rainfall and subsequent floods in most parts of Viti Levu . As a result , there was significant disruption to water supplies , with several sources becoming contaminated and destroyed as a result there were several cases of Typhoid reported in Fiji with at least 1 person dying from typhoid . There was also seven other deaths from cyclone Gene , five of these were directly related whilst two people were also killed as an indirect result of Cyclone Gene from house fires while using candles to light their homes when the power went out . Within their end of season report RSMC Nadi reported that the total cost of Cyclone Gene was F $ 51 million ( 2008 ) , ( $ 35 million 2008 USD ) .

 After exiting the Fijian archipelago of islands , Cyclone Gene moved towards the west across the South Pacific , towards Vanuatu , and was predicted to affect the archipelago between January 31 and February 2 . However , during January 31 , the system started to re @-@ curve towards the southeast and as a result did not make landfall on the island , but Gene 's outerbands produced gale force winds and heavy rain on various southern Vanuatuan islands for about 12 hours . However the system only caused no deaths and severe damage to Futuna island , while sparing other nearby islands . On Futuna Island , Gene caused damages to buildings , Plants used for weaving and generating income , trails , native and non native homes , waterlines , food gardens , food producing plants , crops , and other critical structures and littered footpaths with fallen trees and debris . As a result of damages to waterlines from falling debris , flooding and contaminated drinking water were reported in some villages with pipes openly leaking . After an aerial survey found that more than 70 % of garden crops had been damaged by Gene , the Vanuatu Government declared Futuna island a disaster zone .

 Drakengard is an action role @-@ playing game developed by Cavia for the PlayStation 2 . It was published in Japan ( on September 11 , 2003 ) and North America ( March 2 , 2004 ) by Square Enix and in European territories ( May 21 , 2004 ) by Take @-@ Two Interactive . A Europe @-@ exclusive mobile phone adaptation was co @-@ developed and co @-@ published by Square Enix and <unk> for Vodafone devices in August 2004 . 
 The game is the first installment of the Drakengard series and features a mixture of ground @-@ based hack @-@ and @-@ slash , aerial combat , and role @-@ playing elements which have become a staple of the series . The story is set during a religious war between two factions — the Union and the Empire — with the war tipping in favor of the Empire . The player controls Caim , a deposed prince of the Union , in his quest for vengeance against the Empire . Wounded in battle while protecting his sister Furiae , he is forced to make a pact with a red dragon named Angelus . As they journey together , they join with Hierarch Verdelet on a quest to prevent the Empire from destroying magical seals that keep the world in balance : Furiae acts as the central seal , and her death will drop the world into chaos . 
 Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki conceived the game as a hybrid between the popular Dynasty Warriors series and Namco 's aerial combat game Ace Combat . It was Shiba 's first project as a producer . The dark story was created by director Taro Yoko and Sawako Natori , who wrote the majority of the script . The music was written by Nobuyoshi Sano and Takayuki Aihara . Drakengard sold well in Japan and received mixed to positive reviews in the west : reviewers praised the game 's story and music , but were mixed about the graphics and criticized the gameplay for being repetitive . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Drakengard is an action role @-@ playing game featuring three types of gameplay : ground missions , aerial missions , and Free Expedition Mode . The gameplay modes are called Ground Mode , <unk> Mode , and Air Mode . In some levels , players can switch between ground @-@ based and aerial combat . Ground @-@ based gameplay primarily has the player controlling the main protagonist , Caim . He has access to three types of attack : a standard sword @-@ slash , a magic attack and a dash attack that throws enemies to the ground . Additional weapons can be accessed and swapped via the menu . Weapons gain experience levels through use , dealing more damage as a result . Each has a four @-@ level cap . The player can access up to eight weapons during a mission . Pressing the attack button repeatedly while in combat with enemy units triggers combos , and pressing another button mid @-@ combo will trigger a special attack which will temporarily incapacitate enemy units in the immediate area . The player can also temporarily switch between Caim and an assigned ally , who shares similar attacks but deals more damage . These allies are gained in optional levels and can only be summoned a limited number of times . 
 In aerial combat missions , players control Caim 's dragon partner Angelus . During these moments , players are directed against multiple aerial targets that must be destroyed in order to win . As Angelus gains experience points through combat , she levels up and is able to do more damage – similar to the weapons used in ground @-@ based combat . Boss battles are all located in these aerial stages . Angelus has access to two types of standard fire attacks : a free @-@ aim blast that causes high damage , and homing bolts that can hit multiple targets but do less damage . Homing shots can be dodged or countered by some enemy types later in the game . Angelus can also perform a special area @-@ affecting magical attack that damages or kills multiple enemy units . She can be used to quickly traverse battle areas during primarily ground @-@ based missions . Players can summon Angelus during certain ground @-@ based missions and play her in <unk> Mode . Controls are identical to ground @-@ based combat . Pressing the select button causes Caim to dismount Angelus . Caim and Angelus level up during combat in different ways : as Caim levels up , their shared health meter grows , while Angelus ' leveling increases the damage her attacks do to enemy units . 
 Players can navigate the game world and select missions via a world map accessed between levels . While playing , a mini @-@ map allows the player to see enemy locations , and a full @-@ screen map can be switched to that covers the entire area and shows mission objectives . Drakengard 's levels are called verses , and the verses are grouped across thirteen chapters . Each level has a time limit of one hour for players to complete them . Normal levels are numbered , while additional levels are marked by Roman numerals . The game features five endings : the normal ending and four additional endings which are unlocked when certain conditions are met , such as completing optional chapters or obtaining powerful weapons .

 = = = Setting and characters = = = 
 Drakengard takes place in a medieval dark fantasy world called Midgard . The world is protected from falling into chaos by the Seals , objects magically linked to a woman chosen as the Goddess of the Seal . If the seals and the Goddess were destroyed , malevolent beings known as the Watchers would enter the world to destroy humanity . A key element of the world is the ability for a human and a beast to form a pact , a ritual that ties their souls together and grants great power . Their lives become bound by the pact , and the human pays a price for it in the form of some attribute ( e.g. their voice , their eyesight or their ability to age ) . During the events of Drakengard , the Union , which protects the Seals , is in the midst of a religious war with the Empire , a power led by a cult who believe that destroying the seals will bring them good fortune . 
 The main characters are Caim ( <unk> , Kaimu ) , a deposed prince of the Union , and Angelus ( <unk> , <unk> , lit . " Angel " ) , a red dragon . Joining Caim and Angelus are Leonard ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a hermit who loses his brothers in an attack by the Empire ; Arioch ( <unk> , <unk> ) , an elf woman driven mad by the murder of her family ; Seere ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a young boy from the Empire whose village was destroyed by their forces ; and Verdelet ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a priest in charge of protecting the Goddess Seal . Other prominent characters are Furiae ( <unk> , Furiae ) , Caim 's sister and the current Goddess of the Seal ; Inuart ( <unk> , <unk> ) , Furiae 's former fiance ; and Manah ( <unk> , Mana ) , Seere 's sister , leader of the enemy cult and the game 's main antagonist . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Drakengard opens with Caim in the midst of a battle to protect his sister from the Empire . During the battle , Caim is injured , and going to Furiae 's castle finds Angelus severely wounded from torture . Despite their mutual mistrust , Caim and Angelus agree to make a pact and save each other . After repelling the attack , Furiae and Inuart go with Caim to find safety , encountering Verdelet on their travels . Eventually , Furiae and Inuart are captured by the Empire , and Inuart is tortured and brainwashed by Manah . Verdelet and Caim travel to each of the three Seals , but each time arrive too late to stop them being destroyed . Along the way , Caim and Verdelet are joined by Leonard and Seere , and take along Arioch to protect others from her madness . Eventually , the Union and the Empire engage in battle and the Union are victorious . After the battle , however , the Union 's surviving troops are decimated by an unknown force and the Empire 's troops return to life . Caim and Angelus travel to a fortress that has appeared in the sky , where they find that Furiae has killed herself , breaking the final seal . Inuart , seeing her body , is released from his brainwashing and takes her away . Returning to the Imperial capital , Caim and Angelus confront Manah , eventually doing battle with her . Defeated , Manah asks them to kill her , but Angelus declares that she must live with her crimes . Angelus then offers herself as the new Goddess of the Seal for Caim 's sake . As Verdelet performs the ritual , Angelus tells Caim her name before fading away . 
 Subsequent playthroughs and extra chapters reveal further details about the characters . Leonard 's self @-@ imposed seclusion is because he was trying to suppress his pedophilia , and the guilt at his brothers ' deaths stems from the fact that he gave in to his cravings and left them unprotected . Arioch 's madness takes the form of cannibalism of children , in the belief that they would be safe from harm within her . Furiae is also revealed to feel romantic love for Caim , which led to Inuart becoming jealous and vulnerable to Manah 's influence . During the events leading to the third ending , Manah reveals Furiae 's feelings for Caim , who shows revulsion at the revelation : due to this and the Watchers ' influence , Furiae stabs herself . Manah was abused by her and Seere 's mother , but Seere was never subjected to the abuse , leading him to feel guilty . The abuse Manah received and her longing for love eventually drove her insane , and she was chosen to become the Watchers ' agent . 
 There are four possible alternative endings . In the second ending , Inuart uses a magical object called a " Seed of Resurrection " to resurrect Furiae : while successful , the Seed turns her into a monster , and she kills Inuart . Caim is forced to kill her , but not before clones of her are produced from other Seeds to destroy humanity . In the third ending , after Furiae 's suicide , Caim and Angelus stop Inuart 's attempt to resurrect her and confront Manah , who is killed by another dragon . With the dragons now being driven to destroy mankind , Angelus breaks her pact with Caim and fights him to the death . Caim then prepares to die fighting the other dragons . In the fourth ending , after the group save Furiae and see the extent of Manah 's madness , Seere has his Golem pact partner kill Manah . Caim , Seere , Leonard and Arioch escape from the collapsing fortress , while Inuart and Furiae are killed inside . With Manah dead , the Watchers descend on the Imperial capital , and during the fight against them , Arioch and Leonard are killed . A giant queen monster appears in the city that kills Caim and Angelus , and Seere uses his powers to seal the city and the Watchers in a timeless zone for eternity , nullifying their threat . In the fifth ending , Caim and Angelus attack the queen and the three disappear through a portal . After engaging the queen monster in a rhythm game in modern @-@ day Tokyo , the two destroy it , and are then shot down by a fighter jet . This ending leads into the events of Nier 
 = = Development = = 
 The original idea for Drakengard originated between Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki when they were working at Cavia . It was conceived as an aerial battle game similar to Ace Combat . The four @-@ year development was Shiba 's first project as a producer . The team developing the game went under the moniker of " Project <unk> " . As development progressed , ground @-@ based battles were also incorporated after the success in Japan of Dynasty Warriors 2 . Creating the change from ground to aerial gameplay was exceptionally difficult for the team as they encountered problems with the PlayStation 2 hardware . Jun Iwasaki , president and chief executive officer of Square Enix USA , described Drakengard as a " perfect hybrid of genres " , citing its story and gameplay as reasons why it would be enjoyed by players who wanted a " deeper action game " . Speaking in 2013 , Shiba commented that Cavia had been inexperienced in creating action games , and as such it was not up to the standards of its contemporaries . The game 's battle scenes were inspired by films such as the 1999 version of The Mummy and its spin @-@ off The Scorpion King , as well as films like Dragonheart and epic films from Asia . Iwasaki was unable to take up the position of director because of other projects he was involved with : the position instead went to Taro Yoko . 
 During production , the team were asked to make multiple adjustments and changes to its content by Drakengard 's advisory board . It was annoying enough for Yoko that he decided at the time not to make another Drakengard . Drakengard was first shown off to the western public at E3 2003 . It underwent multiple changes for its western release . The original title , Drag @-@ On Dragoon , was chosen for its sound , but was not considered right for the western market . Because of this , it was changed to Drakengard . In addition , some of the more mature themes , such as references to incest and sexual taboos , were censored in the western localization . It also underwent major debugging and an alteration in the angle of the in @-@ game camera before its European release . While Square Enix published the title in Japan and North America , Take @-@ Two Interactive was chosen to publish it in European territories . The mobile port was part of Square Enix 's plans to branch out into the European mobile game market . It was co @-@ developed with London @-@ based mobile developer <unk> as part of a collaboration between Square Enix and Vodafone , designed to function on the Vodafone live ! service . It was first released in Germany , then made available in the United Kingdom , Spain and Italy . 
 = = = World design = = = 
 The setting , mythos and landscape were primarily inspired by the folklore of Northern Europe , while other elements drew from Japanese @-@ style revisionism . According to Shiba , multiple elements of the story and world were created to be dark , sad and serious in tone , in contrast to the likes of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy . One of the core narrative threads , involving romantic feelings between siblings , was inspired in Yoko 's mind by the anime series Sister Princess . Another series that inspired the team was Neon Genesis Evangelion , with a comparison being drawn between them due to a shared trait : while having standard premises , darker narrative elements were hidden in its content . The central narrative theme was " Immorality " , which was mostly demonstrated by writer Sawako Natori through the characters . Multiple endings were made because Yoko was told that the game would not have a sequel . The characters ' stories were created by Yoko and Iwasaki , who independently created the character backgrounds : Yoko took charge of Seere , Leonard and Arioch , while Iwasaki was involved in developing Verdelet , Inuart and Caim . In an interview concerning her role in the game , Natori admitted to feeling embarrassed by her writing when hearing Sota Murakami and Natsuki Yamashita , who voiced Seere and Manah , speak their lines . 
 Caim , the main protagonist , was meant to be an examination of the typical action game hero , which Yoko felt should not have a happy ending in a story focused on violence . The nature of Caim and Angelus ' relationship underwent changes during development : Yoko had conceived their relationship as a parasitic one , but Iwasaki wanted to create a different type of romance , and so wrote the love story for the two of them . The actor who portrayed the two was Shinnosuke Ikehata : though originally cast for the role of Caim , his versatility also got him the role of Angelus . Inuart was originally designed as the main protagonist of Drakengard , with him being a " useless hero " . A pivotal scene in the game , where he first clashes with Caim , became one of the ways Yoko was able to properly project his vision of the game 's world . Furiae was designed by Yoko as both an explanation for Caim and Inuart 's rivalry , and as a representation of his distaste for the kind of forgettable character she represented . The relationship between Caim and Furiae , as well as their ultimate fates , was Yoko 's response to the standard happy ending found in most role @-@ playing games at the time , which he felt did not fit in with a protagonist who had killed hundreds during their quest . Caim and Furiae were respectively based around Guts from Berserk and Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion , with Caim being codenamed " Guts " during development . Verdelet was portrayed as the " despicable elder " , who cared for no @-@ one except himself : his personality was intended to be both ineffectual and bossy , even in the face of catastrophe . Manah 's role in Drakengard was designed to represent unloved children . The second ending was principally inspired by this and his dislike for Sister Princess . The fifth ending , a boss battle in modern @-@ day Tokyo , was created as a joke ending in the same vein as the Silent Hill series and an unexpected twist for players who were expecting an upbeat tone after the previous endings . This ending 's title was also a respective tribute to The End of Evangelion . 
 Character designs were done by Kimihiko Fujisaka . Drakengard was his first job as a character designer : his designs were firmly seated within the Medieval European aesthetic . To achieve this , he imagined that he had been sent back to that historical period . His designs were inspired by the character designs of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest . Caim was one of the earliest characters created for Drakengard . In Inuart 's design , Fujisaka incorporated heavy armor into his design to give a more forceful impression for players . His ultimate role and final design were based around the idea of him being Caim 's rival . The black dragons ' design did not impress Shiba , who considered cutting him from the final product . Manah 's red clothing was designed to evoke both its status as the game 's key color , and her status as the leader of the Cult of the Watchers . Shiba approved of the design , feeling that it contrasted nicely with Furiae 's predominantly white design . Fujisaka also helped design Furiae 's monster form for the game 's second ending . In hindsight , Fujisaka was dissatisfied with his work on Drakengard , particularly his work on Caim . The game 's monsters were designed by Taro Hasegawa . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music was composed by Nobuyoshi Sano and Takayuki Aihara : the two used excerpts from pieces of classical music ( selected by Aihara ) , then rearranged , remixed and layered them . Their main objective was to create music that emulated the gameplay , as well as the story and general narrative theme of " madness " . The music was intended to be " experimental " and " expressionistic " rather than " commercial " . The theme song , " Exhausted " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , was composed by Sano , written by Natori and sung by Eriko Hatsune . The soundtrack was originally released in two volumes under the names Drag @-@ On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.1 and Drag @-@ On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.2 , released on October 22 and November 21 , 2003 , respectively . The soundtrack was re @-@ released on April 20 , 2011 , as a two @-@ disc set under the title Drag @-@ On Dragoon Original Soundtrack .

 Drakengard sold more than 122 @,@ 000 units in its first week of release in Japan , taking Mobile Suit Gundam : Encounters in Space 's place at the top of the sales charts . By the end of 2003 , it had sold 241 @,@ 014 copies . Gaming magazine Famitsu ranked it as the 50th best @-@ selling title of 2003 , and sold well enough that it was made part of Square Enix 's Ultimate Hits series , re @-@ releases of popular titles . Its strong sales were attributed by the team to its cinematic story and similarity to the popular Dynasty Warriors series . In Europe , the game sold 110 @,@ 000 units by November 2004 . 
 According to GameSpot , Drakengard received favorable reviews in Japan . Famitsu gave it an overall score of 29 / 40 . After the game 's reveal at E3 , multiple video game publications , including Official PlayStation Magazine , IGN and Game Informer , praised its promising story and mixture of gameplay genres . The game received " average " reviews , according to video game review aggregator Metacritic . 
 The story received the highest amount of praise . IGN 's Jeremy Dunham called it the game 's " biggest strength " , praising the edgy themes explored and the balance between fantasy and realism . He also praised the multiple parallels with Neon Genesis Evangelion . The reviewer for Computer and Video Games ( CVG ) praised " the maturity and wit of the dialogue and unfolding plot " , noting that they stood alongside other Square Enix RPGs of the time . VideoGamer.com 's Adam Jarvis praised the game 's storytelling style , saying that while it became " a little bogged down at various points , it is deep enough to keep your interest throughout the game . " GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin said that " though the story itself is awkwardly paced and is sometimes difficult to keep up with , it becomes one of the main motivating factors for wanting to get all the way through to the end of the game . " 
 The graphics received mixed responses . Kasavin said the game " looks decent but , ultimately , not all that good " . He criticized the bland environments and awkward movements for enemy units and the playable character , but praised the design of the dragon . Game Informer was more positive , praising the graphical detail and cutscenes and the look of enemy units , despite finding pop @-@ up issues and framerate dips . Jarvis praised the design of the main cast , but cited the repetitive enemy design and dark environments as detracting elements . Dunham praised the character and monster designs as well as the full @-@ motion cutscenes , but was less impressed by the repetitive human enemy designs , bland environments and low draw distance . The full @-@ motion videos were also praised by the CVG reviewer . 
 Reaction to the sound design was mixed to positive . Dunham praised the majority of the British @-@ style voice acting , but called the music " disappointing " . Game Informer cited the low number of background tracks and voice acting " straight out of a renaissance festival " as poorer parts of the game . Kasavin praised the voice acting and called the music " the most nerve @-@ racking and most intense aspect of the game . " Jarvis was also positive , praising the sound design for battles , most of the voice acting and the music , which " [ helped ] create a suitably dark atmosphere . " 
 Reception of the gameplay was mixed to negative , with Dunham saying it suffered the same problems as its derivative games despite its easy entertainment value , while Jarvis called the options in gameplay " fairly limited " . The CVG reviewer praised the aerial segments of gameplay , calling them the most entertaining , and found that the standard combat served to embellish the protagonist 's " kick @-@ ass persona , making him more than just another anonymous dragon rider " . The main criticism was repetition in the gameplay . Kasavin was exceptionally critical , saying that the gameplay both made the process of playing laborious and detracted from the main story . Game Informer called the gameplay " fun , but [ lacking ] any semblance of depth . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Drakengard received two novelizations by Emi Nagashima ( writing as Jun Eishima ) and Takashi Aizawa . The game 's events were retold again in a special story titled Drakengard 1 @.@ 3 , which followed on from the spin @-@ off manga Drag @-@ On Dragoon : Shi ni Itaru Aka . In March 2014 , Hardcore Gamer 's <unk> Khan favorably referred to the game as a precursor to the TV adaptation of the book series A Song of Ice and Fire in its handling of taboo themes and violence . The game was considered successful enough in Japan by Square Enix that a sequel was commissioned . Drakengard 2 was again directed by Shiba , but Yoko was replaced as director by Akira Yasui , resulting in numerous thematic changes . The sequel takes place eighteen years after the events of Drakengard 's first ending . 
 An attempt to create another title in the series resulted in the spin @-@ off Nier , which retains links and themes from the main series . Nier takes place over a thousand years after the events of Drakengard 's fifth ending . When Cavia was absorbed by AQ Interactive after Nier 's release , a future attempt by Shiba to continue the series was unsuccessful . A prequel , Drakengard 3 , was released in 2013 , with multiple staff members returning to their original roles . 
 = Milk shark = 
 The milk shark ( Rhizoprionodon acutus ) is a species of requiem shark , and part of the family Carcharhinidae , whose common name comes from an Indian belief that consumption of its meat promotes lactation . The largest and most widely distributed member of its genus , the milk shark typically measures 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 @.@ 6 ft ) long , and can be found in coastal tropical waters throughout the eastern Atlantic and the Indo @-@ Pacific regions . Occurring from the surface to a depth of 200 m ( 660 ft ) , this species is common near beaches and in estuaries , and has been recorded swimming up rivers in Cambodia . Juveniles are known to inhabit tidal pools and seagrass meadows . The milk shark has a slender body with a long , pointed snout and large eyes , and is a nondescript gray above and white below . This shark can be distinguished from similar species in its range by the long furrows at the corners of its mouth , and seven to 15 enlarged pores just above them . 
 Among the most abundant sharks within its range , the milk shark feeds primarily on small bony fishes , but also takes cephalopods and crustaceans . In turn , it often falls prey to larger sharks and possibly marine mammals . In common with other members of its family , this species is viviparous , with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection . Females give birth to one to eight young either during a defined breeding season or throughout the year , depending on location . The reproductive cycle is usually annual , but may be biennial or triennial . Large numbers of milk sharks are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries for meat , fins , and fishmeal . Despite this , the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as being of Least Concern , because its wide distribution and relatively high productivity seemingly allow present levels of exploitation to be sustained . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The German naturalist Eduard Rüppell published the first scientific description of the milk shark , as Carcharias acutus ( the specific epithet means " sharp " in Latin ) , in his 1837 Fische des Rothen Meeres ( Fishes of the Red Sea ) . It has since been listed under several different genera , including Carcharhinus and Scoliodon , before finally being placed in the genus Rhizoprionodon via synonymization with the type species , R. <unk> . As Rüppell did not mention a type specimen , in 1960 , Wolfgang <unk> designated a 44 cm ( 17 in ) -long male caught off Jeddah , Saudi Arabia as the lectotype for this species . 
 The common name " milk shark " comes from a belief held in India that eating this shark 's meat enhances lactation . Other names for this species include fish shark , grey dog shark , little blue shark , Longmans <unk> , milk dog shark , sharp @-@ nosed ( milk ) shark , <unk> 's sharp @-@ nosed shark , and white @-@ eye shark . A 1992 phylogenetic analysis by Gavin Naylor , based on allozymes , found that the milk shark is the most basal of the four Rhizoprionodon species examined . The extinct R. <unk> , known from Middle Miocene ( 16 – 12 Ma ) deposits in southern France and Portugal , may be the same as R. acutus . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The milk shark has the widest distribution of any Rhizoprionodon species . In the eastern Atlantic Ocean , it is found from Mauritania to Angola , as well as around Madeira and in the Gulf of Taranto off southern Italy . In the Indian Ocean , it occurs from South Africa and Madagascar northward to the Arabian Peninsula , and eastward to South and Southeast Asia . In the Pacific Ocean , this species occurs from China and southern Japan , through the Philippines and Indonesia , to New Guinea and northern Australia . The milk shark likely once had a contiguous distribution by way of the Tethys Sea , until during the Miocene epoch , when eastern Atlantic sharks were isolated from Indo @-@ Pacific sharks by the collision of Asia and Africa . 
 Occurring close to shore from the surf zone to a depth of 200 m ( 660 ft ) , the milk shark favors turbid water off sandy beaches and occasionally enters estuaries . In Shark Bay , Western Australia , juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of <unk> antarctica and Posidonia australis . Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities , it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia , as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap . Milk sharks may be found anywhere in the water column from the surface to the bottom . Off KwaZulu @-@ Natal , South Africa , its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer , suggesting some form of seasonal movement .

 The largest member of its genus , off West Africa the milk shark has been reported to reach 1 @.@ 78 m ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) and 22 kg ( 49 lb ) for males , and 1 @.@ 65 m ( 5 @.@ 4 ft ) and 17 kg ( 37 lb ) for females , though there is uncertainty regarding the species identity of these specimens . Even if accepted , these figures are considered exceptional and most individuals do not exceed 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 @.@ 6 ft ) in length . Generally , females are heavier and attain a greater maximum size than males . 
 The milk shark has a slender build with a long , pointed snout , large , round eyes with nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) , and no spiracles . On each side of the head behind the corner of the jaw , there are usually seven to 15 enlarged pores . The nostrils are small , as are the adjacent triangular skin flaps . There are long furrows at the corners of the mouth on both the upper and lower jaws . The tooth rows number 24 – 25 in both jaws . The upper teeth are finely serrated and strongly oblique ; the lower teeth have a similar shape , though the serrations are smaller and the tips curve gently upward . The teeth of juveniles are smooth @-@ edged . 
 The broad , triangular pectoral fins originate below the third or fourth gill slits , and are no longer than the front margin of the first dorsal fin . The anal fin is about twice as long as the second dorsal fin and preceded by long ridges . The first dorsal fin originates over the pectoral fin free rear tips , and the much smaller second dorsal fin originates over the last third of the anal fin base . The dorsal fins do not have a ridge between them . The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well @-@ developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip . This shark is plain gray , brown @-@ gray , or purple @-@ gray above , and white below . The leading edge of the first dorsal fin and the trailing edge of the caudal fin may be dark , and the trailing edges of the pectoral fins may be light .

 One of the most ( if not the most ) abundant near @-@ shore sharks within its range , the milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes . Occasionally squid , octopus , cuttlefish , crabs , shrimp , and gastropods are also taken . In Shark Bay , the most important prey are silversides , herring , smelt @-@ whitings , and wrasses ; this is also the only local shark species that preys on the Waigeo <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , found in seagrass beds avoided by other sharks . In the Gulf of Carpentaria , it feeds mainly on halfbeaks , herring , and mullets , and is also a major predator of penaeid prawns . Smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans , switching to fish as they grow older . 
 Many predators feed on the milk shark , including larger sharks such as the blacktip shark ( Carcharhinus limbatus ) and Australian blacktip shark ( Carcharhinus tilstoni ) , and possibly also marine mammals . Off KwaZulu @-@ Natal , the decimation of large sharks by the use of gillnets to protect beaches has led to a recent increase in milk shark numbers . A known parasite of this species is the copepod Pseudopandarus australis . There is some evidence that male and female milk sharks segregate from each other .
