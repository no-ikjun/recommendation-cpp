 Selwood is the third of four children born to Bryce and Maree Selwood . He has three brothers , all having been listed with AFL clubs ; two older brothers , twins Adam ( played for West Coast ) and Troy ( played for the Brisbane Lions and a previous Geelong VFL captain ) and a younger brother , Scott ( previously played for West Coast , now plays for Geelong with Joel ) . Maree was awarded the 2005 AFL Players Association Mother of the Year Award for her contribution to football through each of her sons . Selwood is also a descendant of the three <unk> brothers , <unk> to Maree , each of whom played VFL football in the 1930s . 
 Since winning the National Australia Bank @-@ sponsored AFL Rising Star Award , Selwood has been involved in several promotions for the bank , in an ambassadorial role and in several television advertisement appearances . He is also an ambassador for the AFL 's junior development program , <unk> , annually acting as a mentor for the junior player deemed ' <unk> of the Year ' . Along with his parents and brothers , Selwood works on behalf of the Seeing Eye Dogs Association ( <unk> ) organisation . Selwood and his family sponsor pups who are being trained as a seeing eye dogs — one named " Selwood " in his family 's honour . <unk> has said that the family 's widespread dispersal around Australia , with Adam and Scott in Western Australia , Joel and Troy remaining in Victoria , has helped to publicise the organisation 's nationwide activity . During the 2010 season , Selwood was officially appointed as the club 's community ambassador for various charitable community activities . Selwood subsequently became the public face of both the Cotton On Foundation and its sponsorship for the rebuilding of the children 's ward at Geelong Hospital . 
 Early success on the field has led to several endorsement and promotional deals with companies including Asics and Smith 's . Selwood also features in a special edition Monopoly AFL premiership gameboard , occupying Bow Street . 
 Selwood has been a lifelong supporter of the Geelong Football Club , and cites the club 's own Hall of Fame member Gary Ablett as a childhood idol , along with Sydney players Paul Kelly and Brett Kirk . He currently resides in Geelong West , where he lives with a pair of childhood friends . Prior to the 2009 AFL premiership season , Selwood was elected to the AFL Players Association committee as the Geelong alternate delegate representative .

 = TBR1 = 
 T @-@ box , brain , 1 is a transcription factor protein important in vertebrate embryo development . It is encoded by the TBR1 gene . This gene is also known by several other names : T @-@ Brain 1 , <unk> @-@ 1 , TES @-@ 56 , and <unk> . TBR1 is a member of the TBR1 subfamily of T @-@ box family transcription factors , which share a common DNA @-@ binding domain . Other members of the TBR1 subfamily include EOMES and <unk> . TBR1 is involved in the differentiation and migration of neurons and is required for normal brain development . TBR1 interacts with various genes and proteins in order to regulate cortical development , specifically within layer VI of the developing six @-@ layered human cortex . Studies show that TBR1 may play a role in major neurological diseases such as Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) and Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 TBR1 was identified in 1995 by the Nina Ireland Laboratory of Developmental Neurobiology Center at the University of California , San Francisco . The gene , initially named TES @-@ 56 , was found to be largely expressed in the <unk> vesicles of the developing forebrain of mice . The protein product of TES @-@ 56 was discovered to be homologous to the <unk> protein , a T @-@ box transcription factor , which plays a role in establishing symmetry during embryonic development . Thus , due to its relation to T @-@ box genes ( such as Tbx @-@ 1 , Tbx @-@ 2 , Tbx @-@ 3 ) , TES @-@ 56 was renamed TBR1 . 
 = = Human TBR1 gene and encoded protein = = 
 The human TBR1 gene is located on the q arm of the positive strand of chromosome 2 . It is 8 @,@ 954 base pairs in length . TBR1 is one of the three genes that make up the TBR1 subfamily of T @-@ box genes . The two other genes that form the TBR1 subfamily are EOMES ( also known as <unk> ) and <unk> ( also known as T @-@ BET ) . TBR1 is also known as T @-@ box Brain Protein , T @-@ Brain 1 , and TES @-@ 56 . The encoded protein consists of 682 amino acid residues and has a predicted molecular weight of 74 @,@ 053 Da . It is composed of 6 exons .

 Tbr1 is a protein , called a transcription factor , that binds to DNA and regulates the transcription of genes into mRNA . It is expressed in postmitotic projection neurons and is critical for normal brain development . Tbr1 has been shown to be expressed in the developing olfactory bulb . Tbr1 has also been observed in the developing cerebral cortex . 
 Tbr1 has several functions . These include involvement in the developmental process , brain development , neuronal differentiation , axon guidance , and regulation of neurons in the developing neocortex . 
 = = = Neuronal differentiation = = = 
 Tbr1 , along with Pax6 and Tbr2 , has a role in glutamatergic projection neuron differentiation . <unk> neurons make and release in an activity @-@ dependent manner the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate as opposed to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA . The transition from radial glial cells to postmitotic projection neurons occurs in three steps , each associated with one of the aforementioned transcription factors . The first starts out with the expression of Pax6 in radial glial cells found primarily at the ventricular surface . In the next step , Pax6 is downregulated and Tbr2 is expressed as the cell differentiates into an intermediate progenitor cell . Likewise , in the final step , Tbr2 is extremely downregulated to undetectable levels as Tbr1 signals the transition into a postmitotic projection neuron . 
 = = = Modulation of <unk> = = = 
 In cultured hippocampal neurons , Tbr1 and calcium / calmodulin @-@ dependent serine kinase ( CASK ) interact with CASK @-@ interacting nucleosome assembly protein ( CINAP ) to modulate the expression of N @-@ methyl @-@ D @-@ aspartic acid receptor subunit 2b ( NR2b ) by acting on its promoter region . Tbr1 is a transcriptional regulator of <unk> , an essential subunit of NMDA receptors . 
 = = = <unk> guidance = = = 
 Cells that stop dividing ( post @-@ mitotic ) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development are important in laying the groundwork on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination . Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex . It is largely expressed in post @-@ mitotic neurons of the preplate , which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move . As a transcription factor , Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN , which encodes the <unk> protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells . Thus , through regulation of <unk> expression , Tbr1 regulates the formation of the matrix through which neurons migrate . Without Tbr1 , neurons fail to migrate properly . 
 = = Tissue and cellular distribution = = 
 Being a transcription factor , a protein that binds to specific DNA sites and thereby regulates the activity of specific genes , Tbr1 is localized in the nucleus where the cell ’ s DNA is located . Tbr1 is expressed in <unk> neurons rather than GABAergic neurons . 
 Tbr1 is expressed mainly in early @-@ born postmitotic neurons of the developing cerebral cortex — in particular , the preplate and layer VI neurons . The preplate forms the architectural network of neurons that help developing neurons migrate . Successive migrations of neurons divide the preplate such that its inner cells form the cortical plate while its outer cells form the marginal zone . The cortical plate and the marginal zone eventually develop into six cortical layers , known as the neocortex , present in the mature cerebral cortex . These layers are numbered I @-@ VI with layer VI being the deepest and forming first , while the remaining layers grow outward from it ( from V to I ) . Layers II @-@ VI develop from the cortical plate and layer I forms from the marginal zone . The subplate , intermediate zone , subventricular zone , and ventricular zone are found progressively deeper to these developing cortical layers . High expression of Tbr1 is seen in the marginal zone , cortical plate , and subplate of the developing cortex whereas little expression is seen in the subventricular zone . No Tbr1 expression has been observed in the ventricular zone . 
 Other regions of Tbr1 expression are : the olfactory bulbs and olfactory nuclei , the lateral hypothalamus region , the <unk> nucleus , the <unk> thalami . 
 = = Non @-@ human orthologs = = 
 <unk> of the human TBR1 gene have been identified in chimpanzee , dog , cow , rat , mouse , and zebrafish . 
 = = = Mice = = = 
 In mice , TBR1 has been found to function in development of the brain , eye , immune system , mesoderm , and placenta . It is also involved in glutamatergic neuronal differentiation in the developing mouse brain . It was discovered that <unk> @-@ 1 is expressed by postmitotic cortical neurons in mice and in humans . One target gene of TBR1 in the mouse brain is RELN or Reelin . <unk> @-@ 1 mutant mice have been found to have reduced RELN expression , resulting in improper neuronal migration , particularly in Cajal @-@ Retzius cells of the marginal zone . 
 Other studies in mice have found that TBR1 is a repressor or Fezf2 . It has also been found to negatively regulate corticospinal tract formation . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Studies in the zebrafish Danio rerio show that TBR1 is highly conserved across species . TBR1 cDNA clones from zebrafish were acquired by screening a zebrafish embryo using a phosphorus labeled probe . The TBR1 found in zebrafish ( <unk> @-@ TBR1 ) has 83 @-@ 97 % amino acid identity to orthologs in humans ( hu @-@ TBR1 ) , <unk> ( x @-@ EOMES ) , and mice ( mu @-@ TBR1 ) . The zebrafish TBR1 is only expressed in the forebrain , not in other regions of the zebrafish embryo . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The evolution of TBR1 has been studied in <unk> , also known as lancelets . A T @-@ box @-@ containing cDNA was isolated in the lancelet <unk> <unk> and found to possess a T @-@ domain orthologous to that of the T @-@ Brain subfamily of T @-@ box genes , specifically TBR1 . However , lancelets lack a true brain and no TBR1 transcripts were found in the neural tissue of the lancelet . This suggests that the neuronal role of TBR1 evolved in vertebrates after the lancelet lineage had already diverged from that of vertebrates . 
 = = Gene regulation = = 
 TBR1 both positively and negatively regulates gene expression in postmitotic neurons . 
 = = = Genes regulated by TBR1 = = = 
 Fezf2 is a gene that is regulated by TBR1 . Fezf2 expression is observed in layer V of the cerebral cortex . The cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers . Fezf2 expression is restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract , which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control . Recent studies show that TBR1 , expressed in layer VI , binds directly to the Fezf2 gene , preventing Fezf2 expression in layer VI . In this manner , TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2 . Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression in layer VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract . Abnormal activation of TBR1 in layer V eliminates corticospinal tract formation . 
 Bhlhb5 is a gene marker in the mouse brain , which is involved in differentiation of caudal identity in layer V neurons of the developing cortex , and is regulated by TBR1 . It is expressed at high levels in caudal regions , but is not generally observed in the frontal cortex . Tbr1 is expressed at very high levels in the frontal cortex and very lower levels in the caudal regions . Using <unk> null mutants , it was found that Bhlhb5 is up @-@ regulated in the absence of TBR1 . This up @-@ regulation of Bhlhb5 led to the conclusion that <unk> suppresses caudal identity while promoting frontal identity . 
 The gene Auts2 is also regulated by TBR1 . The autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene ( Auts2 ) is a marker of frontal identity in the developing cortex and has been linked to mental retardation and autism . Auts2 is a target of the transcription factor , TBR1 , in the neocortex . TBR1 is involved in both the binding and activation of the Auts2 gene . 
 = = = Co @-@ regulatory proteins = = = 
 Tbr1 forms a complex with CASK and regulates gene expression in cortical development . Tbr1 binds to the <unk> kinase ( GK ) domain of CASK . It was determined that the C @-@ terminal domain of Tbr1 in crucial and solely capable of this process . Through luciferase reporter assays of neurons in the hippocampus , it was found that increased Tbr1 / CASK complex expression results in enhanced promoter activity in genes downstream of TBR1 such as <unk> subunit 2b ( NMDAR2b ) , glycine transporter , interleukin @-@ 7 receptor ( IL @-@ 7R ) and OX @-@ 2 genes . NMDAR2b experienced the greatest change in activity . 
 Tbr1 and CASK also play an important role in activation of the RELN gene . One study suggests that CASK acts as a coactivator of TBR1 , interacting with CINAP ( CASK @-@ interacting nucleosome assembly protein ) to form a complex with Tbr1 . The Tbr1 / CASK / CINAP complex regulates expression of NMDAR2b and RELN , which both play important roles in long @-@ term potentiation . 
 Sox5 is another co @-@ regulatory protein of Tbr1 . Sox5 is a marker of layer VI neurons in the neocortex . It aids in the suppression of layer V neuron identity within layer VI cortical neurons through suppression of Fezf2 . TBR1 is involved in the downstream regulation of Sox5 . Sox5 expression was reduced in Tbr1 null mutants . It has been found that Sox5 interacts with Tbr1 to regulate Fezf2 transcription in layer VI cortical neurons . 
 = = = Transcription factors that regulate the expression of Tbr1 = = = 
 Studies suggest that the Af9 protein acts as a repressor of Tbr1 in the upper layers of the six @-@ layer developing cerebral cortex , thereby confining Tbr1 to the lower cortical layers ( preplate , subplate , layer VI ) . This process is regulated through interaction of Af9 with the methyltransferase <unk> , which <unk> histone H3 lysine 79 ( H3K79 ) . Af9 association with <unk> enhances methylation of H3K79 at the TBR1 transcription start site , thereby interfering with RNA polymerase II ( <unk> ) activity and reducing TBR1 expression . Mutants of Af9 experience increased <unk> of H3K79 and increased TBR1 expression . 
 = = Clinical significance = = 
 TBR1 has been implicated in alterations in the brain that may lead to Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) and Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . TBR1 expressing mice showed that cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain ( <unk> ) , the degeneration of which are involved in the development of AD and PD , migrate from the ventral pallium to the <unk> . This was confirmed using TBR1 null mice . In the future , the researchers plan to explore the role of amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) in neuronal migration and linkage to these diseases . 
 Reduced function of NMDA receptors play a role in schizophrenia . This diminished function of NMDA receptor may be correlated with the reduced expression of the NMDA receptor 2B subunit ( NR2b ) , which has also been linked to schizophrenia . TBR1 , in complex with the protein , CINAP , is responsible for regulating transcription of the NR2b gene . It was hypothesized in one 2010 study that reduced TBR1 and CINAP expression may be responsible for the reduced expression of the NR2b subunit observed in brains of postmortem schizophrenics . However , TBR1 and CINAP expression were not significantly reduced in the postmortem brains , suggesting that synthesis and processing of NR2b via TBR1 is not responsible for reduced NR2b expression in schizophrenics . 
 TBR1 expression has been shown to be downregulated by embryonic exposure to cocaine . Prenatal cocaine exposure in a mouse model caused a decrease in both GABA neuron migration from the basal to the dorsal forebrain and radial neuron migration in the dorsal forebrain . This exposure also decreased TBR1 and <unk> expression . However , further research showed that cocaine exposure only delayed TBR1 expression and did not cause permanent downregulation . Therefore , in models of prenatal cocaine exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed . 
 TBR1 is also used in immunohistochemical techniques in neurological research . It has been used to identify layer VI developing cortical neurons as well as the <unk> eminence , pallium , and dorsal forebrain . The presence of TBR1 in stem cells responding to telencephalon injury implicates the normal function of these cells in this region of the brain . 
 Mutations of this gene have also been associated with <unk> . 
 = Principes = 
 Principes ( Singular : Princeps ) were spearmen , and later swordsmen , in the armies of the early Roman Republic . They were men in the prime of their lives who were fairly wealthy , and could afford decent equipment . They were the heavier infantry of the legion who carried large shields and wore good quality armour . 
 Their usual position was the second battle line . They fought in quincunx formation , supported by light troops . They were eventually done away with after the Marian reforms of 107 BC . 
 = = History and deployment = = 
 Principes appear to have been born remnants of the old third class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus . The second class stood in some of the first few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to principes . They would support the heavier first class in the front ranks . It is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat at the hands of the Gallic warlord Brennus , who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones , taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough , hilly ground of central Italy . 
 = = = Camillan system = = = 
 In the early Camillan system of organisation of the 3rd and 4th centuries BC , men were sorted into classes based on wealth , the principes being the wealthiest after the triarii . Principes were armed with short spears , or hastae , up to 1 @.@ 8 metres ( 6 ft ) long . They fought in quincunx formation , usually carrying scuta , large rectangular shields , and bronze helmets , often with a number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature . They wore heavier armour types , the most common form being chainmail , which offered a good degree of protection without hindering movement . 
 In this type of legion , the 900 principes formed 15 maniples , military units of 60 men each . The principes stood in the second battle line , behind hastati of the first line and in front of the triarii in the third . In a pitched battle , the leves , javelin armed light infantry would form up at the front of the legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati , light spearmen . 
 If the hastati failed to break the enemy during their engagement , they would fall back and let the heavier principes take over . If the principes could not break them , they would retire behind the heavy triarii spearmen who would then engage the enemy in turn . The equites , cavalrymen , were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies . The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line were some of the least dependable troops , and were used in a support role , providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line . 
 = = = Polybian system = = = 
 By the time of the Punic wars of the 2nd century BC , this form of organisation was found to be inefficient . In a new Polybian system , infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth , the principes being older veterans with a greater degree of experience . Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system , except they now carried swords , or gladii , instead of spears . Each princeps also carried 2 pila , heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from the victim or thrown back 
 The principes had been increased in number to 1200 per legion , and formed 10 maniples of 120 men each . The rorarii and accensi had been done away with . Leves had been replaced with velites , who had a similar role , with forty of them being attached to each maniple in the legion . Pitched battles were conducted in a similar fashion ; the velites would gather at the front and fling javelins to cover the advance of the hastati , who had also been re @-@ armed with swords . If the hastati failed to break the enemy , they would fall back on the principes . If the principes could not break them , they would retire behind the triarii who would then engage the enemy . 
 This order of battle was almost always followed , the battle of the Great Plains and the battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions . At the Great Plains , Scipio , the Roman general , formed his men up in the usual manner , but once the hastati had begun to engage the enemy , he used his principes and triarii as a flanking force , routing the opposing Carthaginians . At Zama , Scipio arranged his men into columns , side by side , with large lanes in between . The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans . Once the surviving elephants had been routed , he formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks , ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry . 
 = = = Marian reforms = = = 
 With the formal military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC , intended to combat a shortage of manpower from wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north , the different classes of units were done away with entirely . The wealth and age requirements were scrapped . Soldiers would join as a career , rather than as service to the city , and would all be equipped as miles , or soldiers , with the same , state purchased equipment . Auxiliaries , local irregular troops , would fulfill other roles , serving as archers , skirmishers and cavalry . 
 = Manchester Mummy = 
 Hannah Beswick ( 1688 – February 1758 ) , of Birchin Bower , Hollinwood , Oldham , Lancashire , was a wealthy woman who had a pathological fear of premature burial . Following her death in 1758 her body was embalmed and kept above ground , to be periodically checked for signs of life . 
 The method of embalming was not recorded , but it probably involved replacing the blood with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion . The body was then put in an old clock case and stored in the house of Beswick 's family physician , Dr Charles White . Beswick 's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity , and visitors were allowed to view her at White 's house . 
 Beswick 's mummified body was eventually bequeathed to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society , where she was put on display and acquired the <unk> of the Manchester Mummy , or the Mummy of Birchin Bower . The museum 's collection was later transferred to Manchester University , when it was decided , with the permission of the Bishop of Manchester , that Beswick should finally be buried . The ceremony took place at Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868 , more than 110 years after her death ; the grave is unmarked . 
 = = Background = = 
 The mid @-@ 18th century saw an upsurge in the public 's fear of being mistakenly buried alive , and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death . Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial , ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse 's mouth to applying red hot <unk> to the feet , or even into the rectum . Writing in 1895 , the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2 @,@ 700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales , although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800 . 
 Hannah Beswick was born in 1688 and inherited considerable wealth from her father , John Beswick of Failsworth . Some years before her own death , one of Hannah 's brothers , John , had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed . A mourner noticed that John 's eyelids appeared to be flickering , and on examination the family physician , Dr Charles White , confirmed that he was still alive . John regained consciousness a few days later , and lived for many more years . 
 Jessie Dobson , Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England , has said that there appear to be many " inaccuracies and contradictions " in accounts of the events following Beswick 's death in 1758 . Many suggest that she left £ 25 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to about £ 3 million as of 2016 ) to White , a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the founders of the Manchester Royal Infirmary , on the condition that her body was kept above ground , and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life . Beswick 's will however , dated 25 July 1757 ( less than a year before her death ) , states only that White was to receive £ 100 ( £ 12 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) , and that £ 400 ( £ 48 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) was to be allocated for funeral expenses . Some accounts have suggested that White was an executor of Beswick 's will and that he received the £ 400 himself , from which he was permitted to keep any surplus after the funeral expenses had been paid . Having Beswick embalmed therefore allowed him to keep the whole amount . Alternatively it has been suggested that White was considerably in debt to Beswick , a debt that would have to be repaid after the funeral , which was avoided by her embalming , but Beswick 's will names Mary Graeme and Esther Robinson as her executors , not White . In 1866 , more than 100 years after her death , the details of Beswick 's will were still being disputed . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 There is no mention in Beswick 's 1757 will of her desire to be embalmed . It has been suggested that White had been asked to keep Beswick above ground only until it became obvious that she was actually dead , but that he was unable to resist the temptation to add a mummy to his collection of " wet and dry " exhibits , and so made the decision to embalm her . White had developed a particular interest in anatomy while studying medicine in London and was building up a collection of " curiosities " , which by the time of his death included the skeleton of Thomas Higgins , a highwayman and sheep @-@ stealer hanged for burglary , as well as Hannah Beswick 's mummy . 
 The method of embalming used by White is unrecorded , but in 1748 he had studied under the anatomist William Hunter , who had developed an early system of arterial embalming , therefore it is likely that White used the same method . The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion , after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water , to clean them and to reduce their bulk . As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse , and the whole body washed with alcohol . The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion . The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor , nitre and resin , before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor . After a final washing , the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris , to absorb any moisture , and then probably coated with tar , to preserve it .

 Beswick 's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall , the home of another Beswick family member , but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White 's home in Sale , Cheshire , where it was stored in an old clock case . Beswick 's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity ; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White 's house . Following White 's death in 1813 , Beswick 's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier , on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society , where she became known as the Manchester Mummy , or the Mummy of Birchin Bower . She was displayed in the museum 's entrance hall , next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy , and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished . She was described by a visitor in 1844 as " one of the most remarkable objects in the museum " . The " cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century " , according to writer Edith Sitwell . 
 There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick . One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth , a local historian : 
 The body was well preserved but the face was shrivelled and black . The legs and trunks were tightly bound in a strong cloth such as is used for bed ticks [ a stiff kind of mattress cover material ] and the body , which was that of a little old woman , was in a glass coffin @-@ shaped case . 
 Shortly after the museum 's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was " irrevocably and unmistakably dead " , the time had come for her to be buried . But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place ; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State , who issued an order for her burial . With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester , Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868 , more than 110 years after her death . 
 = = Treasure and alleged apparitions = = 
 Bonnie Prince Charlie entered Manchester at the head of his invading army in 1745 , causing Beswick some apprehension over the safety of her money , which she therefore decided to bury . Shortly before her death she promised to show her relatives where the treasure was hidden , but she did not survive long enough to do so . Her home , Birchin Bower , was converted into workers ' tenements following her death . Several of those living there claimed to have seen a figure dressed in a black silk gown and a white cap , and described it as Hannah Beswick . After gliding across the house 's parlour , the apparition would vanish at one particular flagstone . It is claimed that while digging to fit a new loom , a weaver living there discovered Beswick 's hoard of gold , hidden underneath that same flagstone . Oliphant 's , a Manchester gold dealer , paid the weaver £ 3 10s for each gold piece , the equivalent of almost £ 450 in 2016 . 
 Birchin Bower was eventually demolished to make way for a Ferranti factory , but sightings of the apparition were still reported .

 = = Plot = = 
 Sixteen @-@ year @-@ old Minnesota high @-@ schooler Juno MacGuff ( Ellen Page ) discovers she is pregnant by her friend and longtime admirer , Paulie Bleeker ( Michael Cera ) . She initially considers an abortion . Going to a local clinic run by a women 's group , she encounters a schoolmate outside who is holding a rather pathetic one @-@ person pro @-@ life vigil . Once inside , however , a variety of factors lead Juno to leave . She decides against abortion , and she decides to give the baby up for adoption . With the help of her friend Leah ( Olivia Thirlby ) , Juno searches the ads in the <unk> and finds a couple she feels will provide a suitable home . She tells her father , Mac ( J.K. Simmons ) , and stepmother , Bren ( Allison Janney ) , who offer their support . With Mac , Juno meets the couple , Mark and Vanessa Loring ( Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner ) , in their expensive home and agrees to a closed adoption . 
 Juno visits Mark a few times , with whom she shares tastes in punk rock and horror films . Mark , who has set aside his rock band youth ( now confined to memorabilia displayed in the one room of the house that Vanessa has designated for Mark 's personal belongings ) , works at home composing commercial jingles . Juno and Leah happen to see Vanessa in a shopping mall being completely at ease with a child , and Juno encourages Vanessa to talk to her baby in the womb , where it kicks for her . 
 As the pregnancy progresses , Juno struggles with the emotions she feels for the baby 's father , Paulie , who is clearly in love with Juno . Juno maintains an outwardly indifferent attitude toward Paulie , but when she learns he has asked another girl to the upcoming prom , she angrily confronts him . Paulie reminds Juno that it is at her request they remain distant and tells her that she broke his heart . 
 Not long before her baby is due , Juno is again visiting Mark when their interaction becomes emotional . Mark then tells her he will be leaving Vanessa . Juno is horrified by this revelation , with Mark asking Juno " How do you think of me ? " Vanessa arrives home , and Mark tells her he does not feel ready to be a father and there are still things he wants to do first . Juno watches the Loring marriage fall apart , then drives away and breaks down in tears by the side of the road . Returning to the Lorings ' home , she leaves a note and disappears as they answer the door . 
 After a heartfelt discussion with her father , Juno accepts that she loves Paulie . Juno then tells Paulie she loves him , and Paulie 's actions make it clear her feelings are very much reciprocated . Not long after , Juno goes into labor and is rushed to the hospital , where she gives birth to a baby boy . She had deliberately not told Paulie because of his track meet . Seeing her missing from the stands , Paulie rushes to the hospital , finds Juno has given birth to their son , and comforts Juno as she cries . Vanessa comes to the hospital where she joyfully claims the newborn boy as a single adoptive mother . On the wall in the baby 's new nursery , Vanessa has framed Juno 's note , which reads : " Vanessa : If you 're still in , I 'm still in . — Juno . " The film ends in the summertime with Juno and Paulie playing guitar and singing together , followed by a kiss .

 = = Themes = = 
 Along with Knocked Up and Waitress , two other 2007 films about women facing unplanned pregnancies , Juno was interpreted by some critics as having a pro @-@ life theme . Ann Hulbert of Slate magazine believed that Juno " [ undercut ] both pro @-@ life and pro @-@ choice purism . " Jeff Dawson of The Sunday Times believed that the film was inevitably placed in the " unwanted pregnancy subgenre " with Knocked Up and Waitress due to its subject matter but thought that its interpretation as a pro @-@ life film only " muddied the waters " . Hadley Freeman of The Guardian criticized Juno for " complet [ ing ] a hat @-@ trick of American comedies in the past 12 months that present abortion as unreasonable , or even unthinkable — a telling social sign " , though she noted , " I don 't believe any of these films is consciously designed to be anti @-@ abortion propaganda . " A. O. Scott , writing for The New York Times , agreed that Juno has " an underlying theme , a message that is not anti @-@ abortion but rather pro @-@ adulthood " . Ellen Page commented , " What I get most frustrated at is when people call it a pro @-@ life movie , which is just absurd ... The most important thing is the choice is there , and the film completely demonstrates that . " Cody and Page have openly stated that they are pro @-@ choice ; Reitman thought that it was " fantastic " that pro @-@ life and pro @-@ choice groups were embracing the film . He said that " Juno seems to be a mirror , and people [ on both sides ] see themselves in it " . 
 Other critics labeled Juno as feminist because of its portrayal of Juno as a confident and intelligent teenage girl . <unk> Phyllis Schlafly wrote that Juno 's theme " isn 't love , romance , or respect for life , but the triumph of feminist ideology , i.e. , the irrelevancy of men , especially fathers " . Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe concluded " Juno serves cool , intelligent girls something they rarely see in a movie : themselves " . Cody said about writing the film , " Women are clever , women are funny , women are sharp , and I wanted to show that these girls were human and not the stereotypical teenage girls that we often see in the media " and " There was a lack of authentic teen girl characters ... I saw writing this screenplay as an opportunity to create an iconic female . " Page praised the film for its positive depiction of teenage girls , describing Juno 's character as " really refreshing and allow [ ing ] for new possibilities in what young women can be " and " honest but original , completely devoid of stereotype " , while also highlighting that " Girls haven 't had that sort of character before . We don 't have our Catcher in the Rye " . She criticized the media perception of her character as a " strong woman " , arguing that if Juno were a male character , the " strength " of the character would not be considered remarkable . Reitman was interested in the personal / political conflict for Vanessa 's character : " Feminism has paved the way for Vanessa ’ s career , but ultimately Vanessa wants to be a full time mother . "

 = = = Development = = = 
 Diablo Cody was first approached to write a screenplay by film producer Mason Novick , who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir , Candy Girl : A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper , after discovering her blog about stripping . He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen , but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios ; that sample became Juno . After deciding on an adoption storyline , Cody collected the stories of <unk> , birth parents and adoptive parents , including that of her then husband , an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote the film . She also found inspiration in the story of a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend 's experience in the film , such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician . Much of Juno , however , was based on Cody 's own high school experiences : She dated a tic @-@ tac @-@ loving boy similar to Paulie , she was best friends with a cheerleader like Leah , and she used a hamburger phone identical to the one that appears in the film . After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section of a Target store in Crystal , Minnesota , Cody compared writing to breathing , seeing Juno as an extension of herself . 
 Novick sent Cody 's screenplay to his friend Jason Reitman ; by the time Reitman had read halfway through the script , he felt that if he did not direct the film , he would regret it for the rest of his life . Initially , Reitman found it difficult to acquire the script , because his first film , Thank You for Smoking , had not been released yet , so he did not have any feature film credits . Other directors , including Jon Poll , were considered , but Reitman was chosen and he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct Juno . Cody says she had a cynical attitude when writing Juno ( " I didn 't ever think this film would be produced " ) and , indeed , the film was delayed by financial problems . After its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios , John Malkovich 's production company , Mr. Mudd , took on the project . It was later brought to production company Mandate Pictures by co @-@ producer Jim Miller . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Having admired her performance in Hard Candy , Reitman cast Ellen Page in the lead role , saying that when he read the screenplay for the first time he pictured her as Juno . He visited her on the set of a film on which she was working to offer her the role . He also handed the script to J.K. Simmons , who had featured in his previous film , Thank You for Smoking , not telling him that he intended Simmons to play Mac . Simmons says that , after reading the script , he would have been happy to play even the high school teacher who has no speaking lines . Other cast members Reitman had " in mind right from the start " were Olivia Thirlby — who had originally unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Juno — and Michael Cera . He took them with Page and Simmons to a Panavision stage in California and shot 45 pages of the script on 35 mm film against a black backdrop . He presented this footage to Fox Searchlight as the initial cast . Reitman highlighted the importance of doing a screen test instead of individual auditions , saying : " This is a movie that ’ s all about relationships and the idea of auditioning people outside of each other , one @-@ on @-@ one with the casting director , didn ’ t make sense . " 
 Jennifer Garner , who accepted a lower salary than usual to prevent the film from exceeding its budget , was confirmed by Reitman to have signed onto the project in January 2007 . After working with Jason Bateman on The Kingdom , Garner recommended him to Reitman when they first met ; Bateman was cast as Mark , the last cast member to be signed . Lucas McFadden , better known as Cut Chemist , a DJ and record producer , makes a cameo appearance as Juno and Paulie 's chemistry teacher . McFadden was doing scoring work for Reitman when he received the Juno screenplay and asked McFadden to appear in the film ; Reitman thought that it was " perfect irony " for the chemistry teacher to be played by Cut Chemist . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Shooting on a budget of US $ 6 @.@ 5 million , Juno was filmed in and around Vancouver , British Columbia , standing in for Minnesota , where production was originally intended to take place . Although films commonly use a Canada @-@ as @-@ America location shift for budgetary reasons , Reitman insists the choice of filming location was instead at his request . Filming locations included a house in nearby White Rock as Mark and Vanessa 's home , Eric <unk> Secondary School as Dancing Elk High School , and South Surrey 's Athletic Park track as Dancing Elk High School 's athletics track . 
 After minimal rehearsal , filming took place in February and March 2007 on a six @-@ week schedule , of which 30 days were designated to filming . The crew was planning to import snow for the film 's winter events , but it snowed on location , and they were able to re @-@ schedule filming to shoot the winter scenes during snowfall , which second assistant director <unk> <unk> says resulted in much wider snow shots than originally planned . Although the film was shot out of sequence , the final scene was scheduled for the final day and , after a long period of rain , the crew was intending to shut down production and resume months later to shoot the scene , set in summer . However , the rain stopped and they were able to shoot the scene in the sun . That final scene depicted Juno and Paulie singing The Moldy Peaches ' " Anyone Else but You " , and band member Kimya Dawson visited the set to speak to Ellen Page and Michael Cera while they were practicing the song . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The movie features several songs performed by Kimya Dawson in her solo , Antsy Pants and The Moldy Peaches guises . This was due to a suggestion by lead actress Ellen Page . Director Jason Reitman explains : 
 " At one point , I asked Ellen Page before we started shooting , ‘ [ W ] hat do you think Juno listens to ? ’ And she said [ ‘ The Moldy Peaches . ' ] She went on my computer , played the songs , and I fell in love with it . Diablo and I discussed putting a Moldy Peaches song in it where the characters would sing to each other . I got in touch with Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches [ , ] and she started sending me her work , which was beautiful , and that became a lot of the soundtrack . " 
 Reitman contacted Dawson , and , after reading the film 's screenplay , she agreed for her songs to be used in the film , sending him a packet of CDs containing about 120 songs . The songs were almost entirely self @-@ published by Dawson , who says she wrote nothing specifically for Juno and that all the songs had been performed and recorded before she was contacted to work on the film . Reitman asked her to additionally re @-@ record instrumentals , which included humming over the lyrics of some of her songs . He also contacted composer Mateo Messina , with whom he had previously worked on Thank You for Smoking , to compose the film 's incidental score . He gave Messina a collection of Dawson 's songs and asked him to create " the sound of the film " through an instrumental score that replicated the recording quality , tone , feel and innocence of her music . Messina decided to implement an " acoustic guitar feel that was <unk> and was really loose , like Juno . " Experimenting with different guitars , he ended up using " Stella , " a second @-@ hand guitar belonging to guitarist Billy Katz that he described as " kind of tinny , not perfectly in tune , but [ it ] has all kinds of character . " Katz was hired to perform acoustic and classical guitar for the movie 's score , using " Stella " extensively throughout . 
 Page also suggested Cat Power 's cover of the song " Sea of Love " , which Reitman was hesitant to include as it had already been featured in the 1989 film Sea of Love ; however , he decided that its inclusion would mark a " new take " on the film 's cinematic references . Initially , Reitman had conceived of Juno being a fan of glam rock , but rejected it as too inauthentic , and he said he wanted to construct Juno to be " into music very real and authentic " , making her a fan of punk rock , including The Runaways , Patti Smith and Iggy Pop and the Stooges . He felt that the Sonic Youth cover of " Superstar " defined Juno and Mark 's relationship — Juno preferring the classic 1971 version by The Carpenters while Mark preferred Sonic Youth 's 1994 cover . " A Well Respected Man " by The Kinks was a song Reitman had associated with a character from another of his screenplays and says it was " heart @-@ breaking " when he decided to include the song as an introduction for Paulie instead , despite feeling it suited the scene perfectly . He found children 's songwriter Barry Louis Polisar 's " All I Want Is You " after " surfing iTunes for hours on end " using different words and names as search terms and thought that the handmade quality was perfect for the opening titles , which were afterwards made to correspond to the song . The " Brunch <unk> " jingle , Mark writes in the film , was composed by advertisement writer Chris Corley with whom Reitman had previously worked on a set of commercials for Wal @-@ Mart . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 The film was set out in a sequence of the year 's seasons , which , director Jason Reitman explains , " really resonated with me when I read it , because they mirror the three trimesters of Juno 's pregnancy . " Because filming took place over only 30 days , fake flora was used to give the impression of different seasons while other flora was edited in post @-@ production . Brown leaves were composited onto a fake tree outside Juno 's house and cherry blossom trees outside Leah 's house were touched up in a lighter shade of pink to depict autumn ; a fan was used to blow leaves around in some scenes as if the leaves were falling from trees . Fake flowers were used in front of Paulie 's house at the end of the film to give the impression of summer . Reitman used different colors to inform character , such as the burgundy and gold Dancing Elk High School track uniforms and an early scene with Juno in a red hooded jacket " walking through a world of somber greens and browns . " 
 Writer Cody was impressed with the production design team 's creation of the set from only a few sentences in her script , calling Juno 's bedroom " a very emotional set for [ me ] because it reminded me so much of my own little habitat when I was a teenager . " The walls of Juno 's room are covered with posters of bands , while Leah 's room includes a mural of older men whom she finds attractive , and Paulie 's room is designed to be overly childlike to indicate his innocence . Production designer Steve <unk> designed Mark and Vanessa 's house with the assumption that " Vanessa has probably read every home magazine and tried to copy what 's in them as best she could . " Costume designer Monique Prudhomme was nominated for a Costume Designers Guild Award in the " Excellence in Contemporary Costume Design for Film " category . She dressed Vanessa in clothes that were " simple and very tasteful " but with an " anal @-@ retentive quality , " while dressing Mark in conservative clothing that complements Vanessa 's taste . It was Page 's suggestion that Juno wear flannel shirts and sweater @-@ vests . Page also had to wear two sizes of prosthetic belly fitted like a corset in the back , as well as a third " real " belly that is seen when Juno has an ultrasound and a variety of sizes of fake breasts . The footage displayed on Juno 's ultrasound monitor is of supervising sound designer Scott Sanders 's son Matthew and was embedded into the scene in post @-@ production . 
 = = = Opening title sequence = = = 
 Juno 's opening title sequence , depicting a rotoscoped Juno walking through her town while drinking a bottle of <unk> orange drink , was put together over 7 – 8 months by a small design studio , Shadowplay Studio , based in Los Angeles . Reitman had met the studio 's co @-@ founder Gareth Smith in Japan on the short film festival circuit where they each had shorts screening . Shadowplay created the opening title sequence for Reitman 's previous film , Thank You for Smoking , and he contacted them again when he found out he was going to direct Juno . With vintage 1970s punk @-@ rock posters as inspiration , Smith and artist Jenny Lee decided to create a sequence that " had texture and a little bit of edge , but also imparted the warmth and heart of the screenplay " . In the last days of filming in Vancouver , Ellen Page was photographed with a high speed camera from a number of angles walking on a treadmill and drinking <unk> . 900 still images of a walking and drinking Page were printed out and repeatedly run through a Xerox machine to degrade their quality until the pictures appeared hand @-@ drawn . The pictures were cut @-@ out and scanned back onto the computer then layered onto the background drawn by Lee with compositing software to create a stop motion animation sequence that corresponded to " All I Want Is You " by Barry Louis Polisar , the song Reitman had chosen . Shadowplay also designed the <unk> for each of the seasons for the film , hand @-@ made a custom typeface for the opening title sequence and the closing credits , and collaborated on the design of the soundtrack and the DVD .

" It went on to feature at the Austin Film Festival , Rome Film Festival , London Film Festival , Bahamas International Film Festival , St. Louis International Film Festival , Stockholm International Film Festival , International Thessaloniki Film Festival , Gijón International Film Festival , Palm Springs International Film Festival and the International Film Festival Rotterdam , earning awards and nominations at several . 
 Although Juno was originally intended to open in theaters on December 15 , 2007 , it was moved forward to take advantage of the positive reviews and buzz preceding its release , and opened in limited release on December 5 , playing in only seven theaters in Los Angeles and New York City .

Though the phones were originally distributed in small numbers to viewers at promotional events , companies not affiliated with Fox Searchlight began to produce and sell the phones on eBay and other online stores .

 The film benefited from an extremely positive critical reception ; as of March 15 , 2008 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , 94 % of critics gave the film positive reviews , based on 205 reviews , making it the best reviewed comedy film on the website in 2007 . On Metacritic , the film had an average score of 81 out of 100 , based on 38 reviews . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film four stars and called it " just about the best movie of the year . [ ... ] Has there been a better performance this year than Ellen Page 's creation of Juno ? I don 't think so . " Ebert went on to place Juno at number one on his annual best of list . The film also ranks at number 463 in Empire magazine 's 2008 list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time . Juno MacGuff also ranked number 56 on Empire 's list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time . Paste Magazine named it one of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade ( 2000 – 2009 ) , ranking it at number 15 . In June 2010 , Entertainment Weekly named Juno one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years . 
 However , not all critics share the positive view towards Juno . David Edelstein of New York magazine felt that the film was desperate to be " a movie that confers hipness on teens , that makes kids want to use the same slang and snap up the soundtrack " . Music reviewer Jim DeRogatis criticized the film 's stylized dialogue and what he saw as a casual take on abortion and Juno 's naïveté in becoming pregnant , claiming : " As an unapologetically old @-@ school feminist , the father of a soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ teenage daughter , a reporter who regularly talks to actual teens as part of his beat and a plain old moviegoer , I hated , hated , hated this movie .

 = = = = " The Juno Effect " = = = = 
 In 2008 , after 17 students under sixteen years of age at a Gloucester , Massachusetts high school became pregnant , Time magazine called it the " Juno Effect " . Time stated that some adults dismissed the statistic as an outlier while others accused films such as Juno and Knocked Up for glamorizing teenage pregnancy . <unk> Miller , an Adolescent Psychology Professor at University of Minnesota @-@ Duluth stated that " [ t ] he ' Juno effect ' is how media <unk> pregnancy and how it 's also ... pregnancy is also redemptive of any past problems " . 
 After Senator John McCain named Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate on the Republican presidential ticket , it was revealed in September 2008 that Gov. Palin 's daughter , Bristol , age 17 , was pregnant with the child of another teenager . News reports and editorials termed Bristol Palin 's pregnancy as the latest episode in the debate over teen pregnancy of which Juno was a part , while conservative commentators made comparisons between Bristol Palin 's pregnancy and the film . Noted New Republic literary editor Leon <unk> , " The Republicans wanted a new conversation , and they got one . Juno in Juneau ! " Fox News ' Roger Friedman wondered , " Juno at once violated and vindicated conservative values . The question is , will the public rally ‘ round Bristol Palin the way it did Juno ? Or will it reject her for getting in this situation in the first place ? " 
 Juno actor Jason Bateman defended the film . " Unfortunately , " he said , " we ’ ve had these instances where guys kill people because of what they hear in rock ‘ n roll lyrics or some garbage like that . Look , if you ’ re going to blame a movie or song for your actions , whether they be good or bad , I think you ’ re looking at the wrong things to influence your life . I think people should look to other areas of their life for lessons and guidance , mainly parents , or teachers , or friends , or whomever . That should probably be where you should point your eyes and ears . " 
 Amy <unk> of Salon.com wrote in 2010 that , according to figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , pregnancy rates for all teenagers dropped 2 percent between 2007 and 2008 , meaning that " the slight uptick in teen pregnancy rates between 2005 and 2006 were probably just an anomaly and not some heinous trend brought about by pop culture " , and that if there had been such a thing as a " Juno effect " , it would have caused pregnancies to go down , not up . She criticized proponents of the theory , stating that they believed that teenagers " somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman 's particular situation , and instead make some sort of primitive cause @-@ and @-@ effect connection " and that " by talking about pregnant girls , and most of all , by daring to portray some of them as ordinary , even likable , we 'd get way more babies having babies . " She concluded that " depicting teen parents may not glamorize them , so much as humanize them . You know , that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too ? So , now that we can firmly state that realistically depicting the lives of the tiny percentage of girls who do become pregnant won 't necessarily contaminate the rest of them , it 's time to stop worrying and ask what we can do to help .

 The film received four 2008 Academy Awards nominations : Best Original Screenplay , which Diablo Cody won , Best Picture , Best Director , and Best Actress for Ellen Page . 
 Reitman expressed disappointment that Juno was ruled ineligible for the Genie Award nominations : 
 It 's a Canadian director , Canadian stars , Canadian cast , Canadian crew , shot in Canada — how are we not eligible for a Genie when David Cronenberg 's film [ Eastern Promises ] about Russians living in London shot in England with a British crew and British cast is eligible ? I 'm sorry , but somebody is going to have to explain that to me . 
 Sara Morton , the head of the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television , issued a statement explaining that the film had never been submitted for Genie Award consideration by its studio . The Hollywood Reporter explained that Genie rules define Canadian films as financed at least in part by Canadian sources , and because American companies Mandate Pictures and Fox Searchlight were the sole funders , Juno was ineligible . Nonetheless , Genie spokesman Chris McDowall said that while the film was not evaluated for eligibility since it was not submitted , " Financing is one of the criteria , but it 's not everything . " Despite this , the film was eligible for the 2008 Canadian Comedy Awards , receiving two wins from three nominations .

 = Sheng Long = 
 Sheng Long is a character hoax related to the Street Fighter series , created by Electronic Gaming Monthly ( EGM ) as an April Fool 's gag in 1992 ( in an issue published mid @-@ February ) . The joke , based upon a mistranslation that suggested the existence of a character named Sheng Long in the Capcom fighting game Street Fighter II , described a method to fight the character in the game . After other publications reprinted the details as fact without verifying the authenticity , the Sheng Long hoax spread worldwide . As a result of discussion revolving around the possibility of the character 's appearance in Street Fighter III during the game 's development , EGM revisited the joke in 1997 , printing an updated version of the hoax for the title while establishing a backstory and appearance for the character in the process . 
 As a character and a hoax , Sheng Long has been described as one of the most famous and well @-@ known legends related to video gaming by publications such as GameDaily and GameSpot . The hoax influenced the creation of both Akuma and Gouken as characters in the Street Fighter series , with the former appearing in Super Street Fighter II Turbo as a secret boss . Fan appeal for the character affected later Capcom titles , with public requests for the inclusion of Sheng Long in an actual video game leading to the consideration of his inclusion in the Street Fighter : The Movie video game and years later resulting in the appearance of Gouken as both a secret boss and playable character in Street Fighter IV . 
 = = Origin = = 
 The name Sheng Long comes from a mistranslated portion of the name of a special move performed by the series ' main character , Ryu ; the characters shō ryū ( <unk> rising dragon ) from <unk> ( <unk> ) , Ryu 's flying uppercut , is <unk> <unk> in Chinese pinyin . This was carried into one of Ryu 's quotes to defeated opponents in the English localization of the 1991 arcade game Street Fighter II , changing the Japanese quote " If you cannot overcome the Rising Dragon Punch , you cannot win ! " ( <unk> 、 <unk> ！ , <unk> wo <unk> <unk> , <unk> ni <unk> wa nai ! ) to " You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance . " As a result , players were given the impression that Ryu was referring to a person instead of the attack . 
 The Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) port of Street Fighter II released shortly after the April Fool prank changed the translation to " You must defeat my Dragon Punch to stand a chance . " However , the English instruction manual for the SNES Street Fighter II referred to " Master Sheng Long " as Ryu and Ken 's teacher . Instruction manuals for later ports to the SNES and Sega Mega Drive consoles replaced all references to Sheng Long by referring to Ryu and Ken as " disciples of Shotokan Karate " . A character named Gouken was later introduced in <unk> Kanzaki 's 1993 Street Fighter II manga as Ryu and Ken 's sensei , and was adapted into the series ' backstory in Super Street Fighter II Turbo . 
 = = = Original EGM April Fools 1992 = = = 
 The mistranslation spawned rumors about the existence of a Sheng Long character in the game , and players sent letters to video game publications attempting to confirm the character 's existence . In the April 1992 issue of the video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly , a method was " revealed " to reach Sheng Long in the arcade game . The reporter gave an " Honorable Mention " to " W.A. <unk> " ( waste tokens ) of " <unk> , HA " ( fooled again , ha ) , and claimed that the character could be found if a player using Ryu did not let the character suffer any damage during the entire game , and upon reaching the final match against M. Bison could neither hit Bison nor let him inflict any damage until the time limit expired , thus ending the round in a draw . After repeating this for ten consecutive rounds Sheng Long would then appear out of nowhere and throw Bison off of the edge screen and out of the way . The game 's on @-@ screen timer would then stop at 99 seconds , resulting in a " fight to the death " between Ryu and Sheng Long . 
 Sheng Long was stated to feature the special moves of all the fighters , such as Chun @-@ Li 's " Spinning Bird Kick " and <unk> 's " Tiger Shot " , but inflict more damage . In addition , the character was supposedly faster than any other fighter in the game , negating the pause between projectile attacks . Other attacks mentioned included an air @-@ based throw attack and a " Dragon Punch " shown to consume his fist in flames to represent his greater power . 
 The joke became an international sensation when publications from Europe , Hong Kong and other countries reprinted the trick without verifying it or asking EGM 's permission . A Hong Kong comic based on Street Fighter II by <unk> Comics altered their story to include the character . Players tried unsuccessfully for weeks to unlock Sheng Long , until it was revealed in the December issue of EGM that it was a hoax , with the staff stating they were surprised at the worldwide coverage the joke had received . 
 = = = EGM April Fools 1997 = = = 
 During the development of Street Fighter III , fans discussed the prospect of the character 's inclusion in the new title . EGM perpetuated the hoax again in 1997 by claiming that Sheng Long was in the game , providing character artwork depicting his appearance and new screenshots . Unlike the first article , they did not finish their explanation of how to reach him , ending the article with " To reach him , you will need at least six perfects and ... " Additionally , the words " April Fools " were spelled out in the first letter of the first ten sentences of the article . 
 The character 's design was expanded on greatly in the article ; Sheng Long was now stated to be the American name for the character Gouken , much like Akuma is the American name for <unk> ( which would appear in Second Impact revision of the game ) . His profile listed in the article paralleled Gouken 's , but instead of Akuma killing him he was knocked into a raging river . The result gave him a scar over his eye , and a desire to get revenge on his brother . To this end , he revived several " killing techniques " of his fighting style , which included an air version of Akuma 's red fireball that knocked his opponent down , a double ground high @-@ low Hadouken , an unblockable <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ Ken super attack that would shock the opponent , an air rapid Hadouken super attack akin to a move used by Ibuki , and a third super attack intended to be a stronger version of the Shun Goku <unk> . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Sheng Long is cited as an influential factor for the Street Fighter series , earning mention in articles such as GameDaily 's " Top 20 Street Fighter Characters of All Time " list , in which the character placed nineteenth despite not being an actual character . IGN placed it second on their list of the " Top Ten Gaming April Fools ' Pranks " , noting it as having the biggest impact of all of Electronic Gaming Monthly 's April Fools jokes . UGO.com named it one of video gaming 's greatest urban legends , noting its impact upon the series ' success . Capcom 's community manager Seth Killian described the hoax as " a part of gaming history " , comparing him to the Konami Code . However , GamesRadar listed it as one of the video game legends that they never want to hear again , stating that while it was a good prank at first , Sheng Long has gone from " sly wink to the fans " to " Borat t @-@ shirt . " The rumor is often credited with inspiring the creation of Akuma , a character who debuted as a hidden final boss in Super Street Fighter II Turbo , due to their similarities , although Capcom has never confirmed nor denied this . As in the hoax , the process of fighting Akuma would require certain achievements met during the game , with Akuma interrupting the final match of the game between the player and M. Bison . The similarity was nodded at in the high @-@ definition remake of Super Street Fighter II Turbo , in which an Xbox 360 Achievement titled " Sheng Long is in Another Castle " could be earned for defeating Akuma in the game 's arcade mode . In the 2012 Disney movie Wreck @-@ it Ralph , a piece of background graffiti reads , " Sheng Long was here ! " 
 = = = Street Fighter : The Movie = = = 
 Sheng Long is mentioned three times in the 1995 arcade game Street Fighter : The Movie in the endings for Ryu , Ken , and Akuma . In each , he is stated as the master of Ryu and Ken and Akuma 's brother , but never stated as dead . Despite the repeated mention , Sheng Long does not appear in the game . On January 30 , 2007 the game 's designer , Alan Noon , appeared on <unk> 's forum and discussed aspects of the game cut during development , among them a playable Sheng Long character . 
 According to Noon , while shooting and digitizing the character images for the game , talk had circulated about adding extra characters that were not in the film . As the Sheng Long hoax and Akuma 's debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo were fairly recent at the time , the designers asked for Capcom 's permission to add both characters into the game . Capcom approved the addition of Akuma , but denied the inclusion of Sheng Long . However , during the digitization sessions for Akuma , Capcom unexpectedly approved the addition of Sheng Long ; Noon stated that Capcom had ambitions that the game would crush Mortal Kombat II , and felt the character 's inclusion was a necessity for that goal . Noon designed Sheng Long 's appearance for the title , giving him a " mandarin style " gi and one hand taking the form of a dragon 's claw , described as a result of his power being so great that he began to physically transform into a dragon . Capcom approved the design , and an artist from the development team posed as Sheng Long . However , the character was left unfinished because of time constraints .

 In an interview in the January 2008 Issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly , Street Fighter IV producer Yoshinori Ono stated " Let 's just say that [ jokes ] that your magazine have reported in the past might find their way into the game as fan service . " Executive editor Shane Bettenhausen took this to mean the appearance of Sheng Long in Street Fighter IV , though added that if the character did appear in the game , it would be Gouken . When asked in a later interview by 1UP.com regarding the possibility of Sheng Long 's appearance in the title , Ono replied " Are you coming to the Tokyo Game Show ? How about you ask me that question again then . " Capcom later revealed Gouken as a character in Street Fighter IV , with Ono stating in an interview with Play magazine that his inclusion in the title was in response to fans requesting Sheng Long 's presence in the game . 
 On the first of April 2008 , Capcom announced Sheng Long as a " secret , unlock @-@ able character " in their Japanese development blog for Street Fighter IV and later posted in their official US blog accompanied with a silhouette of the character . The post took the tone of a Capcom PR representative trying to announce a character without giving away too many details , hinting that " Sheng Long is Ryu 's ... " then holding back and saying to wait for an official character announcement . Similar to the original EGM joke , the post lists the method to unlock him as requiring the player to win every round as Ryu without taking any damage whatsoever and then perform his " Shoryuken " move during the final boss fight . Reception to the joke the third time was negative , and included criticism from 1UP.com. The following day , the Japanese website confirmed that it was indeed a joke , and explained the origin of Sheng Long while adding " Sheng @-@ Long is still now and always will be , truly a character of legend . " 
 In the release version of the game , Ryu 's victory speech is correctly translated as " You must defeat my Shoryuken to stand a chance . " This line would later be quoted directly in Ryu 's character reveal trailer in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U , furthering its legacy . 
 = Bajar dengan Djiwa = 
 Bajar dengan Djiwa ( [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; Perfected Spelling : <unk> dengan <unk> ; Indonesian for " Pay with [ One 's ] Soul " ) is a now @-@ lost 1941 film from the Dutch East Indies ( modern day Indonesia ) . Directed by R Hu and produced by Ang Hock Liem , it starred A Bakar , Djoewariah , O Parma , Oedjang , RS Fatimah , Soelastri , and Zonder . The story centers on two families torn apart by finances and clashes of personality . 
 The third film produced by Union Films , Bajar dengan Djiwa featured many actors who had previously appeared in the company 's works . It was released by February 1941 . Advertisements emphasised the realism of the story , and reviewers praised the film 's acting , romance , and humour . Screenings continued until at least 1943 , more than a year after Union was closed following the Japanese occupation . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Bajar dengan Djiwa follows the interactions of several groups of people . Husband and wife Basuki ( Zonder ) and <unk> ( <unk> Soelastri ) clash because of their different personalities : the former is a thinker concerned with the state of society , while the latter only thinks of herself . Meanwhile , Umar ( Oedjang ) and <unk> ( RS Fatimah ) clash over Umar 's wasteful nature ; eventually , he sinks so far into debt that he must sell his daughter , <unk> ( Djoewariah ) , to a loan shark named <unk> ( O. Parma ) , a move which breaks the heart of <unk> 's boyfriend <unk> ( A Bakar ) . Other scenes include comic interactions between two servants , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Production = = 
 Bajar dengan Djiwa was directed by R Hu for Union Films . It was Hu 's second film for the company ; he had already completed one film for the company , Harta Berdarah ( Bloody Treasure ; 1941 ) , in collaboration with Rd Ariffien . The film , Union 's third , was produced by its head , Ang Hock Liem . The story was written by journalist Saeroen , who had joined Union with Harta Berdarah after previously finding success with Tan 's Film . 
 This black @-@ and @-@ white film starred A Bakar , Djoewariah , O Parma , Oedjang , RS Fatimah , Soelastri , and Zonder . It also included <unk> Ali , <unk> , Oesman , <unk> , <unk> , and Moesa . Many of these actors , including Soelastri and Fatimah , had been with Union since its first production , Kedok Ketawa ( The Laughing Mask ) , in 1940 . Others , including Moesa and Zonder , had made their debuts in Harta Berdarah . Djoewariah , a stage actress and keroncong singer , was a new hire . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Bajar dengan Djiwa , produced in 1940 , was released by February 1941 . By July 1941 the film was being screened in Singapore , then part of British Malaya . A novelisation of the film , written by Saeroen , was published by the Yogyakarta @-@ based Kolff @-@ Buning . In the East Indies , children under age 17 were prohibited from viewing . Advertisements , some which referred to the film with the Dutch title Met den Dood <unk> , emphasised the film 's " realistic " depiction of a married life . 
 A review in the Java Bode found that Bajar dengan Djiwa was one of the Best Malay films yet made , with " almost no stiffness and woodenness " in the acting . Another review , in the Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch @-@ Indië , described the film as " striking proof " of Saeroen 's knowledge of indigenous society and praised the film 's romance and humour . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 After Bajar Dengan Djiwa , Union produced a further five films ; all but one were directed by Hu or Ariffien . Saeroen wrote two of them , leaving for Star Film following Wanita dan Satria ( 1941 ) . Much of the cast remained with Union for several productions . The company 's subsequent production , Asmara Moerni ( 1941 ) , for instance , had Djoewariah in the leading role , alongside a new hire ( the doctor Adnan Kapau Gani ) . Union Films was ultimately dissolved following the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in March 1942 . In 2011 Ade Irwansyah of Tabloid Bintang listed the poster for Bajar Dengan Djiwa as one of the best Indonesian film posters of all time . 
 Bajar Dengan Djiwa was screened as late as October 1943 , but is now likely lost . Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film , and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara 's warehouse in 1952 , old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed . As such , American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost . However , JB Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia ( Indonesian Film Catalogue ) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia 's archives , and the film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that some Japanese propaganda films can be found at the Netherlands Government Information Service .

 = American Horror Story : Murder House = 
 American Horror Story : Murder House ( originally titled as American Horror Story ) is the first season of the FX television series American Horror Story , aired between October 5 , 2011 , through December 21 , 2011 . The season was produced by 20th Century Fox Television , and the executive producers were Dante Di Loreto and series creators Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy . 
 It centers on the Harmon family : Dr. Ben Harmon , Vivien and their daughter Violet , who move from Boston to Los Angeles after Vivien has a miscarriage and Ben has an affair . They move into a restored mansion , unaware that the house is haunted by its former residents and their victims . 
 The first season of American Horror Story received mixed reviews from critics . The cast was generally praised , while the writing was criticized . The series drew consistently high ratings for the FX network , ending its first season as the biggest new cable series of the year . The season was nominated for various industry awards , including the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama , and received a total of seventeen Emmy Award nominations . In addition , Lange won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress , the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series , and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie . 
 The Murder House made an appearance in the series ' fifth cycle , Hotel , with Christine Estabrook also returning as Marcy , the nosy realtor . Matt Ross , who portrayed Dr. Charles Montgomery , appeared in the episode " Room 33 " of Hotel , and Sarah Paulson reprised her role as Billie Dean Howard in the season finale . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The first season follows the Harmon family : Ben ( Dylan McDermott ) , Vivien ( Connie Britton ) and Violet ( Taissa Farmiga ) , who move from Boston to Los Angeles to start a new life in a Victorian mansion , after Vivien has a miscarriage and Ben has an affair with Hayden ( Kate Mara ) , one of his students . On arrival , they learn from Marcy ( Christine Estabrook ) , the real estate agent , that the previous owners of their new mansion , a couple named Chad and Patrick ( Zachary Quinto and Teddy Sears ) , died in an apparent murder / suicide . Their neighbor Constance ( Jessica Lange ) and her daughter Addie ( Jamie Brewer ) become frequent , and sometimes unwelcome , guests . Addie seems to have a connection with the house 's mysterious past . Larry Harvey ( Denis O 'Hare ) , a former resident of the house who has suffered from horrible burns , also begins inserting himself into the Harmons ' lives , giving Ben a cryptic warning about the house . The house also " comes with " Moira O 'Hara ( Frances Conroy / Alexandra Breckenridge ) , a housekeeper who appears young and seductive to men , but old and matronly to women . 
 Ben begins seeing patients out of his home office . One in particular , a possibly psychotic teenage boy named Tate Langdon ( Evan Peters ) , takes interest in kindred spirit Violet , who suffers from depression . Ben is unaware that Tate is both a ghost and the son of Constance . As the family settles into the home , bizarre events begin to occur with increasing regularity . It is soon revealed that there have been upwards of 20 violent deaths in the home over the course of its history , so much so that it has come to be known as " The Murder House " . The family struggles with their own personal tribulations , oblivious to the reality that their home is haunted by ghosts . While exploring the attic , Vivien discovers a latex bondage suit . She later is raped by a man wearing it , who she believes is Ben , but is actually Tate . Vivien 's rape results in the rare occurrence of becoming pregnant with twins by different fathers . It is later revealed that Tate 's motive in having sex with Vivien was to conceive a baby for Nora ( Lily Rabe ) , a ghost in the house who lost her own child . Hayden comes from Boston and tries to blackmail Ben into abandoning Vivien , so they can start their relationship over , threatening to tell Vivien that she 's pregnant with Ben 's baby . She is killed by Larry and buried by Ben in the house grounds , thus coming back as a ghost . Several ghosts in the house , including Hayden and Nora , conspire to drive Vivien mad so that they can raise the babies as their own . 
 On Halloween , the one day in which the dead can walk among the living , Violet learns that Tate is an infamous school shooter , who killed a library full of his classmates ( as well as crippling a teacher and setting Larry Harvey on fire ) to punish his mother Constance for having Tate 's younger ( and deformed ) brother euthanized . Addie is run over by a car , and Constance fails to get her corpse to the Harmon 's property in time to imprison her spirit so that she can be reunited with her brother 's ghost . Vivien , meanwhile , learns from the " Murder House Tour " that the house was the home of a back alley abortionist and that the still @-@ living monster in the basement of the house is the creation of the doctor , whose son was killed by a patient 's vengeful boyfriend , dismembered and resurrected as the monstrous " Infantata " . 
 Faced with the monster Tate is , and her own romantic feelings for him , Violet kills herself , something she doesn 't realize was successful until weeks later when she discovers she cannot leave the house . After many poltergeists , Vivien is committed to an insane asylum , while Ben is convinced that the second twin was fathered by Luke ( Morris Chestnut ) , a neighborhood security officer . Meanwhile , Constance enlists the help of a medium , Billie Dean Howard ( Sarah Paulson ) , to help her talk to Addie . Constance discovers from Billie Dean , to her horror , that Tate 's child with Vivien will become the Antichrist . After Ben learns of Tate being the " Rubber Man " , he has Vivien freed from the asylum . 
 Vivien gives birth to the twins in the house , with Moira recruiting the more benevolent ghosts of the house to help her deliver the children . Vivien and one of the newborn babies die , leaving Ben with the surviving twin . Violet breaks up with Tate after Chad reveals that Tate raped Violet 's mother and murdered him and his boyfriend due to their inability to produce a child . Ben tries to get into contact with his now dead wife and daughter , who refuse to show themselves . As he grieves he contemplates suicide to be with them . Instead , Vivien shows herself and convinces Ben to leave the house immediately for the protection of the baby . As Ben is leaving the house , he is caught and murdered by Hayden , who hangs him to simulate a suicide . Hayden attempts to take the baby , but Constance , with the help of the ghost of a lover named Travis ( Michael Graziadei ) , whom Hayden murdered , takes the child instead . Constance hides the baby and tells the police that Ben killed himself out of grief for his wife 's death and that Violet ( whose body is never found ) ran off with the surviving child . 
 Now trapped in the house , the Harmons team up with Moira and the other benevolent spirits to keep other families from moving in by scaring them away . Meanwhile , Tate has consigned himself to living with Hayden , both of whom have been blocked out by the Harmons using a trick that Tate taught Violet . As the Harmons are decorating a Christmas tree , Tate promises to wait for Violet forever , as he and Hayden watch on through a door frame . Three years later , Constance ( who left town ) returns to Los Angeles , but finds that her grandson , Michael ( the Antichrist ) , has murdered his nanny . She slowly walks towards the smiling child as he rocks back and forth . She then smiles and whispers , " Now what am I gonna do with you ? "

 Creators Murphy and Falchuk began working on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production . Murphy wanted to do the opposite of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series . He stated : " I went from Nip / Tuck to Glee , so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark . And I always had loved , as Brad had , the horror genre . So it just was a natural for me . " Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre , stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers . " You want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards , " he said . 
 The dark tone of the series is modeled after the ABC soap opera Dark Shadows , which Murphy 's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up . He also cited Rosemary 's Baby , Don 't Look Now , The Amityville Horror , and Stanley Kubrick 's version of The Shining as influences for the series as well . 
 From the beginning , Murphy and Falchuk planned that each season of the series would tell a different story . After the first season finale aired , Murphy spoke of his plans to change the cast and location for the second season , while retaining some actors from the first : " The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters , creatures , monsters , etc . [ The Harmons ' ] stories are done . " 
 In February 2011 , FX officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk , with both Murphy and Falchuk writing and Murphy directing . Dante Di Loreto was announced as executive producer . Production on the series began in April 2011 . In July 2011 , FX officially announced the project had been given a series order consisting of 13 episodes . On August 2011 , it was announced that Tim Minear , Jennifer Salt , James Wong and Jessica Sharzer had joined the series as writers . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Casting announcements began in March 2011 , with Connie Britton first to be cast , portraying female lead Vivien Harmon . Britton stated that she took a risk in taking the role of Vivien . When Murphy presented the role to her , he said : " This is something we 've never seen you do before . It will be turning what you 've just been doing on its ear . " She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately decided to take the part . In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , series co @-@ creator Ryan Murphy stated that he had told Connie Britton , early on , that her character Vivien would die in the first season . " We 've really had the whole season mapped out from the beginning , " he said . " In the meetings with the core actors , the three leads being Connie , Dylan [ McDermott ] and Jessica [ Lange ] , as we tried to snare them we were able to say this is where you start , this is the middle , and this is where you end up . So , yes , I was able to tell Connie really the whole run of the series . " 
 Denis O 'Hare joined the cast in late March 2011 as Larry Harvey . Jessica Lange joined the cast in April 2011 as Constance , marking her first regular role on television . Lange was attracted to the role because it didn 't require a 22 @-@ episode commitment like a series on a broadcast network . " That was huge for me ! " she said . " I wasn 't about to commit to , you know , six months . It was cable , rather than network ... I 've been offered network [ shows ] before , and determined not to do it , just because I can 't make that kind of time commitment . " 
 Dylan McDermott was cast as the lead Ben Harmon in late April 2011 . His character was initially described as " a handsome and masculine but sensitive therapist who loves his family but has hurt his wife . " McDermott stated that he wanted to do the role to break away from his previous role as Bobby Donnell in the ABC series The Practice . " This was exactly why I wanted to do this show – to change it up and do a different kind of character . People think of me as the guy from The Practice ... I wanted to turn that [ notion ] on its head and hopefully I 'm doing that [ with this show ] " , he said . 
 In May 2011 , Taissa Farmiga and Evan Peters were the last lead actors to be cast , portraying Violet Harmon and Tate Langdon , respectively . Farmiga said that she loved Violet " immediately " and that " she had spunk to her , she had attitude . " Murphy has described Tate as the " true monster " of the series , adding : " To Evan 's great credit and the credit of the writers , I think Evan 's done an amazingly difficult job making a monster sympathetic . "

 The pilot episode was shot on location in a house in Country Club Park , Los Angeles , California , which serves as the haunted house and crime scene in the series . Designed and built in 1902 by Alfred Rosenheim , the president of the American Institute of Architects ' Los Angeles chapter , the Tudor or Collegiate Gothic @-@ style single family home was previously used as a convent . An adjoining chapel was removed from exterior shots using CGI . 
 The series is filmed on sets that are an exact replica of the house . Details such as Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows , and hammered bronze light fixtures , were re @-@ created to preserve the look of the house . The house became available for rent on Airbnb in February 2016 . 
 Due to a " very aggressive " production schedule and the series ' pilot shoot having to wait for co @-@ creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk 's other show , Glee , to wrap its second season production , it was announced that the show 's first season finale , the thirteenth episode , would be thirty minutes shorter than planned . Finally , the thirteenth episode was dropped and they made the twelfth episode 10 minutes longer ( 52 minutes ) . The finale aired on December 21 , 2011 . 
 = = = Title sequence = = = 
 The opening title sequence was created by Kyle Cooper and his company Prologue . He also created the title sequence for the AMC series The Walking Dead and the 1995 film Se7en . The theme music was composed by sound designer Cesar Davila @-@ Irizarry and musician Charlie Clouser . The sequence is set in the Harmons ' basement and includes images of postmortem young children , unborn ( or aborted ) babies in jars , skulls , a Christening dress , a nurse 's uniform , and a figure holding a pair of bloody hedge clippers .

 = Battle of Kopidnadon = 
 The Battle of Kopidnadon or <unk> took place in September 788 between the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire . The Abbasid army launched an invasion of Byzantine Asia Minor , and was confronted by a Byzantine force at Kopidnadon . The resulting battle was an Abbasid victory . Among the Byzantine losses was a certain Diogenes , who is identified by some scholars with the probable original source for the literary hero Digenes Akritas . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ever since the failure of the last Arab attempt to conquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople , regular , almost annual raids were undertaken by the Caliphate 's forces into Byzantine Asia Minor . In 782 , a major invasion , led by the Abbasid heir apparent , the future Harun al @-@ Rashid ( r . 786 – 809 ) , resulted in a humiliating settlement for Byzantium , which was forced to sue for a truce in exchange for an annual payment of 160 @,@ 000 gold nomismata . In 785 , Empress @-@ regent Irene of Athens resolved to cease the payment of the tribute , and warfare recommenced . The Arabs raided the Armeniac Theme , but in early 786 the Byzantines retaliated by sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia , which the Abbasids had spent the last five years turning into a major stronghold and military base for their cross @-@ border expeditions against Byzantium . 
 = = Battle = = 
 With Harun al @-@ Rashid 's accession in 786 , the raids launched over the next two years were relatively minor affairs ; the first great invasion of the new reign occurred in 788 , when a large expeditionary force crossed the Cilician Gates into the Anatolic Theme . Although the raid is not mentioned in Arabic sources , its description by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor points to a major invasion , as it was confronted by the forces of the two most powerful Byzantine thematic armies , those of the Anatolic Theme itself and of the Opsician Theme . 
 The site of the battle is called " Kopidnadon " in Theophanes , a name otherwise unattested . Modern scholars , beginning with Henri Grégoire in 1932 , have identified it with the town of <unk> , on the western exit of the Cilician Gates . According to the brief account of Theophanes , the battle ended in a bloody defeat for the Byzantines , who lost many men and officers , including members of the tagma of the Scholai who had been banished to the provinces by Irene in 786 for their continued support of Iconoclasm . Theophanes also singles out the loss of the capable officer Diogenes , a tourmarches ( division commander ) of the Anatolics . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The immediate impact of the Byzantine defeat seems to have been negligible ; losses were heavy but not unbearable , and the level of devastation of the region seems to have been minimal . In material terms , there is therefore little to distinguish the defeat at Kopidnadon from the " typical " Arab raid . It marks , however , a recommencement of large @-@ scale border warfare after the relative lull since 782 , which continued unabated until Harun 's death in 809 and the subsequent Abbasid civil war . 
 Perhaps the most long @-@ term consequence of the battle was the death of the tourmarches Diogenes : by virtue of his unusual prominence in Theophanes 's account , Henri Grégoire identified this Diogenes with the original archetype for the later epic hero Digenes Akritas . 
 = Erich Hartmann = 
 Erich Alfred Hartmann ( 19 April 1922 – 20 September 1993 ) , nicknamed " Bubi " by his German comrades and " The Black Devil " by his Soviet adversaries , was a German fighter pilot during World War II and is the most successful fighter ace in the history of aerial warfare . He flew 1 @,@ 404 combat missions and participated in aerial combat on 825 separate occasions . He claimed , and was credited with , shooting down 352 Allied aircraft — 345 Soviet and 7 American — while serving with the Luftwaffe . During the course of his career , Hartmann was forced to crash @-@ land his fighter 14 times due to damage received from parts of enemy aircraft he had just shot down or mechanical failure . Hartmann was never shot down or forced to land due to enemy fire . 
 Hartmann , a pre @-@ war glider pilot , joined the Luftwaffe in 1940 and completed his fighter pilot training in 1942 . He was posted to Jagdgeschwader 52 ( JG 52 ) on the Eastern Front and was fortunate to be placed under the supervision of some of the Luftwaffe 's most experienced fighter pilots . Under their guidance , Hartmann steadily developed his tactics , which earned him the coveted Ritterkreuz mit Eichenlaub , Schwertern und Brillanten ( Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds ) on 25 August 1944 for claiming 301 aerial victories . At the time of its presentation to Hartmann , this was Germany 's highest military decoration . 
 Hartmann scored his 352nd and last aerial victory at midday on 8 May 1945 , only hours before the war ended . Along with the remainder of JG 52 , he surrendered to United States Army forces and was turned over to the Red Army . In an attempt to pressure him into service with the Soviet @-@ friendly East German Volksarmee , he was tried on fabricated charges of war crimes and convicted , his conviction being posthumously voided by a Russian court as a malicious prosecution . Hartmann was sentenced to 25 years of hard labour and spent 10 years in various Soviet prison camps and gulags until he was released in 1955 . 
 In 1956 , Hartmann joined the newly established West German Luftwaffe in the Bundeswehr , and became the first Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 71 " Richthofen " . Hartmann resigned early from the Bundeswehr in 1970 , largely due to his opposition to the F @-@ 104 Starfighter deployment in the Luftwaffe and the resulting clashes with his superiors over this issue . In his later years , after his military career had ended , he became a civilian flight instructor . He died of natural causes on 20 September 1993 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Erich Hartmann was born on 19 April 1922 in <unk> , Württemberg , to Doctor Alfred Erich Hartmann and his wife , Elisabeth Wilhelmine <unk> . The economic depression that followed World War I in Germany prompted Doctor Hartmann to find work in Changsha , China , and Erich spent his early childhood there . The family was forced to return to Germany in 1928 , when the Chinese Civil War broke out . During World War II , Hartmann 's younger brother , Alfred , also joined the Luftwaffe , serving as a gunner on a Junkers Ju 87 in North Africa . He was captured by the British and spent four years as a prisoner of war . 
 Hartmann was educated at the Volksschule in Weil im Schönbuch ( April 1928 – April 1932 ) , the Gymnasium in Böblingen ( April 1932 – April 1936 ) , the National Political Institutes of Education in Rottweil ( April 1936 – April 1937 ) , and the Gymnasium in Korntal ( April 1937 – April 1940 ) , from which he received his Abitur . It was at Korntal that he met his wife @-@ to @-@ be , Ursula " <unk> " Paetsch . 
 Hartmann 's flying career began when he joined the glider training program of the fledgling Luftwaffe and was taught to fly by his mother , one of the first female glider pilots in Germany . The <unk> also owned a light aircraft but were forced to sell it in 1932 as the German economy collapsed . The rise to power of the Nazi Party in 1933 resulted in government support for gliding , and , in 1937 , Elisabeth Hartmann helped set up a flying school at Weil im Schönbuch , where 14 @-@ year @-@ old Hartmann became an instructor . In 1939 , he gained his pilot 's license , allowing him to fly powered aircraft . 
 = = Entry into the Luftwaffe = = 
 Hartmann began his military training on 1 October 1940 at the 10th Flying Regiment in <unk> . On 1 March 1941 , he progressed to the Luftkriegsschule 2 in Berlin @-@ Gatow , making his first flight with an instructor four days later , followed in just under three weeks by his first solo flight . He completed his basic flying training in October 1941 and began advanced flight training at pre @-@ fighter school 2 in <unk> @-@ <unk> on 1 November 1941 . There , Hartmann learned combat techniques and gunnery skills . His advanced pilot training was completed on 31 January 1942 , and , between 1 March 1942 and 20 August 1942 , he learned to fly the Messerschmitt Bf 109 at the Jagdfliegerschule 2 in Zerbst / Anhalt . 
 Hartmann 's time as a trainee pilot did not always go smoothly . On 31 March 1942 , during a gunnery training flight , he ignored regulations and performed some aerobatics in his Bf 109 over the Zerbst airfield . His punishment was a three @-@ month period of confinement to quarters with the loss of ⅔ of his pay in fines . Hartmann later recalled that the incident saved his life : 
 That week confined to my room actually saved my life . I had been scheduled to go up on a gunnery flight the afternoon that I was confined . My roommate took the flight instead of me , in an aircraft I had been scheduled to fly . Shortly after he took off , while on his way to the gunnery range , he developed engine trouble and had to crash @-@ land near the Hindenburg @-@ Kattowitz railroad . He was killed in the crash . 
 Afterward , Hartmann practised diligently and adopted a new credo which he passed on to other young pilots : " Fly with your head , not with your muscles . " During a gunnery practice session in June 1942 , he hit a target drogue with 24 of the allotted 50 rounds of machine @-@ gun fire , a feat that was considered difficult to achieve . His training had qualified him to fly 17 different types of powered aircraft , and , following his graduation , he was posted on 21 August 1942 to Ergänzungs @-@ Jagdgruppe Ost ( Supplementary Fighter Group , East ) in Gleiwitz , Upper Silesia , where he remained until 10 October 1942 .

 In October 1942 , Hartmann was assigned to fighter wing Jagdgeschwader 52 ( JG 52 ) , based at <unk> on the Eastern Front in the Soviet Union . The wing was equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109G , but Hartmann and several other pilots were initially given the task of ferrying Junkers Ju 87 Stukas down to <unk> . His first flight ended with brake failure , causing the Stuka to crash into and destroy the controller 's hut . Hartmann was assigned to III . / JG 52 , led by Gruppenkommandeur Major Hubertus von Bonin , and placed under the experienced Oberfeldwebel Edmund " Paule " Roßmann , although he also flew with such experienced pilots as Alfred Grislawski , Hans Dammers and Josef <unk> . After a few days of intensive mock combats and practice flights , Grislawski conceded that , although Hartmann had much to learn regarding combat tactics , he was quite a talented pilot . Paule Roßmann taught Hartmann the fundamentals of the surprise attack , a tactic that led to his " See – Decide – Attack – Break " style of aerial combat . 
 = = = Early aerial combat = = = 
 Hartmann flew his first combat mission on 14 October 1942 as Roßmann 's wingman . When they encountered 10 enemy aircraft below , Hartmann , obsessed by the idea of scoring his first success , opened full throttle and became separated from Roßmann . He engaged an enemy fighter , but failed to score any hits and nearly collided with it instead . He then ran for cover in low cloud , and his mission subsequently ended with a crash landing after his aircraft ran out of fuel . Hartmann had violated almost every rule of air @-@ to @-@ air combat , and von Bonin sentenced him to three days of working with the ground crew . Twenty @-@ two days later , Hartmann claimed his first kill , an Ilyushin Il @-@ 2 Sturmovik of the 7th Guards Ground Attack Aviation Regiment , but by the end of 1942 , he had added only one more victory to his tally . As with many high @-@ scoring aces , it took him some time to establish himself as a consistently successful fighter pilot . 
 Hartmann 's youthful appearance earned him the nickname " Bubi " , ( the hypocoristic form of " young boy " in the German language ) , and the ace Walter Krupinski , to whom Hartmann was assigned as wingman , would constantly urge him : " Hey , Bubi , get in closer " . On 25 May 1943 , he shot down a Lavochkin La @-@ 5 , before colliding with another Soviet fighter . However , he retained control of his damaged aircraft . On 7 July , during the large dogfights that took place during the Battle of Kursk , he shot down seven enemy aircraft . At the start of August 1943 , his tally stood at 50 , and by the end of the month , he had added 48 more enemy aircraft . The next month , he was appointed Staffelkapitän of 9 . / JG 52 . 
 In his first year of operational service , Hartmann felt a distinct lack of respect towards Soviet pilots . Most Soviet fighters did not even have proper gunsights , their pilots having to draw them on the windscreen by hand . " In the early days , incredible as it may seem , there was no reason for you to feel fear if the Russian fighter was behind you , " he later recalled . " With their hand @-@ painted " gunsights " they couldn 't pull the lead properly or hit you . " Hartmann also considered the P @-@ 39 , the P @-@ 40 , and the Hurricane to be inferior to the Fw 190 and Bf 109 , although they did provide the Soviets with valuable gunsight technology . 
 The German pilots themselves learned a few tricks from their enemy . Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf 109G @-@ 6s made them difficult to start in the extreme cold of the Russian winter . A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft 's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first try . Another solution , also learned from the Soviets , was to ignite fuel under the engine . 
 = = = Fighting techniques = = = 
 Unlike Hans @-@ Joachim Marseille , who was a marksman and expert in the art of deflection shooting , Hartmann was a master of stalk @-@ and @-@ ambush tactics . By his own account , he was convinced that 80 % of the pilots he downed did not even realise what hit them . He relied on the powerful engine of his Bf 109 for high @-@ power sweeps and quick approaches , occasionally diving through entire enemy formations to take advantage of the confusion that followed in order to disengage . 
 When the decorated British test pilot Captain Eric Brown asked Hartmann how he had amassed 352 air victories , he revealed : 
 Well you can 't believe it , but the Sturmovik , which was their main ground @-@ attack aircraft , flew like B @-@ 17s in formation and didn 't attempt to make any evasive manoeuvres . And all they had was one peashooter in the back of each plane . Also , some of the pilots were women . Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you . I didn 't open fire til the aircraft filled my whole windscreen . If I did this , I would get one every time . 
 His favourite method of attack was to hold fire until extremely close ( 20 m ( 66 ft ) or less ) , then unleash a short burst at point @-@ blank range — a technique he learned while flying as wingman of his former commander , Walter Krupinski , who favoured this approach . This technique , as opposed to long @-@ range shooting , allowed him to : 
 Reveal his position only at the last possible moment 
 <unk> for the low muzzle velocity of the slower @-@ firing 30 mm MK 108 equipping some of the later Bf 109 models ( though most of his victories were claimed with Messerschmitts equipped with the high @-@ velocity 20mm MG 151 cannon ) 
 Place his shots accurately with minimum waste of ammunition 
 Prevent the adversary from taking evasive actions 
 However , firing at close range ran the risk of having to fly through the debris of a damaged or exploding aircraft , thereby damaging his own fighter in the process ( much of the damage Hartmann sustained in combat was caused by collision with flying debris ) . If it was dangerous to dog @-@ fight further he would break off and content himself with one victory . His careful approach was described by himself by the motto : " See @-@ Decide @-@ Attack @-@ Reverse " ; observe the enemy , decide how to proceed with the attack , make the attack , and then disengage to re @-@ evaluate the situation . 
 = = = Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross = = = 
 By late August 1943 , Hartmann had 90 aerial victories . On 19 August , in combat with Il @-@ 2s , his aircraft was damaged by debris , and he was forced to land behind Soviet lines . Hartmann 's Geschwaderkommodore , Dietrich Hrabak , had given orders to Hartmann 's unit to support the dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 , led by the famous Stuka pilot Hans @-@ Ulrich Rudel in a counter @-@ attack . The situation had changed , and the flight of eight German fighters engaged a mass of Soviet Yakovlev Yak @-@ 9 and Lavochkin La @-@ 5 fighter aircraft that were protecting Il @-@ 2 <unk> on a ground @-@ attack mission . Hartmann shot down two enemy aircraft before his fighter was hit by debris and he was forced to make an emergency landing . He then , in accordance with Luftwaffe regulations , attempted to recover the precision board clock . As he was doing so , Soviet ground troops approached . Realising that capture was unavoidable , he faked internal injuries . Hartmann 's acting so convinced the Soviets that they put him on a stretcher and placed him on a truck . When Hartmann 's Crew Chief , Heinz " <unk> " Mertens , heard what had happened , he took a rifle and went to search for Hartmann . 
 Hartmann patiently waited for the right moment to escape , then , using the distraction of the Stukas attack , he attacked the single guard . Hartmann jumped out of the back of the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers . Evading the pursuing soldiers , Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall . In the dark , Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front . As he approached the German position , he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers . 
 On 20 September 1943 , Hartmann was credited with his 100th aerial victory . He was the 54th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark . In October 1943 , Hartmann claimed another 33 aerial victories , and , on 29 October , he was awarded the Ritterkreuz , at which point his tally stood at 148 . By the end of the year , this had risen to 159 . In the first two months of 1944 , Hartmann claimed another 50 kills . Hartmann continued scoring at an even greater pace . His spectacular rate of kills raised a few eyebrows even in the Luftwaffe High Command ; his claims were double and triple @-@ checked , and his performance closely monitored by an observer flying in his formation . On 2 March , he reached 202 . By this time , the Soviet pilots were familiar with Hartmann 's radio call sign of Karaya 1 , and the Soviet Command had put a price of 10 @,@ 000 rubles on the German pilot 's head . Hartmann , for a time , used a black tulip design around the engine cowling near the spinner of his aircraft , so Soviet personnel consequently nicknamed him <unk> <unk> ( " Black Devil " ) . However , Hartmann 's opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if they noticed his personal design . As a result , this aircraft was often allocated to novices , who could fly it in relative safety . On 21 March , it was Hartmann who scored JG 52 's <unk> victory of the war . Adversely , the reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight caused Hartmann 's kill rate to drop . Hartmann then had the tulip design removed , and his aircraft painted just like the rest of his unit . Consequently , in the following two months , Hartmann amassed over 50 victories . 
 In March 1944 , Hartmann , Gerhard Barkhorn , Walter Krupinski and Johannes Wiese were summoned to Adolf Hitler 's Berghof in Berchtesgaden . Barkhorn was to be honoured with the Swords , while Hartmann , Krupinski and Wiese were to receive the Oak Leaves to the Knight 's Cross . On the train , all four of them got drunk on cognac and champagne . Supporting each other and unable to stand , they arrived at Berchtesgaden . Major Nicolaus von Below , Hitler 's Luftwaffe adjutant , was shocked . After some sobering up , Hartmann was still intoxicated . Hartmann took a German officer 's hat from a stand and put it on , but it was too large . Von Below became upset , told Hartmann it was Hitler 's and ordered him to put it back . 
 = = = Mustangs over Romania = = = 
 On 21 May 1944 , Hartmann engaged United States Army Air Forces aircraft in Reichsverteidigung for the first time in defence of the Ploiești oilfields . While flying " top cover " for another Schwarm , Hartmann attacked a flight of four P @-@ 51s over Bucharest , Romania , downing two , while the other two P @-@ 51s fell victim to his fellow pilots . On 1 June 1944 , Hartmann shot down four P @-@ 51s in a single mission over the Ploieşti oil fields . Later that month , during his fifth combat with American pilots , he shot down two more P @-@ 51s before being forced to bail out , when eight other P @-@ 51s ran his Messerschmitt out of fuel . During the intense manoeuvring , Hartmann managed to line up one of the P @-@ 51s at close range , but heard only a " clank " when he fired , as he had run out of ammunition . While he was hanging in his parachute , the P @-@ 51s circled above him , and Hartmann wondered if they would take this opportunity to kill him . One of the P @-@ <unk> flown by Lt. Robert J. Goebel of the 308th Squadron , 31st Fighter Group , broke away and headed straight for him . Goebel was making a camera pass to record the bailout and banked away from him only at the last moment , waving at Hartmann as he went by . On 17 August , Hartmann became the top scoring fighter ace , surpassing fellow JG 52 pilot Gerhard Barkhorn , with his 274th victory . 
 = = = The Diamonds to the Knight 's Cross = = = 
 On 23 August , Hartmann claimed eight victories in three combat missions , an ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day achievement , bringing his score to 290 victories . He passed the 300 @-@ mark on 24 August 1944 , a day on which he shot down 11 aircraft in two combat missions , representing his greatest ever victories @-@ per @-@ day ratio ( a double @-@ ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day ) and bringing the number of aerial victories to an unprecedented 301 . He was immediately grounded by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring , who was fearful of the effect on German morale should such a hero be lost . Hartmann , however , later successfully lobbied to be reinstated as a combat pilot . 
 Hartmann became one of only 27 German soldiers in World War II to receive the Diamonds to his Knight 's Cross . Hartmann was summoned to the Führerhauptquartier Wolfsschanze , Adolf Hitler 's military headquarters near Rastenburg , to receive the coveted award from Hitler personally . On arrival , he was asked to surrender his side arm — a security measure caused by the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt on 20 July 1944 . Hartmann refused and threatened to decline the Diamonds if he were not trusted to carry his pistol . After consulting Oberst Nicolaus von Below , Hitler 's Luftwaffe adjutant , Hartmann was allowed to keep his side arm and accepted the Diamonds . During Hartmann 's meeting with Hitler , Hartmann discussed at length the shortcomings of fighter pilot training . Allegedly , Hitler revealed to Hartmann that he believed that , " militarily , the war is lost , " and that he wished the Luftwaffe had " more like him and Rudel . " 
 The Diamonds to the Knight 's Cross also earned Hartmann a 10 @-@ day leave . On his way to his vacation , he was ordered by General der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland to attend a meeting in Berlin @-@ Gatow . Galland wanted to transfer Hartmann to the Messerschmitt Me 262 test program . Hartmann requested that the transfer be cancelled on the grounds of his deep attachment to JG 52 . Galland , valuing comradeship and seeing the merit in Hartmann 's request , cancelled the transfer to the jet squadron and rescinded the order that had taken him off combat operations . Galland then ordered Hartmann to the <unk> ( vacation resort for fighter pilots ) in Bad Wiessee , where , on 10 September , Hartmann married his long @-@ time teenage love , Ursula " <unk> " Paetsch . Witnesses to the wedding included his friends Gerhard Barkhorn and Wilhelm Batz . 
 = = = Last combat missions = = = 
 From 1 – 14 February 1945 , Hartmann briefly led I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 53 as acting Gruppenkommandeur until he was replaced by Helmut <unk> . In March 1945 , Hartmann , his score now standing at 336 aerial victories , was asked a second time by General Adolf Galland to join the Me 262 units forming to fly the new jet fighter . Hartmann attended the jet conversion program led by Heinrich Bär . Galland also intended Hartmann to fly with Jagdverband 44 . Hartmann declined the offer , preferring to remain with JG 52 . Some sources report that Hartmann 's decision to stay with his unit was due to a request via telegram made by Oberstleutnant Hermann Graf . Now Gruppenkommandeur of I. / JG 52 , Erich Hartmann claimed his 350th aerial victory on 17 April , in the vicinity of <unk> . The last wartime photograph of Hartmann known was taken in connection with this victory . 
 At the end of the war , Erich Hartmann disobeyed General Hans Seidemann 's order to Hartmann and Hermann Graf to fly to the British sector to avoid capture by Soviet forces . Hartmann later explained : 
 I must say that during the war I never disobeyed an order , but when General Seidemann ordered Graf and me to fly to the British sector and surrender to avoid the Soviets , with the rest of the wing to surrender to the Soviets , I could not leave my men . That would have been bad leadership . 
 Hartmann 's last kill occurred over Brno , Czechoslovakia , on 8 May , the last day of the war in Europe . Early that morning , he was ordered to fly a reconnaissance mission and report the position of Soviet forces . Hartmann took off with his wingman at 08 : 30 and spotted the first Soviet units just 40 kilometres ( 25 miles ) away . Passing over the area , Hartmann saw two Yak @-@ 9s performing aerobatics for the Soviet columns . Determined to " spoil the party " , Hartmann dove upon the fighters from his vantage point at 12 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) and shot one down from a range of 200 ft ( 61 m ) . As he lined up the second fighter , Hartmann noticed a flicker of shiny dots above him coming from the West ; they were P @-@ 51s . Rather than make a stand and be caught between the Soviets and the Americans , Hartmann and his wingman fled at low level into the pall of smoke that covered Brno . When he landed , Hartmann learned that the Soviet forces were within artillery range of the airfield , so JG 52 destroyed Karaya One , 24 other Bf 109s , and large quantities of ammunition . Hartmann later recalled his final violent action of the war : 
 We destroyed the aircraft and all munitions , everything . I sat in my fighter and fired the guns into the woods where all the fuel had been dropped , and then jumped out . We destroyed twenty @-@ five perfectly good fighters . They would be nice to have in museums now . 
 As Gruppenkommandeur of I. / JG 52 , Hartmann chose to surrender his unit to members of the US 90th Infantry Division . 
 = = Prisoner of war = = 
 After his capture , the U.S. Army handed Hartmann , his pilots , and ground crew over to the Soviet Union on 24 May , where he was imprisoned in accordance with the Yalta Agreements , which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them . Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open @-@ air compound to await the transfer . The number of prisoners grew to 50 @,@ 000 . Living conditions deteriorated , and some American guards turned a blind eye to escapes . In some cases they assisted by providing food and maps . 
 Soon after being handed over to the Soviet armed forces , Hartmann experienced the following : 
 The first thing the Russians did was to separate the German women and girls from the men . What followed was a brutal orgy of rape and debauchery by Red Army soldiers . When the greatly outnumbered Americans tried to intervene , the Russians charged towards them firing into the air and threatening to kill them if they interfered . The raping continued throughout the night . The next day a Russian General arrived at the encampment and immediately ordered a cessation ... Later when a few Russians violated the order again and assaulted a German girl , she was asked to identify them from a lineup . There were no formalities , no court martial . The guilty parties were immediately hanged in front of all their comrades . The point was made . 
 Initially , the Soviets tried to convince Hartmann to cooperate with them . He was asked to spy on fellow officers and become a <unk> , or " stool pigeon " . He refused and was given 10 days ' solitary confinement in a four @-@ by @-@ nine @-@ by @-@ six @-@ foot chamber . He slept on a concrete floor and was given only bread and water . On another occasion , the Soviets threatened to kidnap and murder his wife ( the death of his son was kept from Hartmann ) . During similar interrogations about his knowledge of the Me 262 , Hartmann was struck by a Soviet officer using a cane , prompting Hartmann to slam his chair down on the head of the assailant , knocking him out . Expecting to be shot , he was transferred back to the small bunker . 
 Hartmann , not ashamed of his war service , opted to go on a hunger strike and starve rather than fold to " Soviet will " , as he called it . The Soviets allowed the hunger strike to go on for four days before force @-@ feeding him . More subtle efforts by the Soviet authorities to convert Hartmann to communism also failed . He was offered a post in the East German Air Force , which he refused : 
 If , after I am home in the West , you make me a normal contract offer , a business deal such as people sign every day all over the world , and I like your offer , then I will come back and work with you in accordance with the contract . But if you try to put me to work under coercion of any kind , then I will resist to my dying gasp . 
 = = = War crimes charges = = = 
 During his captivity Hartmann was first arrested on 24 December 1949 , and three days later , he was sentenced to 20 years in prison . 
 In June 1951 he was sentenced as an alleged member of an anti @-@ Soviet group . 
 After continuous failed attempts by the Soviets to break him , Hartmann was falsely charged with war crimes , specifically the " deliberate shooting of 780 Soviet civilians " in the village of <unk> , attacking a " bread factory " on 23 May 1943 , and destroying 345 " expensive " Soviet aircraft . He refused to confess to these charges and conducted his own defence , which the presiding judge denounced as a " waste of time " . 
 Sentenced to 25 years of hard labor , Hartmann refused to work . He was eventually put into solitary confinement , which enraged his fellow prisoners . They began a revolt , overpowered the guards , and freed him . Hartmann made a complaint to the <unk> 's office , asking for a representative from Moscow and an international inspection , as well as a tribunal , to acquit him of his unlawful conviction . This was refused , and he was transferred to a camp in <unk> , where he spent five more months in solitary confinement . Eventually , Hartmann was granted a tribunal , but it upheld his original sentence . He was subsequently sent to another camp , this time at <unk> in the Ural Mountains . 
 In 1955 , Hartmann 's mother wrote to the new West German Chancellor , Konrad Adenauer , to whom she appealed to secure his freedom . A trade agreement between West Germany and the Soviet Union was reached , and Hartmann was released along with 16 @,@ 000 German military personnel as one of the last <unk> . After spending 10 and a half years in Soviet POW camps , he was among the last batch of prisoners to be turned over . Returning to West Germany , he was reunited with his wife Ursula , to whom he had written every day of the war . 
 In January 1997 , the government of the Russian Federation , acting as the legal successor to the Soviet Union , exonerated Hartmann by admitting that his conviction for war crimes was unlawful .

 When Hartmann returned to West Germany , he reentered military service in the Bundeswehr and became an officer in the West German Air Force ( Luftwaffe ) , where he commanded West Germany 's first all @-@ jet unit , Jagdgeschwader 71 " Richthofen " , which was equipped initially with Canadair Sabres and later with Lockheed F @-@ 104 Starfighters . He also made several trips to the United States , where he was trained on U.S. Air Force equipment . He had the JG 71 aircraft painted with the same spreading black tulip pattern used by Karaya 1 on the Eastern Front . 
 Hartmann considered the F @-@ 104 a fundamentally flawed and unsafe aircraft and strongly opposed its adoption by the Luftwaffe . Although events subsequently validated his low opinion of the aircraft ( 282 crashes and 115 German pilots killed on the F @-@ 104 in non @-@ combat missions , along with allegations of bribes culminating in the Lockheed scandal ) , Hartmann 's outspoken criticism proved unpopular with his superiors . General Werner <unk> , successor to General Josef Kammhuber as Inspekteur der Luftwaffe , said , " Erich is a good pilot , but not a good officer . " Hartmann was forced into early retirement in 1970 . 
 = = = Civilian life = = = 
 During his long imprisonment , Hartmann 's son , Erich @-@ Peter , was born in 1945 and died as a three @-@ year @-@ old in 1948 , without his father ever having seen him . Hartmann later had a daughter , Ursula Isabel , born on 23 February 1957 . 
 After his military retirement , from 1971 – 74 , Hartmann worked as a flight instructor in Hangelar , near Bonn , and also flew in an aerobatics team with Adolf Galland . In 1980 he caught a cold that developed into angina pectoris — the condition that had killed his father at the age of 58 . He recovered and , by 1983 , was medically cleared to fly , after which he resumed instructing at the various flying schools . However , fearing a second attack , he became cautious and limited his appearances at public events . He stated : " I am retired and I am a civilian , and now I like to have my rest and peace . I do not live for exhibitions . " Hartmann was a member of the Gemeinschaft der Jagdflieger ( Association of German Armed Forces Airmen ) . 
 Hartmann died on 20 September 1993 , at the age of 71 in Weil im Schönbuch . 
 = = Summary of career = = 
 = = = Combat record = = = 
 Hartmann flew 1 @,@ 404 combat missions during World War II , resulting in 825 engagements and 352 claimed and credited aerial victories against Allied aircraft . One Russian historian , Dimitri Khazanov , has attempted to prove that Hartmann did not score anywhere near 352 victories . Khazanov quoted Hartmann having shot down 70 @-@ 80 Soviet aircraft . However , Khazanov has been heavily criticised by aviation historians such as Jean @-@ Yves <unk> and Hans Ring for faulty research . Ring and <unk> both point out that the missions that Khazanov tried to use to prove Hartmann 's claims false were riddled with false and misleading information . For example , Khazanov claimed that on a mission on 20 August 1943 , Hartmann claimed two victories west of <unk> but not a single Soviet aircraft was lost . German records show not a single claim was made in that area . Hartmann 's victories were recorded east of <unk> , some 160 kilometres ( 99 mi ) away . On 29 May 1944 , Khazanov claimed Hartmann reported three La @-@ 5s shot down over Roman , Romania . This was also false . Hartmann claimed a single P @-@ 39 over Iaşi . Hans Ring said the mistakes in Khazanov 's work " serve to expose the superficial nature of Khazanov 's assertions and confirm that his only goal in compiling his article was to discredit Hartmann and his record . " Even Khazanov points out in his article that during Hartmann 's show trial , one of the Soviet charges was the destruction of 352 ( the actual number was 345 ) Soviet aircraft . 
 It is often said that Hartmann was more proud of the fact that he had never lost a wingman in combat than he was about his number of kills ; however , he did have at least one shot down . Major Günther Capito had joined the unit in the spring of 1943 . Capito was a former bomber pilot who had retrained on fighters . After scoring his fifth victory , Capito asked to be Hartmann 's wingman . Hartmann refused initially , believing Capito was insufficiently trained on Messerschmitts . On their first mission together , they were engaged by P @-@ 39 Airacobras : 
 I called to him to turn hard opposite , so I could sandwich the Red fighters , but in his standard @-@ rate bomber turn he got hit . I saw the whole thing and ordered him to dive and bail out immediately . To my intense relief I saw him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom . I was happy to get this Airacobra , but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito .

 Live is a live album by American singer Usher . It was recorded on October 15 and 16 , 1998 in the singer 's hometown of Chattanooga , Tennessee , and released by LaFace Records on March 23 , 1999 . Both audio @-@ only and video longform versions were released ; it was distributed to break up the gap between Usher 's second and third studio albums , My Way ( 1997 ) and 8701 ( 2001 ) . 
 Live received generally negative reviews from critics ; many criticized the poor live sound of Usher 's voice on the album . Live reached number 73 on the Billboard 200 , number 30 on the Top R & B Albums and number 3 on the Top Music Videos . The album has sold over 200 @,@ 000 copies in the United States , and both the audio and video versions have been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .

 Live was released to keep Usher 's fans satisfied during the four @-@ year break between My Way ( 1997 ) and 8701 , his second and third studio albums , respectively . During that time , Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty ( 1998 ) , Light It Up ( 1999 ) and Texas Rangers ( 2001 ) . The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed in his hometown of Chattanooga , Tennessee on October 15 and 16 , 1998 . Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV , " I really like the sound of a band , that 's one , just for myself , but there were so many people who didn 't get a chance to see the concert , so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album , and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn 't get a chance to see the performance , and a little bio of me as well . " Seven of the songs included on Live are from Usher 's self @-@ titled debut album ( 1994 ) and My Way . A medley of songs originally performed by Bobby Brown — " Don 't Be Cruel " , " Every Little Step " , " Rock Wit 'cha " and " Roni " — is also featured on the album , along with covers of Force MDs ' " Tender Love " and LL Cool J 's " I Need Love " . 
 Live was released in the United States by LaFace Records on March 23 , 1999 by means of compact disc , cassette and VHS formats ; along with the concert footage , the VHS features interviews with Usher . The audio version Live was later serviced to digital retailers for music download .

 = Archie McKellar = 
 Squadron Leader Archibald Ashmore McKellar DSO , DFC & Bar ( 10 April 1912 – 1 November 1940 ) was a flying ace of the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) during the Second World War . 
 McKellar grew up and joined the family business in his native Scotland , but in 1936 , aged 24 , he joined the RAF and began pilot training . He completed his training in 1938 and was assigned to No. 602 ( City of Glasgow ) Squadron RAF , an Auxiliary Unit . In 1939 he converted to the Supermarine Spitfire fighter . He experienced his first combat with No. 602 Squadron on Monday 16 October 1939 during a Luftwaffe raid on shipping in the Firth of Forth . McKellar 's first combat sortie was notable for being the first ever flown by Spitfires . Later the same day , in a second sortie , he claimed the second RAF air @-@ to @-@ air victory in ' British skies ' of WWII . On Saturday 28 October 1939 McKellar was involved in the first RAF air @-@ to @-@ air victory over UK mainland soil in WWII . 
 McKellar gained further fame in 1940 during the Battle of Britain as a part of , and later squadron leader of , No. 605 Squadron RAF , equipped with the Hawker Hurricane fighter . The Auxiliary Unit was moved to southern England and participated in the large air battles . McKellar 's combat career proved to be very brief , lasting just over a year . He claimed all but two of his victories within the last two and a half months of his life ; 15 August – 1 November 1940 . On 7 October 1940 he shot down five Messerschmitt Bf 109s , thus becoming an ace in a day ; one of only 24 Allied aces to achieve the feat . At the time of his last mission he had claimed 21 aerial victories and another two shared destroyed against enemy aircraft . Included in this total of 21 air victories are 11 Bf 109s . McKellar was one of two British pilot to achieve the feat of " Ace in a Day " during the Battle of Britain . On 1 November 1940 — one day after the official end of the Battle of Britain — he was killed in action . He took off and engaged a formation of German fighters , one of which he possibly shot down for his 22nd — albeit uncredited — and final victory . McKellar was then shot down himself . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Archibald Ashmore ( " Archie " ) McKellar was born in Paisley , Renfrewshire , Scotland on the 10 April 1912 , the son of John and Margaret McKellar , of Bearsden , Dunbartonshire and was then educated at Shawlands Academy in the Southside of Glasgow . Upon leaving school he joined a local stockbroker 's firm . This did not suit McKellar , who preferred an open – air life style . Keen to leave , but unsure of what direction to take in life , he joined his father 's general contractor and construction business as a plasterer . He spent five years as an apprentice plasterer . During this time he was given no special privileges despite being the boss ' son . 
 McKellar was also a keen fitness enthusiast and , despite his short stature , built up a great physical strength . Though he enjoyed wine and smoked the occasional pipe or cigar he kept in peak physical shape until his death . Even at the height of the Battle of Britain he was always clean shaven and immaculately dressed . McKellar 's spare time was used reading about sport and First World War fighter pilots . His interest in the flying personalities of the past spurred him to take up flying . He joined at his own expense the Scottish Flying Club , which had been founded in 1927 ; it leased and managed Renfrew Airport from 1933 until it was requisitioned during the Second World War . McKellar quickly acquired a pilot 's licence . By the time he began his military career , McKellar was a very experienced pilot , and he soon began earning relatively quick promotions . 
 = = Joining the AAF and RAF = = 
 His flying skills earned him the attention of Lord Clydesdale , Commanding Officer of No. 602 Squadron AAF . Clydesdale invited McKellar to join the Auxiliary Air Force ( AAF ) and was soon commissioned into the RAF as a Pilot Officer on 8 November 1936 , joining No. 602 ( City of Glasgow ) Squadron RAF . McKellar 's comrades affectionately nicknamed him " Shrimp " owing to his short , 5 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 60 m ) , stature . McKellar stayed with the Squadron and on 8 May 1938 was promoted to Flying Officer . 
 Based at RAF Abbotsinch near Paisley , the squadron operated the Hawker Hind light bomber . The members of squadron — both pilots and ground staff — were reservists and completed their service on a part @-@ time basis , in the evenings , weekends and an annual two – week summer camp . With the approach of war , the squadron converted to a fighter role and re @-@ equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire . It mobilised on the outbreak of war at RAF Grangemouth on 6 October 1939 and then to RAF Drem a month later , charged with defending Edinburgh and the shipping area around the Firth of Forth . 
 Upon completing training McKellar was deemed to have exceptional eyesight which earned him a reputation as a good marksman in air @-@ to @-@ air combat . Yet , paradoxically , when shooting with his rifle he was a well below average shot – a trait he shared with some other successful pilots . MacKellar was a keen sportsman . He believed physical fitness was a critical attribute in aerial combat ; fitness , he believed , would ensure that the mind and body were always at their peak of alertness , and enable a pilot to react swiftly within a fluid battle situation . 
 McKellar was also considered a capable leader in combat . Aggressive and instinctive , his fighting spirit was an inspiration to his squadron but according to one biographer , he was highly strung , vociferous and blunt with members of his unit . Nevertheless , his directness and socially confident nature singled him out for command . His dedication to his job as a fighter pilot and leader led him to refuse any leave from his Squadron while the Battle of Britain lasted . Invariably McKellar led from the front of his unit . He spent a large proportion of his time with his squadron practising combat tactics . While intensely loyal to anyone he considered a friend , McKellar 's attitude to others outside the squadron was either of utmost friendliness or utter dislike . He is said to have tended to see everything and everyone in black and white .

 At 10 : 21 hours on Monday 16 October 1939 as part of Blue Section , 602 Squadron , Archie McKellar and his section leader , Flight Lieutenant George Pinkerton , intercepted a reconnaissance Heinkel He 111 of Kampfgeschwader 26 ' <unk> ' ( Lions ) over the Isle of May in the Firth of Forth . Together Pinkerton and McKellar fired 1 @,@ 720 rounds from their Spitfires ' .303 calibre Browning machine guns at the enemy aircraft , yet the Heinkel managed to escape . Pilot Officer Paul Webb , flying Blue 3 , was unable to get into an effective firing position against the intruder . Pinkerton and McKellar 's shots were the first fired in combat by RAF aircraft over the British Isles in WWII . Blue Section 's action was also the first combat mission ever to be flown by Spitfires . 
 Later that same day Pinkerton and McKellar were in action yet again . This time 602 was scrambled to intercept Junkers Ju 88 bombers of Kampfgeschwader 30 ' Adler ' ( Eagle ) as they attacked Royal Navy warships in the Forth near the Rosyth Naval Dockyard . The Luftwaffe 's target that day was the battlecruiser HMS Hood which was believed to be in the area . In fact the German reconnaissance had wrongly identified HMS Repulse which was now docked safely at Rosyth . At this stage of WWII German Bomber crews were under strict orders to avoid bombing targets which risked British civilian casualties , so Repulse was spared . However there were other available targets of opportunity out in the Forth , namely Town Class light cruisers HMS Edinburgh and HMS Southampton plus other warships including the Tribal Class Destroyer HMS Mohawk . The first flight of three Ju 88A @-@ 1s led by KG 30 's Gruppenkommandeur , Hauptmann Helmut Pohle began a dive @-@ bombing attack against these ships at 14 : 27 hours . With the British defences slow to respond to the German attack , 602 's Pinkerton and McKellar only managed to engage Pohle 's aircraft after he had attacked and inflicted damage on HMS Southampton . Pohle was observing the bombing runs of his other aircraft , whilst circling north of the Forth Bridge above Inverkeithing , when 602 caught up with him . In a shared attack , McKellar fired the final burst , knocking out the Junkers ' port engine . Pohle limped eastwards but was forced to ditch his aircraft in the Forth , coming down three miles east of Crail off the coast of Fife . Pohle survived , but the action claimed the lives of his three crew members . Seventeen year old Gefreiter August Schleicher and Unteroffizier Kurt <unk> ( nineteen ) , whose bodies were recovered , were accorded military funerals with full honours . RAF pipers played ' Over the Sea to Skye ' as a lament . Originally interred at Portobello Cemetery , their remains were moved in 1959 to the German Military Cemetery at Cannock Chase , Staffordshire . The body of Pohle 's Observer , Feldwebel Werner Weise , was not recovered . Archie McKellar was credited with the victory , which was logged by the Royal Observer Corps as being at 14 @.@ 55 hours , missing by just ten minutes the downing of the first enemy aircraft over Britain in WWII . That honour had fallen to Flight Lieutenant Patrick ' Patsy ' Gifford , from 602 's brothers in arms , and friendly rivals , 603 ( City of Edinburgh ) Squadron ; also auxiliaries . Gifford had shot down the Ju 88 of Oberleutnant Hans <unk> at 14 @.@ 45 hours during the same action . Following the 16 October success , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of Fighter Command , Air Marshal Hugh Dowding telegraphed ; " Well done , first blood to the auxiliaries . " The area around the Firth of Forth soon became referred to as ' suicide alley ' by the Luftwaffe pilots who were operating at the limit of their range and far beyond any fighter cover . 
 On Saturday 28 October 1939 Flying Officer McKellar was on patrol leading Red Section of 602 when anti @-@ aircraft fire alerted them to the presence of a Heinkel He 111 over the Forth . Together with a section from 603 Squadron ( led by ' Patsy ' Gifford ) they gave chase . The Spitfires soon caught up with the Heinkel , which had been hit by the flak directed at it , and lined up to attack the intruder as it attempted to flee south . Piloted by Unteroffizier Kurt Lehmkuhl , the Heinkel , code 1H + JA , of Stab . / KG 26 desperately tried to evade the faster and more manoeuvrable fighters . Acting on the advice of his navigator and commander Leutnant Rolf Niehoff , Lehmkuhl dived down towards what sparse cloud cover was available . In the pursuit , McKellar became separated from the other two aircraft in his section . The Heinkel 's cover , however , quickly dispersed and McKellar and the Spitfires of Gifford 's 603 section closed in for the kill , raking the enemy aircraft with their fire . Both the Heinkel 's engines were damaged and air gunners Gefreiter Bruno Reimann and Unteroffizier <unk> <unk> were killed . Lehmkuhl was wounded in the back by machine gun fire but somehow managed to pilot his stricken aircraft to successfully crash @-@ land near the village of <unk> in East Lothian . Niehoff and Lehmkuhl both survived to become prisoners of war . Debate continues to this day as to which squadron or pilot could claim the victory , but officially McKellar was awarded a share , along with each of the three 603 pilots . The ' <unk> Heinkel ' was the first enemy aircraft to be downed onto British soil by the RAF in WWII . 
 = = = 605 Squadron = = = 
 In early 1940 , No. 605 ( County of Warwick ) Squadron moved to RAF Drem , as they converted to Hurricanes . McKellar was transferred to No. 605 and promoted to Flight Lieutenant , assuming the responsibilities of a flight leader on 21 June 1940 . McKellar imposed strict discipline , both in standard of dress on the ground and in tactical discipline in the air . Despite his strict methods McKellar was held in high regard . His popularity arose from his desire to help mould his unit into a well @-@ disciplined fighting team . 
 On 15 August 1940 No. 605 intercepted a German raid against Tyneside mounted by He 111s based in Norway with Luftflotte 5 ( Air Fleet 5 ) . McKellar was credited with three He 111s destroyed during the encounter . For this action he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) and was gazetted on 13 September 1940 which made reference to the " outstanding leadership and courage " displayed by <unk> . 
 On 7 September 1940 , No. 605 moved on rotation to Croydon Aerodrome under the command of Squadron Leader Walter Churchill . McKellar scored a further four victories in a single mission on 9 September . McKellar attacked with the sun at his back with his Squadron , save for one Section which was left to provide top cover against Bf 109s . The attack was made head @-@ on to break up the German bomber formation which consisted of a large mass of He 111s . He destroyed three He 111s with a single , 12 – second burst . The first He 111 exploded . It damaged a second which rolled over and dived down into the ground . McKellar then moved his fire to a third . Its port wing snapped off . He then destroyed a Bf 109 in the afternoon giving him a fourth success . 
 McKellar took over from Squadron Leader Churchill on the 11 September . He achieved a further three victories 15 September . The raids were made in large formation leading the fighting that day to be christened the Battle of Britain Day . McKellar led 605 into combat twice on that date claiming two Bf 109s and a Do 17 . That night , at an hour past midnight , 16 September , he claimed another He 111 shot down . A Medal bar to the DFC followed which cited his " excellent fighting spirit ... particularly brilliant tactician , and his led his Squadron with skill and resource " . 
 On 3 October McKellar became one of the select few pilots of Fighter Command to sit for one of Cuthbert Orde 's charcoal portraits . On 7 October his score rose by five victories , all Bf 109s — becoming an Ace in a day . McKellar explained three of the five victories in the combat that day in his combat report ; 
 I attacked the Number One and saw a bomb being dropped from this machine . I fired and pieces fell off his wing and dense white smoke and vapour came from him and he went into a violent outside spin . In my mirror I could see another ' 109 coming to attack me and therefore turned sharply right and found myself behind another ' 109 . I opened fire and saw my De Wilde ( explosive ammunition ) hitting his machine . It burst into flames and went down inverted east of Biggin Hill . As I again had a ' 109 on my tail I spiralled down to 15 @,@ 000 feet and by this time there appeared to be ' 109s straggling all over the sky . I followed one , pulled my boost control and made up on him . I gave him a burst from dead astern and at once his radiator appeared to be hit as dense white vapour came back at me and my windscreen fogged up . This speedily cleared and I gave him another burst and this machine burst into flames and fell into a wood with a quarry near it , west of Maidstone . 
 Thirteen days later , on 20 October 1940 , McKellar brought down another Bf 109 . Its pilot , Feldwebel Adolf Iburg from 9 Staffel Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 54 — Fighter Wing 54 ) , was slightly wounded in action . Iburg managed to force – land near New Romney and was captured . The victory was credited to him in a post @-@ war account , but there is no official accreditation of the Iburg victory to McKellar by the RAF , though he was credited with another Bf 109 victory on that date . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 By 1 November 1940 McKellar had claimed 21 victories . Taking a section of No. 605 that included Flight Lieutenant Bob Foster , up to meet a flight of Bf 109 <unk> ( Bf 109s equipped with bombs ) . The section climbed to high altitude to meet the enemy aircraft . In the ensuing battle it is believed McKellar was shot down by II . / Jagdgeschwader 27 ( JG 27 — Fighter Wing 27 ) Hauptmann ( Captain ) Wolfgang Lippert . McKellar 's Hurricane <unk> ( <unk> ) crashed at the side of Woodlands Manor near <unk> , Kent at 08 : <unk> . Lippert rightly claimed <unk> at 09 @.@ 15 in Canterbury area ( OKL + <unk> <unk> 4 / I @-@ <unk> ) . 
 On 8 November 1940 his actions brought a final award — the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) . His DSO was gazetted posthumously on 26 November 1940 and again cited both ' outstanding courage and determination ' in leading his squadron . Further recognition came in a Mention in Despatches gazetted on 31 December 1940 . 
 On 16 January 1941 Sir Archibald Sinclair , Secretary of State for Air , visited Glasgow to deliver the eulogy ; 
 Not long ago I visited a fighter squadron which was taking part during the dark days in the battle of this island . That squadron lost its leader in an air fight — and they felt the loss . He had been wounded in combat and had been withdrawn from service . I found in his place , taking to the air with daring resolve , proving himself a leader amongst leaders , a young Scot . His name was Archie McKellar . He had come from the City of Glasgow Squadron to lift up this squadron in its dark hour and to carry it on to fresh victories and achievement by his spirit . It was quite apparent to me that he had the whole squadron with him . He was regarded with the greatest admiration and affection by his officers . I will never forget the impression he made upon me when I saw him . 
 As McKellar died outside the Air Ministry " nominal " dates for the Battle of Britain ( 10 July — 31 October 1940 ) , he is not listed on the Battle of Britain roll of honour at The RAF Chapel , Westminster Abbey . McKellar is buried at New Eastwood Cemetery , Thornliebank , East Renfrewshire , by Glasgow . 
 = = List of victories = = 
 Historian Alfred Price credited McKellar with 17 air victories , three shared destroyed , five probably destroyed and three damaged . Historians Christopher Shores and Clive Williams credit him with 21 air victories , three probably destroyed and three damaged as does <unk> Baker . In his last combat they credit him with a possible 22nd victory , since a Bf 109 crashed in the area of his last combat and no RAF pilot made a claim . John Foreman credits him with at least 17 victories and acknowledges the unclaimed Bf 109 that crashed on 1 November 1940 near to McKellar might have been his last victory . Chaz Bowyer , another prolific historian and writer on RAF personnel credits McKellar with at least 20 victories . 
 During the period he flew Hurricane <unk> , McKellar scored 13 victories and shared one more destroyed , four probable and one damaged , between 15 August and 7 October 1940 . Thus earned the distinction of being the Hurricane with the highest number of kills during the Battle of Britain . It was later handed over to a Czech unit , No. 312 Squadron RAF on 4 January 1941 and written off in an accident on 30 April 1941 . 
 = Peter Jeffrey ( RAAF officer ) = 
 Peter Jeffrey , DSO , DFC ( 6 July 1913 – before 10 April 1997 ) was a senior officer and fighter ace in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Born in Tenterfield , New South Wales , he joined the RAAF active reserve in 1934 , and transferred to the Permanent Air Force ( PAF ) shortly before World War II . Posted to the Middle East in July 1940 , Jeffrey saw action with No. 3 Squadron and took command of the unit the following year , earning the Distinguished Flying Cross for his energy and fighting skills . He was appointed wing leader of No. 234 Wing RAF in November 1941 , and became an ace the same month with his fifth solo victory . The next month he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his achievements , which included rescuing a fellow pilot who had crash landed in the desert . 
 In 1942 , Jeffrey was posted to the South West Pacific , where he helped organise No. 75 Squadron for the defence of Port Moresby , and No. 76 Squadron prior to the Battle of Milne Bay . He served two stints in charge of No. 2 Operational Training Unit in southern Australia before the end of the war , broken by command of No. 1 ( Fighter ) Wing in the Northern Territory and Western Australia during 1943 – 44 , at which time he was promoted to temporary group captain . Jeffrey was transferred to the RAAF reserve after the war but returned to the PAF in 1951 , holding training posts in Victoria and command of RAAF Base Edinburgh in South Australia , before resigning in 1956 . Outside the military , he was a grazier and stockbroker . He died in 1997 , aged 83 .

 The son of A.L. Jeffrey , Peter Jeffrey was born in Tenterfield , New South Wales , on 6 July 1913 . He was educated at Church of England Preparatory School in Toowoomba , Queensland , and at Cranbrook in Sydney . Having spent time as a jackaroo , by 1934 he was in his first year of engineering studies at Sydney University , residing in St Andrew 's College . In December that year , he enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve , known as the Citizen Air Force ( CAF ) . 
 Jeffrey undertook flying instruction on the 1935 ' B ' ( reservists ) course conducted by No. 1 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton , and was commissioned as a pilot officer in July . Serving with No. 22 ( City of Sydney ) Squadron from July 1936 , he transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force ( PAF ) on a short @-@ service commission in May 1938 . He was then assigned to No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook , Victoria , as an instructor . In January 1939 , he was posted to Britain to attend the Specialists Signals Course at Royal Air Force College Cranwell , and was promoted to flight lieutenant in September . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Completing his course at Cranwell in November 1939 , Jeffrey returned to Australia the following January as Signals Officer with No. 3 ( Army Cooperation ) Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond , New South Wales . He resumed flying duties in June 1940 , and posted out to the Middle East as a flight commander with No. 3 Squadron on 15 July . 
 = = = Middle East = = = 
 Sailing via Bombay , India , No. 3 Squadron arrived at Suez , Egypt , in late August 1940 . Along with most of his comrades , Jeffrey flew obsolescent Gloster Gladiator biplanes in support of the Australian 6th Division during the North African Campaign , but he claimed no victories at this stage . Promoted squadron leader , he took over No. 3 Squadron from Wing Commander Ian McLachlan on 13 February 1941 , by which time the unit had converted to Hawker Hurricane monoplane fighters . Based at RAF Benina in defence of Benghazi when Jeffrey assumed command , No. 3 Squadron retreated eastwards only hours ahead of German tanks after Rommel launched his offensive in April . The Australians were forced to use ten different airfields in as many days before the Allies regrouped . 
 Jeffrey was flying a Hurricane when he claimed his first aerial victory on 15 April 1941 . Following a flight of four German Junkers Ju 52 transports back to their base near Fort Capuzzo , Libya , he shot one down before it landed and strafed the other three on the ground , setting all on fire . He was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) for this exploit , as well as his " untiring efforts " and " high standard of efficiency ... under extremely trying conditions " ; the award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 13 May . After converting to P @-@ 40 Tomahawks the same month , No. 3 Squadron took part in the Syria @-@ Lebanon Campaign . Jeffrey scored the unit 's first victory in the new fighter when he shot down in flames an Italian Junkers Ju 88 over the sea near Beirut on 13 June 1941 . Within two days he had followed this up by destroying a Vichy French Martin 167 bomber in southern Syria . Jeffrey was credited with another Ju 88 before the squadron returned to North Africa in September to support the Allied counter @-@ attack against the Afrika Korps . He was mentioned in despatches on 24 September 1941 . 
 As commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron , Jeffrey came up with innovative ways of improving morale in the face of living conditions that were " primitive at best " . On one occasion he arranged accommodation for his men near a beach , well away from the din of night @-@ time bombing that was causing them to lose sleep on a regular basis . Another of his more " radical ideas " and lasting legacies was a combined mess for all pilots in the combat zone , whether commissioned or non @-@ commissioned . The concept was initially frowned upon by Royal Air Force units , but when Air Vice Marshal " Mary " Coningham dined at the shared mess on 11 October 1941 and gave his approval , it took root across the entire Desert Air Force ; leading ace Clive Caldwell later put the same idea into practice as commander of the RAAF 's No. 1 ( Fighter ) Wing in Darwin , Northern Territory . One of No. 3 Squadron 's flight sergeants recalled that Jeffrey made it a rule for new pilots to get to know their ground crew to increase their sense of comradeship , and also gave one of his senior warrant officers special responsibility for keeping track of the location of Allied airfields and petrol supplies to ensure that the unit was never short of fuel or places to land in an emergency . 
 Having been promoted to temporary wing commander and appointed wing leader of No. 234 Wing RAF earlier in the month , Jeffrey was credited with a share in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter on 20 November . Two days later he was shot down himself , but was uninjured and managed to make his way back to base . On 25 November , above cheering Allied soldiers besieged in Tobruk , Jeffrey led No. 3 Squadron and No. 112 Squadron RAF in an attack on Axis bombers that resulted in seven enemy aircraft being destroyed and eight damaged , against one Tomahawk lost . He scored his fifth solo victory during the engagement , shooting down a Bf 110 , and damaged another . On 30 November , Jeffrey rescued one of his old comrades from No. 3 Squadron , Sergeant Pilot Allan Cameron , who had crash @-@ landed behind enemy lines . Nicknamed " Tiny " , Cameron had the bulkiest frame of any man in the unit , and after landing Jeffrey had to ditch his parachute to make room for his passenger in the Tomahawk 's cockpit . He nevertheless managed to take off and return to base , and Cameron went on to survive the war and become an ace in the process . For this and other achievements Jeffrey was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 12 December 1941 . As well as his rescue of the downed pilot , the citation paid tribute to his " great success " as wing leader , his " fine fighting spirit " in returning to base after having been shot down himself , and to his " magnificent leadership , fearlessness and skill " that had " contributed in a large measure to the successes achieved " . At the end of the month , Jeffrey was posted back to Australia to serve in the South West Pacific . He was credited with a total of five aerial victories in the Middle East , plus one shared and one damaged , though he was considered to be " conservative " in his scoring . 
 = = = South West Pacific = = = 
 Arriving in Australia in January 1942 , Jeffrey briefly took charge the following month of RAAF Bankstown , New South Wales . On 4 March he became the inaugural commander of No. 75 ( Fighter ) Squadron , operating newly delivered P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks . Forming the squadron in Townsville , Queensland , Jeffrey was responsible for readying it for the defence of Port Moresby , which would become one of the crucial early battles in the New Guinea campaign . Although it included two other veterans of No. 3 Squadron in the Middle East , Flight Lieutenants " Old John " Jackson and Peter Turnbull , most of the unit 's pilots were untried , and Jeffrey had only nine days to instil in them basic principles of combat flying , gunnery and tactics . He handed over command to Jackson on 19 March , but assisted in ferrying the Kittyhawks to Moresby two days later , only to be fired upon by nervous anti @-@ aircraft gunners as he came in to land with Turnbull and two other pilots . All four aircraft were damaged , and Jeffrey came within inches of death as a bullet flew past his skull and into the headrest of his seat . By 24 March , No. 75 Squadron had already shot down several Japanese raiders ; having witnessed it " quickly established as a fighting unit " , Jeffrey returned to Australia . He immediately began working up a second new Kittyhawk unit for service in New Guinea , No. 76 ( Fighter ) Squadron . Based in Townsville at this stage , it was subsequently commanded by Peter Turnbull and joined No. 75 Squadron in the Battle of Milne Bay . 
 In April 1942 , Jeffrey was appointed to establish and command No. 2 Operational Training Unit ( No. 2 OTU ) . Initially based at Port Pirie , South Australia , the unit relocated to Mildura , Victoria , the following month , training pilots for combat in such aircraft as Kittyhawks , CAC Boomerangs and Supermarine Spitfires . Its instructors under Jeffrey included aces Clive Caldwell and Wilf Arthur . Jeffrey married Colleen Crozier at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 14 May ; his best man was fellow ace and No. 3 Squadron veteran Alan Rawlinson . The couple had two sons , Rod and Tim . In August 1943 , Jeffrey took charge of No. 5 Fighter Sector Headquarters , based in Darwin , Northern Territory . On 25 September , he took over from Caldwell as Officer Commanding No. 1 ( Fighter ) Wing , comprising three Spitfire squadrons whose role was to defend North @-@ Western Area ( NWA ) from air attack . By this time , Japanese raids had declined in strength and frequency , and Allied forces in the NWA shifted from a defensive posture to assaulting Japanese positions in the Dutch East Indies and Western New Guinea . No. 1 Wing intercepted some raiders in late September but none came in October ; the last Japanese attack on northern Australia took place on 12 November . Jeffrey was promoted to temporary group captain in December . 
 On 8 March 1944 , Jeffrey urgently dispatched two of his squadrons to the vicinity of Perth , Western Australia , in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force would raid the area , but it proved to be an abortive sortie ; no attack ensued , and the squadrons were directed to return to Darwin on 20 March . He led the wing in its first offensive strafing operation on 18 April , attacking Japanese positions in the Babar Islands . The next month , he deployed his headquarters and two squadrons to Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia to protect facilities that had been established to refuel the British Eastern Fleet prior to Operation Transom . On 5 September 1944 , Jeffrey led No. 1 Wing to the Tanimbar Islands and strafed targets in Selaru . Later he discussed the mission with Caldwell , who was then commanding No. 80 ( Fighter ) Wing and had tagged along to determine if such long @-@ range operations might be worthwhile for his squadrons . Jeffrey declared that the trip was a wasted effort and he had only undertaken it to prevent , in Caldwell 's words , " the morale of his pilots going completely down the drain " . The following month , Jeffrey was recommended to be mentioned in despatches for " Gallant & distinguished service " in North @-@ Western Area ; the award was gazetted on 9 March 1945 . Departing No. 1 Wing , in November he returned to the command of No. 2 OTU , in which role he saw out the rest of the war . 
 = = Post @-@ war career = = 
 Following the cessation of hostilities , No. 2 OTU was reduced to the status of a care and maintenance unit , and Jeffrey 's commission was terminated on 6 June 1946 . Having been transferred to the RAAF reserve upon his demobilisation , he sought readmission to the PAF in August the same year , without success . He then took up farming , purchasing a property on the Murray River . In April 1951 he again applied to rejoin the PAF and this time was granted a commission as a wing commander . Over the next two years he held training posts in Victoria , firstly at the RAAF Staff College , Point Cook , and in 1952 at Central Flying School , East Sale . The following year he became Deputy Director of Operations at RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne . 
 Raised to acting group captain in February 1954 , Jeffrey was appointed Superintendent , Air , with the Long @-@ Range Weapons Establishment in Salisbury , South Australia . Coordinating weapons trials at Woomera Rocket Range , Jeffrey and his support staff were based initially at RAAF Base Mallala but later relocated to Edinburgh airfield , then part of Salisbury and owned by the Department of Supply . On 17 January 1955 , he became the inaugural Officer Commanding RAAF Base Edinburgh , and oversaw the transfer of units from Mallala during the year . He handed over command of the base in April 1956 , and resigned from the Air Force on 14 May . Returning to private life , Jeffrey settled in Queensland and became partner in a stock broking firm at Surfers Paradise . He later became a grazier , running a sheep and cattle property at Emerald in Queensland 's Central Highlands . He moved back to Surfers Paradise in 1972 , where he died in 1997 at the age of 83 , survived by his wife and sons . His obituary in the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 April described him as the " archetypal Australian combat leader ... fearless , forthright , unpretentious , caring " . 
 = Al @-@ Mansur Abu Bakr = 
 Al @-@ Malik al @-@ Mansur Sayf ad @-@ Din Abu Bakr ( Arabic : الملك <unk> سيف الدين أبو بكر ) , better known as al @-@ Mansur Abu Bakr ( Arabic : <unk> أبو بكر ) , ( ca . 1321 – November 1341 ) was the Bahri Mamluk sultan in 1341 . From an early age , Abu Bakr received military training in the desert town of al @-@ Karak . His father , Sultan an @-@ Nasir Muhammad ( r . 1310 – 41 ) , groomed him as a potential successor to the throne and made him an emir in 1335 . He was consistently promoted in the following years , becoming the na 'ib ( governor ) of al @-@ Karak in 1339 . He became the first son of an @-@ Nasir Muhammad to succeed him as sultan , although his reign was short @-@ lived . A few months after Abu Bakr 's accession , he was deposed and arrested by his father 's senior emir , Qawsun . Abu Bakr was imprisoned in the Upper Egyptian city of Qus with several of his brothers in August 1341 , and was executed on Qawsun 's orders two months later . He was succeeded by his younger half @-@ brother , al @-@ Ashraf Kujuk , but Qawsun was effectively the strongman of Egypt . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Abu Bakr was born around 1321 to his father sultan father an @-@ Nasir Muhammad ( r . 1310 – 1341 ) and his concubine mother , Narjis . Narjis also gave birth to Abu Bakr 's younger full brothers Ramadan ( died 1343 ) and Yusuf ( died 1346 ) . Information about Abu Bakr 's early childhood is unavailable in the Mamluk sources . The first mention of Abu Bakr came in 1332 . At that time , Abu Bakr had been sent to the desert fortress of al @-@ Karak to join his half @-@ brothers Ahmad and Ibrahim in their military training . Also during that year , Abu Bakr left al @-@ Karak to accompany his father and half @-@ brothers Anuk and Ahmad at al @-@ Aqaba and from there to Mecca to perform the Hajj pilgrimage . However , an @-@ Nasir Muhammad had them return to al @-@ Karak before the trek to Mecca . 
 In 1335 , Abu Bakr was recalled to Cairo and made an emir by his father . The event was marked by a royal procession , led by Emir Qawsun , in which Abu Bakr was dressed in the attire of an emir . At around the same time , an @-@ Nasir Muhammad arranged Abu Bakr 's marriage to a daughter of Emir <unk> al @-@ Hamawi , who married Narjis sometime earlier . Later , during his 59 @-@ day reign as sultan , Abu Bakr also married two slave girls , spending 100 @,@ 000 gold dinars for each of their bridal veils . In 1337 / 38 , Abu Bakr was promoted to an amir <unk> 'in ( emir of forty [ mounted mamluks ] ) . 
 Abu Bakr was sent back to al @-@ Karak in 1339 to replace Ahmad as na 'ib of the province . By then , Ahmad had been dropped by an @-@ Nasir Muhammad as a potential successor . Anuk remained the sultan 's favored son to replace him , but with Ahmad deemed unfit to rule , Abu Bakr became the runner @-@ up . Sometime that year , Abu Bakr paid a visit to his father with a gift of 200 @,@ 000 silver dirhams that he apparently extorted from the inhabitants of al @-@ Karak . He later returned to al @-@ Karak where he remained until 17 July 1340 . At that point , Anuk had been dropped as a potential successor by the sultan , who invited Abu Bakr back to Cairo . There , an @-@ Nasir Muhammad had his emirs swear an oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr . 
 Abu Bakr then set off for al @-@ Karak until he was recalled to Cairo once more in 1341 , arriving on 24 January . When he returned , he brought his father a sum of 100 @,@ 000 dirhams , while an @-@ Nasir Muhammad issued another order recalling all of Abu Bakr 's mamluks and soldiers in al @-@ Karak to Cairo . Abu Bakr remained in Cairo effectively to wait for his ailing father to die . In the months prior to an @-@ Nasir Muhammad 's death , Abu Bakr was given a large iqta ( fief ) , his interests were put under the care of Emir Bashtak and he was transferred a large number of <unk> ( immigrant , typically Mongol , soldiers ) from Aleppo and other troops . On 4 June 1341 , while on his deathbed , an @-@ Nasir Muhammad had all of his emirs recognize the transfer of the sultanate to Abu Bakr in the event of his death . Moreover , he <unk> Abu Bakr as " al @-@ Malik al @-@ Mansur " , the title of the latter 's grandfather , Sultan Qalawun ( r . 1277 – 90 ) , and gave him Qalawun 's sword . The throne was peacefully passed to Abu Bakr when an @-@ Nasir Muhammad died on 7 June . 
 = = Reign = = 
 Although Abu Bakr was made sultan , the reins of power were held by an @-@ Nasir Muhammad 's senior emirs , chief among whom were his son @-@ in @-@ law Qawsun and Bashtak . According to historian Amalia Levanoni , Abu Bakr sought to restore the traditional concepts of mamluk @-@ master relations and the modes of hierarchical advancement set by his grandfather Qalawun and abrogate the growing independence of the emirs that developed under his father . However , the post @-@ Qalawun mamluk norms of conduct proved too resilient for Abu Bakr . In the view of the emirs and the low and middle @-@ ranking mamluks , Abu Bakr was to solely play the role of a figurehead and not disturb the system created by his father . Thus , Abu Bakr 's attempts to rule in his own right were consistently stymied by the emirs . Of the latter , the most prominent was Qawsun , who sought to become the mudabbir ad @-@ dawla ( organizer of the state ) , in effect the strongman of the sultanate . After neutralizing Bashtak , his principal rival , Qawsun moved against Abu Bakr ; Qawsun had feared that Abu Bakr would attempt to imprison him . 
 On 5 August 1341 , Qawsun had Abu Bakr arrested on concocted charges of frivolity . Abu Bakr and six of his brothers were subsequently sent to prison in Qus in Upper Egypt . In November 1341 , Abu Bakr was executed by the governor of Qus on orders from Qawsun . After his death , Qawsun installed Abu Bakr 's infant half @-@ brother , Kujuk , as sultan and became the Kujuk 's regent . Meanwhile , dissent mounted against Qawsun in Syria and Cairo and he was ousted in a revolt , along with Kujuk . The new sultan , Abu Bakr 's half @-@ brother Ahmad , later had Qawsun and the governor of Qus ( who apologized for killing Abu Bakr ) executed in early 1342 . 
 = Anna Laetitia Barbauld = 
 Anna Laetitia Barbauld ( / <unk> / , by herself possibly / <unk> / , as in French , née Aikin ; 20 June 1743 – 9 March 1825 ) was a prominent English poet , essayist , literary critic , editor , and children 's author . 
 A " woman of letters " who published in multiple genres , Barbauld had a successful writing career at a time when female professional writers were rare . She was a noted teacher at the Palgrave Academy and an innovative children 's writer ; her primers provided a model for pedagogy for more than a century . Her essays demonstrated that it was possible for a woman to be publicly engaged in politics , and other women authors such as Elizabeth <unk> emulated her . Barbauld 's literary career spanned numerous periods in British literary history : her work promoted the values of both the Enlightenment and Sensibility , and her poetry was foundational to the development of British Romanticism . Barbauld was also a literary critic , and her anthology of 18th @-@ century British novels helped establish the canon as known today . 
 Barbauld 's career as a poet ended abruptly in 1812 with the publication of Eighteen Hundred and Eleven , which criticised Britain 's participation in the Napoleonic Wars . Vicious reviews shocked Barbauld , and she published nothing else during her lifetime . Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later , more conservative , years . Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children 's writer during the 19th century , and largely forgotten during the 20th century , but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Barbauld was born on 20 June 1743 at Kibworth Harcourt in Leicestershire to Jane and John Aikin . She was named after her maternal grandmother and referred to as " Nancy " ( an 18th @-@ century nickname for Anna ) . She was baptised by her mother 's brother , John Jennings , in Huntingdonshire two weeks after her birth . Barbauld 's father was headmaster of the Dissenting academy in Kibworth Harcourt and minister at a nearby Presbyterian church . She spent her childhood in what Barbauld scholar William McCarthy describes as " one of the best houses in Kibworth and in the very middle of the village square " ; she was much in the public eye , as the house was also a boys ' school . The family had a comfortable standard of living . McCarthy suggests they may have ranked with large freeholders , well @-@ to @-@ do tradesmen , and manufacturers . At his death in 1780 , Barbauld 's father 's estate was valued at more than £ 2 @,@ 500 . 
 Barbauld commented to her husband in 1773 that " For the early part of my life I conversed little with my own Sex . In the Village where I was , there was none to converse with . " Barbauld was surrounded by boys as a child and adopted their high spirits . Her mother attempted to quash these , which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman ; according to Lucy Aikin 's memoir , what resulted was " a double portion of <unk> and <unk> reserve " in Barbauld 's character . Barbauld was never quite comfortable with her identity as a woman and always believed that she failed to live up to the ideal of womanhood ; much of her writing would center around issues central to women and her " outsider " perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity during the 18th century . 
 Barbauld demanded that her father teach her the classics and after much pestering , he did . Thus she had the opportunity to learn Latin , Greek , French , Italian , and many other subjects generally deemed unsuitable for women at the time . Barbauld 's penchant for study worried her mother , who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism ; the two were never as close as Barbauld and her father . Yet Barbauld 's mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter : " I once indeed knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her , and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book , roundly , without spelling ; and in half a year more could read as well as most women ; but I never knew such another , and I believe never shall . " 
 Barbauld 's brother , John Aikin , described their father as " the best parent , the wisest counsellor , the most affectionate friend , every thing that could command love and veneration " . Barbauld 's father prompted many such tributes , although Lucy Aikin described him as excessively modest and reserved . Barbauld developed a strong bond with her brother during childhood , standing in as a mother figure to him ; they eventually became literary partners . In 1817 , Joanna Baillie commented of their relationship " How few brothers and sisters have been to one another what they have been through so long a course of years ! " 
 In 1758 , the family moved to Warrington Academy , in Warrington , where Barbauld 's father had been offered a teaching position . It drew many luminaries of the day , such as the natural philosopher and Unitarian theologian Joseph Priestley , and came to be known as " the Athens of the North " for its stimulating intellectual atmosphere . One other luminary may have been the French revolutionary Jean @-@ Paul Marat ; school records suggest he was a " French master " there in the 1770s . He may also have been a suitor to Barbauld ; he allegedly wrote to John Aikin declaring his intention to become an English citizen and to marry her . Archibald Hamilton Rowan also fell in love with Barbauld and described her as , " possessed of great beauty , distinct traces of which she retained to the latest of her life . Her person was slender , her complexion exquisitely fair with the bloom of perfect health ; her features regular and elegant , and her dark blue eyes beamed with the light of wit and fancy . " Despite her mother 's anxiety , Barbauld received many offers of marriage around this time — all of which she declined . 
 = = First literary successes and marriage = = 
 In 1773 , Barbauld brought out her first book of poems , after her friends had praised them and convinced her to publish . The collection , entitled simply Poems , went through four editions in just one year and surprised Barbauld by its success . Barbauld became a respected literary figure in England on the reputation of Poems alone . The same year she and her brother , John Aikin , jointly published Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose , which was also well received . The essays in it ( most of which were by Barbauld ) were favourably compared to Samuel Johnson 's . 
 In May 1774 , despite some " misgivings " , Barbauld married Rochemont Barbauld ( 1749 – 1808 ) , the grandson of a French Huguenot and a former pupil at Warrington . According to Barbauld 's niece , Lucy Aikin : 
 [ H ] er attachment to Mr. Barbauld was the illusion of a romantic fancy — not of a tender heart . Had her true affections been early called forth by a more genial home atmosphere , she would never have allowed herself to be caught by crazy demonstrations of amorous rapture , set off with theatrical French manners , or have conceived of such exaggerated passion as a safe foundation on which to raise the sober structure of domestic happiness . My father ascribed that ill @-@ starred union in great part to the baleful influence of [ Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau 's ] ' Nouvelle Heloise , ' Mr. B. impersonating St. Preux . [ Barbauld ] was informed by a true friend that he had experienced one attack of insanity , and was urged to break off the engagement on that account . — ' Then ' answered she , ' if I were now to disappoint him , he would certainly go mad . ' To this there could be no reply ; and with a kind of desperate generosity she rushed upon her melancholy destiny . 
 After the wedding , the couple moved to Suffolk , near where Rochemont had been offered a congregation and a school for boys . Barbauld took this time and rewrote some of the psalms , a common pastime in the 18th century , publishing them as Devotional Pieces Compiled from the Psalms and the Book of Job . Attached to this work is her essay " Thoughts on the Devotional Taste , on Sects and on Establishments " , which explains her theory of religious feeling and the problems inherent in the institutionalisation of religion . 
 It seems that Barbauld and her husband were concerned that they would never have a child of their own and in 1775 , after only a year of marriage , Barbauld suggested to her brother that they adopt one of his children : 
 I am sensible it is not a small thing we ask ; nor can it be easy for a parent to part with a child . This I would say , from a number , one may more easily be spared . Though it makes a very material difference in happiness whether a person has children or no children , it makes , I apprehend , little or none whether he has three , or four ; five , or six ; because four or five are <unk> [ sic ] to exercise all his whole stock of care and affection . We should gain , but you would not lose . 
 Eventually her brother conceded and the couple adopted Charles ; it was for him that Barbauld wrote her most famous books : Lessons for Children ( 1778 – 79 ) and Hymns in Prose for Children ( 1781 ) . 
 = = Palgrave Academy = = 
 Barbauld and her husband spent eleven years teaching at Palgrave Academy in Suffolk . Early on , Barbauld was not only responsible for running her own household but also the school 's — she was accountant , maid , and housekeeper . The school opened with only eight boys but when the Barbaulds left in 1785 , around forty were enrolled , a testament to the excellent reputation the school had acquired . The Barbaulds ' educational philosophy attracted Dissenters as well as Anglicans . Palgrave replaced the strict discipline of traditional schools such as Eton , which often used corporal punishment , with a system of " fines and <unk> " and even , it seems likely , " juvenile trials , " that is , trials run by and for the students themselves . Moreover , instead of the traditional classical studies , the school offered a practical curriculum that stressed science and the modern languages . Barbauld herself taught the foundational subjects of reading and religion to the youngest boys and geography , history , composition and rhetoric , and science to higher grade levels . She was a dedicated teacher , producing a " weekly chronicle " for the school and writing theatrical pieces for the students to perform . Barbauld had a profound effect on many of her students ; one who went on to great success , William Taylor , a preeminent scholar of German literature , referred to Barbauld as " the mother of his mind . " 
 = = Political involvement and Hampstead = = 
 In September 1785 , the Barbaulds left Palgrave for a tour of France ; Rochemont 's mental health had been deteriorating and he was no longer able to carry out his teaching duties . In 1787 , they moved to Hampstead where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel . It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie , the playwright . Although no longer in charge of a school , the Barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education ; they often had one or two pupils living with them , who had been recommended by personal friends . 
 It was during this time , the heyday of the French Revolution , that Barbauld published her most radical political pieces . From 1787 to 1790 , Charles James Fox attempted to convince the House of Commons to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights . When this bill was defeated for the third time , Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets , An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts . Readers were shocked to discover that such a well @-@ reasoned argument should come from a woman . In 1791 , after William Wilberforce 's attempt to outlaw the slave trade failed , Barbauld published her Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq . On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade , which not only lamented the fate of the slaves but also warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British could expect if they did not abandon slavery . In 1792 , she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti @-@ war sermon entitled Sins of Government , Sins of the Nation which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation : " We are called upon to repent of national sins , because we can help them , and because we ought to help them . " 
 = = Stoke Newington and the end of a literary career = = 
 In 1802 , the Barbaulds moved to Stoke Newington where Rochemont took over the pastoral duties of the Chapel at Newington Green . Barbauld herself was happy to be nearer her brother , John , because her husband 's mind was rapidly failing . Rochemont developed a " violent antipathy to his wife and he was liable to fits of insane fury directed against her . One day at dinner he seized a knife and chased her round the table so that she only saved herself by jumping out of the window . " Such scenes repeated themselves to Barbauld 's great sadness and real danger , but she refused to leave him . Rochemont drowned himself in the nearby New River in 1808 and Barbauld was overcome with grief . When Barbauld returned to writing , she produced the radical poem Eighteen Hundred and Eleven ( 1812 ) that depicted England as a ruin . It was reviewed so viciously that Barbauld never published another work within her lifetime , although it is now often viewed by scholars as her greatest poetic achievement . Barbauld died in 1825 , a renowned writer , and was buried in the family vault in St Mary 's , Stoke Newington . After Barbauld 's death , a marble tablet was erected in the Newington Green Chapel with the following inscription : 
 = = Legacy = = 
 At her death , Barbauld was lauded in the Newcastle Magazine as " unquestionably the first [ i.e. , best ] of our female poets , and one of the most eloquent and powerful of our prose writers " and the Imperial Magazine declared " so long as letters shall be cultivated in Britain , or wherever the English language shall be known , so long will the name of this lady be respected . " She was favourably compared to both Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson , no mean feat for a woman writer in the 18th century . But by 1925 she was remembered only as a moralising writer for children , if that . It was not until the advent of feminist literary criticism within the academy in the 1970s and 1980s that Barbauld finally began to be included in literary history . 
 Barbauld 's remarkable disappearance from the literary landscape took place for a number of reasons . One of the most important was the disdain heaped upon her by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth , poets who in their youthful , radical days had looked to her poetry for inspiration , but in their later , conservative years dismissed her work . Once these poets had become canonised , their opinions held sway . Moreover , the intellectual ferment that Barbauld was an important part of — particularly at the Dissenting academies — had , by the end of the 19th century , come to be associated with the " philistine " middle class , as Matthew Arnold put it . The reformist 18th @-@ century middle class was later held responsible for the excesses and abuses of the industrial age . Finally , the Victorians viewed Barbauld as " an icon of sentimental saintliness " and " erased her political courage , her tough mindedness , [ and ] her talent for humor and irony " , a literary figure that modernists despised . 
 As literary studies developed into a discipline at the end of the 19th century , the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it ; according to this version of literary history , Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age . This view held sway for almost a century . Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s , Barbauld still did not receive her due . As Margaret Ezell explains , feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman — one who was angry , one who resisted the gender roles of her time , and one who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women . Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories and it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re @-@ examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice Barbauld had been . 
 Barbauld 's works fell out of print and no full @-@ length scholarly biography of her was written until William McCarthy 's Anna Letitia Barbauld : Voice of the Enlightenment in 2009 . 
 Her adopted son Charles grew up to be a doctor and chemist ; he married a daughter of Gilbert Wakefield . Their child , Anna Letitia Le Breton , wrote literary memoirs , including Memoir of Mrs. Barbauld , including Letters and Notices of her Family and Friends in 1874 . 
 = = Literary analysis = = 
 = = = Poetry = = = 
 Barbauld 's poetry , which addresses a wide range of topics , has been read primarily by feminist literary critics interested in recovering women writers who were important in their own time but who have been forgotten by literary history . Isobel Armstrong 's work represents one way to do such scholarship ; she argues that Barbauld , like other Romantic women poets : 
 ... neither consented to the idea of a special feminine discourse nor accepted an account of themselves as belonging to the realm of the nonrational . They engaged with two strategies to deal with the problem of affective discourse . First , they used the customary ' feminine ' forms and languages , but they turned them to analytical account and used them to think with . Second , they challenged the male philosophical traditions that led to a demeaning discourse of feminine experience and remade those traditions . 
 In her subsequent analysis of " Inscription for an Ice @-@ House " she points to Barbauld 's challenge of Edmund Burke 's characterisation of the sublime and the beautiful and Adam Smith 's economic theories in the Wealth of Nations as evidence for this interpretation . 
 The work of Marlon Ross and Anne K. Mellor represents a second way to apply the insights of feminist theory to the recovery of women writers . They argue that Barbauld and other Romantic women poets carved out a distinctive feminine voice in the literary sphere . As a woman and a Dissenter , Barbauld had a unique perspective on society , according to Ross , and it was this specific position that " obligated " her to publish social commentary . But , Ross points out , women were in a double bind : " they could choose to speak politics in nonpolitical modes , and thus risk greatly diminishing the clarity and pointedness of their political passion , or they could choose literary modes that were overtly political while trying to infuse them with a recognizable ' feminine ' decorum , again risking a softening of their political agenda . " Therefore Barbauld and other Romantic women poets often wrote " occasional poems " . These poems had traditionally commented , often satirically , on national events , but by the end of the 18th century they were increasingly serious and personal . Women wrote sentimental poems , a style then much in vogue , on personal occasions such as the birth of a child and argued that in commenting on the small occurrences of daily life , they would establish a moral foundation for the nation . Scholars such as Ross and Mellor maintain that this adaptation of existing styles and genres is one way that female poets created a feminine Romanticism . 
 = = = Political essays and poems = = = 
 Barbauld 's most significant political texts are : An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts ( 1790 ) , Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade ( 1791 ) , Sins of Government , Sins of the Nation ( 1793 ) , and Eighteen Hundred and Eleven ( 1812 ) . As Harriet Guest explains , " the theme Barbauld 's essays of the 1790s repeatedly return to is that of the constitution of the public as a religious , civic , and national body , and she is always concerned to emphasize the continuity between the rights of private individuals and those of the public defined in <unk> inclusive terms . " 
 For three years , from 1787 to 1790 , Dissenters had been attempting to convince Parliament to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts which limited the civil rights of Dissenters . After the repeal was voted down for the third time , Barbauld burst onto the public stage after " nine years of silence . " Her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone ; it opens , " we thank you for the compliment paid the Dissenters , when you suppose that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit , all such places will at once be filled with them . " She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men : " We claim it as men , we claim it as citizens , we claim it as good subjects . " Moreover , she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out , not anything inherent in their form of worship . Finally , appealing to British patriotism , she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in liberty . 
 In the following year , 1791 , after one of William Wilberforce 's many efforts to suppress the slave trade failed to pass Parliament , Barbauld wrote her Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade . In it , she calls Britain to account for the sin of slavery ; in harsh tones , she condemns the " Avarice " of a country which is content to allow its wealth and prosperity to be supported by the labour of enslaved human beings . Moreover , she draws a picture of the plantation mistress and master that reveals all of the failings of the " colonial enterprise : [ an ] indolent , voluptuous , monstrous woman " and a " degenerate , enfeebled man . " 
 In 1793 , when the British government called on the nation to fast in honour of the war , anti @-@ war Dissenters such as Barbauld were left with a moral quandary : " obey the order and violate their consciences by praying for success in a war they disapproved ? observe the Fast , but preach against the war ? defy the Proclamation and refuse to take any part in the Fast ? " Barbauld took this opportunity to write a sermon , Sins of Government , Sins of the Nation , on the moral responsibility of the individual ; for her , each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation because he or she constitutes part of the nation . The essay attempts to determine what the proper role of the individual is in the state and while she argues that " insubordination " can undermine a government , she does admit that there are lines of " conscience " that one cannot cross in obeying a government . The text is a classic consideration of the idea of an " unjust war . " 
 In Eighteen Hundred and Eleven ( 1812 ) , written after Britain had been at war with France for a decade and was on the brink of losing the Napoleonic Wars , Barbauld presented her readers with a shocking <unk> satire ; she argued that the British empire was waning and the American empire was waxing . It is to America that Britain 's wealth and fame will now go , she contended , and Britain will become nothing but an empty ruin . She tied this decline directly to Britain 's participation in the Napoleonic Wars : 
 This pessimistic view of the future was , not surprisingly , poorly received ; " reviews , whether in liberal or conservative magazines , ranged from cautious to patronizingly negative to outrageously abusive . " Barbauld , stunned by the reaction , retreated from the public eye . Even when Britain was on the verge of winning the war , Barbauld could not be joyous . She wrote to a friend : " I do not know how to rejoice at this victory , splendid as it is , over Buonaparte , when I consider the horrible waste of life , the mass of misery , which such gigantic combats must occasion . " 
 = = = Children 's literature = = = 
 Barbauld 's Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose for Children were a revolution in children 's literature . For the first time , the needs of the child reader were seriously considered . Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins so that children could easily read them and , even more important , she developed a style of " informal dialogue between parent and child " that would dominate children 's literature for a generation . In Lessons for Children , a four @-@ volume , age @-@ adapted reading primer , Barbauld employs the concept of a mother teaching her son . More than likely , many of the events in these stories were inspired by Barbauld 's experience of teaching her own son , Charles . But this series is far more than a way to acquire literacy — it also introduces the reader to " elements of society 's symbol @-@ systems and conceptual structures , inculcates an ethics , and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility . " Moreover , it exposes the child to the principles of " botany , zoology , numbers , change of state in chemistry ... the money system , the calendar , geography , meteorology , agriculture , political economy , geology , [ and ] astronomy . " The series was relatively popular and Maria Edgeworth commented in the educational treatise that she co @-@ authored with her father , Practical Education ( 1798 ) , that it is " one of the best books for young people from seven to ten years old , that has yet appeared . " 
 Some at the time saw Barbauld 's work as marking a shift in children 's literature from fantasy to didacticism . Sarah Burney , in her popular novel Traits of Nature ( 1812 ) , has the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Christina Cleveland remark , " Well , then ; you know fairy @-@ tales are forbidden pleasures in all modern school @-@ rooms . Mrs. Barbauld , and Mrs. Trimmer , and Miss Edgeworth , and a hundred others , have written good books for children , which have thrown poor Mother Goose , and the Arabian Nights , quite out of favour ; — at least , with <unk> and <unk> . " 
 Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose had , for children 's books , an unprecedented impact ; not only did they influence the poetry of William Blake and William Wordsworth , they were also used to teach several generations of school children . Children 's literature scholar William McCarthy states , " Elizabeth Barrett Browning could still quote the opening lines of Lessons for Children at age thirty @-@ nine . " Although both Samuel Johnson and Charles James Fox ridiculed Barbauld 's children 's books and believed that she was wasting her talents , Barbauld herself believed that such writing was noble and she encouraged others to follow in her footsteps . As Betsy Rodgers , her biographer explains , " she gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature , and by not lowering her standard of writing for children , she inspired others to write on a similar high standard . " In fact , because of Barbauld , Sarah Trimmer and Hannah More were inspired to write for poor children as well as organise a large @-@ scale Sunday School movement , Ellenor Fenn wrote and designed a series of readers and games for middle @-@ class children and Richard Lovell Edgeworth began one of the first systematic studies of childhood development which would culminate in not only an educational treatise authored by Maria Edgeworth and himself but also in a large body of children 's stories by Maria herself . 
 Barbauld also collaborated with her brother John Aikin on the six @-@ volume series Evenings at Home ( 1793 ) . It is a miscellany of stories , fables , dramas , poems , and dialogues . In many ways this series encapsulates the ideals of an Enlightenment education : " curiosity , observation , and reasoning . " For example , the stories encourage learning science through hands @-@ on activities ; in " A Tea Lecture " the child learns that tea @-@ making is " properly an operation of chemistry " and lessons on evaporation , and condensation follow . The text also emphasises rationality ; in " Things by Their Right Names , " a child demands that his father tell him a story about " a bloody murder . " The father does so , using some of the fictional tropes of fairy tales such as " once upon a time " but confounding his son with details such as the murderers all " had steel caps on . " At the end , the child realises his father has told him the story of a battle and his father comments " I do not know of any murders half so bloody . " Both the tactic of <unk> the world to force the reader to think about it rationally and the anti @-@ war message of this tale are prevalent throughout Evenings at Home . In fact , Michelle Levy , a scholar of the period , has argued that the series encouraged readers to " become critical observers of and , where necessary , vocal resisters to authority . " This resistance is learned and practised in the home ; according to Levy , " Evenings at Home ... makes the claim that social and political reform must begin in the family . " It is families that are responsible for the nation 's progress or regress . 
 According to Lucy Aikin , Barbauld 's niece , Barbauld 's contributions to Evenings at Home consisted of the following pieces : " The Young Mouse , " " The Wasp and Bee , " " Alfred , a drama , " " Animals and Countries , " " Canute 's Reproof , " " The Masque of Nature , " " Things by their right Names , " " The Goose and Horse , " " On Manufactures , " " The Flying @-@ fish , " " A Lesson in the Art of Distinguishing , " " The Phoenix and Dove , " " The Manufacture of Paper , " " The Four Sisters , " and " Live Dolls . " 
 = = = Editorial work = = = 
 Barbauld edited several major works towards the end of her life , all of which helped to shape the canon as known today . First , in 1804 she edited Samuel Richardson 's correspondence and wrote an extensive biographical introduction of the man who was perhaps the most influential novelist of the 18th century . Her " 212 @-@ page essay on his life and works [ was ] the first substantial Richardson biography . " The following year she edited Selections from the Spectator , Tatler , Guardian , and Freeholder , with a Preliminary Essay , a volume of essays emphasising " wit , " " manners " and " taste . " In 1811 , she assembled The Female Speaker , an anthology of literature chosen specifically for young girls . Because , according to Barbauld 's philosophy , what one reads when one is young is formative , she carefully considered the " delicacy " of her female readers and " direct [ ed ] her choice to subjects more particularly appropriate to the duties , the employments , and the dispositions of the softer sex . " The anthology is subdivided into sections such as " moral and didactic pieces " and " descriptive and pathetic pieces " ; it includes poetry and prose by , among others , Alexander Pope , Hannah More , Maria Edgeworth , Samuel Johnson , James Thomson and Hester Chapone . 
 But it was Barbauld 's fifty @-@ volume series of The British Novelists published in 1810 with her large introductory essay on the history of the novel that allowed her to place her mark on literary history . It was " the first English edition to make comprehensive critical and historical claims " and was in every respect " a canon @-@ making enterprise . " In her insightful essay , Barbauld legitimises the novel , then still a controversial genre , by connecting it to ancient Persian and Greek literature . For her , a good novel is " an epic in prose , with more of character and less ( indeed in modern novels nothing ) of the supernatural machinery . " Barbauld maintains that novel @-@ reading has a multiplicity of benefits ; not only is it a " domestic pleasure " but it is also a way to " infus [ e ] principles and moral feelings " into the population . Barbauld also provided introductions to each of the fifty authors included in the series .

 = Ardhanarishvara = 
 Ardhanarishvara ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् <unk> ् <unk> , Ardhanārīśvara ) is a composite androgynous form of the Hindu god Shiva and his consort Parvati ( also known as Devi , Shakti and Uma in this icon ) . Ardhanarishvara is depicted as half male and half female , split down the middle . The right half is usually the male Shiva , illustrating his traditional attributes . 
 The earliest Ardhanarishvara images are dated to the Kushan period , starting from the first century CE . Its iconography evolved and was perfected in the Gupta era . The Puranas and various iconographic treatises write about the mythology and iconography of Ardhanarishvara . While Ardhanarishvara remains a popular iconographic form found in most Shiva temples throughout India , very few temples are dedicated to this deity . 
 Ardhanarishvara represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe ( Purusha and Prakriti ) and illustrates how Shakti , the female principle of God , is inseparable from ( or the same as , according to some interpretations ) Shiva , the male principle of God . The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation . Another view is that Ardhanarishvara is a symbol of Shiva 's all @-@ pervasive nature . 
 = = Names = = 
 The name Ardhanarishvara means " the Lord who is half woman . " Ardhanarishvara is also known by other names like <unk> ( " the half man @-@ woman " ) , <unk> ( " the Lord who is half woman " ) , <unk> ( " the Lord of Dance who is half @-@ woman " ) , <unk> , <unk> ( " man @-@ woman " ) , <unk> ( a Tamil name meaning " Mother @-@ Father " ) , and <unk> ( in Assam , " the Lord whose half is a young woman or girl " ) . The Gupta @-@ era writer Pushpadanta in his <unk> refers to this form as <unk> ( " Thou and She art each the half of one body " ) . Utpala , commenting on the Brihat Samhita , calls this form Ardha @-@ <unk> ( " the Lord whose half is the fair one " ; the fair one – Gauri – is an attribute of Parvati ) . The Vishnudharmottara Purana simply calls this form <unk> ( " The Lord / husband of Gauri ) . 
 = = Origins and early images = = 
 The conception of Ardhanarishvara may have been inspired by Vedic literature 's composite figure of Yama @-@ Yami , the Vedic descriptions of the primordial Creator Vishvarupa or Prajapati and the fire @-@ god Agni as " bull who is also a cow , " the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 's Atman ( " soul " ) in the form of the androgynous cosmic man Purusha and the androgynous myths of the Greek Hermaphroditus and Phrygian <unk> . The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad says that Purusha splits himself into two parts , male and female , and the two halves copulate , producing all life – a theme concurrent in Ardhanarishvara 's tales . The Shvetashvatara Upanishad sows the seed of the Puranic Ardhanarishvara . It declares Rudra – the antecedent of the Puranic Shiva – the maker of all and the root of Purusha ( the male principle ) and Prakriti ( the female principle ) , adhering to Samkhya philosophy . It hints at his androgynous nature , describing him both as male and female . 
 The concept of Ardhanarishvara originated in Kushan and Greek cultures simultaneously ; the iconography evolved in the Kushan era ( 30 – 375 CE ) , but was perfected in the Gupta era ( 320 @-@ 600 CE ) . A mid @-@ first century Kushan era stela in the Mathura Museum has a half @-@ male , half @-@ female image , along with three other figures identified with Vishnu , Gaja Lakshmi and Kubera . The male half is ithyphallic or with an <unk> and makes an abhaya mudra gesture ; the female left half holds a mirror and has a rounded breast . This is the earliest representation of Ardhanarishvara , universally recognized . An early Kushan Ardhanarishvara head discovered at Rajghat is displayed at the Mathura Museum . The right male half has matted hair with a skull and crescent moon ; the left female half has well @-@ combed hair decorated with flowers and wears a patra @-@ kundala ( earring ) . The face has a common third eye . A terracotta seal discovered in Vaishali has half @-@ man , half @-@ woman features . Early Kushan images show Ardhanarishvara in a simple two @-@ armed form , but later texts and sculptures depict a more complex iconography . 
 Ardhanarishvara is referred to by the Greek author Stobaeus ( c . 500 AD ) while quoting <unk> ( c . 154 – 222 AD ) , who learnt from an Indian embassy 's visit to Syria during the reign of Elagabalus ( Antoninus of Emesa ) ( 218 – 22 AD ) . A terracotta androgynous bust , excavated at Taxila and dated to the Saka @-@ Parthian era , pictures a bearded man with female breasts . 
 Ardhanarishvara is interpreted as an attempt to <unk> the two principal Hindu sects , Shaivism and Shaktism , dedicated to Shiva and the Great Goddess . A similar syncretic image is Harihara , a composite form of Shiva and Vishnu , the Supreme deity of the Vaishnava sect .

 The iconographic 16th century work Shilparatna , the Matsya Purana and Agamic texts like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Karanagama – most of them of South Indian origin – describe the iconography of Ardhanarishvara . The right superior side of the body usually is the male Shiva and the left is the female Parvati ; in rare depictions belonging to the Shaktism school , the feminine holds the dominant right side . The icon usually is prescribed to have four , three or two arms , but rarely is depicted with eight arms . In the case of three arms , the Parvati side has only one arm , suggesting a lesser role in the icon . 
 Male half 
 The male half wears a jata @-@ mukuta ( a headdress formed of piled , matted hair ) on his head , adorned with a crescent moon . Sometimes the jata @-@ mukuta is adorned with serpents and the river goddess Ganga flowing through the hair . The right ear wears a <unk> @-@ kundala , <unk> @-@ kundala ( " serpent @-@ earring " ) or ordinary kundala ( " earring " ) . Sometimes , the male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half @-@ moustache is also seen . A half third eye ( <unk> ) is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons ; a full eye may also be depicted in middle of forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown above or below Parvati 's round dot . A common elliptical halo ( <unk> / <unk> ) may be depicted behind the head ; sometimes the shape of the halo may differ on either side . 
 In the four @-@ armed form , a right hand holds a parashu ( axe ) and another makes an abhaya mudra ( gesture of reassurance ) , or one of the right arms is slightly bent and rests on the head of Shiva 's bull mount , Nandi , while the other is held in the abhaya mudra gesture . Another configuration suggests that a right hand holds a trishula ( trident ) and another makes a varada mudra ( gesture of blessing ) . Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and akshamala ( rosary ) are held in the two right hands . In the two @-@ armed form , the right hand holds a kapala ( skull cup ) or gestures in a varada mudra . He may also hold a skull . In the Badami relief , the four @-@ armed Ardhanarishvara plays a veena ( lute ) , using a left and a right arm , while other male arm holds a parashu and the female one a lotus . 
 The Shiva half has a flat masculine chest , a straight vertical chest , broader shoulder , wider waist and muscular thigh . He wears a yagnopavita ( sacred thread ) across the chest , which is sometimes represented as a naga @-@ yagnopavita ( a snake worn as a yagnopavita ) or a string of pearls or gems . The <unk> may also divide the torso into its male and female halves . He wears ornaments characteristic of Shiva 's iconography , including serpent ornaments . 
 In some North Indian images , the male half may be nude and also be ithyphallic ( <unk> or <unk> : with an erect phallus ) , or with a full or half phallus and one testicle . However , such imagery is never found in South Indian images ; the loins are usually covered in a garment ( sometimes a dhoti ) of silk or cotton , or the skin of a tiger or deer ) , typically down to the knee , and held in place by a <unk> @-@ <unk> , serpent girdle or jewellery . The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal ( padma @-@ pitha ) . The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red @-@ coloured or gold or coral in appearance ; however , these features are rarely depicted . 
 Female half 
 The female half has <unk> @-@ mukuta ( a basket @-@ shaped crown ) on her head or well @-@ combed knotted hair or both . The left ear wears a <unk> @-@ kundala ( a type of earring ) . A tilaka or bindu ( a round red dot ) adorns her forehead , matching Shiva 's third eye . The left eye is painted with black eyeliner . While the male neck is sometimes adorned with a jewelled hooded serpent , the female neck has a blue lotus matching it . 
 In the four @-@ armed form , one of the left arms rests on Nandi 's head , while the other is bent in <unk> pose and holds a <unk> ( blue lotus ) or hangs loosely at her side . In the three @-@ armed representation , the left hand holds a flower , a mirror or a parrot . In the case of two @-@ armed icons , the left hand rests on Nandi 's head , hangs loose or holds either a flower , a mirror or a parrot . The parrot may be also perched on Parvati 's wrist . Her hand ( s ) is / are adorned with ornaments like a <unk> ( anklet ) or <unk> ( bangles ) . 
 Parvati has a well @-@ developed , round bosom and a narrow feminine waist embellished with various <unk> ( religious bracelets ) and other ornaments , made of diamonds and other gems . She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male part of the icon . The torso , hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves . Though the male private parts may be depicted , the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped . She wears a multi @-@ coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist . The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna . The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight , resting on a lotus pedestal . In contrast to the Shiva half , the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle , parrot @-@ green or dark in colour . She may be draped in a sari covering her torso and legs . 
 <unk> and vahana 
 The posture of Ardhanarishvara may be tribhanga – bent in three parts : head ( leaning to the left ) , torso ( to the right ) and right leg or in the <unk> position ( straight ) , sometimes standing on a lotus pedestal , whereupon it is called <unk> . Seated images of Ardhanarishvara are missing in iconographic treatises , but are still found in sculpture and painting . Though the canons often depict the Nandi bull as the common vahana ( mount ) of Ardhanarishvara , some depictions have Shiva 's bull vahana seated or standing near or behind his foot , while the goddess 's lion vahana is near her foot . 
 Eight @-@ armed form 
 The <unk> Temple at Bhubaneswar has a dancing eight @-@ armed Ardhanarishvara . The upper male arms hold a lute and akshamala ( rosary ) , while the upper female ones hold a mirror and a book ; the others are broken . Another non @-@ conventional Ardhanarishvara is found at Darasuram . The sculpture is three @-@ headed and eight @-@ armed , holding akshamala , khadga ( sword ) , pasha , musala , kapala ( skull cup ) , lotus and other objects . 
 Other textual descriptions 
 The <unk> Purana mentions that Ardhanarishvara is half @-@ black and half @-@ yellow , nude on one side and clothed on other , wearing skulls and a garland of lotuses on the male half and female half respectively . The Linga Purana gives a brief description of Ardhanarishvara as making varada and abhaya mudras and holding a trishula and a lotus . The Vishnudharmottara Purana prescribes a four @-@ armed form , with right hands holding a rosary and trishula , while the left ones bear a mirror and a lotus . The form is called <unk> in this text .

 The mythology of Ardhanarishvara – which mainly originates in the Puranic canons – was developed later to explain existent images of the deity that had emerged in the Kushan era . 
 The unnamed half @-@ female form of Shiva is also alluded to in the epic Mahabharata . In Book XIII , <unk> praises Shiva rhetorically asking if there is anyone else whose half @-@ body is shared by his spouse , and adds that the universe had risen from the union of sexes , as represented by Shiva 's half @-@ female form . In some narratives , Shiva is described as dark and fair @-@ complexioned , half yellow and half white , half woman and half man , and both woman and man . In Book XIII , Shiva preaches to Parvati that half of his body is made up of her body . 
 In the Skanda Purana , Parvati requests Shiva to allow her to reside with him , embracing " limb @-@ to @-@ limb " , and so Ardhanarishvara is formed . It also tells that when the demon Andhaka wanted to seize Parvati and make her his wife , Vishnu rescued her and brought her to his abode . When the demon followed her there , Parvati revealed her Ardhanarishvara form to him . Seeing the half @-@ male , half @-@ female form , the demon lost interest in her and left . Vishnu was amazed to see this form and saw himself in the female part of the form . 
 The Shiva Purana describes that the creator god Brahma created all male beings , the Prajapatis , and told them to regenerate , which they were unable to do . Confronted with the resulting decline in the pace of creation , Brahma was perplexed and contemplated on Shiva for help . To enlighten Brahma of his folly , Shiva appeared before him as Ardhanarishvara . Brahma prayed to the female half of Shiva to give him a female to continue creation . The goddess agreed and created various female powers from her body , thereby allowing creation to progress . In other Puranas like the Linga Purana , Vayu Purana , Vishnu Purana , Skanda Purana , Kurma Purana , and Markandeya Purana , Rudra ( identified with Shiva ) appears as Ardhanarishvara , emerging from Brahma 's head , forehead , mouth or soul as the embodiment of Brahma 's fury and frustration due to the slow pace of creation . Brahma asks Rudra to divide himself , and the latter complies by dividing into male and female . Numerous beings , including the 11 Rudras and various female shaktis , are created from both the halves . In some versions , the goddess unites with Shiva again and promises to be born as Sati on earth to be Shiva 's wife . In the Linga Purana , the Ardhanarishvara Rudra is so hot that in the process of appearing from Brahma 's forehead , he burns Brahma himself . Ardhanarishvara Shiva then enjoys his own half – the Great Goddess – by " the path of yoga " and creates Brahma and Vishnu from her body . In the repetitive cycle of aeons , Ardhanarishvara is ordained to reappear at the beginning of every creation as in the past . 
 The Matsya Purana describes how Brahma , pleased with a penance performed by Parvati , rewards her by blessing her with a golden complexion . This renders her more attractive to Shiva , to whom she later merges as one half of his body . 
 Tamil temple lore narrates that once the gods and sages ( rishi ) had gathered at Shiva 's abode , they prayed their respects to Shiva and Parvati . However , the sage Bhringi had vowed to worship only one deity , Shiva , and ignored Parvati while worshipping and circumambulating him . Agitated , Parvati cursed Bhringi to lose all his flesh and blood , reducing him to a skeleton . In this form Bhringi could not stand erect , so the compassionate ones who witnessed the scene blessed the sage with a third leg for support . As her attempt to humiliate the sage had failed , Parvati punished herself with austerities that pleased Shiva and led him to grant her the boon of uniting with him , thereby compelling Bhringi to worship her as well as himself in the form of Ardhanarishvara . However , the sage assumed the form of a beetle and circumambulating only the male half , drilling a hole in the deity . Amazed by his devotion , Parvati reconciled with the sage and blessed him . The seventh @-@ century Shaiva Nayanar saint Appar mentions that after marrying Parvati , Shiva incorporated her into half of his body . 
 In the Kalika Purana , Parvati ( called Gauri here ) is described as having suspected Shiva of infidelity when she saw her own reflection in the crystal @-@ like breast of Shiva . A conjugal dispute erupted but was quickly resolved , after which Parvati wished to stay eternally with Shiva in his body . The divine couple was thereafter fused as Ardhanarishvara . Another tale from North India also talks about Parvati 's jealousy . Another woman , the river Ganga – often depicted flowing out of Shiva 's locks – sat on his head , while Parvati ( as Gauri ) sat on his lap . To pacify Gauri , Shiva united with her as Ardhanarishvara . 
 Only in tales associated with the cult of Shakta ( in which the Goddess is considered the Supreme Being ) is the Goddess venerated as the Maker of All . In these tales , it is her body ( not Shiva 's ) which splits into male and female halves .
