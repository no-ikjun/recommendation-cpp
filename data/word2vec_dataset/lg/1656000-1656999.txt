 Word that Lakes had notified Cope of his finds galvanized Marsh into action . When Marsh heard from Union Pacific Railroad workers W.E. Carlin and W.H. Reed about a vast boneyard northwest of Laramie in Como Bluff , Marsh sent his agent , Samuel Wendell Williston , to take charge of the digging . Cope , in response , learned of Carlin and Reed 's discoveries and sent his own men to find bones in the area . The two scientists attempted to sabotage each other 's progress . Cope was described as a genius and what Marsh lacked in intelligence , he easily made up for in connections — Marsh 's uncle was George Peabody , a rich banker who supported Marsh with money , and a secure position at the Peabody Museum . Marsh lobbied John Wesley Powell to act against Cope and attempted to persuade Hayden to " muzzle " Cope 's publishing . Both men tried to spy on the other 's whereabouts and attempted to offer their collectors more money in the hopes of recruiting them to their own side . Cope was able to recruit David Baldwin in New Mexico and Frank Williston in Wyoming from Marsh . Cope and Marsh were extremely secretive as to the source of their fossils . When Henry Fairfield Osborn , at the time a student at Princeton , visited Cope to ask where to travel to look for fossils in the West , Cope politely refused to answer . 
 When Cope arrived back in the United States after his tour of Europe in 1878 , he had nearly two years of fossil findings from Lucas . Among these dinosaurs was Camarasaurus , one of the most recognizable dinosaur recreations of the time . The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City , San Francisco , and north to Oregon , where he was amazed at the rich flora and the blueness of the Pacific Ocean . In 1879 , the United States Congress consolidated the various government survey teams into the United States Geological Survey with Clarence King as its leader . This was discouraging to Cope because King named Marsh , an old college friend , as the chief paleontologist . The period of Cope 's and Marsh 's paleontological digs in the American West spanned from 1877 to 1892 , by which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 The 1880s proved disastrous for Cope . Marsh 's close association with the Geological Survey gave him the resources to employ 54 staff members over the course of ten years . His teaching position at Yale meant he had guaranteed access to the American Journal of Science for publication . Cope had his interest in the Naturalist , but it drained him of funds . After Hayden was removed from the survey , Cope lost his source of government funding . His fortune was not enough to support his rivalry , so Cope invested in mining . Most of his properties were silver mines in New Mexico ; one mine yielded an ore vein worth $ 3 million in silver chloride . Cope visited the mines each summer from 1881 to 1885 , taking the opportunity to supervise or collect other minerals . For a while he made good money , but the mines stopped producing and by 1886 he had to give up his now @-@ worthless stocks . The same year he received a teaching position at the University of Pennsylvania . He continued to travel west , but realized he would not be able to best Marsh in cornering the market for bones ; he had to release the collectors he had hired and sell his collections . During this period , he published 40 to 75 papers each year . With the failure of his mines , Cope began searching for a job , but was turned down at the Smithsonian and American Museum of Natural History . He turned to giving lectures for hire and writing magazine articles . Each year , he lobbied Congress for an appropriation with which to finish his work on " Cope 's Bible " , a volume on Tertiary vertebrates , but was continually turned down . Rather than work with Powell and the survey , Cope tried to inflame sentiment against them . 
 At Marsh 's urging , Powell pushed for Cope to return specimens he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys . This was an outrage to Cope , who had used his own money while working as a volunteer . In response , Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline . Since 1885 , Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years . From scientific errors to publishing mistakes , he had them written down in a journal he kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk . Cope sought out Marsh 's assistants , who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid . Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12 , 1890 , in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh , Powell , and Cope . Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement , and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government @-@ allocated funds . Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and , in the end , little changed . No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell 's alleged misallocation of funds , while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes . Indirectly , however , the attacks may have been influential in Marsh 's fall from power in the survey . Due to pressure from Powell over bad press , Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys . Cope 's relations with the president of the University of Pennsylvania soured , and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled . 
 Cope took his sinking fortunes in stride . In writing to Osborn about the articles , he laughed at the outcome , saying , " It will now rest largely with you whether or not I am supposed to be a liar and am actuated by jealousy and disappointment . I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius <unk> . " Cope was well aware of his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of " Cope " and " hater " , <unk> <unk> . Through his years of financial hardship , he was able to continue publishing papers — his most productive years were 1884 and 1885 , with 79 and 62 papers published , respectively . The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best @-@ known fossil taxa described by Cope : the <unk> Edaphosaurus in 1882 and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889 . In 1889 , he succeeded Leidy , who had died the previous year , as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania . The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope 's family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier . 
 In 1892 , Cope ( then 52 years old ) was granted expense money for field work from the Texas Geological Survey . With his finances improved , he was able to publish a massive work on the <unk> of North America , which was the most detailed analysis and organization of the continent 's frogs and amphibians ever mastered , and the 1 @,@ 115 @-@ page The Crocodilians Lizards and Snakes of North America . In the 1890s , his publication rate increased to an average of 43 articles a year . His final expedition to the West took place in 1894 , when he prospected for dinosaurs in South Dakota and visited sites in Texas and Oklahoma . The same year , Julia was married to William H. Collins , a Haverford astronomy professor . The couple 's ages — Julia was 28 and the groom 35 — were past the conventions of Victorian marriage . After their European honeymoon , the couple returned to Haverford . While Annie moved to Haverford , as well , Cope did not . His official reason was the long commute and late lectures he gave in Philadelphia . In private correspondence , however , Osborn wrote that the two had essentially separated , though they remained on amiable terms . 
 Cope sold his collections to the American Museum of Natural History in 1895 ; his set of 10 @,@ 000 American fossil mammals sold for $ 32 @,@ 000 , lower than Cope 's asking price of $ 50 @,@ 000 . The purchase was financed by the donations from New York 's high society . Cope sold three other collections for $ 29 @,@ 000 . While his collection contained more than 13 @,@ 000 specimens , Cope 's fossil hoard was still much smaller than Marsh 's collection , valued at over a million dollars . The University of Pennsylvania bought part of Cope 's ethnological artifact collection for $ 5 @,@ 500 . The Academy of Natural Sciences , Philadelphia 's foremost museum , did not bid on any of Cope 's sales due to bad blood between Cope and the museum 's leaders ; as a result , many of Cope 's major finds left the city . Cope 's proceeds from the sales allowed him to rehire Sternberg to prospect for fossils on his behalf . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 In 1896 , Cope began suffering from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis . His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able ; at other times , Cope 's university secretary , Anna Brown , tended to him . Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds . Cope often prescribed himself medications , including large amounts of morphine , belladonna , and formalin , a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens . Osborn was horrified by Cope 's actions and made arrangements for surgery , but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope 's health . Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils , became ill again , and returned to his home very weak . Osborn visited Cope on April 5 , inquiring about Cope 's health , but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals . Word of Cope 's illness spread , and he was visited by friends and colleagues ; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed . Cope died on April 12 , 1897 , 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday . 
 Sternberg , still prospecting for Cope that spring , was woken by a liveryman who relayed word from Annie that Cope had died three days earlier . Sternberg wrote in his memoirs , " I had lost friends before , and I had known what it was to bury my own dead , even my firstborn son , but I had never <unk> more deeply than I did over the news . " Cope 's Quaker funeral consisted of six men : Osborn , his colleague William Berryman Scott , Cope 's friend <unk> Frazer , son @-@ in @-@ law Collins , Horatio Wood , and Harrison Allen . The six sat around Cope 's coffin among the fossils and Cope 's pets , a tortoise and a Gila monster , for what Osborn called " a perfect Quaker silence ... an interminable length of time . " Anticipating the quiet , Osborn had brought along a Bible and read an excerpt from the Book of Job , ending by saying , " These are the problems to which our friend devoted his life . " 
 The coffin was loaded on a hearse and carried to a gathering at Fairfield ; much of the gathering was spent in silence . After the coffin was removed , the assembled began talking . Frazer recalled that each person remembered Cope differently , and " Few men succeeded so well in concealing from anyone ... all the sides of his multiform character . " Osborn , intending to follow the coffin to the graveyard , was instead pulled aside by Collins and taken to the reading of Cope 's will — Osborn and Cope 's brother @-@ in @-@ law John Garrett were named executors . Cope gave his family a choice of his books , with the remainder to be sold or donated to the University of Pennsylvania . After debts were handled , Cope left small bequests to friends and family — Anna Brown and Julia received $ 5000 each , while the remainder went to Annie . Cope 's estate was valued at $ 75 @,@ 327 , not including additional revenue raised by sales of fossils to the American Museum of Natural History , for a total of $ 84 @,@ 600 . Some specimens preserved in alcohol made their way to the Academy of Natural Sciences , including a few Gordian worms . 
 Cope insisted through his will that no graveside service or burial be held ; he had donated his body to science . He issued a final challenge to Marsh at his death : he had his skull donated to science so his brain could be measured , hoping his brain would be larger than that of his adversary ; at the time , brain size was thought to be the true measure of intelligence . Marsh never accepted the challenge , and Cope 's skull is reportedly still preserved at the University of Pennsylvania . His ashes were placed at the institute with those of Leidy , while his bones were extracted and kept in a locked drawer to be studied by anatomy students . 
 Osborn listed Cope 's cause of death as uremic poisoning , combined with a large prostate , but the true cause of death is unknown . Many believed Cope had died of syphilis contracted from the women with whom he fraternized during his travels . In 1995 , Davidson gained permission to have the skeleton examined by a medical doctor at the university . Dr. Morrie <unk> , a professor of radiology , concluded no evidence of bony syphilis was found on Cope 's skeleton . 
 Public mentions of Cope 's passing were relatively slight . The Naturalist ran four photographs , a six @-@ page obituary by editor J. S. Kingsley , and a two @-@ page remembrance by Frazer . The National Academy of Sciences ' official memoir was submitted years later and written by Osborn . The American Journal of Science devoted six paragraphs to Cope 's passing , and incorrectly gave his age as 46 . Cope was survived by his rival Marsh , who was suffering poor health . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 As a young man , Cope read Charles Darwin 's Voyage of a Naturalist , which had little effect on him . The only comment about Darwin 's book recorded by Cope was that Darwin discussed " too much geology " from the account of his voyage . Due to his background in taxonomy and paleontology , Cope focused on evolution in terms of changing structure , rather than emphasizing geography and variation within populations as Darwin had . Over his lifetime , Cope 's views on evolution shifted . 
 His original view , described in the paper " On the Origin of Genera " ( 1868 ) , held that while Darwin 's natural selection may affect the preservation of superficial characteristics in organisms , natural selection alone could not explain the formation of genera . Cope 's suggested mechanism for this action was a " steady progressive development of organization " through what Cope termed " a continual crowding backward of the successive steps of individual development " . In Cope 's view , during embryological development , an organism could complete its growth with a new stage of development beyond its parents , taking it to a higher level of organization . Later individuals would inherit this new level of development — thus evolution was a continuous advance of organization , sometimes slowly and other times suddenly ; this view is known as the law of acceleration . 
 Cope 's beliefs later evolved to one with an increased emphasis on continual and utilitarian evolution with less involvement of a Creator . He became one of the founders of the Neo @-@ Lamarckism school of thought , which holds that an individual can pass on traits acquired in its lifetime to offspring . Although the view has been shown incorrect , it was the prevalent theory among paleontologists in Cope 's time . In 1887 , Cope published his own " Origin of the Fittest : Essays in Evolution " , detailing his views on the subject . He was a strong believer in the law of use and disuse — that an individual will slowly , over time , favor an anatomical part of its body so much that it will become stronger and larger as time progresses down the generations . The giraffe , for example , stretched its neck to reach taller trees and passed this acquired characteristic to its offspring in a developmental phase that is added to gestation in the womb . 
 Cope 's Theology of Evolution ( 1887 ) argued that consciousness comes from the mind of the universe and governs evolution by directing animals to new goals . According to <unk> ( 2003 ) , " [ Cope ] argued that organisms respond to changes in their environments by an exercise of choice . Consciousness itself , he maintained , was the principal force in evolution . Cope credited God with having built into evolution a life force that propelled organisms toward even higher levels of consciousness . " 
 = = Personality and legacy = = 
 Julia assisted Osborn in writing a biography of her father , titled Cope : Master Naturalist . She would not comment on the name of the woman with whom her father had had an affair prior to his first European travel . Julia is believed to have burned any of the scandalous letters and journals Cope had kept , but many of his friends were able to give their recollections of the scandalous nature of some of Cope 's unpublished routines . Charles R. Knight , a former friend called , " Cope 's mouth the filthiest , from hearsay that in [ Cope 's ] heyday no woman was safe within five miles of him . " As Julia was the major financier behind The Master Naturalist , she wanted to keep her father 's name in good standing and refused to comment on any misdeeds her father may have committed . 
 Cope was described by zoologist Henry Weed Fowler as " a man of medium height and build , but always impressive with his great energy and activity " . To him , Fowler wrote , " [ Cope ] was both genial and always interesting , easily approachable , and both kindly and helpful . " Cope 's affability during visits to the Academy of Natural Sciences to compare specimens was later recalled by his colleague Witmer Stone : " I have often seen him busily engaged in such comparisons , all the while whistling whole passages from grand opera , or else counting the scales on the back of a lizard , while he conversed in a most amusing manner with some small street urchin who had drifted into the museum and was watching in awe with eyes and mouth wide open . " His self @-@ taught nature , however , meant that he was largely hostile to bureaucracy and politics . He had a famous temper ; one friend called Cope a " militant paleontologist " . Despite his faults , he was generally well liked by his contemporaries . American paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote that , " [ Cope 's ] little slips from virtue were those we might make ourselves , were we bolder " . 
 Cope was raised as a Quaker , and was taught that the Bible was literal truth . Although he never confronted his family about their religious views , Osborn writes that Cope was at least aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion . Osborn writes : " If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the <unk> of the Bible ... he did not express them in his letters to his family but there can be little question ... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period . " Lanham writes that Cope 's religious fervor ( which seems to have subsided after his father 's death ) was embarrassing to even his devout Quaker associates . Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope 's internal religious conflicts . She ascribes Cope 's deference to his father 's beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain his father 's financial support . Frazer 's reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told people what they wanted to hear , rather than his true views . 
 Cope 's views on human races would today be considered racist , but his beliefs were used by scientists of the time as an excuse for imperialism . He believed that if , " a race was not white then it was inherently more ape @-@ like " . He was not opposed to blacks because of the color of their skin but their " degrading vices " , believing that the " inferior Negro should go back to Africa . " He did not blame blacks for their perceived " poor virtue " , but wrote , " A vulture will always eat carrion when surrounded on all hands by every kind of cleaner food . It is the nature of the bird . " Cope was against the modern view of women 's rights , believing in the husband 's role as protector ; he was opposed to women 's suffrage , as he felt they would be unduly influenced by their husbands . 
 In fewer than 40 years as a scientist , Cope published over 1 @,@ 400 scientific papers , a record that stands to this day . These include three major volumes : On the Origin of Genera ( 1867 ) , The Vertebrata of the Tertiary Formations of the West ( 1884 ) and " Essays in Evolution " . He discovered a total of 56 new dinosaur species during the Bone Wars compared to Marsh 's 80 . Although Cope is today known as a herpetologist and paleontologist , his contributions extended to ichthyology , in which he catalogued 300 species of fishes over three decades . In total , he discovered and described over 1 @,@ 000 species of fossil vertebrates and published 600 separate titles . 
 The salamander Dicamptodon copei ( Nussbaum , 1970 ) , the dinosaur Drinker nisti ( Bakker et al . , 1990 ) , the lizard <unk> <unk> <unk> ( H. C. Yarrow , Cope 's gray treefrog Hyla <unk> , and the splash tetra <unk> <unk> ( Regan , 1912 ) are among the many species named for Cope . Currently , 21 fish species named copei are distributed among 11 families . <unk> is the journal of the American Society of <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) , founded in 1913 by John Treadwell Nichols .

 Martin Pierre Brodeur ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> ̃ <unk> ] ; born May 6 , 1972 ) is a Canadian former ice hockey goaltender and the assistant general manager of the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . In his 21 @-@ season tenure with the New Jersey Devils , he won three Stanley Cup championships and five Eastern Conference titles in 17 postseason campaigns . He also won two Olympic gold medals with Team Canada in the 2002 and 2010 Winter Olympic Games , as well as several other medals with Team Canada in other international competitions . Brodeur is widely regarded as one of the greatest goaltenders of all time . 
 Brodeur holds numerous NHL and franchise records , including all @-@ time regular season wins ( 691 ) , losses ( 397 ) , shutouts ( 125 ) , and games played ( 1 @,@ 266 ) . He won at least 30 games in twelve straight seasons between 1995 – 96 and 2007 – 08 and is the only goalie in NHL history with eight 40 @-@ win seasons . He is a four @-@ time Vezina Trophy winner , a five @-@ time Jennings Trophy winner , a ten @-@ time NHL All @-@ Star , a Calder Memorial Trophy winner , and one of only two NHL goaltenders to score a goal in both the regular season and the playoffs . 
 Brodeur used a hybrid style of goaltending by standing up more than butterfly style goalies , though he adapted to more modern techniques at the latter stage of his career . He was known for his puck handling , his positional play , and his reflexes , especially with his glove hand . Brodeur 's prowess at puck handling was so notorious that it led in part to the NHL changing its rules regarding where goalies were allowed to handle the puck outside of the goal crease , leading to its moniker of " The Brodeur Rule " . He announced his retirement in the middle of the 2014 – 15 season after a brief stint with the Blues , having played in seven games with the team . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Brodeur 's success followed his father Denis , who played in the 1956 Olympics for Team Canada and won a bronze medal . After his playing career , Denis was a longtime photographer for the Montreal Canadiens . For more than 20 years , he attended all Montreal games and practices , and when Brodeur was old enough , he came along . Brodeur idolized their goaltender Patrick Roy . 
 Brodeur started playing hockey as a forward . His goaltending career began when his coach asked him if he wanted to play as a backup at the position in a youth tournament . Brodeur explained : 
 The next season my coach came up to me and said , ' Do you want to be a goalie or forward this year ? ' It was the biggest decision of my life , and I was seven years old . I don 't know why I decided , but I thought it would be fun to play goal . 
 Brodeur 's play in goal was soon noticed by fans and scouts . In 1990 , he made it to the Quebec Major Junior League . While playing with the Saint @-@ Hyacinthe Laser , Brodeur made the QMJHL All @-@ Rookie team and the QMJHL 2nd All @-@ Star Team in 1992 . 
 Brodeur was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the first round ( 20th overall ) in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft .

 In the 1991 – 92 NHL season , Brodeur spent most of his time with the Utica Devils of the AHL , but was called up to the NHL on an emergency basis for four games when New Jersey 's goaltenders Chris Terreri and Craig Billington became injured . Brodeur won his NHL debut against the Boston Bruins , 4 – 2 , and played in one playoff game that season . Brodeur spent the following season in the AHL with Utica . However , in the 1993 – 94 season , Brodeur returned to the NHL permanently and gained recognition when he won the Calder Trophy , an annual award for the best rookie in the NHL . He led the Devils to the second @-@ best record in the league and the Eastern Conference Finals in the playoffs , where they lost to the New York Rangers in seven games . He finished 2nd in goals against average ( GAA ) ( 2 @.@ 40 ) and 4th in save percentage ( <unk> ) in 47 games played during the regular season , helping him eventually land the starting job over Terreri . 
 In the 1994 – 95 NHL season , which was shortened to 48 games due to a four @-@ month lockout , the Devils finished tied for 9th overall , 5th in their conference , and they were not considered a Stanley Cup contender . With the leadership of Brodeur , they defeated the Boston Bruins in the 1st round , shutting them out in three of their four wins . In the second round against Pittsburgh , Brodeur gave up only eight goals and helped the Devils defeat the Penguins in five games . In the third round , the Devils defeated Philadelphia in six games , giving them their first Stanley Cup Final appearance in franchise history , against the heavily favoured Detroit Red Wings . The strong play of Brodeur and the Devils ' infamous " trap " method made the series lopsided in favour of New Jersey , who swept the Red Wings 4 games to 0 while holding them to only seven goals in four games . Brodeur won a Stanley Cup in only his second full season in the NHL . After the victory , he was quoted as saying : 
 In the last game against Detroit , the time from ten minutes left to one minute left was probably the longest nine minutes of my life . But from one to zero was probably the greatest time I 've ever had . I didn 't want the clock to run out . It was such a great feeling : people crying in the stands , people jumping up and down , people cheering . Guys couldn 't even sit up on the bench . It was probably the best minute of my life . 
 = = = = 1995 – 99 = = = = 
 After a year of success , the Devils were in the middle of the pack for most of the 1995 – 96 season and barely missed the playoffs . Brodeur played in 74 of his team 's 82 games , setting a single @-@ season record for most minutes played by a goalie , while having the 2nd @-@ most shutouts ( 6 ) in the league . He was named the starter in the All @-@ Star Game for the Eastern Conference and stopped all 12 shots he faced . He finished fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy , which is awarded to the league 's top goaltender . Brodeur also played on Team Canada during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey , where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal finals . 
 In the 1996 – 97 season , the Devils finished 3rd in the NHL . Brodeur was runner @-@ up for the Vezina Trophy , was named to the All @-@ Star team , and had the lowest goals against average by a goalie in almost 30 years , earning him the Jennings Trophy . He also had 10 shutouts and a .927 save percentage . On April 17 , 1997 , in the first game of a first @-@ round playoff matchup against the Montreal Canadiens , Brodeur fired the puck the length of the ice and into the Canadiens ' empty net to ensure a 5 – 2 victory . It was only the second time in NHL history that a goaltender had scored in the playoffs , and the fifth time overall . The Devils went on to win that series , but lost in the second round to the rival New York Rangers . 
 The following year , Brodeur had 43 wins and 10 shutouts in the regular season . The Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference , but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eighth @-@ seeded Ottawa Senators . Once again , Brodeur made the All @-@ Star Team , finished as a runner @-@ up for the Vezina Trophy , and won the Jennings Trophy . 
 In the 1998 – 99 season , the Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference for the third straight year , with Brodeur winning 39 games . He was among the contenders for the Vezina Trophy and started in the All @-@ Star game , making his fourth appearance . However , the Devils lost in the first round to the Penguins . It was the worst playoff performance in Brodeur 's five @-@ year career , as he allowed 20 goals in seven games with an <unk> save percentage . 
 = = = = 1999 – 2004 = = = = 
 During the 1999 – 2000 season , on February 15 , 2000 , Brodeur was credited with his second career goal , as Brodeur was the last Devils player on the ice to touch the puck before Daymond Langkow of the Philadelphia Flyers accidentally put the puck into his own empty net during a delayed penalty call against the Devils . Brodeur had previously tapped the puck behind his net , stopping an attempted wrap @-@ around by a Philadelphia Flyer . 
 That season , Brodeur won 43 games for the second time in his career , and the Devils finished with the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference after losing the division to the Philadelphia Flyers by two points . Brodeur helped the Devils sweep the Florida Panthers in the first round , giving up only six goals in four games . In the next round against the Toronto Maple Leafs he recorded two shutouts , including one in the final game of the series as the Devils went on to win four games to two , setting up a showdown with rival Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference Finals . The Flyers took a commanding 3 – 1 series lead and had home ice to close out the series , but Brodeur gave up only one goal in each of the remaining three games of the series , propelling the Devils to the surprising come from behind series victory in 7 games . They went on to play the Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup Final , who had a higher seed but fewer regular season points , giving the Devils home ice advantage in the series . After taking game one with a 7 @-@ goal rally against Dallas , the Devils were led by Brodeur the rest of the way as he gave up only six goals in the next five games , giving the team their second Stanley Cup Championship in six years . 
 The next year , Brodeur topped the 40 @-@ win mark for the third time in his career , despite having an average GAA and save @-@ percentage throughout the season . He played in the All @-@ Star Game for the 6th consecutive season , and helped the Devils earn the top seed in the Eastern Conference . In the first round Brodeur recorded two shutouts against the Carolina Hurricanes and the Devils took the series in six games . After struggling to beat 7th @-@ seeded Toronto in seven games , the Devils had little trouble defeating the 6th @-@ seeded Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals , where Brodeur added two more shutouts , both on the road . In their second straight Stanley Cup finals appearance , the Devils played a back @-@ and @-@ forth series against the top seeded Colorado Avalanche , and lost in seven games . 
 In the 2001 – 02 season , Brodeur finished among the league leaders in wins and GAA . Brodeur continued to lead the league in victories and remained a Vezina and MVP candidate . The next season , in 2002 – 03 , Brodeur finally achieved what had been eluding him his whole career : the Vezina Trophy . He also won the Jennings Trophy again , was a Hart Memorial Trophy finalist for the league 's Most Valuable Player , and was named a 1st Team All @-@ Star and started in the All @-@ Star Game . With one of the most impressive playoff performances of his career , Brodeur guided the Devils to their third Stanley Cup victory after dramatic seven @-@ game series wins against the top @-@ seeded Ottawa Senators and the surprising 7th @-@ seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim . He posted 3 shutouts against Anaheim and had a playoff total of 7 overall , breaking Dominik Hašek 's NHL record of 6 ( Hašek had recorded his 6 shutouts for Detroit the previous year ) . Despite this , the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP was awarded to Anaheim goaltender Jean @-@ Sébastien Giguère , who became the first player not on the championship team to be named playoff MVP since Ron Hextall of Philadelphia in 1987 . Some hockey writers speculated a New Jersey player did not win because there were multiple candidates , resulting in a split vote among the sportswriters who selected the winner . In the 2003 – 04 season , Brodeur won his second consecutive Vezina Trophy and Jennings trophy . He was also a first Team All @-@ Star , a starter in the NHL All @-@ Star Game , and a finalist for the Hart Trophy again . The Devils lost the Atlantic Division title by 1 point to the Philadelphia Flyers , who thus obtained the third seed and home ice advantage against the sixth @-@ seeded Devils in the first round of the playoffs . This would be too much for Brodeur and the Devils to overcome , as the Flyers went on to defeat them in five games . 
 = = = = The Brodeur Rule = = = = 
 After the 2004 – 05 lockout and before the start of the 2005 – 06 season , the league instituted a new rule preventing goaltenders from playing the puck behind the goal line , except within a trapezoid @-@ shaped zone located behind the net . The trapezoid begins at the goal line with angled lines six feet from each goal post and widens to 28 feet at the end boards . Former Flyers general manager Bobby Clarke was one of the leaders in getting the trapezoid implemented . This was viewed by many as singling out Brodeur , who was one of the best at getting behind the net to handle the puck , and has come to be known as the " Brodeur Rule " . 
 At the 2009 NHL General Managers ' Meeting , it was discussed whether the rule should be eliminated as a solution to the increasing number of injuries on defenseman who are being hit hard by forechecking forwards . The <unk> were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds . Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games . He explained , " If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck , they 'll mess up more than they 're successful . " He also expressed his concern for defencemen , " It 's a no @-@ brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen ... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit , I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that . Now , I 've got to sit and watch all the time ... You 've got to try to find something because so many guys are getting hurt . " At the time of his statement , Devils defencemen Paul Martin , Johnny <unk> and Bryce Salvador were all out with injuries . 
 Ultimately the suggestion was rejected and the rule stayed in place . Toronto Maple Leafs former GM Brian Burke said , " We had originally approved a rule where the goaltenders couldn 't handle the puck behind the net at all . The game was turning into a tennis match . You 'd dump it in and the goalie would throw it out and now with the soft chip into the corner it turns into a puck battle and a forecheck opportunity , which is what we wanted . "

 After the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout canceled the 2004 – 05 season , Brodeur signed a contract extension with the Devils on January 27 , 2006 , that would pay him $ 31 @.@ 2 million over six years . In the 2005 – 06 season he posted 43 wins , adding onto his NHL records of what was now five 40 @-@ win seasons and ten consecutive 30 @-@ win seasons . After struggling early in the season , his impressive play later on made him a finalist for the Vezina Trophy for the third straight year , and helped lead the Devils to a surprising comeback in the last two months of the season that resulted in them winning the Atlantic Division in the final game of the year . In the first round of the playoffs , he beat the Rangers for the first time in his career , leading the Devils to a four @-@ game sweep . But a 4 – 1 series loss to the Carolina Hurricanes eliminated the Devils in the next round . 
 In the 2006 – 07 season , Brodeur made his ninth NHL All @-@ Star Game appearance in Dallas , Texas , won his third Vezina Trophy and rose on several NHL records lists . On December 8 , 2006 , he posted a 2 – 0 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers for his <unk> career win , moving him into 2nd place on the all @-@ time list ahead of Ed Belfour . Just a few weeks later , on December 26 , Brodeur beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 3 – 0 to record his 85th career shutout , moving him past Glenn Hall for 3rd place on that all @-@ time list and 1st place among all active goalies . On February 1 , 2007 , Brodeur beat the Philadelphia Flyers 6 – 5 in overtime to take the all @-@ time lead in overtime ( non @-@ shootout ) wins with 45 , passing Roy . The Devils first 38 wins of the season were all with Brodeur in net , leading him to set a NHL record for most consecutive wins for a team . 
 On April 3 , 2007 , Brodeur tied the NHL record for most wins in a single season with 47 , set by Bernie Parent in 1973 – 74 , in a 2 – 1 shootout victory against the Ottawa Senators . Two days later , he broke the record with his 48th win in a 3 – 2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers , which helped the Devils clinch their seventh Atlantic Division title and the second seed in the Eastern Conference . 
 In the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals against the seventh @-@ seeded Tampa Bay Lightning , Brodeur started out shaky and the Devils fell behind two @-@ games @-@ to @-@ one . He rebounded , however , to finish the series , and helped the team advance in six games , while passing Grant Fuhr for second place in all @-@ time playoff victories . In the second round against the Ottawa Senators , Brodeur could not continue his stellar play and allowed 15 goals in only five games en route to a 4 – 1 series defeat to the Senators . 
 In the 2007 – 08 season , Brodeur became the second goalie in NHL history to reach 500 wins with a victory against the Philadelphia Flyers on November 17 , 2007 . The only other goalie to achieve the feat is Patrick Roy . Brodeur was also named the starting goalie for the Eastern Conference in the 2007 – 08 NHL All Star Game in Atlanta . However , he was unable to participate because of a family obligation . New York Islanders goalie Rick DiPietro took over as starter of the game , while Boston Bruins goalie Tim Thomas took the last spot for goalies . 
 After losing a bitter series against the rival New York Rangers in the opening round of the 2008 NHL playoffs , Brodeur refused to shake Sean Avery 's hand . During game three of the series , in an unusual move , Avery turned to face Brodeur during a 5 @-@ on @-@ 3 power play , and began waving his hands and stick in front of Brodeur 's face in an effort to distract him . The day after this game the NHL announced that it had revised its unsportsmanlike conduct rule , now known as The Sean Avery Rule , effectively outlawing such antics . 
 Brodeur started wearing a new painted mask design for the 2008 – 09 NHL season with a stylized " <unk> " on the front , replacing the " J " that had been on his mask for his entire NHL career . During a game on November 1 , 2008 , Brodeur suffered a " bruised elbow " which would later be diagnosed as a torn distal biceps tendon , the first major injury in his career . Following surgery on November 6 , he would miss 16 weeks of the season before playing his next game on February 26 , 2009 . Upon returning from the injury , Brodeur registered a 4 – 0 shutout against the Colorado Avalanche for his 99th career shutout . Three days later , he recorded his 100th career shutout against the Philadelphia Flyers , three short of Terry Sawchuk 's NHL record . 
 = = = = 2009 – 14 = = = = 
 Beginning in 2009 , Brodeur broke a number of career records for goaltenders , including :

 In the 2009 – 10 NHL season , Brodeur led the NHL in wins ( 45 ) , shutouts ( 9 ) , games played ( 77 ) and minutes played ( 4 @,@ 499 ) . He also won his fifth Jennings Trophy and had the third @-@ best GAA in the league , leading his team to back @-@ to @-@ back division wins that included a 6 – 0 regular @-@ season sweep of the defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins . However , the Devils lost in the first round of the playoffs , losing to the seventh @-@ seeded team Philadelphia Flyers in five games . Brodeur went on to record 23 wins during the 2010 – 11 NHL season , which saw the Devils slump during the first half of the season , only to miss the playoffs narrowly after a hot winning streak during the season 's latter half . 
 The Devils returned to the playoffs in the 2011 – 12 NHL season , as Brodeur recorded his 14th 30 @-@ win season . In Game 1 of the conference quarterfinals against the Florida Panthers , Brodeur became only the second goaltender to record 100 playoff wins in a 3 – 2 Devils victory . In Game 4 with a 4 – 0 victory , Brodeur broke the NHL career playoff shutout record with his 24th , surpassing Patrick Roy , who had 23 . 
 On May 25 , 2012 , Brodeur and the Devils defeated the New York Rangers 3 – 2 on an overtime goal by Adam Henrique , leading to Brodeur 's fifth Stanley Cup Finals appearance . The Devils lost in the Finals to the Los Angeles Kings in six games . 
 During the off @-@ season of 2012 , Brodeur hired agent Pat Brisson leading many to believe he would test free @-@ agency or retire . However , on July 2 , 2012 , Brodeur agreed to a two @-@ year , $ 9 million deal to remain with the Devils , alongside backup goalie Johan Hedberg . 
 On March 21 , 2013 , in his first game back from a month @-@ long absence due to a pinched nerve injury in his upper back , Brodeur was credited with a power play goal against the Carolina Hurricanes , making him the only NHL goalie to record three career goals , and the second goalie to have scored on the power play ( Evgeni Nabokov was the first ) . On June 28 , 2013 , it was announced that Brodeur would be the cover athlete for EA 's NHL 14 video game . He defeated finalist Sergei <unk> in an online vote . 
 On June 7 , 2014 , Brodeur told ESPN he would test the free agency market for the 2014 – 15 season , ending his 21 @-@ year tenure with the Devils .

 Brodeur was selected as Team Canada 's back @-@ up goalie to Patrick Roy for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan , but did not get to play . Canada failed to win a medal after losing the bronze @-@ medal match to Finland , a game in which many people thought Brodeur should have played . 
 In the 2002 Olympics at Salt Lake City , Utah , Brodeur was initially named the backup behind Curtis Joseph . But following Joseph 's losing the tournament opener against Sweden , Brodeur was named the starting goaltender the rest of the way , and won gold for Canada . He had the best GAA in the tournament and went undefeated , stopping 31 of 33 shots in the gold @-@ medal victory over Team USA . 
 Brodeur then led Team Canada to a World Cup of Hockey championship in 2004 , allowing only 5 goals in five games . He led all goalies in GAA and save percentage while going undefeated . He had another impressive performance for the team at the world hockey championships in the following year . After this , The Sports Forecaster 2005 – 06 said the following : 
 Brodeur is arguably the top goaltender in the world . Fresh off a World Cup win in 2004 and another strong performance at the 2005 IIHF World hockey championships . He 's the game 's best puck @-@ handling goaltender , though the NHL 's new rules changes may somewhat alter that effectiveness . 
 Brodeur was selected as Team Canada 's starter in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin , Italy . He started in 4 of 6 games , but Canada failed to win a medal after losing to Russia in the quarterfinals . 
 He was one of the three goalies on Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , Canada . He registered a shootout win against Switzerland and a loss to the United States . After the loss to the US , he was benched for the remainder of the 2010 Games in favour of Roberto Luongo .

Melanie filed for divorce during the 2003 playoffs amid reports that Brodeur was having an affair with Genevieve Nault , the wife of Melanie 's brother . The incident added some fuel to the fire for hecklers during the playoffs . The reports proved to be true , as he and Genevieve married in June 2008 . Their first child together , Maxime Philippe Brodeur , was born in November 2009 . 
 Brodeur is regarded as an engaging raconteur in his spare time . He has hosted a street hockey tournament in his hometown of St. Leonard , Quebec , for each of the Devils ' Stanley Cup championships , where he plays his childhood position of forward . His oldest brother , Denis Jr . , is a photographer like their father , and his other older brother , Claude , was a pitcher in the Montreal Expos ' farm system . He has two sisters , Line and Sylvie .

 = Falkirk Wheel = 
 The Falkirk Wheel is a rotating boat lift in Scotland , connecting the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal . The lift , named after the nearby town of Falkirk in central Scotland , opened in 2002 . It reconnects the two canals for the first time since the 1930s as part of the Millennium Link project . 
 The plan to regenerate central Scotland 's canals and reconnect Glasgow with Edinburgh was led by British Waterways with support and funding from seven local authorities , the Scottish Enterprise Network , the European Regional Development Fund , and the Millennium Commission . Planners decided early on to create a dramatic 21st @-@ century landmark structure to reconnect the canals , instead of simply recreating the historic lock flight . 
 The wheel raises boats by 24 metres ( 79 ft ) , but the Union Canal is still 11 metres ( 36 ft ) higher than the aqueduct which meets the wheel . Boats must also pass through a pair of locks between the top of the wheel and the Union Canal . The Falkirk Wheel is the only rotating boat lift of its kind in the world , and one of two working boat lifts in the United Kingdom , the other being the Anderton boat lift . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ 1933 link = = = 
 The two canals served by the wheel were previously connected by a series of 11 locks . With a 35 @-@ metre ( 115 ft ) difference in height , it required 3 @,@ 500 tonnes ( 3 @,@ 400 long tons ; 3 @,@ 900 short tons ) of water per run and took most of a day to pass through the flight . 
 By the 1930s these had fallen into disuse , and the locks were dismantled in 1933 . The Forth and Clyde canal closed at the end of 1962 , and by the mid @-@ 1970s the Union canal was filled in at both ends , rendered impassable by culverts in two places and run in pipes under a housing estate . The British Waterways Board ( BWB ) came into existence on 1 January 1963 , the day the Forth and Clyde was closed , with the objective of finding a broad strategy for the future of canals in the United Kingdom . 
 In 1976 , the BWB decided after a meeting with local councils that the Forth and Clyde canal , fragmented by various developments , was to have its remaining navigability preserved by building new bridges with sufficient headroom for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks . Restoration of sea @-@ to @-@ sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time , but there were to be no further restrictions on its use . A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation , and sought the opinions of twenty interested parties to present the Forth and Clyde Local ( Subject ) Plan in 1980 . 
 = = = Proposal = = = 
 The Lotteries Act 1993 resulted in the creation of the Millennium Commission to disseminate funds raised by the sale of lottery tickets for selected " good causes . " In 1996 , when sufficient funds had been accumulated , the Commission invited applications to " do anything they thought desirable ... to support worthwhile causes which would mark the year 2000 and the start of the new millennium . " The conditions were that the Commission would fund no more than half of the project , with the remaining balance being covered by project backers . 
 The BWB had made an earlier plan for the reopening of the canal link , which comprehensively covered the necessary work . In 1994 , the BWB announced its plan to bid for funding , which was submitted in 1995 on behalf of the Millennium Link Partnership . The plans called for the canals to be opened to their original operating dimensions , with 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) of space above the water . The whole project had a budget of £ 78 million . 
 On Valentine 's Day 1997 , the Commission announced it would support the Link with £ 32 million of funding , 42 % of the project cost . The Wheel and its associated basin was priced at £ 17 million , more than a fifth of the total budget . Another £ 46 million had to be raised in the next two years before construction could commence , with contributions from BWB , seven local councils , Scottish Enterprise , and private donations being augmented by £ 8 @.@ 6 million from the European Regional Development Fund . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 The Morrison @-@ <unk> <unk> Joint Venture Team submitted their original design , which resembled a Ferris wheel with four gondolas in 1999 . It was agreed by all parties that the design was functional , but not the showpiece the BWB were looking for . After being asked to reconsider , a 20 @-@ strong team of architects and engineers was assembled by British Waterways . Led by Tony Kettle from architects RMJM the initial concepts and images were created with the mechanical concepts proposed by the design team from Butterley and M G Bennetts . This was an intense period of work with the final design concept completed in a three @-@ week period during the summer of 1999 . The final design was a cooperative effort between the British Waterways Board , engineering consultants Arup , Butterley Engineering and RMJM . 
 Diagrams of gear systems that had been proposed in the very first concepts were modeled by Kettle using his 8 @-@ year @-@ old daughter 's Lego . Drawings and artist impressions were shown to clients and funders . The visitor centre was designed by another RMJM architect , Paul <unk> . 
 Inspirations for the design include a double @-@ headed Celtic axe , the propellor of a ship and the ribcage of a whale . Kettle described the Wheel as " a beautiful , organic flowing thing , like the spine of a fish , " and the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland described it as " a form of contemporary sculpture . " 
 Models and renderings of the Falkirk Wheel were displayed in a 2012 exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London . Since 2007 , the Falkirk Wheel has been featured on the obverse of the new series of £ 50 notes issued by the Bank of Scotland . The series of notes commemorates Scottish engineering achievements with illustrations of bridges in Scotland such as the Glenfinnan Viaduct and the Forth Bridge . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 In March 1999 the Secretary of State for Scotland cut the first sod of turf to begin work at lock 31 on the Forth and Clyde canal . Over 1000 people were employed in the construction of the wheel , which has been designed to last for at least 120 years . 
 The wheel was fully constructed and assembled at the Butterley Engineering plant in Ripley , Derbyshire . The structure was then dismantled in the summer of 2001 , and transported on 35 lorry loads to Falkirk , before being reassembled into five sections on the ground and lifted into place . Construction of the canal required 250 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 8 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of excavation , a 160 @-@ metre ( 520 ft ) canal tunnel of 8 metres ( 26 ft ) diameter , aqueducts of 20 metres ( 66 ft ) and 120 metres ( 390 ft ) , three set of locks and a number of bridges , as well as 600 metres ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) of access roads . The 180 metres ( 590 ft ) Rough Castle Tunnel was driven in three stages , with the two upper quarters being drilled with a standard excavator before the lower half was dug using a modified road <unk> in 100 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) layers . This technique was 15 per cent cheaper and reduced the build time of the tunnel by two weeks . 
 = = = Technical considerations = = = 
 The ground on which the wheel is built was previously used as an open cast fire clay mine , a coal mine , and a tar works , resulting in contamination of the canal with tar and mercury . 20 metres ( 66 ft ) of loosely packed backfill from the mining operations containing large sandstone boulders was not considered adequately solid foundation for the size of the structure , so deep foundations with thirty 22 metres ( 72 ft ) concrete piles socketed onto the bedrock were used . 
 Due to the changing load as the wheel rotates in alternating directions , some sections experience total stress reversals . In order to avoid fatigue that could lead to cracks , sections were bolted rather than welded , using over 14 @,@ 000 bolts and 45 @,@ 000 bolt holes . 
 The aqueduct , engineered by <unk> , was originally described as " <unk> , " but was eventually realised using 40 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) rebar . The original plans also showed the canal being built straight through the Antonine Wall , but this was changed after a petition in favour of two locks and a tunnel under the wall . 
 = = = Opening ceremony = = = 
 On 24 May 2002 , Queen Elizabeth II opened the Falkirk Wheel as part of her Golden Jubilee celebrations . The opening was delayed a month due to flooding caused by vandals who forced open the wheel 's gates . The damage , which cost £ 350 @,@ 000 to repair , resulted in the dry well being flooded , damaging electrical and hydraulic equipment .

 = = = Structure = = = 
 The wheel has an overall diameter of 35 metres ( 115 ft ) and consists of two opposing arms extending 15 metres beyond the central axle and taking the shape of a Celtic @-@ inspired , double @-@ headed axe . Two sets of these axe @-@ shaped arms are connected to a 3 @.@ 8 @-@ metre ( 12 ft ) diameter central axle of length 28 metres ( 92 ft ) . Two diametrically opposed water @-@ filled caissons , each with a capacity of 250 @,@ 000 litres ( 55 @,@ 000 imp gal ; 66 @,@ 000 US gal ) , are fitted between the ends of the arms . 
 The caissons or gondolas always carry a combined weight of 500 tonnes ( 490 long tons ; 550 short tons ) of water and boats , with the gondolas themselves each weighing 50 tonnes ( 49 long tons ; 55 short tons ) . Care is taken to maintain the water levels on each side , thus balancing the weight on each arm . According to Archimedes ' principle , floating objects displace their own weight in water , so when the boat enters , the amount of water leaving the caisson weighs exactly the same as the boat . This is achieved by maintaining the water levels on each side to within ± 37 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) using a site @-@ wide computer control system comprising water level sensors , automated sluices and pumps . It takes 22 @.@ 5 kilowatts ( 30 @.@ 2 hp ) to power ten hydraulic motors , which consume 1 @.@ 5 kilowatt @-@ hours ( 5 @.@ 4 MJ ) per half @-@ turn , roughly the same as boiling eight kettles of water . 
 The two caissons are 6 @.@ 5 metres ( 21 ft ) wide , and can hold up to four 20 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 66 ft ) canal boats . Watertight doors at each end match doors located on the upper structure and lower dock pit . Due to space concerns , where a normal hinged door would dramatically reduce the useful length of the caisson , vertically rising doors were chosen . The doors are raised from a recess in the base of the caisson and powered by a hydraulic lance when docked . 
 = = = Engine room = = = 
 The area housing the machinery to drive the wheel is located in the final pillar of the aqueduct , and contains seven chambers connected by ladders . Access is by a door located at ground level or an entrance halfway up the tower with a gantry crane to facilitate the installation of equipment . 
 The ground floor houses the transformers for powering the wheel . When the wheel was flooded by vandals in April 2002 , this room was filled to within 8 cm ( 3 in ) of the 11 kV <unk> . On the first floor is a standby generator and switchgear should the mains supply to the wheel fail . The second floor houses a pair of hydraulic pumps that drive the hydraulic motors in the chamber above . Power is supplied directly to the axle with 10 hydraulic motors , which also double as brakes . Connected to each motor is a 100 : 1 gear system to reduce the rotation speed . 
 = = = Mechanism = = = 
 The caissons are required to turn with the wheel in order to remain level . Whilst the weight of the caissons on the bearings is generally sufficient to rotate them , a gearing mechanism using three large identically sized gears connected by two smaller ones ensures that they turn at precisely the correct speed and remain correctly balanced . 
 Each end of each caisson is supported on small wheels , which run on rails on the inside face of the eight @-@ metre diameter holes at the ends of the arms . The rotation is controlled by a train of gears : an alternating pattern of three eight @-@ metre diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears , all with external teeth , as shown in the picture . The large central gear is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine @-@ room end and fixed in place prevent it from rotating . The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine @-@ room end . When the motors rotate the central axle , the arms swing and the small gears engage the central gear , which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction . The smaller gears engage the large ring gears at the end of the caissons , driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction . This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level . 
 = = = Docking @-@ pit = = = 
 The docking @-@ pit is a drydock @-@ like port isolated from the lower canal basin by means of watertight gates and kept dry by means of water pumps . When the wheel stops with its arms in the vertical position it is possible for boats to enter and exit the lower caisson when the gates are open without flooding the docking @-@ pit . The space below the caisson is empty . 
 Without the docking @-@ pit , the caissons and extremities of the arms of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotated . The buoyancy of the lower caisson would make it more difficult to turn the wheel . 
 = = = Visitor centre = = = 
 A visitor centre is located on the east side of the lower basin . Boat trips on the wheel depart approximately once an hour . Since the wheel opened , around 4 @.@ 4 million people have visited and 1 @.@ 3 million have taken a boat trip , with around 400 @,@ 000 people visiting the wheel annually . 
 = Nikolai Podgorny = 
 Nikolai Viktorovich Podgorny ( Russian : Никола ́ й <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> ; IPA : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] , Ukrainian : Микола <unk> <unk> ; 18 February [ O.S. 5 February ] 1903 – 11 January 1983 ) was a Soviet statesman during the Cold War . He served as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine from 1957 to 1963 and as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 1965 to 1977 . He was replaced as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977 by General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev . That same year he lost his seat in the Political Bureau ( Politburo ) and was forced to resign from active politics . 
 Podgorny was born in the city of Karlovka in 1903 to a Ukrainian working @-@ class family . He graduated in from a local worker 's school in 1926 , and in 1931 from the Kiev Technological Institute of Food Industry . He became a member of the All @-@ Union Communist Party ( bolsheviks ) in 1930 . Like his friend and ally Andrei Kirilenko , Podgorny climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the industrial ladder ( delivering the production goals set by the bureaucrats in charge of the centrally planned economy ) . By 1953 he had become Second Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine . After Anastas Mikoyan 's resignation , Podgorny was voted into office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet . After Premier Alexei Kosygin 's fall from favour Podgorny became the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union until his removal as head of state in 1977 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Podgorny was born on 18 February [ O.S. 5 February ] 1903 in Karlovka , Russian Empire , to a Ukrainian working @-@ class family . Podgorny started work at the age of 17 as a student at the mechanical workshops in Karlovka . After the Russian Revolution Podgorny became one of the founders of the Karlovka Komsomol . He served as a Secretary of the Komsomol from 1921 to 1923 . In 1926 Podgorny graduated from a local workers ' school , and then from the Kiev Technological Institute of Food Industry in 1931 . In 1930 , Podgorny became a member of the All @-@ Union Communist Party ( bolsheviks ) . Following his graduation Podgorny started working in the sugar industry . He was promoted to deputy chief engineer of Vinnytsia in 1937 and was promoted in 1939 as the chief engineer of the Kamenetz @-@ <unk> Oblast sugar trusts . By the end of 1939 Podgorny had become Deputy People 's Commissar for Food Industry of the Ukrainian SSR . The next year Podgorny was appointed Deputy People 's Commissar for Food Industry of the Soviet Union . 
 = = Ukraine and national politics ( 1942 – 1963 ) = = 
 Podgorny became the Director of the Moscow Technological Institute of Food Industry in 1942 , during the Great Patriotic War ( World War II ) . After the liberation of Ukraine from the hands of Nazi Germany , Podgorny reestablished Soviet control over Ukraine on the orders of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Ukrainian SSR ) and the Soviet Government . In the post @-@ war years Podgorny regained his old office of Deputy People 's Commissar for Food Industry of the Ukrainian SSR , but was later appointed in 1946 as a Permanent Representative to the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR . In April 1950 he was made First Secretary of the Kharkiv Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine ( CPU ) . In 1953 Podgorny was elevated to Second Secretary of the Central Committee ( CC ) of the CPU . From 1957 to 1963 he was First Secretary of the CC of the CPU . In this role , Podgorny worked on reorganising and modernising the Ukrainian economy , which had been destroyed during the war years . He worked to increase the rate of industrial and agricultural production and to improve people 's welfare . He paid particular attention to improving party organisation and educating new cadres . 
 In 1960 Podgorny became a member of the Politburo ( Political Bureau ) and by 1963 had risen to prominence within the Soviet hierarchy as a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) . As a protégé and close companion of Nikita Khrushchev , he travelled with him to United Nations headquarters in 1960 . He acted as a Soviet emissary to Czechoslovakia , East Germany , Canada , and Yugoslavia . Podgorny 's beliefs were strongly influenced by Khrushchev , and under Leonid Brezhnev 's rule , Podgorny was one of the most liberal members within the Soviet leadership , even more liberal than Premier Alexei Kosygin . 
 Podgorny briefly fell out of Khruschev 's favor in 1961 when he blamed bad corn yields in the Ukrainian SSR on " bad weather " . Khrushchev claimed the crops had been " stolen " and " pilfered " . However , in 1962 , Podgorny reported to Khrushchev that agricultural output had again increased : Under Podgorny 's leadership , the Ukrainian SSR had doubled Ukraine 's supply of grain to the state from the previous year . Because of his handling of agriculture , First World commentators saw Podgorny as one of Khrushchev 's many potential heirs . According to historian Ilya Zemtsov , the author of Chernenko : The Last Bolshevik : The Soviet Union on the Eve of Perestroika , Brezhnev began starting a conspiracy against Khrushchev when he found out that he had chosen Podgorny , and not himself , as his potential successor . The coup evidently took Podgorny by surprise , seeing that he left Moscow on 10 October , two days before the coup was initiated . 
 = = Head of state ( 1965 – 1977 ) = = 
 = = = Appointment and the collective leadership = = = 
 During the 1964 ouster to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary and Premier , Podgorny and Brezhnev appealed to the Central Committee , blaming Khrushchev for economic failures and accusing him of voluntarism and immodest behavior . Influenced by Brezhnev and his allies , Politburo members voted to remove Khrushchev from office . In the aftermath of Khrushchev 's removal , a collective leadership was formed , headed by Brezhnev as First Secretary , Alexei Kosygin as head of government , and Anastas Mikoyan as head of state . Before becoming head of state , Podgorny served as the party 's Second Secretary , and was therefore in charge of the Party 's Organisational Division . In this capacity , Podgorny threatened Brezhnev 's position as First Secretary because the Organisational Division , if Podgorny chose so , could easily be turned into his own power base within the party . Brezhnev allied himself with Alexander Shelepin , the KGB chairman , to oppose both Podgorny and Kosygin . 
 Podgorny 's position was constantly threatened by Brezhnev and his allies . In an article in <unk> Gazeta from February 1965 , the newspaper criticised the Kharkiv Party organisation which Podgorny had previously headed , but also its management of the economy . By indirectly criticising Podgorny , the article raised doubts about his qualifications as a leading member of the Soviet leadership . Podgorny launched a counterattack in his 1965 speech in Baku , Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic , where he criticised the Soviet leadership 's heavy industrial policy . This , as it turned out , would be a move he would regret for life . Instead of offending just Brezhnev and Shelepin , he offended the whole conservative wing of the leadership . To make matters even worse for Podgorny , Mikhail Suslov , who had kept outside of the conflict , sided with Brezhnev , and called his views " revisionist " . Later in 1965 , Podgorny lost his seat in the Secretariat , and on 9 December 1965 he replaced Mikoyan as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet . His removal from the Secretariat also signalled the end of his wish to assume the First Secretaryship . 
 The majority of Politburo members under Brezhnev were conservative communists . Even so , Podgorny remained one of the most liberal @-@ minded members in the Era of Stagnation . Other liberal @-@ minded Politburo members included Kosygin and Andrei Kirilenko . Factionalism within the Soviet leadership in the 1960s led Podgorny to become more active ; he held several speeches in Moscow and went on numerous state visits at the expense of Brezhnev and Kosygin 's popularity . There was speculation in Soviet society that Podgorny was trying to replace Kosygin as Premier , or even Brezhnev as General Secretary , due to his increasing presence in the late 1960s . The 24th Party Congress , while reaffirming Brezhnev 's and Kosygin 's respective positions , made it clear that Podgorny had become a major player in Soviet politics . The collective leadership was eventually left powerless in the late 1970s when Brezhnev had close to full control over the Politburo . 
 = = = Diplomatic protocol = = = 
 In 1967 , just before the outbreak of the Six @-@ Day War , Podgorny delivered an intelligence report to Egyptian Vice President Anwar Sadat which claimed , falsely , that Israeli troops were massing along the Syrian border . That same year , he engaged in a dialogue with Pope Paul VI as part of the pontiff 's <unk> ; the result was greater openness for the Roman Catholic Church in Eastern Europe . In 1971 Podgorny went on two state visits , the first to the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) and the second to North Vietnam ; Kosygin went on a visit to Canada while Brezhnev visited Yugoslavia . Podgorny frequently paid visits to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War to discuss Soviet @-@ Vietnamese foreign relations . In 1973 , Podgorny visited Finland and Mohammed Daoud Khan 's Afghanistan . 
 Brezhnev conspired to oust Podgorny as early as 1970 . The reason was simple : Brezhnev was third , while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol . Since September 1970 Brezhnev tried to form an opposition in the Politburo to oust Podgorny . According to Time , " There was some speculation in Moscow " that if Brezhnev didn 't succeed in removing Podgorny he would establish a Council of State modelled after institutions found in , for example , East Germany ( Staatsrat ) , People 's Republic of Bulgaria and the Socialist Republic of Romania . The post of Chairman of the Council of State would give Brezhnev the top state and party job in the USSR . Brezhnev 's backers were unable , and didn 't even try , to remove Podgorny from the head of state post at the 1970 Central Committee plenum . Brezhnev could count on only five votes , while another seven Politburo members were opposed to granting Brezhnev more power ; removing Podgorny would in fact mean the end of the collective leadership . 
 While Brezhnev was plotting , Podgorny 's position within the Politburo grew stronger . Podgorny had been able to win support from the hardline communists due to Brezhnev 's liberal @-@ minded policy regarding Yugoslavia , military disarmament deals with the First World , and forcing East Germany into a concession with West Germany in the Berlin negotiations . 
 = = = Later tenure = = = 
 In the Politburo Podgorny could count on the support of Gennady Voronov and Petro <unk> . Podgorny was constantly in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues in the Politburo . When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority , and forced to follow their decisions . However , Podgorny was pleased about his position within the leadership , and even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet . As head of state , Podgorny saw little threat to his position , even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called for the expansion of Party activities in the Soviets . 
 With Brezhnev 's position consolidated in the early 1970s , he used Podgorny to weaken Kosygin 's position as Chairman of the Council of Ministers by giving the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet some executive powers . With the help from Brezhnev Podgorny managed to make the Council of Ministers subordinate to the Presidium . However , these changes threatened Brezhnev , and Brezhnev would later order Konstantin Chernenko to take a look at the 1936 Soviet Constitution to find a way to weaken Podgorny 's position . As it turned out there were none , Podgorny 's position as head of state meant that he could in fact block any measures taken by Brezhnev to circumscribe his powers . Chernenko did come up with a solution , to make it law that the Party leader would also become the leader of the Government apparatus . The 1977 Soviet Constitution was drafted to weaken the position of Podgorny by making it law that the Party leader was in fact also leader of the Government . The draft which dealt with the leading role of the Party , and its clear supremacy , in Soviet society was approved by the Soviet leadership . The approval of the 1977 Soviet Constitution is considered Podgorny 's death knell . 
 = = = Removal = = = 
 Podgorny 's removal from office in 1977 has become the most notable example of power transfer in the late Brezhnev Era . According to Robert Vincent Daniels , Podgorny was before his removal the second most powerful man in the Soviet Union , behind Brezhnev but ahead of Premier Kosygin . The post of Chairman of the Presidium had acquired more powers during his tenure , and had changed from a largely honorary office to the second most important office in the USSR . Though there were some Sovietologists who foresaw Podgorny 's fall , the decision to remove Podgorny from the Politburo took the world by surprise . On 24 May 1977 , a unanimous vote was taken by the Central Committee after Grigory Romanov proposed removing Podgorny from the Politburo . The vote seemed to have taken Podgorny by surprise , and immediately after the vote , he got up from his politburo seat to instead sit with the ordinary members . The Central Committee had however only voted him off the Politburo , and Podgorny still retained the position of Chairman of the Presidium . After his removal from the Politburo Podgorny 's name disappeared from Soviet media . The Soviet media told the Soviet people that he had retired due to his stance against détente and producing more consumer goods . Podgorny finally lost his Chairmanship of the Presidium on 16 June 1977 . 
 Due to his advanced age , Brezhnev was regarded as too old to carry out some of the functions of head of state . The Supreme Soviet , on Brezhnev 's orders , established the new post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet , an office equivalent to the post of Vice President . Vasili Kuznetsov , at the age of 76 , was unanimously approved by the Supreme Soviet as First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium . 
 = = Retirement , death and recognition = = 
 Podgorny 's life after his resignation is not well documented . The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen , the President of Finland . There was never any explanation given , nor a denunciation of him , by the Soviet authorities . Podgorny retained his seat in the Supreme Soviet after his downfall . He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the Grand Palace of the Kremlin in November 1978 by <unk> Uomoto , the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union . Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev , Kosygin , and then to Andrei Gromyko , all of whom looked embarrassed by the presence of Podgorny , according to Uomoto . Soon after this incident , Podgorny lost his seat in the Supreme Soviet . In Tretyakov Gallery , Podgorny was removed from the 1977 painting of the Soviet leaders at the Red Square by Dmitriy <unk> in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin . Podgorny died of cancer on 12 January 1983 , and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery . 
 As with many other high @-@ standing Soviet officials , Podgorny was honoured with several awards . He was awarded five Orders of Lenin , one Order of the Red Banner and several medals , as well as being awarded several foreign state prizes by the People 's Republic of Bulgaria , the Mongolian People 's Republic , the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic , and Finland . 
 = Omaha Beach = 
 Omaha Beach was the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German @-@ occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 , during World War II . Omaha is on the coast of Normandy , France , facing the English Channel , and is 8 kilometers ( 5 mi ) long , from east of Sainte @-@ Honorine @-@ des @-@ <unk> to west of Vierville @-@ sur @-@ Mer on the right bank of the Douve River estuary . Landings here were necessary to link the British landings to the east at Gold with the American landing to the west at Utah , thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the Bay of the Seine . Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of United States Army troops , with sea transport , mine sweeping , and a naval bombardment force provided by the United States Navy and Coast Guard as well as elements from the British , Canadian , Free French and other Allied navies . 
 On D @-@ Day , the untested 29th Infantry Division , along with nine companies of U.S. Army Rangers redirected from Pointe du Hoc , were to assault the western half of the beach . The battle @-@ hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half . The initial assault waves , consisting of tanks , infantry , and combat engineer forces , were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow @-@ up waves to land . 
 The primary objective at Omaha was to secure a beachhead of eight kilometres ( 5 miles ) depth , between Port @-@ en @-@ Bessin and the Vire River , linking with the British landings at Gold to the east , and reaching the area of Isigny to the west to link up with VII Corps landing at Utah . Opposing the landings was the German 352nd Infantry Division . Of the 12 @,@ 020 men of the division , 6 @,@ 800 were experienced combat troops , detailed to defend a 53 @-@ kilometer ( 33 mi ) front . The Germans were largely deployed in strongpoints along the coast — the German strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at the water line . 
 Very little went as planned during the landing at Omaha . Difficulties in navigation caused the majority of landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day . The defenses were unexpectedly strong , and inflicted heavy casualties on landing U.S. troops . Under heavy fire , the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles ; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared . Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing , the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach . This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings . Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults , scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points . By the end of the day , two small isolated footholds had been won , which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland , thus achieving the original D @-@ Day objectives over the following days . 
 = = Terrain and defenses = = 
 Omaha was bounded at either end by large rocky cliffs . The crescent @-@ shaped beach presented a gently sloping tidal area averaging 300 m ( 330 yd ) between low and high @-@ water marks . Above the tide line was a bank of shingle 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 ft ) high and up to 15 m ( 49 ft ) wide in places . At the western end , the shingle bank rested against a stone ( further east becoming wood ) sea wall which ranged from 1 @.@ 5 – 4 m ( 5 – 13 ft ) in height . For the remaining two thirds of the beach after the seawall ended , the shingle lay against a low sand embankment . Behind the sand embankment and sea wall was a level shelf of sand , narrow at either end and extending up to 200 m ( 220 yd ) inland in the center , and behind that rose steep escarpments or bluffs 30 – 50 m ( 33 – 55 yd ) high , which dominated the whole beach and were cut into by small wooded valleys or draws at five points along the beach , codenamed west to east D @-@ 1 , D @-@ 3 , E @-@ 1 , E @-@ 3 and F @-@ 1 . 
 The German defensive preparations and the lack of any defense in depth indicated that their plan was to stop the invasion at the beaches . Four lines of obstacles were constructed in the intertidal zone . The first , a non @-@ contiguous line with a small gap in the middle of Dog White and a larger gap across the whole of Easy Red , was 250 m ( 270 yd ) out from the highwater line and consisted of 200 Belgian Gates with mines lashed to the uprights . 30 meters ( 33 yd ) behind these was a continuous line of logs driven into the sand pointing seaward , every third one capped with an anti @-@ tank mine . This defensive measure was not as effective as the Germans would have wished . Another 30 meters ( 33 yd ) shoreward of this line was a continuous line of 450 ramps sloping towards the shore , also with mines attached and designed to force flat @-@ bottomed landing craft to ride up and either flip or detonate the mine . The final line of obstacles was a continuous line of hedgehogs 150 meters ( 160 yd ) from the shoreline . The area between the shingle bank and the bluffs was both wired and mined , and mines were also scattered on the bluff slopes . To some extent , the German barricades set up to prevent tanks advancing on the shores became useful to Allied infantry as they provided cover from machine gun and small arms fire . 
 Coastal troop deployments , comprising five companies of infantry , were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called <unk> ( " resistance nests " ) , numbered WN @-@ 60 in the east to WN @-@ 74 near Vierville in the west , located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire . Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels . As well as the basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns , more than 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints . The heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes . A further 18 anti @-@ tank guns completed the disposition of artillery targeting the beach . Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches , rifle pits , and 85 machine @-@ gun emplacements . No area of the beach was left uncovered , and the disposition of weapons meant that flanking fire could be brought to bear anywhere along the beach . 
 Allied intelligence had identified the coastal defenders as a reinforced battalion ( 800 – 1000 men ) of the 716th Infantry Division . This was a static defensive division estimated to comprise up to 50 % of non @-@ German troops , mostly Russian volunteers and German Volksdeutsche . The recently activated but capable 352nd Infantry Division was believed to be 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) inland at Saint @-@ Lô and was regarded as the most likely force to be committed to a counter @-@ attack . As part of Rommel 's strategy to concentrate defenses at the water 's edge , the 352nd had been ordered forward in March , taking over responsibility for the defense of the portion of the Normandy coast in which Omaha was located . As part of this reorganization , the 352nd also took under its command two battalions of the 726th Grenadier Regiment ( part of the 716th Static Infantry Division ) as well as the 439th Ost @-@ Battalion , which had been attached to the 726th . Omaha Beach fell mostly within ' Coast Defense Sector 2 ' , which stretched westward from Colleville and allocated to the 916th Grenadier Regiment , with the third battalion 726th Grenadier Regiment attached . Two companies of the 726th manned strongpoints in the Vierville area while two companies of the 916th occupied the St. Laurent area strongpoints in the center of Omaha . These positions were supported by the artillery of the first and fourth battalions of the 352nd Artillery Regiment ( twelve 105 mm and four 150 mm howitzers respectively ) . The two remaining companies of the 916th formed a reserve at Formigny , two miles ( 3 km ) inland . East of Colleville , ' Coast Defense Sector 3 ' was the responsibility of the remainder of the 726th Grenadier Regiment . Two companies were deployed at the coast , one in the most easterly series of strongpoints , with artillery support provided by the third battalion of the 352nd Artillery Regiment . The area reserve , comprising the two battalions of the 915th Grenadier Regiment and known as ' Kampfgruppe Meyer ' , was located south @-@ east of Bayeux outside the immediate Omaha area . 
 The failure to identify the reorganization of the defenses was a rare intelligence breakdown for the Allies . Post @-@ action reports still documented the original estimate and assumed that the 352nd had been deployed to the coastal defenses by chance , a few days previously , as part of an anti @-@ invasion exercise . The source of this inaccurate information came from German prisoners of war from the 352nd Infantry Division captured on D @-@ Day as reported by the 16th Infantry S @-@ 3 D @-@ Day Action Report . In fact , Allied intelligence had already become aware of the relocation of the 352nd Infantry Division on June 4 . This information was passed on to V Infantry Corps and 1st Infantry Division HQ through 1st Army , but at that late stage in the operations , no plans were changed . 
 = = Plan of attack = = 
 Omaha was divided into ten sectors , codenamed ( from west to east ) : Charlie , Dog Green , Dog White , Dog Red , Easy Green , Easy White , Easy Red , Fox Green , Fox White , and Fox Red . The initial assault was to be made by two Regimental Combat Teams ( RCT ) , supported by two tank battalions , with two battalions of Rangers also attached . The infantry regiments were organized into three battalions each of around 1 @,@ 000 men . Each battalion was organized as three rifle companies each of up to 240 men , and a support company of up to 190 men . Infantry companies A through D belonged to the 1st battalion of a regiment , E through H to the 2nd , I through M to the 3rd ; the letter ‘ J ’ was not used . ( Individual companies will be referred to in this article by company and regiment , e.g. Company A of the 116th RCT will be ' A / 116 ' ) . In addition , each battalion had a headquarters company of up to 180 men . The tank battalions consisted of three companies , A through C , each of 16 tanks , while the Ranger battalions were organized into six companies , A through F , of around 65 men per company . V Corps ' 56th Signal Battalion was responsible for communications on Omaha Beach with the fleet offshore , especially routing requests for naval gunfire support to the destroyers and USS Arkansas . 
 The 116th RCT of the 29th Infantry Division was to land two battalions in the western four beaches , to be followed 30 minutes later by the third battalion . Their landings were to be supported by the tanks of the 743rd Tank Battalion ; two companies swimming ashore in amphibious DD tanks and the remaining company landing directly onto the beach from assault craft . To the left of the 116th RCT the 16th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division was also to land two battalions with the third following 30 minutes after , on Easy Red and Fox Green at the eastern end of Omaha . Their tank support was to be provided by the 741st Tank Battalion , again two companies swimming ashore and the third landed conventionally . Three companies of the 2nd Ranger Battalion were to take a fortified battery at Pointe du Hoc , three miles ( 5 km ) to the west of Omaha . Meanwhile , C Company 2nd Rangers was to land on the right of the 116th RCT and take the positions at Pointe de la <unk> . The remaining companies of 2nd Rangers and the 5th Ranger Battalion were to follow up at Pointe du Hoc if that action proved to be successful , otherwise they were to follow the 116th into Dog Green and proceed to Pointe du Hoc overland . 
 The landings were scheduled to start at 06 : 30 , " H @-@ Hour " , on a flooding tide , preceded by a 40 @-@ minute naval and 30 @-@ minute aerial bombardment of the beach defenses , with the DD tanks arriving five minutes before H @-@ Hour . The infantry were organized into specially equipped assault sections , 32 men strong , one section to a landing craft , with each section assigned specific objectives in reducing the beach defenses . Immediately behind the first landings the Special Engineer Task Force was to land with the mission of clearing and marking lanes through the beach obstacles . This would allow the larger ships of the follow @-@ up landings to get through safely at high tide . The landing of artillery support was scheduled to start at H + 90 minutes while the main buildup of vehicles was to start at H + 180 minutes . At H + 195 minutes two further Regimental Combat Teams , the 115th RCT of the 29th Infantry Division and the 18th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division were to land , with the 26th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division to be landed on the orders of the V Corps commander . 
 The objective was for the beach defenses to be cleared by H + 2 hours , whereupon the assault sections were to reorganize , continuing the battle in battalion formations . The draws were to be opened to allow traffic to exit the beach by H + 3 hours . By the end of the day , the forces at Omaha were to have established a bridgehead five miles ( 8 km ) deep , linked up with the British 50th Division landed at Gold to the east , and be in position to move on Isigny the next day , linking up with the American VII Corps at Utah to the west . 
 The assault force expected to execute this plan totaled over 34 @,@ 000 men and 3 @,@ 300 vehicles , with naval support provided by two battleships , three cruisers , 12 destroyers , and 105 other ships . These were provided predominantly by the US Navy , but also included British and Free French warships . The 16th RCT ( swollen by 3 @,@ 502 men and 295 vehicles attached for the beach landing ) numbered 9 @,@ 828 troops , 919 vehicles and 48 tanks . To move this force required 2 transport ships , 6 Landing Ships , Tank ( LSTs ) , 53 LCTs , 5 Landing Craft Infantry ( Large ) ( LCI / ( L ) s ) , 81 LCVPs , 18 LCAs , 13 other landing craft , and about 64 DUKWs . Assault craft were crewed by the US Navy , US Coast Guard and the British Royal Navy . 
 = = Initial assault = = 
 Despite these preparations , very little went according to plan . Ten landing craft were swamped by the rough seas before they reached the beach , and several others stayed afloat only because their passengers bailed water out with their helmets . <unk> was prevalent among the troops waiting offshore . On the 16th RCT front , the landing boats passed struggling men in life preservers and on rafts , survivors of the DD tanks which had sunk in the rough sea . Navigation of the landing vehicles was made difficult by the smoke and mist obscuring the landmarks they were to use in guiding themselves in , while a strong current pushed them continually eastward . 
 As the boats approached to within a few hundred yards of the shore , they came under increasingly heavy fire from automatic weapons and artillery . The force discovered only then the ineffectiveness of the pre @-@ landing bombardment . Delayed by the weather and attempting to avoid the landing craft as they ran in , the bombers had dropped their ordnance too far inland , as a result of an order to wait 10 seconds extra before dropping their bombs . In the bombers , this translated to several miles inland , detonating some landmines that were planted by the Germans , but having no real effect on the coastal defenses . Another issue was the equipping of contact @-@ fuse bombs instead of time @-@ delay fuses in a tradeoff between more craters , meaning more cover for advancing infantry , or no craters , meaning easy vehicle access to the beach . 
 = = = Tank landings = = = 
 Because sea conditions were so rough , the decision was made for the 116th RCT to carry the DD tanks of the 743rd tank battalion all the way to the beach , after 27 of the initial 29 DD tanks of the 741st tank battalion swamped while wading to shore . Coming in opposite the heavily defended Vierville draw , Company B of the 743rd Tank Battalion lost all but one of its officers and half of its DD tanks . The other two companies landed to the left of B / 743 without initial loss . On the 16th RCT front , the two DD tanks from the 741st tank battalion that had survived the swim ashore were joined by three others that were landed directly onto the beach because of their LCT 's damaged ramp . The remaining tank company managed to land 14 of its 16 tanks ( although three of these were quickly knocked out ) . 
 = = = Infantry landings = = = 
 Of the nine companies landing in the first wave , only Company A of the 116th RCT at Dog Green and the Rangers to their right landed where intended . E / 116 , aiming for Easy Green , ended up scattered across the two beaches of the 16th RCT area . G / 116 , aiming for Dog White , opened up a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ yard ( 900 m ) gap between themselves and A / 116 to their right when they landed at Easy Green instead . I / 16 drifted so far east it did not land for another hour and a half . 
 As infantry disembarked from the landing craft , they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards ( 45 to 90 m ) out . To reach the beach they had to wade through water sometimes neck deep , and they still had 200 yards ( 180 m ) or more to go when they did reach shore . Those that made it to the shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden . Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms , mortars , artillery , and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire . Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning , as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint , the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders . Some sections of G / 116 and F / 116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed , though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers . G / 116 was able to retain some cohesion , but this was soon lost as they made their way westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives . The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front , where parts of E / 16 , F / 16 and E / 116 had intermingled , making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis @-@ landings . Those scattered sections of E / 116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties , although , having encountered a deep <unk> after being landed on a sandbank , they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore . 
 Casualties were heaviest among the troops landing at either end of Omaha . In the east at Fox Green and the adjacent stretch of Easy Red , scattered elements of three companies were reduced to half strength by the time they gained the relative safety of the shingle , many of them having crawled the 300 yards ( 270 m ) of beach just ahead of the incoming tide . Within 15 minutes of landing at Dog Green on the western end of the beach , A / 116 had been cut to pieces , the leaders among the 120 or so casualties , the survivors reduced to seeking cover at the water 's edge or behind obstacles . The smaller Ranger company to their right had fared a little better , having made the shelter of the bluffs , but were also down to half strength . 
 L / 16 eventually landed , 30 minutes late , to the left of Fox Green , taking casualties as the boats ran in and more as they crossed the 200 yards ( 180 m ) of beach . The terrain at the very eastern end of Omaha gave them enough protection to allow the 125 survivors to organize and begin an assault of the bluffs . They were the only company in the first wave able to operate as a unit . All the other companies were , at best , disorganized , mostly leaderless and pinned down behind the shingle with no hope of carrying out their assault missions . At worst , they had ceased to exist as fighting units . Nearly all had landed at least a few hundred yards off target , and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each boat had been assigned a specific task , this was enough to throw the whole plan off . 
 = = = Engineer landings = = = 
 Like the infantry , the engineers had been pushed off their targets , and only five of the 16 teams arrived at their assigned locations . Three teams came in where there were no infantry or armor to cover them . Working under heavy fire , the engineers set about their task of clearing gaps through the beach obstacles — work made more difficult by loss of equipment , and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind the obstacles they were trying to blow . They also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off the explosives they were working with . Eight men of one team were dragging their pre @-@ loaded rubber boat off the LCM when artillery hit ; only one survived the resulting detonation of their supplies . Another team had just finished laying its explosives when the area was struck by mortar fire . The premature explosion of the charges killed or wounded 19 engineers , as well as some nearby infantry . Nevertheless , the engineers succeeded in clearing six gaps , one each at Dog White and Easy Green on the 116th RCT front , the other four at Easy Red on the 16th RCT front . They had suffered casualties of over 40 % . 
 = = Second assault wave = = 
 With the initial targets <unk> , the second and larger wave of assault landings brought in reinforcements , support weapons and headquarter elements at 07 : 00 to face nearly the same difficulties as had the first . The second wave was larger , and so the defenders ' fire was less concentrated . The survivors of the first wave were unable to provide effective covering fire , and in places the fresh landing troops suffered casualty rates as high as those of the first wave . Failure to clear paths through the beach obstacles also added to the difficulties of the second wave . In addition , the incoming tide was beginning to hide the remaining obstacles , causing high attrition among the landing craft before they had reached the shore . As in the initial landings , difficult navigation caused disruptive <unk> , scattering the infantry and separating vital headquarters elements from their units . 
 On the 116th RCT front , the remainder of the 1st Battalion , B / 116 , C / 116 and D / 116 , were due to land in support of A / 116 at Dog Green . Three boats , including their headquarters and beach @-@ master groups , landed too far west , under the cliffs . Their exact casualties in getting across the beach are unknown , but the one @-@ third to one @-@ half that made it to shore spent the rest of the day pinned down by snipers . Not all sections of the badly scattered B / 116 landed there , but those that did were quickly forced to join those survivors of A / 116 fighting for survival at the water 's edge . Two companies of 2nd Rangers , coming in later on the edge of Dog Green , did manage to reach the seawall , but at the cost of half their strength . 
 To the left of Dog Green sat Dog White , between the Vierville and Les Moulins strongpoints ( defending draws D @-@ 1 and D @-@ 3 ) ; and here was a different story . As a result of earlier mis @-@ landings , and now because of their own mis @-@ landing , the troops of C / 116 found themselves alone at Dog White , with a handful of tanks from the first wave in sight . The smoke from the grass fires covering their advance up the beach , they gained the seawall with few casualties , and were in better shape than any unit on the 116th RCT front so far . Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D / 116 suffered a disastrous landing , the buildup at Dog White continued . C / 116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety . The Ranger commander , recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run @-@ in , ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White . Like the C / 116 , the smoke covered their advance , although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger 's landing . This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group , including the 29th Division assistant commander Brigadier General Norman " Dutch " Cota , was able to land relatively unscathed . 
 Further east , the strongpoint defenses were effective . On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary , the defenses around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy toll on the remaining 2nd Battalion , with H / 116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there . The survivors joined the remnants of F / 116 behind the shingle , and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle . A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins was too weak to have any effect and was forced back down . To their left , mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary , the 116th RCT 's support battalion landed without too much loss , although they did become scattered , and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs . 
 On the 16th RCT front , at the eastern end of Easy Red , was another area between strongpoints . This allowed G / 16 and the support battalion to escape complete destruction in their advance up the beach . Nevertheless , most of G / 16 's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle . The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave ; H / 16 came in a few hundred yards to the left , opposite the E @-@ 3 draw , and suffered for it – they were put out of action for several hours . 
 On the eastern @-@ most beach , Fox Green , elements of five different companies had become entangled , and the situation was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave . Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee , and , having drifted east in the first wave , I / 16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green , at 08 : 00 . Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east , and as they came in under fire , three of the four remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines , and the fourth was hung up on an obstacle . A captain from this company found himself senior officer , and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion . 
 = = = American situation = = = 
 Along with the infantry landing in the second wave , supporting arms began to arrive , meeting the same chaos and destruction as had the rifle companies . Combat engineers , tasked with clearing the exits and marking beaches , landed off @-@ target and without their equipment . Additionally , with the exception of DD tanks , they did not have the benefit of " Hobart 's Funnies " ( a wide range of British @-@ designed , specially adapted armored vehicles specifically designed to penetrate German fixed defenses ) which had been offered to American commanders , and were accepted . The Americans requested all " Funnies " that were based on the Sherman M4 tank chassis , but the vehicles could not be produced in enough quantity to supply both the Commonwealth forces and American forces in time for D @-@ Day . Even if enough could have been produced in time for D @-@ Day there were not enough LCTs available to carry the DD and wading tanks and the " Funnies " . 
 Many half @-@ tracks , jeeps and trucks foundered in deep water ; those that made it ashore soon became jammed up on the narrowing beach , making easy targets for the German defenders . Most of the radios were lost , making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult , and those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity . Except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there , the assault troops had only their personal weapons , which , having been dragged through surf and sand , invariably needed cleaning before they could be used . 
 The survivors at the shingle , many facing combat for the first time , found themselves relatively well @-@ protected from small arms fire , but still exposed to artillery and mortars . In front of them lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from the bluffs above . Morale naturally became a problem . Many groups were leaderless and witnesses to the fate of neighboring troops and landings coming in around them . Wounded men on the beach were drowning in the incoming tide and incoming landing craft were being pounded and set ablaze . 
 = = = German situation = = = 
 As late as 13 : 35 the German 352nd division was reporting that the assault had been hurled back into the sea . From the German vantage point at Pointe de la <unk> , overlooking the whole beach from the western end , it seemed that the assault had been stopped at the beach . An officer there noted that troops were seeking cover behind obstacles , and counted ten tanks burning . By 07 : 35 , the third battalion of the 726th Grenadier Regiment , defending Draw F @-@ 1 on Fox Green beach , was reporting that 100 – 200 American troops had penetrated the front , with troops inside the wire at WN @-@ 62 and WN @-@ 61 attacking the Germans from the rear . Casualties among the defenders were mounting . While the 916th regiment , defending the center of the 352nd zone , was reporting that the landings had been frustrated , it was also requesting reinforcements . The request could not be met , because the situation elsewhere in Normandy was becoming more urgent for the defenders . The reserve regiment , the 915th of the 352nd division , which had earlier been ordered against the American airborne landings to the west of Omaha , was diverted to the Gold zone east of Omaha , the defenses there having crumbled . 
 = = Breakthrough = = 
 The key geographical features that had influenced the landings also influenced the next phase of the battle : the draws , the natural exits off the beaches , were the main targets in the initial assault plan . The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault . In the areas between the draws , at the bluffs , units were able to land in greater strength . Defenses were also weaker away from the draws , thus most advances were made there . 
 The other key aspect of the next few hours was leadership . The original plan was in tatters , with so many units mis @-@ landed , disorganized and scattered . Most commanders had fallen or were absent , and there were few ways to communicate , other than shouted commands . In places , small groups of men , sometimes scratched together from different companies , in some cases from different divisions , were " ... inspired , encouraged or bullied ... " out of the relative safety of the shingle , starting the grueling task of reducing the defenses atop the bluffs . 
 = = = Assaulting the bluffs = = = 
 Survivors of C company 2nd Rangers in the first wave landed on Dog Green around 06 : 45 ; by 07 : 30 , they had scaled the cliffs near Dog White and the Vierville draw . They were joined later by a mis @-@ landed section from B / 116 , and this group spent the better part of the day tying up and eventually taking WN @-@ 73 , which defended draw D @-@ 1 at Vierville . 
 At 07 : 50 , Cota led the charge off of Dog Green , between WN @-@ 68 and WN @-@ 70 , by forcing gaps in the wire with a Bangalore torpedo and wire cutters . Twenty minutes later , the 5th Rangers joined the advance , and blew more openings . The command party established themselves at the top of the bluff , and elements of G / 116 and H / 116 joined them , having earlier moved laterally along the beach , and now the narrow front had widened to the east . Before 09 : 00 , small parties from F / 116 and B / 116 reached the crests just east of Dog White . The right flank of this penetration was covered by the survivors of the 2nd Rangers ’ A and B companies , who had independently fought their way to the top between 08 : 00 and 08 : 30 . They took WN @-@ 70 ( already heavily damaged by naval shells ) , and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland . By 09 : 00 more than 600 American troops , in groups ranging from company sized to just a few men , had reached the top of the bluff opposite Dog White and were advancing inland . 
 The 3rd battalion 116th RCT forced its way across the flats and up the bluff between WN @-@ 66 ( which defended the D @-@ 3 draw at Les Moulins ) , and WN @-@ 65 ( defending the E @-@ 1 draw ) . They advanced in small groups , supported by the heavy weapons of M / 116 , who were held at the base of the bluff . Progress was slowed by mines on the slopes of the bluff , but elements of all three rifle companies , as well as a stray section of G / 116 , had gained the top by 09 : 00 , causing the defenders at WN @-@ 62 to mistakenly report that both WN @-@ 65 and WN @-@ 66 had been taken . 
 Between 07 : 30 and 08 : 30 elements of G / 16 , E / 16 , and E / 116 came together and climbed the bluffs at Easy Red , between WN @-@ 64 ( defending the E @-@ 1 draw ) and WN @-@ 62 ( the E @-@ 3 draw ) . At 09 : 05 , German observers reported that WN @-@ 61 was lost , and that one machine gun was still firing from WN @-@ 62 . 150 men , mostly from G / 16 , having reached the top hampered more by minefields than by enemy fire , continued south to attack the WN @-@ 63 command post on the edge of Colleville . Meanwhile , E / 16 , led by Second Lieutenant John M. Spalding and Captain Robert L. Sheppard V , turned westward along the top of the bluffs , engaging in a two @-@ hour battle for WN @-@ 64 . His small group of just four men had effectively neutralized this point by mid @-@ morning , taking 21 prisoners — just in time to prevent them from attacking freshly landing troops . On the beach below , the 16th RCT commander , Colonel George Taylor had landed at 08 : 15 . With the words " Two kinds of people are staying on this beach , the dead and those who are going to die – now let 's get the hell out of here ! " he organized groups of men regardless of their unit , putting them under the command of the nearest non @-@ commissioned officer and sending them through the area opened up by G / 16 . By 09 : 30 , the regimental command post was set up just below the bluff crest , and the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 16th RCT were being sent inland as they reached the crest . 
 On Fox Green , at the eastern end of Omaha , four sections of L / 16 had survived their landing intact and were now leading elements of I / 16 , K / 16 and E / 116 up the slopes . With supporting fire from the heavy weapons of M / 16 , tanks and destroyers , this force eliminated WN @-@ 60 , which defended the draw at F @-@ 1 ; by 09 : 00 , the 3rd battalion 16th RCT was moving inland . 
 = = = Naval support = = = 
 The only artillery support for the troops making these tentative advances was from the navy . Finding targets difficult to spot , and in fear of hitting their own troops , the big guns of the battleships and cruisers concentrated fire on the flanks of the beaches . The destroyers were able to get in closer , and from 08 : 00 began engaging their own targets . At 09 : 50 , two minutes after the McCook destroyed a 75 mm gun position in WN @-@ 74 , the destroyers were ordered to get as close in as possible . Some approached within 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 900 m ) several times , scraping bottom and risking running aground . An engineer who had landed in the first wave at Fox Red , watching the Frankford steaming in towards shore , thought she had been badly hit and was being beached . Instead , she turned parallel to the beach and cruised westwards , guns blazing at targets of opportunity . Thinking she would turn back out to sea , the engineer soon saw that she had instead begun backing up , guns still firing . At one point , gunners aboard the Frankford saw an immobilized tank at the water 's edge , still firing . Watching the fall of its shot , they followed up with a salvo of their own . In this manner , the tank acted as the ship 's fire control party for several minutes . 
 = = = Pre @-@ invasion naval bombardment = = = 
 General Bradley reviewing Allied troops in England training for D @-@ Day , promised the soldiers that the Germans on the beach would be blasted with naval gunfire before the landing . " You men should consider yourself lucky . You are going to have ringside seats for the greatest show on earth , " he said , meaning naval gunfire . " 
 Rear Admiral John L. Hall , Jr . , ( Commander Task Force 124 , the " Omaha " Beach Assault Force ) , strongly disapproved of what he considered to be the small amount of air and naval bombardment used . Hall was recorded saying " It 's a crime to send me on the biggest amphibious attack in history with such inadequate naval gunfire support . " 
 Later analysis of naval support during the pre @-@ landing phase concluded that the navy had provided inadequate bombardment , given the size and extent of the planned assault . Kenneth P. Lord , a U.S. Army planner for the D @-@ Day invasion , says that , upon hearing the naval gunfire support plan for Omaha , which limited support to one battleship , two cruisers and six destroyers , he and other planners were very upset — especially in light of the tremendous naval gunfire support given to landings in the Pacific . 
 Historian Adrian R. Lewis postulates that American casualties would have been greatly reduced if a longer barrage had been implemented . 
 = = = German defenses inland = = = 
 While the coastal defenses had not turned back the invasion at the beach , they had broken up and weakened the assault formations struggling through them . The German emphasis on this Main Line of Resistance ( MLR ) meant that defenses further inland were significantly weaker , and based on small pockets of prepared positions smaller than company sized in strength . This tactic was enough to disrupt American advances inland , making it difficult even to reach the assembly areas , let alone achieve their D @-@ Day objectives . As an example of the effectiveness of German defenses despite weakness in numbers , the 5th Ranger battalion was halted in its advance inland by a single machine gun position hidden in a hedgerow . One platoon attempted to outflank the position , only to run into another machine gun position to the left of the first . A second platoon dispatched to take this new position ran into a third , and attempts to deal with this met with fire from a fourth position . The success of the MLR in blocking the movement of heavy weapons off the beach meant that , after four hours , the Rangers were forced to give up on attempts to move them any further inland . 
 = = Beachhead = = 
 Despite penetrations inland , the key beach objectives had not been achieved . The draws necessary for the movement of vehicles off the beach had not been opened , and the strongpoints defending these were still putting up a spirited resistance . The failure to clear beach obstacles forced subsequent landings to concentrate on Easy Green and Easy Red . 
 Where vehicles were landing , they found a narrow strip of beach with no shelter from enemy fire . Around 08 : 30 , commanders suspended all such landings . This caused a jam of landing craft out to sea . The DUKWs had a particularly hard time of it in the rough conditions . Take the 13 DUKWs carrying the 111th Field Artillery battalion of the 116th RCT : five were swamped soon after disembarking from the LCT , four were lost as they circled in the rendezvous area waiting to land , and one capsized as they turned for the beach . Two were destroyed by enemy fire as they approached the beach and the lone survivor managed to offload its howitzer to a passing craft before it also succumbed to the sea . This one gun eventually landed in the afternoon . 
 The official record of Omaha reports that " ... the tanks were leading a hard life ... " . According to the commander of the 2nd battalion 116th RCT the tanks " ... saved the day . They shot the hell out of the Germans , and got the hell shot out of them . " As the morning progressed the beach defenses were gradually being reduced , often by tanks . Scattered along the length of the beach , trapped between the sea and the impassable shingle embankment and with no operating radios amongst the commanders , tanks had to be controlled individually . This was perilous work . The commanding officer of the 111th Field Artillery , who had landed ahead of his unit , was killed as he tried to direct the fire of one tank . The command group of the 741st tank battalion lost three out their group of five in their efforts . Additionally , the commander of the 743rd tank battalion became a casualty as he approached one of his tanks with orders . When naval gunfire was brought to bear against the strong @-@ points defending the E @-@ 3 draw , a decision was made to try to force this exit with tanks . Colonel Taylor ordered all available tanks into action against this point at 11 : 00 . Only three were able to reach the rallying point , and two were knocked out as they attempted to go up the draw , forcing the remaining tank to back off . 
 Reinforcement regiments were due to land by battalion , beginning with the 18th RCT at 09 : 30 on Easy Red . The first battalion to land , 2 / 18 , arrived at the E @-@ 1 draw 30 minutes late after a difficult passage through the congestion off shore . Casualties were light , though . Despite the existence of a narrow channel through the beach obstacles , the ramps and mines there accounted for the loss 22 LCVPs , 2 LCI ( L ) s and 4 LCTs . Supported by tank and subsequent naval fire , the newly arrived troops took the surrender at 11 : 30 of the last strong @-@ point defending the entrance to the E @-@ 1 draw . Although a usable exit was finally opened , congestion prevented an early exploitation inland . The three battalions of the 115th RCT , scheduled to land from 10 : 30 on Dog Red and Easy Green , came in together and on top of the 18th RCT landings at Easy Red . The confusion prevented the remaining two battalions of the 18th RCT from landing until 13 : 00 , and delayed the move off the beach of all but 2 / 18 , which had exited the beach further east before noon , until 14 : 00 . Even then , this movement was hampered by mines and enemy positions still in action further up the draw . 
 By early afternoon , the strong @-@ point guarding the D @-@ 1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy . But without enough force on the ground to mop up the remaining defenders , the exit could not be opened . Traffic was eventually able to use this route by nightfall , and the surviving tanks of the 743rd tank battalion spent the night near Vierville . 
 The advance of the 18th RCT cleared away the last remnants of the force defending the E @-@ 1 draw . When engineers cut a road up the western side of this draw , it became the main route inland off the beaches . With the congestion on the beaches thus relieved , they were re @-@ opened for the landing of vehicles by 14 : 00 . Further congestion on this route , caused by continued resistance just inland at St. Laurent , was bypassed with a new route , and at 17 : 00 , the surviving tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ordered inland via the E @-@ 1 draw . 
 The F @-@ 1 draw , initially considered too steep for use , was also eventually opened when engineers laid down a new road . In the absence of any real progress opening the D @-@ 3 and E @-@ 3 draws , landing schedules were revised to take advantage of this route , and a company of tanks from the <unk> tank battalion were able to reach the high ground by 20 : 00 . 
 Approaches to the exits were also cleared , with minefields lifted and holes blown in the embankment to permit the passage of vehicles . As the tide receded , engineers were also able to resume their work of clearing the beach obstacles , and by the end of the evening , 13 gaps were opened and marked .

 Observing the build @-@ up of shipping off the beach , and in an attempt to contain what were regarded as minor penetrations at Omaha , a battalion was detached from the 915th Regiment being deployed against the British to the east . Along with an anti @-@ tank company , this force was attached to the 916th Regiment and committed to a counterattack in the Colleville area in the early afternoon . It was stopped by " firm American resistance " and reported heavy losses . The strategic situation in Normandy precluded the reinforcement of the weakened 352nd Division . The main threat was felt by the Germans to be the British beachheads to the east of Omaha , and these received the most attention from the German mobile reserves in the immediate area of Normandy . Preparations were made to bring up units stationed for the defense of Brittany , southwest of Normandy , but these would not arrive quickly and would be subject to losses inflicted in transit by overwhelming Allied air superiority . The last reserve of the 352nd Division , an engineer battalion , was attached to the 916th Regiment in the evening . It was deployed to defend against the expected attempt to break out of the Colleville @-@ St. Laurent beachhead established on the 16th RCT front . At midnight General Dietrich Kraiss , commander of the 352nd Division , reporting the total loss of men and equipment in the coastal positions , advised that he had sufficient forces to contain the Americans on D + 1 but that he would need reinforcements thereafter , to be told that there were no more reserves available .

 Following the penetrations inland , confused hard @-@ fought individual actions pushed the foothold out barely a mile and a half ( 2 @.@ 5 km ) deep in the Colleville area to the east , less than that west of St. Laurent , and an isolated penetration in the Vierville area . Pockets of enemy resistance still fought on behind the American front line , and the whole beachhead remained under artillery fire . At 21 : 00 the landing of the 26th RCT completed the planned landing of infantry , but losses in equipment were high , including 26 artillery pieces , over 50 tanks , about 50 landing craft and 10 larger vessels . 
 Only 100 of the 2 @,@ 400 tons of supplies scheduled to be landed on D @-@ Day were landed . Casualties for V Corps were estimated at 3 @,@ 000 killed , wounded and missing . The heaviest casualties were taken by the infantry , tanks and engineers in the first landings . The 16th and 116th RCT 's lost about 1 @,@ 000 men each . Only five tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ready for action the next day . The German 352nd division suffered 1 @,@ 200 killed , wounded and missing ; about 20 % of its strength . Its deployment at the beach caused such problems that Lieutenant General Omar Bradley , commander of the U.S. First Army , at one stage considered evacuating Omaha , while Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery considered the possibility of diverting V Corps forces through Gold . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The foothold gained on D @-@ Day at Omaha , itself two isolated pockets , was the most tenuous across all the D @-@ Day beaches . With the original objective yet to be achieved , the priority for the Allies was to link up all the Normandy beachheads . During the course of June 7 , while still under sporadic shellfire , the beach was prepared as a supply area . Surplus cargo ships were deliberately sunk to form an artificial breakwater and , while still less than planned , 1 @,@ 429 tons of stores were landed that day . 
 With the beach assault phase completed the <unk> reorganized into infantry regiments and battalions and over the course of the next two days achieved the original D @-@ Day objectives . On the 1st divisional front the 18th Infantry Regiment blocked an attempt by two companies from the 916th and 726th Grenadiers to break out of WN @-@ 63 and Colleville , both of which were subsequently taken by the 16th Infantry Regiment which also moved on Port @-@ en @-@ Bessin . The main advance was made by the 18th Infantry Regiment , with the 3rd battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment attached , south and south @-@ eastwards . The heaviest opposition was encountered at Formigny where troops of the 2nd battalion 915th Grenadiers had reinforced the headquarters troops of 2nd battalion 916th Grenadiers . Attempts by 3 / 26 and B / 18 with support from the tanks of B / 745 were held off and the town did not fall until the morning of June 8 . The threat of an armored counterattack kept the 18th Infantry Regiment on the defensive for the rest of June 8 . The 26th Infantry Regiment 's three battalions , having been attached to the 16th , 18th and 115th Regiments the previous day , spent June 8 reassembling before pushing eastwards , forcing the 1st battalion of the German 726th Grenadiers to spend the night extricating itself from the pocket thus forming between Bayeux and Port @-@ en @-@ Bessin . By the morning of June 9 the 1st Division had established contact with the British XXX Corps , thus linking Omaha with Gold . 
 On the 29th divisional front two battalions of the 116th Infantry Regiment cleared the last defenders from the bluffs while the remaining 116th battalion joined the Rangers in their move west along the coast . This force relieved the 2nd Ranger companies who were holding Pointe du Hoc on June 8 and subsequently forced the German 914th Grenadiers and the 439th Ost @-@ Battalion to withdraw from the <unk> area which lay further to the west . Early on June 7 WN @-@ 69 defending St. Laurent was abandoned and the 115th Infantry Regiment was therefore able to push inland to the south @-@ west , reaching the Formigny area on June 7 and the original D @-@ Day phase line the following day . The third regiment of 29th Division ; the 175th , started landing on June 7 . By the morning of June 9 this regiment had taken Isigny and on the evening of the following day forward patrols established contact with the 101st Airborne Division , thus linking Omaha with Utah . 
 In the meantime , the original defender at Omaha , the 352nd Division , was being steadily reduced . By the morning of June 9 the division was reported as having been " ... reduced to ' small groups ' ... " while the 726th Grenadier Regiment had " ... practically disappeared . " By June 11 the effectiveness of the 352nd was regarded as " very slight " , and by June 14 the German corps command was reporting the 352nd as completely used up and needing to be removed from the line . 
 Once the beachhead had been secured , Omaha became the location of one of the two Mulberry harbours , prefabricated artificial harbors towed in pieces across the English Channel and assembled just off shore . Construction of ' Mulberry A ' at Omaha began the day after D @-@ Day with the scuttling of ships to form a breakwater . By D + 10 the harbor became operational when the first pier was completed ; LST 342 docking and unloading 78 vehicles in 38 minutes . Three days later the worst storm to hit Normandy in 40 years began to blow , raging for three days and not abating until the night of June 22 . The harbor was so badly damaged that the decision was taken not to repair it ; supplies being subsequently landed directly on the beach until fixed port facilities were captured . In the few days that the harbor was operational , 11 @,@ 000 troops , 2 @,@ 000 vehicles and 9 @,@ 000 tons of equipment and supplies were brought ashore . Over the 100 days following D @-@ Day more than 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 tons of supplies , 100 @,@ 000 vehicles and 600 @,@ 000 men were landed , and 93 @,@ 000 casualties were evacuated , via Omaha . 
 Today at Omaha jagged remains of the harbor can be seen at low tide . The shingle bank is no longer there , cleared by engineers in the days following D @-@ Day to facilitate the landing of supplies . The beachfront is more built @-@ up and the beach road extended , villages have grown and merged , but the geography of the beach remains as it was and the remains of the coastal defenses can still be visited . At the top of the bluff overlooking Omaha near Colleville is the American cemetery . As late as 1988 , particles of shrapnel , as well as glass and iron beads resulting from munitions explosions , have been found in the sand of the beach .

 Mariah Carey 's twelfth studio album , Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel , was released in 2009 . It produced the US Billboard Hot 100 top ten and platinum certified track " Obsessed " . However , subsequent single releases failed to replicate its success , with " I Want to Know What Love Is " peaking at number 60 on the Hot 100 , and " H.A.T.E.U. " reaching number 72 on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs chart . Carey revealed that she intended to re @-@ release Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel as a remix album in early 2010 , titled Angels Advocate , which would consist of remixes of the standard songs with new featured artists , including Mary J. Blige , Snoop Dogg , Trey Songz , R. Kelly , T @-@ Pain , Gucci Mane and OJ da Juiceman . A release date of February 23 , 2010 , was slated , and then pushed back to March 9 .

On May 5 , Dupri confirmed that he and Carey were in the early stages of production for the album , that Bryan @-@ Michael Cox and Johntá Austin were involved in the project and that they hoped to release a single by the end of the year . Roger Friedman of Showbiz411 revealed some information about the album on June 3 , 2010 , saying " Mariah ’ s Christmas album is said to be very lush , with lots of strings and no hip hop . A lot of it is said to be ' live ' and there ’ s an <unk> " and would feature a new version of her 1994 Christmas single , " All I Want for Christmas Is You " . It was reported by Showbiz411 in August 2010 that Carey had enlisted Broadway composer Marc Shaiman to work on the then untitled album ; the magazine described the pairing as " unusual " but noted that the outcome could be " colossal " . On September 1 , 2010 , Rap @-@ Up exclusively revealed the title of the album , Merry Christmas II You , and that it would be released on November 2 with original songs as well as covers .

 Track five is an interlude which is another medley titled " The First Noel " / " Born Is the King " . " The First Noel " section is a soulful down @-@ tempo song which consists of Carey delivering a piano @-@ and @-@ voice epilogue backed by an 808 drum machine , while " Born Is the King " is a piece of " pure baby @-@ making magic " , according to Juzwiak .

"

Guerra noted that Carey adds some " club bounce " to " Here Comes Santa Claus ( Right Down Santa Claus Lane ) " , while Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine thought that the " <unk> Celebration " part of the medley " recycles the monolithic beat from Kurtis Blow ’ s instructive " Christmas Rappin ' . " " Charlie Brown Christmas " is a variation of the A Charlie Brown Christmas animated musical television special . A piece of nostalgia , as described by Guerra , it also makes use of traditional religious carols . A fourth medley titled " O Come All Ye Faithful " / " Hallelujah Chorus " features Carey 's mother , Patricia , who performs opera during the " Hallelujah Chorus " section . According to Bill Lamb of About.com , " Here Mariah Carey is at her best as she threatens to take everything too far sonically with operatic tones , impossibly high notes , and melisma in full force , but somehow it all holds together in exhilarating fashion . " 
 Track ten is a live recording of " O Holy Night " by Carey at the WPC in South Central Los Angeles . It makes use of the singer 's " deeper , throatier tones " and " octave @-@ scaling high notes " . It is followed by " One Child " , written by Carey and James Poyser , a retelling of the birth of Jesus . It encompasses a range of genres , including Christmas , adult contemporary , urban contemporary and religious music . " All I Want for Christmas Is You – Extra Festive " is re @-@ recording of the original , which makes use of extra chimes , " beefier " production with softened bell rings and an added kick drum and new vocals .

About.com writer Bill Lamb praised the album , writing that it has a " relaxed , comfortable " which is " engaging " . He wrote that the original compositions were " solid " , placing emphasis on " Oh Santa ! " , " One Child " and " When Christmas Comes " , but felt that " Christmas Time Is Here Again " was overshadowed by its heavy orchestration . He concluded by writing " Mariah Carey does know her way around Christmas albums . " Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle echoed Lamb 's sentiments , adding that the album ought to boost Carey 's career . He was complimentary of its overall feel , writing that manages to capture the " same magic " as her previous Christmas album , Merry Christmas , and that the original songs fit " snugly " with the Christmas classics . He finished his review with " There 's enough sweet spirit here to keep the holidays merry , musical and bright . " 
 Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that the four new original compositions gave it " a lively modern feel , " and highlighted " Oh Santa ! " and " When Christmas Comes " as examples . He continued to write that although some covers , such as " Auld Lang Syne " and " Charlie Brown Christmas " sound " stiff " , the album as a complete body of work is " cheerful and engaging " and is a worthy successor to Carey 's previous Christmas album . BBC Music 's Mike Diver thought that although the album is not necessarily " clever " , it is " expectedly big " , and that while " Oh Santa ! " is not in the " same league " as " All I Want for Christmas Is You " , it 's a perfect stocking filler . 
 Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz disliked the two original ballads , " Christmas Time Is Here Again " and " One Child " , describing them " both thick with gooey orchestration " , but praised " Oh Santa ! " and " When Christmas Comes " for their uptempo melodies . However , she was confused by the re @-@ recording of " All I Want for Christmas Is You " , saying that " It 's hard to figure out what 's ' extra festive ' " , and quipped that it is " far easier to determine what 's wrong with ' Auld Lang Syne ' ( an awkward dance beat ) " . Ganz concluded with " the LP 's warm heart is in the right place . " Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the album two and a half stars our of five , writing " Everything about Carey ’ s sequel to 1994 ’ s buoyant , if , in retrospect , safe , Merry Christmas is as desperate and habitual as it is reassuringly predictable . " While he continued to label it as an " incredibly <unk> album , " he also wrote that it is a " remarkably comforting listen " . He felt that Merry Christmas II You was not a sequel , or a remake , but rather an attempt at rewinding time on Carey 's part . Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was critical of Merry Christmas II You . He described " One Child " as a " needless retelling " , " Oh Santa ! " as trying too hard and too difficult to sing along to and " All I Want for Christmas Is You ( Extra Festive ) " as a desperate attempt at Carey <unk> herself for re @-@ recording her own song . " The near @-@ crazed desperation to please listeners for her own sake is all over Merry Christmas II You : A " gift " to her fans ( or so she claims ) that they , of course , must pay for , it 's her fascinating , career @-@ long saga of self @-@ obsession in a nutshell .

 = Percy Grainger = 
 Percy Aldridge Grainger ( 8 July 1882 – 20 February 1961 ) was an Australian @-@ born composer , arranger and pianist . In the course of a long and innovative career he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century . He also made many adaptations of other composers ' works . Although much of his work was experimental and unusual , the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk @-@ dance tune " Country Gardens " . 
 Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt . Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London , where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer , composer and collector of original folk melodies . As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music , forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg . He became a champion of Nordic music and culture , his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters . 
 In 1914 , Grainger moved to the United States , where he lived for the rest of his life , though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia . He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during 1917 – 18 , and took American citizenship in 1918 . After his mother 's suicide in 1922 he became increasingly involved in educational work . He also experimented with music machines that he hoped would supersede human interpretation . In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne , his birthplace , as a monument to his life and works and as a future research archive . As he grew older he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions , while writing little new music . After the Second World War , ill health reduced his levels of activity , and he considered his career a failure . He gave his last concert in 1960 , less than a year before his death . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Family background = = = 
 Percy Grainger 's father , John Grainger ( 1854 – 1917 ) , was an English @-@ born architect who emigrated to Australia in 1877 . He won professional recognition for his design of the Princes Bridge across the Yarra River in Melbourne . In October 1880 he married Rose Annie Aldridge , daughter of Adelaide hotelier George Aldridge . The couple settled in Brighton , a suburb of Melbourne where their only son , christened George Percy Grainger , was born on 8 July 1882 . 
 John Grainger was an accomplished artist , with broad cultural interests and a wide circle of friends . These included David Mitchell , whose daughter Helen later gained worldwide fame as an operatic soprano under the name Nellie Melba . John 's claims to have " discovered " her are unfounded , although he may have offered her encouragement . John was a heavy drinker and a womaniser who , Rose learned after the marriage , had fathered a child in England before coming to Australia . His promiscuity placed heavy strains upon the relationship , particularly when Rose discovered shortly after Percy 's birth that she had contracted a form of syphilis from her husband . Despite this , the <unk> stayed together until 1890 , when John went to England for medical treatment . After his return to Australia they lived apart ; the burden of raising Percy fell to Rose , while John pursued his career as chief architect to the Western Australian Department of Public Works . He also designed Nellie Melba 's home , Coombe Cottage , at Coldstream . 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Except for three months ' formal schooling as a 12 @-@ year @-@ old , during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates , Percy was educated at home . Rose , an autodidact with a dominating presence , supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages , art and drama . From his earliest lessons Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture ; writing late in life he maintained that the Icelandic " Saga of Grettir the Strong " was " the strongest single artistic influence on my life " . As well as showing precocious musical talents , he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist , to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music . At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst , a German <unk> then considered to be Melbourne 's leading piano teacher . Grainger 's first known composition , " A Birthday Gift to Mother " , is dated 1893 . Pabst arranged Grainger 's first public concert appearances , at Melbourne 's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894 . The boy played works by Bach , Beethoven , Schumann and Scarlatti , and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press . 
 After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894 , Grainger 's new piano tutor , Adelaide Burkitt , arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894 , at Melbourne 's Royal Exhibition Building . The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist ; nevertheless , his performance delighted the Melbourne critics who dubbed him " the flaxen @-@ haired phenomenon who plays like a master " . This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt , Germany , an institution recommended by William Laver , head of piano studies at Melbourne 's Conservatorium of music . Financial assistance was secured through a fund @-@ raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide , after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895 . Although he never returned permanently to Australia , Grainger maintained considerable patriotic feelings for his native land , and was proud of his Australian heritage . 
 = = = Frankfurt = = = 
 In Frankfurt , Rose established herself as a teacher of English ; her earnings were supplemented by contributions from John Grainger , who had settled in Perth . The Hoch Conservatory 's reputation for piano teaching had been enhanced by the tenure , until 1892 , of Clara Schumann as head of piano studies . Grainger 's piano tutor was James Kwast , who developed his young pupil 's skills to the extent that , within a year , Grainger was being lauded as a prodigy . Grainger had difficult relations with his original composition teacher , Iwan Knorr ; he withdrew from Knorr 's classes to study composition privately with an amateur composer and folk @-@ music enthusiast , Karl Klimsch , whom he would later honour as " my only composition teacher " . 
 Together with a group of slightly older British students – Roger Quilter , Balfour Gardiner , Cyril Scott and Norman O 'Neill , all of whom became his friends – Grainger helped form the " Frankfurt Group " , whose long @-@ term objective was to rescue British and Scandinavian music from what they considered the negative influences of central European music . Encouraged by Klimsch , Grainger turned away from composing classical pastiches reminiscent of Handel , Haydn and Mozart , and developed a personal compositional style the originality and maturity of which quickly impressed and astonished his friends . At this time Grainger discovered the poetry of Rudyard Kipling and began setting it to music ; according to Scott , " No poet and composer have been so suitably wedded since Heine & Schumann " . 
 After accompanying her son on an extended European tour in the summer of 1900 Rose , whose health had been poor for some time , suffered a nervous collapse and could no longer work . To replace lost income Grainger began giving piano lessons and public performances ; his first solo recital was in Frankfurt on 6 December 1900 . Meanwhile he continued his studies with Kwast , and increased his repertoire until he was confident he could maintain himself and his mother as a concert pianist . Having chosen London as his future base , in May 1901 Grainger abandoned his studies and , with Rose , left Frankfurt for England . 
 Before leaving Frankfurt , Grainger had fallen in love with Kwast 's daughter Mimi ; in an autobiographical essay dated 1947 he admits to being " already sex @-@ crazy " at this time . John Bird , Grainger 's biographer , also records that during his Frankfurt years Grainger began to develop sexual appetites that were " distinctly abnormal " ; by the age of 16 he had started to experiment in flagellation and other sado @-@ masochistic practices , which he continued to pursue through most of his adult life . Bird surmises that Grainger 's fascination with themes of punishment and pain derived from the harsh discipline to which Rose had subjected him as a child .

 In London , Grainger 's charm , good looks and talent ( with some assistance from the local Australian community ) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a pianist by wealthy patrons , and was soon performing in concerts in private homes . The Times critic recorded after one such appearance that Grainger 's playing " revealed rare intelligence and a good deal of artistic insight " . In 1902 he was presented by the socialite <unk> Lowrey to Queen Alexandra , who thereafter frequently attended his London recitals . Lowrey , 20 years Grainger 's senior , traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours – he termed the relationship a " love @-@ serve job " . She was the first woman with whom he had sex ; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced " an overpowering landslide " of feeling , and that " I thought I was about to die . If I remember correctly , I only experienced fear of death . I don 't think that any joy entered into it " . 
 In February 1902 Grainger made his first appearance as a piano soloist with an orchestra , playing Tchaikovsky 's first piano concerto with the Bath Pump Room Orchestra . In October of that year he toured Britain in a concert party with Adelina Patti , the Italian @-@ born opera singer . Patti was greatly taken by the young pianist and prophesied a glorious career for him . The following year he met the German @-@ Italian composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni . Initially the two men were on cordial terms ( Busoni offered to give Grainger lessons free of charge ) and as a result , Grainger spent part of the 1903 summer in Berlin as Busoni 's pupil . However , the visit was not a success ; as Bird notes , Busoni had expected " a willing slave and adoring disciple " , a role Grainger was not willing to fulfil . Grainger returned to London in July 1903 ; almost immediately he departed with Rose on a 10 @-@ month tour of Australia , New Zealand and South Africa , as a member of a party organised by the Australian contralto Ada Crossley . 
 = = = Emergent composer = = = 
 Before going to London Grainger had composed numerous Kipling settings , and his first mature orchestral pieces . In London , when he found time he continued to compose ; a letter to Balfour Gardiner dated 21 July 1901 indicates that he was working on his Marching Song of Democracy ( a Walt Whitman setting ) , and had made good progress with the experimental works Train Music and Charging <unk> . In his early London years he also composed Hill Song Number 1 ( 1902 ) , an instrumental piece much admired by Busoni . 
 In 1905 , inspired by a lecture given by the pioneer folksong historian Lucy Broadwood , Grainger began to collect original folksongs . Starting at Brigg in Lincolnshire , over the next five years he gathered and transcribed more than 300 songs from all over the country , including much material that had never been written down before . From 1906 Grainger used a phonograph , one of the first collectors to do so , and by this means he assembled more than 200 Edison cylinder recordings of native folk singers . These activities coincided with what Bird calls " the halcyon days of the ' First English Folksong Revival ' " . 
 As his stature in the music world increased , Grainger became acquainted with many of its leading figures , including Vaughan Williams , Elgar , Richard Strauss and Debussy . In 1907 he met Frederick Delius , with whom he achieved an immediate rapport – the two musicians had similar ideas about composition and harmony , and shared a dislike for the classical German masters . Both were inspired by folk music ; Grainger gave Delius his setting of the folksong Brigg Fair , which the older composer developed into his famous orchestral rhapsody , dedicated to Grainger . The two remained close friends until Delius 's death in 1934 . 
 Grainger first met Grieg at the home of the London financier Sir Edgar Speyer , in May 1906 . As a student Grainger had learned to appreciate the Norwegian 's harmonic originality , and by 1906 had several Grieg pieces in his concert repertoire , including the piano concerto . Grieg was greatly impressed with Grainger 's playing , and wrote that the Australian was " a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love . " During 1906 – 07 the two maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence , which culminated in Grainger 's ten @-@ day visit in July 1907 to the composer 's Norwegian home , " Troldhaugen " near Bergen . Here the two spent much time revising and rehearsing the piano concerto in preparation for that year 's Leeds Festival . Their plans for a long @-@ term working relationship were thwarted by Grieg 's sudden death in September 1907 ; nevertheless , this relatively brief acquaintance had a considerable impact on Grainger , and he championed Grieg 's music for the rest of his life . 
 After fulfilling a hectic schedule of concert engagements in Britain and continental Europe , in August 1908 Grainger accompanied Ada Crossley on a second Australasian tour , during which he added several cylinders of Maori and Polynesian music to his collection of recordings . He had resolved to establish himself as a top @-@ ranking pianist before promoting himself as a composer , though he continued to compose both original works and folksong settings . Some of his most successful and most characteristic pieces , such as " Mock Morris " , " Handel in the Strand " , " Shepherd 's Hey " and " Molly on the Shore " date from this period . In 1908 he obtained the tune of " Country Gardens " from the folk music specialist Cecil Sharp , though he did not fashion it into a performable piece for another ten years . 
 In 1911 Grainger finally felt confident enough of his standing as a pianist to begin large @-@ scale publishing of his compositions . At the same time , he adopted the professional name of " Percy Aldridge Grainger " for his published compositions and concert appearances . In a series of concerts arranged by Balfour Gardiner at London 's Queen 's Hall in March 1912 , five of Grainger 's works were performed to great public acclaim ; the band of thirty guitars and mandolins for the performance of " Fathers and Daughters " created a particular impression . On 21 May 1912 Grainger presented the first concert devoted entirely to his own compositions , at the Aeolian Hall , London ; the concert was , he reported , " a sensational success " . A similarly enthusiastic reception was given to Grainger 's music at a second series of Gardiner concerts the following year . 
 In 1905 Grainger began a close friendship with Karen Holten , a Danish music student who had been recommended to him as a piano pupil . She became an important confidante ; the relationship persisted for eight years , largely through correspondence . After her marriage in 1916 she and Grainger continued to correspond and occasionally meet until her death in 1953 . Grainger was briefly engaged in 1913 to another pupil , Margot Harrison , but the relationship foundered through a mixture of Rose 's over @-@ possessiveness and Grainger 's indecision .

 In April 1914 Grainger gave his first performance of Delius 's piano concerto , at a music festival in Torquay . Thomas Beecham , who was one of the festival 's guest conductors , reported to Delius that " Percy was good in the forte passages , but made far too much noise in the quieter bits " . Grainger was receiving increasing recognition as a composer ; leading musicians and orchestras were adding his works to their repertoires . His decision to leave England for America in early September 1914 , after the outbreak of the First World War , damaged his reputation among his patriotically minded British friends . Grainger wrote that the reason for this abrupt departure was " to give mother a change " – she had been unwell for years . However , according to Bird , Grainger often explained that his reason for leaving London was that " he wanted to emerge as Australia 's first composer of worth , and to have laid himself open to the possibility of being killed would have rendered his goal unattainable " . The Daily Telegraph music critic Robin Legge accused him of cowardice , and told him not to expect a welcome in England after the war , words that hurt Grainger deeply . 
 Grainger 's first American tour began on 11 February 1915 with a recital at New York 's Aeolian Hall . He played works by Bach , Brahms , Handel and Chopin alongside two of his own compositions : " Colonial Song " and " Mock Morris " . In July 1915 Grainger formally registered his intention to apply for US citizenship . Over the next two years his engagements included concerts with Nellie Melba in Boston and Pittsburgh and a command performance before President Woodrow Wilson . In addition to his concert performances , Grainger secured a contract with the Duo @-@ Art Company for making pianola rolls , and signed a recording contract with Columbia Records . 
 In April 1917 Grainger received news of his father 's death in Perth . On 9 June 1917 , after America 's entry into the war , he enlisted as a bandsman in the U.S. Army with the 15th Coastal Artillery Corps Band in New York City . He had joined as a saxophonist , though he records learning the oboe : " I long for the time when I can blow my oboe well enough to play in the band " . In his 18 months ' service , Grainger made frequent appearances as a pianist at Red Cross and Liberty bond concerts . As a regular encore he began to play a piano setting of the tune " Country Gardens " . The piece became instantly popular ; sheet music sales quickly broke many publishing records . The work was to become synonymous with Grainger 's name through the rest of his life , though he came in time to detest it . On 3 June 1918 he became a naturalised American citizen . 
 = = = Career zenith = = = 
 After leaving the army in January 1919 , Grainger refused an offer to become conductor of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and resumed his career as a concert pianist . He was soon performing around 120 concerts a year , generally to great critical acclaim , and in April 1921 reached a wider audience by performing in a cinema , New York 's Capitol Theatre . Grainger commented that the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation for his playing than those at established concert venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Aeolian . In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique at Chicago Musical College , the first of many such educational duties he would undertake in later years . 
 Amid his concert and teaching duties , Grainger found time to rescore many of his works ( a habit he continued throughout his life ) and also to compose new pieces : his Children 's March : Over the Hills and Far Away , and the orchestral version of The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart both originated in this period . He also began to develop the technique of elastic scoring , a form of flexible orchestration which enabled works to be performed by different numbers of players and instrument types , from small chamber groups up to full orchestral strength . 
 In April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in White Plains , New York . This was his home for the remainder of his life . From the beginning of 1922 Rose 's health deteriorated sharply ; she was suffering from delusions and nightmares , and became fearful that her illness would harm her son 's career . Because of the closeness of the bond between the two , there had long been rumours that their relationship was incestuous ; in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough . From her last letter to Grainger , dated 29 April , it seems that this confrontation unbalanced Rose ; on 30 April , while Grainger was touring on the West Coast , she jumped to her death from an office window on the 18th floor of the Aeolian Building in New York City . The letter , which began " I am out of my mind and cannot think properly " , asked Grainger if he had ever spoken to Lotta of " improper love " . She signed the letter : " Your poor insane mother " . 
 = = = Inter @-@ war years = = = 
 = = = = Traveller = = = = 
 After Rose 's funeral , Grainger sought solace in a return to work . In autumn 1922 he left for a year @-@ long trip to Europe , where he collected and recorded Danish folksongs before a concert tour that took him to Norway , the Netherlands , Germany and England . In Norway he stayed with Delius at the latter 's summer home . Delius was by now almost blind ; Grainger helped fulfil his friend 's wish to see a Norwegian sunset by carrying him ( with some assistance ) to the top of a nearby mountain peak . He returned to White Plains in August 1923 . 
 Although now less committed to a year @-@ round schedule of concerts , Grainger remained a very popular performer . His eccentricities , often exaggerated for publicity reasons , reportedly included running into auditoriums in gym kit and leaping over the piano to create a grand entrance . While he continued to revise and rescore his compositions , he increasingly worked on arrangements of music by other composers , in particular works by Bach , Brahms , Fauré and Delius . Away from music , Grainger 's preoccupation with Nordic culture led him to develop a form of English which , he maintained , reflected the character of the language before the Norman conquest . Words of Norman or Latin origin were replaced by supposedly Nordic word @-@ forms , such as " blend @-@ band " ( orchestra ) , " <unk> " ( lecturer ) and " writ @-@ piece " ( article ) . He called this " blue @-@ eyed " English . His convictions of Nordic superiority eventually led Grainger , in letters to friends , to express his views in crudely racial and anti @-@ Semitic terms ; the music historian David Pear describes Grainger as , " at root , a racial bigot of no small order " . 
 Grainger made further trips to Europe in 1925 and 1927 , collecting more Danish folk music with the aid of the octogenarian ethnologist Evald Tang Kristensen ; this work formed the basis of the Suite on Danish Folksongs of 1928 – 30 . He also visited Australia and New Zealand , in 1924 and again in 1926 . In November 1926 , while returning to America , he met Ella Ström , a Swedish @-@ born artist with whom he developed a close friendship . On arrival in America the pair separated , but were reunited in England the following autumn after Grainger 's final folksong expedition to Denmark . In October 1927 the couple agreed to marry . Ella had a daughter , Elsie , who had been born out of wedlock in 1909 . Grainger always acknowledged her as a family member , and developed a warm personal relationship with her . 
 Although Bird asserts that before her marriage , Ella knew nothing of Grainger 's sado @-@ masochistic interests , in a letter dated 23 April 1928 ( four months before the wedding ) Grainger writes to her : " As far as my taste goes , blows [ with the whip ] are most thrilling on breasts , bottom , inner thighs , <unk> " . He later adds , " I shall <unk> <unk> [ sic ] understand if you cannot in any way see yr way to follow up this hot wish of mine " . The couple were married on 9 August 1928 at the Hollywood Bowl , at the end of a concert which , in honour of the bride , had included the first performance of Grainger 's bridal song " To a Nordic Princess " . 
 = = = = Educator = = = = 
 From the late 1920s and early 1930s Grainger became involved increasingly with educational work in schools and colleges , and in late 1931 accepted a year 's appointment for 1932 – 33 as professor of music at New York University ( NYU ) . In this role he delivered a series of lectures under the heading " A General Study of the Manifold Nature of Music " , which introduced his students to a wide range of ancient and modern works . On 25 October 1932 his lecture was illustrated by Duke Ellington and his band , who appeared in person ; Grainger admired Ellington 's music , seeing harmonic similarities with Delius . On the whole , however , Grainger did not enjoy his tenure at NYU ; he disliked the institutional formality , and found the university generally unreceptive to his ideas . Despite many offers he never accepted another formal academic appointment , and refused all offers of honorary degrees . His New York lectures became the basis for a series of radio talks which he gave for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1934 – 35 ; these were later summarised and published as Music : A Commonsense View of All Types . In 1937 Grainger began an association with the Interlochen International Music Camp , and taught regularly at its summer schools until 1944 . 
 = = = = Innovator = = = = 
 The idea of establishing a Grainger Museum in Australia had first occurred to Grainger in 1932 . He began collecting and recovering from friends letters and artifacts , even those demonstrating the most private aspects of his life , such as whips , bloodstained shirts and revealing photographs . In September 1933 he and Ella went to Australia to begin supervising the building work . To finance the project , Grainger embarked on a series of concerts and broadcasts , in which he subjected his audiences to a vast range of the world 's music in accordance with his " universalist " view . Controversially , he argued for the superior achievements of Nordic composers over traditionally recognised masters such as Mozart and Beethoven . 
 Among various new ideas , Grainger introduced his so @-@ called " free @-@ music " theories . He believed that conformity with the traditional rules of set scales , rhythms and harmonic procedures amounted to " absurd goose @-@ stepping " , from which music should be set free . He demonstrated two experimental compositions of free music , performed initially by a string quartet and later by the use of electronic theremins . He believed that ideally , free music required non @-@ human performance , and spent much of his later life developing machines to fulfil this vision . 
 While the building of the museum proceeded , the <unk> visited England for several months in 1936 , during which Grainger made his first BBC broadcast . In this , he conducted " Love Verses from The Song of Solomon " in which the tenor soloist was the then unknown Peter Pears . After spending 1937 in America , Grainger returned to Melbourne in 1938 for the official opening of the Museum ; among those present at the ceremony was his old piano teacher Adelaide Burkitt . The museum did not open to the general public during Grainger 's lifetime , but was available to scholars for research . 
 In the late 1930s Grainger spent much time arranging his works in settings for wind bands . He wrote A Lincolnshire Posy for the March 1937 convention of the American Band Masters ' Association in Milwaukee , and in 1939 , on his last visit to England before the Second World War , he composed " The Duke of Marlborough 's Fanfare " , giving it the subtitle " British War Mood Grows " .

 The outbreak of war in Europe in September 1939 curtailed Grainger 's overseas travelling . In the autumn of 1940 , alarmed that the war might precipitate an invasion of the United States eastern seaboard , he and Ella moved to Springfield , Missouri , in the centre of the continent . From 1940 Grainger played regularly in charity concerts , especially after the attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the war in December 1941 ; the historian Robert Simon calculates that Grainger made a total of 274 charity appearances during the war years , many of them at Army and Air force camps . In 1942 a collection of his Kipling settings , the Jungle Book cycle , was performed in eight cities by the choir of the Gustavus Adolphus College from St. Peter , Minnesota . 
 = = = Postwar decline = = = 
 Exhausted from his wartime concerts routine , Grainger spent much of 1946 on holiday in Europe . He was experiencing a sense of career failure ; in 1947 , when refusing the Chair of Music at Adelaide University , he wrote : " If I were 40 years younger , and not so crushed by defeat in every branch of music I have essayed , I am sure I would have welcomed such a chance " . In January 1948 he conducted the premiere of his wind band setting of " The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart " , written for the Goldman Band to celebrate the 70th birthday of its founder . Afterwards , Grainger denigrated his own music as " commonplace " while praising Darius Milhaud 's Suite Française , with which it had shared the programme . 
 On 10 August 1948 , Grainger appeared at the London Proms , playing the piano part in his Suite on Danish Folksongs with the London Symphony Orchestra under Basil Cameron . On 18 September he attended the Last Night of the Proms , standing in the promenade section for Delius 's Brigg Fair . Over the next few years several friends died : Gardiner in 1950 , Quilter and Karen Holten in 1953 . In October 1953 Grainger was operated on for abdominal cancer ; his fight against this disease would last for the rest of his life . He continued to appear at concerts , often in church halls and educational establishments rather than major concert venues . In 1954 , after his last Carnegie Hall appearance , Grainger 's long promotion of Grieg 's music was recognised when he was awarded the St. Olav Medal by King Haakon of Norway . However , a growing bitterness was becoming evident in his writings and correspondence ; in a letter to his lifelong friend , the Danish composer Herman Sandby , he bemoaned the continuing ascendency in music of the " German form " , and asserted that " all my compositional life I have been a leader without followers " . 
 After 1950 Grainger virtually ceased to compose . His principal creative activity in the last decade of his life was his work with Burnett Cross , a young physics teacher , on free music machines . The first of these was a relatively simple device controlled by an adapted pianola . Next was the " Estey @-@ reed tone @-@ tool " , a form of giant harmonica which , Grainger <unk> informed his stepdaughter Elsie in April 1951 , would be ready to play free music " in a few weeks " . A third machine , the " Cross @-@ Grainger Kangaroo @-@ pouch " , was completed by 1952 . Developments in transistor technology encouraged Grainger and Cross to begin work on a fourth , entirely electronic machine , which was incomplete when Grainger died . 
 In September 1955 Grainger made his final visit to Australia , where he spent nine months organising and arranging exhibits for the Grainger Museum . He refused to consider a " Grainger Festival " , as suggested by the Australian Broadcasting Commission , because he felt that his homeland had rejected him and his music . Before leaving Melbourne , he deposited in a bank a parcel that contained an essay and photographs related to his sex life , not to be opened until 10 years after his death . 
 = = = Last years = = = 
 By 1957 Grainger 's physical health had markedly declined , as had his powers of concentration . Nevertheless , he continued to visit Britain regularly ; in May of that year he made his only television appearance , in a BBC " Concert Hour " programme when he played " Handel in the Strand " on the piano . Back home , after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season . On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten , the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence . He agreed to visit Britten 's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959 , but was prevented by illness . Sensing that death was drawing near , he made a new will , bequeathing his skeleton " for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum " . This wish was not carried out . 
 Through the winter of 1959 – 60 Grainger continued to perform his own music , often covering long distances by bus or train ; he would not travel by air . On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert , at Dartmouth College in Hanover , New Hampshire , although by now his illness was affecting his concentration . On this occasion his morning recital went well , but his conducting in the afternoon was , in his own words , " a fiasco " . Subsequently confined to his home , he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others ; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott 's early songs . His last letters , written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961 , record attempts to work , despite failing eyesight and hallucinations : " I have been trying to write score for several days . But I have not succeeded yet . " 
 Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961 , at the age of 78 . His body was flown to Adelaide where , on 2 March , he was buried in the Aldridge family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery , alongside Rose 's ashes . Ella survived him by 18 years ; in 1972 , aged 83 , she married a young archivist , Stewart Manville . She died at White Plains on 17 July 1979 . 
 = = Music = = 
 Grainger 's own works fall into two categories : original compositions and folk music arrangements . Besides these , he wrote many settings of other composers ' works . Despite his conservatory training he rebelled against the disciplines of the central European tradition , largely rejecting conventional forms such as symphony , sonata , concerto and opera . With few exceptions his original compositions are miniatures , lasting between two and eight minutes . Only a few of his works originated as piano pieces , though in due course almost all of them were , in his phrase , " dished up " in piano versions . 
 The conductor John Eliot Gardiner describes Grainger as " a true original in terms of orchestration and imaginative instrumentation " , whose terseness of expression is reminiscent in style both of the 20th century Second Viennese School and the Italian madrigalists of the 16th and 17th centuries . Malcolm Gillies , a Grainger scholar , writes of Grainger 's style that " you know it is ' Grainger ' when you have heard about one second of a piece " . The music 's most individual characteristic , Gillies argues , is its texture – " the weft of the fabric " , according to Grainger . Different textures are defined by Grainger as " smooth " , " grained " and " prickly " . 
 Grainger was a musical democrat ; he believed that in a performance each player 's role should be of equal importance . His elastic scoring technique was developed to enable groups of all sizes and combinations of instruments to give effective performances of his music . Experimentation is evident in Grainger 's earliest works ; irregular rhythms based on rapid changes of time signature were employed in Love Verses from " The Song of Solomon " ( 1899 ) , and Train Music ( 1901 ) , long before Stravinsky adopted this practice . In search of specific sounds Grainger employed unconventional instruments and techniques : <unk> , theremins , marimbas , musical glasses , harmoniums , banjos , and ukuleles . In one early concert of folk music , Quilter and Scott were conscripted as performers , to whistle various parts . In " Random Round " ( 1912 – 14 ) , inspired by the communal music @-@ making he had heard in the Pacific Islands on his second Australasian tour , Grainger introduced an element of chance into performances ; individual vocalists and instrumentalists could make random choices from a menu of variations . This experiment in " aleatory " composition presaged by many decades the use of similar procedures by avant @-@ garde composers such as Berio and Stockhausen . 
 The brief " Sea Song " of 1907 was an early attempt by Grainger to write " beatless " music . This work , initially set over 14 irregular bars and occupying about 15 seconds of performing time , was a forerunner of Grainger 's free music experiments of the 1930s . Grainger wrote : " It seems to me absurd to live in an age of flying , and yet not be able to execute tonal glides and curves " . The idea of tonal freedom , he said , had been in his head since as a boy of eleven or twelve he had observed the wave @-@ movements in the sea . " Out in nature we hear all kinds of lovely and touching " free " ( non @-@ harmonic ) combinations of tones ; yet we are unable to take up these beauties ... into the art of music because of our archaic notions of harmony " . In a 1941 letter to Scott , Grainger acknowledged that he had failed to produce any large @-@ scale works in the manner of a Bach oratorio , a Wagner opera or a Brahms symphony , but excused this failure on the grounds that all his works prior to the mid @-@ 1930s had been mere preparations for his free music . 
 As a student , Grainger had learned to appreciate the music of Grieg , and came to regard the Norwegian as a paragon of Nordic beauty and greatness . Grieg in turn described Grainger as a new way forward for English composition , " quite different from Elgar , very original " . After a lifetime interpreting Grieg 's works , in 1944 Grainger began adapting the Norwegian 's E minor Piano Sonata , Op. 7 as a " Grieg @-@ Grainger Symphony " , but abandoned the project after writing 16 bars of music . By this time , Grainger acknowledged that he had not fulfilled Grieg 's high expectations of him , either as a composer or as a pianist . He also reflected on whether it would have been better , from the point of view of his development as a composer , had he never met the <unk> , " sweet and dear though they were to me " . 
 Grainger was known for his musical experimentation and did not hesitate to exploit the capabilities of the orchestra . One early ambitious work was The Warriors ( 1913 ) , an 18 @-@ minute suite which he dedicated to Delius . The music , which mixes elements of other Grainger works with references to Arnold Bax , Arnold Schönberg and Richard Strauss , requires a huge orchestral ensemble alongside at least three pianos – in one performance , Grainger used nineteen pianos with thirty pianists – to be played by " exceptionally strong vigorous players " . Critics were undecided as to whether the work was " magnificent " , or merely " a magnificent failure " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Grainger considered himself an Australian composer who , he said , wrote music " in the hopes of bringing honor and fame to my native land " . However , much of Grainger 's working life was spent elsewhere , and the extent to which he influenced Australian music , within his lifetime and thereafter , is debatable . His efforts to educate the Australian musical public in the mid @-@ 1930s were indifferently received , and did not attract disciples ; writing in 2010 , the academic and critic Roger Covell identifies only one significant contemporary Australian musician – the English @-@ born horn player , pianist and conductor David Stanhope – working in the Grainger idiom . In 1956 , the suggestion by the composer Keith Humble that Grainger be invited to write music for the opening of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne was rejected by the organisers of the Games . 
 Grainger was a life @-@ long atheist and believed he would only endure in the body of work he left behind . To assist that survival he established the Grainger Museum , which was given little attention before the mid @-@ 1970s ; it was initially regarded as evidence either of an over @-@ large ego or of extreme eccentricity . Since then the University of Melbourne 's commitment to the museum has , Covell asserts , " rescued [ it ] permanently from academic denigration and belittlement " . Its vast quantities of materials have been used to investigate not only Grainger 's life and works , but those of contemporaries whom Grainger had known : Grieg , Delius , Scott and others . The Grainger home at 7 Cromwell Place , White Plains , New York , is now the Percy Grainger Library and is a further repository of memorabilia and historic performance material , open to researchers and visitors . 
 In Britain , Grainger 's main legacy is the revival of interest in folk music . His pioneering work in the recording and setting of folksongs greatly influenced the following generation of English composers ; Benjamin Britten acknowledged the Australian as his master in this respect . After hearing a broadcast of some Grainger settings , Britten declared that these " [ knocked ] all the Vaughan Williams and R. O. Morris arrangements into a cocked hat " . In the United States , Grainger left a strong educational legacy through his involvement , over 40 years , with high school , summer school and college students . Likewise , his innovative approaches to instrumentation and scoring have left their mark on modern American band music ; Timothy <unk> , a conductor and teacher of band music in Europe and America , has described him as " the only composer of stature to consider military bands the equal , if not the superior , in expressive potential to symphony orchestras . " Grainger 's attempts to produce " free music " by mechanical and later electronic means , which he considered his most important work , produced no follow @-@ up ; they were quickly overtaken and nullified by new technological advances . Covell nevertheless remarks that in this endeavour , Grainger 's dogged resourcefulness and ingenious use of available materials demonstrate a particularly Australian aspect of the composer 's character – one of which Grainger would have been proud . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 In 1945 Grainger devised an informal ratings system for composers and musical styles , based on criteria that included originality , complexity and beauty . Of forty composers and styles , he ranked himself equal ninth – behind Wagner and Delius , but well ahead of Grieg and Tchaikovsky . Nevertheless , in his later years he frequently denigrated his career , for example writing to Scott : " I have never been a true musician or true artist " . His failure to be recognised as a composer for anything beyond his popular folk @-@ song arrangements was a source of frustration and disappointment ; for years after his death the bulk of his output remained largely unperformed . From the 1990s an increase in the number of Grainger recordings has brought a revival of interest in his works , and has enhanced his reputation as a composer . An unsigned tribute published on the Gramophone website in February 2011 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Grainger 's death opined that " though he would never be put on a pedestal to join the pantheon of immortals , he is unorthodox , original and deserves better than to be dismissed by the more snooty arbiters of musical taste " . 
 Of Grainger the pianist , The New York Times critic Harold Schonberg wrote that his unique style was expressed with " amazing skill , personality and vigor " . The early enthusiasm which had greeted his concert appearances became muted in later years , and reviews of his performances during the final ten years of his life were often harsh . However , Britten regarded Grainger 's late recording of the Grieg concerto , from a live performance at Aarhus in 1957 , as " one of the noblest ever committed to record " – despite the suppression of the disc for many years , because of the proliferation of wrong notes and other faults . Brian Allison from the Grainger Museum , referring to Grainger 's early displays of artistic skills , has speculated that had John Grainger 's influence not been removed , " Percy Aldridge Grainger may today be remembered as one of Australia 's leading painters and designers , who just happened to have a latent talent as a pianist and composer " . The ethnomusicologist John <unk> , while acknowledging Grainger 's contribution to social and cultural aspects of music , nevertheless writes that if the continental foundation of Grainger 's musical education had not been " undermined by dilettantism and the disastrous influence of his mother , I am sure that his ultimate contribution to the world of music would have been much greater " . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 Between 1908 and 1957 Grainger made numerous recordings , usually as pianist or conductor , of his own and other composers ' music . His first recordings , for The Gramophone Company Ltd ( later HMV ) , included the cadenza to Grieg 's piano concerto ; he did not record a complete version of this work on disc until 1945 . Much of his recording work was done between 1917 and 1931 , under contract with Columbia . At other times he recorded for Decca ( 1944 – 45 and 1957 ) , and Vanguard ( 1957 ) . Of his own compositions and arrangements , " Country Gardens " , " Shepherd 's Hey " and " Molly on the Shore " and " Lincolnshire Posy " were recorded most frequently ; in recordings of other composers , piano works by Bach , Brahms , Chopin , Grieg , Liszt and Schumann figure most often . Grainger 's complete 78 rpm solo piano recordings are now available on compact disc as a CD box set . 
 During his association with the Duo @-@ Art company between 1915 and 1932 , Grainger made around 80 piano rolls of his own and others ' music using a wooden robot designed to play a concert grand piano via an array of precision mechanical fingers and feet ; <unk> of many of these rolls have subsequently been recorded on to compact disc . This reproduction system allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the Albert Hall , London , during the 1988 last night of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Grieg 's Piano Concerto . 
 Since Grainger 's death , recordings of his works have been undertaken by many artists and issued under many different labels . In 1995 Chandos Records began to compile a complete recorded edition of Grainger 's original compositions and folk settings . Of 25 anticipated volumes , 19 had been completed as of 2010 ; these were issued as a CD boxed set in 2011 , to mark the 50th anniversary of the composer 's death . 
 = Spider @-@ Man : One More Day = 
 " One More Day " is a four @-@ part , 2007 comic book crossover storyline , connecting the three main Spider @-@ Man series concurrently published by Marvel Comics at the time . Written by J. Michael Straczynski and Joe Quesada , with art by Quesada , this story arc concludes the fallout of Spider @-@ Man 's actions during the 2007 Civil War crossover . " One More Day " starts in The Amazing Spider @-@ Man # 544 , continues in Friendly Neighborhood Spider @-@ Man # 24 and The Sensational Spider @-@ Man ( vol . 2 ) # 41 , and concludes in Amazing Spider @-@ Man # 545 . 
 After his Aunt May has been shot , Spider @-@ Man seeks help to save her life . He encounters the demon Mephisto , who offers to save her life if Spider @-@ Man gives him his marriage . Spider @-@ Man and his wife Mary Jane Watson agree , and this part of their history is erased so that , effectively , they have never been married . Additionally , the demon erases the world 's collective memory of Spider @-@ Man 's secret identity , which had been exposed in Civil War # 2 . The storyline set the stage for a restructuring of the Spider @-@ Man titles , resulting in the cancellation of Friendly Neighborhood Spider @-@ Man and The Sensational Spider @-@ Man , with Amazing Spider @-@ Man revamped as a thrice @-@ monthly publication . 
 The decision to abruptly end Peter Parker and Mary Jane 's marriage and the events of " One More Day " were heavily criticized upon the series ' conclusion , although the artwork received praise . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Marvel Comics editor @-@ in @-@ chief Joe Quesada felt dissolving the Peter Parker and Mary Jane marriage and returning Spider @-@ Man to his roots was necessary to preserve the longevity of the character for the next 20 or 30 years . Quesada said he and other previous editors @-@ in @-@ chief had long been seeking an opportunity to begin a new methodology in which to tell Spider @-@ Man stories , but had not found a reasonable way to do so . Quesada said , " It 's very easy to un @-@ marry a character , or fix something like that : you just do a huge universal retcon , and say a few events in history didn 't happen . But that 's really not the way we do it here at Marvel . " Quesada found an opportunity to address this in the events of the 2007 Civil War mini @-@ series , which resulted in the unmasking of Spider @-@ Man 's identity to the public . Quesada knew J. Michael Straczynski was planning to end his run as a Marvel writer , so he personally approached Straczynski to propose " One More Day " as his final project . 
 The ideas for " One More Day " began to develop almost two years before its release , at one of Marvel 's creative summits for creators and editors . Quesada , Straczynski , Brian Michael Bendis , Mark Millar , Jeph Loeb , Tom Brevoort and Axel Alonso developed the concept between them , and Ed Brubaker and Dan Slott added more at the next summit . " One More Day " was announced as the concluding storyline of Straczynski 's run on Amazing Spider @-@ Man in early 2007 , and Quesada was named as the artist for the storyline . Although Quesada had become more selective in choosing projects to do as an artist since becoming editor @-@ in @-@ chief , he felt compelled to do the art for One More Day because he felt very close to the story , and because since he had been talking about the project for so long , he felt he " needed to put my money where my mouth is . " 
 While no plot details were given , Marvel issued a promotional image in February that consisted solely of the line " What would you do ... with one more day ? " against a background of spider webbing . At a panel at the San Diego Comic Con in June 2007 , Joe Quesada gave few details about the story , but described it as " a Peter @-@ MJ story . " At the same panel , Marvel editor Tom Brevoort announced that Amazing Spider @-@ Man would become the sole main Spider @-@ Man title , and would be published three times a month . 
 Due to Quesada 's known dislike of Mary Jane and Peter Parker 's marriage , fans began to speculate he intended to dissolve their marriage in one form or another . Quesada felt that 1987 's " The Wedding ! " story happened due to an editorial decision , and that Jim Shooter mirrored events Stan Lee had planned for the Spider @-@ Man comic strip in order to maximize any publicity generated . 
 Straczynski surprised many when he publicly revealed : " There 's a lot that I don 't agree with , and I made this very clear to everybody within shouting distance at Marvel , especially Joe Quesada ... there was a point where I made the decision , and told Joe , that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the <unk> arc . Eventually , Joe talked me out of that decision because at the end of the day , I don 't want to sabotage Joe or Marvel , and I have a lot of respect for both of those . " Quesada explained this disagreement with Straczynski , stating that their rift was primarily over the " methodology " of how to erase Peter and Mary Jane 's marriage , but Straczynski was on board with the editorial mandate of undoing the Parkers ' marriage . 
 Various Marvel writers , including Brian Michael Bendis , Mark Millar , Ed Brubaker and incoming Amazing Spider @-@ Man writer Dan Slott had a hand in developing the story . During the course of the story 's development , Quesada claims that he and Straczynski made plans to resurrect Gwen Stacy alongside Harry Osborn in the final chapter . This plot twist was discarded after numerous Marvel editors and writers lobbied for the character to remain dead . According to Quesada , Straczynski 's original script for the storyline 's fourth issue involved changes to continuity going as far back as 1971 . Peter would have helped Harry Osborn get into rehab for his drug addiction immediately , which would have allowed a number of rewrites . Mary Jane would have remained in a relationship with Harry , Gwen would not have been killed and ultimately Peter 's marriage to Mary Jane would not have taken place . Quesada realized that these changes would have far @-@ reaching consequences for both historical and forthcoming storylines , so he made the decision to change Straczynski 's story . While Peter and Mary Jane were to have remained a couple for the purposes of back @-@ story , they were simply not a married couple . Quesada also described " One More Day " as an emotional climax of sorts and resolution for the relationship between Peter Parker and Tony Stark , who had developed a father @-@ son @-@ like bond during the " Civil War " storyline . However , Quesada hinted the paths of the two characters could cross again in the future due to planned storylines for Iron Man . 
 Quesada , answering questions for Comic Book Resources , said every story that happened in the Spider @-@ Man canon still " counted " , with the only change being that , due to the world 's newly revised memories , Peter and Mary Jane did not marry due to some unknown incident and the official unmasking of his identity to the public during the 2007 Civil War mini @-@ series has been forgotten . A " back and forth " developed between Quesada and J. Michael Straczynski in separate interviews and messages , with Straczynski outlining some of his original plans for the " retcon " , and conversations he had with Quesada about the storyline . Quesada said , " We 're committed to preserving as much of these stories as is humanly possible , " but he added the changing of certain elements is inevitable . For example , he sees the storyline in which Mary Jane was pregnant as never having happened . Also , Spider @-@ Man lost the organic webshooters that he gained in the " Avengers <unk> " storyline , and the other spider @-@ like powers that he gained in the 2005 @-@ 2006 storyline , " The Other . " Quesada commented that in removing those powers and bringing back Spider @-@ Man 's mechanical webshooters , he was returning " an element that [ he ] felt needed to be brought back into Peter 's world , " and that the " mechanical webshooters demonstrate Peter 's ingenuity and overall smarts . " 
 Quesada sees Peter 's making a " deal with the Devil " as a villain ( Mephisto ) taking advantage of someone at his weakest moment . This , he feels , is a better resolution than Peter and Mary Jane getting divorced , which would indicate " they gave up on their love , that their life in love together was so awful , so stressful , so unfulfilling that they had to raise a red flag and walk away from it . They quit on their marriage and even more tragic , ( they ) quit on each other . Instead , we had them make a deal with the devil . ' Cause that isn 't as bad . " Quesada went on to say , " Peter and MJ didn 't quit on their love , they sacrificed it to save a life , that to me is a pretty heroic story . " 
 = = = Release and delays = = = 
 The four issues that comprised " One More Day " were originally scheduled to ship weekly in August 2007 . The story encountered delays due to Quesada 's art duties conflicting with his job as editor @-@ in @-@ chief .

 The events of " One More Day " began in Amazing Spider @-@ Man # 544 , where Peter Parker 's Aunt May is shown slowly dying from a gunshot wound sustained during the events of Civil War and " Spider @-@ Man : Back in Black " . Peter is forced to ask Tony Stark for financial assistance , and then seeks counsel with Doctor Strange . The latter informs Peter that he can do nothing to grant Aunt May her life back . However , he helps Peter seek the aid of several others including Doctor Doom , the High Evolutionary , Reed Richards , and Doctor Octopus . Peter attempts to go back in time using a magic spell without Strange 's approval , harming himself in the process . Strange heals his wounds and sends him on his way , encouraging him to be by his Aunt 's side at her death . 
 On his way to the hospital , Peter is confronted by a little girl , who says she holds the answer to his problem . He talks to the little girl , who runs off . While pursuing her , Peter encounters a group of men ; a woman in red informs him these are alternate versions of himself , from alternate timelines where he never became Spider @-@ Man . The woman in red transforms into the demon Mephisto , who tells Peter he can save Aunt May . As payment , Mephisto wants not Peter 's soul , but his marriage to Mary Jane . Peter and Mary Jane are given until midnight the following night to decide their answer and , after several hours agonizing over the choice , they agree to the deal , as long as knowledge of Peter 's secret identity is erased from the world . Mary Jane also whispers to Mephisto another , unspecified offer in return for Mephisto putting Peter 's life back exactly how it was and " [ giving ] him a chance at happiness . " Finally , Mephisto reveals to the couple that his disguise as the little girl was in fact their future daughter , but she will never exist because of their decision . This future daughter is not to be confused with May " Mayday " Parker ( Spider @-@ Girl ) . May " Mayday " Parker is the baby that Peter Parker and Mary Jane had at the end of the Clone Saga from the 1990s and would grow up to be Spider @-@ Girl if Norman Osborn never killed her . 
 Mephisto then changes history so that Peter and Mary Jane never married , and no one remembers whose face is underneath Spider @-@ Man 's mask . Peter wakes up alone in bed , once again living with Aunt May . He attends a party being held for his best friend Harry Osborn ( previously thought to have died in Spectacular Spider @-@ Man # 200 ) , who introduces Lilly Hollister and Carlie Cooper . Peter glimpses Mary Jane sadly leaving the party . The guests all toast to a " Brand New Day . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 One More Day was panned by fans and critics . IGN reviewer Jesse Schedeen described Amazing Spider @-@ Man # 545 as " undoubtedly the worst comic Marvel published in 2007 " and a " deus ex machina of the highest order . " He did admit that writer Straczynski " had a great handle on the Peter / Mary Jane dynamic , " making their potentially final moments mean something , and that Quesada 's artistic style made sense given the dark tone . However , he also dismissed the story as " infuriating and downright disrespectful to anyone who has come to love Spider @-@ Man comics over the years . " IGN published two " Additional Take " reviews for Amazing Spider @-@ Man # 545 . Bryan Joel said that he 'd been a " vocal supporter " of " Brand New Day " , but summarized the <unk> story as " flip , weightless , and painfully brief . " Richard George stated that " One More Day " " could prove to be the best example of editorial influence gone horribly , horribly wrong " and " in trying to preserve the appeal of Peter Parker , Joe Quesada has actually managed to fundamentally undermine the character . " Both Joel and George agreed with their colleague in complimenting Quesada 's artwork . Tim <unk> of The Wall Street Journal stated that having Spider @-@ Man makes a deal with the devil @-@ like Mephisto is " the rough equivalent of having Z @-@ movie director Uwe Boll film a studio @-@ funded prequel to Martin Scorsese 's Taxi Driver . 
 Spider @-@ Man creator Stan Lee praised the storyline and what he perceived as the courage its writers and creators showed in so drastically changing a popular and well @-@ established character . Lee said changes are needed to keep a series fresh and compared the criticism from fans to the backlash Marvel Comics received when Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson married in the first place . However , in the newspaper strip he pens , he wrote a deliberate parody of the " One More Day " retcon , revealing that it was in fact a bad dream . Peter remains married to Mary Jane in the newspaper strip . 
 In a roundtable review at Newsarama , J. Caleb <unk> agreed that Spider @-@ Man was easier to relate to while young and single , but that retconning the marriage of Spider @-@ Man was unnecessary due to the existence of titles such as Ultimate Spider @-@ Man and Marvel Adventures Spider @-@ Man . He found the story confusing , wondering how this retcon made sense in the larger Marvel Universe as Spider @-@ Man played important roles in New Avengers and " Civil War " . Kevin Huxford claimed , " you can feel editorial mandate dripping from this " and called the story " utterly ridiculous , " while Lucas Siegel criticized Quesada 's decision to have heroic Peter Parker make a " deal with the Devil " for selfish reasons . Richard <unk> felt that the story 's conclusion was a missed opportunity " to add a new layer of guilt to Peter ’ s already rocky life by allowing May to finally have the send off she deserves , " while Troy Brownfield felt that the storyline damaged Marvel continuity and Spider @-@ Man 's decision was " selfish and childish , " not to mention " a big middle finger to the idea of marriage in comics . " He speculated preferable endings to the story before concluding , " As it stands , Peter , MJ , May . . . and the readers . . . all got a raw deal . " A more positive view came from Brandon Thomas , who felt that " One More Day " was " an incredibly well @-@ told story . " He praised the writing , in particular the morally ambiguous decision Peter has to make and the way he and Mary Jane deal with it together , as well as Quesada 's art , which he felt set the tone of " guilt , regret , and despair . " In regards to the change made in Spider @-@ Man canon , he said , " Peter Parker being married really isn ’ t a vital component of the mythos " and that it allowed Marvel to make " big , sweeping changes to bring things slightly more into focus and back on message . " 
 Wizard praised the artwork , specifically the way Quesada differentiated visually between the dark and light tones before and after the retcon . However , they felt " the entire set up and execution just doesn ’ t make sense " and failed to empathize with the characters and their decisions . They criticized the use of magic in a largely science @-@ based book , calling it " the biggest cheat since Dallas . " They also felt that the concept of making Spider @-@ Man more accessible was undermined by the new and unfamiliar characters . 
 In their coverage of the storyline , UK Television 's Channel 4 News also compared the reaction to " One More Day " to that of Dallas , claiming , " This controversial issue of the comic has been flying off the shelves but reaction from readers has been venomous . " Channel 4 speculated that the reason for the storyline was to make the comics more similar to the financially successful films and merchandise . 
 Comic book historian Peter Sanderson criticized the story for using a supernatural element to retcon the marriage and not maturely dealing with the issue of divorce , arguing the writers had forgotten stories where Spider @-@ Man dealt with his causing the death of Uncle Ben , drugs and child abuse . He wrote , " I expect there are people who are professional comics writers and editors , and people who will someday become professional comics writers and editors , who are outraged that Marvel had Spider @-@ Man make a deal with the devil . And these present and future writers and editors will be determined to undo it . We shall see whether it takes twenty years this time , or much less . " He found the story better than the Clone Saga in the respect that it altered an aspect of canon , instead of erasing it entirely . He also criticized the idea of a hero making a deal with one as evil as Mephisto , effectively the devil .

 Marvel posted a sneak peek at the final pages of the first post- " One More Day " issue , Amazing Spider @-@ Man # 546 , and a two @-@ page spread penciled by John Romita , Jr. entitled " Spider @-@ Man : The New Status Quo ! " , which established the new continuity of Spider @-@ Man . The retcon brings back Harry Osborn from the dead ( in this new continuity , instead of having been dead he had been living in Europe for many years ) , and explains that although Spider @-@ Man unmasked himself during the events of the " Civil War " storyline , no one remembers who was behind the mask . Although Quesada would initially take the position that the changes to the timeline did not have to be explained since they were the result of magic , subsequent writers would , in short order , provide detailed , in @-@ continuity explanations for the changes . 
 In 2010 , Quesada wrote a sequel storyline , " One Moment in Time " . This story established that the only actual change Mephisto wrought upon the timeline was allowing a criminal to escape custody , causing a butterfly effect that prevented Peter and Mary @-@ Jane 's marriage as Peter was delayed in reaching the wedding , prompting Peter and MJ to reconsider marriage . The storyline also established that May was saved by Doctor Strange , despite Strange saying during " One More Day " that it was beyond his power to save her , who also worked with Iron Man and Mister Fantastic to create a mass mind @-@ wipe across the globe to protect Peter 's identity , using the Extremis as a dispersal system to simultaneously erase Spider @-@ Man 's identity and establish a ' psychic <unk> ' that prevents anyone from realising that Peter Parker is Spider @-@ Man , regardless of the evidence they might discover , unless Peter is unmasked in front of them .

 = Valley , West Virginia = 
 Valley was a populated place and post office on the South Branch line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the U.S. state of West Virginia . It was centered near the intersection of West Sioux Lane and Depot Valley Road , now located within the present @-@ day corporate boundaries of Romney . Valley developed in 1884 following the completion of the South Branch line when the rail line 's original southern terminus and corresponding Romney Depot were built there . The United States Post Office Department established a post office at Valley on May 19 , 1928 , remaining in operation until its disestablishment on June 15 , 1937 . Following the closure of Valley 's post office , its mail was routed through the post office in Romney . 
 = = History = = 
 The land upon which Valley later developed was originally part of the South Branch Survey of Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron 's Northern Neck Proprietary . The South Branch Survey extended from the north end of The Trough to the confluence of the north and south branches of the Potomac River . Lord Fairfax originally planned to maintain the South Branch Survey as his personal manor , but later commissioned James Genn to survey the South Branch Potomac River lowlands for sale and lease in 1748 , with land lots ranging in size from 300 acres ( 120 ha ) to 400 acres ( 160 ha ) . Valley was located within the northern section of Lot Number 17 of the South Branch Survey , which Lord Fairfax granted to Samuel Earle in 1749 . Earle was a gentleman from Frederick County , Virginia . 
 By 1778 , Isaac Parsons ( 1752 – 96 ) was in ownership of Lot Number 17 . The parcel was later resurveyed for David Hunter by surveyor John Mitchel on April 17 , 1788 . Lot Number 17 was bound to the west by the Yellow Banks and the South Branch Potomac River below , to the north by Lot Number 20 , and to the south by Lot Number 16 . Most of the western area of the present @-@ day corporate boundaries of Romney were located within Lot Number 17 . Lot Number 17 's eastern boundary stretched between the present @-@ day <unk> @-@ Vale and Wirgman Hill neighborhoods of Romney . The location of Valley was not included in surveyor John Mitchel 's plan for Romney dated June 30 , 1790 , and the forested lands of Depot Valley remained undeveloped into the 19th century . 
 In 1883 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad agreed to complete the South Branch Railway Company 's planned rail line between Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 's main line and Romney . Construction of the rail line began immediately . Completed in 1884 , it spanned a length of 16 @.@ 29 miles ( 26 @.@ 22 km ) . The original southern terminus of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 's South Branch line and the Romney Depot were built at the southern end of Depot Valley , around which Valley developed . The South Branch line formally opened for traffic on September 1 , 1884 . It was at this time that Depot Valley received its name from the Romney Depot . The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad continued to operate the South Branch line and later acquired the property outright by deed on November 20 , 1912 . 
 The arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Romney Depot to Depot Valley brought residential development on the hilltops to the west and east of Valley . On September 27 , 1911 , George Edward Harmison ( 1863 – 1916 ) conducted a public auction of Valley View farm 's fields atop Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River . The land was located atop the hill to the west of Valley . Harmison subdivided the fields into lots , and the planned development was known as the Valley View Addition to Romney . Harmison sold 21 of the land lots at the auction , and several lots were sold privately . A free lot was given to J. H. Newhouse , and Harmison set aside two lots on a bluff for the site of a future hospital , which he planned to deed to any entity willing to build one . 
 As Romney Depot 's passenger and freight services expanded and a populated place continued to develop around the depot , the need for a post office began to grow . On February 6 , 1928 , a " location form " was submitted to the United States Post Office Department suggesting that the Valley post office be located at Romney Depot in Depot Valley . The form noted the post office at Valley would be located a mere 1 @.@ 75 miles ( 2 @.@ 82 km ) northeast of the Vanderlip post office along the South Branch line . The United States Post Office Department established the post office at Valley on May 19 , 1928 . The post office at Valley was disestablished on June 15 , 1937 , and its mail was afterward routed to the post office at Romney . 
 Valley was included in a transportation map of Hampshire County compiled by John R. Ice in his New Descriptive Atlas of West Virginia published by Clarksburg Publishing Company in 1933 . 
 Beginning with the arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 's South Branch line to Romney in the 1880s , a passenger train conducted three trips daily ( morning , noon , and evening ) from the Romney Depot at Valley to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 's main line . During the 1930s , passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline , and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter . A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind , arriving at Romney Depot in Valley in the fall , and departing in the spring to take the students home . The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind departed Romney Depot in the spring of 1941 . Freight operations from Romney Depot later ceased , and the station was closed and demolished soon after . 
 In 1972 , the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was merged into the Chessie System , which planned to close and abandon the South Branch line . The Romney spur through Depot Valley remained in service and was illustrated by the United States Geological Survey on its 1973 Romney Quadrangle topographic map . On October 11 , 1978 , the Chessie System transferred ownership of the South Branch line to the South Branch Valley Railroad , which in turn was owned and operated by the West Virginia State Rail Authority . During this transition , the Romney spur of the South Branch Valley Railroad was abandoned , after which all rail and commercial activity at Valley ceased .

She was the Royal Navy 's second @-@ to @-@ last pre @-@ dreadnought battleship to be built , followed by her sister ship , Lord Nelson . She was assigned to the Channel Fleet when World War I began in 1914 . The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Sea with Lord Nelson in early 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign . She made a number of bombardments against Turkish fortifications and in support of British troops . Agamemnon remained in the Mediterranean after the conclusion of that campaign to prevent the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser Breslau from breaking out into the Mediterranean . Agamemnon shot down the German Zeppelin <unk> during a bombing mission over Salonica in 1916 . On 30 October 1918 , the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on board the ship while she was anchored at Lemnos in the northern Aegean Sea . She was converted to a radio @-@ controlled target ship following her return to the United Kingdom in March 1919 and began service in 1921 .

She was laid down on 15 May 1905 and launched on 23 June 1906 before the dockyards themselves were finished . Her completion was greatly delayed by labour troubles and by the diversion of the 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns intended for her to expedite completion of HMS Dreadnought , and she was not finally completed until June 1908 , six months before her sister Lord Nelson . 
 Agamemnon displaced 17 @,@ 683 long tons ( 17 @,@ 967 t ) at deep load as built , with a length of 443 feet 6 inches ( 135 @.@ 2 m ) , a beam of 79 feet 6 inches ( 24 @.@ 2 m ) and a draft of 26 feet 9 inches ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . She was powered by two inverted vertical triple expansion four @-@ cylinder steam engines , which developed a total of 16 @,@ 750 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 490 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 The ship was armed with four BL 12 @-@ inch Mk X guns arranged in two twin gun turrets , one each fore and aft . Her secondary armament consisted of ten BL 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch Mk XI guns , in twin gun turrets on each corner of the superstructure , and a single gun turret between them , plus 24 QF 12 @-@ pounder 18 cwt guns . She also mounted five submerged 17 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) torpedo tubes for which 23 torpedoes were stowed aboard . 
 Agamemnon had an armour belt at her waterline that was 12 inches ( 305 mm ) thick , as were the faces and sides of her gun turrets . 
 = = Service = = 
 HMS Agamemnon commissioned on 25 June 1908 at Chatham Dockyard for service in the Nore Division of the Home Fleet . On 11 February 1911 , she grazed an uncharted rock in the harbour at Ferrol , Spain , and damaged her bottom . She was temporarily attached in September 1913 to the 4th Battle Squadron . 
 After the First World War began in August 1914 , Agamemnon was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron in the Channel Fleet and was based at Portland . With other ships , she covered the safe transport of the British Expeditionary Force , under the command of Sir John French , to France . On 14 November 1914 she transferred to Sheerness to guard the English coast against the possibility of a German invasion . She returned to Portland on 30 December 1914 and was employed in the defence of the southern ports of England and patrols of the English Channel until February 1915 . 
 = = = Dardanelles campaign , 1915 – 16 = = = 
 In February 1915 , Agamemnon was ordered to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign . She departed Portland on 9 February , and joined the British Dardanelles Squadron at Mudros 10 days later . That was the second day of the opening bombardment of the Ottoman Turkish forts guarding the entrance to the Dardanelles and the ship immediately joined the attack . She also took part in the subsequent bombardment of the inner forts later in February . Agamemnon was hit by seven 240 @-@ millimetre ( 9 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ) shells in ten minutes on 25 February and was holed above the waterline , suffering three dead . 
 She supported the small amphibious landings of 4 March and participated in another bombardment on 6 March 1915 . She came under heavy fire from Fort Hamidieh on 7 March , taking eight hits from large @-@ calibre shells ; one of them , allegedly a 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) round , blew a large hole in her quarterdeck and wrecked the wardroom and the gunroom . She also took several hits by light shells that day , and , although she suffered damage to her superstructure , her fighting and steaming capabilities were not seriously impaired . 
 The ship also participated in the main attack on the Dardanelles forts on 18 March . This time a 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) howitzer battery opened fire on Agamemnon and hit her 12 times in 25 minutes ; five of the howitzer shells hit her armour and did no damage , but the seven that hit outside her armour protection did considerable structural damage and temporarily put one of her 12 @-@ inch ( 305 @-@ mm ) guns out of action . 
 On 25 April , Agamemnon supported the main landings as part of the 5th Squadron , and after that she patrolled to protect Allied minesweeping and <unk> vessels operating in the Dardanelles . In action against Ottoman field batteries , she took two hits between 28 April and 30 April , and she provided fire support for Allied troops during a Turkish counterattack on 1 May . Agamemnon bombarded Ottoman artillery batteries on 6 May prior to the Second Battle of Krithia . 
 Agamemnon was withdrawn to Malta later in May to undergo a refit and returned to the Dardanelles in June . On 2 December , the ship joined the protected cruiser Endymion and monitor M33 in bombarding the Kavak bridge , destroying several spans of it and interdicting Ottoman communications to the Gallipoli Peninsula . 
 = = = Mediterranean operations , 1916 – 18 = = = 
 With the end of the Dardanelles Campaign in January 1916 , British naval forces in the area were reorganized , and Agamemnon became part of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron , which was re @-@ designated the Aegean Squadron in August 1917 . Under both names , the squadron was dispersed throughout the area to protect Allied @-@ held islands , support the British Army at Salonika , and guard against any attempted breakout from the Dardanelles by the German battlecruiser Goeben and light cruiser Breslau . Agamemnon spent the remainder of the war based at Salonika and Mudros , alternating between the two bases with her sister Lord Nelson ; Agamemnon was based mostly at Mudros , Lord Nelson mostly at Salonika . While carrying out these duties , Agamemnon damaged the German Zeppelin <unk> on 5 May at Salonika with a shell from a 12 @-@ pounder and forced it to crash @-@ land . 
 Of all the responsibilities given the two ships , the most important was to guard the Eastern Mediterranean against a breakout by Goeben , but when Goeben and Breslau finally made their breakout attempt on 20 January 1918 , Lord Nelson was away at Salonika and Agamemnon could not get steam up to depart Mudros in time to participate in the resulting Battle of Imbros . After both German ships struck mines , Breslau sank and Goeben returned to the Dardanelles before Agamemnon could arrive on the scene . 
 Agamemnon underwent a refit at Malta in 1918 . On 30 October the Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on board Agamemnon while she was anchored at Lemnos in the northern Aegean Sea .

 Agamemnon was part of the British squadron that went to Constantinople in November 1918 following the armistice . She returned to the United Kingdom in March 1919 , where she paid off at Chatham Dockyard and went into reserve on 20 March . 
 In September 1918 , the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Grand Fleet , Admiral David Beatty , had called for a large target to be provided which would allow realistic gunnery practice for the battleships of the Grand Fleet , which had seen little action since the Battle of Jutland in 1916 . Tests against armour plate in 1919 demonstrated that firing 15 @-@ inch ( 381 @-@ mm ) guns at any pre @-@ dreadnought would sink her quickly , but the use of a pre @-@ dreadnought for target practice and tests by guns of 6 @-@ inch calibre ( 152 @-@ mm ) or smaller seemed practical . At first the pre @-@ dreadnought Hibernia was suggested for target duties , but ultimately Agamemnon became available and was selected instead . 
 She was modified at Chatham Dockyard for use as a target ship between 6 December 1920 and 8 April 1921 . The ship was rewired for radio control and stripped ; the 12 @-@ inch turrets remained aboard , but all of her guns and their equipment were removed , as were her torpedo equipment , flying deck , sea cabins , main derrick and boat equipment , lower conning tower , masts and yards , most of her crew amenities , and other unnecessary equipment . Unnecessary hatches , coamings , scuttles , and lifts were removed and plated over , and she was ballasted differently than she had been as a battleship . It was not intended to sink her , so she was assigned a crew of 153 to maintain and operate her when she was not under fire . 
 Agamemnon 's first target service took place before her modifications were completed . On 19 March 1921 , she was exposed to a cloud of poisonous gas to determine the effect of gas on a battleship . It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings , but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained . On 21 September , she was subjected to machine @-@ gun fire by strafing aircraft . These trials showed that such strafing could harass a battleship , but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities , and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel . 
 Agamemnon also was used to test the vulnerability of battleships to 6 @-@ inch ( 152 @-@ mm ) , 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 140 @-@ mm ) , and 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 @-@ mm ) rounds fired at her by ships such as the battlecruisers Renown and Repulse while she maneuvered under radio control . These tests showed that ships protected as well as Agamemnon , such as the later dreadnoughts , would suffer damage to their upper works if struck by such shells , but would not have their steaming or fighting capability seriously impaired even by numerous smaller @-@ caliber hits . 
 = = Disposal = = 
 Agamemnon was relieved as target ship by the dreadnought Centurion in December 1926 . By then the last British pre @-@ dreadnought battleship in existence , she was sold to J Cashmore of Newport , South Wales on 24 January 1927 for scrap , and departed Portsmouth Dockyard on 1 March to be broken up at Newport . 
 = Ted Kennedy ( ice hockey ) = 
 Theodore Samuel " Teeder " Kennedy ( December 12 , 1925 – August 14 , 2009 ) was a professional ice hockey centre who played his entire career with the Toronto Maple Leafs from 1942 to 1957 and was captain for eight seasons . He was the first player in NHL history to win five Stanley Cups and is the last Maple Leaf to win the Hart Trophy for most valuable player . He was an essential contributor to the Maple Leafs becoming what many consider as the National Hockey League 's first dynasty . He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966 . He has been called the quintessential Maple Leaf and by some the greatest player in the team 's history . 
 Kennedy was raised in the small Ontario town of Humberstone , now Port Colborne . Kennedy was born just eleven days after his father was killed in a hunting accident . His mother , left alone to raise four children , took a job at the local hockey arena which became Kennedy 's second home . After a stellar junior hockey career , Kennedy first came to the attention of the Montreal Canadiens and attended their training camp while still in high school . However , after some disappointing experiences with Montreal management he signed shortly afterward with the Maple Leafs . 
 Although young , Kennedy was successful with Toronto from the start . In his first season , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished second on the team in scoring and then in his sophomore year was considered the star of Toronto 's upset of the record @-@ breaking Montreal Canadiens of 1944 – 45 . He would establish himself as the leader of the team and became captain in 1948 . Although not the best skater in the league , Kennedy was a fierce fore @-@ checker and skilled playmaker . Kennedy would be a perfect fit into coach Hap Day 's emphasis on defense and positional play . He gained a reputation for scoring the important goal and excelling in the playoffs . Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs ' all @-@ time record for career points in Stanley Cup finals and is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal . A Sports Illustrated poll of hockey experts in 1998 rated Kennedy as having the best face @-@ off skills in the history of the NHL . 
 = = Youth = = 
 Ted " Teeder " Kennedy was born December 12 , 1925 , in the small village of Humberstone , Ontario , which in 1970 was amalgamated into the city of Port Colborne . Ted 's father , Gordon Kennedy , was killed in a hunting accident eleven days before he was born and his mother , Margaret , was left to raise a family of four children . To supplement her income she took a job selling confectioneries at a local hockey arena which became young Ted 's second home . When Ted was seven years old a family friend took him to Toronto to see the first two games of the 1932 Stanley Cup finals and from watching those games Maple Leaf right winger Charlie Conacher became his childhood hero . He wore Conacher 's No.9 throughout his minor hockey career . In Port Colborne , Kennedy was childhood friends with Elmer <unk> , who would find fame as a choir conductor and Don <unk> who would find infamy when he was banned for life by the NHL for gambling while playing with the Boston Bruins in 1948 . 
 Kennedy played with the Port Colborne Lions in the Ontario Minor Hockey Association as a bantam , midget and juvenile . His nickname " Teeder " is a short form of his real name which was used by other neighbourhood boys because they could not pronounce " Theodore " and was overheard by a local reporter with the Welland Tribune . During Kennedy 's NHL years , newspapers often used the spelling " Teeter " . Kennedy was captain of the midget Port Colborne Lions when they won the <unk> Championship in 1941 . The Toronto Star described the 15 @-@ year @-@ old Kennedy as a " shifty <unk> " who had " paced the Lions to victory , scoring five goals , two of which were solo efforts . " On May 7 , 1941 , at a banquet in Port Colborne honouring the championship team , one of the speakers was Hap Day , coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs . He spoke to the players , advising them that " keen desire " and " hard work " was required to get to the top in hockey as in any job in life and that hockey salaries were " equal to other leading professions " . Day then presented members of the team with jackets bearing the championship crest . In only two years , Kennedy would be playing for Hap Day 's Toronto Maple Leafs . 
 The next season Kennedy 's juvenile team made it to the finals . During the season , Kennedy had scored seven goals in one game and six in another and it was efforts such as those which were attracting the attention of professional hockey people . The first team to approach Kennedy was the NHL 's Montreal Canadiens , although for Kennedy " It was a boyhood dream to play for Toronto . " Dinty Moore , also of Port Colborne , brought Kennedy to the attention Montreal General Manager Tommy Gorman and Kennedy was put on their negotiation list . In the fall of 1942 , Montreal contacted the sixteen @-@ year @-@ old about joining the Canadiens . Kennedy 's mother was wary of a career in hockey for her son as he was also headed towards studying business at the University of Western Ontario . She agreed to let her son attend the training camp when Montreal scout Dinty Moore assured her Ted would receive a good education at Montreal 's prestigious Lower Canada College for which they would cover the cost . Upon arriving in Montreal , foreshadowing future troubles , Kennedy discovered there was no one from the Canadiens to greet him at the train . The teenager was left to his own devices to check into a hotel and make his way around the new city . Then later , as he tried to combine hockey and school , he became concerned his studies were suffering and approached Canadien management to ask if they could find him accommodation closer to the school . He felt they were unresponsive and he soon became disillusioned with the experience in Montreal . After three weeks in Montreal he was feeling homesick and upon completing spring training with the Montreal Royals , he returned to Port Colborne in mid @-@ November . 
 Back home , Kennedy played with the Port Colborne Sailors of the OHA Sr. league for the 1942 – 43 hockey season . The Port Colborne coach was former NHL star and Hall of Fame inductee Nels Stewart who had been hired in November . Stewart became a mentor to Kennedy , working on his playmaking skills . Kennedy credits Stewart with teaching him how to " operate in front of the net " . Kennedy finished the season second in the league , only one point behind scoring champion , Dillon Brady of Hamilton . It was during this time that Kennedy would have debuted as a player at Maple Leaf Gardens . OHA senior teams played at the Gardens on Friday evenings and this included Kennedy and the Port Colborne Sailors . At the end of the season , in early February 1943 , in spite of his having abandoned the Royals , Montreal scout Gus Ogilvie was sent to induce Kennedy to sign a contract with the promise that if he signed he would finish the season with the Canadiens in the NHL . Concerned about his treatment in Montreal , he declined , despite being warned by Ogilvie , " Well , you know , Ted , if you turn pro , it will have to be with the Canadiens . " Kennedy now thought his dreams of playing in the NHL were over . However , Nels Stewart believed in Kennedy , considering him " a coming great " , and recommended him to the Toronto Maple Leafs . Shortly thereafter , Kennedy was called out of his grade 11 Latin class to the Principal 's office . Kennedy , the high school student , was at first worried about what he may have done wrong , but it turned out to be a phone call from Nels Stewart . Stewart had arranged a meeting with General Manager of the Leafs Frank Selke and Kennedy would have to travel immediately to Toronto . Unlike Montreal , the Maple Leafs had someone there to meet Kennedy when he got off the train . Kennedy signed a contract that evening .

 = = = Style of play = = = 
 Although Kennedy was not a gifted skater , he compensated with a fierce determination and tireless hard work . Among modern era players his style of play has been compared to Bobby Clarke and Jarome Iginla . Line @-@ mate Howie Meeker said that while he was a much better skater than Kennedy , " He went from A to B just as fast I could because he went through people " [ sic ] . Kennedy would prove to be a perfect fit into coach Hap Day 's coaching style of emphasizing defense , positional hockey and physical play . He brought to the Leafs a classy , humble leadership and the knack for scoring goals when they were most needed . He would fight for every inch of ice and was difficult to separate from the puck . He was also known for his agility , stick @-@ handling , playmaking , passing skills and physical toughness . 
 Dick Irvin once compared the styles of Syl Apps , previous captain of the Leafs , to Kennedy in how the two centres used their wingers . " Apps used to hit the defense at top speed and Gordie <unk> would come along and pick up the garbage " , said Irvin . Whereas Kennedy would " go into the corners and get the puck out to their wings . " Hap Day had said he could see Nels Stewart 's influence on Kennedy . Like Stewart , Kennedy had a more upright lie on his hockey stick which kept the puck closer to his feet . Kennedy was also widely believed to be the best faceoff man in hockey and would seldom lose an important faceoff . Along with his regular shift , he would also play a role on the penalty kill . 
 = = = Making the team = = = 
 On March 3 , 1943 , Kennedy signed a professional contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs , but management of the Leafs still wished to see Kennedy playing in an NHL game . Late in the 1942 – 43 season , they received permission from Kennedy 's mother to take him out of school so he could accompany them on a road trip . He played in two of the final three games of the regular season , but did not continue with them into the playoffs . Making his NHL debut March 7 , 1943 , against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden , he was put on the Leafs ' third line on rightwing , instead of his customary centre position , on a line with Bud Poile and Gaye Stewart . He was told by coach Hap Day to simply " stay with your check and keep him from scoring . " Kennedy 's line scored three goals and he picked up one assist in a 5 – 5 tie . He then picked another assist in the next game in Boston . Kennedy had impressed the Leaf coaches , but his rights were still " officially " owned by the Montreal Canadiens . 
 Toronto first tried to buy his rights from Montreal , but a trade was arranged exchanging Kennedy for Frank Eddolls . Toronto newspapers of the day in reporting the trade described the 17 @-@ year @-@ old Kennedy as " a rangy youngster whose record in the OHA is exceptionally good " , that he was " highly recommended by other hockey men " and was a " high @-@ scoring right @-@ winger " . Nevertheless , interim manager Frank Selke had made the trade while Conn Smythe , owner of the Leafs , was away in service in World War II and Eddolls was one of his prized prospects . Smythe was furious when he discovered the trade , creating a rift between the two which ultimately led Selke to leave Toronto to manage the Canadiens . Ironically , Kennedy would eventually prove to be Smythe 's favourite player and he would come to call Kennedy " the greatest competitor in hockey " . Looking back , some hockey pundits have called the trade the best the Toronto Maple Leafs have ever made . In 2001 , Sports Illustrated writer and Montreal native , Michael Farber , included the Kennedy trade for Eddolls as one of " the five darkest days " in Montreal Canadiens ' history . 
 Kennedy played full @-@ time with the Leafs for the first time in the 1943 – 44 season . Although the Leafs had won the Stanley Cup in 1942 , at the time of Kennedy 's arrival the Leafs were a team decimated by the loss of some of its best players to the war effort . Andy Lytle , Sports Editor of The Toronto Star , wrote of the Leaf team eliminated from the previous season 's playoffs , " I do not suppose that Toronto was so weakly represented in the N.H.L. playoffs since the club originated . " During training camp , Kennedy read in a newspaper interview of Coach Hap Day speaking about the best new prospects on the Leafs , but he had failed to mention Kennedy . This served to fire up Kennedy to give an even greater effort towards making the team . Toronto 's first pre @-@ season exhibition game was against the St. Catharine Saints , a senior team now being coached by Kennedy 's former junior coach Nels Stewart . After the game , Kennedy approached Stewart for advice , because he was disappointed he had not scored in the game . Stewart , who was the all @-@ time NHL goal scoring leader until Maurice Richard overtook him in the 1952 – 53 season , advised when facing the goaltender to " either draw him out , or pick the corner . " 
 Kennedy began the season playing rightwing . Then , in mid @-@ December , Leaf centre Mel Hill fractured his ankle and was lost from the team . This gave Kennedy his first opportunity to play regularly at the centre position where he would remain for most of his career . In a January 8 game at Maple Leaf Gardens against the Boston Bruins , the mayor of Port Colborne presented Kennedy and Don <unk> with gold watches on behalf of his town 's citizens . Kennedy would finish the season as the team 's second best goal @-@ scorer with 26 and was fourth in points . He was just 18 years old . In the playoffs , Toronto faced the powerful Montreal Canadiens . Although Toronto won the first game 3 – 1 , they were then swept in the next four and eliminated from the playoffs . The Toronto Daily Star said of Kennedy 's rookie season , " For our money the best rookie of the year though playing with one of the weakest lines in N.H.L. history . " Kennedy was ineligible for the rookie @-@ of @-@ the @-@ year award because of the two games he played with the Leafs at the end of the 1942 – 43 season . 
 = = = The first Stanley Cup and the great upset = = = 
 In only his second NHL season , Kennedy finished the 1944 – 45 regular season leading the team in goals and points with 29 goals and 25 assists . In the last game of the season against the New York Rangers , Kennedy 's line @-@ mates fed him pass after pass attempting to get him to 30 goals . The Maple Leafs finished in third place and would face the Montreal Canadiens in the opening round of the playoffs . The Montreal Canadiens of 1944 – 45 were a record @-@ breaking , powerhouse hockey team . Going into the playoffs the coach of Montreal , Dick Irvin , declared them as the greatest team to have ever played in the NHL . The Montreal club had the top three point leaders in the league , placed 5 of the 6 positions on the First All @-@ Star team , Maurice Richard had scored his famous 50 goals in 50 games , Montreal had finished 28 points ahead of Toronto and scored almost a goal @-@ per @-@ game more . As of 2009 , Montreal 's regular season winning percentage for 1944 – 45 is the fifth highest in NHL history and the year previously they had achieved the second highest in history and won the Stanley Cup . The Leafs were given little chance of winning the series . 
 As with all NHL playoff series of the era , the winner would be the first team to win four games of a best @-@ of @-@ seven . Going into the series , Hap Day made a critical decision to predominantly play only two lines of his best players to compensate for the Canadiens ' depth in talent . The first game was in Montreal and no goals were scored for the first two periods . In the third period , with just twenty @-@ two seconds remaining and everyone anticipating overtime , Ted Kennedy banked a backhand shot off the goalpost which then rebounded off goaltender Bill Durnan 's pads and into the net to win the game 1 – 0 . The goal shocked the Montreal team , especially as the famed " Punch Line " had been held scoreless . In the second game , also in Montreal , Kennedy struck again only four minutes into the first period scoring the all @-@ important first goal to put the Toronto ahead by 1 – 0 . Toronto went on to win the game 3 – 2 and were able to leave Montreal with an unexpected 2 – 0 series lead . Montreal won the next game in Toronto 4 – 1 . In the fourth game in Toronto , Montreal got off to a quick start and led 2 – 0 on goals by Elmer Lach and Richard , his first of the series , before the game was three minutes old . In the second period , Kennedy set up Mel Hill to get Toronto back in the game and the Leafs went on to win in overtime . As Toronto needed only one more victory to win the series , Montreal was facing elimination in game five in Montreal . Maurice Richard finally overcame Leaf checking and scored four goals in an 11 – 3 victory . However , Toronto won the sixth game in Maple Leaf Gardens 3 – 2 to win the series and complete the shocking upset . In the game , Toronto 's Elwyn Morris , a defenceman who had scored only one goal all season , sparked the Leafs when he stole the puck from Montreal defenceman Frank Eddolls to score the first goal of the game . Eddolls was the player traded to Montreal to bring Kennedy to Toronto . This series is considered one of the greatest upsets in NHL history . 
 On completion of the Montreal series , the Globe and Mail said of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Kennedy , " Ted Kennedy 's all @-@ round display was the best individual performance of the six @-@ game set . " The Toronto Star was even more laudatory " There are a few great hockey players in the N.H.L. today . Kennedy is assuredly and emphatically one . " Kennedy said that the 1945 upset of the Canadiens was the peak event of his career . 
 Toronto faced Detroit in the Stanley Cup final . Toronto won the first three games of the series without giving up a goal , as rookie goaltender Frank McCool recorded consecutive shutouts . Toronto then had to ward off a determined Detroit comeback bid , before winning the Stanley Cup in the seventh game . Kennedy had continued with a strong performance against Detroit , scoring the game @-@ winning goal in game 2 , was chosen the first star ( best player ) of game 3 and scored all three goals in a 5 – 3 loss in game 5 . 
 Conn Smythe realized the importance of finding the right line @-@ mates for Kennedy , telling coach Hap Day in September 1945 , " we must get something really rapid to team up with this guy and we 'll be set for a decade with a first rate front line . " Smythe 's first attempt was to acquire future Hockey Hall of Famer Edgar Laprade , at the time a star in senior hockey whose rights were owned by the New York Rangers . A deal could not be made as New York General Manager Lester Patrick was asking for several players in return . 
 After the triumph of the previous season , the 1945 – 46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy . He got off to a slow start , beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill . By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost for the rest of the season due to an injury to his foot , when a Boston Bruin player 's skate dug into his boot . With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs . 
 = = = The NHL 's " first dynasty " = = = 
 On September 19 , 1946 , an informal ceremony was held in which former Leaf great Charlie Conacher presented Ted Kennedy with his No. 9 sweater he had worn during his career . Conacher had been Kennedy 's boyhood hero , but when Kennedy arrived Lorne Carr already wore No.9. Kennedy was initially given No.12 , then switched to No. 10 . When Kennedy heard Carr was retiring , he immediately wrote a letter to Leaf management requesting No.9. His Leaf team @-@ mates had always teased Kennedy about his compulsion , so they contacted Conacher and arranged for the ceremony . Conacher , now working as a broker , explaining why he was willing to take time off work said " He 's a good kid and a great player . You just can 't disappoint a guy like that . " 
 Conn Smythe instituted a major rebuilding campaign for the 1946 – 47 . Gone from the team was Sweeney Schriner , Lorne Carr , Bob Davidson , Mel Hill , Elwin Morris , Babe Pratt , Billy Taylor and new additions were Harry Watson , Jimmy Thomson , Gus <unk> , Garth Boesch , Joe <unk> , Don Metz , Vic Lynn and Howie Meeker . The team was very young , with six rookies in the lineup , and was felt to be two years away from challenging for the championship . However , some of those rookies , such as Boesch and Meeker , had just returned from the war and were more mature than most . As Hap Day observed , " They 'd been through real battles . " 
 Kennedy said that during this period , with all the changes on the team and with players returning from the war he had to " re @-@ establish myself as an NHLer . " Due to Kennedy 's poor start to the previous season , there was some talk around this time whether Kennedy was going to turn out to be just a " wartime flash in the pan " . Many of the players in the NHL during this period failed to stick with their teams once the war ended and the stars returned . However , Kennedy was one of the exceptions and he would quickly become one of the team 's greatest stars and a favourite of the fans . " Come on , Teeder ! " was to become a familiar rallying cry in Maple Leaf Gardens . The cheer , a howl that could be heard throughout the building , was performed by , the otherwise quiet , season ticket @-@ holder John Arnott whenever the Leafs needed a goal . 
 Kennedy became famous across Canada from the radio broadcasts of Foster Hewitt . It was not until the 1952 – 53 season that hockey games were broadcast on television in Canada . 
 Kennedy now centered a line between Howie Meeker and Vic Lynn and they clicked " immediately " . These were the line @-@ mates Smythe had been trying to find for Kennedy since 1945 . Kennedy served as the playmaker between the fast skating and goal scoring of Meeker and Lynn . Meeker had just returned from the war and Lynn had come up from the American league and both were hungry to stay in the NHL . " We were very eager people " , Kennedy recalled . The line soon acquired the nickname the " KLM " line . 
 At the end of the season Kennedy led the Leafs in points and they finished in second place to Montreal . In the first round of the playoffs Toronto faced Detroit . Except for a one @-@ sided 9 – 1 loss in the second game in Detroit , Toronto dominated the series and won in five games . Toronto now faced Montreal for the Stanley Cup . The match up was between the very young Maple Leafs and the veteran Montreal Canadiens who had dominated the NHL for the past four years . After Toronto lost the opening game by a one @-@ sided 6 – 0 , Canadien goaltender Bill Durnan was quoted in a Montreal newspaper as saying , " How did the Maple Leafs manage to get into the playoffs ? " Hap Day used the quote to inspire his team . In the second game , Kennedy opened the scoring at 1 : 12 of the game then assisted on line @-@ mate Lynn 's goal on the next face @-@ off putting the Leafs up 2 – 0 at less than 2 minutes into the game . Toronto went on to win the game 4 – 0 . In game 3 Toronto had built a 3 – 0 lead by halfway through the second , but Montreal battled back to close the gap to 3 – 2 . With Montreal pressing in the dying seconds of the game , Kennedy dug the puck out of a desperate scramble in front of the Toronto goalmouth , carried the puck up ice , then forcing goaltender Durnan to go down , he put the puck behind him to clinch the game . Toronto won game 4 in overtime 2 – 1 while the Canadiens won game 5 in Montreal 3 – 1 . Kennedy 's line came up with their best game of the series in game 6 . Montreal had taken an early two @-@ goal lead and appeared to be heading for a seventh game in Montreal . In the second period , Lynn tied the game with assists from Kennedy and Meeker . Then in the third with less than six minutes to go in the game Kennedy scored and Toronto held on to win the Stanley Cup . 
 Kennedy was voted the star in two of Toronto 's wins in Montreal , scoring the winning goal in both , and was described as the most determined player in the playoffs . He still holds the NHL all @-@ time record as the youngest player to score a Stanley Cup winning goal . Kennedy finished the playoffs leading the Leafs in points and was second overall . However , despite winning the Stanley Cup the Toronto Maple Leafs did not place a single player on either the first or second All @-@ Star teams .

 The 1947 – 48 season brought Max Bentley to Toronto from Chicago in what has been called the biggest trade in NHL history as the Leafs gave up five regular players for the league 's scoring leader . <unk> the depth of the team at centre , Bentley played on the team 's third line , behind Apps and Kennedy . Decades later , Hap Day argued that this team was the strongest NHL team ever and Globe and Mail reporter Dick Beddoes also stirred up controversy by saying Wayne Gretzky would have been relegated to the fourth line on this Leaf team . 
 The Leafs finished in first place at the end of the regular season . Kennedy had finished the regular season third in points on the team behind the other two star centers Apps and Bentley , but it was Kennedy who was to dominate the playoffs . In the first round Toronto played Boston and eliminated the Bruins in five games . Kennedy set up the tying goal which led to an overtime win in game 1 and scored four times in the second game . But it was in the fifth and deciding for which he received greatest praise for his fore @-@ checking tenacity and clutch goalscoring . First , with Toronto down 2 – 1 and the Bruins having the better of the play , he out @-@ fought two Boston players for possession to get the puck to Bentley who in turn set up Lynn for the tying goal . Then later , Kennedy was carrying the puck into the Boston end . He passed to Meeker , who returned the pass , Kennedy faked once , moved in front of the net , forced goaltender <unk> to go down , then lifted the puck over him . In the finals , Toronto swept Montreal in four straight games to win the Stanley Cup . Kennedy scored twice in the Cup @-@ winning game and finished leading all players in the playoffs in points with eight goals and five assists and he was also not given a single penalty in the entire playoffs . His checking and work in the corners has been credited as critical to the victory . 
 On the afternoon of Thursday , April 16 , 1948 , the Leaf players were greeted by thousands of Toronto fans as they got off the train from Detroit . They then rode open cars through a cascade of multi @-@ coloured paper and ticket tape through Toronto 's business district to arrive at a civic reception at City Hall . Speaking to the huge crowd , Conn Smythe announced that Kennedy would be succeeding Syl Apps as captain who was retiring . 
 In the off @-@ season , on Saturday , June 12 , 1948 , Kennedy married Doreen Dent of Toronto in Knox College Chapel in Toronto . 
 The Leafs struggled early in the 1948 – 49 season having lost Apps and Nick Metz to retirement , and then Kennedy for a month and Cal Gardner for two months due to injuries . By the end of January , Toronto was only one point ahead of the last place New York Rangers who had even played two fewer games than Toronto . Kennedy 's return to the team in mid @-@ January provided the needed spark to pull the Leafs out of their prolonged slump . Although finishing the regular season with a losing record of 23 wins 25 losses and 12 ties , they were able to place fourth , which was the last position qualifying for the playoffs . However , in the first round of the playoffs they defeated Boston in five games . Kennedy had scored the game @-@ winning goal which put Toronto up 3 – 0 in games . Toronto then faced the first @-@ place Detroit Red Wings . During the season , Detroit General Manager Jack Adams said of the Red Wings , " This is the greatest team in my 22 seasons here . " However , Toronto swept the Red Wings in four straight games to win their third consecutive Stanley Cup . Kennedy finished the playoffs with two goals and six assists to lead the Leafs in points and was second only to Detroit 's Gordie Howe overall . 
 This was the first time a National Hockey League team had won three Cups in a row and had not been accomplished since the Ottawa Silver Seven in the pre @-@ NHL era , 44 years before . The Leafs had also won 9 consecutive Stanley Cup final games dating back to April 19 , 1947 ( initial cup won on this date , with the following two wins being finals sweeps ) . This Toronto Maple Leafs team is distinguished as the first dynasty in the history of the NHL .

 At the beginning of the 1949 – 50 , Conn Smythe liked the Leafs ' chances for continued success , saying , " We 'll be hard to keep away from a fourth Stanley Cup , " but as the season progressed many hockey people felt Detroit would end the Leafs ' Stanley Cup streak . By the end of the season , Toronto had finished in third and Kennedy finished second on the Leafs in points . 
 The 1950 playoffs were overshadowed by an on @-@ ice mishap in the opening game between Toronto and Detroit , in which the Red Wings ' young star player , Gordie Howe , was seriously injured . Late in the game with Toronto leading 4 – 0 , Kennedy stole the puck from Detroit defenseman Jack Stewart and was carrying it down the left wing about six feet from the boards into the Detroit end of the rink . Stewart was pursuing him from behind and Howe was coming in fast from the side to try to cut him off . Kennedy saw Howe coming at the last moment , and was able to dodge Howe 's check while passing the puck to Sid Smith , but Howe could not stop and crashed head @-@ first into the boards , with Stewart falling on top of him . Howe sustained a concussion , facial fractures , and a lacerated right eyeball , and doctors had to perform emergency procedures on him at the hospital to save his life . Detroit coach Tommy Ivan and general manager Jack Adams accused Kennedy of deliberately butt @-@ ending Howe . Kennedy had not been assessed a penalty on the play . After the game Kennedy said , " I don 't know how he got it . I avoided his check along the boards and didn 't feel anything hit me , although he may have struck my stick . " 
 NHL President Clarence Campbell was at the game and was seated near where the incident occurred . After receiving a report from the game 's officials , Campbell called a news conference and said the injury was not Kennedy 's fault . Campbell also publicly rebuked Ivan for his accusation , saying , " That is a pretty serious business and a very vicious charge . " It was also argued that since Kennedy was a right @-@ handed shot , the butt @-@ end of his stick would have been towards the boards and away from Howe . Sportswriter Ted Reeve of the Toronto Telegram quipped , " How would a right handed stickhandler going down the left boards give anyone a butt end ? Unless he wanted to lift the snappers out of someone in the rail seats . " Howe was lost from the playoffs , but the incident influenced the momentum of the series . Detroit won the second game of the series 3 – 1 , a violent and fight @-@ filled affair which included a stick @-@ swinging incident between the Leafs ' Jimmy Thomson and Detroit 's Leo Reise and a fight between Kennedy and Ted Lindsay . After the game , Campbell threatened the players with fines if the violent play continued , and both teams continued to play hockey for the remainder of the series . However , Detroit was now determined to " win the series for Gordie " and defeated the Leafs in seven strongly @-@ contested games to eliminate them from the playoffs , going on to win the Stanley Cup . 
 In recovery from his hospital bed , Howe said , " Ted is too good a player to deliberately injure another player . " Then , years later , while still believing that he had been hit by Kennedy 's stick , Howe reiterated that there was no intent to injure on Kennedy 's part and considered his injuries self @-@ inflicted . However , the incident still continues at times to be described as a deliberate act by Kennedy . In 2001 , the The Sporting News ran an article on the 30 toughest players in the NHL . In referring to Howe 's injury , the incident was described " he was knocked heavily into the boards by Toronto 's Teeder Kennedy " . 
 = = = The Final Cup = = = 
 Except for being left with a lifelong facial tick , Howe made a full recovery and for the 1950 – 51 season as he finished the season leading the league in points . The Maple Leafs finished in second place behind Detroit . Kennedy finished second on the team in points behind Bentley and tied with Howe for the league lead in assists with 43 . In the first round of the playoffs Montreal upset Detroit and Toronto defeated Boston . 
 The Stanley Cup final between Montreal and Toronto went five games , but is remarkable as each game required overtime to be decided . In the third game , with the series tied at one game a piece , Kennedy both saved the game for the Leafs and won it . First , he prevented a goal by clearing a puck that was heading into the Toronto net , then , just fifty seconds later at the other end of the rink , he intercepted a clear @-@ out pass from Montreal 's Calum MacKay and scored to win the game . The fourth game was won by Toronto to lead the series 3 – 1 . 
 It was in the next game of the series which Leaf defenceman Bill Barilko scored one of the most famous goals in NHL history with a goal in overtime to win the Stanley Cup . However , without Kennedy 's face @-@ off skills Barilko 's goal would never have occurred . Montreal had been leading late in the game 2 – 1 and it appeared that the teams would be playing a sixth game in Montreal . With just 39 seconds remaining in the game , Toronto was able to get a faceoff in the Montreal end . Toronto coach Joe Primeau had pulled the goaltender so they could have six skaters . Primeau had the option of changing his players , but decided to leave Kennedy out to take the faceoff against Canadien Billy Reay . Kennedy 's plan on the faceoff was to get the puck to Max Bentley , who was stationed at the point . Then Montreal coach Dick Irvin decided to switch and have his best forwards , the Punch Line , out for this critical faceoff . Kennedy would be facing Lach instead . Kennedy later recalled he was relieved at the switch as he had trouble with Reay on faceoffs , but when Lach came out he felt " I had a chance , " Kennedy won the faceoff from Lach , got the puck to Bentley and from the ensuing scramble around the net Tod Sloan tied the game . The goal dispirited the Montreal team and led to Barilko 's famed overtime goal which won another Stanley Cup for the Leafs . 
 Following the 1951 cup , Kennedy said that without the Howe incident of the previous season , " we probably would have been the first team to win 5 in a row . " 
 = = = Latter years = = = 
 1950 – 51 season would be Kennedy 's last Stanley Cup . In the years following until Kennedy 's retirement in 1957 the Leafs would either finish out of the playoffs or lose in the first round . However , Kennedy continued to play productive hockey . The Leafs never missed the playoffs in the years Kennedy played a full season . 
 On October 13 , 1951 , the Leafs and the Chicago Black Hawks played an afternoon exhibition of hockey , prior to their regularly scheduled evening game , for Princess Elizabeth , the future Queen Elizabeth II , during her visit to Canada . It was captain Teeder Kennedy , representing the players , who greeted the Princess at the game . Kennedy said it was a thrilling moment and recalled thinking at the time , " Here 's a kid from the little village of Humberstone , Ontario being presented to the Queen . " The 1951 – 52 season was dominated by Gordie Howe and the Red Wings as they finished the regular season in first and then swept third place Toronto in the first round of the playoffs and Montreal in second round without losing a single game . 
 In a game in Boston in January of the 1952 – 53 season Kennedy suffered a separated shoulder in a scuffle with Milt Schmidt of the Bruins and underwent surgery . Originally thought lost for the season , Kennedy trained hard and was able to return to the Leafs in mid @-@ March . However , Toronto still finished out of a playoff position . Despite missing more than two months of the schedule Kennedy still finished second in points on the team . For his efforts Kennedy received the J. P. Bickell Memorial Trophy which is awarded by the Maple Leaf Gardens board of directors as the player most valuable to the Leafs . 
 For the 1953 – 54 season , Kennedy finished tied for second on the team in points and was elected to the NHL 's 2nd All @-@ Star team . The Leafs finished in 3rd place and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Detroit in five games . At the end of the season , Kennedy announced his intentions to retire . Conn Smythe told reporters he had tendered Kennedy " the highest offer ever made a hockey player " . This was a raise above his $ 25 @,@ 000 yearly salary ( approximately $ 200 @,@ 000 in today 's dollars ) according to a contemporary newspaper report . However , Smythe said that Kennedy had told him that lately he felt " he hadn 't produced in proportion to what he 's been paid . " Smythe insisted the Leafs needed Kennedy as Toronto was a young team . 
 Smythe was able to talk Kennedy into playing the 1954 – 55 season . At the conclusion of the season , he would win the Hart Memorial Trophy , for most valuable player , and is the last Toronto Maple Leaf to have won the trophy . To this point Kennedy had had an impressive career . He had played on five Stanley Cup teams , something no other NHL player had achieved at the time . Toronto had only missed the playoffs twice during his eleven years , one of which Kennedy was injured . By age 22 he had won three Stanley Cups and was the youngest player to have scored 100 goals . Yet , Kennedy had never won an award , nor been elected to a first All @-@ Star team . Although he did finish third in the league in assists , awarding Kennedy the Hart was considered as much as an acknowledgement of his career as his performance in the season . Kennedy along with first ever Hart recipient Frank Nighbor , are the only forwards to have won the award without finishing in the top ten in league scoring . After the Leafs were swept in four straight games in the playoffs by the Detroit Red Wings , Kennedy announced his retirement . For the second time , Kennedy was awarded with the J. P. Bickell Memorial Trophy as most valuable Toronto Maple Leaf . 
 Although missing the entire 1955 – 56 season , he came out of retirement to play half of the 1956 – 57 season to help the Leafs who were short on players due to injuries and were struggling to make the playoffs . Kennedy returned November 27 to train himself back into shape after the Leafs had won only one game in their last 11 . He scored 22 points in 30 games , but the Leafs finished out of the playoffs . He shared the captaincy with Jim Thomson . A highlight of the season was March 16 , 1957 , when the Maple Leafs scored 14 goals against the New York Rangers and Kennedy got four assists in what is still the Leafs ' all @-@ time record for goals in a single game . When it became clear the team would miss the playoffs he sat out the last two games so the management could have a look at a young Frank Mahovlich . Kennedy said , " It was time for a new generation to lead the team . " Mahovlich had practiced with Kennedy the previous day and , in expressing regret at never having played in a game with Kennedy said , " Teeder Kennedy 's last practice was my first . " 
 During Detroit Red Wing Ted Lindsay 's attempts to form a players ' union in the 1950s , he was approaching selected leaders among the other five NHL teams . Although Kennedy was the lone holdout , which greatly disappointed Lindsay , he still respected Kennedy for not informing Conn Smythe about being approached . " I won 't squeal " , Kennedy told him . According to Glenn Hall , Conn Smythe " ostracized " his captain when he discovered Kennedy had not told him about Lindsay 's endeavors . There was speculation that this led to Kennedy failing to land a job with the Leafs after retirement . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Kennedy continued for a short time after retirement as a salesman with Canadian Building Materials , with whom he had worked for during his hockey career in the off @-@ season , but soon left the company . In 1957 – 58 , he was the second coach of the Peterborough Petes OHA " Junior A " team before being succeeded by Scotty Bowman . After a successful season coaching Peterborough , Kennedy reportedly turned down an offer to coach the Toronto Maple Leafs prior to their signing of Punch Imlach . 
 He returned to Port Colborne to raise thoroughbred horses , which was an occupation he had been involved during his hockey career . Kennedy owned the Faraway Hills Farm and the St. Marys Thoroughbred Training Centre in Ontario which included a quarter @-@ mile indoor track . His horse , On Board , won the grand championship for stallions three times at the Canadian National Exhibition and at the Royal Winter Fair . 
 In 1966 Ted Kennedy was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame . In 1975 , an arena in Port Colborne , the Teeder Kennedy Youth Arena , was named in his honour . 
 Kennedy was a steward with the Ontario Racing Commission from 1977 to 1985 . In June 1979 , Kennedy was one of three stewards who scratched Come Lucky Chance from the $ 100 @,@ 000 Canadian Oaks after the horse had thrown its rider prior to the race . Infuriated by the ruling was the horse 's owner , 84 @-@ year @-@ old Conn Smythe . Although , Smythe was quoted as saying , " I 'll raise hell with only two of the stewards . " In July 1984 , Kennedy was one of the stewards for the Queen 's Plate , who ruled against an appeal by Larry Attard riding Let 's Go Blue that he was interfered with by the winning horse Key To The Moon . Kennedy was then head of security at Fort Erie Racetrack . 
 In 1987 , Kennedy appeared along with Leaf defenseman of the 1970s , Jim McKenny , in an educational video for the Ontario Government on the dangers to athletes of drug and alcohol abuse . Kennedy , an abstainer , said he was always considered " one of the boys " on the team even through he did not drink . Kennedy 's stellar career contrasted with McKenny , considered along with Bobby Orr as the best prospects in junior , had his career negatively impacted by alcoholism . 
 During his retirement , Kennedy also participated in Old @-@ Timers hockey for charity benefits . He was also an avid golfer , scoring a 215 @-@ yard hole in one in 1981 at Scarboro Golf and Country Club . 
 On October 3 , 1993 , Kennedy , along with Syl Apps , were honoured in a pre @-@ game ceremony by having banners raised at Maple Leaf Gardens . 
 In 1995 , it was reported Kennedy had again returned to live in the hometown of his youth Port Colborne . In 1999 , Kennedy underwent hip replacement surgery . 
 Ted Kennedy was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1999 . 
 Ted Kennedy died on August 14 , 2009 , in a Port Colborne nursing home , at the age of 83 , of congestive heart failure . He is survived by his wife Doreen , son Mark , two grandchildren and two great @-@ grandchildren . 
 Following the announcement of Kennedy 's passing , many fans and papers published tributes , while former NHL players paid their respects . Jean Béliveau , a former member of the rival Montreal Canadiens , expressed sadness upon the news , stating " I was certainly happy to play against him , and I 'm so sorry to hear ( of his death ) " . He would add " He was a complete centreman , a good playmaker , a good passer , good on faceoffs . " Brian Burke , the Leafs ' general manager at the time of Kennedy 's passing , issued a statement , reading " He truly was a man of great class and he was one of the most accomplished leaders in our team 's long history . " NHL commissioner Gary Bettman also issued a statement mourning Kennedy 's loss .

 = = = The quintessential Leaf = = = 
 Ted Kennedy never played for another team , never wanted to , and captained the Toronto Maple Leafs during its greatest era . He has been called the quintessential Maple Leaf . However , Kennedy was never voted to the First All @-@ Star Team . Frank Selke explained Kennedy " never made the First All @-@ Star team because he lacked one thing – colour . He 's been unlucky that way . " On another occasion Selke had said , " Many times men were named who were not his equal in all @-@ round effectiveness . " Despite Kennedy 's sparse acquisition of individual awards , many sportswriters consider Kennedy as possibly the greatest player to have played for the Toronto Maple Leafs . In the book The Maple Leafs Top 100 Kennedy is ranked second only to Dave Keon as the best Toronto Maple Leaf of all time . While The Hockey News ranked Kennedy at only # 57 on their list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players , in 2009 The Edmonton Journal published a list of top 50 NHL players of All @-@ Time and Ted Kennedy finished at # 10 , ahead of all other Maple Leafs and such players as Howie Morenz and Patrick Roy . The list , with the intention of minimizing subjectivity , was compiled using voting for the Hart and Smythe trophies for most valuable player during the regular season and playoffs respectively . When the list was adjusted to account for the fact that goalies and defensemen are traditionally overlooked for the Hart , Kennedy 's ranking even improved to # 8 . 
 = = = Playoff performer = = = 
 Kennedy had the reputation for excelling in the playoffs . He was the first player in NHL history to win five Stanley Cups and by just age 22 he had already won three Stanley Cups . Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs ' all @-@ time record for career points in Stanley Cup finals with 23 . He is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal when he scored the winning goal of game 6 in 1947 at 21 @.@ 4 years of age . Until the Pittsburgh Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 , with 22 @-@ year @-@ old Sidney Crosby as captain , Kennedy shared the honours with Wayne Gretzky as the youngest captains to have won the Cup . In 2001 The Hockey News assembled a panel of five hockey experts to choose the winners of a " would @-@ be " Conn Smythe Trophy , for best playoff performance , had the trophy been awarded prior to the 1964 – 65 season . Using microfilms of newspapers of the day and studying statistics and quotes from writers and coaches they chose winners from 1917 – 18 to 1963 – 64 . Of the players chosen more than once , only Kennedy was chosen as many as three times for his playoff performances in 1945 , 1947 and 1948 . He is fourth all @-@ time in playoff goals and sixth all @-@ time in points for the Maple Leafs 
 = = = Face @-@ off skills = = = 
 His face @-@ off skills were highly regarded and it was considered invaluable . The April 27 , 1998 , issue of Sport Illustrated published " The Best Ever on the Draw " , a poll of NHL experts of the top ten players of all time for skills on the faceoff , and Kennedy was ranked at # 1 . Lloyd Percival once called Kennedy the " Billy the Kid " of hockey . Derek Sanderson , considered the best at faceoffs in the late 60s and 70s , related how his father had him watch Kennedy on the TV to learn the skill . In a 1987 interview Kennedy told a reporter , " I went all @-@ out at face @-@ offs . Your centre is your quarterback and our other guys knew exactly what I was trying to do . " In the 1970s , GM of the Leafs , Jim Gregory asked Kennedy if he would help the team to improve their face @-@ off performance . Kennedy agreed but with one stipulation . " This can 't involve ( just ) the <unk> . It has to involve all five guys , " Kennedy told Gregory and coach Roger Neilson . " Everyone has to be in tune . Everybody has a job to do . This is a team . "

 In order to retain a consistent shape of the Stanley Cup , as there is only sufficient space for thirteen teams on each of the five lower bands , team names can only remain on the cup for 64 years . In 2005 the band for teams from 1941 to 1953 were removed and placed on display , thus Teeder Kennedy 's name no longer appears on the Stanley Cup .

 = Brodir and Ospak of Man = 
 Bróðir and Óspak of Man were two Danish brothers who were active in the Isle of Man and Ireland in the 11th century . They are mentioned in the 12th century Irish Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh and the 13th century Icelandic Njal 's Saga as key leaders who fought on opposite sides in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 . The latter account names Bróðir as the killer of Brian Boru , the High King of Ireland . Both Boru and Bróðir died in the battle , although accounts differ as to who killed whom . Óspak fought on the side of Boru , was injured , and lost his two sons in the battle . 
 = = Life = = 
 Bróðir ( also Brodir or Brodar or anglicised as Broderick ) and Óspak ( also <unk> , <unk> or Ospak ) were two Danish brothers who lived on the west coast of the Isle of Man . According to Njál 's saga , Óspak was a heathen , described as " the wisest of all men . " Bróðir had been " a Christian man and a mass @-@ deacon by consecration " , but he had <unk> and become " of all men most skilled in sorcery . " Bróðir was tall and strong , with long black hair that he wore tucked in under his belt , and he was clad in a coat of mail " which no steel could bite . " Between them , they had thirty ships , and were described by Gormflaith as " men of such hardihood that nothing can withstand them " . 
 = = = From the Isle of Man to Ireland = = = 
 Some time in the 1010s , Brian Boru divorced his second wife , the thrice married Hiberno @-@ Norse Queen Gormflaith , and she began engineering opposition to the High King . Around 1012 , relations between Brian and Leinster had become so strained that revolt broke out among the Leinstermen . Gormflaith sent her son , the King of Dublin , Sigtrygg Silkbeard , to win first the support of Earl Sigurd of Orkney , and then of Bróðir and Óspak , at any price . Sigtrygg went to Man , where he persuaded Bróðir to come to Dublin by Palm Sunday . Sigtrygg promised both Sigurd and Bróðir separately that , if successful , they would be allowed marry Gormflaith and become High King of Ireland ; the terms of this agreement , however , were to be kept secret . Óspak was dissatisfied with the arrangement , and refused to " fight against so good a king " . 
 The events leading up to the Battle of Clontarf became part of a heroic tale in subsequent tradition , both Irish and Norse , and evil portents were recorded throughout the Norse world . According to Njál 's Saga , one night a great din passed over Bróðir and his men on the Isle of Man , so that they all sprang up from sleep and dressed themselves . Until dawn , this din was accompanied by a shower of boiling blood , which scalded many of them even though they covered themselves with their shields . As a result , " a man had died on board every ship . " On the second night , they awoke to a ghostly assault on their ships by flying swords , axes and spears . Again , this lasted till dawn , and a man died on every ship . On the third night , they were attacked by ravens with iron beaks and claws , once again causing a death in every ship . 
 Bróðir consulted his brother Óspak , who believed that the signs indicated that much blood would be shed on both sides , that Bróðir 's would all die speedily , that there would be a battle , and all his men would be dragged " down to the pains of hell . " Bróðir was so angered by this that he planned to slay Óspak 's men the next day . Seeing this plan , Óspak deserted his brother during the night with ten ships . He sailed around Ireland to Connaught , and up the River Shannon , to join Brian Boru as an ally . He told King Brian all that he had learned , took baptism , and gathered his men to come to Dublin with Brian 's forces a week before Palm Sunday . 
 = = = Battle of Clontarf = = = 
 According to Njal 's saga , Bróðir tried by sorcery to predict the outcome of the battle against Brian . He <unk> that if the battle were on Good Friday , King Brian would fall but win the battle ; but if they fought on any day before , all who opposed Brian would be killed . Brian was unwilling to fight on Good Friday , as he would not fight on a fast day , but the Danes forced the battle to the Friday , which fell that year on 23 April . 
 Thus , the two brothers , Bróðir and Óspak , met again at the Battle of Clontarf , on diagonally opposite wings . Bróðir had brought with him 1000 mail @-@ clad Norsemen , and led the " murderous foreign Danes " alongside Earl Sigurd of Orkney . On the wing directly opposite Bróðir was Wolf the Quarrelsome , one of Brian 's followers . Bróðir drove deep into the opposite wing , " and felled all the foremost that stood there " , as his mail protected him from <unk> . When Wolf turned to meet him , however , he " thrust at him thrice so hard that Bróðir fell before him at each thrust " , and Bróðir " fled away into the wood at once . " The two sides were very evenly matched , and the battle raged all day , from high tide at sunrise to sunset . However , Bróðir 's absence reduced the morale of his men , and the Manx Vikings began to flee back to their ships after they were broken by the personal bodyguard of Murchad , the son of Brian , ending in an eventual victory for Brian 's allies . 
 Meanwhile , Brian , now in his seventies , had been advised to await the outcome of the battle in a tent not far from the field , and it is said that a traitor in the Irish camp , possibly Tadhg O <unk> , King of Uí Maine , had pointed out Brian 's position to Bróðir at some point during the battle . Accounts differ over whether Bróðir was the killer of Brian Boru . According to one Irish account , Bróðir overcame Brian 's guard , only to be killed by the High King who then killed himself . Njal 's saga records that Bróðir killed Brian and cried out : " Now let man tell man that Brodir felled Brian . " Two of Brian 's followers , Wolf and Kerthialfad , returned to the king , and captured Bróðir and the remainder of his men . According to the saga , " Wolf the Quarrelsome cut open his belly , and led him round and round the trunk of a tree , and so wound all his entrails out of him , " while Bróðir 's men were " slain to a man " . The modern Irish medievalist historian Donnchadh Ó Corráin , however , merely states that Bróðir was killed on the day of the battle and that Brian was killed in his tent " by Norsemen fleeing from the scene " . 
 According to Njal 's Saga , Óspak was on the wing opposite King Sigtrygg Silkbeard . Óspak went through the entire battle on this wing , and was sorely wounded and lost both his sons before Sigtrygg fled . However , that Óspak engaged Sigtrygg contradicts the historical opinion that Sigtrygg did not actually take part in the battle but was instead holding the garrison in reserve in Dublin . 
 = = Historicity and legacy = = 
 The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that the Irish surname Ó <unk> — frequently anglicised as " Broder " or " Broderick " — may be an amalgamation of the Irish element " Ó " ( " grandson of " ) and the Norse name Brodir . However , although Norse origins are often claimed for the surname , it has been on record in Ireland for centuries before the Anglo – Norman invasion . The name occurs most commonly in Munster and south @-@ east Leinster . 
 An article on the historicity of the Icelandic sagas notes that " Brodir " is not a Norse proper name at all , and is itself derived from the Irish name variously written as <unk> , <unk> or <unk> . According to the article , the name first appears in the Annals of Ulster in the year 853 , when a <unk> of south @-@ east Ireland named <unk> mac <unk> was involved in the murder of a rival before being slain himself . The name only appears in Norse context twice — at the Battle of Clontarf , and in 1160 for the King of Dublin , <unk> son of <unk> — and had a longer circulation in Irish literature . The same article also suggests that while there is no doubt about the historical truth of the Battle of Clontarf , the name " <unk> " , along with other names in the Njál 's saga account of the Clontarf episode , may have been borrowed from the Landnámabók .

 The series consists of six single @-@ player only games , and a seventh that includes multiplayer . Each game typically features a third @-@ person , fixed cinematic camera . The player controls the character Kratos in a combination of combat , platforming , and puzzle game elements to achieve goals and complete the story . A first @-@ person camera is featured in God of War III and Ascension . Betrayal is the only installment to feature a 2D side @-@ scrolling view . 
 Kratos ' main weapon is a pair of double @-@ chained blades that appear in three iterations throughout the series : the Blades of Chaos , the Blades of Athena ( or Athena 's Blades ) , and the Blades of Exile . They each perform similarly , but differ in the types of combos and amount of damage each yields , as well as cosmetic differences . Other weapons ( such as the Blade of Artemis in God of War ) are also obtained during the games . Magic is also used , and four abilities ( such as Poseidon 's Rage , Medusa 's Gaze , Zeus ' Fury , and Army of Hades in God of War ) are typically acquired . God of War III differs in that instead of separate abilities , there are four primary weapons that possess their own respective magic offensive . The game also featured " Items " — additional secondary weapons with limited usage , such as the Bow of Apollo . With each new game , most weapons and magic are lost via a plot device , and a new arsenal of weapons and abilities are acquired during gameplay . God of War : Ascension differed from previous games in that instead of acquiring new weapons that are kept throughout the entire game , the player collects up to five World Weapons ( such as a sword or a javelin ) that have limited usage . When there is not a World Weapon equipped , the player can punch or kick foes as part of a new mechanic added to the game . 
 The series offers combo @-@ based combat , and includes a quick time event ( QTE ) feature , also called context sensitive attacks , which is initiated when the player has weakened a foe . It allows limited control of Kratos during the QTE cinematic sequence ; success ends the battle , while failure usually results in damage to the player . As well as the QTE system , Ascension features a prompt @-@ less free @-@ form system , allowing players the choice of when to attack or dodge based on the enemy 's actions . A grab maneuver can be used on minor foes . 
 Relics , which the player can use in successive games ( such as Poseidon 's Trident obtained in God of War allowing Kratos to swim underwater for extended periods ) are also found and necessary for game progression . Kratos often has a special ability , which provides temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage . This ability has become an ongoing feature of gameplay throughout the series — Rage of the Gods in God of War and Ascension , Rage of the Titans in God of War II , Rage of Sparta in God of War III , and Thera 's Bane in Ghost of Sparta . This ability can be recharged by building hits on foes in combat , and gaining game @-@ specific orbs . Thera 's Bane , however , is recharged automatically . 
 Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers , found throughout the game in unmarked chests ( white chests in Ascension ) , increase the maximum amount of health and magic , respectively . Minotaur Horns , which increase the Items and Fire meter 's maximum length , are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta , respectively . The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons , called Items , and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera 's Bane . The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes , Feathers , and Horns are found . Other chests contain green , blue , or red orbs . Green orbs replenish the player 's health , blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage , and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new , more powerful attacks , and replenish the Rage meter in God of War . Gold orbs are found in God of War II and Ascension and replenish the rage meter instead of red orbs ( white orbs replaced the gold orbs in God of War III ) . Chests with changing colors , which allow players to choose which meter to replenish , have also been available . Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects . Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick @-@ time feature . 
 With the exception of Ascension , each installment offers a challenge mode , which yields extra red orbs , secret costumes , and behind @-@ the @-@ scenes videos . Bonus content can also be unlocked by defeating the game 's difficulty levels . Battle arenas , which allow players to set difficulty levels and choose their own opponents , are included in God of War II , Betrayal , God of War III , and Ghost of Sparta . A quick @-@ time sex mini @-@ game is also included in each installment except Betrayal and Ascension . 
 Ascension introduced online multiplayer to the series for both competitive and cooperative play . Up to eight players on two teams of two to four players ( or a four to eight player deathmatch ) battle for control of a map in order to earn rewards from the gods . Players can also fight each other in one @-@ on @-@ one matches . Players must sell their champion 's soul to either Zeus , Hades , Ares , or Poseidon , which allows players to try different weapons , armor sets , and powers inspired by the god of their choice , and extras can be unlocked .

 After the success of their first game Kinetica ( 2001 ) , SIE Santa Monica Studio began development of God of War in 2002 , and unveiled it two years later at SCEA Santa Monica Gamers ' Day 2004 . Game director and creator David Jaffe said that although the idea for God of War was his own , the concept owed a debt to Capcom because he had played Onimusha and said " let 's do that with Greek Mythology " . He was inspired in part by the 1981 feature film , Clash of the Titans , saying , " the real high concept for me was ... merging it with Heavy Metal magazine " . He said he liked both " the kids stuff ... with Greek Mythology " and the idea of adding more adult themes such as sex and violence . He was also inspired by the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark . Although the game is based on Greek mythology , the development team gave themselves " lots of freedom " to modify the myths , and Jaffe said they took the " coolest aspects of the subject " and created art and story using those elements . Director of visual development and lead concept artist , Charlie Wen , drew inspiration from these films as well as more contemporary films such as Gladiator ( 2000 ) for tonal inspiration to lead the visual design of Kratos , other characters , and the world of God of War . GameSpot said the developers described the gameplay " as merging the action of Devil May Cry with the puzzle @-@ solving of Ico " and noted that players would be able to " sunder enemies with a single move , such as by ripping them in half " . The game uses Santa Monica 's Kinetica engine , which they developed for Kinetica . 
 A sequel to God of War was first teased at the end of its credits , which stated , " Kratos Will Return " . God of War II was officially announced at the 2006 Game Developers Conference ( GDC ) . David Jaffe stepped down and became the creative director of its sequel and God of War 's lead animator Cory Barlog assumed the role of game director . Barlog said that in the game , players would see " a larger view of Kratos ' role within the mythological world . " Like God of War , the game uses Santa Monica 's Kinetica engine . Magic attacks became an integral part of the combat system and it was more refined . New creatures and heroes from the mythology , and more boss battles were added . Both Jaffe and Barlog said that they did not view God of War II as a sequel , but rather a continuation of the previous game . Jaffe said that they did not want to include the Roman numeral number two ( II ) in the title for this reason , but they did not want the title to convey the impression it was an expansion pack . Both Jaffe and Barlog said that the reason God of War II appeared on the PlayStation 2 instead of the PlayStation 3 — which was released four months prior to God of War II — was because " there 's a 100 million people out there that will be able to play God of War II as soon as it launches . " Barlog assured that the game would be playable on the newer platform , which had PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility . 
 God of War III was first mentioned by Cory Barlog at a God of War II launch event , and it was officially announced at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) . After the first eight months of development , Barlog left Santa Monica for unexplained reasons and Stig Asmussen ( lead environment artist and art director on God of War and God of War II , respectively ) became director . Asmussen said that one of the greatest challenges in developing God of War III for the PlayStation 3 was the " complexity of everything " ; individual tasks , such as designing Helios ' decapitation , could take a year because the " level of detail [ that was ] expected [ was ] so high and intricate , it [ crossed ] multiple departments . " He said that the PlayStation 3 's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment . The engine for God of War III was ported from the first two installments to the PlayStation 3 . As the game was being developed , the code department swapped out PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components . They replaced the renderer , the particle system , and the collision system . Although they were re @-@ using the engine from God of War II , the core engine for God of War III was brand new . Between E3 2009 and the time the game shipped , morphological anti @-@ aliasing ( MLAA ) was added , which graphics engineer Ben Diamand said " improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame @-@ rate . " Diamand also said that " depth @-@ of @-@ field , motion blur , crepuscular ' god ' rays and refraction were either added or improved in quality and speed " during that same time period . 
 On April 12 , 2012 , Sony released a teaser image for Ascension on its official PlayStation Facebook page , which was followed by the game 's announcement on April 19 on PlayStation.Blog. Todd Papy , who had previously worked as a designer on God of War and God of War II and as design director on God of War III , assumed the role of game director ; God of War III director Stig Asmussen was busy with another project at Santa Monica and did not work on Ascension . The announcement officially confirmed the game 's title and Papy said it was not titled God of War IV to avoid confusion because it is a prequel , rather than a sequel , to the trilogy . The game features a retooled God of War III engine , enabling online multiplayer battles for up to eight players . The decision to add multiplayer came about from curiosity , according to lead combat designer Jason McDonald . The multiplayer was first tested using Kratos , and McDonald said the testers had " a lot of fun " . Seeing their reaction made the team feel that the multiplayer had value and they then began to put the " God of War spin on it " . In the developmental transition from God of War III to Ascension , one of the graphics engineers , Cedric Perthuis , noted that the limits of the God of War III engine restricted artist creativity , so they " tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance . " Ascension did not have a graphical leap over its predecessor like God of War III did . Dynamic lighting was added , which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic . Particle effects were also greatly improved upon from God of War III .

 Game developer Ready at Dawn pitched the idea of a God of War game for the PlayStation Portable to Santa Monica Studio soon after the original God of War launched . Cory Barlog officially confirmed the development of Chains of Olympus at a God of War II launch event , stating " It is its own story that connects to the overall story . " Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary , in @-@ house engine referred to as the Ready at Dawn engine , which expanded on the engine created for their previous game , Daxter ( 2006 ) . Originally designed for the PlayStation Portable 's restricted 222 megahertz ( MHz ) processor , Ready at Dawn convinced Sony to increase the clock speed of the PSP to 333 MHz , which they did in a firmware upgrade . The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects , lighting effects , and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence , but noticeably decreased battery life . After the game 's completion , game director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles , characters , and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints . 
 Ghost of Sparta was announced on May 4 , 2010 , on PlayStation.Blog. According to Sony , Ready at Dawn utilized " state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art visual technologies " that allowed " higher quality environments and characters . " Ghost of Sparta offers " over 25 % more gameplay " than Chains of Olympus , while adding more enemies on screen and more boss encounters . Development of Ghost of Sparta took 23 months to complete . Due to Weerasuriya 's schedule at Ready at Dawn , he could not return to direct ; Dana Jan , the lead level designer for Chains of Olympus , became director for Ghost of Sparta . At Comic @-@ Con 2010 , Jan noted that when development began in 2008 , the goal was to make the game bigger than Chains of Olympus , which had apparently pushed the PSP to its functional limits . Jan stated that Ghost of Sparta has taken the PSP to its " absolute capacity " , with another feature being more on @-@ screen foes . The game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained the platinum trophy from God of War III . The trophy revealed a site called spartansstandtall.com , which became the official site for Ghost of Sparta on May 4 . Jan stated the reason they chose to have the game take place between God of War and God of War II was because " It seemed to make a lot of sense to fill in that void . "

 Betrayal was announced by Sony Online Entertainment at a press conference in Los Angeles in May 2007 . The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series ' three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) graphics . Game director Phil Cohen said that although the game was enjoyable to develop , the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes , and that met Santa Monica Studio 's high standards . Cohen wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005 , and revisited it in August 2006 , the month development started . The versions for high @-@ end handsets were completed in April 2007 , with final versions for low @-@ end handsets completed by June 2007 . The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks . Both David Jaffe and Cory Barlog ensured that the Betrayal development team captured the feel of the combat and visual style , and were " helpful with feedback and positive support " .

 A film adaptation of the first game was announced in 2005 . Creator David Jaffe confirmed that a completed script had been written by David Self and would be sent to an unspecified director . He said that Universal Studios is behind the making of the God of War movie , but was unaware of its current status , and eventually said , " it 's doubtful that the film will even be made " . In September 2010 , Jaffe said that the " script went out a year and a half ago to Daniel Craig who plays [ James ] Bond , but he turned it down " . He also said that another actor had since been cast as Kratos ; he said , " this new person is pretty good , if that ends up true . " In July 2012 , The Hollywood Reporter said that writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan had been hired to adapt the God of War film . On August 30 , 2012 , the writers told IGN that they intend to " humanize " Kratos and explore his past . Melton said that they are emotionally invested and it could become a series of films , and that Ares " will become a more proactive villain " . As of 2016 , the movie is without a director , no actors have been confirmed , and a release date has not been set , but the script has been " turned in " . It has a budget of $ 150 million USD .
