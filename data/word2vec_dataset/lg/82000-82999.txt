 = 1973 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 1973 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone meteorology . The most important system this year was Hurricane Ava , which was the most intense Pacific hurricane known at the time . Several other much weaker tropical cyclones came close to , or made landfall on , the Pacific coast of Mexico . The most serious of these was Hurricane Irah , which downed power and communication lines in parts of the Baja California Peninsula ; the other landfalling storms caused rain and some flooding . No tropical cyclone this season caused any deaths . 
 This season had a quick start but a slow end . Overall activity was below average , with twelve named systems in total . Of these , five were tropical storms , seven were hurricanes , of which three were major ( Category 3 or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale ) . Just one storm formed in August , one of the least active Augusts ever in the east Pacific . The season officially started May 15 , 1973 in the eastern Pacific , and June 1 , 1973 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1973 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . All tropical cyclones this season formed in the eastern north Pacific Ocean , often off the coast of Mexico . As is usual in the northern hemisphere , most traveled generally westward or northwestward , and two reached as far as the waters south of the Hawaiian Islands . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The season began with the formation of the pre @-@ Ava tropical depression on June 2 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Lillian on October 9 . The season lasted a total of 129 days . No named storms formed in May , three in June , four in July , one in August , three in September , one in October , and none in November . Another six tropical depressions formed during the year , but data on them is unavailable . All of these tropical cyclones formed in the eastern north Pacific tropical cyclone basin , which encompasses the Pacific Ocean north of the equator east of 140 ° W. None formed in the central north Pacific , which is the remainder of the Pacific Ocean east of the international dateline . 
 Of the tropical cyclones that formed this year , were twelve tropical storms and seven were hurricanes . Of those hurricanes , three of them were major hurricanes because they reached Category 3 or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Scale . These totals are all below the long @-@ term averages of thirteen tropical storms , nine hurricanes , and four major hurricanes . At the time , this season 's total of twelve named tropical cyclones was exactly average , although at the time the climatology in this basin was weak because satellite coverage was spotty before 1966 . 
 This season , all advisories and tropical cyclone data were released and collected by two agencies , the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in Redwood City , California , and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu , Hawaii , both of which were coextensive with the National Weather Service Forecast Offices in their respective cities . The EPHC covered the area between the coast of North America and 140 ° W , and the CPHC the remainder of the area . 
 = = = Hurricane Ava = = = 
 A tropical depression formed on June 2 . It steadily strengthened and headed in a generally westerly direction . It moved slowly and became Hurricane Ava on June 4 . Two days later , it became a major hurricane and it sped up . On June 7 , it became a Category 5 hurricane . It then started weakening and slowed down until it dissipated on June 12 . No deaths or damages were attributed to Hurricane Ava . 
 Ava 's minimum central pressure was 915 millibars , and its maximum sustained winds reached 140 knots ( 260 km / h ) . This made Ava the most intense recorded east Pacific hurricane at the time . Ava reached Category 5 intensity on June 7 , the earliest date in an east Pacific season that a hurricane has done so . It was also the second known Category 5 storm in the east Pacific ; ( behind Patsy in 1959 ) . Ava is the strongest June storm , the fifth most intense east Pacific hurricane , and was the only June Category 5 on record until 2010 . 
 Ava was also flown into by hurricane hunter aircraft in what was the first penetration of a Pacific hurricane by NOAA aircraft . During these flights , radars and other devices were tested , and wind speed , pressure , and wave heights were measured . This is the reason why Hurricane Ava 's pressure is measured instead of estimated . Ava was also photographed from Skylab because it was visible during one of the missions . At that time , it was coincidentally on the surface of the Earth directly underneath the space station . All in all , these made Hurricane Ava one of the best @-@ observed Pacific hurricanes at the time . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Bernice = = = 
 A nearly stationary disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone spent three days organizing and finally developed into a tropical depression on June 22 . The cyclone started heading northwest . After intensifying into a tropical storm , Bernice made landfall on June 23 at a location roughly 50 mi ( 80 km ) southwest of Zihuatanejo . It dissipated later that day . Bernice exposed two ships to gales , but otherwise neither deaths nor significant impact was reported . At its peak , Tropical Storm Bernice had winds of 70 miles per hour ( 110 km / h ) . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Claudia = = = 
 A tropical depression formed June 26 from a westward @-@ moving area of disturbed weather . The next day , it developed gale @-@ force winds and was named Claudia . Claudia headed northwesterly and then northwards and made landfall on June 28 approximately 30 mi ( 50 km ) east of Acapulco . It dissipated inland the next day . No deaths or casualties were reported due to this tropical cyclone . 
 = = = Hurricane Doreen = = = 
 On July 18 , a tropical storm formed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and was named Doreen . It steadily intensified , and became a hurricane on July 19 . Doreen briefly reached Category 4 strength on July 21 with a relatively high central pressure of 972 mb ( 28 @.@ 7 inHg ) . It then weakened steadily as its path carried it on a direct path to the Big Island of Hawaii . Doreen weakened to a tropical storm as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility on July 25 . A frontal system stuck between two high @-@ pressure areas weakened as the two areas merged , creating a larger high pressure area that turned Doreen to the southwest on July 27 . The hurricane then turned back to the northwest and strengthened back into a hurricane . It became a major hurricane again before weakening . Doreen dissipated August 3 . Its remnant vortex continued westward until it dissipated under a trough near the dateline . Doreen 's sudden change of track and restrengthening was unusual . 
 From formation to dissipation , Doreen lasted 16 @.@ 25 days and traveled a distance of 4 @,@ 200 mi ( 6 @,@ 760 km ) . This tied Hurricane Celeste 's record for longest @-@ lasting Pacific hurricane . Doreen was also the longest @-@ lasting July tropical cyclone . Hurricane Fico broke both of these records in the 1978 season . Doreen remains the eighth @-@ longest lasting Pacific tropical cyclone , tied with two other storms . Several ships encountered Doreen . The most serious incident involved a Greek ship called Cornelia which lost its rudder in 35 ft ( 10 m ) waves , but managed to escape and continue on its way to Panama . On the afternoon of July 29 , 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) swells and 3 @.@ 5 ft ( 0 m ) waves were seen from <unk> . Otherwise , no damages or deaths were blamed on this tropical cyclone . 
 = = = Hurricane Emily = = = 
 A depression formed July 21 from squalls in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and headed west @-@ northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm . Emily continued moving nearly parallel to the coast before turning to the west while steadily intensifying . Emily eventually reached Category 4 intensity on July 22 . Emily then weakened as it turned to the northwest . It dissipated on July 28 . Emily 's wind field was large enough to bring gales areas 300 mi ( 480 km ) east of the hurricane from July 22 to 24 . This tropical cyclone caused no deaths or damage . 
 = = = Hurricane Florence = = = 
 On July 25 , a depression formed off the coast of Guatemala . The storm made a close approach to the Mexican coast as a depression , but did not make landfall . Just after that , it strengthened into a tropical storm . Florence headed west and then west @-@ northwest . It became a hurricane on July 29 . It began weakening thereafter . Florence dissipated on July 30 . No damages or deaths were reported . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Glenda = = = 
 A depression that had formed on July 30 from a tropical disturbance quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Glenda . It took a path similar to both Florence and Emily , but further from the shore . Glenda dissipated August 5 . At the time it still had winds of 40 knots ( 70 km / h ) , down from its peak of 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) . No deaths , damage , or other impact was reported . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Heather = = = 
 The only storm to form in August this year formed on August 31 from an area of circulation in the ITCZ over the Gulf of Tehuantepec . It became a tropical depression on August 30 . After moving northwest for a bit , it became a tropical storm and headed almost due north towards Mexico . Heather dissipated September 1 , just before making landfall . Tropical Storm Heather caused no deaths or damage to any location in the coastal area of the Gulf of Tehuantepec . 
 = = = Hurricane Irah = = = 
 A depression formed September 22 . It became a tropical storm on September 23 and a hurricane on September 24 . Irah took a northwesterly path and reached Category 2 strength on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , and then dropped back down to a 1 as it recurved . It made landfall on Baja California and entered the Gulf of California as a tropical storm , making landfall again in northwestern Mexico approximately 30 mi ( 50 km ) northwest of Los Mochis . Irah 's first landfall was the strongest of the season . The hurricane dissipated on September 27 while heading east @-@ northeast over mainland Mexico . 
 Irah blew over some power and communication lines during its passage over the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . Heavy rain fell over parts of Mexico , with the highest total being 10 @.@ 24 in ( 260 mm ) at Sierra de la Laguna . One person was injured and at least ten houses were destroyed in Cabo San Lucas . No one was killed . There was some concern that the hurricane could disrupt splashdown procedures for astronauts at the end of Skylab 3 ; however , the return to Earth was not seriously affected . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Jennifer = = = 
 On September 23 , another depression formed . It took a northeasterly path , rotating around the southern periphery of Hurricane Irah as part of a Fujiwara interaction . It strengthened into a tropical storm late on September 24 . The peak windspeed of this tropical cyclone was 40 miles per hour ( 60 km / h ) . Jennifer then weakened to a depression and turned to the north @-@ northeast . Jennifer brushed the Islas Marías . The cyclone made landfall near just southeast of Mazatlán and dissipated September 27 . Tropical Depression Jennifer caused rain over several parts of Mexico . The highest total was 7 @.@ 48 in ( 190 mm ) at Navarette / San Blas . No one was killed and no damage was reported . 
 = = = Hurricane Katherine = = = 
 Katherine became a tropical storm on September 29 , just six hours after forming . It headed out to sea . On October 1 , it became a hurricane . It peaked in windspeed the next day . After weakening to storm strength , it crossed 140 ° W and entered the central Pacific . Katherine continued its slightly south of westward track . It dropped to a depression on October 9 , and dissipated shortly after that due to the influence of a cold trough . The storm never threatened land , causing no casualties or damage . 
 = = = Hurricane Lillian = = = 
 A depression that formed October 5 reached storm strength the same day . It generally paralleled the coast of Mexico far offshore . Lillian reached minimal hurricane strength on October 7 and peaked the next day . The hurricane began to weaken immediately thereafter and dissipated on October 9 . Through its life , Lillian at first traveled generally west @-@ northwestward , and then westward . Lillian never threatened land , causing no known impact . 
 = = 1973 Storm Names = = 
 These names were used for storms that formed in the eastern Pacific during this season . It is the same list used in the 1969 season . Storms were named Katherine and Lillian for the first time this year . No names were retired , so this list was used again in the 1977 season . Names that weren 't assigned are colored gray . 
 The Central Pacific used names and numbers from the Western Pacific 's typhoon list . No systems formed in the area , and thus no names were required . 
 = Varaha Upanishad = 
 Varaha Upanishad ( Sanskrit : <unk> उपनिषत ् , " boar " ) is a minor Upanishad of Hinduism composed between the 13th and 16th centuries CE . Composed in Sanskrit , it is listed as one of the 32 Krishna Yajurveda Upanishads , and classified as one of 20 Yoga Upanishads . 
 The text has five chapters , structured primarily as a discussion between Vishnu in his Varaha ( boar ) avatar and the sage Ribhu . The discussion covers the subjects of Tattvas , the nature and relationship between the individual soul ( Self , Atman ) and the Ultimate Reality ( Brahman ) , the seven stages of learning , the characteristics of Jivanmukti ( inner sense of freedom while living ) , and the four types of <unk> ( liberated persons ) . The last chapter of the text is dedicated to Yoga , its goals and methods . 
 It is , as an Upanishad , a part of the corpus of Vedanta literature that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism . The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that liberation from sorrow and fear requires a human being to know the non @-@ dualistic nature of existence , oneness between Self , Brahman and Vishnu , and the role of Yoga in self @-@ liberation , and lists ten Yamas ( virtues ) as essential to a liberation of one 's soul : nonviolence , satya , asteya , brahmacharya , compassion , rectitude , <unk> , non @-@ hypocrisy , <unk> , and <unk> . The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state , amongst other things , is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him , who does not shrink out of fear from the world , nor the world shrinks from him with fear , and whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger , fear , and joy toward others . 
 = = Etymology and anthology = = 
 Varaha means boar , specifically referring to the incarnation of Vishnu as a boar in Indian mythology . The term Upanishad means it is knowledge or " hidden doctrine " text that belongs to the corpus of Vedanta literature presenting the philosophical concepts of Hinduism and considered the highest purpose of its scripture , the Vedas . The text is also known as <unk> . 
 The text is listed as 98th in the modern era anthology that consists of 108 Upanishads . A Sanskrit text , it is considered one of the 32 Upanishads under the Krishna Yajurveda or Black Yajurveda . Classified as a Yoga Upanishad , the author , authenticity , and source of this Hindu text has been in question , and it is a late Upanishad . Varaha Upanishad was not listed in the anthology of known Upanishads published in the 17th century by Dara Shikoh , in the early 19th @-@ century Henry Thomas Colebrooke anthology , or in the Narayana compilations of Upanishads . 
 = = Chronology = = 
 The text opens by acknowledging <unk> ( Epics , Ramayana and Mahabharata ) and other post @-@ Vedic era texts , thus implying that it was composed in the common era . The text incorporates terminology such as Yogi Siddhi , suggesting that , like other Yoga Upanishads , it was composed after Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and other major Yoga texts . The text also incorporates sections on tantra terminology such as Chakra and <unk> in its discussion of Laya , Mantra , and Hatha yoga . The minor Yoga Upanishads , according to Antonio <unk> , a professor of <unk> at the University Ca ' Foscari of Venice , were recorded in the medieval period of India 's Advaita and Yoga @-@ rooted traditions , possibly in the middle of the 2nd millennium CE , but may well represent already established ideas and practices before the epic and medieval period , given that they use concepts and terminology rooted in the 1st millennium BCE Vedic era text , such as <unk> , Atman , and Brahman . 
 According to Ananda , the text was likely composed between the 13th and 16th centuries . 
 = = Contents = = 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 Ribhu , after observing Tapas ( penance ) for 12 long deva years , is visited by Vishnu in his Varaha avatar ; the latter asks Ribhu what boon he would like . Ribhu declines all worldly pleasures , and asks Vishnu to explain " that science of Brahman which treats of thy nature , a knowledge which leads to salvation " . From this point on , the Upanishad is structured as a sermon by Varaha to the sage Ribhu . It has five chapters with a total of 247 verses . 
 = = = Tattvas = = = 
 In Chapter 1 of the text , Varaha tells Ribhu first about the science of Tattvas , meaning " principles " . The Tattvas are said to be 24 , 36 , or even 96 by some teachers , which Varaha elaborates . 
 In the Tattvas , asserts Varaha , are included the five sensory organs , five organs of action , five vital airs essential to a living body ( " Vital airs " of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) , five rudimentary principles of perception , and the faculties of knowledge – Manas ( mind ) which produces uncertain knowledge , Buddhi ( intelligence ) which leads to certain knowledge , " Chitta " ( emotional consciousness ) which produces doubts and fluctuations in knowledge , and " <unk> " ( ego ) which produces egoism . These total 24 tattvas , states the text . 
 Some scholars , asserts Varaha , expand the list of tattvas of a human body to 36 , by including the five elements – earth ( Prithvi ) , air ( Vayu ) , water ( Ap ) , ether ( Akasha ) , and fire ( Agni ) ; the three bodies – the gross , the subtle and the causal ( <unk> ) ; three states of consciousness – when awake , when dreaming , and when in dreamless sleep ; and one jiva ( soul ) . 
 Varaha then describes how the list of tattva increases to 96 in verses 1 @.@ 8 to 1 @.@ 14 . It includes the six stages of changes ( Aiyar translates this to " existence , birth , growth , transformation , decay , and destruction " ) ; six maladies or " infirmities " ( hunger , thirst , suffering , delusion , age , and death ) ; <unk> or six sheaths ( " skin , blood , flesh , fat , marrow , and bones " ) ; six adversities or foes of a body ( " longing , anger , craving , arrogance , and malice " ) ; three aspects of " jiva " – " Vishva " ( world ) , " Taijasa " ( endowed with light ) , and " Prajna " ( insight into nature of reality ) ; three " Guṇas " or qualities , innate psyche ( " Sattva , Rajas , and Tamas " ) ; three types of Karmas ( " <unk> " ( past karma now being enjoyed ) , " <unk> " ( past karma yet to be enjoyed ) , and " <unk> " ( current karma to be enjoyed later ) ) ; five actions ( " talking , lifting , walking , excreting , and enjoying " ) ; and tattvas of " thought , certainty , egoism , compassion , kindness , anticipation , sympathy , and indifference " . To complete its list of 96 , the Varaha adds " Dik " , or the four quarters , all Vedic deities who are part of the human body , namely " Vayu " ( air , ear ) , Sun ( light , eye ) , " Varuna " ( water , tongue ) , Ashvini Devas ( nose ) , Agni ( fire ) , Indra , Upendra , and <unk> ( death ) ; it includes the moon , the four @-@ faced Brahma , Rudra , <unk> ( the conscious knower of the body ) , and Ishvara . 
 Vishnu , as Varaha , asserts in verses 1 @.@ 15 to 1 @.@ 17 , that he is " other than aggregate of these 96 Tattvas " , and those who worship him in his Varaha avatar and know these 96 tattvas remove their <unk> ( ignorance ) , achieve salvation regardless of which order of life they are in , whether they have shaven head , or head full of hair , or maintain a head with only a tuft of hair . 
 = = = Brahmavidya = = = 
 The Varaha , in the 83 verses of Chapter 2 , explains to Ribhu how to achieve the most exalted knowledge of Brahmavidya , and then what it is . He tells Ribhu that the four means of this knowledge are to practice conduct of one 's Varna ( caste ) and one 's Ashrama ( stage in life ) , from ascetic austerity and with the help of a Guru ( spiritual teacher ) . The Varaha then states that the path to Brahmavidya is through the capacity to distinguish between the ephemeral and the eternal , detachment from the material world unto the spiritual world . A sincere longing for spiritual liberation and six virtuous qualities ( <unk> ) are essential in order to achieve Brahmavidya , asserts the Upanishad , these being tranquility , self @-@ restraint , doing work without craving for rewards , endurance , faith , and meditation . Varaha states in verse 2 @.@ 4 that the truly blessed are those who know Brahman and Atman and have thus become one with them . 
 Ribhu then asks Varaha , " Taking birth as a human , that is also a male and a Brahmin is difficult , a yogi who has studied the Vedanta but who does not know the form of Vishnu , how can such an ignorant one become liberated ? " 
 Varaha replies in verses 2 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 9 that he alone is Supreme Bliss , that apart from the Atman ( soul ) there exists no Ishvara or phenomenal world . Those who know their Atman ( soul ) have no notions of Varna ( caste ) or Ashrama ( stage in life ) ; they see Atman as Brahman , they become Brahman and reach " Moksha " salvation even without seeking . That which is of the character of Truth , Knowledge , Bliss , and <unk> , states Varaha Upanishad in verse 2 @.@ 16 , stands farthest away from Tamas ( darkness , destruction , chaos ) . 
 Varaha states that what one aspires to is part of His own " light " , which is all @-@ encompassing . As Atman , self effulgent , Varaha states that " Brahma @-@ <unk> " are those who see nothing but the Brahman , and they are happy and content in the universe despite being subject to sufferings . 
 The Varaha Upanishad asserts the non @-@ dualistic premise that Brahman and Atman are one , and those who know this fear nothing , suffer nothing , and possess fortitude . He is I , states Vishnu . " Become that , Ribhu ; Thou am I verily " , suggests Vishnu . Those high souled ones , who with the firm conviction that " I am the Brahman " , are the Jivanmukta , states verse 2 @.@ 43 of the text . 
 = = = = Sankalpa = = = = 
 According to the Upanishad , the entire universe evolves by Sankalpa ( a thinking , ideation process ) , one becomes what one thinks , metaphysics affects physics , and it is ideation that helps retain the appearances of the world . Following renunciation from this universe , which is also called a Sankalpa , the meditating mind is to be focused on the Nirvikalpa ( the unchangeable ) or the unchangeable part ( metaphysical reality ) . Varaha in verse 2 @.@ 64 compares the " samsara " ( cycle of rebirth ) to the domain of karma , states Billington , one that is like a long dream ( " <unk> " ) , a delusion , a sea of sorrow . It defines <unk> as someone who has overcome and attained liberation from this samsara through self @-@ knowledge . 
 = = = = Meditation = = = = 
 Varaha explains that through obeisance to Him who is found in everything , and doing meditation for just 48 minutes ( a <unk> ) , will expand his wisdom to the state of " <unk> " , the state of Atman which is forever liberated . It means living close to <unk> ( soul ) and Paramatman ( the Supreme Soul ) . 
 The Upanishad states that knowledge of Brahman results in knowing spiritual truth in the <unk> ( indirect cognition ) way , but <unk> ( direct realization ) results in knowing that his own soul is Brahman . And when a practitioner of Yoga becomes a <unk> ( liberated soul ) , he knows that his Atman is the ultimate perfection . To an enlightened person who has realized Brahman , the two words " bondage " and " moksha " mean " mine " and " not mine " . " Mine " is linked to a person , but " not mine " relates to one who is liberated from all thinking and knows Atman . 
 = = = = Samadhi = = = = 
 In verses 2 @.@ 75 through 2 @.@ 87 , the Varaha Upanishad defines the goal of Yoga and what is " Samadhi " , as follows : 
 The state of Samadhi , it explains , is akin to salt dissolving in water , and the quality of oneness that results . 
 = = = Vishnu is Shiva = = = 
 The Upanishad , in Chapter 3 , continues the sermon of Vishnu to Ribhu , that " Ribhu should develop the conviction that he himself is palpable Existence and Consciousness , indivisible , without a counterpart , devoid of all visibility , non @-@ ailing , flawless , the Shiva without a double " . The text reasserts its non @-@ dualism in Chapter 3 , adding that bhakti to Vishnu is the path to liberating knowledge of Brahman . In verse 3 @.@ 14 – 3 @.@ 15 , states Ayyangar , everyone is equal in the eyes of god , there is no difference between living forms and human beings based on law , family , caste , or clan , and everyone is one Truth and Absolute Brahman . The " Vishnu is Shiva " and " all is Shiva " theme repeats in verse 4 @.@ 32 , which declares , " The Guru is Shiva , the Veda is Shiva , the Deva is Shiva , the Lord is Shiva , I Varaha am Shiva , all is Shiva , other than Shiva there is naught " . 
 The Ultimate Truth , states the text , is that which always is , which preserves its nature over time , and which is unaffected by anything . The Atman , the Brahman , the " Chit , Sat and Ananda " , and <unk> ( Vishnu ) is such Truth , and they are synonymous , one . Some try to seek <unk> , asserts the Upanishad , through mantras , religious rituals , time , skill , medicine , or wealth , but such <unk> are fleeting and fruitless . Be an <unk> ( one with Self @-@ knowledge ) through Yoga , says Vishnu to Ribhu , and to such a person Siddhis are of no importance . 
 = = = Seven stages of knowledge = = = 
 The Varaha Upanishad , in Chapter 4 , states that individuals gain knowledge through seven stages : First , one must have virtuous desire to learn , discover ( Subh @-@ <unk> ) . The second stage is inquiry , investigation ( <unk> ) . <unk> and thinning of mind toward other objects ( <unk> ) is the third stage , states the text . The fourth stage is harmony , creative union with the subject of knowledge ( Sattva @-@ <unk> ) . Detachment from everything else ( <unk> ) is the fifth stage . Conceptual analysis and gaining complete , correct meaning of the topic ( Pad @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ) is the sixth stage . The seventh or last stage is Turiya , complete consciousness . 
 The text states that <unk> is a means for meditating on the nature of Atman and Brahman , wherein " A " represents <unk> and Visva , " U " represents <unk> and Taijasa , M represents Makara and Prajna , the <unk> that follows <unk> , represents the Turiya . 
 = = = = The characteristics of a Jivanmukta = = = = 
 The Varaha Upanishad , in a manner similar to many ancient and medieval era Hindu texts , discusses moksha in this life ( rather than afterlife ) , or Jivanmukti , calling those who have reached such a state a Jivanmukta ( self @-@ realized person ) . The verses 4 @.@ 21 – 4 @.@ 30 describe the characteristics of a Jivanmukta ; Ayyangar and Aiyar state as follows : 
 He who is engrossed in the ways of the world , yet his mind is steady , like ether , is said to be Jivanmukta 
 He whose mental radiance neither rises nor sets , whose inner state is neither affected by happiness nor by misery inflicted on him , is said to be Jivanmukta 
 He who is wakeful while remaining asleep , he whose mental alertness is devoid of impressions , is known as Jivanmukta 
 He who responds to influences such as hatred , fear , love , yet his heart remains pure like Akasha ( aether , space ) , is said to be Jivanmukta 
 He whose attitude is not be attached to anything , his intellect never clouded whether active or passive , is a Jivanmukta 
 He who does not shrink out of fear from the world , nor the world shrinks from him , who is free from anger , fear and joy , is a Jivanmukta 
 He whose mind is not agitated , though participating in the world , who rests in state of calmness and absolute consciousness , no matter what , is known as Jivanmukta 
 The concept and characteristics of Jivanmukta in Varaha Upanishad is similar , states <unk> , but other Upanishads develop these ideas further and in greater depth . 
 = = = Yoga = = = 
 Chapter 5 of the Varaha Upanishad is dedicated to Yoga , as a discussion between Ribhu and his student <unk> . There are three types of Yoga , states the text , and these are Laya ( soft ) , Mantra ( mystic ) , and Hatha ( middle ) , recommending Hatha Yoga as foremost of three . It discusses various aspects of Yoga , ranging from recommending that healthy food should be eaten in temperate quantities , in small portions , several times a day , to recommending that Yoga should not be performed when one is not feeling well or is very hungry . The goal of Yoga , states Varaha , is manifold , including the gain of body strength and suppleness , acquisition of knowledge of one 's own body and its auras , meditation , and Self ( soul ) knowledge . 
 = = = = <unk> : Yamas and Niyamas = = = = 
 The <unk> in the Varaha Upanishad is presented in Chapter 5 as ten Yamas and ten Niyamas . This list is similar to the list found in other Yoga texts such as the Shandilya Upanishad , as well as by <unk> : 
 Ahiṃsā ( अहिंसा ) : nonviolence 
 Satya ( सत ् य ) : truthfulness 
 Asteya ( <unk> ् <unk> ) : not stealing 
 Brahmacharya ( ब ् रह ् <unk> ् य ) : celibacy when single , not cheating on one 's partner 
 <unk> ( क ् षमा ) : forgiveness 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) : fortitude 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) : compassion 
 Ārjava ( आर ् <unk> ) : non @-@ hypocrisy , sincerity 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) : measured diet 
 Śauca ( <unk> ) : purity , cleanliness 
 The Varaha Upanishad along with the Shandilya , suggests ten niyamas in the sense of positive duties , desirable behaviors , and discipline . The Varaha 's <unk> list in Chapter 5 for observances include : 
 Tapas : persistence , perseverance in one 's purpose , penance austerity 
 <unk> : contentment , acceptance of others and of one 's circumstances as they are , joy 
 Āstika : faith in Real Self ( jnana yoga , raja yoga ) , belief in God ( bhakti yoga ) , conviction in Vedas / Upanishads ( orthodox school ) 
 Dāna : generosity , charity , sharing with others 
 <unk> : worship of the Ishvara ( God / Supreme Being , Brahman , True Self , <unk> Reality ) 
 <unk> <unk> : listening to the ancient scriptures , texts about ethics , values , and principles 
 Hrī : remorse and acceptance of one 's past , modesty , humility 
 Mati : think and reflect to understand , reconcile conflicting ideas 
 Japa : mantra repetition , reciting prayers or knowledge 
 Vrata : keeping promises , fast rituals , observing pilgrimage and yajna 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 The Upanishad makes mention of eleven asanas ( Yogic postures ) , of which two pertain to physiological postures : the Peacock and the Rooster . It describes squatting with folded legs known as <unk> , a meditative pose . 
 Varaha gives a simile of an artist practicing dance to an orchestra , balancing a vessel on her head . She is focused only on the stability of the pot , in the same manner a practitioner of Yoga always contemplates on the Brahman . The yogic practice should be centered on the " spiritual sound " only . Immersion and self @-@ absorption in music is a form of yoga . Varaha encourages introspection , and states that a person discerning his own mistakes will be free of attachments in life . 
 = = = = Kundalini = = = = 
 Varaha emphatically states that Kundalini or corporeal energy is the ultimate power of truth . It is further states that prana , the life force , exists in the Nadis ( channels , pipes or tubes ) , which run in the body , emanating from the sole of the foot and running to the skull of the head . The six Chakras beginning with Muladhara are said to be the seat of Shakti . From the neck to the top of the head is said to be the seat of Shambu .

The former served in the Far East during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 while the latter was involved in pioneering long @-@ range radio experiments several years later before deploying to South American waters . Carlo Alberto then served as a training ship for several years . Both ships participated in the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 and played minor roles in World War I , during which time Carlo Alberto was converted into a troop transport and Vettor Pisani into a repair ship . They were both discarded in 1920 and subsequently scrapped . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The ships of the class had a length between perpendiculars of 99 meters ( 324 ft 10 in ) and an overall length of 105 @.@ 7 meters ( 346 ft 9 in ) . They had a beam of 18 @.@ 04 meters ( 59 ft 2 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 2 meters ( 23 ft 7 in ) . They displaced 6 @,@ 397 – 6 @,@ 614 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 296 – 6 @,@ 510 long tons ) at normal load , and 7 @,@ 057 – 7 @,@ 128 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 946 – 7 @,@ 015 long tons ) at deep load . The Vettor Pisani class had a complement of 28 officers and 472 to 476 enlisted men . 
 The ships were powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft . Steam for the engines was supplied by eight Scotch marine boilers and their exhausts were trunked into a pair of funnels amidships . Designed for a maximum output of 13 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 9 @,@ 700 kW ) and a speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) , both ships exceeded their designed power during their sea trials although only Carlo Alberto met her designed speed . The two had a cruising radius of about 5 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 000 km ; 6 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The main armament of the Vettor Pisani @-@ class ships consisted of twelve quick @-@ firing ( QF ) Cannone da 152 / 40 A Modello 1891 guns in single mounts . These 152 mm ( 6 in ) weapons had 40 @-@ caliber barrels . All of these guns were mounted on the broadside , eight on the upper deck and four at the corners of the central citadel in armored casemates . The <unk> guns weighed 6 @.@ 6 metric tons ( 6 @.@ 5 long tons ) and fired a 45 @.@ 4 @-@ kilogram ( 100 lb ) , armor @-@ piercing , capped shell at a muzzle velocity of 700 m / s ( 2 @,@ 297 ft / s ) . 
 Single 40 @-@ caliber QF Cannone da 120 / 40 A Modello 1891 guns were mounted at the bow and stern and the remaining two or four 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns were positioned on the main deck between the 152 mm guns . The 20 @.@ 4 @-@ kilogram ( 45 lb ) armor @-@ piercing shell had a muzzle velocity of 645 m / s ( 2 @,@ 116 ft / s ) when fired by these guns . For defense against torpedo boats , the ships carried fourteen QF 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) Hotchkiss guns and six or eight QF 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns . They were also equipped with four 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . 
 The ships were protected by an armored belt that was 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick amidships and reduced to 11 cm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) at the bow and stern . The upper strake of armor was also 15 cm thick and protected just the middle of the ship , up to the height of the upper deck . The curved armored deck was 3 @.@ 7 cm thick . The conning tower armor was also 15 cm thick and each 15 @.@ 2 cm gun was protected by a 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) gun shield .

 Vettor Pisani was the flagship of Rear Admiral Candiani , commander of the Cruising Squadron dispatched to China in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion . She arrived at La Spezia in early 1902 , but only remained in Italian waters for a year before returning to the Far East for another year @-@ long cruise . 
 Carlo Alberto acted as the royal yacht for King Victor Emmanuel III when he attended the coronation ceremony for King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in 1902 . Victor Emmanuel invited Guglielmo Marconi to accompany him and conduct radio experiments en route . When the coronation was delayed by Edward 's illness , the ship took Victor Emmanuel to meetings with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in Kronstadt . She then ferried Marconi across the Atlantic to Nova Scotia for experiments transmitting radio messages across the ocean . After 15 December , when Marconi successfully transmitted messages from Canada to England , Carlo Alberto was sent to Venezuelan waters during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902 – 03 , when an international force of British , German , and Italian warships blockaded Venezuela over the country 's refusal to pay foreign debts . From 1907 to 1910 she served as a gunnery and torpedo training ship . 
 Both ships participated in the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 . Vettor Pisani supported operations in the Adriatic and Aegean Seas and in the Dardanelles while Carlo Alberto took part in the assaults on Tripoli and Zuara and thereafter provided gunfire support to Italian forces in North Africa . 
 Obsolescent by the beginning of World War I , neither ship was very active during the war . Vettor Pisani spent the war in the Adriatic and participated in an abortive attempt in mid @-@ 1915 to bombard a rail line near Ragusa Vecchia on the Dalmatian coast . An Austro @-@ Hungarian submarine , U @-@ 4 , intercepted the Italian ships and sank the armored cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi . Vettor Pisani subsequently became a repair ship in 1916 and was stricken from the Navy List on 2 January 1920 . She was sold for scrap and broken up beginning on 13 March . 
 Carlo Alberto spent the almost the entire war based in Venice . She began conversion into a troop transport there in 1917 and the work was finished in Taranto early the next year ; she was recommissioned with the new name of Zenson . The ship was discarded on 12 June 1920 and subsequently scrapped . 
 = Radius of maximum wind = 
 The radius of maximum wind ( RMW ) is the distance between the center of a cyclone and its band of strongest winds . It is a parameter in atmospheric dynamics and tropical cyclone forecasting . The highest rainfall rates occur near the RMW of tropical cyclones . The extent of a cyclone 's storm surge and its maximum potential intensity can be determined using the RMW . As maximum sustained winds increase , the RMW decreases . Recently , RMW has been used in descriptions of tornadoes . When designing buildings to prevent against failure from atmospheric pressure change , RMW can be used in the calculations . 
 = = Determination = = 
 The RMW is traditionally measured by reconnaissance aircraft in the Atlantic basin . It can also be determined on weather maps as the distance between the cyclone center and the system 's greatest pressure gradient . Using weather satellite data , the distance between the coldest cloud top temperature and the warmest <unk> within the eye , in infrared satellite imagery , is one method of determining RMW . The reason why this method has merit is that the strongest winds within tropical cyclones tend to be located under the deepest convection , which is seen on satellite imagery as the coldest cloud tops . Use of velocity data from Doppler weather radar can also be used to determine this quantity , both for tornadoes and tropical cyclones near the coast . 
 = = Tornadoes = = 
 In the case of tornadoes , knowledge of the RMW is important as atmospheric pressure change ( APC ) within sealed buildings can cause failure of the structure . Most buildings have openings totaling one square foot per 1 @,@ 000 @-@ cubic @-@ foot ( 28 m3 ) volume to help equalize air pressure between the inside and outside of the structures . The APC is around one @-@ half of its maximum value at the RMW , which normally ranges between 150 feet ( 46 m ) and 500 feet ( 150 m ) from the center ( or eye ) of the tornado . The widest tornado as measured by actual radar wind measurements was the Mulhall tornado in northern Oklahoma , part of the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak , which had a radius of maximum wind of over 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) . 
 = = Tropical cyclones = = 
 An average value for the RMW of 47 kilometres ( 29 mi ) was calculated as the mean ( or average ) of all hurricanes with a lowest central atmospheric pressure between a pressure of 909 hectopascals ( 26 @.@ 8 inHg ) and 993 hectopascals ( 29 @.@ 3 inHg ) . As tropical cyclones intensify , maximum sustained winds increase as the RMW decreases . The heaviest rainfall within intense tropical cyclones has been observed in the vicinity of the RMW . 
 The radius of maximum wind helps determine the direct strikes of tropical cyclones . Tropical cyclones are considered to have made a direct strike to a landmass when a tropical cyclone passes close enough to a landmass that areas inside the radius of maximum wind are experienced on land . The radius of maximum wind is used within the maximum potential intensity equation . The Emanuel equation for Maximum Intensity Potential relies upon the winds near the RMW of a tropical cyclone to determine its ultimate potential . 
 The highest storm surge is normally coincident with the radius of maximum wind . Because the strongest winds within a tropical cyclone lie at the RMW , this is the region of a tropical cyclone which generates the dominant waves near the storm , and ultimately ocean swell away from the cyclone . Tropical cyclones mix the ocean water within a radius three times that of the RMW , which lowers sea surface temperatures due to upwelling . 
 Much is still unknown about the radius of maximum wind in tropical cyclones , including whether or not it can be predictable . 
 = William Wilberforce = 
 William Wilberforce ( 24 August 1759 – 29 July 1833 ) was an English politician , philanthropist , and a leader of the movement to abolish the slave trade . A native of Kingston upon Hull , Yorkshire , he began his political career in 1780 , eventually becoming the independent Member of Parliament for Yorkshire ( 1784 – 1812 ) . In 1785 , he became an Evangelical Christian , which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform . 
 In 1787 , he came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti @-@ slave @-@ trade activists , including Granville Sharp , Hannah More and Charles Middleton . They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition , and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists . He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807 . 
 Wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion , morality and education . He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice , British missionary work in India , the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone , the foundation of the Church Mission Society , and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation , and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad . 
 In later years , Wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery , and continued his involvement after 1826 , when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health . That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 , which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire ; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured . He was buried in Westminster Abbey , close to his friend William Pitt . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Wilberforce was born in a house on the High Street of Hull , in the East Riding of Yorkshire : England , on 24 August 1759 , the only son of Robert Wilberforce ( 1728 – 68 ) , a wealthy merchant , and his wife Elizabeth Bird ( 1730 – 98 ) . His grandfather William ( 1690 – 1774 or 1776 ) had made the family fortune in the maritime trade with Baltic countries , and had twice been elected mayor of Hull . 
 Wilberforce was a small , sickly and delicate child , with poor eyesight . In 1767 he began attending Hull Grammar School , at the time headed by a young , dynamic headmaster , Joseph Milner , who was to become a lifelong friend . Wilberforce profited from the supportive atmosphere at the school until the death of his father in 1768 . With his mother struggling to cope , the nine @-@ year @-@ old Wilberforce was sent to a prosperous uncle and aunt with houses in both St James ' Place , London , and Wimbledon , at that time a village 7 miles ( 11 km ) south @-@ west of London . He attended an " indifferent " boarding school in Putney for two years , spending his holidays in Wimbledon , where he grew extremely fond of his relatives . He became interested in evangelical Christianity because of their influence , especially that of his aunt Hannah , sister of the wealthy Christian merchant John Thornton , a philanthropist and a supporter of the leading Methodist preacher George Whitefield . 
 Wilberforce 's staunchly Church of England mother and grandfather , alarmed at these nonconformist influences and at his leanings towards evangelicalism , brought the 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy back to Hull in 1771 . Wilberforce was heartbroken to be separated from his aunt and uncle . His family opposed a return to Hull Grammar School because the headmaster had become a Methodist ; Wilberforce therefore continued his education at nearby Pocklington School from 1771 to 1776 . Influenced by Methodist scruples , he initially resisted Hull 's lively social life , but as his religious fervour diminished , he embraced theatre @-@ going , attended balls and played cards . 
 In October 1776 , at the age of 17 , Wilberforce went up to St John 's College , Cambridge . The deaths of his grandfather and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy , and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study . Instead , he immersed himself in the social round of student life , and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards , gambling and late @-@ night drinking sessions — although he found the excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful . Witty , generous , and an excellent conversationalist , Wilberforce was a popular figure . He made many friends , including the more studious future Prime Minister , William Pitt . Despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying , he managed to pass his examinations , and was awarded a B.A. in 1781 and an M.A. in 1788 . 
 = = Early parliamentary career = = 
 Wilberforce began to consider a political career while still at university , and during the winter of 1779 – 80 , he and Pitt frequently watched House of Commons debates from the gallery . Pitt , already set on a political career , encouraged Wilberforce to join him in obtaining a parliamentary seat . In September 1780 , at the age of twenty @-@ one and while still a student , Wilberforce was elected Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Kingston upon Hull , spending over £ 8 @,@ 000 to ensure he received the necessary votes , as was the custom of the time . Free from financial pressures , Wilberforce sat as an independent , resolving to be " no party man " . Criticised at times for inconsistency , he supported both Tory and Whig governments according to his conscience , working closely with the party in power , and voting on specific measures according to their merits . 
 Wilberforce attended Parliament regularly , but he also maintained a lively social life , becoming an habitué of gentlemen 's gambling clubs such as <unk> 's and Boodle 's in Pall Mall , London . The writer and socialite Madame de Staël described him as the " wittiest man in England " and , according to Georgiana , Duchess of Devonshire , the Prince of Wales said that he would go anywhere to hear Wilberforce sing . 
 Wilberforce used his speaking voice to great effect in political speeches ; the diarist and author James Boswell witnessed Wilberforce 's eloquence in the House of Commons and noted , " I saw what seemed a mere shrimp mount upon the table ; but as I listened , he grew , and grew , until the shrimp became a whale . " During the frequent government changes of 1781 – 84 , Wilberforce supported his friend Pitt in parliamentary debates . 
 In autumn 1783 , Pitt , Wilberforce and Edward Eliot ( later to become Pitt 's brother @-@ in @-@ law ) , travelled to France for a six @-@ week holiday together . After a difficult start in Rheims , where their presence aroused police suspicion that they were English spies , they visited Paris , meeting Benjamin Franklin , General Lafayette , Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI , and joined the French court at Fontainebleau . 
 Pitt became Prime Minister in December 1783 , with Wilberforce a key supporter of his minority government . Despite their close friendship , there is no record that Pitt offered Wilberforce a ministerial position in this or future governments . This may have been due to Wilberforce 's wish to remain an independent MP . Alternatively , Wilberforce 's frequent tardiness and disorganisation , as well as the chronic eye problems that at times made reading impossible , may have convinced Pitt that his trusted friend was not ministerial material . When Parliament was dissolved in the spring of 1784 , Wilberforce decided to stand as a candidate for the county of Yorkshire in the 1784 general election . On 6 April , he was returned as MP for Yorkshire at the age of twenty @-@ four . 
 = = Conversion = = 
 In October 1784 , Wilberforce embarked upon a tour of Europe which would ultimately change his life and determine his future career . He travelled with his mother and sister in the company of Isaac Milner , the brilliant younger brother of his former headmaster , who had been Fellow of Queens ' College , Cambridge , in the year when Wilberforce first went up . They visited the French Riviera and enjoyed the usual pastimes of dinners , cards , and gambling . In February 1785 , Wilberforce returned to the United Kingdom temporarily , to support Pitt 's proposals for parliamentary reforms . He rejoined the party in Genoa , Italy , from where they continued their tour to Switzerland . Milner accompanied Wilberforce to England , and on the journey they read The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul by Philip Doddridge , a leading early 18th @-@ century English nonconformist . 
 Wilberforce 's spiritual journey is thought to have begun at this time . He started to rise early to read the Bible and pray and kept a private journal . He underwent an evangelical conversion , regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work to the service of God . His conversion changed some of his habits , but not his nature : he remained outwardly cheerful , interested and respectful , tactfully urging others towards his new faith . <unk> , he underwent an agonising struggle and became relentlessly self @-@ critical , harshly judging his spirituality , use of time , vanity , self @-@ control and relationships with others . 
 At the time , religious enthusiasm was generally regarded as a social transgression and was stigmatised in polite society . Evangelicals in the upper classes , such as Sir Richard Hill , the Methodist MP for Shropshire , and Selina Hastings , Countess of Huntingdon , were exposed to contempt and ridicule , and Wilberforce 's conversion led him to question whether he should remain in public life . He sought guidance from John Newton , a leading Evangelical Anglican clergyman of the day and Rector of St Mary Woolnoth in the City of London . Both Newton and Pitt counselled him to remain in politics , and he resolved to do so " with increased diligence and conscientiousness " . Thereafter , his political views were informed by his faith and by his desire to promote Christianity and Christian ethics in private and public life . His views were often deeply conservative , opposed to radical changes in a God @-@ given political and social order , and focused on issues such as the observance of the Sabbath and the eradication of immorality through education and reform . As a result , he was often distrusted by progressive voices because of his conservatism , and regarded with suspicion by many Tories who saw Evangelicals as radicals , bent on the overthrow of church and state . 
 In 1786 , Wilberforce leased a house in Old Palace Yard , Westminster , in order to be near Parliament . He began using his parliamentary position to advocate reform by introducing a Registration Bill , proposing limited changes to parliamentary election procedures . He brought forward a bill to extend the measure permitting the dissection after execution of criminals such as rapists , arsonists and thieves . The bill also advocated the reduction of sentences for women convicted of treason , a crime that at the time included a husband 's murder . The House of Commons passed both bills , but they were defeated in the House of Lords . 
 = = Abolition of the slave trade = = 
 = = = Initial decision = = = 
 The British initially became involved in the slave trade during the 16th century . By 1783 , the triangular route that took British @-@ made goods to Africa to buy slaves , transported the enslaved to the West Indies , and then brought slave @-@ grown products such as sugar , tobacco , and cotton to Britain , represented about 80 percent of Great Britain 's foreign income . British ships dominated the trade , supplying French , Spanish , Dutch , Portuguese and British colonies , and in peak years carried forty thousand enslaved men , women and children across the Atlantic in the horrific conditions of the middle passage . Of the estimated 11 million Africans transported into slavery , about 1 @.@ 4 million died during the voyage . 
 The British campaign to abolish the slave trade is generally considered to have begun in the 1780s with the establishment of the Quakers ' antislavery committees , and their presentation to Parliament of the first slave trade petition in 1783 . The same year , Wilberforce , while dining with his old Cambridge friend Gerard Edwards , met Rev. James Ramsay , a ship 's surgeon who had become a clergyman on the island of St Christopher ( later St Kitts ) in the Leeward Islands , and a medical supervisor of the plantations there . What Ramsay had witnessed of the conditions endured by the slaves , both at sea and on the plantations , horrified him . Returning to England after fifteen years , he accepted the living of Teston , Kent in 1781 , and there met Sir Charles Middleton , Lady Middleton , Thomas Clarkson , Hannah More and others , a group that later became known as the <unk> . Interested in promoting Christianity and moral improvement in Britain and overseas , they were appalled by Ramsay 's reports of the depraved lifestyles of slave owners , the cruel treatment meted out to the enslaved , and the lack of Christian instruction provided to the slaves . With their encouragement and help , Ramsay spent three years writing An essay on the treatment and conversion of African slaves in the British sugar colonies , which was highly critical of slavery in the West Indies . The book , published in 1784 , was to have an important impact in raising public awareness and interest , and it excited the ire of West Indian planters who in the coming years attacked both Ramsay and his ideas in a series of pro @-@ slavery tracts . 
 Wilberforce apparently did not follow up on his meeting with Ramsay . However , three years later , and inspired by his new faith , Wilberforce was growing interested in humanitarian reform . In November 1786 , he received a letter from Sir Charles Middleton that re @-@ opened his interest in the slave trade . At the urging of Lady Middleton , Sir Charles suggested that Wilberforce bring forward the abolition of the slave trade in Parliament . Wilberforce responded that he " felt the great importance of the subject , and thought himself unequal to the task allotted to him , but yet would not positively decline it " . He began to read widely on the subject , and met with the <unk> at Middleton 's home at Barham Court in Teston in the early winter of 1786 – 87 . 
 In early 1787 , Thomas Clarkson , a fellow graduate of St John 's , Cambridge , who had become convinced of the need to end the slave trade after writing a prize @-@ winning essay on the subject while at Cambridge , called upon Wilberforce at Old Palace Yard with a published copy of the work . This was the first time the two men had met ; their collaboration would last nearly fifty years . Clarkson began to visit Wilberforce on a weekly basis , bringing first @-@ hand evidence he had obtained about the slave trade . The Quakers , already working for abolition , also recognised the need for influence within Parliament , and urged Clarkson to secure a commitment from Wilberforce to bring forward the case for abolition in the House of Commons . 
 It was arranged that Bennet Langton , a Lincolnshire landowner and mutual acquaintance of Wilberforce and Clarkson , would organize a dinner party in order to ask Wilberforce formally to lead the parliamentary campaign . The dinner took place on 13 March 1787 ; other guests included Charles Middleton , Sir Joshua Reynolds , William Windham , MP , James Boswell and Isaac Hawkins Browne , MP . By the end of the evening , Wilberforce had agreed in general terms that he would bring forward the abolition of the slave trade in Parliament , " provided that no person more proper could be found " . 
 The same spring , on 12 May 1787 , the still hesitant Wilberforce held a conversation with William Pitt and the future Prime Minister William Grenville as they sat under a large oak tree on Pitt 's estate in Kent . Under what came to be known as the " Wilberforce Oak " at <unk> , Pitt challenged his friend : " Wilberforce , why don 't you give notice of a motion on the subject of the Slave Trade ? You have already taken great pains to collect evidence , and are therefore fully entitled to the credit which doing so will ensure you . Do not lose time , or the ground will be occupied by another . " Wilberforce 's response is not recorded , but he later declared in old age that he could " distinctly remember the very knoll on which I was sitting near Pitt and Grenville " where he made his decision . 
 Wilberforce 's involvement in the abolition movement was motivated by a desire to put his Christian principles into action and to serve God in public life . He and other Evangelicals were horrified by what they perceived was a depraved and unchristian trade , and the greed and avarice of the owners and traders . Wilberforce sensed a call from God , writing in a journal entry in 1787 that " God Almighty has set before me two great objects , the suppression of the Slave Trade and the Reformation of Manners [ moral values ] " . The conspicuous involvement of Evangelicals in the highly popular anti @-@ slavery movement served to improve the status of a group otherwise associated with the less popular campaigns against vice and immorality . 
 = = = Early parliamentary action = = = 
 On 22 May 1787 , the first meeting of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade took place , bringing like @-@ minded British Quakers and Anglicans together in the same organisation for the first time . The committee chose to campaign against the slave trade rather than slavery itself , with many members believing that slavery would eventually disappear as a natural consequence of the abolition of the trade . Wilberforce , though involved informally , did not join the committee officially until 1791 . 
 The society was highly successful in raising public awareness and support , and local chapters sprang up throughout Great Britain . Clarkson travelled the country researching and collecting first @-@ hand testimony and statistics , while the committee promoted the campaign , pioneering techniques such as lobbying , writing pamphlets , holding public meetings , gaining press attention , organising boycotts and even using a campaign logo : an image of a kneeling slave above the motto " Am I not a Man and a Brother ? " , designed by the renowned pottery @-@ maker Josiah Wedgwood . The committee also sought to influence slave @-@ trading nations such as France , Spain , Portugal , Denmark , Holland and the United States , corresponding with anti @-@ slavery activists in other countries and organising the translation of English @-@ language books and pamphlets . These included books by former slaves <unk> <unk> and Olaudah Equiano , who had published influential works on slavery and the slave trade in 1787 and 1789 respectively . They and other free blacks , collectively known as " Sons of Africa " , spoke at debating societies and wrote spirited letters to newspapers , periodicals and prominent figures , as well as public letters of support to campaign allies . Hundreds of parliamentary petitions opposing the slave trade were received in 1788 and following years , with hundreds of thousands of signatories in total . The campaign proved to be the world 's first grassroots human rights campaign , in which men and women from different social classes and backgrounds volunteered to try to end the injustices suffered by others . 
 Wilberforce had planned to introduce a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session . However , in January 1788 , he was taken ill with a probable stress @-@ related condition , now thought to be ulcerative colitis . It was several months before he was able to resume work , and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge . His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium , which proved effective in alleviating his condition , and which he continued to use for the rest of his life . 
 In Wilberforce 's absence , Pitt , who had long been supportive of abolition , introduced the preparatory motion himself , and ordered a Privy Council investigation into the slave trade , followed by a House of Commons review . 
 With the publication of the Privy Council report in April 1789 and following months of planning , Wilberforce commenced his parliamentary campaign . On 12 May 1789 , he made his first major speech on the subject of abolition in the House of Commons , in which he reasoned that the trade was morally reprehensible and an issue of natural justice . Drawing on Thomas Clarkson 's mass of evidence , he described in detail the appalling conditions in which slaves travelled from Africa in the middle passage , and argued that abolishing the trade would also bring an improvement to the conditions of existing slaves in the West Indies . He moved 12 resolutions condemning the slave trade , but made no reference to the abolition of slavery itself , instead dwelling on the potential for reproduction in the existing slave population should the trade be abolished . With the tide running against them , the opponents of abolition delayed the vote by proposing that the House of Commons hear its own evidence , and Wilberforce , in a move that has subsequently been criticised for prolonging the slave trade , reluctantly agreed . The hearings were not completed by the end of the parliamentary session , and were deferred until the following year . In the meantime , Wilberforce and Clarkson tried unsuccessfully to take advantage of the egalitarian atmosphere of the French Revolution to press for France 's abolition of the trade , which was , in any event , to be abolished in 1794 as a result of the bloody slave revolt in St. Domingue ( later to be known as Haiti ) , although later briefly restored by Napoleon in 1802 . 
 In January 1790 , Wilberforce succeeded in speeding up the hearings by gaining approval for a smaller parliamentary select committee to consider the vast quantity of evidence which had been accumulated . Wilberforce 's house in Old Palace Yard became a centre for the abolitionists ' campaign and a focus for many strategy meetings . Petitioners for other causes also besieged him there , and his ante @-@ room was thronged from an early hour , like " Noah 's Ark , full of beasts clean and unclean " , according to Hannah More . 
 Interrupted by a general election in June 1790 , the committee finally finished hearing witnesses , and in April 1791 with a closely reasoned four @-@ hour speech , Wilberforce introduced the first parliamentary bill to abolish the slave trade . However , after two evenings of debate , the bill was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88 , the political climate having swung in a conservative direction in the wake of the French Revolution and in reaction to an increase in radicalism and to slave revolts in the French West Indies . Such was the public hysteria of the time that even Wilberforce himself was suspected by some of being a Jacobin agitator . 
 This was the beginning of a protracted parliamentary campaign , during which Wilberforce 's commitment never wavered , despite frustration and hostility . He was supported in his work by fellow members of the so @-@ called Clapham Sect , among whom was his best friend and cousin Henry Thornton . Holding evangelical Christian convictions , and consequently dubbed " the Saints " , the group mainly lived in large houses surrounding the common in Clapham , then a village to the south @-@ west of London . Wilberforce accepted an invitation to share a house with Henry Thornton in 1792 , moving into his own home after Thornton 's marriage in 1796 . The " Saints " were an informal community , characterised by considerable intimacy as well as a commitment to practical Christianity and an opposition to slavery . They developed a relaxed family atmosphere , wandering freely in and out of each other 's homes and gardens , and discussing the many religious , social and political topics that engaged them . 
 Pro @-@ slavery advocates claimed that enslaved Africans were lesser human beings who benefited from their bondage . Wilberforce , the Clapham Sect and others were anxious to demonstrate that Africans , and particularly freed slaves , had human and economic abilities beyond the slave trade , and that they were capable of sustaining a well @-@ ordered society , trade and cultivation . Inspired in part by the utopian vision of Granville Sharp , they became involved in the establishment in 1792 of a free colony in Sierra Leone with black settlers from the United Kingdom , Nova Scotia and Jamaica , as well as native Africans and some whites . They formed the Sierra Leone Company , with Wilberforce subscribing liberally to the project in money and time . The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms ; the reality was fraught with tension , crop failures , disease , death , war and defections to the slave trade . Initially a commercial venture , the British government assumed responsibility for the colony in 1808 . The colony , although troubled at times , was to become a symbol of anti @-@ slavery in which residents , communities and African tribal chiefs , worked together to prevent enslavement at the source , supported by a British naval blockade to stem the region 's slave trade . 
 On 2 April 1792 , Wilberforce again brought a bill calling for abolition . The memorable debate that followed drew contributions from the greatest orators in the house , William Pitt and Charles James Fox , as well as from Wilberforce himself . Lord Melville , as Home Secretary , proposed a compromise solution of so @-@ called " gradual abolition " over a number of years . This was passed by 230 to 85 votes , but the compromise was little more than a clever ploy , with the intention of ensuring that total abolition would be delayed indefinitely . 
 = = = War with France = = = 
 On 26 February 1793 , another vote to abolish the slave trade was narrowly defeated by eight votes . The outbreak of war with France the same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of the issue , as politicians concentrated on the national crisis and the threat of invasion . The same year , and again in 1794 , Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies . He voiced his concern about the war and urged Pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities . Growing more alarmed , on 31 December 1794 , Wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with France , a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt . 
 Abolition continued to be associated in the public consciousness with the French Revolution and with British radical groups , resulting in a decline in public support . In 1795 , the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade ceased to meet , and Clarkson retired in ill @-@ health to the Lake District . However , despite the decreased interest in abolition , Wilberforce continued to introduce abolition bills throughout the 1790s . 
 The early years of the 19th century once again saw an increased public interest in abolition . Since Napoleon had reintroduced slavery in the French colonies , support of abolition was no longer perceived as being pro @-@ French . 
 In 1804 , Clarkson resumed his work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again , strengthened with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay , Henry Brougham and James Stephen . In June 1804 , Wilberforce 's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons . However , it was too late in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords . On its reintroduction during the 1805 session , it was defeated , with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it . On this occasion and throughout the campaign , abolition was held back by Wilberforce 's trusting , even credulous nature , and his deferential attitude towards those in power . He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing , and was reluctant to confront them when they did not . 
 = = = Final phase of the campaign = = = 
 Following Pitt 's death in January 1806 , Wilberforce began to collaborate more with the Whigs , especially the abolitionists . He gave general support to the Grenville – Fox administration , which brought more abolitionists into the cabinet ; Wilberforce and Charles Fox led the campaign in the House of Commons , while Lord Grenville advocated the cause in the House of Lords . 
 A radical change of tactics , which involved the introduction of a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies , was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen . It was a shrewd move , since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war . A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet , and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self @-@ imposed silence , so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill . The approach proved successful , and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed , and received royal assent on 23 May 1806 . Wilberforce and Clarkson had collected a large volume of evidence against the slave trade over the previous two decades , and Wilberforce spent the latter part of 1806 writing A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade , which was a comprehensive restatement of the abolitionists ' case . The death of Fox in September 1806 was a blow , and was followed quickly by a general election in the autumn of 1806 . Slavery became an election issue , bringing more abolitionist MPs into the House of Commons , including former military men who had personally experienced the horrors of slavery and slave revolts . Wilberforce was re @-@ elected as an MP for Yorkshire , after which he returned to finishing and publishing his Letter , in reality a 400 @-@ page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign . 
 Lord Grenville , the Prime Minister , was determined to introduce an Abolition Bill in the House of Lords , rather than in the House of Commons , taking it through its greatest challenge first . When a final vote was taken , the bill was passed in the House of Lords by a large margin . Sensing a breakthrough that had been long anticipated , Charles Grey moved for a second reading in the Commons on 23 February 1807 . As tributes were made to Wilberforce , whose face streamed with tears , the bill was carried by 283 votes to 16 . Excited supporters suggested taking advantage of the large majority to seek the abolition of slavery itself , but Wilberforce made it clear that total emancipation was not the immediate goal : " They had for the present no object immediately before them , but that of putting stop directly to the carrying of men in British ships to be sold as slaves . " The Slave Trade Act received royal assent on 25 March 1807 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 In his youth , Wilberforce showed little interest in women , but in his late thirties , twenty @-@ year @-@ old Barbara Ann Spooner ( 1777 – 1847 ) was recommended by his friend Thomas Babington as a potential bride . Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797 , and was immediately smitten ; following an eight @-@ day whirlwind romance , he proposed . Despite the urgings of friends to slow down , the couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath , Somerset , on 30 May 1797 . They were devoted to each other , and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health , though she showed little interest in his political activities . They had six children in fewer than ten years : William ( b . 1798 ) , Barbara ( b . 1799 ) , Elizabeth ( b . 1801 ) , Robert Isaac Wilberforce ( b . 1802 ) , Samuel Wilberforce ( b . 1805 ) and Henry William Wilberforce ( b . 1807 ) . Wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at play with his children . 
 = = Other concerns = = 
 = = = Political and social reform = = = 
 Wilberforce was deeply conservative when it came to challenges to the existing political and social order . He advocated change in society through Christianity and improvement in morals , education and religion , fearing and opposing radical causes and revolution . The radical writer William Cobbett was among those who attacked what they saw as Wilberforce 's hypocrisy in campaigning for better working conditions for slaves while British workers lived in terrible conditions at home . " Never have you done one single act , in favour of the labourers of this country " , he wrote . Critics noted Wilberforce 's support of the suspension of habeas corpus in 1795 and his votes for Pitt 's " <unk> Bills " , which banned meetings of more than 50 people , allowing speakers to be arrested and imposing harsh penalties on those who attacked the constitution . Wilberforce was opposed to giving workers ' rights to organise into unions , in 1799 speaking in favour of the Combination Act , which suppressed trade union activity throughout the United Kingdom , and calling unions " a general disease in our society " . He also opposed an enquiry into the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in which eleven protesters were killed at a political rally demanding reform . Concerned about " bad men who wished to produce anarchy and confusion " , he approved of the government 's Six Acts , which further limited public meetings and seditious writings . Wilberforce 's actions led the essayist William Hazlitt to condemn him as one " who preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages , and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states . " 
 Wilberforce 's views of women and religion were also conservative . He disapproved of women anti @-@ slavery activists such as Elizabeth <unk> , who organised women 's abolitionist groups in the 1820s , protesting : " [ F ] or ladies to meet , to publish , to go from house to house stirring up petitions – these appear to me proceedings unsuited to the female character as delineated in Scripture . " Wilberforce initially strongly opposed bills for Catholic emancipation , which would have allowed Catholics to become MPs , hold public office and serve in the army , although by 1813 , he had changed his views and spoke in favour of a similar bill . 
 More progressively , Wilberforce advocated legislation to improve the working conditions for chimney @-@ sweeps and textile workers , engaged in prison reform , and supported campaigns to restrict capital punishment and the severe punishments meted out under the Game Laws . He recognised the importance of education in alleviating poverty , and when Hannah More and her sister established Sunday schools for the poor in Somerset and the Mendips , he provided financial and moral support as they faced opposition from landowners and Anglican clergy . From the late 1780s onward , Wilberforce campaigned for limited parliamentary reform , such as the abolition of rotten boroughs and the redistribution of Commons seats to growing towns and cities , though by 1832 , he feared that such measures went too far . With others , Wilberforce founded the world 's first animal welfare organisation , the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( later the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ) . In 1824 , Wilberforce was one of over 30 eminent gentlemen who put their names at the inaugural public meeting to the fledgling National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck , later named the Royal National Lifeboat Institution . He was also opposed to duelling , which he described as the " disgrace of a Christian society " and was appalled when his friend Pitt engaged in a duel in 1798 , particularly as it occurred on a Sunday , the Christian day of rest . 
 Wilberforce was generous with his time and money , believing that those with wealth had a duty to give a significant portion of their income to the needy . Yearly , he gave away thousands of pounds , much of it to clergymen to distribute in their parishes . He paid off the debts of others , supported education and missions , and in a year of food shortages , gave to charity more than his own yearly income . He was exceptionally hospitable , and could not bear to sack any of his servants . As a result , his home was full of old and incompetent servants kept on in charity . Although he was often months behind in his correspondence , Wilberforce responded to numerous requests for advice or for help in obtaining professorships , military promotions and livings for clergymen , or for the reprieve of death sentences . 
 = = = Evangelical Christianity = = = 
 A supporter of the evangelical wing of the Church of England , Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance would lead to a harmonious , moral society . He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life , making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle @-@ classes of society . To this end , in April 1797 , Wilberforce published A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of <unk> Christians in the Higher and Middle Classes of This Country Contrasted With Real Christianity , on which he had been working since 1793 . This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity , as a response to the moral decline of the nation , illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him . The book proved to be influential and a best @-@ seller by the standards of the day ; 7 @,@ 500 copies were sold within six months , and it was translated into several languages . 
 Wilberforce fostered and supported missionary activity in Britain and abroad . He was a founding member of the Church Missionary Society ( since renamed the Church Mission Society ) and was involved , with other members of the Clapham Sect , in numerous other evangelical and charitable organisations . Horrified by the lack of Christian evangelism in India , Wilberforce used the 1793 renewal of the British East India Company 's charter to propose the addition of clauses requiring the company to provide teachers and chaplains and to commit to the " religious improvement " of Indians . The plan was unsuccessful due to lobbying by the directors of the company , who feared that their commercial interests would be damaged . Wilberforce tried again in 1813 , when the charter next came up for renewal . Using petitions , meetings , lobbying and letter writing , he successfully campaigned for changes to the charter . Speaking in favour of the Charter Act 1813 , he criticised the British in India for their hypocrisy and racial prejudice , while also condemning aspects of Hinduism including the caste system , infanticide , polygamy and <unk> . " Our religion is sublime , pure beneficent " , he said , " theirs is mean , licentious and cruel " . 
 = = = Moral reform = = = 
 Greatly concerned by what he perceived to be the degeneracy of British society , Wilberforce was also active in matters of moral reform , lobbying against " the torrent of <unk> that every day makes more rapid advances " , and considered this issue and the abolition of the slave trade as equally important goals . At the suggestion of Wilberforce and Bishop <unk> , King George III was requested by the Archbishop of Canterbury to issue in 1787 the Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice , as a remedy for the rising tide of immorality . The proclamation commanded the prosecution of those guilty of " excessive drinking , blasphemy , profane swearing and cursing , lewdness , profanation of the Lord 's Day , and other dissolute , immoral , or disorderly practices " . Greeted largely with public indifference , Wilberforce sought to increase its impact by mobilising public figures to the cause , and by founding the Society for the Suppression of Vice . This and other societies in which Wilberforce was a prime mover , such as the Proclamation Society , mustered support for the prosecution of those who had been charged with violating relevant laws , including brothel keepers , distributors of pornographic material , and those who did not respect the Sabbath . Years later , the writer and clergyman Sydney Smith criticised Wilberforce for being more interested in the sins of the poor than those of the rich , and suggested that a better name would have been the Society for " suppressing the vices of persons whose income does not exceed £ 500 per annum " . The societies were not highly successful in terms of membership and support , although their activities did lead to the imprisonment of Thomas Williams , the London printer of Thomas Paine 's The Age of Reason . Wilberforce 's attempts to legislate against adultery and Sunday newspapers were also in vain ; his involvement and leadership in other , less punitive , approaches were more successful in the long @-@ term , however . By the end of his life , British morals , manners , and sense of social responsibility had increased , paving the way for future changes in societal conventions and attitudes during the Victorian era . 
 = = = Emancipation of enslaved Africans = = = 
 The hopes of the abolitionists notwithstanding , slavery did not wither with the end of the slave trade in the British Empire , nor did the living conditions of the enslaved improve . The trade continued , with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade , and with some British ships disregarding the legislation . Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries . In particular , the US had abolished the slave trade in 1808 , and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly . 
 The same year , Wilberforce moved his family from Clapham to a sizeable mansion with a large garden in Kensington Gore , closer to the Houses of Parliament . Never strong , and by 1812 in worsening health , Wilberforce resigned his Yorkshire seat , and became MP for the rotten borough of Bramber in Sussex , a seat with little or no constituency obligations , thus allowing him more time for his family and the causes that interested him . From 1816 Wilberforce introduced a series of bills which would require the compulsory registration of slaves , together with details of their country of origin , permitting the illegal importation of foreign slaves to be detected . Later in the same year he began publicly to denounce slavery itself , though he did not demand immediate emancipation , as " They had always thought the slaves incapable of liberty at present , but hoped that by degrees a change might take place as the natural result of the abolition . " 
 In 1820 , after a period of poor health , and with his eyesight failing , Wilberforce took the decision to further limit his public activities , although he became embroiled in unsuccessful mediation attempts between King George IV , and his estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick , who had sought her rights as queen . Nevertheless , Wilberforce still hoped " to lay a foundation for some future measures for the emancipation of the poor slaves " , which he believed should come about gradually in stages . Aware that the cause would need younger men to continue the work , in 1821 he asked fellow MP Thomas Fowell Buxton to take over leadership of the campaign in the Commons . As the 1820s wore on , Wilberforce increasingly became a figurehead for the abolitionist movement , although he continued to appear at anti @-@ slavery meetings , welcoming visitors , and maintaining a busy correspondence on the subject . 
 The year 1823 saw the founding of the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery ( later the Anti @-@ Slavery Society ) , and the publication of Wilberforce 's 56 @-@ page Appeal to the Religion , Justice and Humanity of the Inhabitants of the British Empire in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies . In his treatise , Wilberforce urged that total emancipation was morally and ethically required , and that slavery was a national crime that must be ended by parliamentary legislation to gradually abolish slavery . Members of Parliament did not quickly agree , and government opposition in March 1823 stymied Wilberforce 's call for abolition . On 15 May 1823 , Buxton moved another resolution in Parliament for gradual emancipation . Subsequent debates followed on 16 March and 11 June 1824 in which Wilberforce made his last speeches in the Commons , and which again saw the <unk> outmanoeuvred by the government . 
 = = Last years = = 
 Wilberforce 's health was continuing to fail , and he suffered further illnesses in 1824 and 1825 . With his family concerned that his life was endangered , he declined a peerage and resigned his seat in Parliament , leaving the campaign in the hands of others . Thomas Clarkson continued to travel , visiting anti @-@ slavery groups throughout Britain , motivating activists and acting as an ambassador for the anti @-@ slavery cause to other countries , while Buxton pursued the cause of reform in Parliament . Public meetings and petitions demanding emancipation continued , with an increasing number supporting immediate abolition rather than the gradual approach favoured by Wilberforce , Clarkson and their colleagues . 
 In 1826 , Wilberforce moved from his large house in Kensington Gore to Highwood Hill , a more modest property in the countryside of Mill Hill , north of London , where he was soon joined by his son William and family . William had attempted a series of educational and career paths , and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses , which his father repaid in full , despite offers from others to assist . This left Wilberforce with little income , and he was obliged to let his home and spend the rest of his life visiting family members and friends . He continued his support for the anti @-@ slavery cause , including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti @-@ Slavery Society . 
 Wilberforce approved of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs , though he was concerned about the implications of their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise . In the event , the Reform Act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery . In addition , the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion . In 1833 , Wilberforce 's health declined further and he suffered a severe attack of influenza from which he never fully recovered . He made a final anti @-@ slavery speech in April 1833 at a public meeting in Maidstone , Kent . The following month , the Whig government introduced the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery , formally saluting Wilberforce in the process . On 26 July 1833 , Wilberforce heard of government concessions that guaranteed the passing of the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery . The following day he grew much weaker , and he died early on the morning of 29 July at his cousin 's house in Cadogan Place , London . 
 One month later , the House of Lords passed the Slavery Abolition Act , which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire from August 1834 . They voted plantation owners £ 20 million in compensation , giving full emancipation to children younger than six , and instituting a system of apprenticeship requiring other enslaved peoples to work for their former masters for four to six years in the British West Indies , South Africa , Mauritius , British Honduras and Canada . Nearly 800 @,@ 000 African slaves were freed , the vast majority in the Caribbean . 
 = = = Funeral = = = 
 Wilberforce had requested that he was to be buried with his sister and daughter at Stoke Newington , just north of London . However , the leading members of both Houses of Parliament urged that he be honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey . The family agreed and , on 3 August 1833 , Wilberforce was buried in the north transept , close to his friend William Pitt . The funeral was attended by many Members of Parliament , as well as by members of the public . The pallbearers included the Duke of Gloucester , the Lord Chancellor Henry Brougham and the Speaker of the House of Commons Charles Manners @-@ Sutton . While tributes were paid and Wilberforce was laid to rest , both Houses of Parliament suspended their business as a mark of respect . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Five years after his death , sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce published a five @-@ volume biography about their father , and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840 . The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce 's role in the abolition movement and played down the important work of Thomas Clarkson . Incensed , Clarkson came out of retirement to write a book refuting their version of events , and the sons eventually made a half @-@ hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography . However , for more than a century , Wilberforce 's role in the campaign dominated the history books . Later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between Clarkson and Wilberforce , and have termed it one of history 's great partnerships : without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson , abolition could not have been achieved . 
 As his sons had desired and planned , Wilberforce has long been viewed as a Christian hero , a statesman @-@ saint held up as a role model for putting his faith into action . More broadly , he has also been described as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action . In the 1940s , the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams , who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics , as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline . Williams ' approach strongly influenced historians for much of the latter part of the 20th century . However , more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition , and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals , as well as a recognition of the anti @-@ slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 Wilberforce 's life and work have been commemorated in the United Kingdom and elsewhere . In Westminster Abbey , a seated statue of Wilberforce by Samuel Joseph was erected in 1840 , bearing an epitaph praising his Christian character and his long labour to abolish the slave trade and slavery itself . 
 In Wilberforce 's home town of Hull , a public subscription in 1834 funded the Wilberforce Monument , a 31 @-@ metre ( 102 ft ) Greek Doric column topped by a statue of Wilberforce , which now stands in the grounds of Hull College near Queen 's Gardens . Wilberforce 's birthplace was acquired by the city corporation in 1903 and , following renovation , Wilberforce House in Hull was opened as Britain 's first slavery museum . Wilberforce Memorial School for the Blind in York was established in 1833 in his honour , and in 2006 the University of Hull established the Wilberforce Institute for the study of Slavery and Emancipation in Oriel Chambers , a building adjoining Wilberforce 's birthplace . Various churches within the Anglican Communion commemorate Wilberforce in their liturgical calendars , and Wilberforce University in Ohio , United States , founded in 1856 , is named after him . The university was the first owned by African @-@ American people , and is a historically black college . In Ontario , Canada , Wilberforce Colony was founded by black reformers , and inhabited by free slaves from the United States . 
 Amazing Grace , a film about Wilberforce and the struggle against the slave trade , directed by Michael Apted and starring Ioan Gruffudd and Benedict Cumberbatch was released in 2007 to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Parliament 's anti @-@ slave trade legislation .

 Clover is the production name given to the giant monster and the main antagonist in the 2008 film Cloverfield . The creature was originally conceived by producer J. J. Abrams and was designed by artist Neville Page . In the film , the monster 's name is never mentioned ; the name " Cloverfield " is only given to the US Department of Defense case file of the incidents depicted in the film .

However , Tagruato and Slusho ! have two different official websites . 
 = = Concept and creation = = 
 J. J. Abrams conceived of a new monster after he and his son visited a toy store in Japan while promoting Mission : Impossible III . He explained , " We saw all these Godzilla toys , and I thought , we need our own [ American ] monster , and not like King Kong , King Kong 's adorable . But I wanted something that was just insane and intense " . 
 The monster was designed by artist Neville Page . He sought a biological rationale for the creature , though many of his ideas would not show up on screen . Page designed the creature as immature and suffering from " separation anxiety " . He compared the creature to a rampaging elephant , saying " there 's nothing scarier than something huge that 's spooked " . Page said of the creature 's backstory , " For me , one of the most key moments in our collective brainstorming was the choice to make the creature be something that we would empathize with . It is not out there just killing . It is confused , lost , scared . It 's a newborn . Having this be a story point ( one that the audience does not know ) , it allowed for some purposeful choices about its anatomy , movement and , yes , motivations " . The creature was developed by visual effects supervisor Kevin Blank and Phil Tippett 's company Tippett Studio . Blank described the intended goal of the creature , " Rather than the monster having a personality [ like Godzilla or King Kong ] , it 's more of an entity or an event " . 
 Reeves described the creature 's reaction to its surroundings thus : " It ’ s this new environment that it finds frightening " . To indicate this , Reeves suggested the addition of white in the creature 's eyes so it would look similar to a spooked horse . The filmmakers generated and used the idea of parasites because the film could not realistically have scenes between the human protagonists and the enormous creature . 
 = = = Creature design = = = 
 Although conceived by the film 's creators as infantile , the creature is 25 stories tall ( compared as 240 – 300 feet , or 70 – 90 meters ) and withstands missiles , artillery shells , and bombs with minimal injury . 
 It is vaguely quadrupedal , though capable of standing upright over short distances . The limbs are comparatively long and thin compared with the body core , and according to creator Neville Page , this , coupled with its quadrupedal stance , is meant to imply that it is a newborn : he speculates that the adults may be bipedal . The forelimbs are large in proportion to the body , and the hind legs stubby . The creature 's head at first glance appears to be a solid sphere ; but it can open its mouth extremely wide . Above the eyes on either side of the head are fleshy pouches which it inflates when agitated . 
 The creature 's design includes appendages on its underbelly , described by Neville Page as an " elongated , and articulated external esophagus with the business end terminating in <unk> fingers " . They were designed to relate the scale of human prey to the huge scale of the creature . The scenes from the film where people were consumed by these appendages were cut from the final edit , but the fourth and final chapter of Cloverfield / <unk> shows this . 
 The creature is covered with parasites , which it sheds as part of a " post @-@ birth ritual " . Abrams described the parasites as " horrifying , dog @-@ sized creatures that just scatter around the city and add to the nightmare of the evening " . Reeves added that " The parasites have a voracious , rabid , bounding nature , but they also have a crab @-@ like crawl . They have the viciousness of a dog , but with the ability to climb walls and stick to objects . " The top half of the parasite 's head is the mandible . The top and lower jaws end in serrated edges and have four pairs of eyes each . The rest of the parasite consists of a crustacean @-@ like carapace , several pairs of claws , and arms . A deep blue @-@ purple muscular membrane stretches between the top and lower jaws . When a human is bitten , the victim becomes ill and bleeds profusely , mainly from the eyes , and shortly after this , the torso expands and explodes . They are called <unk> ( Human Scale Parasites ) on the Blu @-@ ray Special Investigation Mode . 
 Artist Neville Page , in response to claims that the design of the creature was similar to that of the 2006 South Korean film The Host , said , " They are [ similar ] in that they ravage and seem to originate from the water , but the end results are quite different . However , when I finally saw some of the concept art , there were some very obvious similarities . But then again , I think that we were both channeling similar biological possibilities . "

 Based on the success of Cloverfield , which earned over $ 40 million over its opening weekend in the United States and Canadian box office , the toy company Hasbro began accepting orders for a 14 @-@ inch limited edition toy figure of the monster to be shipped to fans starting December 24 , 2008 . It also comes with several accessories , including the disembodied head of the Statue of Liberty , two changeable heads ( one with an open mouth , one with a closed mouth ) , and 10 static figures of the monster 's parasites .

 Reviewing the film Cloverfield , the San Jose Mercury News described the creature as " a monster for the MySpace generation " . Reviewer James Berardinelli noted , " The movie follows the Jaws rule that monsters are usually more intimidating when they are shown infrequently and only in brief glimpses " . Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle described the creature as retaining " an air of mystery — a monstrous je ne sais quoi that makes him all the <unk> . " Richard Corliss of Time complained of the recycled elements of the creature , such as its emergence mimicking the original Godzilla film and its parasites being similar to the " toy <unk> " from the 1984 film Gremlins . 
 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times expressed acceptance of the lack of explanation for the creature 's origin , explaining that it " is all right with me after the tiresome opening speeches in so many of the 30 or more Godzilla films " . Peter Howell of the Toronto Star thought that the " main " creature was disappointing , while he considered the " mutant spider crabs " that came from it as " way scarier " . Lawrence Person of Locus Online describes it as " like a cross between a truly giant mantis and Johnny the Skeletal Torso . " Todd McCarthy of Variety found that the creature was more reassuring as it appeared more in the film , explaining , " Its very nature as a walking , stalking being suggests it can somehow be killed by conventional means " . Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News applauded the creature 's appearance as cinematic :

At one time the subject of international controversy , he became a tourist attraction and commercial success . After the German tabloid newspaper Bild ran a quote from an animal rights activist that decried keeping the cub in captivity , fans worldwide rallied in support of his being hand @-@ raised by humans . Children protested outside the zoo , and e @-@ mails and letters expressing sympathy for the cub 's life were sent from around the world . 
 Knut became the center of a mass media phenomenon dubbed " <unk> " that spanned the globe and spawned toys , media specials , DVDs , and books . Because of this , the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue , estimated at about five million euros , at the Berlin Zoo in 2007 . Attendance figures for the year increased by an estimated 30 percent , making it the most profitable year in its 163 @-@ year history . 
 On 19 March 2011 , Knut unexpectedly died at the age of four . His death was caused by drowning after he collapsed into his enclosure 's pool while suffering from Anti @-@ NMDA receptor encephalitis . 
 = = Infancy = = 
 Knut was born at the Berlin Zoo to 20 @-@ year @-@ old Tosca , a former circus performer from East Germany who was born in Canada , and her 13 @-@ year @-@ old mate Lars , who was originally from the Tierpark Hellabrunn in Munich . After an uncomplicated gestation , Knut and his unnamed brother were born on 5 December 2006 . Tosca rejected her cubs for unknown reasons , abandoning them on a rock in the polar bear enclosure . <unk> rescued the cubs by scooping them out of the enclosure with an extended fishing net , but Knut 's brother died of an infection four days later . Knut was the first polar bear to have been born and survive in the Berlin Zoo in over 30 years . Only the size of a guinea pig , he spent the first 44 days of his life in an incubator before zookeeper Thomas Dörflein began raising the cub . 
 Knut 's need for round @-@ the @-@ clock care required that Dörflein not only sleep on a mattress next to Knut 's sleeping crate at night , but also play with , bathe , and feed the cub daily . Knut 's diet began with a bottle of baby formula mixed with cod liver oil every two hours , before graduating at the age of four months to a milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins . Dörflein also accompanied Knut on his twice @-@ daily one @-@ hour shows for the public and therefore appeared in many videos and photographs alongside the cub . As a result , Dörflein became a minor celebrity in Germany and was awarded Berlin 's Medal of Merit in honour of his continuous care for the cub . Dörflein died of a heart attack on 22 September 2008 . He was 44 years old . 
 = = Controversy and media coverage = = 
 In early March 2007 , German tabloid Bild @-@ Zeitung carried a quote by animal rights activist Frank Albrecht who said that Knut should have been killed rather than be raised by humans . He declared that the zoo was violating animal protection legislation by keeping him alive . Wolfram Graf @-@ Rudolf , the director of the Aachen Zoo , agreed with Albrecht and stated that the zookeepers " should have had the courage to let the bear die " after it was rejected , arguing that the bear will " die a little " every time it is separated from its caretaker . A group of children protested at the zoo , holding up placards reading " Knut Must Live " and " We Love Knut " , and others sent numerous emails and letters asking for the cub 's life to be spared . Threatening letters were also sent to Albrecht . The Berlin Zoo rallied in support of the baby polar bear , vowing not to harm him and rejecting the suggestion that it would be kinder to euthanise him . 
 Albrecht stated his original aim was to draw attention to the law , not to have Knut put down . In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother . His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature . In response to the criticism against him , Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs . The publicity from this coverage raised Knut 's profile from national to international . 
 = = Debut and first year = = 
 On 23 March 2007 , Knut was presented to the public for the first time . Around 400 journalists visited the Berlin Zoo on what was dubbed " Knut Day " to report on the cub 's first public appearance to a worldwide audience . Because Knut became the focus of worldwide media at a very young age , many stories and false alarms regarding the cub 's health and well @-@ being were circulated during his first year . For example , on 16 April 2007 , Knut was removed from display due to teething pains resulting from the growth of his right upper canine tooth , but initial reports vaguely stated that he was suffering from an unknown illness and subsequently put on antibiotics . Much ado was also made about a death threat that was sent shortly before 15 : 00 local time on Wednesday 18 April 2007 . The zoo had received an anonymous letter by fax which said " Knut ist tot ! Donnerstag Mittag . " ( " Knut is dead ! Thursday noon . " ) In response , the police increased their security measures around the bear . The time frame for the threat passed without incident or harm to Knut . 
 Despite Der Spiegel reporting on 30 April 2007 that Knut was " steadily getting less cute " as he increased in age , Knut continued to bring in record crowds to the zoo that summer . After reaching seven months old and 50 kg ( 110 lb ) in July 2007 , Knut 's scheduled twice daily public appearances were canceled due to the zoo 's concern for the safety of his keeper . Zoo spokeswoman Regine Damm also said it was time for the bear to " associate with other bears and not with other people . " After living in the same enclosure as Ernst , a Malaysian black bear cub who was born a month before Knut , and its mother , Knut was then moved to his own private living space . While visitor numbers dwindled from extreme highs in March and April , Knut remained a major attraction at the zoo for the rest of 2007 . 400 @,@ 000 guests were recorded in August 2007 , which was an all @-@ time high . 
 News of Knut and his life at the zoo was still being reported internationally in late 2007 . Knut 's restricted diet , necessary to curtail his natural weight gain necessary to survive harsh winters , made headlines outside of Germany . His daily meals were reduced in number from four to three , and treats , such as croissants , which were favored by the young polar bear , were restricted . After hurting his foot while slipping on a wet rock in his enclosure a month later in September , there was an outpouring of concern and support from fans worldwide . 
 In November 2007 and weighing over 90 kg ( 198 lb ) , Knut was deemed too dangerous for close handling and his interaction with human handlers was further diminished . The celebration of the cub 's first birthday , which was attended by hundreds of children , was broadcast live on German television . The national mint also issued 25 @,@ 000 special commemorative silver coins to mark his birthday . Knut 's role at the Berlin Zoo was to have included his becoming an " attractive stud " for other zoos in order to help preserve his species . When Flocke was born at the Nuremberg Zoo in December 2007 under similar circumstances , Bild dubbed her Mrs. Knut , suggesting that the two German @-@ born polar bears might become mates when they matured . 
 = = 2008 – 2010 = = 
 A year after his public debut , Knut was reported as weighing more than 130 kg ( 286 lb ) . A plate of six @-@ inch glass , strong enough to resist a mortar blast , was erected between him and zoo visitors . At the end of March 2008 , Markus Röbke , one of the keepers who helped rear Knut , reported that the bear should leave the zoo as soon as possible in order to help him acclimate to a life alone . Röbke also said that Knut plainly misses his past father @-@ figure , Thomas Dörflein , and has become so used to attention that he cries when no one is near his enclosure . " Knut needs an audience , " Röbke stated . " That has to change " . In April , animal welfare campaigners criticized the zoo for allowing Knut to kill and eat ten carp from the moat surrounding his enclosure , saying that it was a breach of German animal protection regulations . The zoo 's bear expert , Heiner <unk> , however , said that Knut 's behavior was " all part of being a polar bear . " 
 In July 2008 , it was announced that the Neumünster Zoo in northern Germany , which owns Knut 's father , was suing the Berlin Zoo for the profits from Knut 's success . Although the Berlin Zoo conceded Neumünster 's ownership of Knut due to a previous agreement , it contended that the other zoo has no right to its proceeds . Neumünster had previously tried to negotiate with Berlin Zoo , but later sought a court ruling in their favor . Peter <unk> , the zoo director at Neumünster , stated that they " do not want to remove Knut from his environment , but we have a right to our request for money . " Shortly before Knut 's second birthday , reports began circulating that the bear would have to be relocated to another zoo because he was becoming too large for his enclosure . The zoo later released statements that they wish to keep Knut , and the mayor of Berlin , Klaus Wowereit , also declared he wanted the still @-@ adolescent cub to stay in the capital . 
 Disputes between the two zoos continued into 2009 . On 19 May , the Berlin Zoo offered to buy Knut from Neumünster and therefore negate their financial claim on the two @-@ year @-@ old polar bear . Although Neumünster Zoo set a price of € 700 @,@ 000 , the Berlin Zoo stated that they would not pay " a cent more " than € 350 @,@ 000 ( $ 488 @,@ 145 ) . On 8 July , the Berlin Zoo agreed to pay € 430 @,@ 000 ( $ 599 @,@ 721 ) to keep Knut in Berlin . 
 Giovanna , a female polar bear roughly the same age as Knut , was relocated to Berlin from Munich 's Hellabrunn Animal Garden in September 2009 . She was presented to the public on 23 September , and was due to briefly share Knut 's enclosure while her regular home in Munich underwent repairs . Her arrival sparked international interest , as many sources mused that the two bears ( although sexually immature ) would soon be " dating " . However , in March 2010 , the German chapter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals called for Knut to be castrated in order to avoid inbreeding ; he and Giovanna share a grandfather and , according to PETA spokesman Frank Albrecht , the same animal rights activist who spoke out about Knut 's <unk> three years earlier , their offspring would threaten the genetic diversity of the German polar bear population . The Berlin Zoo declined to comment on the matter , only noting that Giovanna 's stay in Berlin was still temporary . In August 2010 , Giovanna was moved back to Munich after repairs on her enclosure were completed . 
 Until his death , Knut shared an enclosure with three female polar bears : Nancy , <unk> and his mother Tosca . The older bears were reportedly aggressive towards the young male bear , causing news reports in late 2010 to question whether Knut was being bullied . One of the zookeepers disagreed , stating publicly that " For the time being , Knut is not yet an adult male and doesn 't yet know how to get respect like his father did . But day by day , he is imposing himself and with time , this type of problem will go away . " 
 = = Death = = 
 On 19 March 2011 , at the age of four , Knut collapsed and died in his enclosure . Witnesses reported that after the bear 's rear left leg began shaking , he became agitated before convulsing several times and falling backwards into the pool . Approximately 600 to 700 zoo visitors witnessed Knut 's death . A statement made on 22 March in relation to the necropsy reported there were " significant changes in the brain , which may be regarded as a reason for the sudden death " . Animal welfare organizations in Germany initially accused the Berlin Zoo of negligence , claiming that Knut died of stress caused by being forced to share his enclosure with three female polar bears . The zoo denied such claims . Bear curator Heiner <unk> stated they " did everything to look after Knut — it 's normal for polar bears to live with other polar bears in a zoo , and the idea was that Knut should learn social behavior and other skills from the older females ... He played with the other bears , he was relaxed and strong . " 
 On 1 April , pathology experts announced that Knut 's immediate cause of death was from drowning . The bear 's apparent seizure was due to his suffering from Anti @-@ NMDA receptor encephalitis , a swelling of the brain likely triggered by an infection . It is unknown what infection caused the swelling , but pathologists believe it was a virus . Although Knut showed no symptoms of being ill , pathologists believe that " this suspected infection must already have been there for a long time ... at least several weeks , possibly months . " It was also announced that had Knut not drowned after collapsing , he would not have survived the encephalitis . 
 Knut 's sudden death caused an international outpouring of grief . Hundreds of fans visited the zoo after the bear 's death , leaving flowers and mementos near the enclosure . The mayor of Berlin , Klaus Wowereit , stated " We all held him so dearly . He was the star of the Berlin zoos . " 
 In January 2014 , Knut 's full autopsy results were published by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology . It was the most in @-@ depth post @-@ mortem ever carried out on an animal . The autopsy revealed that the damage to the bear ’ s brain was so severe that even if he had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway . Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis . 
 In August 2015 , it was discovered that Knut died of Anti @-@ NMDA receptor encephalitis . This was the first case discovered in non human animals .

 The zoo made plans to erect a monument in Knut 's honour , financed by donations from fans . Thomas <unk> , the chairman of the Friends of the Berlin Zoo , was quoted as saying " Knut will live on in the hearts of many visitors , but it 's important to create a memorial for coming generations to preserve the memory of this unique animal personality . " On 24 October 2012 , the Berlin Zoo unveiled a bronze sculpture by Ukrainian artist Josef <unk> . " Knut – The Dreamer " shows the bear " stretching out dreamily on a rock " . 
 Knut 's remains were exhibited in Berlin 's Museum of Natural History , although this decision has caused some controversy with fans . A full @-@ sized sculpture covered in Knut 's pelt was presented to the public on 16 February 2013 . It went on display in the entrance hall of the museum where it was viewed free of charge until 5 May . It will later be used for an exhibition on climate change and environment protection . Museum spokeswoman <unk> Steiner stated that " It 's important to make clear we haven 't had Knut stuffed . It is an artistically valuable sculpture with the original fur . " 
 From 13 June till 1 September 2013 , Knut went on display in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center , the Dutch national museum of natural history in Leiden , Netherlands . 
 Knut returned to Berlin 's Museum of Natural History on 28 July 2014 as an exhibit for a special exhibition on “ Highlights of <unk> ” . The museum has won world championship prizes for taxidermy and Knut ’ s remains will be the highlight of this exhibition for years to come .

 The Berlin Zoo registered " Knut " as a trademark in late March 2007 . As a result , its shares more than doubled at the Berlin Stock Exchange ; previously worth around € 2 @,@ 000 , the value closed at € 4 @,@ 820 just a week later . The zoo reported that its attendance figures for 2007 increased by an estimated 30 percent , making it the most profitable it had been in its 163 @-@ year history . Knut earned the Berlin Zoo nearly € 5 million that year , mainly thanks to an increase in visitors as well as the amount of merchandise sold . 
 Various companies profited from the attention surrounding Knut by developing themed products such as ringtones and cuddly toys . Plush toy company Steiff produced several Knut @-@ based plush toys in three sizes and models : sitting , standing , and lying down . The first 2 @,@ 400 produced toys , which sold exclusively at the Berlin Zoo , sold out in only four days . The money raised from the Steiff deal was intended to be used to renovate the polar bear enclosure at the zoo . Candy company <unk> released a raspberry @-@ flavored gummy bear sweet called Cuddly Knut beginning in April 2007 . They pledged to donate ten cents to the zoo for every tub of Knut sweets it sold . The gummy bears sold so well that the Bonn @-@ based company had to expand production to a second factory to deal with demand . 
 Knut was the subject of several popular songs in Germany , the most successful of which were the singles " Knut is Cute " and " Knut , der kleine Eisbär " ( English : " Knut , the little polar bear " ) by nine @-@ year @-@ old Kitty from <unk> . In Britain , musical comedian Mitch Benn has performed four songs about Knut for BBC Radio 4 satirical series The Now Show : " The Baby Bear Must DIE ! " , " Knut Isn 't Cute Anymore " , " Goodbye Knut " and " Panda in Berlin " . A blog with updates about the polar bear was maintained by a journalist at the regional public broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin @-@ Brandenburg ; it was available in German , English , and Spanish . <unk> was also responsible for a weekly television program dedicated to the polar bear cub that was broadcast in Germany . Knut has also been the subject of several DVDs , including one entitled " Knut – Stories from a Polar Bear 's Nursery " . On 29 March 2007 he appeared on the cover of the German Vanity Fair magazine , which included a several page spread about the cub 's life . 
 On 1 May 2007 , it was announced that New York @-@ based Turtle Pond Publications and the Berlin Zoo had signed a deal for the worldwide publishing rights to Knut with the hopes of raising awareness of global warming issues . Written by Craig <unk> and his daughters Juliana and Isabella , the 44 @-@ page book entitled Knut , der kleine <unk> ( Little Polar Bear Knut ) includes Knut 's life story as well as previously unpublished photographs . Although several books about Knut had already been published in Germany , this book was the first to be authorized by the Berlin Zoo . 
 The book was published in Germany by <unk> on 26 July 2007 and US publishing company Scholastic released the English version , entitled Knut : How one little polar bear captivated the world , in the United States in November of the same year . Rights to the book have also been sold to publishers in Japan , England , Mexico , China , and Italy . 
 On 31 December 2007 , the zoo 's director confirmed the zoo had received a proposal for a film deal from Hollywood film producer Ash R. Shah , whose films include Supernova and Shark Bait , to make an animated film about the bear 's life . Shah reportedly approached the Berlin Zoo with a purported € 3 @.@ 5 million film deal . Knut made his big screen debut in the German film Knut und seine Freunde ( Knut and His Friends ) , which premiered in Berlin on 2 March 2008 . Directed by Michael Johnson , the film depicts how Knut was rescued after his mother abandoned him and also features a polar bear family from the Arctic and two brown bear cubs from Belarus .

 Dr. Gerald Uhlich , of the Berlin zoo 's board of trustees , stated that because of his vast popularity , Knut had become a means of communication and that he had the ability to " draw attention to the environment in a nice way . Not in a threatening , scolding way . " As a result , the German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel officially adopted Knut as the mascot for a conference on endangered species to be held in Bonn in 2008 . The minister met with Knut soon after his zoo debut , commenting that although Knut was in safe hands , " worldwide polar bears are in danger and if Knut can help the cause , then that is a good thing . " 
 Photographer Annie Leibovitz took pictures of Knut that were used for an environmental campaign , including Vanity Fair magazine 's May 2007 Green Issue in which he was superimposed into a photograph with American actor Leonardo DiCaprio . The polar bear has also been depicted on the logo for the German Environment Minister 's campaign to help stop global warming and a 2008 special issue stamp . Officially released on 9 April , the stamp shows the roughly one @-@ year @-@ old Knut with the slogan " Natur <unk> <unk> " ( " Preserve nature worldwide " ) . 
 = Michael John O 'Leary = 
 Major Michael John O 'Leary VC ( 29 September 1890 – 2 August 1961 ) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross , the most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces . O 'Leary achieved his award for single @-@ handedly charging and destroying two German barricades defended by machine gun positions near the French village of <unk> , in a localised operation on the Western Front during the First World War . 
 At the time of his action , O 'Leary was a nine @-@ year veteran of the British armed forces and by the time he retired from the British Army in 1921 , he had reached the rank of lieutenant . He served in the army again during the Second World War , although his later service was blighted by periods of ill @-@ health . At his final retirement from the military in 1945 , O 'Leary was an Army major in command of a prisoner of war camp . Between the wars , O 'Leary spent many years employed as a police officer in Canada and is sometimes considered to be a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross . Following the Second World War he worked as a building contractor in London , where he died in 1961 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 O 'Leary was born in 1890 , one of four children of Daniel and Margaret O 'Leary , who owned a farm at <unk> , near Macroom in County Cork , Ireland . Daniel O 'Leary was a fervent Irish nationalist and keen sportsman who participated in competitive weightlifting and football . Aged 16 and unwilling to continue to work on his parent 's land , Michael O 'Leary joined the Royal Navy , serving at the shore establishment HMS Vivid at Devonport for several years until rheumatism in his knees forced his departure from the service . Within a few months however , O 'Leary had again tired of the farm and joined the Irish Guards regiment of the British Army . 
 O 'Leary served three years with the Irish Guards , leaving in August 1913 to join the Royal Northwest Mounted Police ( RNWMP ) in Saskatchewan , Canada . Operating from Regina , Constable O 'Leary was soon commended for his bravery in capturing two criminals following a two @-@ hour <unk> , for which service he was presented with a gold ring . At the outbreak of the First World War in Europe during August 1914 , O 'Leary was given permission to leave the RNWMP and return to Britain in order to rejoin the army as an active reservist . On 22 October , O 'Leary was mobilized and on 23 November he joined his regiment in France , then fighting with the British Expeditionary Force , entrenched in Flanders . 
 = = First World War service = = 
 During December 1914 , O 'Leary saw heavy fighting with the Irish Guards and was Mentioned in Despatches and subsequently promoted to Lance Corporal on 5 January 1915 . Three weeks later , on 30 January , the Irish Guards were ordered to prepare for an attack on German positions near <unk> on the La Bassée Canal , a response to a successful German operation in the area five days before . The Germans attacked first however , and on the morning of 1 February seized a stretch of canal embankment on the western end of the 2nd Brigade line from a company of Coldstream Guards . This section , known as the Hollow , was tactically important as it defended a culvert that passed underneath a railway embankment . 4 Company of Irish Guards , originally in reserve , were tasked with joining the Coldstream Guards in retaking the position at 04 : 00 , but the attack was met with heavy machine gun fire and most of the assault party , including all of the Irish Guards officers , were killed or wounded . 
 To replace these officers , Second Lieutenant Innes of 1 Company was ordered forward to gather the survivors and withdraw , forming up at a barricade on the edge of the Hollow . Innes regrouped the survivors and , following a heavy bombardment from supporting artillery and with his own company providing covering fire , assisted the Coldstream Guards in a second attack at 10 : 15 . <unk> down with entrenching equipment , the attacking Coldstream Guardsmen faltered and began to suffer heavy casualties . Innes too came under heavy fire from a German barricade to their front equipped with a machine gun . 
 Michael O 'Leary had been serving as Innes 's orderly , and had joined him in the operations earlier in the morning and again in the second attack . Charging past the rest of the assault party , O 'Leary closed with the first German barricade at the top of the railway embankment and fired five shots , killing the gun 's crew . Continuing forward , O 'Leary confronted a second barricade , also armed with a machine gun 60 yards ( 55 m ) further on and again mounted the railway embankment , to avoid the marshy ground on either side . The Germans spotted his approach , but could not bring their gun to bear on him before he opened fire , killing three soldiers and capturing two others after he ran out of ammunition . Reportedly , O 'Leary had made his advance on the second barricade " intent upon killing another German to whom he had taken a dislike " . 
 Having disabled both guns and enabled the recapture of the British position , O 'Leary then returned to his unit with his prisoners , apparently " as cool as if he had been for a walk in the park . " For his actions , O 'Leary received a battlefield promotion to sergeant on 4 February and was recommended for the Victoria Cross , which was gazetted on 18 February :

 Returning to Britain to receive his medal from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 22 June 1915 , O 'Leary was given a grand reception attended by thousands of Londoners in Hyde Park on 10 July . He was also the subject of much patriotic writing , including a poem in the Daily Mail and the short play O 'Flaherty V.C. by George Bernard Shaw . Tributes came from numerous prominent figures of the day , including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who said that " No writer in fiction would dare to fasten such an achievement on any of his characters , but the Irish have always had a reputation of being wonderful fighters , and Lance @-@ Corporal Michael O ’ Leary is clearly one of them . " and Thomas Scanlan who said : " I heard early this week of the great achievements of the Irish Guards . All Ireland is proud of O ’ Leary . He fully deserves the high honour that has been conferred upon him . Ireland is grateful to him . " His reception was repeated in Macroom when he visited Ireland , with crowds turning out to applaud him . Daniel O 'Leary was interviewed in a local newspaper regarding his son 's exploit but was reportedly unimpressed , commenting : " I am surprised he didn 't do more . I often laid out twenty men myself with a stick coming from Macroom Fair , and it is a bad trial of Mick that he could kill only eight , and he having a rifle and bayonet . " 
 O 'Leary was further rewarded for his service , being advanced to a commissioned rank as a second lieutenant with the Connaught Rangers , and he was also presented with a Russian decoration , the Cross of St. George ( third class ) . Despite his popularity with the crowds in London and Macroom , he was jeered by Ulster Volunteers at a recruitment drive in <unk> during the autumn of 1915 . This treatment caused such a scandal that it was raised in the Houses of Parliament in December . 
 In 1916 , O 'Leary travelled to Salonika with the 5th battalion of the Connaught Rangers to serve in the Balkans campaign , remaining in theatre until the end of the war , following which he was stationed in Dover with the 2nd battalion until demobilised in 1921 . During his service in the Balkans , O 'Leary contracted malaria , which was to have severe negative effects on his health for the rest of his life . 
 He was in the same regiment as the British actor Stanley Holloway and both served together in France . After the war ended , they both remained close friends and Holloway often stayed in The May Fair where O 'Leary later worked as a concierge .

 Leaving his wife Greta and their two children in Britain , O 'Leary returned to Canada in March 1921 with the purported intention of rejoining the RNWMP , newly renamed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police . For unknown reasons , this plan came to nothing and after some months giving lectures on his war service and working in a publishing house , O 'Leary joined the Ontario Provincial Police , charged with enforcing the prohibition laws . In 1924 , with his family recently arrived from England , O 'Leary left the Ontario police force and became a police sergeant with the Michigan Central Railway in <unk> , Ontario , receiving £ 33 a month . 
 In 1925 , O 'Leary was the subject of several scandals , being arrested for smuggling illegal immigrants and later for irregularities in his investigations . Although he was acquitted both times , he spent a week in prison following the second arrest and lost his job with the railway . Several months later , the municipal authorities in Hamilton , Ontario loaned him £ 70 to pay for him and his family to return to Ireland . Although his family sailed on the SS Leticia , O 'Leary remained in Ontario , working with the attorney general 's office . 
 With his health in serious decline , the British Legion arranged for O 'Leary to return to Britain and work in their poppy factory . By 1932 , O 'Leary was living in <unk> Avenue in Colindale , had regained his health and found employment as a <unk> at The May Fair in London , at which he was involved in charitable events for wounded servicemen . With the mobilisation of the British Army in 1939 , O 'Leary returned to military service as a captain in the Middlesex Regiment . O 'Leary was sent to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force but had returned to Britain before the Battle of France due to a recurrence of his malaria . 
 No longer fit for full active service , O 'Leary was transferred to the Pioneer Corps and took command of a prisoner of war camp in Southern England . In 1945 , he was discharged from the military as unfit for duty on medical grounds as a major and found work as a building contractor , in which career he remained until his retirement in 1954 . Two of O 'Leary 's sons had also served in the military during the war , with both receiving Distinguished Flying Crosses for their actions . As a Victoria Cross recipient , O 'Leary joined the VE day parade in 1946 , but at the 1956 Centenary VC review his place was taken by an imposter travelling in a bath chair . With his health again declining , O 'Leary moved to <unk> Gardens in Edgware shortly before his death in 1961 at the Whittington Hospital in Islington . 
 O 'Leary was buried at Mill Hill Cemetery following a funeral service at the Roman Catholic Annunciation Church in Burnt Oak which was attended by an honour guard from the Irish Guards and six of his children . His medals were later presented to the Irish Guards , and are on display at the Regimental Headquarters . He is also remembered in his birthplace , the <unk> @-@ online website listing him as a prominent citizen and states that " while many might consider he was fighting with the wrong army , in the wrong war , he was nevertheless a very brave , resourceful and capable <unk> [ sic ] who deserved the honours bestowed upon him .

 = Mari , Syria = 
 Mari ( modern Tell Hariri ) , was an ancient Semitic city in Syria . Its remains constitute a tell located 11 kilometers north @-@ west of Abu Kamal on the Euphrates river western bank , some 120 kilometers southeast of Deir ez @-@ Zor . It flourished as a trade center and hegemonic state between 2900 BC and 1759 BC . As a purposely built city , the existence of Mari was related to its position in the middle of the Euphrates trade routes ; this position made it an intermediary between Sumer in the south and the Levant in the west . 
 Mari was first abandoned in the middle of the 26th century BC but was rebuilt and became the capital of a hegemonic East @-@ Semitic state before 2500 BC . This second Mari engaged in a long war with its rival Ebla , and is known for its strong affinity with the Sumerian culture . It was destroyed in the 23rd century BC by the Akkadians who allowed the city to be rebuilt and appointed a military governor bearing the title of Shakkanakku ( military governor ) . The governors later became independent with the rapid disintegration of the Akkadian empire and rebuilt the city as a regional center in the middle Euphrates valley . The Shakkanakkus ruled Mari until the second half of the 19th century BC when the dynasty collapsed for unknown reasons . A short time after the Shakkanakku collapse , Mari became the capital of the Amorite Lim dynasty . The Amorite Mari was short lived as it was annexed by Babylonia in c . 1761 BC , but the city survived as a small settlement under the rule of the Babylonians and the Assyrians before being abandoned and forgotten during the Hellenistic period . 
 The <unk> worshiped both Semitic and Sumerian deities and established their city as a center of old trade . However , although the pre @-@ Amorite periods were characterized by heavy Sumerian cultural influence , Mari was not a city of Sumerian immigrants but rather a Semitic speaking nation that used a dialect similar to Eblaite . The Amorites were West @-@ Semites who began to settle the area before the 21st century BC ; by the Lim dynasty 's era ( c . 1830 BC ) , they became the dominant population in the Fertile Crescent . 
 Mari 's discovery in 1933 provided an important insight into the geopolitical map of ancient Mesopotamia and Syria , due to the discovery of more than 25 @,@ 000 tablets that contained important information about the administration of state during the second millennium BC and the nature of diplomatic relations between the political entities in the region . They also revealed the wide trading networks of the 18th century BC , which connected areas as far as Afghanistan in Southern Asia and Crete in the Mediterranean region . 
 = = History = = 
 The name of the city can be traced to Mer , an ancient storm deity of northern Mesopotamia and Syria who was considered the patron deity of the city , Georges Dossin noted that the name of the city was spelled identically like the name of the storm god and concluded that Mari was named after him . 
 = = = The first kingdom = = = 
 Mari is not considered a small settlement that later grew , but rather a new city that was purposely founded during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I c . 2900 BC , to control the waterways of the Euphrates trade routes that connect the Levant with the Sumerian south . The city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers away from the Euphrates river to protect it from floods , and was connected to the river by an artificial canal that was between 7 and 10 kilometers long depending on which old meander it used to be attached with , which is hard to identify today . 
 The city is difficult to excavate , as it is buried deep under the later layers of habitation . A defensive system against floods , composed of a circular embankment was unearthed , in addition to a circular 6 @.@ 7 m thick internal rampart to protect the city from enemies . An area of 300 meters long filled with gardens and craftsmen quarters , separated the outer embankment from the inner rampart which had a height of 8 to 10 meters , and was strengthened by defensive towers . Other findings includes one of the city gates , a street beginning at the center and ending at the gate , in addition to residential houses . Mari had a central mound , however no temple or palaces have been unearthed , although a large building that seem to have been an administrative one was unearthed , this building had stone foundations and dimensions of ( 32 meters X 25 meters ) , with rooms up to 12 meters long and 6 meters wide . The city was abandoned at the end of the Early Dynastic period II c . <unk> BC for unknown reasons . 
 = = = The second kingdom = = = 
 Around the beginning of the Early Dynastic period III ( earlier than 2500 BC ) , Mari was rebuilt and populated again . The new city kept many of the first city exterior features , including the internal rampart and gate . Also kept , the outer circular embankment measuring 1 @.@ 9 km in diameter , which was topped by a wall that is two meters thick , suitable for the protection of archers . 
 However , the internal structure was completely changed , the city was carefully planned ; first to be built were the streets that descends from the elevated center into the gates , assuring the drainage of rain water . 
 At the heart of the city , a royal palace was built which also served as a temple . Four successive architectural levels from the second kingdom 's palace have been unearthed ( the oldest is designated P3 , while the latest is <unk> ) , and the last two levels are dated to the Akkadian period . The first two levels were excavated , the findings includes a temple named Enceinte Sacrée , which was the largest in the city but it is unknown for whom it was dedicated . Also unearthed , a pillared throne room and a hall that have three double wood pillars leading to the temple . 
 Six more temples were discovered in the city , including the temple called the Massif Rouge ( to whom it was dedicated is unknown ) , and temples dedicated for Ninni @-@ Zaza , <unk> , Ishtar , Ninhursag and Shamash . All the temples were located in the center of the city except for the Ishtar temple , the area between the Enceinte Sacrée and the Massif Rouge is considered the administrative center of the high priest . 
 The second kingdom appears to be a powerful and prosperous political center , kings held the title of <unk> , and many are attested in the city , but the most important source is the letter of king Enna @-@ Dagan c . 2350 BC , which was sent to Irkab @-@ Damu of Ebla , and in it , the Mariote king mentions his predecessors and their military achievements . However , the reading of this letter is still problematic and many interpretations have been presented by scholars . 
 = = = = Mari @-@ Ebla war = = = = 
 The earliest attested king in the letter of Enna @-@ Dagan is <unk> , who is mentioned as attacking Ebla , the traditional rival of Mari with whom it had a long war , and conquering many of Ebla 's cities , including the land of <unk> . The next king mentioned in the letter is <unk> , who conquered the lands of Ra 'ak and <unk> , but king Kun @-@ Damu of Ebla defeated Mari in the middle of the 25th century BC . The war continued with <unk> @-@ <unk> of Mari conquest of Emar , at a time of Eblaite weakness in the mid @-@ 24th century BC . King Igrish @-@ Halam of Ebla had to pay tribute to Iblul @-@ Il of Mari , who is mentioned in the letter conquering many of Ebla 's cities and campaigning in the Burman region . 
 Enna @-@ Dagan also received tribute , and his reign fell entirely within the reign of Irkab @-@ Damu of Ebla , who managed to defeat Mari and end the tribute . Mari defeated Ebla 's ally Nagar in year seven of the Eblaite vizier Ibrium 's term , causing the blockage of trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia . The war reached a climax when the Eblaite vizier Ibbi @-@ Sipish made an alliance with Nagar and Kish to defeat Mari in a battle near Terqa . Ebla itself suffered its first destruction a few years after Terqa in c . 2300 BC , during the reign of the Mariote king <unk> . 
 According to Alfonso Archi , <unk> was succeeded by <unk> @-@ Mari whose royal seal was discovered and it depicts battle scenes , causing Archi to suggest that he was responsible for the destruction of Ebla while still a general . Just a decade after Ebla 's destruction ( c . 2300 BC middle chronology ) , Mari itself was destroyed and burned by Sargon of Akkad , Michael Astour give the date as c . <unk> BC ( short chronology ) . 
 = = = The third kingdom = = = 
 Mari was deserted for two generations before being restored by the Akkadian king <unk> . A governor was appointed to govern the city who held the title " Shakkanakku " ( military governor ) . Akkad kept direct control over the city , which is evident by Naram @-@ Sin of Akkad 's appointment of two of his daughters to priestly offices in the city . 
 = = = = The Shakkanakku dynasty = = = = 
 The first member of the Shakkanakku dynasty on the lists is <unk> who was appointed in c . <unk> BC , according to the lists , <unk> ruled for 60 years , and was succeeded by his son making the position hereditary . 
 The third Mari followed the second city in terms of general structure , phase <unk> of the old royal palace was replaced by a new palace for the Shakkanakku . Another smaller palace was built in the eastern part of the city , and contained royal burials that date to the former periods . The ramparts were rebuilt and strengthened while the embankment was turned into a defensive wall that reached 10 meters in width . The former sacred <unk> was maintained , so was the temple of Ninhursag . However , the temples of Ninni @-@ Zaza and <unk> disappeared , while a new temple called the " temple of lions " ( dedicated to Dagan ) , was built by the Shakkanakku <unk> @-@ <unk> and attached to it , was a rectangular terrace ( ziggurat ) that measured 40 x 20 meters for sacrifices . 
 Akkad disintegrated following Shar @-@ Kali @-@ Sharri 's reign , and Mari gained its independence , but the use of the Shakkanakku title continued during the following Third Dynasty of Ur period . A princess of Mari married the son of king Ur @-@ Nammu of Ur , and Mari was nominally under Ur hegemony . However , the vassalage did not impede the independence of Mari , and some Shakkanakkus used the royal title <unk> in their votive inscriptions , while using the title of Shakkanakku in their correspondence with the Ur 's court . The dynasty ended for unknown reasons not long before the establishment of the next dynasty , which took place in the second half of the 19th century BC . 
 = = = = The Lim dynasty = = = = 
 The second millennium BC in the Fertile Crescent was characterized by the expansion of the Amorites , which culminated with them dominating and ruling most of the region , including Mari which in c . 1830 BC , became the seat of the Amorite Lim dynasty under king Yaggid @-@ Lim . However , the <unk> and archaeological evidences showed a high degree of continuity between the Shakkanakku and the Amorite eras . 
 Yaggid @-@ Lim was the ruler of <unk> before establishing himself in Mari , he entered an alliance with Ila @-@ kabkabu of <unk> , but the relations between the two monarchs changed to an open war . The conflict ended with Ila @-@ kabkabu capturing Yaggid @-@ Lim 's heir Yahdun @-@ Lim and according to a tablet found in Mari , Yaggid @-@ Lim who survived Ila @-@ kabkabu was killed by his servants . However , in c . 1820 BC Yahdun @-@ Lim was firmly in control as king of Mari . 
 Yahdun @-@ Lim started his reign by subduing seven of his rebelling tribal leaders , and rebuilding the walls of Mari and Terqa in addition to building a new fort which he named Dur @-@ Yahdun @-@ Lim . He then expanded west and claimed to have reached the Mediterranean , however he later had to face a rebellion by the Banu @-@ Yamina nomads who were centered at Tuttul , and the rebels were supported by Yamhad 's king Sumu @-@ Epuh , whose interests were threatened by the recently established alliance between Yahdun @-@ Lim and Eshnunna . Yahdun @-@ Lim defeated the Yamina but an open war with Yamhad was avoided , as the Mariote king became occupied by his rivalry with Shamshi @-@ Adad I of Assyria , the son of the late Ila @-@ kabkabu . The war ended in a defeat for Mari , and Yahdun @-@ Lim was assassinated in c . 1798 BC by his possible son Sumu @-@ <unk> , who himself got assassinated two years after ascending the throne while Shamshi @-@ Adad advanced and annexed Mari . 
 = = = = = The Assyrian era and the Lim restoration = = = = = 
 Shamshi @-@ Adad appointed his son Yasmah @-@ Adad on the throne of Mari , the new king married Yahdun @-@ Lim 's daughter , while the rest of the Lim family took refuge in Yamhad , and the annexation was officially justified by what Shamshi @-@ Adad considered sinful acts on the side of the Lim family . To strengthen his position against his new enemy Yamhad , Shamshi @-@ Adad married Yasmah @-@ Adad to <unk> , the daughter of Ishi @-@ Adad of Qatna . However , Yasmah @-@ Adad neglected his bride causing a crisis with Qatna , and he proved to be an unable leader causing the rage of his father who died in c . 1776 BC , while the armies of Yarim @-@ Lim I of Yamhad were advancing in support of Zimri @-@ Lim , the heir of the Lim dynasty . 
 As Zimri @-@ Lim advanced , a leader of the Banu @-@ Simaal ( Zimri @-@ Lim 's tribe ) overthrew Yasmah @-@ Adad , opening the road for Zimri @-@ Lim who arrived a few months after Yasmah @-@ Adad 's escape , and married princess Shibtu the daughter of Yarim @-@ Lim I a short time after his enthronement in c . 1776 BC . Zimri @-@ Lim 's ascension to the throne with the help of Yarim @-@ Lim I affected Mari 's status , Zimri @-@ Lim referred to Yarim @-@ Lim as his father , and the Yamhadite king was able to order Mari as the mediator between Yamhad 's main deity Hadad and Zimri @-@ Lim , who declared himself a servant of Hadad . 
 Zimri @-@ Lim started his reign with a campaign against the Banu @-@ Yamina , he also established alliances with Eshnunna and Hammurabi of Babylon , and sent his armies to aid the Babylonians . The new king directed his expansion policy toward the north in the Upper Khabur region , which was named <unk> , where he subjugated the local petty kingdoms in the region such as Urkesh , and <unk> , forcing them into vassalage . The expansion was met by the resistance of <unk> @-@ Lim , the king of <unk> , whom Zimri @-@ Lim defeated , securing the Mariote control over the region in c . 1771 BC , and the kingdom prospered as a trading center and entered a period of relative peace . Zimri @-@ Lim 's greatest heritage was the renovation of the Royal Palace , which was expanded greatly to contain 275 rooms , exquisite artifacts such as The Goddess of the Vase statue , and a royal archive that contained 25000 tablets . 
 Mari 's alliance with Eshnunna contributed to its demise , as that city later became an enemy of Hammurabi . The relations with Babylon worsened with a dispute over the city of Hīt that consumed much time in negotiations , during which a war against Elam involved both kingdoms in c . 1765 BC . Finally , the kingdom was invaded by Hammurabi who defeated Zimri @-@ Lim in battle in c . 1761 BC and ended the Lim dynasty , while Terqa became the capital of a rump state named the Kingdom of Hana . 
 = = = Later periods = = = 
 Mari survived the destruction and rebelled against Babylon in c . 1759 BC , causing Hammurabi to destroy the whole city . However , Mari was allowed to survive as a small village under Babylonian administration , an act that Hammurabi considered merciful . Later , Mari became part of Assyria and was listed among the territories conquered by the Assyrian king Tukulti @-@ Ninurta I ( reigned 1243 – 1207 BC ) . Afterward , Mari constantly changed hands between Assyria and Babylon . 
 In the middle of the eleventh century BC , Mari became part of Hana whose king Tukulti @-@ Mer took the title king of Mari and rebelled against Assyria , causing the Assyrian king Ashur @-@ bel @-@ kala to attack the city . Mari came firmly under the authority of the Neo @-@ Assyrian Empire , and was assigned in the first half of the 8th century BC to a certain Nergal @-@ <unk> to govern under the authority of king Adad @-@ <unk> III ( reigned 810 @-@ 783 BC ) . In c . 760 BC , Shamash @-@ Risha @-@ Usur , an autonomous governor ruling parts of the upper middle Euphrates under the nominal authority of Ashur @-@ dan III , styled himself the governor of the lands of <unk> and Mari , so did his son Ninurta @-@ <unk> @-@ Usur . However , by that time , Mari was known to be located in the so @-@ called Land of <unk> , making it unlikely that the Usur family actually controlled it , and suggesting that the title was employed out of historical reasons . The city continued as a small settlement until the Hellenistic period before disappearing from records . 
 = = People , language and government = = 
 The founders of the first city may have been Sumerians or more probably East Semitic speaking people from Terqa in the north . I. J. Gelb relates Mari 's foundation with the Kish civilization , which was a cultural entity of East Semitic speaking populations , that stretched from the center of Mesopotamia to Ebla in the western Levant . 
 At its height , the second city was the home of about 40 @,@ 000 people . This population was East @-@ Semitic speaking one , and used a dialect much similar to the language of Ebla ( the Eblaite language ) , while the Shakkanakku period had an East @-@ Semitic Akkadian speaking population . West Semitic names started to be attested in Mari since the second kingdom era , and by the middle Bronze @-@ Age , the west Semitic Amorite tribes became the majority of the pastoral groups in the middle Euphrates and Khabur valleys . Amorite names started to be observed in the city toward the end of the Shakkanakku period , even among the ruling dynasty members . 
 During the Lim era , the population became predominantly Amorite but also included Akkadian named people , and although the Amorite language became the dominant tongue , Akkadian remained the language of writing . The pastoral Amorites in Mari were called the Haneans , a term that indicate nomads in general , those Haneans were split into the Banu @-@ Yamina ( sons of the right ) and Banu @-@ Simaal ( sons of the left ) , with the ruling house belonging to the Banu @-@ Simaal branch . The kingdom was also a home to tribes of <unk> who lived in the district of Terqa . 
 Mari was an absolute monarchy , with the king controlling every aspect of the administration , helped by the scribes who played the role of administrators . During the Lim era , Mari was divided into four provinces in addition to the capital , the provincial seats were located at Terqa , <unk> , <unk> and Tuttul . Each province had its own bureaucracy , the government supplied the villagers with ploughs and agricultural equipments , in return for a share in the harvest . 
 = = = Kings of Mari = = = 
 The Sumerian King List ( SKL ) records a dynasty of six kings from Mari enjoying hegemony between the dynasty of Adab and the dynasty of Kish . The names of the Mariote kings were damaged on the early copies of the list , and those kings were correlated with historical kings that belonged to the second city . However , an undamaged copy of the list that date to the old Babylonian period was discovered in <unk> @-@ Enlil , and the names bears no resemblance to any of the historically attested monarchs of the second city , indicating that the compilers of the list had an older and probably a legendary dynasty in mind , that predate the second city . 
 The chronological order of the kings from the second kingdom era is highly uncertain ; nevertheless , it is assumed that the letter of Enna @-@ Dagan lists them in a chronological order . Many of the kings were attested through their own votive objects discovered in the city , and the dates are highly speculative . 
 For the Shakkanakkus , the lists are incomplete and after Hanun @-@ Dagan who ruled at the end of the Ur era c . 2008 BC ( c . 1920 BC Short chronology ) , they become full of lacunae . Roughly 13 more Shakkanakkus succeeded Hanun @-@ Dagan but only few are known , with the last known one reigning not too long before the reign of Yaggid @-@ Lim who founded the Lim dynasty in c . 1830 BC . 
 = = Culture and religion = = 
 The first and second kingdoms were heavily influenced by the Sumerian south . The society was led by an urban oligarchy , and the citizens were well known for elaborate hair styles and dress . The calendar was based on a solar year divided into twelve months , and was the same calendar used in Ebla " the old Eblaite calendar " . Scribes wrote in Sumerian language and the art was indistinguishable from Sumerian art , so was the architectural style . 
 Mesopotamian influence continued to affect Mari 's culture during the Amorite period , which is evident in the Babylonian scribal style used in the city . However , it was less influential than the former periods and a distinct Syrian style prevailed , which is noticeable in the seals of kings , which reflect a clear Syrian origin . The society was a tribal one , it consisted mostly of farmers and nomads ( Haneans ) , and in contrast to Mesopotamia , the temple had a minor role in everyday life as the power was mostly invested in the palace . Women enjoyed a relative equality to men , queen Shibtu ruled in her husband 's name while he was away , and had an extensive administrative role and authority over her husband 's highest officials . 
 The Pantheon included both Sumerian and Semitic deities , and throughout most of its history , Dagan was Mari 's head of the Pantheon , while Mer was the patron deity . Other deities included the Semitic deities ; Ishtar the goddess of fertility , <unk> , and Shamash , the Sun god who was regarded among the city most important deities , and believed to be all @-@ knowing and all @-@ seeing . Sumerian deities included Ninhursag , Dumuzi , <unk> , Anu , and Enlil . Prophecy had an important role for the society , temples included prophets , who gave council to the king and participated in the religious festivals . <unk> , the singer of Ishtar temple , was one of the oldest multi @-@ talented women who has a prominent statue depicting her playing music during the reign of Iblul @-@ Il . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The first Mari provided the oldest wheels workshop to be discovered in Syria , and was a center of bronze metallurgy . The city also contained districts devoted to smelting , dyeing and pottery manufacturing , charcoal was brought by river boats from the upper Khabur and Euphrates area . 
 The second kingdom 's economy was based on both agriculture and trade . The economy was centralized and directed through a communal organization , where grains were stored in communal granaries , and distributed amongst the population according to social statues . The organization also controlled the animal herds in the kingdom . Some people were directly connected to the palace instead of the communal organization , those included the metal and textile producers and the military officials . Ebla was Mari 's most important trading partner and rival , Mari 's position made it an important trading center as it controlled the road linking between the Levant and Mesopotamia . 
 The Amorite Mari maintained the older aspects of the economy , which was still largely based on irrigated agriculture along the Euphrates valley . The city kept its trading role and was a center for merchants from Babylonia and other kingdoms , it received goods from the south and east through riverboats and distributed them north , north west and west . The main <unk> handled by Mari were metals and tin imported from the Iranian Plateau and then exported west as far as Crete . Other goods included copper from Cyprus , silver from Anatolia , woods from Lebanon , gold from Egypt , olive oil , wine , and textiles in addition to precious stones from modern Afghanistan .

 Mari was discovered in 1933 , on the eastern flank of Syria , near the Iraqi border . A Bedouin tribe was digging through a mound called Tell Hariri for a gravestone that would be used for a recently deceased tribesman , when they came across a headless statue . After the news reached the French authorities currently in control of Syria , the report was investigated , and digging on the site was started on December 14 , 1933 by archaeologists from the Louvre in Paris . Discoveries came quickly , with the temple of Ishtar being discovered in the next month . Mari was classified by the archaeologists as the " most westerly outpost of Sumerian culture " . 
 Since the beginning of excavations , over 25 @,@ 000 clay tablets in Akkadian language written in cuneiform were discovered . Finds from the excavation are on display in the Louvre , the National Museum of Aleppo , the National Museum of Damascus , and the Deir ez @-@ Zor Museum . In the latter , the southern façade of the Court of the Palms room from Zimri @-@ Lim 's palace has been reconstructed , including the wall paintings . 
 Mari has been excavated in annual campaigns between 1933 @-@ 1939 , 1951 @-@ 1956 , and since 1960 , and the first 21 seasons up to 1975 were led by André Parrot , followed by Jean @-@ Claude <unk> ( until 2004 ) , and Pascal <unk> ( starting in 2005 ) . A journal devoted to the site since 1982 , is Mari : Annales de <unk> <unk> . Archaeologists have tried to determine how many layers the site descends , according to French archaeologist André Parrot , " each time a vertical probe was commenced in order to trace the site 's history down to virgin soil , such important discoveries were made that horizontal digging had to be resumed .

 The tablets were written in Akkadian , and they give informations about the kingdom , its customs , and the names of people who lived during that time . More than 3000 are letters , the remainder includes administrative , economic , and judicial texts . The tablets , according to André Parrot , " brought about a complete revision of the historical dating of the ancient Near East and provided more than 500 new place names , enough to redraw or even draw up the geographical map of the ancient world . " Almost all the tablets found were dated to the last 50 years of Mari 's independence ( c . 1800 – 1750 BC ) , and most have now been published . The language of the texts is official Akkadian but proper names and hints in syntax show that the common language of Mari 's inhabitants was Northwest Semitic .

 Usher and will.i.am shot the video the weekend of March 6 , 2010 . The video was directed by Anthony Mandler . In an interview with Rap @-@ Up , Mandler said about the concept of the video : " ... The video is a spectacle . It really emphasizes what we love about Usher and the character and the icon that he is , and most importantly , it ’ s really a video that showcases his superstardom " . The video was released on March 30 , 2010 , on VEVO and <unk> . According to Mandler , the original idea for the video was citing Max Headroom , a fictional artificial intelligence character from 1980s British television and film . The reference is made when Usher is seen on a flickering television at the beginning of the video . Mandler specified , commenting , " Max Headroom was always in his room , " he continued , " this unidentifiable room , ' 80s shapes . I used that for inspiration . " Usher stated that he wanted to do something theatrical and fun , and that while will.i.am. brought the international sound , he wanted to bring the producer into his world , " working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists , but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible . " Mandler described the visuals in the clip as " Hitchcock @-@ ian " , as well as simply <unk> Usher in his element , as he said he wanted the R & B singer 's talent to take over . He further explained , stating , 
 " The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where he does what I think he does better than anyone else in the world , which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us , the viewer , whether audible or visually , on a journey , not a ride . And , in that , I wanted to create an unpredictability , so one set leads to another and another , and you never know what 's gonna happen . Along the way , Usher becomes our guide . We 're so focused on him , we don 't notice the change . The thing is unfolding little by little , and you can 't quite see far enough ahead to know what 's gonna come next . " 
 = = = Synopsis and reception = = = 
 The video begins with Usher flickering on a television in a room , before we see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights , and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights . Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room . In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens . Usher then dances outside in front of a concrete wall , with male background dancers appearing as shadows . As will.i.am. performs his verse , he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights . After this , Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena @-@ like area , whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights on the floor , with the video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television . 
 In a review of the video , Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly said , " For a song with such a title , it sure does take a minute for its video to build up to wow @-@ worthy moments . After some clean dance sequences , the magic begins . Usher grooves with shadows , puffs out O ’ s with cigar smoke , and then links back up with his ladies on a primary colored dance floor to show off his steps . " Chris Ryan of MTV News compared the video 's flashing lights to the music video for " Yeah ! " , and called the song an answer track to Trey Songz 's " LOL " . At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards , the clip was nominated for Best Dance Video , Best Choreography , and Best Male Video .

 Usher performed the song with will.i.am. on the ninth season of American Idol , appearing in a black bowler and matching black suit with silver lapels , accompanied by flames and other pyrotechnics . They then performed the song together on The Oprah Winfrey Show on May 10 , 2010 . The song has also been performed live in Australia on Hey Hey it 's Saturday on May 19 , 2010 , as well as on Sunrise on May 21 , 2010 . Usher later performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show , So You Think You Can Dance , Good Morning America and live in the United Kingdom on Britain 's Got Talent . On August 6 , 2010 , he performed the song alongside other hits at his New Look Foundation ’ s inaugural World Leadership Awards in Atlanta , where his protege Justin Bieber and R & B singer Ciara also performed . Another event the song was performed at was the Activision E3 Event . The song was performed alongside " DJ Got Us Fallin ' in Love " during the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards . VMA executive producer Dave <unk> told MTV News , " We said to him , ' We want to do the best televised dance routine that you 've done in years . Let 's show why you 're the king . ' " MTV Buzzworthy writer , Tamar Antai was present at the rehearsal for the show , and commented that the VMA crew was about to " pull off visual feats not just previously unseen and unparalleled at the VMAs , but unseen and unparalleled on TV . " 
 The performance was received with critical acclaim . On Usher specifically Antai said the performance was like " liquid magic " , saying , " He took it to the level that comes after the next level . The penthouse level . " He was aided by about a dozen background dancers , the males in skeleton @-@ like <unk> , and the females donning a one @-@ piece , gloves and boots . The " OMG " performance was accompanied by red laser lights , making an illusion as if the stage disappeared . The lights spelled out " <unk> " as well as " Usher " , as dancers lowered from the ceiling . Jayson <unk> of MTV News commented , " The singer moved and grooved , proving that he 's the R & B star that everyone pays attention to for the big moments . " Rochell D. Thomas , also of the site said " Call it what you will : talent , swag , skills ... When he steps on the dance floor , some mysterious thing comes out of him and puts the G in groove . " Thomas went on to say that Usher 's dance moves would make " the late great Michael Jackson jealous " in the stage production " that included more special @-@ effects bells and whistles than a summer blockbuster . " Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy also compared the performance to Jackson , calling it overall , " One part " Tron , " one part laser show , one part Michael Jackson <unk> tribute , and all spectacle . " Usher appeared with The Black Eyed Peas to perform the song during the halftime show of Super Bowl XLV .

 = Clavaria fragilis = 
 Clavaria fragilis , commonly known as fairy fingers , white worm coral , or white spindles , is a species of fungus in the family Clavariaceae . It is synonymous with Clavaria vermicularis . The fungus is the type species of the genus Clavaria and is a typical member of the clavarioid or club fungi . It produces tubular , unbranched , white basidiocarps ( fruit bodies ) that typically grow in clusters . The fruit bodies can reach dimensions of 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) tall by 0 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 in ) thick . Clavaria fragilis is a saprobic species , growing in woodland litter or in old , unimproved grassland . It is widespread throughout temperate regions in the Northern Hemisphere , but has also been reported from Australia and South Africa . The fungus is edible , but insubstantial and flavorless . There are several other small white coral @-@ like fungi with which C. fragilis may be confused . 
 = = History and taxonomy = = 
 Clavaria fragilis was originally described from Denmark in 1790 by Danish naturalist and mycologist Theodor Holmskjold , and was sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum . The Latin epithet fragilis refers to the brittle fruit bodies . The species was redescribed by Swedish mycologist Olof Swartz in 1811 , using the name Clavaria vermicularis ( the epithet meaning " wormlike " ) . Though it is a later synonym — and thus obsolete according to the principle of priority — the latter name is still frequently used today . There are several other names considered to be synonymous with C. fragilis by the online taxonomical database MycoBank ( see the <unk> ) . 
 In North America , the fungus has colloquially been called " fairy fingers " or " white worm coral " . In the UK its recommended English name is " white spindles " . British naturalist Samuel Frederick Gray called it the " worm club @-@ stool " in his 1821 A Natural Arrangement of British Plants . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of C. fragilis are irregularly tubular , smooth to furrowed , sometimes compressed , very fragile , white , up to 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) tall by 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) thick , and typically grow in dense clusters . The tip of the fruit body tapers to a point , and may yellow and curve with age . There is no distinct stalk , although it is evident as a short , semitransparent zone of tissue at the base of the club . Microscopically , the hyphae of the flesh are swollen up to 12 µm wide and lack clamp connections . The spores are smooth , colourless , ellipsoid to oblong , measuring 5 – 7 by 3 – 4 µm . The spores are white in deposit . The basidia ( spore bearing cells ) measure 40 – 50 by 6 – 8 µm , and lack clamps at their bases . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Clavaria fragilis is edible , but the fruit bodies are insubstantial and fragile . One field guide says " its flesh is tasteless and so delicate that it seems to dissolve in one 's mouth . " Its odor has been compared to iodine . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The species occurs throughout the Northern Hemisphere , in Europe , North America , and Asia . In North America , it is more common east of the Rocky Mountains . It has also been recorded from Australia and South Africa . In 2006 , it was reported from the Arctic zone of the Ural Mountains , in Russia . 
 The fungus grows in woodland and in grassland on moist soil , and is presumed to be saprobic , rotting fallen leaf litter and dead grass stems . The fruit bodies tend to grow in groups , tufts or clusters . Although they can grow singly , they are typically inconspicuous unless in clusters . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 Similar fungi with simple , white fruit bodies include Clavaria acuta , an equally widespread species that typically grows singly or in small groups rather than in dense clusters and can be distinguished microscopically by its clamped basidia and larger spores ; the morphologically similar , but rare C. atkinsoniana , found in the southwestern and central United States , which cannot be distinguished from C. fragilis by field characteristics alone but has larger spores — 8 @.@ 5 – 10 by 4 @.@ 5 – 5 µm ; C. <unk> , another North American species , which is similar in stature but has a reddish tint ; and <unk> <unk> , a widespread lichenized species with smaller fruit bodies that occurs with its associated algae on moist wood . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 In North America , Clavaria fragilis has been called " by far our most common Clavaria " . In northern Europe , it is one of a suite of " CHEG " fungi ( CHEG standing for " <unk> fungi @-@ Hygrocybe @-@ Entoloma @-@ Geoglossaceae " ) considered to be indicator species of old , unimproved grassland ( permanent grassland that has not been cultivated for some years ) . Though such grasslands are a threatened habitat in Europe , C. fragilis is one of the commoner CHEG species . It is , nonetheless , on the national red list of threatened fungi in the Netherlands and Slovenia . 
 = Natural dye = 
 Natural dyes are dyes or colorants derived from plants , invertebrates , or minerals . The majority of natural dyes are vegetable dyes from plant sources — roots , berries , bark , leaves , and wood — and other organic sources such as fungi and lichens 
 Archaeologists have found evidence of textile dyeing dating back to the Neolithic period . In China , dyeing with plants , barks and insects has been traced back more than 5 @,@ 000 years . The essential process of dyeing changed little over time . Typically , the dye material is put in a pot of water and then the textiles to be dyed are added to the pot , which is heated and stirred until the color is transferred . Textile fibre may be dyed before spinning ( " dyed in the wool " ) , but most textiles are " yarn @-@ dyed " or " piece @-@ dyed " after weaving . Many natural dyes require the use of chemicals called mordants to bind the dye to the textile fibres ; tannin from oak galls , salt , natural alum , vinegar , and ammonia from stale urine were used by early dyers . Many mordants , and some dyes themselves , produce strong odors , and large @-@ scale <unk> were often isolated in their own districts . 
 Throughout history , people have dyed their textiles using common , locally available materials , but scarce dyestuffs that produced brilliant and permanent colors such as the natural invertebrate dyes , Tyrian purple and crimson kermes , became highly prized luxury items in the ancient and medieval world . Plant @-@ based dyes such as woad ( <unk> tinctoria ) , indigo , saffron , and madder were raised commercially and were important trade goods in the economies of Asia and Europe . Across Asia and Africa , patterned fabrics were produced using resist dyeing techniques to control the absorption of color in piece @-@ dyed cloth . Dyes such as cochineal and logwood ( <unk> <unk> ) were brought to Europe by the Spanish treasure fleets , and the dyestuffs of Europe were carried by colonists to America . 
 The discovery of man @-@ made synthetic dyes in the mid @-@ 19th century triggered a long decline in the large @-@ scale market for natural dyes . Synthetic dyes , which could be produced in large quantities , quickly superseded natural dyes for the commercial textile production enabled by the industrial revolution , and unlike natural dyes , were suitable for the synthetic fibres that followed . Artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement preferred the pure shades and subtle variability of natural dyes , which mellow with age but preserve their true colors , unlike early synthetic dyes , and helped ensure that the old European techniques for dyeing and printing with natural dyestuffs were preserved for use by home and craft dyers . Natural dyeing techniques are also preserved by artisans in traditional cultures around the world . 
 In the early 21st century , the market for natural dyes in the fashion industry is experiencing a resurgence . Western consumers have become more concerned about the health and environmental impact of synthetic dyes in manufacturing and there is a growing demand for products that use natural dyes . The European Union , for example , has encouraged Indonesian batik cloth producers to switch to natural dyes to improve their export market in Europe .

 Fibre content determines the type of dye required for a fabric : 
 Cellulose fibres : cotton , linen , hemp , <unk> , bamboo , rayon 
 Protein fibres : wool , angora , mohair , cashmere , silk , soy , leather , suede 
 Cellulose fibres require fibre @-@ reactive , direct / substantive , and vat dyes , which are colourless , soluble dyes fixed by light and / or oxygen . Protein fibres require vat , acid , or indirect / mordant dyes , that require a bonding agent . Each synthetic fibre requires its own dyeing method , for example , nylon requires acid , disperse and pigment dyes , rayon acetate requires disperse dyes , and so on . The types of natural dyes currently in use by the global fashion industry include :

 Colors in the " ruddy " range of reds , browns , and oranges are the first attested colors in a number of ancient textile sites ranging from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age across the Levant , Egypt , Mesopotamia and Europe , followed by evidence of blues and then yellows , with green appearing somewhat later . The earliest surviving evidence of textile dyeing was found at the large Neolithic settlement at Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia , where traces of red dyes , possible from ochre ( iron oxide pigments from clay ) , were found . Polychrome or multicolored fabrics seem to have been developed in the 3rd or 2nd millennium BCE . Textiles with a " red @-@ brown warp and an ochre @-@ yellow weft " were discovered in Egyptian pyramids of the Sixth Dynasty ( 2345 – 2180 BCE ) . 
 The chemical analysis that would definitively identify the dyes used in ancient textiles has rarely been conducted , and even when a dye such as indigo blue is detected it is impossible to determine which of several indigo @-@ bearing plants was used . Nevertheless , based on the colors of surviving textile fragments and the evidence of actual dyestuffs found in archaeological sites , reds , blues , and yellows from plant sources were in common use by the late Bronze Age and Iron Age . 
 In the 18th century Jeremias Friedrich <unk> made substantial contributions to refining the dyeing process , making particular progress on setting standards on dyeing sheep wool and many other textiles . His contributions to refining the dying process and his theories on colour brought much praise by the well known poet and artist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . 
 = = Processes = = 
 The essential process of dyeing requires soaking the material containing the dye ( the dyestuff ) in water , adding the textile to be dyed to the resulting solution ( the <unk> ) , and bringing the solution to a simmer for an extended period , often measured in days or even weeks , stirring occasionally until the color has evenly transferred to the textiles . 
 Some dyestuffs , such as indigo and lichens , will give good color when used alone ; these dyes are called direct dyes or substantive dyes . The majority of plant dyes , however , also require the use of a mordant , a chemical used to " fix " the color in the textile fibres . These dyes are called adjective dyes . By using different mordants , dyers can often obtain a variety of colors and shades from the same dye . Fibres or cloth may be <unk> with mordants , or the mordant may be incorporated in the <unk> . In traditional dyeing , the common mordants are vinegar , tannin from oak bark , sumac or oak galls , ammonia from stale urine , and wood @-@ ash liquor or potash ( potassium carbonate ) made by leaching wood ashes and evaporating the solution . 
 We shall never know by what chances primitive man discovered that salt , vinegar from fermenting fruit , natural alum , and stale urine helped to fix and enhance the colours of his yarns , but for many centuries these four substances were used as mordants . 
 Salt helps to " fix " or increase " fastness " of colors , vinegar improves reds and purples , and the ammonia in stale urine assists in the fermentation of indigo dyes . Natural alum ( aluminum sulfate ) is the most common metallic salt mordant , but tin ( <unk> chloride ) , copper ( cupric sulfate ) , iron ( ferrous sulfate , called <unk> ) and chrome ( potassium dichromate ) are also used . Iron mordants " sadden " colors , while tin and chrome mordants brighten colors . The iron mordants contribute to fabric deterioration , referred to as " dye rot " . Additional chemicals or <unk> may be applied after dying to further alter or reinforce the colors . 
 Textiles may be dyed as raw fibre ( dyed in the fleece or dyed in the wool ) , as spun yarn ( dyed in the hank or yarn @-@ dyed ) , or after weaving ( piece @-@ dyed ) . <unk> often leave residue in wool fibre that makes it difficult to spin , so wool was generally dyed after spinning , as yarn or woven cloth . Indigo , however , requires no mordant , and cloth manufacturers in medieval England often dyed wool in the fleece with the indigo @-@ bearing plant woad and then dyed the cloth again after weaving to produce deep blues , browns , reds , purples , blacks , and <unk> . 
 In China , Japan , India , Pakistan , Nigeria , Gambia , and other parts of West Africa and southeast Asia , patterned silk and cotton fabrics were produced using resist dyeing techniques in which the cloth is printed or stenciled with starch or wax , or tied in various ways to prevent even penetration of the dye when the cloth is piece @-@ dyed . The Chinese <unk> process is dated to the 10th century ; other traditional techniques include tie @-@ dye , batik , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 The mordants used in dyeing and many dyestuffs themselves give off strong and unpleasant odors , and the actual process of dyeing requires a good supply of fresh water , storage areas for bulky plant materials , vats which can be kept heated ( often for days or weeks ) along with the necessary fuel , and airy spaces to dry the dyed textiles . Ancient large @-@ scale dye @-@ works tended to be located on the outskirts of populated areas , on windy promontories .

 A variety of plants produce red dyes , including a number of lichens , henna , <unk> or dyer 's <unk> ( <unk> tinctoria ) , <unk> and dyer 's madder Rubia <unk> . Madder and related plants of the genus Rubia are native to many temperate zones around the world , and were already used as sources of good red dye , such as rose madder , in prehistory . Madder has been identified on linen in the tomb of Tutankhamun , and Pliny the Elder records madder growing near Rome . Madder was a dye of commercial importance in Europe , being cultivated in the Netherlands and France to dye the red coats of military uniforms until the market collapsed following the development of synthetic <unk> dye in 1869 . Madder was also used to dye the " hunting pinks " of Great Britain . 
 Turkey red was a strong , very fast red dye for cotton obtained from madder root via a complicated multistep process involving " sumac and oak galls , calf 's blood , sheep 's dung , oil , soda , alum , and a solution of tin . " Turkey red was developed in India and spread to Turkey . Greek workers familiar with the methods of its production were brought to France in 1747 , and Dutch and English spies soon discovered the secret . A sanitized version of Turkey red was being produced in Manchester by 1784 , and roller @-@ printed dress cottons with a Turkey red ground were fashionable in England by the 1820s . 
 <unk> or Indian madder ( Rubia <unk> ) is native to the Himalayas and other mountains of Asia and Japan . <unk> was an important dye for the Asian cotton industry and is still used by craft dyers in Nepal . 
 <unk> or bloodroot ( <unk> canadensis ) is a popular red dye among Southeastern Native American <unk> . Choctaw <unk> additionally use sumac for red dye . <unk> artists from Texas and Louisiana used the water oak ( Quercus nigra L. ) to produce red .

 Dyes that create reds and yellows can also yield oranges . Navajo dyers create orange dyes from one @-@ seeded juniper , Juniperus <unk> , Navajo tea , <unk> gracile , or alder bark . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Yellow dyes are " about as numerous as red ones " , and can be extracted from saffron , pomegranate rind , turmeric , safflower , <unk> , and a number of weedy flowering plants . Limited evidence suggests the use of weld ( Reseda <unk> ) , also called <unk> or dyer 's rocket before the Iron Age , but it was an important dye of the ancient Mediterranean and Europe and is indigenous to England . Two brilliant yellow dyes of commercial importance in Europe from the 18th century are derived from trees of the Americas : <unk> from the inner bark of Eastern Black Oak ( Quercus velutina ) , ] native to eastern North America and <unk> from the dyer 's mulberry tree ( <unk> tinctoria ) of the West Indies and Mexico . 
 In <unk> <unk> among Southeastern Woodlands tribes in the Americas , butternut ( Juglans cinerea ) and yellow root ( <unk> <unk> ) provide a rich yellow color . <unk> basket weavers have a complex formula for yellow that employs a dock plant ( most likely <unk> crispus ) for yellow . Navajo artists create yellow dyes from small snake @-@ weed , brown onion skins , and rubber plant ( <unk> <unk> ) . <unk> ( <unk> ) and rose hips produce pale , yellow @-@ cream colored dyes . 
 = = = Greens = = = 
 If plants that yield yellow dyes are common , plants that yield green dyes are rare . Both woad and indigo have been used since ancient times in combination with yellow dyes to produce shades of green . Medieval and Early Modern England was especially known for its green dyes . The dyers of Lincoln , a great cloth town in the high Middle Ages , produced the Lincoln green cloth associated with Robin Hood by dyeing wool with woad and then <unk> it yellow with weld or dyer 's <unk> ( Genista tinctoria ) , also known as dyer 's broom . Woolen cloth <unk> with alum and dyed yellow with dyer 's <unk> was <unk> with woad and , later , indigo , to produce the once @-@ famous Kendal green . This in turn fell out of fashion in the 18th century in favor of the brighter Saxon green , dyed with indigo and <unk> . 
 Soft olive greens are also achieved when textiles dyed yellow are treated with an iron mordant . The dull green cloth common to the Iron Age <unk> culture shows traces of iron , and was possibly colored by boiling yellow @-@ dyed cloth in an iron pot . Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau in North America used lichen to dye corn husk bags a sea green . 
 Navajo textile artist <unk> Gorman Bryan developed a two @-@ step process for creating green dye . First the Churro wool yarn is dyed yellow with sagebrush , Artemisia tridentata , and then it is soaked in black dye <unk> . Red onion skins are also used by Navajo dyers to produce green . 
 = = = Blues = = = 
 Blue colorants around the world were derived from indigo dye @-@ bearing plants , primarily those in the genus Indigofera , which are native to the tropics . The primary commercial indigo species in Asia was true indigo ( Indigofera tinctoria ) . India is believed to be the oldest center of indigo dyeing in the Old World . It was a primary supplier of indigo dye to Europe as early as the Greco @-@ Roman era . The association of India with indigo is reflected in the Greek word for the dye , which was <unk> ( <unk> ) . The Romans used the term indicum , which passed into Italian dialect and eventually into English as the word indigo . 
 In Central and South America , the important blue dyes were <unk> ( Indigofera <unk> ) and Natal indigo ( Indigofera <unk> ) . 
 In temperate climates including Europe , indigo was obtained primarily from woad ( <unk> tinctoria ) , an indigenous plant of Assyria and the Levant which has been grown in Northern Europe over 2 @,@ 000 years , although from the 18th century it was mostly replaced by superior Indian indigo imported by the British East India Company . <unk> was carried to New England in the 17th century and used extensively in America until native stands of indigo were discovered in Florida and the Carolinas . In Sumatra , indigo dye is extracted from some species of <unk> . Other indigo @-@ bearing dye plants include dyer 's knotweed ( Polygonum <unk> ) from Japan and the coasts of China , and the West African shrub <unk> cyanescens .

 In medieval Europe , purple , violet , <unk> and similar colors were produced by dyeing wool with woad or indigo in the fleece and then piece @-@ dyeing the woven cloth with red dyes , either the common madder or the luxury dyes kermes and cochineal . Madder could also produce purples when used with alum . <unk> also gave purple shades with vitriol ( sulfuric acid ) or potash . 
 Choctaw artists traditionally used maple ( Acer sp . ) to create lavender and purple dyes . Purples can also be derived from lichens , and from the berries of White Bryony from the northern Rocky Mountain states and mulberry ( <unk> nigra ) ( with an acid mordant ) .

 Miriam C. Rice , ( 1918 — 2010 ) of Mendocino , California , pioneered research into using various mushrooms for natural dyes . She discovered mushroom dyes for a complete rainbow palette .

Hypholoma <unk> provides a yellow dye , and fungi such as Phaeolus <unk> and Pisolithus tinctorius are used in dyeing textiles and paper . 
 = = Luxury dyestuffs = = 
 From the second millennium BC to the 19th century , a succession of rare and expensive natural dyestuffs came in and out of fashion in the ancient world and then in Europe . In many cases the cost of these dyes far exceeded the cost of the wools and silks they colored , and often only the finest grades of fabrics were considered worthy of the best dyes . 
 = = = Royal purple = = = 
 The premier luxury dye of the ancient world was Tyrian purple or royal purple , a purple @-@ red dye which is extracted from several genera of sea snails , primarily the spiny dye @-@ murex Murex <unk> ( currently known as <unk> <unk> ) . Murex dye was greatly prized in antiquity because it did not fade , but instead became brighter and more intense with weathering and sunlight . Murex dyeing may have been developed first by the Minoans of East Crete or the West Semites along the Levantine coast , and heaps of crushed murex shells have been discovered at a number of locations along the eastern Mediterranean dated to the mid @-@ 2nd millennium BC . The classical dye known as Phoenician Red was also derived from murex snails . 
 Murex dyes were fabulously expensive – one snail yields but a single drop of dye – and the Roman Empire imposed a strict monopoly on their use from the reign of Alexander Severus ( AD 225 – 235 ) that was maintained by the succeeding Byzantine Empire until the Early Middle Ages . The dye was used for imperial manuscripts on purple parchment , often with text in silver or gold , and <unk> or " born in the purple " was a term for Byzantine offspring of a reigning Emperor . The color matched the increasingly rare purple rock porphyry , also associated with the imperial family . 
 = = = Crimson and scarlet = = = 
 Tyrian purple retained its place as the premium dye of Europe until it was replaced " in status and desirability " by the rich crimson reds and scarlets of the new silk @-@ weaving centers of Italy , colored with kermes . Kermes is extracted from the dried unlaid eggs of the insect Kermes <unk> or <unk> <unk> found on species of oak ( especially the Kermes oak of the Mediterranean region ) . The dye is of ancient origin ; jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave @-@ burial at <unk> , Bouches @-@ du @-@ Rhône . Similar dyes are extracted from the related insects Porphyrophora <unk> ( Armenian cochineal ) of the Caucasus region , Porphyrophora polonica ( Polish cochineal or Saint John 's blood ) of Eastern Europe , and the lac @-@ producing insects of India , Southeast Asia , China , and Tibet . 
 When kermes @-@ dyed textiles achieved prominence around the mid @-@ 11th century , the dyestuff was called " grain " in all Western European languages because the desiccated eggs resemble fine grains of wheat or sand . Textiles dyed with kermes were described as dyed in the grain . <unk> were frequently dyed in the fleece with woad and then piece @-@ dyed in kermes , producing a wide range colors from blacks and grays through browns , <unk> , purples , and <unk> . By the 14th and early 15th century , brilliant full grain kermes scarlet was " by far the most esteemed , most regal " color for luxury woollen textiles in the Low Countries , England , France , Spain and Italy . 
 Cochineal ( <unk> coccus ) is a scale insect of Central and North America from which the crimson @-@ coloured dye carmine is derived . It was used by the Aztec and Maya peoples . Moctezuma in the 15th century collected tribute in the form of bags of cochineal dye . Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire cochineal began to be exported to Spain , and by the seventeenth century it was a commodity traded as far away as India . During the colonial period the production of cochineal ( in Spanish , grana <unk> ) grew rapidly . Produced almost exclusively in Oaxaca by indigenous producers , cochineal became Mexico 's second most valued export after silver . Cochineal produces purplish colors alone and brilliant scarlets when <unk> with tin ; thus cochineal , which produced a stronger dye and could thus be used in smaller quantities , replaced kermes dyes in general use in Europe from the 17th century .

 During the course of the 15th century , the civic records show brilliant reds falling out of fashion for civic and high @-@ status garments in the Duchy of Burgundy in favor of dark blues , greens , and most important of all , black . The origins of the trend for somber colors are elusive , but are generally attributed to the growing influence of Spain and possibly the importation of Spanish merino wools . The trend spread in the next century : the Low Countries , German states , Scandinavia , England , France , and Italy all absorbed the sobering and formal influence of Spanish dress after the mid @-@ 1520s . 
 Producing fast black in the Middle Ages was a complicated process involving multiple <unk> with woad or indigo followed by <unk> , but at the dawn of Early Modern period , a new and superior method of dyeing black dye reached Europe via Spanish conquests in the New World . The new method used logwood ( <unk> <unk> ) , a <unk> native to Mexico and Central America . Although logwood was poorly received at first , producing a blue inferior to that of woad and indigo , it was discovered to produce a fast black in combination with a ferrous sulfate ( <unk> ) mordant . Despite changing fashions in color , logwood was the most widely used dye by the 19th century , providing the sober blacks of formal and mourning clothes .

 The first synthetic dyes were discovered in the mid @-@ 19th century , starting with William Henry Perkin 's <unk> in 1856 , an aniline dye derived from coal tar . <unk> , the red dye present in madder , was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically , in 1869 , leading to the collapse of the market for naturally grown madder . The development of new , strongly colored aniline dyes followed quickly : a range of reddish @-@ purples , blues , violets , greens and reds became available by 1880 . These dyes had great affinity for animal fibres such as wool and silk . The new colors tended to fade and wash out , but they were inexpensive and could be produced in the vast quantities required by textile production in the industrial revolution . By the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was fast disappearing . 
 At the same time the Pre @-@ Raphaelite artist and founding figure of the Arts and Crafts movement William Morris took up the art of dyeing as an adjunct to his manufacturing business , the design firm of Morris & Co . Always a medievalist at heart , Morris loathed the colors produced by the fashionable aniline dyes . He spent much of his time at his Staffordshire dye works mastering the processes of dyeing with plant materials and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods . One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of natural dyes like madder which had been driven almost out of use by the commercial success of the anilines . Morris saw dyeing of wools , silks , and cottons as the necessary preliminary to the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence ; and his period of incessant work at the dye @-@ vat ( 1875 – 76 ) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles ( 1877 – 78 ) , and more especially in the revival of <unk> and tapestry @-@ weaving as fine arts . Morris & Co. also provided naturally dyed silks for the embroidery style called art needlework . 
 Scientists continued to search for new synthetic dyes that would be effective on cellulose fibres like cotton and linen , and that would be more <unk> on wool and silk than the early anilines . Chrome or mordant dyes produced a muted but very fast color range for woollens . These were followed by acid dyes for animal fibres ( from 1875 ) and the synthesis of indigo in Germany in 1880 . The work on indigo led to the development of a new class of dyes called vat dyes in 1901 that produced a wide range of fast colors for vegetable fibres . <unk> dyes were introduced in 1923 to color the new textiles of cellulose acetate , which could not be colored with any existing dyes . Today disperse dyes are the only effective means of coloring many synthetics . Reactive dyes for both wool and cotton were introduced in the mid @-@ 1950s , and are used both in commercial textile production and in craft dyeing . 
 In America , synthetic dyes became popular among a wide range of Native American textile artists ; however , natural dyes remained in use , as many textile collectors prefer natural dyes over synthetics . Today , dyeing with natural materials is often practiced as an adjunct to <unk> , knitting and weaving . It remains a living craft in many traditional cultures of North America , Africa , Asia , and the Scottish Highlands .

 Random Access Memories is the fourth studio album by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk , released on 17 May 2013 by the duo 's imprint Daft Life and Columbia Records . The album pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 1980s era of music in the United States , particularly the sounds of said era that emerged from Los Angeles . This theme was reflected in the promotional campaign for the album that included billboards , television advertisements and a web series , as well as in the album 's packaging . Unlike their previous albums , Daft Punk recruited session musicians to perform live instrumentation in professional recording locations , and limited the use of electronic instruments to usage of drum machines , a custom @-@ built modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders . The album features collaborations with Giorgio Moroder , Panda Bear , Julian Casablancas , Todd Edwards , DJ Falcon , Chilly Gonzales , Nile Rodgers , Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams . It is the first album by the duo to be released by Columbia Records . 
 Random Access Memories received critical acclaim upon release , scoring an 87 out of 100 on review aggregator site Metacritic and frequently appearing on many music critics ' year @-@ end lists . It has also become one of Daft Punk 's most commercially successful albums to date , topping the charts in more than 25 countries worldwide . It debuted at # 1 on the Billboard 200 in the United States , selling more than 339 @,@ 000 copies within its first week , becoming their highest charting album to date and their first to top the Billboard 200 chart . The album 's lead single " Get Lucky " became a critical and commercial success worldwide , topping the charts in more than 30 countries worldwide and becoming one of the best @-@ selling digital singles of all time . The album later won Grammy Awards for Album of the Year , Best Dance / Electronica Album and Best Engineered Album , Non @-@ Classical , and " Get Lucky " won for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo / Group Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014 .

 Shortly after finishing off their Alive 2006 / 2007 tour , Daft Punk began working on new material in 2008 . Thomas Bangalter of the duo recalled , " the two of us would go in with a lot of keyboards , guitars , drums , and stuff and started to do demos for six , seven months . " Daft Punk were pleased with the work in terms of composition , but were dissatisfied with the production aspect , as they relied on samples and loops of their own performances : " We could play some riffs and stuff but not keep it [ up ] for four minutes straight . " Daft Punk put these demos aside and started work on the Tron : Legacy film soundtrack later in 2008 . As Bangalter mentioned after the film 's release in 2010 : " Making music for a movie is very humbling . We ’ ve been working on some of our music concurrently . " Daft Punk then decided to work extensively with live musicians on what would become Random Access Memories : " We wanted to do what we used to do with machines and samplers , but with people . " They avoided the use of samples on the album , with the exception of the closing track " Contact " . 
 The album features Chic frontman Nile Rodgers , who commented that a collaboration was " something we 've [ Daft Punk and Rodgers ] talked about for a long time . We 've respected each other endlessly . " Daft Punk eventually visited Rodgers ' home for an informal jam session , and an official collaboration was later confirmed and completed . Musician Paul Williams announced in a 2010 interview that he had worked with the group , after Daft Punk had been introduced to Williams by a sound engineer with whom they were mutually acquainted . 
 In May 2012 Daft Punk 's collaboration with Giorgio Moroder was announced — Moroder had recorded a monologue about his life for use in a track on the album . Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session . Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer : " They did not let me get involved at all . Thomas asked me if I wanted to tell the story of my life . Then they would know what to do with it . " Daft Punk had been in contact with Moroder in relation to a possible contribution for the Tron : Legacy score , but this never happened . 
 Chilly Gonzales stated in an interview that his contribution was recorded in a one @-@ day session : " I played for hours and they 're gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever . " He explained that Daft Punk prompted him at the piano in the same manner that a film director coaches an actor , and Gonzales left the Los Angeles studio without knowledge of what the final product would sound like . He had previously recorded a cover version of Daft Punk 's song " Too Long " that appeared on the duo 's 2003 album Daft Club . 
 Pharrell Williams collaborated with Daft Punk and Rodgers by providing vocals for two tracks on Random Access Memories . As a member of the Neptunes , Pharrell had previously provided a remix of " Harder , Better , Faster , Stronger " that appeared on Daft Club . The Neptunes and Daft Punk also co @-@ produced N.E.R.D. ' s song " Hypnotize U " . 
 = = = Recording = = = 
 Recording took place at Henson Recording Studios , Conway Recording Studios and Capitol Studios in California , Electric Lady Studios in New York City , and Gang Recording Studio in Paris , France . Having worked with keyboardist and arranger Chris Caswell on Tron : Legacy , the duo enlisted him and connected with engineers and other session players for their next album . Daft Punk recalled that they wished to avoid the more compressed sounds of drum machines in favor of " airy open " drum sets of the 1970s and 80s , which the duo consider the most appealing era . Bangalter clarified that " it 's not that we can 't make crazy futuristic sounding stuff , but we wanted to play with the past " . The duo noted that the session players were enthusiastic to reunite in the context of the new album and the perceived prestige of the studio locations . 
 Drummer Omar Hakim recalled being asked by Daft Punk to perform on the album , and was surprised by what they wanted of him . He at first assumed that the duo wanted electronic drum work , since Hakim had done some drum programming in his career . Daft Punk instead specified that they were looking to record Hakim performing acoustic drum riffs that the duo had conceived . Rather than play out the entire structure of a song , Hakim would perform individual patterns for extended periods , thus creating a library for the duo to cull from . Daft Punk conveyed their ideas to session musicians via sheet music and in some instances by humming melodies . Bangalter recalled an example in which he hummed a complex drum and bass line to Hakim , who replicated and improved upon it for the track " Giorgio by Moroder " . 
 Most of the vocal sessions took place in Paris , whereas the rhythm sections were recorded in the United States . The album incorporates a variety of accompanying performances including a horn section , woodwind instruments , a string orchestra and choir . Orchestral parts in particular were recorded for almost every track , but were only included on a few songs in the final product . The use of such performers and places came at great monetary expense , as noted by Bangalter : " There used to be a time where people that had means to experiment would do it , you know ? That 's what this record is about . " He estimated a cost of over one million dollars , but felt that the number was not important . Bangalter stated that the sessions were financed by Daft Punk themselves , which allowed them the luxury of abandoning the project if they had so wished . He also specified that " there are songs on the album that traveled into five studios over two and a half years . " 
 Various sound effects were newly recorded with the help of film experts from Warner Bros. Bangalter noted one example in which the sound of a busy restaurant was achieved by placing microphones in front of the forks of a group of people . In another instance , the effect of dripping water was recorded on a soundstage . Use of electronics was limited to drum machines that appear on only two tracks , a large custom @-@ built <unk> modular synthesizer performed live by the duo , and vintage vocoders . When asked which of the two Daft Punk members performed the robotic vocals on the album , Bangalter expressed that it did not matter . The duo produced most of the vocoder tracks in their own private studio in Paris , with later processing done by Mick Guzauski at Capitol . Moroder elaborated that Daft Punk would take " a week or so " to find an adequate vocoder sound , and an additional few days to record the lyrics . 
 Although the duo felt that the presets and parameters of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation , they admitted that Random Access Memories could not have been made in the complete absence of computer technology . The sessions were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks ; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations , deciding which of the two they preferred . Subsequently the elements were edited by the duo with Pro Tools in a manner similar to how they would work with samples . 
 In an interview conducted in November 2012 by Guitar World magazine , <unk> member Nathan East mentioned that he had contributed to the project . The percussionist Quinn also stated that he performed on " every drum [ he ] own [ s ] " for the album . Pedal steel guitar work on the record was performed by Greg Leisz . Daft Punk sought to use the instrument in a way that bordered between electronic and acoustic . Additional session players include John " J.R. " Robinson , Paul Jackson , Jr . , James Genus , Thomas Bloch and Chris Caswell .

 Bangalter described the album 's title as encapsulating Daft Punk 's interest in the past , referencing both random @-@ access memory technology and the human experience : " We were drawing a parallel between the brain and the hard drive – the random way that memories are stored . " Daft Punk felt that while current technology allows for an unlimited capacity to store recorded material , the content produced by contemporary artists had diminished in quality . Their goal was therefore to maximize the potential of infinite storage by recording a sprawling amount of elements . The duo pointed to the process as being further inspiration for the album 's title , as they sought to make connections out of the random series of ideas . 
 Regarding the style of the album , they sought a " west coast vibe " , referencing such acts as Fleetwood Mac , the Doobie Brothers and the Eagles . Daft Punk also acknowledged that the record pays homage to Michael Jackson , the Cars and Steely Dan . The recording of live synthesizer parts was done in a progressive rock fashion , with the pop sensibilities of Wizzard and the Move . Daft Punk specifically looked to the album Rumours by Fleetwood Mac and The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd as models . Bangalter felt that " the most important records in music , whether it 's Led Zeppelin [ ... ] or The White Album or Sgt. Pepper 's ... or Quadrophenia or Tommy , are the ones that take you on a journey for miles and miles . " 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 The initial demos of Random Access Memories were created without a clear plan for an album . Over the course of the sessions , numerous tracks were created and discarded . At one point Daft Punk had considered sorting the entire album into one continuous track , similar to the Prince record <unk> . They had also considered releasing it as a four @-@ disc box set to accommodate the large volume of content produced . Thus the album lacked structure until the final months of production . 
 The opening track , " Give Life Back to Music " , features guitar work by Rodgers and Paul Jackson , Jr . , drums by John " J.R. " Robinson , and lyrics performed by Daft Punk using vocoders . The song reflects the duo 's goal to create a light yet polished and elegant record . As stated by NME , the album begins with " a stupendously vast rock intro that obliterates any trace of Human After All 's brittle techno " . The following track , " The Game of Love " , also features vocoder singing by the duo . Bangalter said , " There ’ s this thing today where the recorded human voice is processed to try to feel robotic . " He explained that the duo 's intention was to produce robotic vocals with expressiveness and emotion . " Giorgio by Moroder " was created to serve as a metaphor about musical freedom . The duo believed that a monologue by Moroder about his career would be an analogue for music 's history regarding exploration of genres and tastes . 
 " Within " was one of the first tracks to be recorded for the album . It features Gonzales on piano with minimal accompaniment consisting of bass and a percussion track , as well as vocoder . In the context of the album , " Within " marks the transition from the key of A minor of the previous three songs , to the key of B @-@ flat minor of subsequent tracks . Regarding the lyrics , critic Nick Stevenson observed , " A deep vocoder sings about not understanding the world , being lost and not even remembering his own name . " Jeremy Abbott of Mixmag added , " So many things I don 't understand is the prominent lyric and Chilly 's chords combined with grazing cymbals make for a beautiful summer lullaby . " 
 " Instant Crush " was based on a demo that Daft Punk presented to Julian Casablancas ; he became enthused upon hearing it and provided vocals . The song contains rock influences and a guitar solo . Critic John Balfe considered it " appropriately Strokes @-@ ish , even if [ Casablancas ' ] trademark drawl is fed quite substantially through a vocoder . " De Homem @-@ Christo noted , " It is true that it is not his usual register , it is the way Julian reacted to the track so for us it is even more exciting . " " Lose Yourself to Dance " features Pharrell Williams and was the result of a desire to create dance music with live drummers . To that end , Robinson appears as session player . A vocoder chant of " come on " appears in the song alongside Pharrell Williams 's singing . 
 " Touch " features lyrics written and performed by Paul Williams . Daft Punk noted that the song is the most complex piece on the record , being composed of over 250 elements . As Pitchfork observed , " the song warps and bends , floating through genres , epochs , and emotions with a sense of hallucinatory wonder " and recalls the Beatles song " A Day in the Life " . In Rolling Stone , Will Hermes observes , " It 's completely ridiculous . It 's also remarkably beautiful and affecting . " Louis <unk> of <unk> believed the multitude of styles and science fiction aesthetics on the track is an homage to musical films including Phantom of the Paradise , the soundtrack of which Williams had composed . The song 's opening is a specific reference to a scene in the film in which the title character 's voice is gradually enhanced in a studio booth . De Homem @-@ Christo stated that " Touch " is " like the core of the record , and the memories of the other tracks are revolving around it . " 
 " Get Lucky " is the second song on the album to feature Pharrell Williams , who clarified that the title phrase does not simply refer to a sexual act , but to the potential fortune of finding chemistry with another person . When he had first heard the song , Pharrell Williams said it evoked the image of a " peachy color [ ed ] " sunrise on an exotic island . Daft Punk discussed the concept of the song " Beyond " with Paul Williams , who then translated the ideas into lyrics for it . The track begins with an orchestral string section and timpani before settling into what NME called " reupholstered Warren G ' Regulate ' grooves " . Stevenson similarly described " Beyond " as " a lot like the sample used in Nate Dogg and Warren G ’ s ‘ Regulate ’ " , Michael McDonald 's song " I Keep <unk> ' " , which he noted as " no bad thing " , and stated that the vocoder @-@ affected lyrics detail " the existential world beyond oceans and mountains – a land beyond love . " 
 " <unk> " was described by Daft Punk as being " a futuristic composition that could be from the year 4000 " . A review elaborated that the instrumental piece can " carry you away like a track by Sébastien Tellier " . Todd Edwards commented that the lyrics of " Fragments of Time " were inspired by his desire to capture the moments he experienced during his visit to the duo 's studio sessions in California . " Doin ' It Right " was the last song to be recorded and features vocals performed by Panda Bear . The duo referred to it as the only purely electronic piece on the album , with a modern style . The closing track , " Contact " , is co @-@ produced by DJ Falcon and features a sample of the song " We Ride Tonight " by Australian rock band the <unk> . 
 The Japan @-@ exclusive bonus track " Horizon " , written by Bangalter and de Homem Christo , is a slow @-@ tempo composition reminiscent of Pink Floyd . It is characterized by a consistent guitar strum while several additional instruments are progressively layered over , including a bass guitar and drums . The song is stylistically different from other tracks on the album , and is one of the few to feature no lyrics . 
 = = Promotion and release = = 
 In January 2013 , de Homem @-@ Christo first revealed that Daft Punk was in the process of signing with Sony Music Entertainment through the Columbia Records label , and that the album would have a spring release . A report from The Guardian followed specifying a release date of May 2013 . On 26 February 2013 , Daft Punk 's official website and Facebook page announced the signing to Columbia with a picture of the duo 's helmets , and a " Columbia " logo in the corner . Billboards and posters featuring the helmets and logo then appeared in several major cities . 
 On 2 March , a 15 @-@ second television ad aired during Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) depicting an animated , stylized version of the band 's logo and the aforementioned image of the helmets . The music featured in the ad was a result of the collaboration with Rodgers , who noted that various fan remixes of the clip appeared online after the airing . A second TV ad also premiered that was similar to the first on Saturday Night Live , but with a different music clip and the title Random Access Memories in place of the stylized Daft Punk logo . During the first night of Coachella Festival 2013 , a third trailer debuted that featured Daft Punk , Pharrell Williams and Rodgers performing , as well as a list of collaborators on the album . The trailer also aired during Saturday Night Live the following evening , but without a list of collaborators . 
 The gradual rollout of promotion was inspired by advertising of the past , reflecting the theme of the album . Daft Punk approached Columbia with a specific agenda for the campaign ; Rob Stringer of the label recalled that the duo had showed him the book Rock ' n ' Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip as an example of what they wanted . Bangalter felt that physical billboards are more affecting than banner ads and that " SNL is this part of American culture with a certain timelessness to it . " The campaign was handled by a small group led by Daft Punk and manager Paul Hahn , with assistance from Kathryn Frazier of the public @-@ relations firm Biz 3 . The duo had pursued Columbia in particular because of its long @-@ standing history , as expressed by Bangalter : " It felt interesting conceptually to write this story with a record company like Columbia , with a 125 @-@ year legacy . " Furthermore , the vinyl labels of the album feature the classic yellow on red Columbia label used on records during said time period . 
 Central to the promotion was the limiting of exposure to the album 's content , as well as a focus on face @-@ to @-@ face contact for press previews . As Hahn stated , " There is a minimalism in our approach that creates an absence of information , and we notice our fans tend to throw themselves into the breach , or try to fill the empty spaces . " The album 's track titles were initially withheld from online retailers and later revealed through Columbia 's Vine account on 16 April 2013 as a video relaying a series of images . Following a reported leak of the song days earlier , " Get Lucky " was released as a digital download single on 19 April 2013 . On 13 May , Daft Punk 's official Vevo channel posted a video revealing the artwork packaging of the vinyl version of the album , as well as the first few seconds of the opening track . Later that day , a limited @-@ time preview stream of the full album was launched via the iTunes Store . 
 Daft Punk were scheduled to appear on 6 August episode of The Colbert Report to promote Random Access Memories , but were unable to do so because of conflicting obligations regarding the duo 's future appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards . According to Stephen Colbert , Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping . Colbert nevertheless broadcast an elaborate sketch of himself dancing to " Get Lucky " with various celebrities , including Hugh Laurie , Jeff Bridges , Jimmy Fallon , Bryan Cranston , Jon Stewart , Henry Kissinger , Matt Damon , and the Rockettes . 
 Columbia released a deluxe box set of Random Access Memories containing a 56 @-@ page hardcover book , the vinyl edition of the album , a partial 70mm film strip of the " Lose Yourself to Dance " video , and USB drives containing bonus audio as well as video content . 
 = = = The Collaborators = = = 
 The Random Access Memories official website features a video series called The Collaborators , directed by Ed Lachman and produced by The Creators Project , a partnership between Intel and Vice . Eight episodes were released in the series , which features interviews with participant artists that were involved in the making of the album . All featured album artists appear in the series with the exception of Casablancas , who would go on to appear prominently in the music video for " Instant Crush " . Excerpts of the lead single " Get Lucky " appear in the opening and ending of each Collaborators episode as well as excerpts of other songs from the album , corresponding to each featured musician . 
 The first episode features disco pioneer Moroder speaking about his experiences with the genre such as his records with Donna Summer and experimenting with synthesizers . Moroder also talks about his visit with Daft Punk in their recording studio . When asked how he first found out about the duo , he replied that he first heard their 2000 single " One More Time " and especially liked the breakdown middle section . He concluded that he views Daft Punk as " perfectionists " and described the album 's style as " something [ ... ] different . Still dance , still electronic ; but [ they ] give that human touch back " . 
 Episode two revealed that Edwards had contributed to the album ; he expressed that it was difficult keeping his involvement a secret . Edwards had previously collaborated with Daft Punk to create the song " Face to Face " on the 2001 album Discovery . He summarized his experience in the studio recording " Fragments of Time " as being life @-@ changing , as the sessions inspired him to move from New Jersey to California on a permanent basis . Edwards also pointed out the irony of " two androids [ ... ] bringing soul back to music " . 
 The third episode features Rodgers , who spoke of his background as a founding member of Chic , as well as his numerous collaborations with other artists throughout his career , such as David Bowie , Madonna , and Duran Duran . He expressed that working with Daft Punk " [ felt ] like [ ... ] working with contemporaries " and that they motivated each other to excel when collaborating on the album . At the end of the episode , Rodgers played a portion of a then @-@ unspecified song in which he participated , which was later identified as " Lose Yourself to Dance " , and remarked that the duo 's style has evolved whilst simultaneously exploring music 's past , suggesting that " they went back to go forward . " 
 Pharrell Williams participated in the fourth episode in which he elaborated on his experience with the creation of the album . Pharrell remarked upon the organic sound of the album , surmising that it " feels like the only click track they had was [ ... ] the human heartbeat " . He felt that the record can be enjoyed by people of all ages due to the accessible nature of music , and concluded that Daft Punk " could just get back on the spaceship that brought them here and go , and leave us . But they 're gracious , they 're nice robots . They chose to stay " . 
 Episode five features Noah Lennox , better known by his stage name Panda Bear , who spoke about his contribution to the album as well as his history with the band Animal Collective . He had first heard of Daft Punk through the music video of the song " Around the World " , which introduced him to many aspects of electronic dance music . He added that Homework was one of the few albums he and his older brother both enjoyed . Regarding Random Access Memories , Lennox remarked upon the approach of having live musicians , but structuring their performances in a minimal , sample @-@ like fashion . 
 For the sixth episode , Gonzales spoke about his contribution to the album . He recalled Daft Punk 's visible joy in listening to the raw session recordings made early in the production of the album , as well as the impending years @-@ long challenge that would be faced in completing the record . Gonzales expressed that the duo were aware of how the keys of each song would contribute to the emotional progression of the album as a whole . He therefore performed the piano in the song " Within " to accommodate the cycle . Gonzales concluded by pointing out that Daft Punk rarely collaborate with others , and thus felt that they did so on Random Access Memories to " make the work be transcendent " . 
 The seventh episode features Stéphane Quême , otherwise known as DJ Falcon , who spoke of first meeting Daft Punk when the duo began recording their debut album Homework . Quême noted that the group 's sound had changed since their debut , and that each of their albums had had a distinct influence . He also felt that the recording of Random Access Memories was such that a producer could potentially sample a track from it in the same way that Daft Punk themselves had sampled older records in their previous albums . Quême concluded that the duo were always sincere and although their first single was released 20 years ago , it still felt modern . 
 Episode eight features Paul Williams , who likened Daft Punk 's personas to a character from the film Phantom of the Paradise , in which he starred . He also added that their masks hide who they are from the public and allow the listeners to enjoy the music for what it is . Paul Williams worked with the duo at Henson Recording Studios , the former studio of A & M Records where he had worked previously , including his compositions for Jim Henson 's films featuring the Muppets , such as " Rainbow Connection " . He also stated that the song he penned was to be sung from the point of view of an unidentified first person , setting the emotion , but the lyrics came from the music itself . Paul Williams said that he felt vulnerable while writing the record , and said he writes best when he is allowed to be honest and vulnerable , a situation that Daft Punk allowed . He also stated that his sobriety added a sense of wonder to the song he wrote , as every day for him being sober has been wonderful compared to his prior life of excess .

 The 79th Annual Wee Waa Show , held on 17 May 2013 in the rural Australian town of Wee Waa , was selected as the venue for the worldwide album launch . The tickets for the Wee Waa album launch were completely sold within thirteen minutes of release , even though it was widely understood that Daft Punk would not be in attendance at the launch — the album launch details revealed that the album would be streamed live to the 4 @,@ 000 audience members . Australian police in the local Wee Waa area initiated Operation Hadrian to prevent alcohol @-@ related problems and anti @-@ social behaviour at the launch event . 
 Sony commissioned the design and construction of a custom @-@ built stage for the Wee Waa album launch event , and the Daft Arts production house assembled a LED circular music space that became Australia 's biggest @-@ ever outdoor dance floor . The record label described the creation , which was illuminated by a giant disco ball and complemented by four speaker towers and flood lights , as " Saturday Night Fever meets Close Encounters of the Third Kind " . The prelude to the streaming of the album was a pyrotechnic show provided by Father Anthony <unk> and his company " Holy Smoke " from <unk> , New South Wales .

 At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album gained an average score of 87 , based on 47 reviews , indicating " universal acclaim " and scoring higher than any other album by the duo . Q referred to it as " by some margin Daft Punk 's best album in a career that 's already redefined dance music at least twice . It is , in short , a mind blower . " The Independent stated , " Random Access Memories breathes life into the safe music that dominates today ’ s charts , with its sheer ambition … It 's an exciting journey , and one that , for all its musical twists and turns , has its feet planted on the dancefloor . " Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly called it " a headphones album in an age of radio singles ; a bravura live performance that stands out against pro forma knob @-@ twiddling ; a jazzy disco attack on the basic house beat ; a full collaboration at a time when the superstar DJ stands alone . " She concluded her review by saying that " if EDM is turning humans into robots , Daft Punk are working hard to make robot pop feel human again . " 
 Several critics commented on the variety of content on the album . NME said , " There 's a creeping notion that every musical idea that 's ever been so much as thought up is on this album . " In addition , Random Access Memories is ranked # 497 on NME 's list , " The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time " . Mark Richardson of Pitchfork Media echoed this sentiment , calling the record " a mix of disco , soft rock , and prog @-@ pop , along with some Broadway @-@ style pop bombast and even a few pinches of their squelching stadium @-@ dance aesthetic " . Richardson praised the engineering and recording on the album , but did say that " though everything about RAM , from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production , is meant to sound more ' human , ' the album at points sounds more sterile , almost too perfect . " Pitchfork deemed the album the seventh best of 2013 . DJ Magazine commented on the shift in Daft Punk 's musical style : " While Daft Punk clearly want to move on and evolve , ditching the electronic beats , house and techno that first elevated them to fame , it 's that music that forms the bedrock of their best tunes , and still , that 's what they 're best at making . " In a four @-@ star review , Resident Advisor stated that " it 's an album rooted in a now @-@ ancient aesthetic : ' 70s staples , like crisply recorded California studio music , or the kind of deceptively sophisticated New York disco that Nile Rogers [ sic ] , one of the album 's key guest artists , popularized with Chic . " In a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half star review , Heather Phares of AllMusic said that the record " taps into the wonder and excitement " of music from the 1970s and early 1980s . Phares concluded her review by saying , " Random Access Memories is also Daft Punk 's most personal work , and richly rewarding for listeners willing to spend time with it . " 
 Aaron Payne of musicOMH wrote , " Daft Punk somehow <unk> the wit and the light touch that 's pretty much their trademark . Instead , these long epics become somewhat tedious and there is a strong whiff of egoism and self @-@ indulgence . … At over 70 minutes , the album feels rather bloated . Quite a few of the songs are too long , or too empty of ideas , or too willing to repeat themselves , or too willing to play to type " . Dan Weiss of Paste noted that " none of the admittedly eclectic <unk> of Random Access Memories challenge or defy anything . They all evoke specific eras of film soundtrack or disco trend . The beats have grown less , not more , complex over time . "

 Peyton Williams Manning ( born March 24 , 1976 ) is a former American football quarterback who played 18 seasons in the National Football League ( NFL ) . Considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all @-@ time , he spent the majority of his career with Indianapolis Colts . In his last four seasons , he played with the Denver Broncos . Manning played college football for the University of Tennessee , leading the Tennessee Volunteers to the 1997 SEC Championship in his senior season . He is the second son of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and older brother of New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning . 
 Manning was selected by the Indianapolis Colts as the first overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft . From 1998 to 2010 , he improved the fortunes of the struggling Colts franchise and helped transform them into playoff contenders , leading the team to eight division championships , two AFC championships , and one Super Bowl , the franchise 's first since 1971 , as well as their first since relocating to Indianapolis . 
 After undergoing neck surgery that forced him to miss the entire 2011 season , Manning was released by the Colts and signed with the Denver Broncos . Serving as the Broncos ' starting quarterback from 2012 to 2015 , his tenure saw the Broncos reach the top of their division each year and his playing career concluded with a victory in Super Bowl 50 . 
 Manning holds many NFL records , including combined regular and postseason career wins ( 200 ) , AP MVP awards ( 5 ) , Pro Bowl appearances ( 14 ) , 4 @,@ 000 @-@ yard passing seasons ( 14 ) , passing yards ( 71 @,@ 940 ) , and touchdown passes ( 539 ) . A two @-@ time Super Bowl winner and the most valuable player of Super Bowl XLI , Manning is also the only quarterback to start the Super Bowl for two different franchises more than once each and the only starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl with two different franchises . 
 During a 2009 Monday Night Football game , Manning received the nickname " The Sheriff " from color commentator Jon Gruden due to his tendency to audible prior to the snap , and he was one of the most recognizable and parodied players in the NFL . Teams led by Manning typically utilized the hurry @-@ up offense in place of the standard huddle . 
 = = High school career = = 
 Manning attended Isidore Newman School in New Orleans , Louisiana , and led their football team to a 34 – 5 record during his three seasons as starter . He was named Gatorade Circle of Champions National Player @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Year and Columbus ( Ohio ) Touchdown Club National Offensive Player @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Year in 1993 . While at Newman he began wearing the number 18 in honor of his older brother Cooper , who was forced to give up football due to spinal stenosis . Younger brother Eli also wore the number when he became starting quarterback . Newman has since retired the number 18 jersey and it can be seen hanging in the school gym . Manning was among the most sought after high school players in the country and was recruited by about 60 colleges , led by Florida , Florida State , LSU , Michigan , Tennessee , Texas , Texas A & M , and his father 's alma mater , Ole Miss . 
 = = College career = = 
 Manning chose to play college football for the University of Tennessee Volunteers . Some were surprised that he did not pick the Ole Miss Rebels , for whom his father Archie played . He became Tennessee 's all @-@ time leading passer with 11 @,@ 201 yards and 89 touchdowns and won 39 of 45 games as a starter , breaking the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) record for career wins . 
 As a freshman , Manning began the season as the third @-@ string quarterback . In the season opener against UCLA , Manning was one of three quarterbacks to come off the bench after starter Jerry Colquitt suffered a season @-@ ending injury on the seventh play of the game . However , Manning wasn 't able to generate any offense and was pulled from the game . During the season 's fourth game , against Mississippi State , starter Todd Helton got injured and Manning took over . The Vols lost 24 – 21 , but Manning was named the team 's starter and remained so for the rest of his college career . In his first start , the following week against Washington State , the Vols won 10 – 9 . They won all but one of their remaining games , finishing the season 8 – 4 with a 45 – 23 victory over Virginia Tech in the Gator Bowl . 
 Manning and the Vols started off the 1995 season with victories over East Carolina and Georgia , before heading off to Gainesville to play the Gators . Against Florida , he threw for 326 yards and 2 touchdowns , leading the Vols to a 30 – 21 halftime lead . However , the Gators outscored the Vols 41 – 7 in the second half , winning 62 – 37 . This was the Vols ' only loss of the season , as they won their remaining 8 regular season games , including a 41 – 14 win over Alabama and then defeated Ohio State in the Citrus Bowl . The Vols ended the season ranked third and Manning came in sixth in Heisman Trophy voting . 
 The Vols opened the 1996 season ranked second behind Nebraska and one of the favorites to win the national championship . However , after winning their first 2 games against UNLV and UCLA , the Vols again lost to Florida 35 – 29 , with Manning throwing 4 interceptions . After winning their next four games , the Vols were upset by Memphis , despite Manning passing for 296 yards . 
 The Vols won the remainder of their games , including a 48 – 28 win in the Citrus Bowl over Northwestern , a game in which Manning passed for 408 yards and 4 touchdowns ; he was named the game 's MVP . 
 Manning completed his degree in three years , a Bachelor of Arts in speech communication , and was projected to be the top overall pick in the NFL Draft , but returned to Tennessee for his senior year . In his senior season , the Vols opened the season with victories against Texas Tech and UCLA , but for the third time in his career , Manning fell to Florida 33 – 20 . The Vols won the rest of their regular season games , finishing 10 – 1 , and advanced to the SEC Championship game against Auburn . Down 20 – 7 , Manning led the Vols to a 30 – 29 victory . Throwing for 4 touchdowns , he was named the game 's MVP , but injured himself in the process . The 3rd @-@ ranked Vols were matched @-@ up with second @-@ ranked Nebraska in the Orange Bowl ; if Tennessee won and top @-@ ranked Michigan lost to Washington State in the Rose Bowl , the Vols would win the national championship . However , the Vols ' defense could not stop Nebraska 's rushing attack , giving up over 400 rushing yards in a 42 – 17 loss . As a senior , Manning won numerous awards ; he was a consensus first @-@ team All @-@ American , the Maxwell Award winner , the Davey O 'Brien Award winner , the Johnny Unitas Award winner , and the Best College Player ESPY award winner , among others . In 2005 , Tennessee retired Manning 's number ( No. 16 ) . One of the streets leading to Neyland Stadium has been renamed Peyton Manning Pass . Manning also excelled academically and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1997 and awarded the National Football Foundation National Scholar @-@ Athlete Award . 
 In 1996 , while attending the University of Tennessee , Manning was accused by female trainer Jamie Ann Naughright of exposing his buttocks during a foot examination . Manning said that he was just pulling a prank by " mooning " another athlete in the room as Naughright bent over to examine him . Naughright settled with the university for $ 300 @,@ 000 for its alleged failure in four incidents , and resigned from the school . She had initially made a list of 33 complaints about the school .

 Manning was selected by the Indianapolis Colts with the first overall pick of the 1998 NFL draft . He would start as a rookie and go on to play for the Colts for 13 full seasons before being sidelined by a neck injury , which cost him the entire 2011 season . After recovering from the injury , he joined the Denver Broncos for whom he played from the 2012 season through the 2015 season . Excluding the year lost to injury , Manning played in 17 NFL seasons . 
 Manning is often referred to as one of the greatest passing quarterbacks of all time . He was named the NFL 's most valuable player a record five times ( four times as a Colt , once as a Bronco ) , was named to the Pro Bowl 14 times ( a record ) and named to the first team All @-@ Pro seven times . As a starter up to the end of 2015 season he had a career winning percentage of <unk> in the regular season . He holds the NFL record for career touchdown passes and career passing yards , achieved in 2014 and 2015 respectively . 
 The most commonly cited criticism of Peyton Manning 's professional career is that despite great success and gaudy statistics during the regular season , he did not enjoy similar levels of success in the post @-@ season . His career post @-@ season record as a starter was a more modest 14 @-@ 13 , compared to his regular season record through the 2015 season which was 186 @-@ 79 . Manning won two Super Bowls ( Super Bowl XLI and Super Bowl 50 ) and played in two others ( Super Bowl XLIV and Super Bowl XLVIII ) , being named MVP of XLI , while losing XLIV in an upset , and managing just one successful touchdown drive in each of XLVIII and 50 . During the early part of Manning 's career " his record @-@ breaking stats were written off because of the Colts ' postseason failures " ; conversely he posted poor stats in the 2015 regular season and Super Bowl 50 ( which would be his final season ) but nonetheless won his second league championship thanks to his team 's defense .

 Despite concerns about his arm strength and mobility , Manning was selected first overall in the 1998 draft by the Indianapolis Colts . Although many considered Ryan Leaf his rival for the first selection in the draft , and Leaf 's quarterback rating was higher , all six experts Sports Illustrated consulted believed that Manning was superior . Five said that they would take him first in the draft ; Sid Gillman said of Manning , " this is a pro quarterback " . The Colts ' scouts initially favored Leaf , but the team 's management and coaches were gradually won over by Manning 's attitude , particularly as Manning showed up prepared to a scheduled interview meeting with the Colts ' staff while Leaf arrived late . Colts general manager Bill Polian who had the final say on the draft selection recalled Manning saying " I 'll leave you with this thought . If you take me , I promise you we will win a championship . If you don 't , I promise I 'll come back and kick your ass . " 
 In his rookie season , he passed for 3 @,@ 739 yards with 26 touchdowns , set five different NFL rookie records including most touchdown passes in a season , and was named to the NFL All @-@ Rookie First Team . Manning 's first win came against fellow rookie Leaf , 17 – 12 over the Chargers . Weeks later , Manning faced off against Steve Young ; he threw three touchdowns , tying a Colts rookie record , but the 49ers kicked a late field goal to win 34 – 31 . In November against the Jets , Manning threw for three touchdowns in a 24 – 23 win ; he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this performance . It was the first game @-@ winning drive of Manning 's career , as he threw the game @-@ winning TD pass to Marcus Pollard . Manning was certainly a bright spot in 1998 for the Colts , but he also threw a league high 28 interceptions as the team struggled to a 3 – 13 record with a defense that gave up more than 27 points per game . The Colts lost many close games , including five games in which they had led by double @-@ digits at some point .

 The Indianapolis Colts opened the 1999 season with a 31 – 14 victory over Buffalo , but gave up a 28 – 7 lead the following week against the Patriots and lost . After defeating San Diego 27 – 19 in a game in which Manning threw for over 400 yards , and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week , they lost again , to Miami . The Colts responded by winning 11 of their remaining 12 games , finishing 13 – 3 and the AFC East champions . The 10 game turnaround from the previous year set an NFL record . As the second seed in the AFC , the Colts earned a first round bye , and faced Tennessee in the playoffs . The Colts lost 19 – 16 to the Super Bowl bound Titans and Manning was limited to one touchdown run . Manning finished the year with 4 @,@ 135 passing yards and 26 passing touchdowns , and was named both Second @-@ team All @-@ Pro and to the Pro Bowl , both firsts for him . In the Pro Bowl , he passed for 270 yards with 2 touchdowns . 
 The Colts started the 2000 season inconsistently . Following an opening week victory against Kansas City , they blew a 21 – 0 lead against the Raiders . The Colts responded with a Monday Night victory against Jacksonville , a 43 – 14 win in which Manning threw for 430 yards and 4 touchdowns ; Manning was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this performance . The Colts won 4 of their next 5 games , including one against New England in which Manning posted the first perfect passer rating of his career , but then lost 4 of the 5 games following that . The Colts regained their momentum , winning their final 3 games , including a 31 – 10 win over Minnesota on Week 17 . Manning threw for 4 touchdowns in the win and was again named AFC Offensive Player of the Week and the win gave the Colts a 10 – 6 record as well as a wild card spot in the playoffs . In the wild card game , the Colts fell to the Dolphins 23 – 17 in overtime . Manning passed for 194 yards and a touchdown in the loss . He finished the season with 4 @,@ 413 passing yards and 33 passing touchdowns and was named Second @-@ team All @-@ Pro and to the Pro Bowl . At the Pro Bowl , Manning threw two touchdown passes . 
 Manning and the Colts introduced their now @-@ signature no @-@ huddle offense , and used it to great effect in a Week 1 rout of the Jets , 45 – 24 . Two weeks later ( Week 2 games were not played as scheduled due to the 9 / 11 attacks ) the Colts advanced to 2 – 0 with a win over Buffalo , behind Manning 's 421 yards passing . He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game . However , the Colts lost the following week to New England , and continued their slide , losing their following two games . The Colts briefly rebounded , winning two games , but then lost 7 of their last 9 , including a 40 – 21 home loss to the 49ers . After Manning threw a career @-@ high four interceptions in that game , coach Jim Mora uttered his infamous " Playoffs ? Don 't talk about playoffs . Are you kidding me . Playoffs ? I 'm just hoping we can win a game , another game " press conference . Despite the 6 – 10 record , Manning finished the season with 4 @,@ 131 passing yards , 26 passing touchdowns , and 4 rushing touchdowns as the offense produced the second most points in the league . However , the defense allowed the most points and Jim Mora was fired after the season .

 Tony Dungy would become Manning 's second head coach in the NFL . The Colts started off the 2002 season 4 – 1 , before a 3 @-@ game losing streak sent them to 4 – 4 . The Colts responded by winning all but two of their remaining games , including a 35 – 13 upset of the Eagles in which Manning had a perfect passer rating for the second time in his career , giving them a 10 – 6 record and a spot in the playoffs . However , the Colts were pummeled by the Jets in the Wild Card game , 41 – 0 , with Manning passing for only 137 yards . He finished the year with 4 @,@ 200 passing yards and 27 passing touchdowns and was named to the Pro Bowl team . In the Pro Bowl , Manning completed five of eleven passes for 100 yards and a touchdown .
