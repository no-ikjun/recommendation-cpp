 He won the 100 m at the Commonwealth Games trials in a season 's best of 10 @.@ 03 s , then equalled Linford Christie 's record of 10 @.@ 04 s at European Cup , where he led the British team to victory as team captain . Victories over Maurice Greene followed at Oslo 's IAAF Golden League meeting and in Sheffield with a wind @-@ assisted 9 @.@ 95 s . He was the favourite for the 2002 Commonwealth Games , but Chambers faced stiff competition from British newcomer Mark Lewis @-@ Francis who was finishing fractions of a second behind him . Chambers won all his preliminary races and reached the final , along with Lewis @-@ Francis and Jason Gardener , but he suffered a cramp mid @-@ race and ended up in last place . He later revealed that he had feigned injury as the brief hamstring cramp was caused by drug abuse . The English sprinters had the three slowest times in the final , with Lewis @-@ Francis also beset by injury . 
 After Commonwealth disappointment on home turf , Chambers won gold medals in the 100 m and 4 × 100 m relay at the 2002 European Championships in Munich , setting a championship record of 9 @.@ 96 s . Chambers recorded a time of 9 @.@ 94 s at the Weltklasse Zürich meeting , again beating world record holder Greene . He finished the season by equalling Linford Christie 's European record at the 2002 IAAF Grand Prix Final . His run of 9 @.@ 87 s with a maximum allowable wind of + 2 @.@ 0 m / s left him second to Tim Montgomery , who set a world record of 9 @.@ 78 s . Chambers received the 2002 European Athlete of the Year Trophy for his achievements on the track that year . 
 = = = 2003 World championships = = = 
 Chambers began the 2003 season with a grandiose statement – namely that he would lower the 100 m record to 9 @.@ 65 s . After recovering from a minor injury he suffered in January , Despite claims he could also beat the 60 m indoor record , his form was poor and he failed to pass the heats at the 2003 British Grand Prix , finishing fourth in a time of 6 @.@ 68 s . He was beaten by Mark Lewis @-@ Francis by a hundredth of a second at the trials for the IAAF World Indoor Championships , narrowly missing out on selection with a time of 6 @.@ 59 s . 
 Chambers announced that he was to part with trainer Mike McFarlane in favour of a permanent relationship with Ukrainian coach Remi Korchemny . The sprinter started the 100 m season modestly , finishing third and fourth in Modesto and Eugene , respectively . Chambers beat Montgomery in Glasgow in June , running a stadium record of 10 @.@ 15 s into a headwind , and qualified for the World Championships by winning the AAA trials . 
 His season 's best came under unusual circumstances at the British Grand Prix – due to a system malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds , which was amended to 9 @.@ 96 s after video evidence was consulted . He could not match that form at the World 100 m final : Kim Collins , Darrel Brown , Darren Campbell , and Chambers all finished within a split second of each other and Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth . Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4 × 100 m relay , allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States team to beat him to the finish line . In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal , there was a sense of disappointment in the press that Chambers ' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised . 
 = = = Drug ban = = = 
 A sample for an out @-@ of @-@ competition drugs test that Chambers had provided in Germany on 1 August 2003 was re @-@ examined in October and subsequently tested positive for banned substances . The United States Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( USADA ) were investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co @-@ operative ( BALCO ) ; the workplace of both Chambers ' coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte . Both men faced charges of distributing illegal drugs to athletes in the United States . The BALCO Scandal uncovered drug use in a wide range of sportsmen and women , including sprinters Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery . 
 Chambers claimed that his new coach had introduced him to Conte as a way of providing him with specialised ' nutritional supplements ' - which he took by putting a few drops of liquid under his tongue . Conte had helped develop a type of anabolic steroid called THG , or <unk> , at BALCO . After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting . Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF compliant . 
 After further investigation , it was revealed on 22 October 2003 that Chambers had tested positive for the banned steroid THG . Analysis of his backup sample also tested positive and the outcome was confirmed on 7 November 2003 , making Chambers the first person to test positive for the new drug . Chambers was suspended the same day with an independent UK Athletics tribunal pending . The disciplinary hearing on 24 February 2004 resulted in a two @-@ year ban from athletics , backdated to begin on 7 November 2003 . He was also banned for life from the Olympics and stripped of the medals he had won since mid @-@ 2002 , after admitting that he had taken THG from that date . Chambers ' 2002 relay gold medal performance was erased , costing team @-@ mates Darren Campbell , Marlon Devonish and Christian Malcolm their medals in the process . Chambers was also ordered by the IAAF to pay back his earnings from the period of his athletics career that was affected by his drug abuse . 
 Conte claimed that rival coach Trevor Graham had revealed the drug to US testers , acting " purely out of competitive jealousy " as Chambers was challenging Graham 's trainees ; Montgomery and Greene . Chambers denied that he had any knowledge that the substance he was taking was banned and claimed he was deceived by Conte over its true use . However , he contradicted his statement in a later interview , saying that he had major suspicions that he was using banned substances but was too naïve and lacking in self @-@ respect to act otherwise . By Chambers ' own admission in 2008 , in a letter by his supplier Conte to British anti @-@ doping chief John Scott , THG was not the only substance he had used during his career . In his confession he admitted to the use of <unk> cream , EPO , HGH , insulin <unk> , modafinil and liothyronine . 
 Banned from competition , Chambers sought alternative commercial outlets for his athletic prowess . He had an unsuccessful American football try @-@ out with the San Francisco 49ers , hoping to emulate Renaldo Nehemiah . He drifted on to the celebrity circuit , appearing on British reality television series Hell 's Kitchen in May 2004 . However , Chambers had little interest in the show and soon chose to leave . He appeared in neither sporting events nor television programs for 18 months . 
 = = = Return to athletics = = = 
 Chambers began training in Jamaica in late 2005 in preparation for the athletics season . He faced new challengers in the 100 m as Maurice Greene was no longer a dominant force and Jamaican Asafa Powell was the new world record holder . Chambers began working with Glen Mills , coach of Caribbean sprinters Kim Collins and Usain Bolt . The drug suspension had expired in November but he needed to pass four mandatory drugs tests in order to gain clearance to compete with the IAAF . His comeback was further delayed as he gave an interview with the BBC revealing he began using drugs at the beginning of 2002 , not since August 2003 , as he had claimed to the IAAF . After further disclosure ( that took away his European 100 m gold medal and invalidated his European record of 9 @.@ 87 s ) , 
 Chambers was cleared to compete on 10 June 2006 , although his return was dependent on an agreement to repay prize money he won while using banned substances . He returned to competition on 11 June 2006 at the British Grand Prix and took third in 10 @.@ 07 s , behind Asafa Powell who equalled his own world record . Chambers stated that his training regime with Bolt had helped him make a strong opening performance despite a long absence from competition . The result placed Chambers at the top of the British rankings and was the second fastest time by a European sprinter in 2006 . 
 Chambers lamented the effects of his drug use and noted the irony that the drugs did not do much to improve the consistency of his performances . On his return to international competition his times were significantly worse than he achieved prior to drug use : in the 100 m final at the 2006 European Championships , Chambers ran a sub @-@ par 10 @.@ 24 s and finished in fifth place . He was part of the gold medal @-@ winning British 4 × 100 m team , but Darren Campbell , who was angry about losing his 2002 and 2003 relay medals due to Chambers ' ban , refused to join the team in a celebratory lap . After the competition , Chambers again expressed an interest in switching to American football and completed a week @-@ long NFL Europa training camp in Cologne that November . 
 = = = NFL Europa = = = 
 After attending a series of NFL Europa training camps , he gained a professional contract with German NFL Europa side Hamburg Sea Devils in March 2007 . Following news that Chambers was receiving new , legal nutritional supplements from Victor Conte , the Hamburg Sea Devils confirmed that Chambers would undergo a vigorous drug testing regime . 
 Chambers reflected on drug use in athletics in an interview with Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent for the BBC 's Inside Sport programme . Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using performance @-@ enhancing drugs because drug testers did not keep pace with advances in science and that athletes who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean . Chambers was roundly condemned for his comments in the interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world , including Sir Steve Redgrave , Mo Farah , and Sebastian Coe , although former 100 m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers ' claims . 
 Chambers ' American football career was brought to a standstill when a stress fracture injury on his right foot ruled him out for the season . The situation worsened further when the NFL closed the European league on 29 June 2007 leaving Chambers jobless . He returned as a TV personality on reality television show Cirque de <unk> in October but was unpopular with the public and subsequently voted off . 
 = = = Athletics again and rugby league = = = 
 Following the collapse of the NFL Europa franchise , Chambers made a second return to athletics in early 2008 . Competing in the 60 m indoor final at the Birmingham Games in February 2008 , he finished with a time of 6 @.@ 60 s , setting a new meeting record . UK Athletics chief executive Niels de Vos initially banned Chambers from competing in the trials for the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships but , after the IAAF overruled the decision , Chambers won the event and selection . UK Athletics stated that committee was " unanimous in its desire not to select Dwain " but were forced to by the selection criteria , saying they would have preferred to send younger athletes eligible for the Olympics . 
 At the World Indoor Championships 60 metres final , Chambers won a silver medal and recorded a new personal best of 6 @.@ 54 s to take second behind Olusoji Fasuba . The performance did not sway opinion : Chambers continued to encounter extensive criticism within athletics . Promoters did not invite him to key athletics events , Eddie <unk> – who had supported Chambers earlier in his career – refused to sponsor the sprinter , and the British Olympic Association ( BOA ) , prevented him from competing in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . To return to the track Chambers had to rely on the money he received from his partner , Leonie Daley , a civil servant whom he met at the Miss Jamaica UK competition . The couple now had a child , a boy named Skye who was born in September 2005 , and Chambers desperately needed to earn a living to support his family and pay off debts incurred through the drug ban . He amassed a selection of cuttings about his fall from grace and the BALCO Scandal in order to show his son the risks of drug abuse . 
 Chambers tried to fashion himself as a living example of the dangers of drugs , sporting a T @-@ shirt in Valencia with an anti @-@ drugs slogan of " Just Say No ! " . He also expressed regret about previous comments suggesting that drug use was necessary to reach the upper echelons of athletics and set about presenting himself as a changed , clean athlete – devoid of the bravado that had marked his earlier career . Chambers ' reinvention was met with a mixed reaction and the acceptance of a proven drug user on the track was not palatable to some . Dame Kelly Holmes and parts of the British press called for Chambers to retire from the Great Britain athletics team . 
 Chambers ' return to athletics took an unusual turn when he confirmed in March 2008 that he had joined English rugby league team Castleford Tigers on trial ; a move which surprised and angered in equal measure given the fact he had never played the sport before . The Rugby Football League did not object to the move , in spite of his drug @-@ damaged reputation , but stated much improvement was needed prior to any appearance for Castleford in the Super League competition . At a rugby press conference , Chambers expressed a desire to compete in the Beijing Olympics , casting doubt on his dedication to his new career . Chambers officially registered as a player with the Rugby Football League , and Martin <unk> declared that he was prepared to mentor Chambers . He completed training with the Castleford Tigers first @-@ team squad and made his debut in a reserve game against York City Knights , but Castleford announced that they would not be offering him a contract . 
 = = = High Court challenge = = = 
 In May 2008 Chambers announced that he was challenging his Olympic ban at the High Court of Justice . Chambers returned to sprinting in June and , in his first 100 m race since August 2006 , he won the <unk> meet with a time of 10 @.@ 26 s . He achieved the " A " Standard for the 2008 Beijing Olympics in June and won the British Olympic trials in ten seconds flat in July . Public opinion on an Olympic appearance remained split . 
 His performance at the Olympic trials was in vain as Mr. Justice Mackay upheld the BOA ban in the High Court of Justice and stated that a right to work was not sufficient reason to remove it . The BOA chairman , Lord Moynihan , was satisfied with the outcome , stating that those abusing drugs did not deserve to represent Great Britain at the Olympics . However , he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers ' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition . 
 The effort of the High Court challenge and the Olympic ban took its toll on Chambers , but he had no intention to retire and set an appearance in the 2012 London Olympics as his main goal , aiming to prove he could perform without the use of drugs . Lord Moynihan objected to this , saying it would sully the reputation of both the Great Britain athletics team and the London Olympics . In late 2008 Chambers signed a book deal , covering his athletics career and drug usage , and stated his desire to become a sprint coach when his track career was finished . He had his second child , a boy named Rocco , that November . 
 Charles van Commenee 's appointment as head coach of UK Athletics brought a change of approach towards Chambers as both the new coach and Niels De Vos welcomed him back to compete internationally . The pair judged that he had served his sentence – van Commenee was especially complimentary , stating : " He is a likeable guy and a damned fine athlete " . That month Chambers appeared at a " Tackling Doping in Sport " conference and told of the damage drugs had caused to his career , health , and finances . The Olympic ban remained in place , however , and London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe said : " I am clear cut on the Chambers case – I don 't think there is room for drugs cheats in sport " . 
 = = = Race Against Me = = = 
 Chambers ceased legal action to overturn his Olympic ban and instead aimed to finish his career on a high . He intensively studied the technique of Usain Bolt to improve his own times , seeing Bolt as the new generation 's Maurice Greene . Though he was still banned from <unk> @-@ organised events , he set a new personal best of 6 @.@ 52 s in the 60 m at the Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix , then became the UK Indoor Champion , equalling Mike Rodgers ' world leading time of 6 @.@ 51 s . At the 2009 European Indoor Championships he broke Ronald <unk> 's European 60 m record with a 6 @.@ 42 s run in the semi @-@ finals , then won the gold medal with a time of 6 @.@ 46 s in the final . British head coach van Commenee stated that Chambers had undergone vigorous testing and that his performance sent " a message that you can win and break European records in the proper way . " 
 The record @-@ breaking performance brought him an invite from the Berlin IAAF Golden League meet , although organising group <unk> condemned the move . Revelations in Chambers ' autobiography Race Against Me brought further controversy as the book had in @-@ depth accounts of his past drug abuse and claimed drug use remained rife in athletics , estimating that half the American Olympic athletes in Beijing had used illegal substances . Chambers signed a statement with UK Sport , verifying that he believed the information to be true , which brought a close to the organisation 's inquiries into his drug use . An IAAF investigation concluded that the book demanded no further action on their part . Olympic gold medallist and anti @-@ drugs campaigner Ed Moses gave his support , saying that Chambers admissions provided a useful insight , but that athletes and administrators remained in denial about the high levels of doping in athletics . 
 Invites to Golden League meets never materialised , but he continued to run at smaller events . He ran a European leading time of 10 @.@ 06 seconds at <unk> in Greece , and won the 100 m and 200 m races at the 2009 European Team Championships . He was the fastest entrant at the national championships but 2008 runner @-@ up Simeon Williamson won the final by some distance . The result took Chambers by surprise and he said that limited opportunities to race had made him complacent . He later withdrew from the 200 m race citing exhaustion . 
 At the World Championships Chambers finished sixth in 100 m final with a season 's best of 10 @.@ 00 seconds . He was the only sprinter from outside the Americas in the final and was some distance behind Bolt who ran a world record of 9 @.@ 58 seconds . However , he was very pleased with his performance and said he was happy just to be involved in the fastest 100 m race ever . He pulled out of the 200 m with a calf injury and called an end to his season . 
 = = = World indoor champion = = = 
 The following year he began by focusing on the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships , and he won the 60 m at the UK trials in 6 @.@ 50 seconds ( a time only he had bettered in the previous two seasons ) . His closest competitor , Ivory Williams , received a ban for marijuana usage , leaving Chambers as a strong favourite . He was the fastest in all rounds of World 60 m competition and surged ahead of Mike Rodgers in the final to win his first world title with a time of 6 @.@ 48 seconds . Banned from the 2010 Commonwealth Games , he set his sights on making the team for the 2010 European Athletics Championships . 
 At the start of the outdoor season he had wins in <unk> in Brazil and at the <unk> Or Memorial . He beat Christophe Lemaitre to win the 100 m at the 2010 European Team Championships , helping Great Britain to second place in the tournament and recording 9 @.@ 99 seconds – the first sub @-@ 10 time by a European athlete in almost four years . Lemaitre and Chambers were seen as the only gold medal contenders for the 100 m final at the European Athletics Championships , but the event defied expectations in terms of times and placings . The Frenchman won in 10 @.@ 11 seconds into a headwind while a tight finish between the four following athletes ( all 10 @.@ 18 ) saw Chambers finish fifth . 
 = = = 2011 – 2012 : World and Olympic semi @-@ finalist = = = 
 The start of his 2011 season saw him take a fourth consecutive national title over 60 m with a European @-@ leading time . At the 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships the following month he was beaten to the line by <unk> , although he was pleased with the silver medal as he had changed his training to focus towards the 100 m for that season . Four straight wins on the Brazilian Athletics Tour came at the beginning of his outdoor season in May , including a season 's best of 10 @.@ 01 seconds , and he took his fifth national title at the British trials . At the 2011 World Championships he reached the 100 m semi @-@ finals but fell foul of the IAAF 's new false start rule : he twitched in his blocks and was immediately disqualified . 
 He won his fifth national title in the 60 m in 2012 with a season 's best of 6 @.@ 58 m . A third consecutive podium finish came at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships , where he pipped Trell Kimmons to the bronze medal . Chambers was given the chance to return to the Olympic stage after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) decided in favour of the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency over the validity of British Olympic Association 's ( BOA ) Olympic ban by @-@ law . CAS agreed that the law was non @-@ compliant with the World Anti @-@ Doping Code , to which the BOA was signatory due to its connection with the International Olympic Committee . Chambers ran a 150 m @-@ straight best of 15 @.@ 27 seconds at the Great City Games in May then won the 100 m Olympic trial race , holding off emerging teenager Adam <unk> . His absence from the major track circuit came to an end with a run at the Diamond League London Grand Prix , although he did not achieve the Olympic " A " standard time there . 
 Chambers was named in the British squad for the 2012 London Olympics after the selectors took into account his trials win and his times from the previous year . Given the abrupt turnaround in his fortunes , he said : " For me representing my country in an Olympics is a privilege that should never be taken for granted . To be given the opportunity to do so in my home town has been a dream that at times has seemed very distant and is now a reality . " He returned to the British relay team at the 2012 European Athletics Championships after a six @-@ year absence but a botched baton change saw the team disqualified . At the Olympics he won his 100 metres heat in a season 's best of 10 @.@ 02 seconds , with a legal 2 @.@ 0 m / s following wind , in his first Olympic race in twelve years . He was drawn in the same semi @-@ final as Usain Bolt but Chambers ' run of 10 @.@ 05 seconds for fourth meant he did not make the final . His Olympics came to an end in the 4 × 100 metres relay heats as the British team made an illegal baton exchange . 
 = = = 2013 – present = = = 
 Chambers began his 2013 season with a 60 m win in Glasgow with a run of 6 @.@ 58 seconds . A back injury affected his preparations for the 2013 European Indoor Championships , where he was eliminated in the heats . Outdoors , he won his fourth consecutive British Championship title , running 10 @.@ 04 . A month later at the World Championships in Moscow , he ran 10 @.@ 14 in his heat to reach the semi @-@ finals , where he was eliminated running 10 @.@ 15 . 
 Chambers began 2014 by finishing second in the 60 m at the British Indoor Championships , before going on to finish sixth in the 60 m final at the World Indoor Championships in a time of <unk> This was the fastest time he had run the 60m in since 2010 . In his first three 100 m races of the outdoor season he failed to break 10 @.@ 20 , before hitting form during the British Championships . Going into the event , he was only ranked 10th in the UK , but he won the 100 m final , defeating <unk> <unk> , who had broken 10 seconds three weeks earlier . Chambers ' victory guaranteed him selection for the European Championships as his winning time was 10 @.@ 12 secs , inside the European qualifying mark of 10 @.@ 20 . This was his fifth consecutive win at the British Championships . 
 = = Statistics = = 
 Chambers ' performances at tournaments in the 100 metres event make him one of the fastest European sprinters in the history of recorded athletics . His personal best of 9 @.@ 97 s set at the 1999 Seville World Championships places him as the seventh fastest European in the 100 m and the fourth fastest Briton behind Linford Christie ( 9 @.@ 87 s ) , James <unk> ( 9 @.@ 91 s ) and <unk> <unk> ( 9 @.@ 96 s ) . Chambers ' annulled 9 @.@ 87 s finish at the Paris Grand Prix in 2002 would have made him the joint fastest British 100 m sprinter with Christie and the joint second fastest European in the event . 
 Amongst his British contemporaries Chambers ranks top with two 9 @.@ 97 s finishes ; the first in 1999 in Seville , Spain and the second in 2001 in Edmonton , Canada . Compatriot Mark Lewis Francis also scored a personal best of 9 @.@ 97 s at the Edmonton World Championships . Great Britain team @-@ mate Jason Gardener 's personal best of 9 @.@ 98 s falls just short of Chambers ' . None of his British contemporaries have broken the ten second barrier on more than one occasion ; Chambers has done so five times . 
 Chambers is the current European record holder in the 60 m with 6 @.@ 42 s and is the third fastest sprinter in the history of the event after Andre Cason and Maurice Greene . Chambers shares the British and European records for the 4 × 100 metres relay with Gardener , Darren Campbell and Marlon Devonish with their 37 @.@ 73 s finish at the 1999 Seville World Championships . It is also the fastest time recorded by a team outside of the IAAF 's North , Central American and Caribbean region .

 = Liliaceae = 
 The lily family , Liliaceae ( US English / <unk> / ) , consists of fifteen genera and about 705 known species ( <unk> & Byng 2016 ) of flowering plants within the order Liliales . They are monocotyledonous , perennial , herbaceous , often bulbous geophytes . Plants in this family have evolved with a fair amount of morphological diversity despite genetic similarity . Common characteristics include large flowers with parts arranged in threes : with six colored or patterned petaloid tepals ( undifferentiated petals and sepals ) arranged in two whorls , six stamens and a superior ovary . The leaves are linear in shape , with their veins usually arranged parallel to the edges , single and arranged alternating on the stem , or in a rosette at the base . Most species are grown from bulbs , although some have rhizomes . First described in 1789 , the lily family became a paraphyletic " catch @-@ all " group of petaloid monocots that did not fit into other families and included a great number of genera now included in other families and in some cases in other orders . Consequently , many sources and descriptions labelled " Liliaceae " deal with the broader sense of the family . 
 The family evolved approximately 52 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene eras . Liliaceae are widely distributed , mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and the flowers are insect pollinated . Many Liliaceae are important ornamental plants , widely grown for their attractive flowers and involved in a major floriculture of cut flowers and dry bulbs . Some species are poisonous if eaten and can have adverse health effects in humans and household pets . 
 A number of Liliaceae genera are popular cultivated plants in private and public spaces . Lilies and tulips in particular have had considerable symbolic and decorative value , and appear frequently in paintings and the decorative arts . They are also an economically important product . 
 = = Description = = 
 The diversity of characteristics complicates any description of the Liliaceae morphology , and confused taxonomic classification for centuries . The diversity is also of considerable evolutionary significance , as some members emerged from shaded areas and adapted to a more open environment ( see Evolution ) . 
 = = = General = = = 
 The Liliaceae family are characterised as monocotyledonous , perennial , herbaceous , bulbous ( or rhizomatous in the case of Medeoleae ) flowering plants with simple trichomes ( root hairs ) and contractile roots . The flowers may be arranged ( inflorescence ) along the stem , developing from the base , or as a single flower at the tip of the stem , or as a cluster of flowers . They contain both male ( <unk> ) and female ( <unk> ) characteristics and are symmetric radially , but sometimes as a mirror image . Most flowers are large and colourful , except for Medeoleae . Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups ( whorls ) of ' petals ' , that are often striped or multi @-@ coloured , and produce nectar at their bases . The stamens are usually in two groups of three ( trimerous ) and the pollen has a single groove ( monosulcate ) . The ovary is placed above the attachment of the other parts ( superior ) . There are three fused carpels ( <unk> ) with one to three chambers ( locules ) , a single style and a three @-@ lobed stigma . The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type . The fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule , but occasionally a berry ( Medeoleae ) which is dispersed by animals . The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges , arranged singly and alternating on the stem , but may form a rosette at the base of the stem . 
 = = = Specific = = = 
 Inflorescence 
 Usually indeterminate ( lacking terminal flower ) as a raceme ( Lilium ) ; sometimes reduced to a single terminal flower ( Tulipa ) . When <unk> ( multiple blooms ) , the flowers are arranged in a cluster or rarely are <unk> ( Gagea ) or a <unk> ( spike ) . 
 Flowers 
 <unk> , actinomorphic ( radially symmetric ) or slightly zygomorphic ( bilaterally symmetric ) , pedicellate ( on a short secondary stem ) , generally large and showy but may be inconspicuous : ( Medeoleae ) . <unk> may ( bracteate ) or may not ( <unk> ) be present . The perianth is undifferentiated ( perigonium ) and <unk> ( two whorled ) , formed from six tepals arranged into two separate whorls of three parts ( trimerous ) each , although Scoliopus has only three petals , free from the other parts , but overlapping . The tepals are usually petaloid ( <unk> ) with lines ( striate ) or marks in other colors or shades . The perianth is either <unk> ( all tepals equal , e.g. Fritillaria ) or <unk> ( two separate and different whorls , e.g. Calochortus ) and may be united into a tube . Nectar is produced in <unk> nectaries at the base of the tepals . 
 <unk> 
 Six stamens in two trimerous whorls , with free filaments , usually <unk> ( fused to tepals ) and <unk> ( outer whorl of stamens opposite outer tepals and the inner whorl opposite inner tepals ) , although Scoliopus has three stamens opposite the outer tepals . The attachment of the anthers to the filaments may be either peltate ( to the surface ) or pseudo @-@ basifixed ( surrounding the filament tip , but not adnate , that is not fused ) and <unk> longitudinally and are <unk> ( <unk> away from center ) . The pollen is usually monosulcate ( single groove ) , but may be <unk> ( lacking aperture : Clintonia , some Tulipa spp . ) or operculate ( lidded : Fritillaria , some Tulipa spp . ) , and reticulate ( net patterned : Erythronium , Fritillaria , Gagea , Lilium , Tulipa ) . 
 <unk> 
 Superior ovary ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( with fused carpels ) , with three <unk> ( fused ) carpels and is trilocular ( three locules , or chambers ) or unilocular ( single locule , as in Scoliopus and Medeola ) . There is a single style and a three lobed stigma or three stigmata more or less elongated along the style . There are numerous <unk> ( curved ) ovules which display axile placentation ( parietal in Scoliopus and Medeola ) , usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium . The embryo sac ( megagametophyte ) varies by genera , but is mainly <unk> ( e.g. Fritillaria ) . Embryo sacs in which three of the four megaspores fuse to form a triploid nucleus , are referred to as Fritillaria @-@ type , a characteristic shared by all the core Liliales . 
 Fruit 
 A capsule that is usually <unk> ( splitting along the locules ) as in the Lilioideae , but occasionally <unk> ( splitting between them , along the separating septa ) in the <unk> and wind dispersed , although the Medeoleae form berries ( <unk> ) . The seeds may be flat , oblong , angular , discoid , ellipsoid or globose ( spherical ) , or compressed with a well developed epidermis . The exterior may be smooth or roughened , with a wing or <unk> ( ridge ) , aril or one to two tails , rarely hairy , but may be dull or shiny and the lack of a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as <unk> that were previously included in this family , and striate ( parallel longitudinally ridged ) in the <unk> . The hilum ( scar ) is generally inconspicuous . The <unk> ( separate testa and tegmen ) seed coat itself may be thin , <unk> ( like cork ) , or <unk> ( hard or brittle ) . The endosperm is abundant , cartilaginous ( fleshy ) or horny and contains oils and <unk> but not starch ( non @-@ farinaceous ) . Its cells are polyploid ( triploid or <unk> , depending on the embryo sac type ) . The embryo is small ( usually less than one quarter of seed volume ) , axile ( radially sectioned ) , linear ( longer than broad ) or rarely rudimentary ( tiny relative to endosperm ) depending on placentation type , and straight , bent , curved or curled at the upper end . 
 Leaves 
 Simple , entire ( smooth and even ) , linear , oval to filiform ( thread @-@ like ) , mostly with parallel veins , but occasionally net @-@ veined . They are alternate ( single and alternating direction ) and spiral , but may be whorled ( three or more attached at one node , e.g. Lilium , Fritillaria ) , <unk> ( arranged along the aerial stem ) or sheathed in a basal rosette . They are rarely <unk> ( stem attached before apex ) , and lack stipules . The aerial stem is unbranched . 
 Genome 
 The Liliaceae include the species with the largest genome size within the angiosperms , Fritillaria <unk> ( 1C = 127 @.@ 4 pg ) , while Tricyrtis <unk> is as small as 4 @.@ 25 pg . Chromosome numbers vary by genus . Some genera like Calochortus ( x = 6 @-@ 10 ) , Prosartes ( 6 @,@ 8 @,@ 9 @,@ 11 ) , Scoliopus ( 7 @,@ 8 ) , <unk> ( 8 , 27 ) and Tricyrtis ( 12 @-@ 13 ) have a small and variable number of chromosomes while subfamily Lilioideae have a larger and more stable chromosome number ( 12 ) as have the Medeoleae ( 7 ) . 
 Phytochemistry 
 The seeds contain saponins but no calcium oxalate <unk> crystals , <unk> acid ( unlike Asparagales ) or cysteine derived sulphur compounds ( allyl sulphides ) , another distinguishing feature from the characteristic <unk> odour of the <unk> . Fritillaria in particular contains steroidal alkaloids of the <unk> and <unk> type . <unk> and <unk> alkaloids have been isolated from some Fritillaria species . Tulipa contains <unk> , an <unk> . ( see also : Toxicology ) 
 Characteristics often vary by habitat , between shade @-@ dwelling genera ( such as Prosartes , Tricyrtis , Cardiocrinum , Clintonia , Medeola , Prosartes , and Scoliopus ) and sun loving genera . Shade @-@ dwelling genera usually have broader leaves with smooth edges and net venation , and fleshy fruits ( berries ) with animal @-@ dispersed seeds , rhizomes , and small , inconspicuous flowers while genera native to sunny habitats usually have narrow , parallel @-@ veined leaves , capsular fruits with wind @-@ dispersed seeds , bulbs , and large , visually conspicuous flowers . ( See also Evolution ) . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The taxonomy of the Liliaceae has a very complex history . The family was first described in the eighteenth century , and over time many other genera were added until it became one of the largest of the <unk> families , and also extremely diverse . Modern taxonomic systems , such as the APG which is based on phylogenetic principles using molecular biology , have redistributed many of these genera resulting in the relatively small family that is currently recognised . Consequently , there are many different accounts of the Liliaceae in the literature and older uses of the term occur commonly . To distinguish between them , the Latin terms sensu lato and sensu stricto are frequently used ( together with their abbreviations , s.l. and s.s. ) to denote the broader or stricter sense of the circumscription respectively , e.g. Liliaceae <unk> .. 
 = = = History = = = 
 The Liliaceae family was described by Michel Adanson in 1763 and formally named by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 . Jussieu defined this grouping as having a calyx of six equal colored parts , six stamens , a superior ovary , single style , and a trilocular ( three @-@ chambered ) capsule . By 1845 , John Lindley , the first English <unk> unhappily acknowledged the great diversity in the circumscription of the family , and that it had expanded vastly , with many subdivisions . As he saw it , the Liliaceae were already paraphyletic ( " catch @-@ all " ) , being all Liliales not included in the other orders , but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better . He recognized 133 genera and 1200 species . By the time of the next major British classification – that of Bentham and Hooker in 1883 ( published in Latin ) – several of Lindley 's other families had already been absorbed into the Liliaceae . Over time the Liliaceae became increasingly broadly , and somewhat arbitrarily defined as all species of plants with six tepals and a superior ovary , eventually coming to encompass about 300 genera and 4 @,@ 500 species , within the order Liliales in the Cronquist system ( 1981 ) . Cronquist merged the Liliaceae with the Amaryllidaceae , making this one of the largest <unk> families . 
 Many other botanists echoed Lindley 's earlier concerns about the phylogeny of the Liliaceae , but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction . Dahlgren ( 1985 ) suggested there were in fact forty – not one – families distributed over three orders ( predominantly Liliales and Asparagales ) . In the context of a general review of the classification of angiosperms , the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny . Considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants , as elaborated by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group ( 1998 ) . 
 = = = Modern APG classification and phylogeny = = = 
 The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group ( APG ) made rapid progress in establishing a modern monophyletic classification of the flowering plants by 2009 . Despite establishing this relative degree of monophyly ( genetic homogeneity ) for the Liliaceae family , their morphology remains diverse and there exists within the Liliaceae clade or grouping , a number of subclades ( subgroups ) . Particularly enigmatic were Clintonia , Medeola , Scoliopus , and Tricyrtis . 
 Of the fifteen genera within the Liliaceae , the ten genera of the Lilioideae subfamily form one morphological group that is characterised by contractile bulbs and roots , and a Fritillaria @-@ type embryo @-@ sac ( megagametophyte with four megaspores ) . Within the Lilioideae , Clintonia and the closely related Medeola form a subclade , and are now considered a separate tribe ( Medeoleae ) . The other major grouping consists of the five genera constituting the Streptopoideae ( including Scoliopus ) and Calochortoideae ( including Tricyrtis ) subfamilies characterised by creeping rhizomes , styles which are divided at their apices , and by megagametophyte development of the Polygonum @-@ type ( a simple <unk> and triploid endosperm ) embryo @-@ sac . 
 = = = Evolution and biogeography = = = 
 The development of a phylogenetic approach to taxonomy suggested the Liliales formed some of the earliest monocots . Molecular analysis indicates that divergence amongst the Liliales probably occurred around 82 million years ago . The closest sister family to the Liliaceae are the <unk> with the Liliaceae separating 52 million years ago . Liliaceae thus arose during the late ( Maastrichtian ) Cretaceous to early ( Paleocene ) Paleogene periods . Major evolutionary clades include the Lilieae ( Lilium , Fritillaria , <unk> , Cardiocrinum , <unk> ) from the Himalayas about 12 mya and the <unk> ( Erythronium , Tulipa , Gagea ) from East Asia at about the same time . The Medeoleae ( Clintonia and Medeola ) may have appeared in North America but were subsequently dispersed , as may have the Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae . Liliaceae fossils have been dated to the Paleogene and Cretaceous eras in the Antarctic . 
 The Liliaceae probably arose as shade plants , with subsequent evolution to open areas including deciduous forest in the more open autumnal period , but then a return of some species ( e.g. Cardiocrinum ) . This was accompanied by a shift from rhizomes to bulbs , to more showy flowers , the production of capsular fruit and narrower parallel @-@ veined leaves . Again , some reversal to the broader reticulate @-@ veined leaves occurred ( e.g. Cardiocrinum ) 
 = = = Subdivisions and genera = = = 
 = = = = <unk> subdivisions = = = = 
 Due to the diversity of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae s.l. , many attempts have been made to form <unk> classifications , e.g. subfamilies and tribes . Classifications published since the use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae ( Liliaceae s.s. ) . The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website ( <unk> ) recognizes three subfamilies , one of which is divided into two tribes . 
 = = = = Genera = = = = 
 Various authorities ( e.g. ITIS 16 , <unk> 27 , WCSP , NCBI , <unk> ) differ on the exact number of genera included in Liliaceae s.s. , but generally there are about fifteen to sixteen genera , depending on whether or not Amana is included in Tulipa and Lloydia in Gagea . For instance Amana is still listed separately in WCSP . 
 Currently the <unk> lists fifteen genera , arranged as shown in this table : 
 The largest genera are Gagea ( 200 ) , Fritillaria ( 130 ) , Lilium ( 110 ) , and Tulipa ( 75 species ) , all within the Lilieae tribe . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The family is named after Lilium , the type genus , which is Latin for ‘ lily ’ and which in turn came from the Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Liliaceae are widely distributed , but mainly in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere . The centre of diversity is from southwest Asia to China . Their distribution is diverse , mainly in plains , steppes , and alpine meadows , but also in deciduous forests , Mediterranean scrub and arctic tundra . Tulipa and Gagea provide examples of ornamental <unk> <unk> types representing continental <unk> zones ( <unk> @-@ <unk> region ) , characterised by cessation of underground growth at high temperatures in early summer and requiring low winter temperatures for spring flowering . While some genera are shade @-@ dwelling , such as the Medeoleae , and Streptopoideae , Tricyrtis , and Cardiocrinum , others prefer a more open habitat . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The Liliaceae are ecologically diverse . Species of Liliaceae bloom at various times from spring to late summer . The colorful flowers produce large amounts of nectar and pollen that attract insects which pollinate them ( <unk> ) , particularly bees and wasps ( <unk> ) , butterflies ( <unk> ) and moths ( <unk> ) . The seeds are dispersed by wind and water . Some species ( e.g. Scoliopus , Erythronium and Gagea ) have seeds with an aril structure that are dispersed by ants ( myrmecochory ) . 
 = = = Pests and predators = = = 
 Liliaceae are subject to a wide variety of diseases and pests , including insects , such as thrips , aphids , beetles and flies . Also fungi , viruses and vertebrate animals such as mice and deer . An important horticultural and garden pest is the scarlet lily beetle ( Japanese red lily beetle , <unk> <unk> ) and other <unk> species which attack Fritillaria and Lilium . Lilium species may be food plants for the <unk> <unk> moth . A major pest of Tulips is the fungus , Botrytis <unk> . 
 Both Lilium and Tulipa are susceptible to a group of five viruses of the <unk> family , specifically the potyvirus ( named for Potato virus Y ) group , which includes the Tulip @-@ breaking Virus <unk> and the Lily streak virus ( Lily mottle virus , <unk> ) resulting in ' breaking ' of the color of the flowers . The viruses are transmitted by aphids . This breaking effect was of economic importance during the tulip mania of the seventeenth century , because it appeared to be producing new varieties . In modern times tulip breeders have produced varieties that mimic the effect of the virus , without being infected . One of these varieties is known as ' Rembrandt ' , after the Dutch artist of that name . Contemporary tulip owners commonly had Rembrandt and other artists paint their flowers to preserve them for posterity , hence the ' broken ' tulips were known as Rembrandt tulips at that time . Another modern variety is ' Princess Irene ' . One of the tulip breaking viruses is also named the Rembrandt tulip @-@ breaking virus ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Many species of Lilieae ( in genera Tulipa , Fritillaria , Lilium , and Erythronium ) and Calochortoideae ( Calochortus and Tricyrtis ) are grown as ornamental plants worldwide . Within these genera a wide range of cultivars have been developed by breeding and hybridisation . They are generally used in outdoor gardens and other displays , although in common with many bulbous flowering plants they are often induced to bloom indoors , particularly during the winter months . They also form a significant part of the cut flower market , in particular Tulipa and Lilium . 
 = = = = Tulips = = = = 
 Tulips have been cultivated since at least the tenth century in Persia . Tulip production has two main markets : cut flowers and bulb . The latter are used , in turn , to meet the demand for bulbs for parks , gardens and home use and , secondly , to provide the necessary bulbs for cut flower production . International trade in cut flowers has an approximate total value of 11 billion euros , which provides an indication of the economic importance of this activity . The main producer of tulip bulbs is the Netherlands , a country that accounts for 87 % of the global cultivated area , with approximately 12 @,@ 000 hectares . Other leading producers include Japan , France and Poland . Approximately ten other countries produce commercial tulips , largely for the domestic market . By contrast , the Netherlands is the leading international producer , to the extent of 4 billion bulbs per annum . Of these , 53 % are used for the cut flower market and the remainder for the dry bulb market . Of the cut flowers , 57 % are used for the domestic market in the Netherlands and the remainder exported . 
 Original Tulipa species can be obtained for ornamental purposes , such as Tulipa tarda and Tulipa <unk> . These are referred to as species , or botanical , tulips , and tend to be smaller plants but better at <unk> than the cultivated forms . Breeding programs have produced a wide range of tulip types , enabling blooming through a much longer season by creating early , mid- and late spring varieties . Fourteen distinct types are available in addition to botanical tulips , including Lily @-@ flowered , Fringed , <unk> and Rembrandt . In addition to blooming season , tulip varieties differ in shape , and height , and exhibit a wide range of colours , both pure and in combination . 
 = = = = Lilies = = = = 
 The largest area of production is also the Netherland , with 76 % of the global cultivated area , followed by France , Chile , Japan , the United States , New Zealand and Australia . Approximately ten countries produce lilies commercially altogether . About half of the commercial production is for cut flowers . Many of these countries export bulbs as well as supplying the domestic market . The Netherland produces about 2 @,@ 200 million lily bulbs annually , of which 96 % is used domestically and the remainder exported , principally within the European Union . One particularly important crop is the production of Lilium longiflorum , whose white flowers are associated with purity and Easter . 
 Although many Lilium species such as Lilium <unk> and Lilium candidum can be obtained commercially , the majority of commercially available lilies represent the products of a very diverse hybridisation program , which has resulted in a separate horticultural classification , including such groupings as Asian , Oriental and <unk> . In addition to a very wide variety of heights , lilies can be obtained in many colours and combinations of colours , and if properly selected can produce an extensive blooming season from early summer to autumn . Because of the history of Liliaceae , many species such as Watsonia ( bugle lily ) that were previously classified in this family bear the name ' lily ' but are neither part of the genus Lilium , or the Liliaceae family . 
 = = = = Other = = = = 
 A variety of Fritillaria species are used as early spring ornamental flowers . These vary from the large Fritillaria imperialis ( crown imperial ) available in a number of colours such as yellow or orange , to the relatively tiny species such as Fritillaria meleagris or Fritillaria <unk> @-@ vulpis with their chequered patterns . Erythronium is less common but a popular cultivar is ' Pagoda ' with its sulphur yellow flowers . Calochortus ( mariposa lily ) may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars .

Commercially , plants may be propagated in vitro and then planted out to grow into plants large enough to sell . 
 = = Toxicology = = 
 While members of the Liliaceae s.s. have been used as food sources in humans , the bulbs of some species are poisonous to household pets ( bulb toxicosis ) if eaten and may cause serious complications , such as renal failure in cats from Lilies , particularly Lilium longiflorum ( Easter Lily ) . Dogs may develop less serious effects such as gastrointestinal problems and central nervous system depression . Most Fritillaria ( e.g. Fritillaria imperialis , Fritillaria meleagris ) bulbs contain poisonous neurotoxic alkaloids such as <unk> ( <unk> ) , which may be deadly if ingested in quantity , while other species such as Fritillaria <unk> and Fritillaria affinis are edible . Tulips can cause skin irritation due to the presence of <unk> and <unk> , which are also found in the flowers , leaves and stems of Fritillaria . These are also toxic to a variety of animals . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Fritillaria extracts are used in traditional Chinese medicine under the name chuan bei mu , and in Latin , bulbus <unk> <unk> . The bulbs of Fritillaria <unk> have been used as <unk> and <unk> . Lilium bulbs , particularly Lanzhou lily ( Lilium <unk> ) are used as food in China and other parts of Asia . During World War II , starvation conditions in the Netherlands ( <unk> , hunger winter 1944 ) led to using Tulipa bulbs as food . Calochortus bulbs were eaten by Native Americans and by the Mormon settlers in Utah during starvation . Other members of the family used for food include Clintonia ( leaves ) , Medeola ( roots ) , Erythronium ( corms ) , and Fritillaria ( bulbs ) .

 = = = Lilies = = = 
 The type genus , Lily ( Lilium ) , has a long history in literature and art , and a tradition of symbolism as well as becoming a popular female name , and a floral emblem , particularly of France ( fleur @-@ de @-@ lis ) . The cultivation of lilies has been described since at least the ninth century , when Charlemagne ordered it to be grown at his imperial palaces . However , the name ' lily ' has historically been applied to a wide variety of plants other than the Lilium genus . 
 The lily appears in ancient literature associated with both sovereignty and virginal innocence , and is mentioned on a number of occasions in the Bible , such as the description in Solomon 's Song of Songs ( 2 , 1 – 2 ) " I am a rose of Sharon , a lily of the valleys . Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the young women " or the Gospel of Mathew ( 6 , 28 ) " Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin " to represent beauty . Artistic representations can be found as far back as frescos from the second century BC , at <unk> and Knossos . Early Christian churches , such as that of the Basilica of Sant ' <unk> in Classe were sometimes decorated with lilies . While predominantly depicted as white , those seen at Akrotiri are red lilies . The white lily has long been seen as a symbol of purity , coming to be associated with the Virgin Mary in the Middle Ages , from which came the name ‘ Madonna lily ’ ( Lilium candidum ) . A well @-@ known example is Leonardo da Vinci 's Annunciation ( 1472 – 1475 ) in which the archangel Gabriel bears a Madonna lily . Other symbolic meanings include glory , love and birth . 
 = = = = Fleur @-@ de @-@ lis = = = = 
 The stylised lily , or fleur @-@ de @-@ lis ( lily flower ) has long been associated with royalty , although it may originally have been derived from the form of an iris . It has also been associated with the head of a spear . Its three parts have been associated with the three classes of mediaeval society , or alternatively faith , wisdom and chivalry . Whatever its exact derivation , it has come to be associated with France and the French monarchy since the earliest Frankish kings . Consequently , it became incorporated into not only French heraldry but also that of many heraldic devices in jurisdictions where there had been historic French influence , such as Quebec and New Orleans . In modern times it appears in many forms , symbolic and decorative , and can be used on compasses to indicate the direction north , as well as the Scouting movement . 
 = = = Tulips = = = 
 Tulips ( Tulipa ) also have a long cultural tradition , particularly in the Islamic world . The Persian word for tulips , <unk> ( <unk> ) , was borrowed into Turkish and Arabic as <unk> . In Arabic letters , <unk> is written with the same letters as Allah , and is used to denote God symbolically . Tulips became widely used in decorative motifs on tiles , fabrics , and ceramics in Islamic art and the Ottoman Empire in particular , and were revered in poetry , such as that of Omar <unk> in the twelfth century . 
 Tulips were an essential part of the gardens of Persia , having been cultivated from the Steppes . As the Seljuks – Oghuz @-@ Turkic leaders originated from the steppes – moved to Persia , and then west , they took tulips with them to Turkey , where many escaped cultivation and became naturalised . Today there are a number of places in Turkey called <unk> ( ‘ with tulips ’ ) . Tulips first appeared in the decorative arts in Turkey in the thirteenth century and flourished under the Ottomans , in particular in the royal palaces , and was adopted by the <unk> as their symbol . Further species were collected from Persia and the spreading Ottoman Empire saw to it that tulip culture also spread . By the sixteenth century it was a national symbol , hence the designation " Tulip era " , by which time they were becoming of economic importance . 
 By 1562 the tulip trade had reached Europe with the first shipment to Antwerp , where they were mistaken for vegetables , although they had been cultivated in Portugal since 1530 , and first appeared in illustration in 1559 , and the first tulip flowers were seen in the Netherlands in 1625 . Tulips spread rapidly across Europe in the seventeenth century , and became an important trading item , initially in France before concentrating in the Netherlands . Eventually speculative trading in tulips became so intense as to cause a financial bubble which eventually collapsed , a period known as tulip mania ( tulipomania ) , from 1634 to 1637 , similar to the Ottoman Empire 's Tulip era . 
 Nevertheless , since then the tulip has become indelibly associated with the Netherlands and all things <unk> it was during this period that the <unk> , a ceramic vase for growing tulips indoors was devised , and the Golden Age of Dutch Painting was replete with images of tulips . Although tulip festivals are held around the world in the spring , the most famous of these is the display at <unk> . One of the better @-@ known novels on tulips is The Black Tulip by Alexandre Dumas , père in 1850 , dealing with a contest to grow a black tulip in late seventeenth @-@ century Haarlem .

 Fritillaria are also often used as floral emblems , for instance as the county flower of Oxfordshire , UK . Calochortus nuttallii , the <unk> lily , is the official state flower of Utah . 
 = M @-@ 77 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 77 is a state trunkline highway in the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan . It starts in US 2 near Blaney Park north of Lake Michigan . The highway borders the eastern edge of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge and passes through the community of Germfask . At Seney , it overlaps M @-@ 28 to cross the Fox River before returning northward . The northern half has been designated as a Scenic Spur of the Lake Superior Circle Tour . M @-@ 77 runs along the eastern end of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and terminates in Grand Marais north of H @-@ 58 near Lake Superior . Originally designated by 1919 , the highway has not been changed much in its history . By the late 1950s , the highway was paved , completing the modern M @-@ 77 highway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 From US 2 near Blaney Park going north , M @-@ 77 runs past the former Blaney Park Resort and out of town by a small private airport next to Lake Ann Louise . The highway continues through rural woodlands past Chip Lake . The road crosses the Manistique River as it runs through Germfask . From just south of Germfask to just south of Seney , the road forms the eastern boundary of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge . 
 The refuge is a managed wetland in Schoolcraft County in Michigan . Established in 1935 , it has an area of 95 @,@ 212 acres ( 38 @,@ 531 ha ) bordered by M @-@ 28 and M @-@ 77 that is the remains of the Great Manistique Swamp , a perched sand wetland located in the central UP . The refuge contains the <unk> Bog National Natural Landmark within its boundaries . During the 1930s , work crews employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) rebuilt , restored , and expanded the wetland drains , this time for active wetlands management purposes . These CCC ponds and drains are still used by the wetlands managers that staff the current National Wildlife Refuge . 
 At Seney , M @-@ 77 crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway and turns east along M @-@ 28 . Both run concurrently for less than half a mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) over a crossing of the Fox River before M @-@ 77 turns back northward . About 11 miles ( 18 km ) north of Seney , the road turns sharply to the west , near Snyder Lake . The trunkline continues along several other lakes before turning northeasterly and then northward . The road marks the easternmost extent of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore around 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) south of Grand Marais . Within Grand Marais , the highway follows Lake Avenue through downtown . M @-@ 77 intersects H @-@ 58 in town and the two designations run concurrently for two blocks . The trunkline continues one block farther north and ends at an intersection with <unk> Street by the Grand Marais harbor ; the roadway continues northward as Lake Avenue at that point . 
 Grand Marais is situated on the shores of Lake Superior some 25 miles ( 40 km ) north of the mainline of the Lake Superior Circle Tour . Since the Tour runs only along state trunklines in Michigan , a Scenic Spur of the tour was created to route traffic north from Seney to Grand Marais . The scenic spur also terminates in Grand Marais with M @-@ 77 north of the junction with H @-@ 58 . 
 M @-@ 77 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2009 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 77 were the 1 @,@ 924 vehicles daily between <unk> and Ten Curves roads in Schoolcraft county ; the lowest counts were the 799 vehicles per day north of M @-@ 28 in Seney . No section of M @-@ 77 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 Liz Lemon ( Tina Fey ) is dateless for ex @-@ boyfriend Floyd DeBarber 's ( Jason Sudeikis ) wedding , and does not want to be alone . She revisits her old boyfriends — Drew Baird ( Jon Hamm ) and Dennis Duffy ( Dean Winters ) — but the visits do not go well . Later , at a party , Liz learns from Cerie Xerox ( Katrina Bowden ) , her office assistant , that she will be seated next to Wesley Snipes ( Michael Sheen ) — a man whom Liz despises — at Cerie 's wedding . As a result of this , Liz invites Wesley as her date to Floyd 's wedding . At the wedding , Wesley reveals that he has lost his job , and needs Liz to get him U.S. residency , and proposes marriage to her . After an unsuccessful conversation with Mike ( John Anderson ) , a friend of Floyd 's , Liz agrees to marry Wesley . 
 Meanwhile , Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) is still in a dilemma in who to choose from between CNBC host Avery Jessup ( Elizabeth Banks ) and his high school sweetheart Nancy Donovan ( Julianne Moore ) . Avery decides not to be Jack 's date to Cerie 's wedding , and that while she is gone , Jack should think about whether or not he wants to be with her . As soon as Avery leaves , Nancy shows up at the 30 Rock building unannounced , and decides to spend the weekend with Jack . Liz tries to talk him out of going on a date with Nancy , after he asked her for advice . He decides to keep things platonic with Nancy , so that no problem ensues in his decision to choose between them , but Jack ends up sleeping with Nancy . The next morning , Nancy admits that the two spending the night together was a big deal , as Jack was the first man she slept with after her divorce . At Floyd 's wedding , Jack tells Nancy about Avery , and as a result , Nancy threatens to leave him forever once the ceremony is over . While Liz gives a reading , Jack texts her to stall , resulting in Liz reading inappropriate scripture recitations at the wedding . 
 Finally , Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) informs " Dot Com " Slattery ( Kevin Brown ) and NBC page Kenneth Parcell ( Jack McBrayer ) that he wishes to be part of the film Garfield 3 : Feline Groovy .

 = Bill Ponsford = 
 William Harold " Bill " Ponsford MBE ( 19 October 1900 – 6 April 1991 ) was an Australian cricketer . Usually playing as an opening batsman , he formed a successful and long @-@ lived partnership opening the batting for Victoria and Australia with Bill Woodfull , his friend and state and national captain . Ponsford is the only player to twice break the world record for the highest individual score in first @-@ class cricket ; Ponsford and Brian Lara are the only cricketers to twice score 400 runs in an innings . Ponsford holds the Australian record for a partnership in Test cricket , set in 1934 in combination with Donald Bradman — the man who broke many of Ponsford 's other individual records . 
 Despite being heavily built , Ponsford was quick on his feet and renowned as one of the finest ever players of spin bowling . His bat , much heavier than the norm and nicknamed " Big Bertha " , allowed him to drive powerfully and he possessed a strong cut shot . However , critics questioned his ability against fast bowling , and the hostile short @-@ pitched English bowling in the Bodyline series of 1932 – 33 was a contributing factor in his early retirement from cricket a year and a half later . Ponsford also represented his state and country in baseball , and credited the sport with improving his cricketing skills . 
 Ponsford was a shy and taciturn man . After retiring from cricket , he went to some lengths to avoid interaction with the public . He spent over three decades working for the Melbourne Cricket Club , where he had some responsibility for the operations of the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) , the scene of many of his great performances with the bat . In 1981 the Western Stand at the MCG was renamed the WH Ponsford Stand in his honour . This stand was demolished in 2003 as part of the redevelopment of the ground for the 2006 Commonwealth Games , but its replacement was also named the WH Ponsford Stand . At the completion of the stadium redevelopment in 2005 , a statue of Ponsford was installed outside the pavilion gates . In recognition of his contributions as a player , Ponsford was one of the ten initial inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early life = = 
 The son of William and Elizabeth ( née Best ) Ponsford , Bill Ponsford was born in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy North on 19 October 1900 . His father was a postman whose family had emigrated from Devon to Bendigo , Victoria , to work in the mines during the 1850s gold rush . His mother was also born in the goldfields , at Guildford , before moving to Melbourne with her father , a Crown Lands bailiff . Ponsford grew up on Newry St in Fitzroy North , and attended the nearby Alfred Crescent School , which stood beside the Edinburgh Gardens . 
 Ponsford learnt the rudiments of cricket from his uncle Cuthbert Best — a former club player for Fitzroy . He had the best batting and bowling averages for his school team in 1913 , 1914 and 1915 and eventually rose to the captaincy . His local grade club , Fitzroy , awarded Ponsford a medallion — presented by the local mayor — for being his school 's outstanding cricketer in the 1913 – 14 and 1914 – 15 seasons . The medallion was awarded along with an honorary membership of the club , and Ponsford trained enthusiastically , running from school to the nearby Brunswick Street Oval in the Edinburgh Gardens to practise in the nets . Les Cody , the general secretary of Fitzroy Cricket Club and a first @-@ class cricketer with New South Wales and Victoria , was Ponsford 's first cricketing role model . 
 In December 1914 , Ponsford completed his schooling and earned a qualifying certificate , which allowed him to continue his education at a high school should he wish . He instead chose to attend a private training college , Hassett 's , to study for the Bank Clerk 's exam . Ponsford passed the exam and commenced employment with the State Savings Bank at the Elizabeth Street head office in early 1916 . In May 1916 , the Ponsford family moved to <unk> Rd in Elsternwick , a wealthier part of Melbourne . Ponsford played with Fitzroy in a minor league for the remainder of the 1915 – 16 season , but under the geographical " zoning " rules in place for club cricket , he was required to transfer to St Kilda Cricket Club in the following season .

 = = = Early record breaking = = = 
 The First World War and the creation of the First Australian Imperial Force led to a significant shortage of players available for cricket . As a result , Ponsford was called up to make his first @-@ grade debut for St Kilda during the 1916 – 17 season , just one week before his sixteenth birthday . This match was against his old club Fitzroy , and was played at the familiar Brunswick Street Oval . The young Ponsford 's shot @-@ making lacked power , and after making twelve singles , he was bowled . He played ten matches in his first season with the St Kilda First XI and averaged 9 @.@ 30 runs per innings . By the 1918 – 19 season , Ponsford topped the club batting averages with an average of 33 . He also topped the bowling averages , taking 10 wickets at an average of 16 @.@ 50 runs per wicket with his leg spin . 
 Despite failing to score a century for his club side ( something he did not rectify until the 1923 – 24 season ) , Ponsford was called up to represent Victoria against the visiting England team in February 1921 — his first @-@ class cricket debut . His selection was controversial ; the leading personality in Victorian cricket and national captain , " The Big Ship " Warwick Armstrong , had been dropped . Armstrong 's omission sparked a series of angry public meetings protesting against the perceived persecution of Armstrong by administrators . While making his way to the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) for the match , Ponsford had to walk through demonstrators carrying placards that denounced his selection at the expense of Armstrong . Without Armstrong , the Victorians were comfortably beaten by Johnny Douglas 's English team by seven wickets . Batting down the order , Ponsford made six in the first innings and 19 in the second innings . Later that month , Ponsford made his maiden first @-@ class century , scoring 162 against Tasmania at the NTCA Ground in Launceston , despite batting low in the order , at number eight . 
 Ponsford was named captain of a Victorian side made of up of promising youngsters , to play against Tasmania at the MCG on 2 – 5 February 1923 . In this , only his third first @-@ class match , Ponsford broke the world record for the highest individual innings score at that level on the final day of the match , scoring 429 runs and batting for nearly eight hours . Along the way , he broke Armstrong 's record for the highest score for Victoria ( 250 ) , before surpassing former England captain Archie MacLaren 's world record individual score of 424 . The team score of 1 @,@ 059 was also a new record for a first @-@ class innings — an impromptu paint job was needed to show the score on a board that was not designed to display a four @-@ figure total . 
 The Governor General of Australia , Lord Forster , visited the dressing rooms after the day 's play to congratulate Ponsford personally . Cables from around the world applauded the new record @-@ holder , including one from Frank Woolley , whose 305 * was the previous highest score against Tasmania . The former world record holder MacLaren was not so forthcoming . MacLaren thought that the two teams were both short of first @-@ class standard and therefore the record should not be recognised . However , an agreement made in 1908 confirmed that matches against Tasmania should be categorised as first @-@ class matches . An exchange of letters between MacLaren and the Victorian Cricket Association , and speculation over possible political motives followed in the popular press , but the famous Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack recognised and published Ponsford 's score as the record . 
 Selected for his first Sheffield Shield match , against South Australia three weeks after his record breaking innings , Ponsford — still batting down the order , at number five — made 108 . The South Australian ( and former Australian ) captain Clem Hill watched Ponsford bat and commented , " [ Ponsford ] is young and full of promise ; in fact , since Jim Mackay , the brilliant New South Welshman , I think he is the best . " In 1923 – 24 Ponsford continued to score at a heavy rate . Against Queensland in December , he made 248 and shared in a partnership of 456 runs with Edgar Mayne — the highest first wicket partnership by an Australian pair to this day . Later that season , he scored a pair of centuries against arch @-@ rivals New South Wales , accumulating 110 in each innings . 
 = = = Test debut and more records = = = 
 Ponsford broke into international cricket in the 1924 – 25 season . After scoring 166 for Victoria against South Australia , and 81 for an Australian XI against the touring English team , he was selected for the first Test against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground ( SCG ) . Batting at number three , Ponsford joined his captain Herbie Collins at the wicket after the dismissal of opening batsman Warren Bardsley . Although Ponsford initially struggled against the " baffling " swing bowling of Maurice Tate , the experienced Collins was confident enough to farm the strike during Tate 's initial spell and Ponsford went on to make a century ( 110 ) on his Test debut . Ponsford later said " I was most grateful for Herbie taking [ Tate 's bowling ] until I was settled in . I doubt I would have scored a century but for his selfless approach . " He scored 128 in the second Test at Melbourne ; thereby becoming the first batsman to score centuries in his first two Tests . Ponsford played in all five Tests of the series , scoring 468 runs at an average of 46 @.@ 80 . 
 There were no international visitors to Australia in the 1925 – 26 season , so Ponsford was able to play a full season for Victoria . He scored 701 runs at an average of 63 @.@ 72 , including three centuries , making him the fourth highest runscorer for the season . At the end of the season , Ponsford was chosen for the Australian team to tour England in 1926 . He was one of the younger players in the squad ; 9 of the 15 players were over the age of 36 . He made a good start to the tour , scoring a century ( 110 * ) in his first innings at Lord 's against the Marylebone Cricket Club in May . Unfortunately for Ponsford , tonsillitis caused him to miss three weeks of cricket in June and he was not chosen for the first three Tests of the English summer . He returned for the fourth and fifth Tests . The fifth Test was the only match that saw a result — an English victory — which meant that the hosts won the series and the Ashes one Test to nil . For the tour , Ponsford made 901 runs at an average of 40 @.@ 95 , including three centuries . Wisden described Ponsford 's performances for the season as " something of a disappointment " but noted that " he batted well enough on occasion to demonstrate his undoubted abilities " . 
 In the season following his return to Australia , Ponsford continued to make large scores . He started the season by hitting 214 runs ( out of a Victoria team total of 315 ) against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval and followed this with 151 at the MCG against Queensland . In his next match , against New South Wales , Ponsford again rewrote the record books . Ponsford scored 352 runs , 334 of them in a single day , and helped Victoria to an innings total of 1 @,@ 107 , which remains the highest team total in first @-@ class cricket , breaking Victoria 's own record set four years earlier . After Ponsford played the ball back on to his stumps to be dismissed bowled , he then turned to look at his broken wicket and famously said , " <unk> , I am unlucky . " For the season , Ponsford went on to score 1 @,@ 229 runs at an average of 122 @.@ 90 , including six centuries and two half @-@ centuries from only ten innings . 
 In the 1927 – 28 season , Ponsford continued where he had left off at the end of the previous summer . Ponsford topped the aggregate and the averages for the season , scoring 1 @,@ 217 runs at an average of 152 @.@ 12 . In December 1927 , he improved on his own first @-@ class world record score , hitting 437 against Queensland ; later that month he scored 202 and 38 against New South Wales and he then added another 336 against South Australia over the New Year . He had scored 1 @,@ 013 runs in the space of four innings . This feat was part of a sequence in which he scored a century in a record ten consecutive first @-@ class matches from December 1926 to December 1927 . In January 1928 the Daily News in London described Ponsford as " the most remarkable and the most heart @-@ breaking scoring @-@ machine ever invented " . Ponsford toured New Zealand with an Australian squad in 1928 . In the six first @-@ class matches scheduled , he scored 452 at an average of 56 @.@ 50 , second only to his opening partner Bill Woodfull in both average and aggregate . In the 1929 – 30 domestic season , Ponsford scored 729 runs at an average of 45 @.@ 56 , including three centuries , to finish fourth in the season aggregates . 
 = = = Struggles and success = = = 
 A strong England team — captained by Percy Chapman and including Jack Hobbs , Herbert Sutcliffe , Wally Hammond and Harold Larwood — toured Australia in 1928 – 29 . Ponsford 's form was good in the lead up to the Tests ; he scored 60 not out for Victoria against the tourists , and added 275 * against South Australia . Before the Test series started , Ponsford had declared in a column in the Herald that Harold Larwood 's " pace through the air is not all that fast for a fast bowler " , with the qualification that " he makes great pace off the pitch " . Larwood dismissed him for scores of two and six in the first Test , and fractured a bone in Ponsford 's hand in the second . The injury sidelined Ponsford for the remainder of the Test series . 
 Ponsford travelled to England for a second time , with the 1930 Australian team . In a wet summer , Australia won the series two Tests to one , recovering The Ashes . For the second time in as many trips to England , Ponsford fell ill — gastritis caused him to miss the third Test at Headingley Stadium . Despite this setback , Ponsford scored 330 runs in the Tests at an average of 55 @.@ 00 . Wisden wrote , " Ponsford had a much better season — especially in the Test matches — than four years previously . ... In helping his captain to wear down England 's bowling he accomplished great work and , even if he was seldom really attractive to watch , there could be no question about his skill and how difficult he was to get out . " The outstanding performer of the tour was the young Don Bradman , who scored 974 runs in the Test matches — this remains a world record for the most runs scored in a Test series . Ponsford played a part in Bradman 's success ; Wisden stated that " it is only fair to say that on more than one occasion [ Bradman 's ] task was rendered the easier by the skilful manner in which Woodfull and Ponsford , by batting of different description , had taken the sting out of the England bowling . " 
 In 1930 – 31 , the West Indies sent their first @-@ ever touring team to Australia for a five Test series . Ponsford was paired with a new partner , Archie Jackson ; Woodfull chose to bat down the order to allow the young New South Welshman to open the batting . The change had little effect on Ponsford , who scored 467 runs at an average of 77 @.@ 83 against the Caribbean tourists . Ponsford and Jackson started the Test series well , their 172 run partnership in the second innings taking Australia to a 10 @-@ wicket victory in the first Test . Ponsford finished just short of his century , unbeaten on 92 . Before walking out to bat , Jackson had said to Ponsford , " I see the skipper padded up . We won 't give him a hit ! " Jackson failed in the second Test at the SCG , but Ponsford went on to score his highest Test score to date , 183 , before being bowled by Tommy Scott . Another century ( 109 ) in the third Test was part of a 229 run partnership with Bradman , who went on to score 223 . Ponsford was reunited with Woodfull as his opening partner for the remaining Tests after Jackson , ill and struggling for form , was omitted . The West Indies had a famous victory in the fifth Test , but lost the series 4 – 1 . 
 Ponsford had less success against the South Africans during their tour of Australia in 1931 – 32 . While the Australians took a clean sweep of the Test 5 – 0 , Ponsford 's highest score in the four Tests he played was 34 ; he totalled 97 runs at an average of 19 @.@ 40 . It was Bradman who dominated with the bat for Australia , scoring four centuries and 806 runs overall . 
 = = = Bodyline = = = 
 In a response to the record @-@ breaking feats of Don Bradman , the English team that toured Australia in 1932 – 33 — led by Douglas Jardine — adopted a tactic of fast , short pitched bowling directed at the body , later known as Bodyline . While Bodyline sought to curb Bradman , it was used against all the Australian batsmen , including Ponsford . After being bowled twice behind his legs — by Larwood for 32 in the first innings and for two in the second innings by Bill Voce — in the first Test at Sydney , Ponsford was omitted from the team for the second Test at Melbourne . Ponsford returned for the third Test in Adelaide , batting down the order . The Test was controversial and highly acrimonious ; several Australian batsmen — including Woodfull and Bert Oldfield — were hit on the body and head from the English fast bowling . Ponsford was hit on several occasions during his innings of 85 ; he chose to turn his torso and take the rising balls on his body — especially on his left shoulder blade and backside — rather than risk a catch to the leg side fielders . When Ponsford returned to the dressing room after his dismissal , his team mates were amazed by the mass of bruises that covered his back and shoulders . Ponsford remarked to Bill O 'Reilly , " I wouldn 't mind having a couple more if I could get a hundred . " 
 After failing in the fourth Test , Ponsford was again dropped . The hostile barrage of short @-@ pitched bowling had a major impact on Ponsford 's technique and career . In the three Tests that Ponsford played during the Bodyline series , he estimated he was hit around fifty times . During the series Ponsford developed a habit of turning his back on the rising ball and , if hit , glowering at the affected bowler . While the manager of the England team , Pelham Warner , thought that Ponsford " met the fast @-@ leg theory in plucky and able style " , this behaviour was criticised by the British cricket writer , R. C. Robertson @-@ Glasgow . Bradman thought that the Bodyline tactics hastened Ponsford 's eventual retirement . 
 = = = Triumph and retirement = = = 
 After the disappointments of the Bodyline series , Ponsford returned to domestic cricket in 1933 – 34 , scoring 606 runs at an average of 50 @.@ 50 . At the end of the domestic season , he was selected for his third tour of England with the Australian team in 1934 . Illness again interrupted Ponsford 's English summer , causing him to miss the second Test at Lord 's . In the final two Tests of the series , the two record breakers — Ponsford and Bradman — combined in two remarkable partnerships . 
 In the fourth Test at Headingley , Bradman joined Ponsford at the fall of the third wicket when the Australians had scored only 39 runs ( 39 / 3 ) . By the time Ponsford was dismissed hit wicket for 181 , Australia were 427 / 4 ; the partnership had yielded 388 runs . Bradman went on to make 304 . The partnership was the highest ever in Test cricket at the time and as of 2009 is still the highest fourth wicket partnership for Australia . Wisden said of Ponsford 's innings " ... he hit the ball hard and placed it well when scoring in front of the wicket . Moreover , his defence was rock @-@ like in its steadiness and accuracy . " 
 With the series locked at 1 – 1 , the fifth and deciding Test at The Oval saw an even larger partnership between Bradman and Ponsford . The pair added 451 runs for the second wicket in an Australian total of 701 runs . Bradman scored 244 and Ponsford — again dismissed hit wicket — his highest Test score , 266 . This partnership remained the highest in Tests until 1991 and the highest for the second wicket until 1997 . As of 2009 , it remains the highest ever in Australian Test history . Again Wisden was complimentary , saying " It would be hard to speak in too high terms of praise of the magnificent displays of batting given by Ponsford and Bradman " but noted that " Before Bradman joined him Ponsford had shown an inclination to draw away from the bowling of Bowes . " 
 In the four Tests that Ponsford for the English summer , he made 569 runs at an average of 94 @.@ 83 . His performance saw him named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1935 . 
 It is , perhaps , scarcely too much to say that English bowlers last summer thought he was every bit as difficult to get rid of as Bradman . Never a graceful or elegant batsman , Ponsford could with greater emphasis be called sound and workmanlike . He seemed in 1934 to hit the ball much harder than when he was here in 1926 and 1930 , while his placing improved out of all knowledge . A delivery overpitched to any degree , he almost invariably punished to the full , while he could cut and turn the ball to leg with great certainty . 
 Upon their return to Australia , a testimonial match was arranged on behalf of the two Victorian opening batsmen , Woodfull and Ponsford . Woodfull — the senior member of the partnership — had announced his retirement from first @-@ class cricket before returning from England and the press had speculated that Ponsford would succeed him as captain of Victoria . Walking out to bat in the match , the pair were cheered by the crowd to the strains of " For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow " . Together , the two Bills made another century partnership , before Ponsford was dismissed for 83 ; Woodfull went on to make a century . 
 During the match , to the surprise of the public , the press and his team mates , Ponsford announced his retirement from first @-@ class cricket at the relatively young age of 34 . His announcement remarked upon the changing atmosphere in high level cricket and touched on the effects of Bodyline . 
 I am feeling the strain of the last tour . I am thirty four and when you get to that age you start to lose your keenness . ... Test cricket has become too serious . It is not a game anymore but a battle ... I can remember when it was all quite different to what it is now . I do not want to refer to that " bodyline " business — I am out of all that . Cricket was a different game before bodyline . Naturally I have a tinge of regret ... but it is better to go out of cricket before being dropped . 
 Woodfull remarked that Ponsford 's retirement was premature , while team mate and journalist Jack Fingleton believed that the task of maintaining such high standards had affected Ponsford 's nervous energy : " At the age of 34 he felt that he never wanted to see a bat or a cricket game again . " Arthur Mailey suspected that Ponsford 's sensitivity to criticism , especially from the media , was a key factor behind the early retirement . The memory of being omitted from the Australian side twice during the Bodyline series also stung Ponsford sorely . Ponsford continued playing for the Melbourne Cricket Club until 1939 , but never represented his state or country again .

 Ponsford began his working life at the State Savings Bank . On his return from England in 1926 , the bank advised him that they might not tolerate so much leave for cricket in the future . Ponsford received a lucrative offer to play for Blackpool Cricket Club , which he was inclined to accept . This news was received with dismay by Australian fans , who had earlier seen players such as Ted McDonald leave Australia and accept contracts in the professional English leagues . To keep Ponsford in Melbourne , The Herald — a local newspaper — employed him on the basis that he would remain available for all representative cricket . The new role included writing articles for the paper . 
 In 1932 , at the end of his five @-@ year contract with the newspaper , Ponsford successfully applied for a position on the staff of the Melbourne Cricket Club . He was appointed to an unspecified office job working for the club secretary Hugh Trumble , which required him to transfer his cricket and baseball allegiances from St Kilda to Melbourne . The Herald unsuccessfully tried to retain his services , and Keith Murdoch — the Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Herald , and later , the father of Rupert Murdoch — visited the Ponsford home to lobby against the move . Ponsford 's new role included managing the staffing arrangements and crowd control at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for Australian rules football and cricket matches . In 1956 , following the retirement of Vernon Ransford , Ponsford unsuccessfully applied for the position of club secretary , effectively its chief executive officer and one of the most prestigious positions in Australian cricket . However , in the event recently retired Test cricketer Ian Johnson was appointed to the position . Ponsford remained with the club until his retirement in June 1969 . 
 Ponsford met Vera Neill at his local Methodist church ; the pair married in 1924 and settled in the Melbourne suburb of Caulfield South . They had two sons , Bill Jr. and Geoff . Ponsford became a Freemason in 1922 and continued in the movement until 1985 , retiring with the rank of Master Mason . During the Second World War , Ponsford attempted to volunteer with the Royal Australian Air Force , but was rejected on account of his colour blindness . In 1978 , four years after the death of his wife , Ponsford moved in with his son , Geoff , at Woodend in rural Victoria , and was an active lawn bowler . An infection after an operation in 1988 saw Ponsford admitted to a nursing home in nearby Kyneton . He died there on 6 April 1991 ; at the time he was Australia 's oldest living Test cricketer . 
 = = = Baseball = = = 
 Baseball was a reasonably popular sport in Australia in the early 20th century and Ponsford alternated between cricket and baseball throughout his sporting life . At the time , baseball was generally played in Australia during the winter months , as many of the leading players were enthusiastic cricketers who viewed the sport as a means of improving their fielding skills . As with cricket , Ponsford started his baseball career at Alfred Crescent School , where his coach was the former Victorian player Charles <unk> . As a junior Ponsford played shortstop , later as a senior for the Fitzroy Baseball Club he converted to catching . 
 Ponsford improved rapidly and by 1913 he was included in the Victorian schoolboys side for a tournament in Adelaide . He was again selected in the following year — now as a catcher — representing his state at the first national schoolboys championship in Sydney . The tournament coincided with a visit to Australia by two professional major league teams from the United States — the Chicago White Sox and the New York Giants . The manager of the Giants , John " Mugsy " McGraw , watched part of the tournament ; the Ponsford family claim that McGraw was so impressed with Ponsford 's skills that he later spoke to Ponsford 's parents about the possibility of Bill playing in the United States . 
 In 1919 , Ponsford was selected for Victoria 's baseball team , alongside future Test cricket team mate Jack Ryder . In 1923 , The Sporting Globe claimed that Ponsford was " ... the best batter of the season . ... Indeed , as an all @-@ round man , it is doubtful if he has a superior in the state . " In 1925 , Ponsford captained the Victorian team and was selected as centre fielder in an Australian representative team that played three matches against an outfit from the United States Pacific Fleet , which had docked in Melbourne . Over the three matches , won by the Australians , Ponsford made five safe hits , gained eight bases and his batting average was .357 . Ponsford 's next match against American opposition was against a team from Stanford University that visited Australia in 1927 . Ponsford 's Victorian team defeated Stanford 5 – 3 ; it was the visitors ' only loss on the tour . 
 Ponsford simultaneously retired from baseball and cricket in 1934 . In his newspaper column , he said that he liked both sports equally . He felt that baseball gave a player more opportunities to perform : " In cricket you may have the bad luck to get out early ; which often means a blank afternoon . It is not so with baseball ; you are in the game all the time . " Joe Clark , the author of History of Australian Baseball , said " Ponsford is considered by many to be the best <unk> of his time in Australia . " The official program for the 1952 Claxton Shield — held in Perth — made a similar claim . 
 One name in Australian baseball stands pre @-@ eminent above all others and that is the name of Bill Ponsford ... During his long career he was a star outfielder , perhaps the finest third baseman to represent his state and certainly as a catcher the equal of anybody . ... But it was as a batter that Bill outshone anyone ... Ponsford could , and did , hit to any part of a baseball field at will , and would nominate innings by innings , where he would hit the ball ... Ponsford will always remain amongst the greatest sportsmen of all time .

 In first @-@ class cricket , Ponsford scored 13 @,@ 819 runs at an average of 65 @.@ 18 , as of 2009 the fifth highest complete career average of any player , worldwide . Ponsford was not satisfied with merely making centuries ; he strove to score 200 and more . Arriving in big cricket a few years before Bradman , for a time Ponsford was considered the heaviest scorer in cricket history . Jack Fingleton claimed that " The true perspective of Ponsford 's deeds had barely dawned on the game when Bradman ruthlessly thrust him from public thought ... " 
 Apart from Brian Lara , Ponsford is the only man to twice score 400 runs in a first @-@ class innings and along with Bradman and Wally Hammond , he remains one of only three men to have scored four triple @-@ centuries . His 437 against Queensland is , as at 2009 , still the fifth highest score in first @-@ class cricket . 
 Ponsford was known for batting in partnerships , sharing in five that amassed over 375 runs each . Ponsford and his long @-@ time partner , Woodfull , were known as " the two Bills " , " Willy Wo and Willy Po " and " Mutt and Jeff " amongst other names . Together , the pair made 23 century partnerships ; 12 of these exceeded 150 runs . Ponsford 's other prolific partnership was with Bradman . In two Tests in 1934 , the pair set records that still stand today : 
 The highest partnership for Australia in Test cricket and the highest for the second wicket : 451 
 The third highest partnership for Australia in Test cricket and the highest for Australia for the fourth wicket : 388 
 Cricket writer Ray Robinson said of the pair batting together , " [ Ponsford ] was the only one who could play in Bradman 's company and make it a duet . " 
 For services to cricket , Ponsford was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) in the 1982 New Year Honours announced on 31 December 1981 . Ponsford was one of the ten inaugural inductees when the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame was launched in 1996 . In 2000 , Ponsford and Arthur Morris were chosen to open the batting for the Australian Cricket Board 's Team of the Century , a theoretical selection of the best team of Australian cricketers of the 20th century . In 2001 , Ponsford was selected in the Melbourne Cricket Club Team of the Century . 
 In 1986 the Western Stand of the Melbourne Cricket Ground was renamed the " Ponsford Stand " . Ponsford was described by his son as being " tickled pink " by the honour , but that he would only agree to the renaming if he was not required to participate in any public appearance or media interview . As part of the ongoing modernisation of the MCG the Ponsford Stand was torn down ; the new stand was completed in 2004 and again named in his honour . A statue of the cricketer was installed outside the Ponsford Stand in 1995 — one of a series in place around the stadium commemorating Australia 's sporting heroes .

 Answering to the nickname of " Puddin ' " , Ponsford was a thickset man , weighing in at around 13 stone ( 83 kg ) during his playing career . Despite this , he was known for his quick footwork , and was regarded as an excellent player of spin bowling . Ponsford was noted for his ability to maintain intense levels of concentration for extended periods . He possessed a strong cut shot and he drove through mid off powerfully , although critics noted that his backlift was not completely straight . He had a tendency to shuffle too far to the off ; this exposed his leg stump and he was bowled behind his legs on six occasions in Tests against England . However , Ray Robinson felt that " no bowler could have got a marble , much less a [ cricket ] ball between his bat and his left leg . " 
 Fingleton wrote , " He crouched a little at the crease ... he tapped the ground impatiently with his bat while awaiting the ball , and his feet were so eager to be on the move that they began an impulsive move forward just before the ball was bowled . This was the shuffle that sometimes took him across the pitch against a fast bowler ; but , that aside , his footwork was perfection . I never saw a better <unk> of the ball to the on @-@ side , and for this stroke his body moved beautifully into position . " However , Ponsford was not a stylish batsman . Bradman said " There were more beautiful players , but for absolute efficiency and results where can one turn to equal [ Ponsford ] ? " Robinson described Ponsford as the " founder of total batting , the first to make a habit of regarding 100 as merely the opening battle in a campaign for a larger triumph . " The New South Wales and Australian bowler Arthur Mailey later said that " I don 't think it was the <unk> <unk> enjoyed so much as the bowlers ' discomfort , especially when those bowlers came from New South Wales . " 
 Ponsford used a heavy bat — 2 pounds 10 ounces ( 1 @.@ 2 kg ) — nicknamed " Big Bertha " . Opposition players sometimes joked that Ponsford 's bat was larger than allowed under the laws of cricket and indeed in one match in Sydney , it was found to be slightly larger than permitted — the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting . Throughout his innings , Ponsford would pull his cap further to the left . Robinson claimed that " if you saw the peak at a rakish angle towards his left ear you could tell he was heading for his second hundred " . When volunteering for service with the Royal Australian Air Force , Ponsford discovered he possessed abnormal colour vision , unable to distinguish red from green . The examining doctor was astonished and asked Ponsford , " What colour did [ the ball ] look to you after it was worn ? " Ponsford replied , " I never noticed its colour , only its size . " A later study identified Ponsford 's specific colour vision as <unk> , a form of <unk> in which red appears dark . Ponsford did not enjoy batting on rain @-@ affected wickets . When on tour his team mates did not ask if it had rained last night , merely " Did <unk> wake during the night ? " — legend had it that even the slightest trickle would wake him and have him <unk> over having to bat on the " sticky " in the morning . 
 Ponsford was a shy person , on the field and off . Robinson wrote that Ponsford " was so reserved that you had to know him for three years or the duration of a Test tour before his reticence relaxed . " Similarly , when photographed Ponsford would hang his head so his cap would cover most of his face . This shyness intensified after his retirement . He would often walk along <unk> to his work at the MCC , rather than be recognised on the way to the train station . While on the train , he would cover his face with the newspaper . At work , he disliked interaction with the public and would direct staff to advise visitors that he was not in , despite often being clearly in view . Bill O 'Reilly said of Ponsford , " He spoke rarely and even then only if he could improve on silence . " Nonetheless he was popular with his team mates and was said to have a droll sense of humour . 
 = Military history of Asian Americans = 
 Asian Americans , who are Americans of Asian descent , have fought and served on behalf of the United States since the War of 1812 . During the American Civil War Asian Americans fought for both the Union and the Confederacy . Afterwards Asian Americans served primarily in the U.S. Navy until the Philippine – American War . 
 At the beginning of the 20th century , Asian Americans began to attend U.S. military academies , and the first Asian Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor . World War I saw Asian Americans serving as " non @-@ whites " in the National Army . After World War I , Asian American service fell into obscurity until World War II when significant contributions by Japanese , Chinese , Filipino , and Korean Americans were documented . 
 With the desegregation of the U.S. military in 1948 , segregated Asian American units ceased to exist , and Asian Americans served in integrated armed forces . Asian American combatants in the Korean and Vietnam conflicts were awarded the Medal of Honor , and Asian Americans have continued to serve into the present day .

 = = = 19th century = = = 
 There are anecdotal accounts of Filipino American sailors serving as early as the Revolutionary War . However , the first official recorded history of Asian Americans fighting on behalf of the U.S. occurred in 1815 during the War of 1812 . General Andrew Jackson recorded that " <unk> " had fought under his general command in defense of New Orleans , under the direct command of Jean Baptiste Lafitte . Following the war , at least one Filipino American , Augustin Feliciano , continued to serve in the U.S. Navy . After this Asian Americans were not recorded in the annals of U.S. military history until the American Civil War when , in 1861 , a Chinese American by the name of John <unk> joined the New York Infantry , eventually dying of wounds received at the Battle of Gettysburg . 
 Joseph Pierce ( his chosen name ) was brought to the U.S. from China by his adoptive father , Connecticut ship Captain Amos Peck . Pierce enlisted on 26 July 1862 and was mustered into the Fourteenth Regiment , Company F of the Connecticut Volunteer Infantry that became part of the Second Brigade of the Third Division , Second Army Corps of the Army of the Potomac . From 1862 to 1865 , Pierce fought in pivotal battles of the war , fighting in major campaigns from Antietam to Gettysburg to Lee 's surrender at Appomattox Court House . Pierce achieved the highest rank of any Chinese American to serve in the Union Army , reaching the rank of corporal . Pierce 's picture hangs in the Gettysburg Museum . In 2007 , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the actions of Pierce and other Asian @-@ Pacific Islander soldiers of the Civil War . 
 William Ah Hang , a Chinese American , became one of the first Asian Americans to enlist in the U.S. Navy in 1863 . In total more than 50 Chinese Americans fought , on both sides , in the Civil War . Of those who served , only a handful received recognition of their service in the form of pension , benefits , or citizenship . An exception was Ching Lee , who took the alias Thomas Sylvanus and served in the 81st Pennsylvania Regiment . 
 There are accounts of Filipino Americans serving in Louisiana for the Confederacy during the Civil War ; one served aboard the C.S.S. Alabama , and some served in the Louisiana Zouaves . Another Filipino American , Felix Cornelius <unk> , served in the Union 's Michigan 11th Infantry . 
 During the Civil War the Bunker family , were supporters of the Confederacy . Christopher Wren Bunker and Stephen Bunker , the eldest sons of Chang and Eng Bunker , the original " Siamese Twins " , joined different Confederate cavalry units . In 1864 , Christopher Wren Bunker was captured , and was sent to Camp Chase . 
 Another lull in recordings of Asian American service followed the end of the Civil War until the Spanish American War . When the U.S.S. Maine sank in Havana Harbor , seven of the casualties were Japanese Americans and one was a Chinese American . Later in the war it was recorded that Japanese Americans served aboard U.S. warships in the Battle of Manila Bay ; the Philippine – American War , previously known as the Philippine Insurrection , followed . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 = = = = Philippine – American War = = = = 
 In 1901 the Philippine Constabulary and Philippine Scouts were initially founded to assist the U.S. against the forces of the First Philippine Republic and the insurgency that followed after its collapse . That same year President William McKinley signed an executive order to allow 500 Filipinos to enlist in the U.S. Navy . From these routes of enlistment came the first Asian American recipients of the Medal of Honor . Private Jose <unk> , a Philippine Scout , protected his party from Moros ; for this action , he received the Medal of Honor in 1911 . In 1915 , Fireman Second Class <unk> Trinidad , along with Ensign Robert Webster Cary , was awarded the Medal of Honor for saving fellow crewmembers when the boiler of the U.S.S. San Diego exploded . As of 2011 , Trinidad has been the only Asian American recipient of the naval version of the Medal of Honor . 
 = = = = Early Asian American military academy graduates = = = = 
 In the late 1860s Asians were accepted into the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis . Matsumura <unk> was the first to graduate , doing so as part of the class 1873 . Matsumura was a foreign national , though , and like the other Asian graduates who attended around this time who went on to serve their own nations ' militaries , upon graduation he served in the Imperial Japanese Navy , eventually reaching the rank of captain . Nearly forty years passed before the first Asian American U.S. nationals followed in the footsteps of these foreign nationals and were accepted into the various U.S. military academies . Vicente Lim , was one of the first to graduate . A U.S. national from the Philippines , Lim graduated from West Point in the class of 1914 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Philippine Scouts . He was the first of a handful of Filipinos accepted into West Point under a quota system that required one Filipino to be appointed in each class , with no more than four being enrolled at any one time . Beginning in 1916 , Filipinos Americans were also accepted into Annapolis ; the first batch would enroll in 1919 . These graduates lost their status as U.S. nationals in 1935 , and many went on to serve in the fledgling Armed Forces of the Philippines . 
 = = = = Mexican Expedition = = = = 
 In the early 20th century , while the rest of the world was engulfed in the depths of World War I , the U.S. was looking to its south . Mexico had been embroiled in a civil war since 1910 , and in 1916 the violence spilt north over the border when Pancho Villa raided Columbus , New Mexico , killing 16 Americans . This culminated with a U.S. response , officially known as the Mexican Expedition , led by Major General John Pershing . A large number Chinese Mexicans assisted U.S. forces in Mexico during the expedition and upon its completion in early 1917 , they were threatened with hanging by Villa . Despite the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Act , Pershing sought permission for these people to be allowed to resettle in the U.S. A total of 527 eventually entered the country , settling mostly in San Antonio , and they later became known as " Pershing 's Chinese " . 
 = = = = World War I = = = = 
 In April 1917 , the U.S. entered World War I on the side of the Allies . The Philippine Islands created its own national guard units to join the effort , but did not see combat . The units were demobilized at Camp Thomas Claudio in 1918 . Within the United States , a draft was started , and alongside Hispanic and Native Americans , Asian Americans were drafted as " non @-@ whites " filling out the " white quota " in the National Army . Although , the majority of these did not see combat , several did , including : Private Tomas Mateo Claudio , who had studied at the University of Nevada and became the first , and only , Filipino American to die during the war , being killed at Château @-@ Thierry in 1918 ; Private Henry Chinn who was killed in action in the Argonne Forest while serving in the " Lost Battalion " ; Sergeant Sing Kee , another member of the Lost Battalion , who was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross ; and Sergeant Major <unk> Nishimura Slocum who served in the 328th Infantry Regiment , 82d Infantry Division . In the Navy , the number of enlisted Filipinos peaked at more than 5 @,@ 700 by the end of the war . Several thousand Chinese , Japanese , Korean , Vietnamese , and Filipinos eventually served in the U.S. military during World War I ; they were later allowed to become naturalized citizens , overcoming numerous legal obstacles . 
 = = = = Interwar period = = = = 
 During the interwar period U.S. forces were involved in several minor actions , including the Russian Civil War and multiple events in the Caribbean that have since become known as the Banana Wars ; also , the Yangtze Patrol was directly and indirectly affected by the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War and other events . Between 1918 and 1933 , at least 3 @,@ 900 Filipino Americans served in the U.S. Navy at any given time as mess stewards , having largely replaced African Americans in that rating . Up to World War I , Filipino sailors were able to serve in a range of occupations ; however , after World War I , a rule restricted Filipinos to the ratings of officer 's steward and mess attendant . 
 In 1934 , Gordon Pai <unk> Chung @-@ Hoon became the first Asian American U.S. citizen to graduate from the Naval Academy , and the first Asian American West Point graduate , Wing Fook Jung , graduated in 1940 . In 1940 , Japanese Americans were the largest ethnicity of Asian Americans , followed by ( in order of population ) Chinese Americans , Filipino Americans , Hindu Americans , and Korean Americans . 
 In 1937 , the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War began . A Chinese American , Arthur Chin , had gone to China in 1934 and joined the Republic of China Air Force , and flew as a fighter pilot . During the war Chin becoming the first American flying ace of World War II , with eight victories . He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Air Medal . 
 In September 1939 , war broke out in Europe following the German invasion of Poland . The U.S. officially remained neutral , but Americans became involved in combat while serving in other countries ' militaries in units such as the Flying Tigers in China and the Eagle Squadrons that served with the Royal Air Force shortly after the Battle of Britain ; U.S. forces also provided logistic support through the cash and carry program , and by undertaking convoy escort duties in the Atlantic . Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 , the U.S. officially declared war , and from that point on Asian Americans were on the front lines as U.S. civilians . Asian Americans from Oahu , including Japanese Americans , assisted with aid efforts following the attack . On the other side of the Pacific Ocean , Philippine Commonwealth forces , under U.S. command since July 1941 , prepared for an attack that would come nine hours later .

 Following the attack on Pearl Harbor , Japanese Americans in the Hawaii National Guard activated and began to guard the beaches , clear rubble , donate blood and aid the wounded but three days later , they were disarmed because of their ancestry . The next day , however , they were authorized to rearm , but an uneasy tension lasted until 5 June 1942 . At the same time , Japanese Americans who had been undertaking the ROTC program at the University of Hawaii , and who had been activated in the Hawaii Territorial Guard , were discharged on 19 January 1942 . Many of these discharged soldiers formed a Corps of Engineers auxiliary , known as the " Varsity Victory Volunteers " , in February 1942 . On 5 June 1942 , 1 @,@ 400 Nisei of the Hawaii National Guard shipped out from Hawaii bound for Oakland and on 12 June , after docking , they were formed into the 100th Infantry Battalion . Afterwards , all Japanese American men , not already in the military , were classified as enemy aliens ; this policy was reversed in 1943 . 
 Eight months later the decision was made to raise an all @-@ Nisei regiment , known as the 442nd Regimental Combat Team . Progress was slow at first , and another four months passed before the 442nd began training ; two months after that , though , the 100th shipped out to Europe . Initially , the notion of employing Japanese American soldiers was rejected by General Dwight D. Eisenhower 's staff at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force , but they were eventually accepted by Lieutenant General Mark Clark 's Fifth Army . While the 442nd was training in the U.S. , the 100th sustained heavy losses , eventually earning the title the " Purple Heart Battalion . " On 26 June 1944 , two weeks after the 442nd arrived in Europe , the two Nisei units combined to form one single unit , but those who had been a part of the 100th wanted to keep their numerical designation , so they replaced the regiment 's 1st Battalion . Keeping with the policy at the time , the unit was segregated , and large number of the other members of the 442nd RCT were previously interned Japanese Americans from the continental United States , commanded by mostly white officers . The combat chronicle of the regiment became a highly storied one , resulting in it becoming one of the most decorated units in the European Theater , taking part in numerous actions in Italy , France and Germany , including the liberation of Dachau concentration camp . 
 The 442nd Regiment was the most decorated unit for its size and length of service in the history of American warfare . The 4 @,@ 000 men who initially made up the unit in April 1943 had to be replaced nearly 2 @.@ 5 times . In total , about 14 @,@ 000 men served , earning 9 @,@ 486 Purple Hearts . The unit was awarded eight Presidential Unit Citations ( five earned in one month ) . 
 Additionally , Japanese Americans also contributed to the war effort in the Pacific Front serving in the Military Intelligence Service , helping with the decoding of Japanese intelligence and the rebuilding of occupied Japan ; the first Asian American women to enter the U.S. military served within this unit through the Women 's Army Corps . More than a dozen volunteers from the 442nd were selected to join the Office of Strategic Services and were selected for service in India and Burma , where they conducted covert operations , translation , interrogation , and signal intelligence . Over 33 @,@ 000 Japanese Americans served in the military during World War II . Upon returning home , Japanese American service members found old prejudices remained . 
 In 1946 , one of the 442nd 's soldiers , PFC Sadao <unk> , was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the regiment 's service in Italy . His award was one of two made to Asian Americans during , or in the immediate aftermath of , the war , and the only one made to a Japanese American . However , in 2000 , after a review of other medals awarded to the 442nd , 21 were elevated to Medals of Honor . One of those 21 was presented to Hawaiʻi Senator , and former Captain , Daniel K. Inouye . On 5 October 2010 , Congress created the Congressional Gold Medal recognizing the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion , as well as the 6 @,@ 000 Japanese Americans who served in the Military Intelligence Service during the war . 
 = = = = = Chinese Americans = = = = = 
 It has been estimated that between 12 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 Chinese American men , representing up to 22 percent of the men in their portion of the U.S. population , served during World War II . Of those serving about 40 percent were not citizens , and unlike Japanese and Filipino Americans , 75 percent served in non @-@ segregated units . Chinese Americans distinguished themselves from Japanese Americans , and suffered less discrimination . A quarter of those would serve in the U.S. Army Air Forces , some of were sent to the Chinese @-@ Burma @-@ India theater for service with the 14th Air Service Group and the Chinese @-@ American Composite Wing . Another 70 percent would go on to serve in the U.S. Army in various units , including the 3rd , 4th , 6th , 32nd and 77th Infantry Divisions . Prior to the war , the U.S. Navy had recruited Chinese Americans but they had been restricted to serve only as stewards ; this continued until May 1942 , when restrictions ceased and they were allowed to serve in other ratings . In 1943 , Chinese American women were accepted into the Women 's Army Corps in the Military Intelligence Service . They were also recruited for service in the Army Air Force , with a few later becoming civilian Women Airforce Service Pilots . 
 Captain Francis Wai of the 34th Infantry was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for actions on the island of Leyte in late 1944 ; this awarding was later elevated to a Medal of Honor in the 2000 review . Wilbur Carl Sze became the first Chinese American officer commissioned in the Marine Corps .

 From the beginning , the Philippines was on the front lines of the new war , as it was attacked shortly after Pearl Harbor . Under the command of General Douglas MacArthur , initially plans were made to defend all of the islands , but following the Japanese landings on Luzon , the US reinstated War Plan Orange and a hasty withdrawal to the Bataan Peninsula followed , denying Japan the use of Manila Bay . In March 1942 , under orders from President Franklin D. Roosevelt , MacArthur departed the Philippines . In April 1942 , Major General Edward P. King surrendered his force as they could no longer keep up a sustainable defense . Of the 75 @,@ 000 that surrendered , about 63 @,@ 000 were Filipinos , and a thousand were Chinese Filipinos . Forced to march to San Fernando , Pampanga , in what later came to be called the Bataan Death March , between 5 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 Filipinos died along the way . A smaller force held out at Fort Mills ; however , after an assault , Lieutenant General Jonathan Wainwright surrendered the USAFFE forces that remained in the Philippines in May 1942 . Of those who surrendered , 23 were Filipino officers who had graduated from West Point ; Japanese forces executed six of these Filipino prisoners of war , including Vicente Lim , who had by then reached the rank of brigadier general . 
 In the U.S. , Filipinos were initially blocked from enlisting , until the laws were revised a day before Japan had begun its invasion back in the Philippines . Of the Filipinos who lived in California , two @-@ fifths , or sixteen thousand Filipinos , attempted to enlist into the U.S. Army . Some would serve in non @-@ segregated units , yet a segregated infantry battalion was established , which continued to grow and at its peak was split into two units known as the 1st and 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiments . These soldiers were subjected to discrimination during their time training at Camp Beale and Fort Ord , sometimes being mistaken for Japanese Americans when off base . Nevertheless , these units would serve with distinction similar to that of the 442d Infantry Regiment , although their deeds were not as well documented or widely known . By the end of the war , a total of 50 @,@ 000 decorations , awards , medals , ribbons , certificates , commendations and citations had been awarded to personnel assigned to these two regiments for their service in the New Guinea and Philippines campaigns . 
 Back in the Philippines , some individual service members and units refused to heed orders to surrender . They began a guerilla campaign to resist the Japanese occupation and were later joined by paroled Filipino USAFFE soldiers , as well as Filipino civilians , and other Allied forces that had been inserted into the islands . Allied forces returned to the Philippines in significant numbers during the Battle of Leyte . These included the Filipino infantry units which had been reduced in size from their peak . Later that year the Philippine Division was reconstituted , and in 1945 those members who elected to remain in the Philippines at the end of the war were transferred to the <unk> . In all approximately 142 @,@ 000 Filipinos served during World War II . When recognized guerrillas are taken into account , the number of Filipinos who served increases to over 250 @,@ 000 , and possibly up to over 400 @,@ 000 . This number though is smaller than that recognized for serving in World War II by the Philippines . 
 Sergeant Jose Calugas became the third Asian American ever and first Asian American during World War II , to receive the Medal of Honor ; he would not receive the medal until after the occupation had ended . Later , in the 2000 review of medals awarded to Asian Americans , First Lieutenant Rudolph Davila 's Distinguished Service Cross was elevated to a Medal of Honor . While in New Guinea , Lieutenant Colonel Leon <unk> became the first Asian American to command white troops in combat . For their actions in aiding Allied prisoners of war during the Japanese Occupation of the Philippines , Josefina Guerrero and Florence Finch were both awarded the Medal of Freedom ; Finch later enlisted in the Coast Guard Women 's Reserve after being liberated from the Philippines and taken to New York . 
 = = = = = Korean Americans = = = = = 
 After a treaty was signed in 1882 , Koreans had begun migrating to the U.S. This came to an end when Japan annexed Korea in 1910 . When the war began , Korean Americans were treated as enemy aliens , although this changed in 1943 , when they were exempted from enemy alien status . About 100 enlisted in the U.S. Army over the course of the war , some of whom served as translators . Over a hundred joined the California National Guard in Los Angeles alone and formed a unit that became known as the " Tiger Brigade " . Young @-@ Oak Kim , who had initially been rejected by the Army before being drafted , served as an enlisted soldier in the engineers until he was selected for commissioning in 1943 . He went on to serve in the mainly Japanese American 442nd Infantry Regiment , and he was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions at the Battle of Anzio . The only Korean American to be awarded that medal during the war , he also received a Silver Star and Purple Heart for actions earlier in the campaign . Fred <unk> , who initially enlisted as a trooper in the 116th Cavalry in 1938 , became the only Korean American fighter ace of World War II , shooting down a total of six enemy aircraft and eventually rising to command the 52nd Fighter Group 's 2d Fighter Squadron in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations . As of 8 March 2012 , he is the only Korean American to achieve the status of ace , and for his actions , <unk> received several medals including the Silver Star with one bronze oak leaf cluster .

 After the surrender of Japan , World War II came to an end , and the U.S. military began to demobilize . Millions of service @-@ members were transported home , including the 442nd Regimental Combat Team . In 1946 , the regiment was reviewed by President Truman who awarded them their seventh Distinguished Unit Citation . They were subsequently deactivated , but they were reorganized a year later as part of the U.S. Army Reserve . That same year , Truman signed the <unk> Act of 1946 , which denied Filipinos who served during World War II in the Commonwealth military and guerrillas , benefits that were afforded to other veterans . With the consent of the Philippine government , 50 @,@ 000 Philippine Scouts were authorized by Congress , retained , and recruited . As part of the Philippine Division , this force undertook occupation duty on Okinawa until 1947 , when the Philippine Scouts were disbanded by presidential order after Truman came to view them as a mercenary organization . In 1947 , the signing of the <unk> Military Bases Agreement formalized Filipino enlistment in the U.S. Navy without immigrant credentials . In 1948 , Truman ordered the desegregation of the U.S. military . 
 = = = = = Korean War = = = = = 
 Following Truman 's order for the integration of the U.S. military , the majority of segregated Asian American units were disbanded by 1951 . Many individuals continued to serve in integrated units following desegregation , although the exact number of Asian Americans who served during the Korean War has not been determined . Despite the official acceptance of the desegregation policy , some units , including the 100th Battalion , 442nd Infantry Regiment , and the 5th Regimental Combat Team , retained strong racial ties , with a predominant number of Asian Americans serving in these units . Of the 36 @,@ 572 who died during the Korean War , 241 were Asian Americans . 
 One Asian American received the Medal of Honor for actions during the Korean War . This went to Japanese American Corporal Hiroshi Miyamura of the 7th Infantry Regiment ; the awarding of the medal was initially made in secret , as at the time Miyamura was being held by North Koreans as a prisoner of war . Three brothers , Kurt Chew @-@ Een Lee ( the first Chinese American Marine officer ) , Chew @-@ Mon Lee ( an army infantry officer ) , and Chew @-@ Fan Lee ( an army medical service officer ) , all served in different units during the conflict and were awarded the Navy Cross , Distinguished Service Cross , and Bronze Star Medal respectively . Young @-@ Oak Kim , having reenlisted and promoted to major , became the first ethnic minority to command a regular combat battalion , the 1st of the 31st Infantry . Walter Tsukamoto , who was first commissioned in 1927 and entered active duty in 1943 , was sent from occupation duty in Japan to Korea in 1950 and was promoted to lieutenant colonel , the first Asian American to achieve that rank in the Army Judge Advocate General 's Corps , served as the senior ranking judge advocate for X Corps and was awarded two Bronze Star Medals for his service in Korea .

 During the Vietnam War 35 @,@ 000 Asian Americans served as part of the more than eight million U.S. service personnel that were deployed to South Vietnam , in fully integrated units . Three of them were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor , including Corporal Terry Kawamura who was , as of March 2014 , the last Asian American to receive that medal . During the conflict , in addition to the Asian American personnel that served in conventional units , the Army also formed a special forces team of Chinese , Filipino , Japanese , and Native American Rangers called Team Hawaii , as they could pass for Vietnamese and conduct long range reconnaissance . Discrimination and racism continued to be experience by Asian Americans who served during the conflict . Their loyalty was questioned , and during basic training they were sometimes described as being similar to the Viet Cong . In country , some were fired upon when mistaken for the Viet Cong , and some had medical care delayed after being mistaken for North Vietnamese . Additionally , the Viet Cong especially targeted Asian American service members , sometimes putting a price on their heads . Proportionally , Asian Americans suffered less casualties compared to other ethnic groups in Vietnam , with a total of 139 Asian American servicemen dying during the conflict . 
 Many other then @-@ future Asian Americans serve the military out of its normal ranks during the conflict . These included groups such as the Hmong and Laotians who fought alongside American service members in the Laotian Civil War , Vietnamese Americans who fought as members of the South Vietnam 's armed forces , and Montagnard ( also known as <unk> ) who assisted American forces . 
 Throughout the war , Filipino American sailors remained restricted to the rating of steward , with 80 % of the almost seventeen thousand Filipino American sailors being stewards . In 1970 , there were more Filipinos serving in the U.S. Navy than there were in the Philippine Navy . The restriction ended in 1973 , after the U.S. Senate investigated civil rights issues in the U.S. Navy and opened all ratings to Filipino Americans . In the White House , Filipinos Navy stewards , continued to serve as valets after the restriction was lifted , as late as into the 1990s . By 1989 , Asian Americans made up approximately 2 @.@ 3 percent of the total armed services , slightly greater than their proportion of the total U.S. population at that time ( 1 @.@ 6 percent ) .

 Great Moments in Aviation is a 1994 British romantic drama film set on a 1950s passenger liner . The film follows Gabriel Angel ( Rakie Ayola ) , a young Caribbean aviator who falls in love with the forger Duncan Stewart ( Jonathan Pryce ) on her journey to England . Stewart is pursued by his nemesis Rex Goodyear ( John Hurt ) , and the group are supported by Dr Angela Bead ( Vanessa Redgrave ) and Miss Gwendolyn Quim ( Dorothy Tutin ) , retired missionaries who become lovers during the voyage . 
 The film was written by Jeanette Winterson , directed by Beeban Kidron and produced by Phillippa Gregory , the same creative team that collaborated on Winterson 's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in 1990 . Winterson intended the screenplay to be reminiscent of a fairytale , and was unhappy at being asked to write a new ending for its American release . 
 The film was shown at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and broadcast on British television in 1995 . Although originally intended for theatrical release , it failed to find a theatrical distributor , and was released straight to video in the United States in 1997 under the title Shades of Fear . The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics , and while the lesbian sub @-@ plot in particular was generally well received , Winterson 's scripting was a focal point of criticism . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Set in 1957 , Great Moments in Aviation follows Gabriel Angel ( Rakie Ayola ) , a young Caribbean woman from Grenada who embarks on a cruise to England with the intention of becoming an aviator . Upon boarding the ship , Gabriel finds herself assigned shared sleeping quarters with fellow passenger Duncan Stewart ( Jonathan Pryce ) . The rest of the ship 's passengers , including missionaries Angela Bead ( Vanessa Redgrave ) and Gwendolyne Quim ( Dorothy Tutin ) assume the two are married , and when Professor Rex Goodyear ( John Hurt ) appears to recognise Duncan as his old acquaintance Alasdair Birch , Duncan fosters the assumption to maintain his cover . It transpires that Duncan is a forger , who many years ago stole a Titian painting from Goodyear and had an affair with his wife . Goodyear believes that his painting is on board the ship , and leads Gabriel to believe that Duncan was responsible for his wife 's death . She is furious with Duncan for lying to her , but the two go on to reconcile and later make love . Their romance is complicated by the fact Gabriel professes to have a husband waiting for her in England . She explains that he has been there for two years working , and she is joining him so that she can fulfil her lifelong dream of becoming a pilot — inspired by her grandfather Thomas ( Oliver Samuels ) who flew off into a storm and never came home . They begin a relationship nonetheless , supported by Angela and Gwendolyne , who also come to realise that they have feelings for one another . They each confess to having secretly been in love with the other for years , and become lovers , vowing to live together in their retirement . It comes to light that the death of Goodyear 's wife was an accident , caused as he and Duncan fought over her . Duncan returns his painting , and goes on to burn all his forged documents and papers in front of Gabriel . She confesses that her marriage to Michael is over , and she and Duncan resolve to begin a life together . The film ends with Gabriel 's grandmother <unk> ( Carmen Munroe ) reading her family a letter from England , informing them that Gabriel and Duncan are happy together , and are expecting a child . As the family express their delight , Gabriel flies overhead , having finally attained her pilot licence and become an aviator .

 Great Moments in Aviation was written by Jeanette Winterson , directed by Beeban Kidron and produced by Phillippa Giles , the same creative team who , in 1990 , adapted Winterson 's novel Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for television . Giles , for whom Great Moments was her first feature film , believes that it was the success of Oranges which lead the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) to approve the film so easily . The screenplay is inspired by the emigration story of the mother of actress Vicky <unk> , a close friend of Winterson . It is adapted from a short story Winterson wrote entitled " Atlantic Crossing " , published in 1999 in her anthology The World and Other Places . The central themes of the story are " race , Hemingway , colonialism , love , lust , the [ and the ] ' 50s " , adapted into the screenplay in a manner Winterson intended to be reminiscent of a fairytale . She ascribes the roles of hero and heroine to Duncan and Gabriel , fairy godmothers to Miss Quim and Dr Bead , and non @-@ archetypal villain to Rex Goodyear . Setting the film on a passenger liner , with brief scenes in Gabriel 's native Grenada were intended to contribute towards this fairytale atmosphere , with Winterson explaining that the opening sequence in the Caribbean is " designed to draw the audience out of the world of their own concerns and into a world whose customs are strange . In the new world , objects are unfamiliar and events do not follow the usual rules . The coincidence of colour and language , each more vivid than normal , pull the viewer forward with fairytale immediacy . " Of the passenger liner aspect , she explains that it provides the film with : " a sealed and contained world with its own identity and rituals , at once both recognisable and odd . Fairytale never leaves the reader in a familiar spot , we are whisked away to a wood or a lake or a castle or an island , each a law unto itself made all the more uncomfortable because it isn 't as weird as , say , planet Mars . We think we will be able to cope just by using out usual tool kit , how disconcerting it is when we can 't . " 
 The film originally had a different ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear . Miramax co @-@ founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution , and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional <unk> scene . Winterson 's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent , only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along , and has now destroyed it . This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson 's eyes , whereby " Duncan , Gabriel , Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it , Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless . " Winterson has called Weinstein " a bully who knows the gentle touch " , referring to the new ending as " the most expensive words I will ever write " . While she believes that the new ending is satisfying , she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes : " It is a good movie but it is not the movie I thought we could make . [ ... ] I do like Great Moments but there is another film in there somewhere that has got lost . " 
 Of the starring cast , Pryce , Hurt , Redgrave and Tutin were already established screen actors , while Ayola had previously only acted theatrically . She appraised of her screen debut : " it was a wonderful experience for me to be appearing alongside so many established names . It was very exciting although I must admit at first I was a bit daunted by the prospect . " The film featured several minor black characters , either as members of Gabriel 's family , or as workers aboard the ship . When these roles were cast , complaints were made by black members of the British actors ' union to the BBC and the Department of Employment at having been " passed over " in favour of overseas artists . The film was shot from 23 September to 6 November 1992 . It was funded in the most part by the BBC , though a quarter of the budget came from the American Miramax . While Kidron had previously come to dislike directing for major studios when filming My Cousin Vinny for Fox , she found the low budget of Great Moments in Aviation " just as horrendous a compromise " . Though originally intended for theatrical release , the film failed to find theatrical distribution . It was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994 , then broadcast in Britain on BBC Two on 11 November 1995 . It was released on video in the United States under the alternate title Shades of Fear two years later , on 11 November 1997 .

 The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics . Thomas Sutcliffe for The Independent writes that : " while flight is the sustaining theme , the film never soars . The characterisation is Cluedo with pretensions , and the dialogue suspends the actors in that ungainly , undignified dangle which you associate with stage flying , the wires robbing them of all powers of independent movement . " While he describes the scene which culminates the lesbian storyline as " radiant " and " beautifully acted by Vanessa Redgrave and Dorothy Tutin " , he opines of the acting in general that " for the most part , these people are simply Winterson 's puppets , jerked around by the symbolic demands of the plot . " He deems Kidron 's directing " a kind of surrender , dutifully supplying visual equivalents for Winterson 's sterile symmetries but despairing of any greater vivacity " , and is particularly critical of Winterson 's screenplay , noting that : " everything unrolls at the same stately pace , a religious procession bearing the reliquaries of Winterson 's prose . It 's as though the author thinks every word is infinitely precious . She 's right , though perhaps not in the way she imagines . " Variety ′ s David Rooney agrees the film 's coming @-@ out scene is a " potential jewel " and " <unk> played " , however , in line with Sutcliffe 's criticisms , opines that the film 's pacing means that " the scene is lobbed in and robbed of its impact " . He summarises the film as " a willfully theatrical , sporadically magical romantic comedy embracing three barely compatible narrative strands , not one of which ever gets full flight clearance " . Rooney deems the film " Damaged beyond repair by a mannered scripting style and evident <unk> " , and opines that " Jeanette Winterson 's preposterous dialogue and comic mistiming serves up more misses than hits " . Of the film 's major themes , he writes that : " Questions about the line between truth and falsehood , genuine and fake , are too <unk> voiced to mean much . Likewise , the intro of race issues in the closing voiceover only makes the haphazard mix even more lumpy " . 
 More positively , Rooney praise Remi <unk> 's cinematography and Rachel Portman 's soundtrack , as well as Ayola 's acting , writing : " In the film 's most naturalistic turn , Ayola is a constant pleasure to watch . <unk> and appealing , she often succeeds in pulling the fanciful fireworks momentarily back down to Earth . " The Boston Herald 's Paul Sherman agrees that Ayola gives " a winning performance " , and deems the film " generally charming " , though is critical of Miramax 's decision to hold the film 's release back until 1997 , change its title , and market it as a mystery rather than a romantic comedy @-@ drama . <unk> Haynes , writing for the Radio Times , also praises the acting in the film , however is critical of the cross @-@ genre approach , opining : " Unfortunately , the mixture of romance and mystery doesn 't work and even the combined acting talents of Vanessa Redgrave , Jonathan Pryce , John Hurt and Dorothy Tutin can 't save it . " She deems the film " disappointing " , and writes that it fails to match the success of Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit . Gilbert Gerard for The Independent selected the film as recommended viewing upon its BBC Two television debut , giving the mixed review : " So much acting talent , so little substance to play with - but the 1950s are authentically enough evoked . " 
 David Bleiler is more positive about the film , writing in his TLA Video & DVD Guide that it " isn 't some third @-@ rate , quick @-@ paycheck hack job mystery which the advertising suggests . " He calls it " an unusual , rewarding drama [ ... ] Well @-@ written by Jeanette Winterson and directed with just the right amount of sensitivity and humor by Kidron " . Bleiler states that the cast are " stellar " , Ayola is " radiant " , and the revelatory scene between Angela and Gwendolyne is " wonderful " , asserting : " Although slight , this is a perfect film for a nice , quiet evening at home " . Alison Darren in her Lesbian Film Guide is also positive , asserting that : " Great Moments in Aviation is a little gem of a British film " . She describes the resolution of the lesbian storyline as " a golden scene , beautifully photographed and exceptionally well paced " , and asserts that " For women of a certain age , this may be the most heart @-@ rending ( not to say , inspirational ) depiction of a coming @-@ out moment ever seen on screen . Whimsical , comic , dramatic and gentle . "

 = Anti @-@ nuclear movement in Australia = 
 Nuclear weapons testing , uranium mining and export , and nuclear power have often been the subject of public debate in Australia , and the anti @-@ nuclear movement in Australia has a long history . Its origins date back to the 1972 – 73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific and the 1976 – 77 debate about uranium mining in Australia . 
 Several groups specifically concerned with nuclear issues were established in the mid @-@ 1970s , including the Movement Against Uranium Mining and Campaign Against Nuclear Energy ( <unk> ) , cooperating with other environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and the Australian Conservation Foundation . The movement suffered a setback in 1983 when the newly elected Labor Government failed to implement its stated policy of stopping uranium mining . But by the late 1980s , the price of uranium had fallen , the costs of nuclear power had risen , and the anti @-@ nuclear movement seemed to have won its case ; <unk> was disbanded in 1988 . 
 About 2003 , proponents of nuclear power advocated it as a solution to global warming and the Australian government began taking an interest . Anti @-@ nuclear campaigners and some scientists in Australia argued that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources , and that uranium mining itself could become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions . 
 As of 2014 , Australia has no nuclear power stations but Ex @-@ Prime Minister Tony Abbott supports nuclear power for Australia . As of 2015 , Australia has five uranium mines , four of which are located in South Australia . Olympic Dam ( Roxby Downs ) is a large underground mine , Beverley , Four Mile and Honeymoon are in @-@ situ leach mines and Ranger in an open pit mine in the Northern Territory . Uranium mined in Australia is mainly for export . Australia has no nuclear weapons or nuclear @-@ powered vessels .

 In 1952 the Australian Government established the Rum Jungle Uranium Mine 85 kilometres south of Darwin . Local aboriginal communities were not consulted and the mine site became an environmental disaster . 
 Also in 1952 , the Liberal Government passed legislation , the Defence ( Special <unk> ) Act 1952 , which allowed the British Government access to remote parts of Australia to undertake atmospheric nuclear weapons tests . The general public were largely unaware of the risks from the testing program , stemming from official secrecy about the testing program and the remote locations of the test sites . But as the " Ban the Bomb " movement gathered momentum in Western societies throughout the 1950s , so too did opposition to the British tests in Australia . An opinion poll taken in 1957 showed 49 per cent of the Australian public were opposed to the tests and only 39 per cent in favour . In 1964 , Peace Marches which featured " Ban the bomb " placards , were held in several Australian capital cities . 
 In 1969 , a 500 MW nuclear power plant was proposed for the Jervis Bay Territory , 200 km south of Sydney . A local opposition campaign began , and the South Coast Trades and Labour Council ( covering workers in the region ) announced that it would refuse to build the reactor . Some environmental studies and site works were completed , and two rounds of tenders were called and evaluated , but in 1971 the Australian government decided not to proceed with the project , citing economic reasons .

 The 1972 – 73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific mobilised several groups , including some trade unions . In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand , and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott , ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll . In 1974 and 1975 this concern came to focus on uranium mining in Australia and several Friends of the Earth groups were formed . The Australian Conservation Foundation also began voicing concern about uranium mining and supporting the activities of the grass @-@ roots organisations . Concern about the environmental effects of uranium mining was a significant factor and poor management of waste at an early uranium mine , Rum Jungle , led it to become a significant pollution problem in the 1970s . The Australian anti @-@ nuclear movement also acquired initial impetus from notable individuals who publicly voiced nuclear concerns , such as nuclear scientists Richard Temple and Rob <unk> , and poets Dorothy Green and Judith Wright . 
 In 1975 , Moss Cass , Minister for the Environment and Conservation , led parliamentarians and ALP branch members in expressing concerns about the effects of uranium mining . A key concern was the adverse effect that uranium mining would have on the northern Aboriginal people . Cass said : " nuclear energy creates the most dangerous , insidious and persistent waste products , ever experienced on the planet " . 
 The years 1976 and 1977 saw uranium mining become a major political issue , with the Ranger Inquiry ( Fox ) report opening up a public debate about uranium mining . Several groups specifically concerned with nuclear issues were established , including the Movement Against Uranium Mining ( founded in 1976 ) and Campaign Against Nuclear Energy ( formed in South Australia in 1976 ) , cooperating with other environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth ( which came to Australia in 1975 ) and the Australian Conservation Foundation ( formed in 1975 ) . 
 In November and December 1976 , 7 @,@ 000 people marched through the streets of Australian cities , protesting against uranium mining . The Uranium Moratorium group was formed and it called for a five @-@ year <unk> on uranium mining . In April 1977 the first national demonstration co @-@ ordinated by the Uranium Moratorium brought around 15 @,@ 000 demonstrators into the streets of Melbourne , 5 @,@ 000 in Sydney , and smaller numbers elsewhere . A National signature campaign attracted over 250 @,@ 000 signatures calling for a five @-@ year moratorium . In August , another demonstration brought 50 @,@ 000 people out nationally and the opposition to uranium mining looked like a potential political force . 
 In 1977 , the National Conference of the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) passed a motion in favour of an indefinite moratorium on uranium mining , and the anti @-@ nuclear movement acted to support the Labor Party and help it regain office . However , a setback for the movement occurred in 1982 when another ALP conference overturned its anti @-@ uranium policy in favour of a " one mine policy " . After the ALP won power in 1983 , its 1984 National Conference voted in favour of a " Three mine policy " . This referred to the then three existing uranium mines in Australia , <unk> , Ranger and Roxby Downs / Olympic Dam , and articulated ALP support for pre @-@ existing mines and contracts , but opposition to any new mining . 
 In 1977 @-@ 78 , the West Australian Government , under the leadership of Charles Court , announced plans for a nuclear power reactor near Perth . 1977 was seen as the year of mass mobilization in WA , with 300 at the first anti @-@ nuclear demonstration to 9 @,@ 000 at the third protest in the inner city of Perth . Despite public protest , the WA Government selected a first site for a nuclear reactor in 1979 at <unk> , 70 kilometres north of Perth . Court predicted that at least another 20 nuclear power plants would be needed by the end of the century to meet rapidly growing power demand , but all of this never eventuated . 
 = = = 1980s and 1990s = = = 
 Between 1979 and 1984 , the majority of what is now Kakadu National Park was created , surrounding but not including the Ranger uranium mine . Tension between mining and conservation values led to long running controversy around mining in the Park region . 
 The two themes for the 1980 Hiroshima Day march and rally in Sydney , sponsored by the Movement Against Uranium Mining ( <unk> ) , were : " Keep uranium in the ground " and " No to nuclear war . " Later that year , the Sydney city council officially proclaimed Sydney nuclear @-@ free , in an action similar to that taken by many other local councils throughout Australia . 
 In the 1980s , academic critics ( such as Jim Falk ) discussed the " deadly connection " between uranium mining , nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons , linking Australia 's nuclear policy to nuclear proliferation and the " plutonium economy " . 
 In the 1980s , Australia experienced a significant growth of nuclear disarmament activism : 
 On Palm Sunday 1982 , an estimated 100 @,@ 000 Australians participated in anti @-@ nuclear rallies in the nation 's biggest cities . Growing year by year , the rallies drew 350 @,@ 000 participants in 1985 . The movement focused on halting Australia 's uranium mining and exports , abolishing nuclear weapons , removing foreign military bases from Australia 's soil , and creating a nuclear @-@ free Pacific . Public opinion surveys found that about half of Australians opposed uranium mining and export , as well as the visits of U.S. nuclear warships , that 72 percent thought the use of nuclear weapons could never be justified , and that 80 percent favoured building a nuclear @-@ free world . 
 The Nuclear Disarmament Party won a Senate seat in 1984 , but soon faded from the political scene . The years of the Hawke @-@ Keating ALP governments ( 1983 – 1996 ) were characterised by an " uneasy standoff in the uranium debate " . The ALP acknowledged community feeling against uranium mining but was reluctant to move against the industry . 
 The 1986 Palm Sunday anti @-@ nuclear rallies drew 250 @,@ 000 people . In Melbourne , the seamen 's union boycotted the arrival of foreign nuclear warships . 
 Australia 's only nuclear energy education facility , the former School of Nuclear Engineering at the University of New South Wales , closed in 1986 . 
 By the late 1980s , the price of uranium had fallen , and the costs of nuclear power had risen , and the anti @-@ nuclear movement seemed to have won its case . The Campaign Against Nuclear Energy disbanded itself in 1988 , two years after the Chernobyl Disaster . 
 The government policy preventing new uranium mines continued into the 1990s , despite occasional reviews and debate . Following protest marches in Sydney , Melbourne and Brisbane during 1998 , a proposed mine at <unk> was blocked . 
 Also in 1998 , there was a proposal from an international consortium , Pangea Resources , to establish a nuclear waste dump in Western Australia . The plan , to store 20 per cent of the world 's spent nuclear fuel and weapons material , was " publicly condemned and abandoned " . 
 = = = 2000s = = = 
 In 2000 , the Ranger Uranium Mine in the Northern Territory and the Roxby Downs / Olympic Dam mine in South Australia continued to operate , but <unk> Uranium Mine had closed . A third uranium mine , Beverley Uranium Mine in SA , was also operating . Several advanced projects , such as Honeymoon in SA , <unk> in the Northern Territory and Yeelirrie in WA were on hold because of political and indigenous opposition . 
 In May 2000 there was an anti @-@ nuclear demonstration at the Beverley Uranium Mine , which involved about 100 protesters . Ten of the protesters were mistreated by police and were later awarded more than $ 700 @,@ 000 in damages from the South Australian government . 
 Following the McClelland Royal Commission , a large clean @-@ up was completed in outback South Australia in 2000 , after nuclear testing at Maralinga during the 1950s contaminated the region . The cleanup lasted three years , and cost over A $ 100 million , but there was controversy over the methods used and success of the operation . 
 As uranium prices began rising from about 2003 , proponents of nuclear power advocated it as a solution to global warming and the Australian government began taking an interest . However , in June 2005 , the Senate passed a motion opposing nuclear power for Australia . Then , in November 2006 , the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources released a pro @-@ nuclear report into Australia 's uranium . In late 2006 and early 2007 , then Prime Minister John Howard made widely reported statements in favour of nuclear power , on environmental grounds . 
 Faced with these proposals to examine nuclear power as a possible response to climate change , anti @-@ nuclear campaigners and scientists in Australia emphasised claims that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources , and that uranium mining itself could become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions . Anti @-@ nuclear campaigns were given added impetus by public concern about the sites for possible reactors : fears exploited by anti @-@ nuclear power political parties in the lead @-@ up to a national election in 2007 . 
 The Rudd Labor government elected in 2007 opposed nuclear power for Australia . The anti @-@ nuclear movement continues to be active in Australia , opposing expansion of existing uranium mines , lobbying against the development of nuclear power in Australia , and criticising proposals for nuclear waste disposal sites , the main candidate being Muckaty station in the Northern Territory . 
 By April 2009 , construction had begun on South Australia 's third uranium mine — the Honeymoon Uranium Mine . In October 2009 , the Australian government was continuing to plan for a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory . However , there was opposition from indigenous people , the NT government , and wider NT community . In November 2009 , about 100 anti @-@ nuclear protesters assembled outside the Alice Springs parliamentary sittings , urging the Northern Territory Government not to approve a nearby uranium mine site .

 As of 2010 , Australia has no nuclear power stations and the Gillard Labor government was opposed to nuclear power for Australia . Australia has three operating uranium mines at Olympic Dam ( Roxby ) and Beverley – both in South Australia 's north – and at Ranger in the Northern Territory . Australia has no nuclear weapons . Australia operates a research reactor which produces medical radioisotopes at <unk> . 
 As of early April 2010 , more than 200 environmentalists and indigenous people gathered in Tennant Creek to oppose a radioactive waste dump being built on Muckaty Station in the Northern Territory . 
 Western Australia has a significant share of the Australia 's uranium reserves , but between 2002 and 2008 , a statewide ban on uranium mining was in force . The ban was lifted when the Liberal Party was voted into power in the state and , as of 2010 , many companies are exploring for uranium in Western Australia . One of the industry 's major players , the mining company BHP Billiton , planned to develop the Yeelirrie uranium project in a 17 billion dollar project . Two other projects in Western Australia are further advanced then BHP 's Yeelirrie , these being the Lake Way uranium project , which is pursued by Toro Energy , and the Lake Maitland uranium project , pursued by Mega Uranium . But it is unlikely that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves . As of 2013 uranium prices are very low . 
 As of late 2010 , there are calls for Australians to debate whether the nation should adopt nuclear power as part of its energy mix . Nuclear power is seen to be " a divisive issue that can arouse deep passions among those for and against " . 
 Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear emergency in Japan , where three nuclear reactors were damaged by explosions , Ian Lowe sees the nuclear power option as being risky and unworkable for Australia . Lowe says nuclear power is too expensive , with insurmountable problems associated with waste disposal and weapons proliferation . It is also not a fast enough response to address climate change . Lowe advocates renewable energy which is " quicker , less expensive and less dangerous than nuclear " . 
 Nuclear reactors are banned in Queensland and Tasmania . Uranium mining was previously prohibited in New South Wales under the Uranium Prohibition Act of 1986 , however in 2012 Premier Barry O 'Farrell amended the legislation to allow prospecting and mining of uranium in that State . 
 In December 2011 , the sale of uranium to India was a contentious issue . MPs clashed over the issue and protesters were marched from Sydney 's convention centre before Prime Minister Julia Gillard 's motion to remove a party ban on uranium sales to India was narrowly supported 206 votes to 185 . Long @-@ time anti @-@ nuclear campaigner Peter Garrett MP spoke against the motion . 
 In March 2012 , hundreds of anti @-@ nuclear demonstrators converged on the Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto . The 500 @-@ strong march through southern Melbourne called for an end to uranium mining in Australia , and included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia 's Indigenous communities , who are concerned about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands . There were also events in Sydney . 
 A site within Muckaty Station is being considered for Australia 's low @-@ level and intermediate @-@ level radioactive waste storage and disposal facility . However , the plan is subject to a Federal Court challenge due to be heard early in 2013 . 
 More than 400 people joined a " Lizard 's Revenge march " to the Olympic Dam site in July 2012 . The anti @-@ nuclear activists , including Elder Kevin <unk> , protested against the mine expansion and the uranium industry . They say the company and the government have put short @-@ term economic gain ahead of environmental and health concerns . Organiser <unk> Calan said police harassed protesters , demanding identification and controlling access to and from their campsite . In August 2012 , BHP Billiton announced that the expansion was being postponed indefinitely pending investigation of a " new and cheaper design " . 
 Historically , many prospective Australian uranium mines have been constrained by active <unk> opposition , but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland . But it is unlikely that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves . As of 2013 uranium prices are very low . <unk> placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals ( <unk> , Angela / Pamela , <unk> , <unk> , and Valhalla / Skal ) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed . Toro wants to take the Wiluna proposal to the development phase , but has not been successful in attracting equity investors . When market prices go up again , so that mine development is justified , most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production . 
 As of 2013 , Prime Minister Abbott is a supporter of nuclear power , saying : " nuclear power is the only proven way of generating the base load power Australia needed without producing carbon pollution " . Abbott 's Coalition ’ s Resources and Energy policy says " the Coalition will formalise the agreement to sell uranium to India " . 
 In 2015 , South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill announced that a Royal Commission would be held to investigate the state 's role in the nuclear fuel cycle . South Australia is currently home to four of Australia 's five uranium mines , and the possibility of the state developing nuclear power generation , enrichment and waste storage facilities have previously proven to be contentious issues . The Royal Commission comes at a time of economic contraction for South Australia , which is suffering from job losses in mining and manufacturing sectors . Immediately following the announcement of the Royal Commission , emeritus Prof. Ian Lowe suggested that the current inquiry risks retreading old ground already covered by several previous public inquiries and proposals for nuclear industrialisation . Lowe referred to the 2006 <unk> review 's finding that substantial government subsidies would be required to support nuclear industrial development in Australia , and the 1976 @-@ 78 Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry ( Fox Report ) , which drew attention to the problems of nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear waste . On 17 April 2015 , Lowe was selected as one of five members of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission Expert Advisory Committee . 
 = = Issues = = 
 The case against nuclear power and uranium mining in Australia has been concerned with the environmental , political , economic , social and cultural impacts of nuclear energy ; with the shortcomings of nuclear power as an energy source ; and with presenting a sustainable energy strategy . The most prominent adverse impact of nuclear power is seen to be its potential contribution towards proliferation of nuclear weapons . For example , the 1976 Ranger Inquiry report stated that " The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war . This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry " . 
 The health risks associated with nuclear materials have also featured prominently in Australian anti @-@ nuclear campaigns . This has been the case worldwide because of accidents like the Chernobyl disaster , but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as controversy over the health effects of nuclear testing in Australia and the South Pacific , and the emergence of prominent anti @-@ nuclear campaigners Helen Caldicott and Tilman Ruff , who are medical practitioners . 
 The economics of nuclear power has been a factor in anti @-@ nuclear campaigns , with critics arguing that such power is uneconomical in Australia , particularly given the country 's abundance of coal resources . 
 According to the anti @-@ nuclear movement , most of the problems with nuclear power today are much the same as in the 1970s . Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing solution to the problem of long @-@ lived radioactive waste . Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur , notably in Pakistan and North Korea , building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations . The alternatives to nuclear power , efficient energy use and renewable energy ( especially wind power ) , have been further developed and commercialised . 
 = = Public opinion = = 
 A 2009 poll conducted by the Uranium Information Centre found that Australians in the 40 to 55 years age group are the " most <unk> opposed to nuclear power " . This generation was raised during the Cold War , experienced the anti @-@ nuclear movement of the 1970s , witnessed the 1979 partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island reactor in the USA , and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster . It was the generation which was also subject to cultural influences including feature films such as the " nuclear industry conspiracies " The China Syndrome and Silkwood and the apocalyptic Dr Strangelove . Younger people are " less resistant " to the idea of nuclear power in Australia . Analysis of opinion polls from 2012 shows a " significant decrease in favourable views of nuclear power " following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster . 
 Indigenous land owners have consistently opposed uranium mining and have spoken out about the adverse impact it has on their communities . The British nuclear tests at Maralinga were found to have left significant radiation hazards in land given back to the Maralinga Tjarutja people , and the issue continues to cause indigenous opposition .

 There are several prominent Australians who have publicly expressed anti @-@ nuclear views : 
 = Bye Bye Baby ( Madonna song ) = 
 " Bye Bye Baby " is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Madonna , for her fifth studio album Erotica ( 1992 ) . It was released on November 15 , 1993 , as the sixth and final single from the album . " Bye Bye Baby " was written by Madonna , Shep Pettibone , and Anthony Shimkin and was produced by Madonna and Pettibone . The song is inspired by Madonna 's emotions of that time and her S & M thoughts . Musically , it is a hip hop song , sampling a hook from LL Cool J 's track " Jingling Baby " , released in 1990 . Madonna 's vocals were filtered to make them appear as sound coming out from an antique radio . " Bye Bye Baby " features instrumentation from keyboard and lyrically finds Madonna asking questions to a lover she is about to abandon . 
 " Bye Bye Baby " received mixed reviews from music critics , who complimented the composition and lyrics , but were disappointed with Madonna 's vocal delivery . The song received limited release worldwide , peaking at number seven in Italy , and also charting in Australia , New Zealand and Switzerland . Madonna performed " Bye Bye Baby " on the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards and on her Girlie Show World Tour the same year . For both performances , she was dressed as a Victorian gentleman in tailcoat and top hat . She and her backup singers danced with three scantily clad women in a brothel @-@ style setting , while singing the song . Critics and authors noted the gender bending and role play in the performance , and found it to be a response to misogyny .

 After the completion of filming A League of Their Own , Madonna began working on her fifth studio album Erotica with Shep Pettibone . The singer was feeling miserable after a string of failed relationships , and she vented out the frustration and depression in her music . According to Lucy O 'Brien , author of Madonna : Like an Icon , there were no " sugar @-@ coated " songs on the album , most of which dealt with Madonna 's emotions . She appropriated a dominatrix persona called Dita , and the songwriting for the album , as well as the imagery in the coffee table book Sex , reflected her S & M thoughts . " Bye Bye Baby " was one such song written , dealing with strong emotions . 
 The release of " Bye Bye Baby " in Australia on November 15 , 1993 , coincided with Madonna 's Australian leg of her Girlie Show World Tour . The single release of the song was accompanied by remixes , which did not vary much from the album version . Some of them have additional beats and horn sounds thrown into the original mix . In his review of the single , Jose F. Promis from AllMusic expressed that the album version was the best , and the " Madonna 's Night on the Club " remix featured " swirling organs and guitar effects " set against an early @-@ 1990s house beat , making it the most interesting of the bunch . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 " Bye Bye Baby " was written by Madonna , Shep Pettibone and Anthony Shimkin and was produced by Madonna and Pettibone . The song was recorded at Sound Works Studios in Astoria , New York , and samples a hook from LL Cool J 's single , " Jingling Baby " ( 1990 ) . Pettibone also did the sequencing , the keyboard arrangement and the programming for the track with Shimkin . Dennis Mitchell and Robin Hancock were the recording engineers for the track while George Karras was the mixing engineer . Ted Jensen did the mastering for the song with Mark Goodman as assistant engineer . Background vocals were provided by Niki Haris and Donna DeLory . For " Bye Bye Baby " , Madonna and Pettibone wanted a 1940s theme , which would make the vocals sound as if they were coming out of an antique radio . In order to achieve that , they used a Pultec HLF filter . Shimkin recalled that the vocals for " Bye Bye Baby " were from the first take . He added that the filtered vocal effect were applied during recording and played with while Madonna was in front of the microphone singing . 
 " Bye Bye Baby " is a hip hop and dance song which begins with the declaration , " This is not a love song " . A low bass is heard against a high @-@ pitched 1960s keyboard sound . Madonna 's vocals were attenuated to sound much thinner with more treble . Guitar sounds are spread throughout occasionally with shouting voices being heard in the background . The song ends with the sound of an explosion . Madonna 's filtered voice sounds like an answering machine ; the final line , " You fucked it up " , is bleeped out like the machine 's end @-@ of @-@ message tone . According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Inc . , the song is set in the time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of F minor , with Madonna 's voice in a high register , spanning between F3 to A4 . The song has a basic sequence of G – B ♭ – G – D – G – Dm as its chord progression . 
 In the song , lyrically Madonna asks questions for a lover she is about to abandon : " Does it make you feel good to see me cry ? I think it does " , she affirms . The lyric " I 'd like to hurt you " was compared to that of Madonna 's previous single " Erotica " , where she said : " I only hurt the ones I love " . Richard Harrington from The Washington Post noted that Madonna used a " sonically filtered , detached and slightly taunting voice to talk about taking control rather than exacting revenge on a domineering , mind @-@ game @-@ playing partner " in the song . Regarding the lyrics , Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times called " Bye Bye Baby " a " <unk> song " . 
 = = Critical response = = 
 " Bye Bye Baby " received mostly mixed reviews from critics . Stephen Holden of The New York Times described it as " sly , spunky " . J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun praised " Bye Bye Baby " by saying : " It 's when [ Madonna ] and her co @-@ producers push beyond the expected – as with the dense , gimmicky groove of " Bye Bye Baby " [ ... ] the album really heats up , providing a sound that is body @-@ conscious in the best sense of the term . " David Browne from Entertainment Weekly wrote that Madonna was " honest " in the song . Louis Virtel of The Backlot included the song on his list of " The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs " , describing its composition as " a hip @-@ hop kiss @-@ off with cabaret flair . " Michael R. Smith from The Daily Vault found the track to be " defiant " and " in @-@ your @-@ face " . He realized that Madonna directed the lyrics to her past relationships with actor Warren Beatty and comedian Sandra Bernhard . 
 Arion Berger from Rolling Stone noticed the story line of Madonna " dumping " her lover in the song , but felt that her vocals were " infantile " and her delivery was " flat " . He added that her singing did not sound " assertive " and that " [ Madonna ] could be a drag queen toying with a pop hit of the past . " Rikky Rooksby , author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna , felt that the " aggressive " lyrics and the profanity at the end of the song , did not suit the erotic vibe of the album , " and strengthens the air of narcissism and calculation " . O 'Brien noticed Madonna 's vocals as cool and minimal , but sounding " flat " . She criticized the dance beat of the song for being " barely discernible " adding that Madonna sounds " like she is either not fully concentrating , or doesn 't have many resources to draw on – what alternative healers would call ' scattered chi ' , a depleted life force .

 " Bye Bye Baby " received limited release , being officially released in Australasia , Germany and Japan . However , it peaked at number seven on the Italian Singles Chart despite not being officially released as a single in that country . It became the fifth single from the Erotica album to place within the top 10 there . On November 25 , 1993 , " Bye Bye Baby " debuted at number 39 on the Swiss Hitparade chart , and after three weeks it rose to its peak of number 28 , before dropping off the chart . On December 5 , 1993 , the song debuted on the Australian Singles Chart at number 31 . The next week it peaked at number 15 on the chart . On February 6 , 1994 , after eight weeks , it fell off the chart . " Bye Bye Baby " entered the New Zealand charts at number 49 the chart week of November 25 , 1993 , but fell off the chart the following week . It re @-@ entered the chart week of January 23 , 1994 , ultimately peaking at number 43 .

 On September 2 , 1993 , Madonna opened the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards performing " Bye Bye Baby " . She cavorted on stage with three scantily clad women in a brothel @-@ style setting , dressed in tuxedos and top hats , in a choreographed , highly sexual routine . According to choreographer Alex Magno , he wanted to do " Justify My Love " or " The Beast Within " on MTV , but Madonna decided that they might be too controversial for live television and abandoned the idea . Nevertheless , " Bye Bye Baby " was chosen and performed with the choreography they had been practicing for The Girlie Show World Tour , since it represented the whole idea behind the tour . Louis Virtel from The Backlot ranked the performance at number eight on a list for " Madonna 's 11 Greatest VMA Moments " . He praised Madonna 's rendition of the song at the Video Music Awards , calling it " a hell of a VMA performance " and a " killer cinematic throwback " . 
 The performance of the song on the Girlie Show tour featured Madonna and her backup singers , DeLory and Haris , dressed as Victorian gentlemen in masculine outfits , including top hats and tailcoat . The whole ensemble was an homage to actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1930 American romance drama film Morocco , with the singer carrying a cane in her hands . The main inspiration behind this segment was 1900s showgirls and Japanese all @-@ female cross dressing dance company , Takarazuka Revue . Madonna transformed her voice into that of a circus ringmaster , introducing the arrival of three female strip @-@ club dancers . A voice @-@ alteration similar to the single was used in the performance . The dance routine revolved around three chairs . The female strippers seduced Madonna and the backup singers , by rubbing against them , holding sexual poses and dominated them , before they took control again . The performance on the November 19 , 1993 show at Sydney Cricket Ground was recorded and released on VHS and Laserdisc on April 26 , 1994 , as The Girlie Show : Live Down Under . 
 Brett <unk> noted in his book Queer Studies that Madonna was expanding on the characteristic butch and femme portrayal with the performance . He added that on a mere glance the performance might appear to be a " typical provoking one " from the singer , but underlying it was a " more complex queer perspective " . The butch roles are played by white and African @-@ American women , while the strippers were played by Asian @-@ American women . There are simulations of masturbation and sexual penetration in the performance , while the butch females control the femmes . <unk> concluded by saying that " the fact that Madonna chose Asian @-@ American women as the femmes reinforces stereotypes of Asian women as the passive , exotic , and feminine ' other ' . It also mocks the fact Asian women have been exploited as ' comfort girls ' for American servicemen , therefore , Madonna made a statement against male chauvinism , in her queer way . " For Gerry <unk> , author of Girl Making , the performances of both " Bye Bye Baby " and " Like a Virgin " on the tour emphasized the " blurring of gender and representation " .

 = Megalodon = 
 Megalodon ( / <unk> , <unk> / MEG @-@ ə @-@ lə @-@ don or / <unk> , <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ lə @-@ don , meaning " big tooth " , from Ancient Greek : μέγας ( megas ) " big , mighty " and <unk> ( <unk> ) , " tooth " — whose stem is <unk> , as seen in the genitive case form <unk> , <unk> ) is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 23 to 2 @.@ 6 million years ago , during the Cenozoic Era ( early Miocene to end of Pliocene ) . 
 The taxonomic assignment of C. megalodon has been debated for nearly a century , and is still under dispute . The two major interpretations are Carcharodon megalodon ( under family Lamnidae ) or Carcharocles megalodon ( under the family <unk> ) . Consequently , the scientific name of this species is commonly abbreviated C. megalodon in the literature . 
 Regarded as one of the largest and most powerful predators in vertebrate history , C. megalodon probably had a profound impact on the structure of marine communities . Fossil remains suggest that this giant shark reached a length of 18 metres ( 59 ft ) , and also indicate that it had a cosmopolitan distribution . Scientists suggest that C. megalodon looked like a stockier version of the great white shark , Carcharodon carcharias . 
 The tooth of C. megalodon is the state fossil of North Carolina .

 = = = <unk> = = = 
 According to Renaissance accounts , gigantic , triangular fossil teeth often found embedded in rocky formations were once believed to be the petrified tongues , or <unk> , of dragons and snakes . This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolaus Steno , who recognized them as shark teeth , and famously produced a depiction of a shark 's head bearing such teeth . He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected , which also contained an illustration of a C. megalodon tooth . 
 = = = Identification = = = 
 Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz gave the shark its initial scientific name , Carcharodon megalodon , in 1835 , in his research work Recherches sur les <unk> <unk> ( Research on fossil fish ) , which he completed in 1843 . C. megalodon teeth are morphologically similar to the teeth of the great white shark , and on the basis of this observation , Agassiz assigned C. megalodon to the genus Carcharodon . While the scientific name is C. megalodon , it is often informally dubbed the " megatooth shark " , " giant white shark " or " monster shark " . 
 = = Fossils = = 
 C. megalodon is represented in the fossil record primarily by teeth and vertebral centra . As with all sharks , C. megalodon 's skeleton was formed of cartilage rather than bone ; this means that most fossil specimens are poorly preserved . While the earliest C. megalodon remains were reported from late Oligocene strata , around 28 million years old , a more reliable date for the origin of the species is the early Miocene , about 23 million years ago . Although fossils are mostly absent in strata extending beyond the Tertiary boundary , they have been reported from subsequent Pleistocene strata . It is believed that C. megalodon became extinct around the end of the Pliocene , probably about 2 @.@ 6 million years ago ; reported post @-@ Pliocene C. megalodon teeth are thought to be reworked fossils . C. megalodon had a cosmopolitan distribution ; its fossils have been excavated from many parts of the world , including Europe , Africa and both North and South America , as well as Puerto Rico , Cuba , Jamaica , the Canary Islands , Australia , New Zealand , Japan , Malta , the Grenadines and India . C. megalodon teeth have been excavated from regions far away from continental lands , such as the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean . 
 The most common fossils of C. megalodon are its teeth . Diagnostic characteristics include : triangular shape , robust structure , large size , fine serrations , and visible V @-@ shaped neck . C. megalodon teeth can measure over 180 millimetres ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) in slant height or diagonal length , and are the largest of any known shark species . 
 Some fossil vertebrae have been found . The most notable example is a partially preserved vertebral column of a single specimen , excavated in the Antwerp basin , Belgium by M. <unk> in 1926 . It comprises 150 vertebral centra , with the centra ranging from 55 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) to 155 millimetres ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter . However , scientists have claimed that considerably larger vertebral centra can be expected . A partially preserved vertebral column of another C. megalodon specimen was excavated from Gram clay in Denmark by Bendix @-@ <unk> in 1983 . This specimen comprises 20 vertebral centra , with the centra ranging from 100 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) to 230 millimetres ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 Even after decades of research and scrutiny , controversy over C. megalodon phylogeny persists . Several shark researchers ( e.g. J. E. Randall , A. P. Klimley , D. G. Ainley , M. D. Gottfried , L. J. V. Compagno , S. C. Bowman , and R. W. Purdy ) insist that C. megalodon is a close relative of the great white shark . However , others ( e.g. D. S. Jordan , H. Hannibal , E. <unk> , C. <unk> , T. J. DeVries , D. Ward , and H. <unk> ) cite convergent evolution as the reason for the dental similarity . Such Carcharocles advocates have gained noticeable support . However , the original taxonomic assignment still has wide acceptance . 
 = = = C. megalodon within Carcharodon = = = 
 The traditional view is that C. megalodon should be classified within the genus Carcharodon along with the great white shark . The main reasons cited for this phylogeny are : ( 1 ) an ontogenetic gradation , whereby the teeth shift from coarse serrations as a juvenile to fine serrations as an adult , the latter resembling C. megalodon 's ; ( 2 ) morphological similarity of teeth of young C. megalodon to those of C. carcharias ; ( 3 ) a symmetrical second anterior tooth ; ( 4 ) a large intermediate tooth that is inclined mesially ; and ( 5 ) upper anterior teeth that have a chevron @-@ shaped neck area on the lingual surface . Carcharodon supporters suggest that C. megalodon and C. carcharias share a common ancestor , <unk> orientalis . 
 = = = C. megalodon within Carcharocles = = = 
 Around 1923 , the genus Carcharocles was proposed by D. S. Jordan and H. Hannibal , to classify the shark C. <unk> . Later on , Carcharocles proponents assigned C. megalodon to Carcharocles . Carcharocles proponents also suggest that the direct ancestor of the sharks belonging to Carcharocles is an ancient giant shark called Otodus obliquus , which lived during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs . According to Carcharocles supporters , Otodus obliquus evolved into Otodus <unk> , which evolved into Carcharocles <unk> , and then into Carcharocles angustidens , and then into Carcharocles chubutensis , and then into C. megalodon . Hence , the immediate ancestor of C. megalodon is C. chubutensis , because it serves as the missing link between C. <unk> and C. megalodon and it bridges the loss of the " lateral cusps " that characterize C. megalodon . 
 = = = = Reconsideration of megatooth lineage from Carcharocles to Otodus = = = = 
 Shark researchers are apparently reconsidering the genus of the entire Carcharocles lineage back to Otodus . 
 = = = = Megalodon as a chronospecies = = = = 
 Shark researcher David Ward elaborated on the evolution of Carcharocles by implying that this lineage , stretching from the Paleocene to the Pliocene , is of a single giant shark which gradually changed through time , suggesting a case of chronospecies . This assessment may be credible . 
 = = = = Mako sharks as closest relatives of great white sharks = = = = 
 Carcharocles proponents point out that the great white shark is closely related to the ancient shark Isurus hastalis , the " broad tooth mako " , rather than to C. megalodon . One reason cited by paleontologist Chuck <unk> is that the dental morphometrics ( variations and changes in the physical form of objects ) of I. hastalis and C. carcharias are remarkably similar . Another reason cited is that C. megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than C. carcharias teeth . Further evidence linking the great white shark more closely to ancient mako sharks , rather than to C. megalodon , was provided in 2009 – the fossilized remains of a form of the great white shark about 4 million years old were excavated from southwestern Peru in 1988 . These remains demonstrate a likely shared ancestor of modern mako and great white sharks . 
 = = = Considerations = = = 
 <unk> asserted that dental similarities between C. megalodon and the great white are superficial with noticeable morphometric differences between them , and that these findings are sufficient to warrant a separate genus . However , some Carcharodon proponents ( i.e. , M. D. Gottfried , and R. E. Fordyce ) provided more arguments for a close relationship between the megatooth and the great white . With respect to the recent controversy regarding fossil <unk> shark relationships , overall morphology – particularly the internal calcification patterns – of the great white shark vertebral centra have been compared to well @-@ preserved fossil centra from the megatooth , including C. megalodon and C. angustidens . The morphological similarity of these comparisons supports a close relationship of the giant fossil megatooth species to extant whites . 
 Gottfried and Fordyce pointed out that some great white shark fossils are about 16 million years old and predate the transitional Pliocene fossils . In addition , the Oligocene C. megalodon records contradict the suggestion that C. chubutensis is the immediate ancestor of C. megalodon . These records also indicate that C. megalodon co @-@ existed with C. angustidens . 
 Some paleontologists argue that the genus Otodus should be used for sharks within the Carcharocles lineage and that the genus Carcharocles should be discarded . 
 Several Carcharocles proponents ( i.e. C. Pimiento , D. J. Ehret , B. J. MacFadden , and G. Hubbell ) claim that both species belong to the order Lamniformes , and in the absence of living members of the family <unk> , the great white shark is the species most ecologically analogous to C. megalodon . 
 = = Anatomy = = 
 Among extant species , the great white shark is regarded as the best analogue to C. megalodon . The lack of well @-@ preserved fossil C. megalodon skeletons led scientists to rely on the great white shark as the basis of its reconstruction and size estimation . 
 = = = Size estimation = = = 
 Due to fragmentary remains , estimating the size of C. megalodon has been challenging . However , the scientific community has concluded that C. megalodon was larger than the whale shark , Rhincodon typus . Scientists focused on two aspects of size : total length and body mass . 
 = = = = Length = = = = 
 The first attempt to reconstruct the jaw of C. megalodon was made by Bashford Dean in 1909 . From the dimensions of this jaw reconstruction , it was hypothesized that C. megalodon could have approached 30 metres ( 98 ft ) . Better knowledge of dentition and more accurate muscle structures , led to a rectified version of Dean 's jaw model about 70 percent of its original size and to a size consistent with modern findings . To resolve such errors , scientists , aided by new fossil discoveries of C. megalodon and improved knowledge of its closest living analogue 's anatomy , introduced more quantitative methods for estimating its size based on the statistical relationships between the tooth sizes and body lengths . Some methods are mentioned below . 
 = = = = = Enamel height = = = = = 
 In 1973 , Hawaiian ichthyologist John E. Randall used a plotted graph to demonstrate a relationship between the enamel height ( the vertical distance of the blade from the base of the enamel portion of the tooth to its tip ) of the largest tooth in the upper jaw of the great white shark and the shark 's total length . Randall extrapolated this method to estimate C. megalodon 's total length . Randall cited two C. megalodon teeth in his work , specimen number <unk> at the American Museum of Natural History and specimen number <unk> at the United States National Museum , which had enamel heights of 115 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) and 117 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 63 in ) , respectively . These teeth yielded a corresponding total length of about 13 metres ( 43 ft ) . In 1991 , Richard Ellis and John E. McCosker claimed that tooth enamel height does not necessarily increase in proportion to the animal 's total length .

 In 1996 , after scrutinizing 73 great white shark specimens , Michael D. Gottfried , Leonard Compagno and S. Curtis Bowman proposed a linear relationship between the shark 's total length and the height of the largest upper anterior tooth . The proposed relationship is : total length in metres = − ( 0 @.@ 096 ) × [ UA maximum height ( mm ) ] - ( 0 @.@ 22 ) . Gottfried and colleagues then extrapolated their technique to C. megalodon . The biggest C. megalodon tooth in the possession of this team , one discovered by Compagno in 1993 , was an upper second anterior specimen , the maximum height of which was 168 millimetres ( 6 @.@ 6 in ) . It yielded an estimated total length for C. megalodon of 15 @.@ 9 metres ( 52 ft ) . Rumors of larger C. megalodon teeth persisted at the time . The maximum tooth height for this method is measured as a vertical line from the tip of the crown to the bottom of the lobes of the root , parallel to the long axis of the tooth . In layman 's terms , the maximum height of the tooth is its slant height . 
 = = = = = Root width = = = = = 
 In 2002 , shark researcher Clifford Jeremiah proposed that total length was proportional to the root width of an upper anterior tooth . He claimed that for every 1 centimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) of root width , there are approximately 1 @.@ 4 metres ( 4 @.@ 6 ft ) of shark length . Jeremiah pointed out that the jaw perimeter of a shark is directly proportional to its total length , with the width of the roots of the largest teeth being a tool for estimating jaw perimeter . The largest tooth in Jeremiah 's possession had a root width of about 12 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) , which yielded 16 @.@ 5 metres ( 54 ft ) in total length . Ward asserted that this method is based on a sound principle that works well with most large sharks . 
 = = = = = Crown height = = = = = 
 In 2002 , paleontologist <unk> Shimada of DePaul University proposed a linear relationship between tooth crown height and total length in great white sharks after conducting anatomical analysis of several specimens . This relationship is expressed as : total length in centimetres = a + bx , where a is a constant , b is the slope of the line and x is the crown height of tooth in millimetres . This relationship allowed any tooth to be used for the estimate . The crown height was measured as maximum vertical <unk> height on the labial side . Shimada pointed out that previously proposed methods were based on weaker evaluation of dental homology , and that the growth rate between the crown and root is not isometric , which he considered in his model . Furthermore , this relationship could be used to predict the total length of sharks that are morphologically similar to the great white shark , such as C. megalodon . Using this model , the upper anterior tooth ( with maximum height of 168 millimetres ( 6 @.@ 6 in ) ) possessed by Gottfried and colleagues corresponded to a total length of 15 @.@ 1 metres ( 50 ft ) . In 2010 , shark researchers Catalina Pimiento , Dana J. Ehret , Bruce J. MacFadden and Gordon Hubbell estimated the total length of C. megalodon on the basis of Shimada 's method . Among the specimens found in the Gatun Formation of Panama , specimen number <unk> yielded a total length of 16 @.@ 8 metres ( 55 ft ) . Later on , shark researchers ( including Pimiento , Ehret and MacFadden ) revisited the Gatun Formation and recovered additional specimens . Specimen number <unk> yielded a total length of 17 @.@ 9 metres ( 59 ft ) on the basis of Shimada 's method . 
 = = = = = Consensus = = = = = 
 In the 1990s , marine biologists such as Patrick J. Schembri and <unk> <unk> opined that C. megalodon may have approached a maximum of around 24 to 25 metres ( 79 to 82 ft ) in total length ; however , Gottfried and colleagues asserted that C. megalodon could have reached a maximum of 20 @.@ 3 metres ( 67 ft ) in total length . However , a commonly acknowledged maximum total length of C. megalodon is 18 metres ( 59 ft ) . 
 = = = = = Largest known specimens = = = = = 
 Gordon Hubbell from Gainesville , Florida , possesses an upper anterior C. megalodon tooth whose maximum height is 184 @.@ 1 millimetres ( 7 @.@ 25 in ) . In addition , a C. megalodon jaw reconstruction contains a tooth whose maximum height is reportedly 193 @.@ 67 millimetres ( 7 @.@ 625 in ) . This jaw reconstruction was developed by fossil hunter Vito Bertucci , who was known as " Megalodon Man " . 
 = = = = Body mass estimates = = = = 
 Gottfried and colleagues introduced a method to determine the mass of the great white after studying the length – mass relationship data of 175 specimens at various growth stages and extrapolated it to estimate C. megalodon 's mass . According to their model , a 15 @.@ 9 metres ( 52 ft ) long C. megalodon would have a mass of about 48 metric tons ( 53 short tons ) , a 17 metres ( 56 ft ) long C. megalodon would have a mass of about 59 metric tons ( 65 short tons ) , and a 20 @.@ 3 metres ( 67 ft ) long C. megalodon would have a mass of 103 metric tons ( 114 short tons ) . 
 = = = Dentition and jaw mechanics = = = 
 A team of Japanese scientists , T. <unk> , O. Sakamoto , and H. Sekine , discovered and excavated partial remains of a C. megalodon , with its nearly complete associated set of teeth , from Saitama , Japan , in 1989 . Another nearly complete associated C. megalodon dentition was excavated from the Yorktown Formations of Lee Creek , Aurora , North Carolina , in the United States and served as the basis of a jaw reconstruction of C. megalodon at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City . These associated tooth sets solved the mystery of how many teeth would be in each row of the jaws of C. megalodon . As a result , highly accurate jaw reconstructions became possible . More associated C. megalodon dentitions were found in later years . Based on these discoveries , scientists S. Applegate and L. Espinosa published an artificial dental formula ( representation of dentition of an animal with respect to types of teeth and their arrangement within the animal 's jaw ) for C. megalodon in 1996 . Most accurate modern C. megalodon jaw reconstructions are based on this dental formula . 
 The dental formula of C. megalodon is : 2 @.@ 1 @.@ 7 @.@ 43 @.@ 0 @.@ 8 @.@ 4 . 
 As evident from the formula , C. megalodon had four kinds of teeth in its jaws . 
 Anterior - A 
 Intermediate - I ( C. megalodon 's tooth technically appears to be an upper anterior and is termed as " A3 " because it is fairly symmetrical and does not point mesially ( side of the tooth toward the midline of the jaws where the left and right jaws meet ) , but this tooth is still designated as an intermediate tooth . However , the great white shark 's intermediate tooth does point mesially . This point was raised in the Carcharodon vs. Carcharocles debate regarding the megalodon and favors the case of Carcharocles proponents . ) 
 Lateral - L 
 Posterior - P 
 C. megalodon had a very robust dentition , and had a total of about 276 teeth in its jaws , spanning 5 rows . Paleontologists suggest that a very large C. megalodon had jaws over 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) across . 
 = = = = Bite force = = = = 
 In 2008 , a team of scientists led by S. Wroe conducted an experiment to determine the bite force of the great white shark , using a 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) long specimen , and then isometrically scaling the results for its maximum confirmed size and the conservative minimum and maximum body mass of C. megalodon , placing the bite force of the latter between 108 @,@ 514 N ( 24 @,@ 400 lbf ) and 182 @,@ 201 N ( 41 @,@ 000 lbf ) in a posterior bite . Compared to 18 @,@ 216 N ( 4 @,@ 095 lbf ) for the largest confirmed great white shark , and 5 @,@ 300 N ( 1 @,@ 200 lbf ) for the <unk> fish <unk> . 
 In addition , Wroe and colleagues pointed out that sharks shake sideways while feeding , amplifying the post @-@ cranial generated forces . Therefore , the total force experienced by prey is probably higher than the estimate . The extraordinary bite forces in C. megalodon must be considered in the context of its great size and of paleontological evidence suggesting that C. megalodon was an active predator of large whales . 
 = = = = Functional parameters of teeth = = = = 
 The teeth of C. megalodon were exceptionally robust and serrated , which would have improved efficiency in slicing its prey 's flesh . Paleontologist B. K. Kent suggested that these teeth are comparatively thicker for their size with much lower slenderness and bending strength ratios . Their roots are substantially larger relative to total tooth heights , and so have a greater mechanical advantage . Teeth with these traits are good cutting tools and are well suited for grasping powerful prey and would seldom crack even when slicing through bones . 
 = = = Skeletal anatomy = = = 
 Gottfried and colleagues further estimated the schematics of C. megalodon 's entire skeleton . To support the beast 's dentition , its jaws would have been massive , stouter , and more strongly developed than those of the great white , which possesses a comparatively gracile dentition . The jaws would have given it a " pig @-@ eyed " profile . Its <unk> would have had a <unk> and more robust appearance than that of the great white . Its fins were proportional to its larger size . Scrutiny of the partially preserved vertebral C. megalodon specimen from Belgium revealed that C. megalodon had a higher vertebral count than specimens of any known shark . Only the great white approached it . 
 Using the above characteristics , Gottfried and colleagues reconstructed the entire skeleton of C. megalodon , which was later put on display at the Calvert Marine Museum at Solomon 's Island , Maryland , in the United States . This reconstruction is 11 @.@ 5 metres ( 38 ft ) long and represents a young individual . The team stresses that relative and proportional changes in the skeletal features of C. megalodon are ontogenetic in nature in comparison to those of the great white , as they occur in great white sharks while growing . Fossil remains of C. megalodon confirm that it had a heavily calcified skeleton while alive . 
 = = <unk> and <unk> considerations = = 
 = = = Range and habitat = = = 
 Sharks , especially large species , are highly mobile and experience a complex life history amid wide distribution . Fossil records indicate that C. megalodon was cosmopolitan , and commonly occurred in subtropical to temperate latitudes . It has been found at latitudes up to 55 ° N ; its inferred tolerated temperature range goes down to an annual mean of 12 ° C ( an annual range of 1 – 24 ° C ) . It arguably had the capacity to endure such low temperatures by virtue of <unk> , the physiological capability of large sharks to conserve metabolic heat by maintaining a higher body temperature than the surrounding water . 
 C. megalodon had enough adaptability to inhabit a wide range of marine environments ( i.e. , shallow coastal waters , areas of coastal upwelling , swampy coastal lagoons , sandy <unk> , and offshore deep water environments ) , and exhibited a transient lifestyle . Adult C. megalodon were not abundant in shallow water environments , and mostly lurked offshore . C. megalodon may have moved between coastal and oceanic waters , particularly in different stages of its life cycle . 
 Fossil remains show a trend for specimens to be larger in the southern hemisphere than in the northern ( mean lengths of 11 @.@ 6 vs 9 @.@ 6 m , respectively ) and in the Pacific relative to the Atlantic ( 10 @.@ 9 vs. 9 @.@ 5 m ) . They do not , however , suggest any trend of changing body size with absolute latitude , or of change in size over time ( although the megatooth lineage in general is thought to display a trend of increasing size over time ) . The overall modal length has been estimated at 10 @.@ 5 m , with the length distribution skewed towards larger individuals , suggesting an ecological or competitive advantage for larger body size . 
 = = = Prey relationships = = = 
 Sharks generally are opportunistic predators , but scientists propose that C. megalodon was " arguably the most formidable carnivore ever to have existed " . Its great size , high @-@ speed swimming capability , and powerful jaws , coupled with a formidable killing apparatus , made it a super @-@ predator capable of consuming a broad spectrum of fauna . A study about calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranchs revealed that C. megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark . 
 Fossil evidence indicates that C. megalodon preyed upon cetaceans ( i.e. , dolphins ) , small whales , ( including cetotheriids , squalodontids , and <unk> ) , and large whales , ( including sperm whales , bowhead whales , and rorquals ) , pinnipeds , porpoises , sirenians , and giant sea turtles . Marine mammals were regular prey targets for C. megalodon . Many whale bones have been found with clear signs of large bite marks ( deep gashes ) made by teeth that match the teeth of C. megalodon . Various excavations have revealed C. megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales , and sometimes in direct association with them . Fossil evidence of interactions between C. megalodon and pinnipeds also exist . In one interesting observation , a 127 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) C. megalodon tooth was found lying very close to a bitten <unk> of a sea lion . 
 = = = Competition and impact on marine communities = = = 
 C. megalodon faced a highly competitive environment . However , its position at the top of the food chain probably had a profound impact on the structuring of marine communities . Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between C. megalodon emergence and extensive diversification of cetaceans . Juvenile C. megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant , and adult C. megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant . Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene . 
 C. megalodon were contemporaneous with macro @-@ predatory odontocetes ( particularly raptorial sperm whales and squalodontids ) , which were also probably among the era 's apex predators , and provided competition . In response to competition from giant macro @-@ predatory sharks , macro @-@ predatory odontocetes may have evolved defensive adaptations ; some species became pack predators , and some attained gigantic sizes , such as <unk> <unk> . By late Miocene , raptorial sperm whales experienced a significant decline in abundance and diversity . However , raptorial delphinids began to emerge during the Pliocene , to fill this ecological void . 
 Like other sharks , C. megalodon also would have been piscivorous . Fossil evidence indicates that other notable species of macro @-@ predatory sharks ( e.g. , great white sharks ) responded to competitive pressure from C. megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited . C. megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism . 
 = = = Feeding strategies = = = 
 Sharks often employ complex hunting strategies to engage large prey animals . Some paleontologists suggest that great white shark hunting strategies may offer clues as to how C. megalodon hunted its unusually large prey . However , fossil evidence suggests that C. megalodon employed even more effective hunting strategies against large prey than the great white shark . 
 Paleontologists surveyed fossils to determine attacking patterns . One particular specimen – the remains of a 9 metres ( 30 ft ) long prehistoric baleen whale ( of an unknown Miocene taxon ) – provided the first opportunity to quantitatively analyze its attack behavior . The predator primarily focused on the tough bony portions ( i.e. , shoulders , flippers , rib cage , and upper spine ) of the prey , which great white sharks generally avoid . Dr. B. Kent elaborated that C. megalodon attempted to crush the bones and damage delicate organs ( i.e. , heart and lungs ) harbored within the rib cage . Such an attack would have immobilized the prey , which would have died quickly from injuries to these vital organs . These findings also clarify why the ancient shark needed more robust dentition than that of the great white shark . Furthermore , attack patterns could differ for prey of different sizes . Fossil remains of some small cetaceans ( e.g. cetotheriids ) suggest that they were rammed with great force from below before being killed and eaten . 
 During the Pliocene , larger and more advanced cetaceans appeared . C. megalodon apparently further refined its hunting strategies to cope with these large whales . Numerous fossilized flipper bones ( i.e. , segments of the pectoral fins ) and caudal vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with C. megalodon bite marks . This paleontological evidence suggests that C. megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting off its locomotive structures before killing and feeding on it . 
 = = = Nursery areas = = = 
 Fossil evidence suggests that the preferred nursery sites of C. megalodon were warm water coastal environments , where threats were minor and food plentiful . Nursery sites were identified in the Gatun Formation of Panama , the Calvert Formation of Maryland , Banco de Concepción in the Canary Islands , and the Bone Valley Formation of Florida . As is the case with most sharks , C. megalodon gave birth to live young . The size of neonate C. megalodon teeth indicate that pups were around 2 to 4 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 to 13 @.@ 1 ft ) in total length at birth . Their dietary preferences display an ontogenetic shift . Young C. megalodon commonly preyed on fish , giant sea turtles , dugongs and small cetaceans ; mature C. megalodon moved to off @-@ shore cetacean high @-@ use areas and consumed large cetaceans . 
 However , an exceptional case in the fossil record suggests that juvenile C. megalodon may occasionally have attacked much larger <unk> whales . Three tooth marks apparently from a 4 – 7 @-@ metre ( 13 @.@ 1 – 23 @.@ 0 ft ) long Pliocene macro @-@ predatory shark were found on a rib from an ancestral great blue or humpback whale that showed evidence of subsequent healing . Scientists suspect that this shark was a juvenile C. megalodon . 
 = = Extinction = = 
 The subject of C. megalodon ’ s extinction remains under investigation . Several possible causes for its decline and eventual disappearance have been proposed . 
 = = = Environmental factors = = = 
 = = = = Oceanic cooling and sea level drops = = = = 
 The Earth has been in a long term cooling trend since the Miocene Climactic Optimum , 15 – 17 Ma ago . This trend may have been accelerated by changes in global ocean circulation caused by the closure of the Central American Seaway and / or other factors ( see Pliocene climate ) , setting the stage for glaciation in the northern hemisphere . Consequently , during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene , there were ice ages , which cooled the oceans significantly . Expansion of glaciation during the Pliocene tied up huge volumes of water in continental ice sheets , resulting in significant sea level drops . It has been argued that this cooling trend adversely impacted C. megalodon , as it preferred warmer waters , causing it to decline in abundance until its ultimate extinction at the end of the Pliocene . Fossil evidence confirms the absence of C. megalodon in regions around the world where water temperatures had significantly declined during the Pliocene . Furthermore , these oceanographic changes may have restricted many of the suitable warm water nursery sites for C. megalodon , hindering reproduction . Nursery areas are pivotal for the survival of many shark species , in part because they protect juveniles from predation . 
 = = = Biotic factors = = = 
 = = = = Decline in food supply = = = = 
 Baleen whales attained their greatest diversity during the Miocene , with over 20 recognized genera in comparison to only six extant genera . Such diversity presented an ideal setting to support a gigantic <unk> such as C. megalodon . However , by the end of the Miocene many species of mysticetes had gone extinct ; surviving species may have been faster swimmers and thus more elusive prey . Furthermore , after the closure of the Central American Seaway , additional extinctions occurred in the marine environment , and faunal redistribution took place ; tropical great whales decreased in diversity and abundance . Whale migratory patterns during the Pliocene have been reconstructed from the fossil record , suggesting that most surviving species of whales showed a trend towards polar regions . The cooling of the oceans during the Pliocene might have restricted the access of C. megalodon to polar regions , depriving it of its main food source of large whales . As a result of these developments , the food supply for C. megalodon in regions it inhabited during the Pliocene , primarily in low @-@ to @-@ mid latitudes , was no longer sufficient to sustain it worldwide . C. megalodon was adapted to a specialized lifestyle , and this lifestyle was disturbed by these developments . Paleontologist Albert Sanders suggests that C. megalodon was too large to sustain itself on the declining tropical food supply . The resulting shortage of food sources in the tropics during Plio @-@ Pleistocene times may have fueled cannibalism by C. megalodon . Juveniles were at increased risk from attacks by adults during times of starvation . 
 = = = = Competitive pressures = = = = 
 Large raptorial delphinids ( members of genus Orcinus ) evolved during the Pliocene , and probably filled the ecological void left by the disappearance of raptorial sperm whales at the end of the Miocene . A minority view is that competition from ancestral killer whales may have contributed to the shark 's decline ( another source suggests more generally that " competition with large odontocetes " may have been a factor ) . Fossil records indicate that these delphinids commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene , indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures . They also occurred in the tropics ( e.g. , Orcinus sp. in South Africa ) . 
 = = = Multiple causes = = = 
 Expert consensus has pointed to factors such as a cooling trend in the oceans and a shortage of food sources during Plio @-@ Pleistocene times having played a significant role in the demise of C. megalodon . 
 However , a recent analysis of the distribution , abundance and climatic range of C. megalodon over geologic time suggests that biotic factors , i.e. dwindling numbers of prey species combined with competition from new macro @-@ predators ( raptorial sperm whales , great white sharks and killer whales ) , were the primary drivers of its extinction . The distribution of C. megalodon during the Miocene and Pliocene did not correlate with warming and cooling trends ; while the abundance and distribution of C. megalodon declined during the Pliocene , C. megalodon did show a capacity to inhabit anti @-@ tropical latitudes . C. megalodon was found in locations with a mean temperature ranging from 12 to 27 ° C ( with a total range of from 1 to 33 ° C ) , indicating that the global extent of suitable habitat for C. megalodon should not have been greatly affected by the temperature changes that occurred . 
 The extinction of C. megalodon set the stage for further changes in marine communities . Average body size of baleen whales increased significantly after its disappearance . Other apex predators gained from the loss of this formidable species , in some cases spreading to regions where C. megalodon became absent . 
 = = In fiction = = 
 C. megalodon has been portrayed in several works of fiction , including films and novels , and continues to hold its place among the most popular subjects for fiction involving sea monsters . Many of these works posit that at least a relict population of C. megalodon survived extinction and lurk in the vast depths of the ocean , and that individuals may manage to surface , either by human intervention or by natural means . Jim Shepard 's story " Tedford and the Megalodon " is an example of this . Such beliefs are usually inspired by the discovery of a C. megalodon tooth by members of HMS Challenger in 1872 , which some believed to be only 10 @,@ 000 years old . 
 Some works of fiction ( such as Shark Attack 3 : Megalodon and Steve Alten 's Meg series ) incorrectly depict C. megalodon as being a species over 70 million years old , and to have lived during the time of the dinosaurs . The writers of the movie Shark Attack 3 : Megalodon depicted this assumption by including an altered copy of Great White Shark by shark researcher Richard Ellis . The copy shown in the film had several pages that do not exist in the book . The author sued the film 's distributor , Lions Gate Entertainment , asking for a halt to the film 's distribution along with $ 150 @,@ 000 in damages . Steve Alten 's Meg : A Novel of Deep Terror is probably best known for portraying this inaccuracy with its prologue and cover artwork depicting C. megalodon killing a tyrannosaur in the sea . 
 The Animal Planet fictional documentary , Mermaids : The Body Found , included an encounter 1 @.@ 6 million years ago between a pod of mermaids and a C. megalodon . Later , in August 2013 , the Discovery Channel opened its annual Shark Week series with another film for television Megalodon : The Monster Shark Lives , a controversial docufiction about the creature that presented alleged evidence in order to suggest that C. megalodon was still alive . This program received criticism for being completely fictional ; for example , all of the supposed " scientists " depicted were paid actors . In 2014 Discovery re @-@ aired " The Monster Shark Lives " , along with a new one @-@ hour program , " Megalodon : The New Evidence " , and an additional fictionalized program entitled " Shark of Darkness : Wrath of Submarine " , resulting in further backlash from media sources and the scientific community .

 The 1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season was the team 's fourth in the National Football League . After having won just seven games in the previous three seasons combined , the 1979 Buccaneers won ten games making this their first winning season . They finished as NFC Central division champions , and won the first playoff game in franchise history . 
 The Buccaneers added offensive threats to complement their solid defense ; a healthy Doug Williams played his first full season and Ricky Bell became the team 's first 1 @,@ 000 @-@ yard back , rushing for a career @-@ high 1 @,@ 263 yards . 
 The 1979 team not only posted their first winning record , but earned a playoff spot by winning the NFC Central division title . The playoff spot was secured in the final week in a rain @-@ sodden game against the Kansas City Chiefs , with the only score being a 19 @-@ yard field goal by Neil O 'Donoghue . They then recorded their first @-@ ever playoff win by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles behind Bell 's 142 yards rushing .

 The Buccaneers doubled the size of their scouting staff from two to four , hoping to get more mileage out of the later rounds of the draft . Greg Roberts was the 1978 Outland Trophy winner , and blocked for 1978 Heisman Trophy winner Billy Sims . The Buccaneers had him rated as the best lineman in the draft , and expected him to have been selected long before the second round , where the Buccaneers had their highest selection . He is believed to have fallen to the second round due to an inability to pass @-@ block , having played at the run @-@ heavy University of Oklahoma . This resulted in a poor performance at the Senior Bowl . Gordon Jones , with a 4 @.@ 59 time in the 40 @-@ yard dash , drew pre @-@ draft comparisons to Lynn Swann , but dropped to the second round due to concerns over his speed . He was the third receiver selected overall . Roberts and Jones both left the Buccaneers after four seasons . Jerry Eckwood and Rick Berns were selected to address injury problems at running back . Eckwood had been second in the nation in rushing ( behind Ricky Bell ) before being injured in 1975 . Berns was at the time the leading rusher in Nebraska history . Eckwood and Berns impressed McKay enough in mini @-@ camp that he traded Louis Carter away . Gene Sanders played for several seasons , after successfully converting to offensive tackle .

 Dave Pear , the Buccaneers ' first Pro Bowl selection and most popular player , was traded to the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks .

 The Buccaneers surprised the NFL by reeling off wins in their first five games , an accomplishment that left them as the season 's last undefeated team and landed them on the cover of Sports Illustrated . It also put them in first place for good in the NFC Central . The team 's youth became an issue later on , as they went into a late @-@ season losing streak on the verge of earning their first playoff spot . It was felt that more veteran leadership would have helped the team during the stretch run . Linebacker Dave Lewis publicly stated that the team was " choking " , while Selmon compared the difficulty of getting the playoff @-@ clinching win to the difficulty of getting the expansion team 's first win . After dropping three games in a row , of which winning any of the three would have clinched the division , McKay launched into an obscenity @-@ laced tirade against reporters who called the team a " laughingstock " and " <unk> " . Even against a schedule that featured only two opponents with winning records it took until the final game of the season for the Buccaneers to win their tenth game . A better conference record gave the Buccaneers the division win over the also @-@ 10 @-@ 6 Chicago Bears . Of all NFC Central teams other than the Vikings , the Buccaneers became only the second to win the division since 1970 , and the only one to advance in the playoffs . The Buccaneers were considered by many to be an unworthy division champion , even called " cheesecake champions " by opponents , until they advanced to the NFC Championship with a 24 – 17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles . There , with several key players injured , they held the Los Angeles Rams to nine points , but were held scoreless on offense to end their season one game short of the Super Bowl .
