It has an outdoor education campus at Yarra Junction , and a student centre in Nanjing , China where the Year 9 internationalism programme is conducted . Caulfield is the only Melbourne @-@ based APS school to provide boarding for both boys and girls , with 95 boarding students , and is the second largest school in Victoria , currently catering for approximately 3 @,@ 000 students . 
 = = History = = 
 Joseph Henry Davies , who had served as a missionary in southern India , purchased the site for the school — it was adjacent to the Elsternwick railway station , and had been a small <unk> shop — for £ 25 on 16 April and employed his sister and two brothers as teachers . Davies ' aim was " that the School should be a thoroughly Christian one " that looked to render " Christian service " . 
 Although the school was originally located in Elsternwick , it is thought to have been named Caulfield Grammar School because Caulfield was the regional locality — and the geographical boundaries of Melbourne 's suburban areas were not strictly defined or precisely named at the time — also , it is significant that the vicar of St Mary 's Anglican Church in Caulfield had provided Davies with support when opening the school . Davies had gone to India under the auspices of St Mary 's , having been a member of the church for several years before that . 
 Caulfield Grammar School was founded on 25 April 1881 , by Davies , with just nine pupils . Davies ' original intention was to commence classes on Wednesday , 20 April 1881 ; however , due to circumstances that were never clearly explained , Davies postponed the school 's opening , at the last minute , until Monday , 25 April 1881 . 
 Davies later went to Korea as a missionary under the auspices of the Victorian Presbyterian church , having been ordained as Presbyterian minister at Scots ' Church , Melbourne on 5 August 1889 ; he had broken from the Church of England and , through this act , also broken from the Church Missionary Society . 
 A year after opening , the school had 32 students enrolled . To house the growing student body , the school then moved to a nearby small building nearby , destroyed in a fire in 1890 . In 1896 , the school subsumed Hawksburn Grammar School , a smaller local Christian school , situated in <unk> Road , Prahran , after Hawksburn 's headmaster , Walter Murray <unk> , was appointed as headmaster at Caulfield . Hawksburn 's 55 students subsequently transferred to Caulfield . The current site , a property near Sir Frederick <unk> 's Rippon Lea Estate on what is now Glen <unk> Road , St Kilda East was purchased in 1909 . Classes began on the site on 9 February 1909 and the school 's boarding house opened in 1912 . 
 By 1931 , the school 's 50th anniversary , attendance had grown to 500 students but Caulfield was still considered small compared to schools such as Scotch College , Melbourne , Wesley College Melbourne and Melbourne Grammar School . To celebrate the Golden Jubilee , a Jubilee Fair was held at the school in May . In the same year , the school moved from private ownership to a registered company governed by a School Council , an organisational structure still used today , with formal affiliation with the Church of England . In 1958 Caulfield joined the exclusive Associated Public Schools of Victoria schoolboy sporting competition . Caulfield was Victoria 's fifth largest school in 1959 , with over 800 students . 
 In 1961 , Caulfield affiliated with Malvern Memorial Grammar School . Malvern Grammar School opened in 1890 as a boys @-@ only secondary school and in 1924 moved into the Valentine 's Mansion , formerly the home of Sir John Mark Davies ( no relation to the school 's founder ) , a Victorian Cabinet minister . The mansion was built in 1892 and contains a large ballroom . Valentine 's Mansion has been listed as a place of historical and architecture significance by both the Victorian Heritage Register and the Register of the National Estate . 
 The school was renamed Malvern Memorial Grammar School in 1947 to honour old boys who had fought in World Wars I and II . Malvern Memorial Grammar School amalgamated with Shaw House in 1971 and became the Malvern Campus , a primary school located in the Valentine 's Mansion , and its students began to wear the Caulfield Grammar School uniform . From 1949 to 1979 , Caulfield had operated Shaw House , its primary school located in Mayfield Street , St Kilda East , offering kindergarten and schooling from Years 1 to 3 . 
 During the 1960s and 1970s , student activism saw changes in the school 's policies relating to students . Appointed prefects were replaced in 1970 by an elected School Committee to represent the student body , the publication of a student newsletter Demos — containing editorials on aspects of the school — was allowed , religious education classes were made voluntary for senior year levels , the position of school chaplain was abolished , and Caulfield was the only APS school to allow its students to participate in moratorium marches protesting the Vietnam War on 8 May 1970 . 
 The school 's centenary year , 1981 , marked the appearance of the first girls at Caulfield , as a second senior school campus opened at Wheelers Hill on 26 April . Caulfield had purchased the land for a future project in 1969 , and a new campus was established to celebrate the centenary . Wheelers Hill began as a coeducational school for all year levels . In 1993 , the other campuses opened to girls , making Caulfield fully coeducational . 
 The school established a computer network in 1997 with all students and staff having individual log in details , email accounts , and file space . Unlike other Australian independent schools , Caulfield Grammar School has not followed the trend of making laptops compulsory for students . However , the school provides an online login system or <unk> for students and staff that is accessed via existing entry passwords and usernames . This capability is referred to as the School 's sixth or " virtual " campus , and enables access to email and files from the school network over the Internet . 
 After Caulfield Campus ' historic War Memorial Hall , built in 1958 , was burnt down in an electrical fire on 14 November 2000 — a Melbourne Cup public holiday — Caulfield Grammar School began to plan the construction of major halls at both Caulfield and Wheelers Hill campuses , naming the project " The Twin Halls " . The Memorial Hall at Wheelers Hill was officially opened on 28 July 2005 and the Cripps Centre at Caulfield Campus opened on 25 October 2005 . Each hall seats 650 people ; the Wheelers Hill hall including a new chapel fitted with a multimedia centre and Caulfield hall including a music / visual art department . 
 Caulfield Grammar School now has over 3 @,@ 000 students throughout its three @-@ day campuses . It is the only Melbourne @-@ based school in the APS to provide boarding for both boys and girls , with nearly 100 boarding students from rural Australia , Melbourne and overseas . For non @-@ international students , fees range from A $ 14 @,@ 000 to A $ 25 @,@ 000 per year for day students , and in excess of $ 30 @,@ 000 for boarding students . Caulfield received A $ 2 @,@ 134 @,@ 444 as estimated <unk> ( federal funding ) in 2000 , which increased to A $ 6 @,@ 573 @,@ 791 in 2004 . As with most Australian independent schools , Caulfield is not a full fee paying institution ; full fees apply only to international students , who are not subsidised by government funding . 
 The 125th anniversary of Caulfield 's founding was marked in 2006 and various events were held in commemoration . On 26 April 2006 , the school community held a day of celebrations ( ANZAC Day — a national public holiday — is held in Australia on 25 April , the actual anniversary of the founding ) . Staff and students at all five campuses of the school — with student groups visiting both the Nanjing and Yarra Junction campuses at the time — formed " <unk> " at their respective campuses and an aerial photograph was taken . Other celebrations during the year included a 125th Anniversary Ball at Crown Casino for past and present staff and parents , as well as past students . The annual Founders ' Day service at St Paul 's Cathedral was attended by guest of honour , Governor of Victoria Dr. David de <unk> , a past parent of the school . The School Council commissioned author Helen Penrose to write a history of the school entitled Outside the Square , which was released in 2006 . 
 The school is a member of the Associated Public Schools of Victoria ( APS ) , and is affiliated with the Headmasters ' and Headmistresses ' Conference , the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia ( <unk> ) , the Junior School Heads Association of Australia ( JSHAA ) , the Australian Boarding Schools ' Association , and the Association of Independent Schools of Victoria ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Yarra Junction Campus = = = 
 In 1947 , a country centre opened at Yarra Junction on land donated by the Cuming family . Cuming House was the first outdoor education campus for an Australian school , set in the Australian bush and close to the Yarra River . The Yarra Junction Campus today allows students to live in sustainable eco @-@ cabins with rainwater tanks and solar power technology . The Earth Studies Centre , <unk> ( Aboriginal term for ' learning place ' ) , operates on wind and solar power , and uses many environmentally sound practices to teach students about long @-@ term environmental sustainability . Also on campus is a commercial dairy which produces over 1 million litres of milk annually . On United Nations World Environment Day 2001 the Yarra Junction Campus won an award for Best School Based Environment Project for its energy @-@ saving eco @-@ cabins project . 
 = = = Nanjing Campus = = = 
 The school opened a fifth campus in Nanjing , China in 1998 , with a residential campus constructed on property owned by the High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University . This became the first overseas campus for an Australian high school , and the first campus established by a foreign secondary school in China . It is staffed by six full @-@ time Australian teachers , as well as four trainees selected from the school 's annual graduating Year 12 class who complete 12 month gap year placements . Most Caulfield Year 9 students take part in five week internationalism programs and are based in Nanjing . 
 Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard and then @-@ Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett both sent formal congratulations letters to Caulfield on the campus ' establishment , and Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer witnessed the signing of an agreement to build the campus in 1996 ; also present were the Mayor of Nanjing , the Principal of the High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University , and Caulfield 's principal Stephen Newton . The Governor of Victoria James Gobbo officially opened the campus on 6 May 1998 . Caulfield focuses on Mandarin Chinese as its major Language Other Than English , with the language first offered as a senior school subject in 1963 , and later becoming the sole Asian language taught as it had higher student enrolments than Indonesian . It has been taught at every year level across all three campuses since 1994 , and the establishment of a campus in Nanjing allowed the school to strengthen its ties with the region . Nanjing was selected as the campus ' location in part because Jiangsu province , of which Nanjing is the capital and largest city , is Victoria 's sister @-@ state , and Nanjing University had previously established an Australian studies department . 
 Controversy arose in June 2001 when a group of six Caulfield students at the Ming Tombs were found to have graffitied this site , writing their full names on a wall near to the tomb entrance . The story was reported on the front page of Melbourne 's major newspapers , The Herald Sun and The Age , after the students were returned home to Australia . The school , in conjunction with Australian consular officials , resolved the issue with the Chinese government . 
 When a global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) occurred in 2003 , and had the highest confirmed cases in China , the school postponed all scheduled trips to China in 2003 indefinitely . The group which was in China at the time of the outbreak – March and April 2003 – travelled to Xi 'an instead of Beijing to avoid the peak areas of infection , and returned to Australia via Tokyo 's International Airport several days before the scheduled departure on the advice of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade . The remaining groups returned in the second half of 2003 to participate in shortened three @-@ week programmes . 
 On 5 May 2008 , Caulfield celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Nanjing Campus and held two concerts hosted at the High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University . 
 Stephen Newton , Caulfield 's principal from 1993 to 2011 , was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2012 , for " distinguished service to education in the independent schools sector , through executive roles with professional organisations and advisory bodies , and to the development of educational development opportunities with China , " recognising his role in founding the Nanjing Campus . 
 = = Academics = = 
 Caulfield offers students a wide range of subjects in its academic curriculum . All students study Mandarin Chinese – the school 's major Language Other Than English , taught because of China 's developing importance in the Asia @-@ Pacific region – from primary school to Year 8 , and German in Years 7 and 8 , and may continue these languages as electives thereafter . The school awards scholarships for a range of fields , including academic excellence , theatre , music , art and sports . 
 = = = Middle school structure = = = 
 Caulfield has reorganised the early years of secondary school , which had previously been overshadowed by the VCE ( Years 10 – 12 ) and attempts to upgrade programmes for senior students . Years 7 through 9 make up the middle school , and operate differently from the later VCE years . New initiatives at the middle school include a learning mentor programme , introduced in 2004 at the Year 8 level , and expanded to Year 7 in 2005 . This provides every class with two teachers to around 30 students . Each class is assigned a learning mentor , who attends all of that group 's lessons and assists each student with improving their own learning style . The mentor focuses on both academic and pastoral issues , while the designated subject teacher is responsible for preparing and teaching the set curriculum . 
 Year 9 at Caulfield is seen as a year where students prepare to undertake the VCE ( Years 10 – 12 ) . Students do not have examinations , as would happen in any other senior school year at Caulfield , but rather focus on their classroom studies and the Learning Journeys programme . Learning Journeys is a combination of various subjects previously studied in Year 9 – history , geography , religious education and personal development – with students working in groups of around 15 pupils to one teacher . Classes last for one full school day each week , and students regularly participate in numerous excursions as part of the subject 's curriculum . 
 Year 9 is also the year in which most students participate in the China internationalism programme at the Nanjing campus . Approximately 300 students attend the campus annually ; students who do not take part in the programme study international culture in Australia and are based in Melbourne . Students study five key themes of Chinese culture during one of six five @-@ week programmes offered throughout the year : heritage , work , family , education and environment . Students are based at the residential campus in Nanjing , and also spend three days in Shanghai , one day in Tong Li , Suzhou , and four days in Beijing , with lessons based around visits to sites such as the Great Wall of China , the Forbidden City and the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum . They also complete two day homestay visits with students from the High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University , and participate in English and Mandarin language lessons with their homestay partners . In addition to the Year 9 programmes , a two @-@ week study tour for Year 11 students studying Chinese as a Second Language is held annually in the break between Term 3 and 4 . These students travelling to the Nanjing campus for language lessons and activities , including a homestay visit with students from the High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University , and also spend time in Shanghai and Hangzhou . 
 = = = Victorian Certificate of Education = = = 
 Caulfield Grammar School senior students study for the Victorian Certificate of Education ( Caulfield does not offer the International Baccalaureate ) , achieved after graduating from Year 12 . While the VCE is usually completed over two years , in 2003 Caulfield began to encourage Year 10 students to take as many as three VCE Unit 1 / 2 courses usually studied at Year 11 . This programme is seen as giving students a taste of the VCE a year earlier , thereby giving them a chance to prepare for what is to come ; it also allows Year 11 students to undertake Unit 3 / 4 studies , so that they effectively begin part of their Year 12 course a year earlier , maximising their <unk> scores by studying up to six subjects over this time . 
 Year 11 students studying Mandarin may return to China on a two @-@ week language @-@ focused study tour at the Nanjing campus . For students studying German , there are places available for exchanges to Germany during the summer holidays . 
 Both of Caulfield 's campuses ranked in the top 40 schools in Victoria for 2009 results , including the top 30 amongst private schools . Caulfield also has associations with Australian universities which have led to the introduction of annual awards for VCE students at the school . One Year 12 graduate from the school is awarded a Collegiate Partnership Scholarship to attend Bond University , a private university in Queensland , with 50 % of tuition for an undergraduate degree provided . 
 = = = Outdoor education = = = 
 The Yarra Junction campus hosts student camps at various year levels : Year 3 students attend for one day , Year 5 students for three days , Year 7 students have one week camps , and Year 8 students have 11 day programmes including a three @-@ day outdoor camping activity . At each of the camps involving overnight stays by students , student leaders currently in Years 10 and 11 accompany groups for the duration of their programmes . Year 10 and 11 students wishing to act as leaders attend a leadership camp at the campus at the end of the previous school year , and a number are then selected to take part in student camps . As part of various camps , students stay in eco @-@ cabins and must monitor their use of both water and electricity . Lessons also take place at <unk> and at the campus dairy .

 Caulfield offers an extracurricular activities programme for students . The major components of the programme are sport , music and the Arts . 
 = = = Sport = = = 
 Students from Years 5 to 12 participate in school sport as part of the APS competition . 
 Caulfield was one of the founding members of the Schools ' Association of Victoria in 1882 , but when the legitimacy of the association 's amateur status was questioned , Caulfield and Brighton Grammar School formed the Schools ' Amateur Athletic Association of Victoria in 1911 ( renamed the Associated Grammar Schools of Victoria in 1921 ) , and were joined by other Melbourne private and church schools in the competition . In 1958 , Caulfield accepted an offer to join the Associated Public Schools of Victoria . The APS was Victoria 's most competitive school sporting association , and after initially poor results the school introduced compulsory involvement in sporting teams in 1958 in an attempt to improve its performance . Caulfield currently holds an APS record for winning 12 consecutive APS Boys ' Athletics Championships from 1994 to 2005 , and has won numerous 1st Division premierships throughout its history . The First XVIII football team won 18 consecutive premierships from 1913 to 1930 – the longest championship run for a Caulfield Firsts team . 
 For students from Years 5 to 12 , inter @-@ school sport is a compulsory activity . Teams usually train twice a week , often travelling between Caulfield and Wheelers Hill or to other sporting venues , and play matches against other APS schools on Saturdays . Sports played include cricket , football , rowing , athletics and swimming . A United Kingdom Cricket and Tennis tour every three years sees Caulfield Grammar students play matches against students from such schools as Eton College and The King 's School , Canterbury . 
 The main facilities for sport are shared over both Caulfield and Wheelers Hill campus . At Caulfield , the Lindsay Thompson Centre is used for indoor sports such as basketball and netball , and the Alfred Mills Oval is the traditional home of the First XI cricket and First XVIII football teams . The oval has been a venue of matches in the 2004 Commonwealth Bank Under 19 Cricket Championships , and the venue for a match between the England women 's cricket team and the Victoria Spirit women 's team in January 2008 . Wheelers Hill includes four sports ovals , AstroTurf tennis and hockey courts , and outdoor netball courts . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 Like many other private schools , Caulfield Grammar School has withstood a deal of criticism on the practice of offering lucrative scholarships to students who excel in sporting competitions . The Age has reported that several students from Christian Brothers College , St. Kilda were lured to Caulfield after sporting events . Although the school does not offer sports scholarships as such , many talented students are attending on ' General excellence ' scholarships . 
 = = = The Arts = = = 
 Primary students in Year 2 learn to play either the violin , viola or cello , and for most students this is their first introduction to the Caulfield music programme . Year 4 students choose one of seven of woodwind and brass instruments to learn for a year . Year 7 students also take part in compulsory music tuition where they may choose one instrument to learn as part of a small group , with a range of musical groups represented including guitars , brass , woodwind and percussion . They may also take part in a singing group , or work in a composition workshop where they learn about songwriting , patterns in music and improvisation . Students who wish to learn an instrument in private lessons may do so from prep through to Year 12 , and many of these musicians go on to join various musical ensembles available at Caulfield . School bands , choirs and orchestras are open to students from Year 3 onwards , and many of these musical groups are on show at the annual Caulfield Grammar School Concert at Melbourne 's Hamer Hall . Senior choirs and bands also take part in such events as the <unk> Choral Festival and Melbourne Bands Festival . 
 Caulfield 's most senior orchestral group is the <unk> Orchestra , which is primarily a string group , but expands to add other instruments when required . The group went on a small tour to England and Austria in June and July 2000 . In 2006 , the " No Strings Attached " stage band and the senior concert band toured European nations , and was featured in the Montreux Jazz Festival on 5 July 2006 . School music groups rehearse regularly in the music departments at each of the three campuses , and students from Wheelers Hill and Caulfield perform together in the three premier groups at Caulfield Grammar – the <unk> Orchestra , the No Strings Attached stage band , and the Chamber Choir . These groups perform at major school events such as the annual year @-@ ending Speech Night presentations , the Founders ' Day chapel service , and the School Concert , as well as performing at music festivals in Melbourne and on tours . In 2005 renowned Australian jazz musician James Morrison performed with the " No Strings Attached " stage band at Monash University . 
 Caulfield also competes in the Debaters Association of Victoria Schools competition , and Caulfield Campus is the host venue for the Caulfield regional competition . Five debates are held each year , and Caulfield teams debate against other Melbourne schools on various current interest topics . Students are also involved in mooting , where teams argue legal matters based on evidence and precedent , and compete in the Bond University <unk> competition . 
 The school 's theatre department produces productions at both primary and secondary level across all three metropolitan campuses . Previously , students have performed in drama tours to European and Asian countries . 
 = = Alumni = = 
 All past students of the school are members of the Caulfield Grammarians ' Association ( CGA ) , which coordinates reunions , alumni sporting teams and other activities for alumni , known as Caulfield Grammarians . The CGA was formed in 1885 , and is believed to have been in continuous operation since 1906 , the year of the 25th anniversary of Caulfield 's founding . The Caulfield Grammarians Football Club competes in the Victorian Amateur Football Association , and has been represented by notable former Australian rules football players , including Dean Anderson and Duncan Kellaway ( both past students of Caulfield ) , as well as Glenn Archer and Anthony Stevens . 
 A number of Caulfield alumni have made significant contributions in the fields of government , sports , music , business and academia among others . Among those who have had involvement in politics , Peter Dowding ( Western Australia ) and Lindsay Thompson ( Victoria ) , have served as state premiers . Chris Judd and John Schultz have both been awarded the Brownlow Medal for the fairest and best player in the Victorian / Australian Football League , and John Landy has held both the men 's mile world record in athletics and the office of Governor of Victoria . John Clifford Valentine Behan , later second Warden of Trinity College at the University of Melbourne , became the first Victorian Rhodes Scholar after graduating as the Dux of Caulfield Grammar School in 1895 . Fred Walker founded the company that first created and sold Vegemite , an Australian spread and cultural icon . 
 The rock group The Birthday Party was formed by Nick Cave , Mick Harvey and Phill Calvert while they were students at the school in 1973 , and Cave and Harvey would later form the band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds , which released Top 10 albums in Australia and the United Kingdom . Cave and Harvey had been members of the school choir under the direction of Norman Kaye , who became a noted actor and musician after working at Caulfield as a music teacher and choirmaster . 
 = University Mall ( Little Rock , Arkansas ) = 
 University Mall was a shopping center in central Arkansas which operated for approximately 40 years , from 1967 until 2007 . When it closed , University Mall was the oldest enclosed shopping center in the Little Rock metropolitan area . Located in the central part of Little Rock , the site is situated along South University Avenue , north of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and Interstate 630 . The mall was managed by Indianapolis @-@ based Simon Property Group . 
 The Mall was initially a huge success , but its popularity declined as new retail outlets in Little Rock drew customers away . Then the departure of its anchor stores , beginning with the bankruptcy of Montgomery Ward in 2001 , left more than half the building empty . Throughout the 1990s , the mall steadily declined as retailers and customers left . Due to the waning popularity and litigation involving the deterioration of the building , the mall was sold in 2007 to Strode Property Company , and the remaining few tenants were told to vacate . Demolition began for the primary structure in early 2008 . Prior to this , associated buildings were razed beginning in December 2007 , starting with the former Montgomery Ward auto center , as well as the former JCPenney auto center , which had been used several years as an automotive maintenance facility for the City of Little Rock .

 = = = Development = = = 
 The developer was Melvin Simon & Associates , an Indianapolis @-@ based real estate developer and management company that is now known as the Simon Property Group Inc . This was the company 's first venture in Arkansas ; however , they had already built around 40 other shopping centers in the United States . The landowners were stockholders in a corporation that was listed as Developers Inc . Developers Inc. included " Judge " William J. Smith , a prominent Little Rock Attorney and adviser to Gov. Orval E. Faubus . Smith 's wife , daughter , and Son in Law Mr. and Mrs. William L. Patton , Jr. and John Cella of St. Louis who owned Oaklawn Jockey Club , the thoroughbred racetrack in Hot Springs , Arkansas . Developers Inc. dissolved a few months before the announcement of the mall . According to newspapers from the time stockholders of the former corporation became the owners of the mall property . George Cella and Bill Patton , children of the original corporation owners , were mentioned in the later litigation regarding the property that led to its closure and sale in 2007 . 
 Smith told a reporter that he got the idea for the mall when he was driving down University Avenue in the 1950s , when it was known as Hayes Street . He felt that it was a good buy and called John Cella and told him it would be a good investment for them . During the next 15 years , the two managed to acquire the surrounding 28 acres ( 110 @,@ 000 m2 ) for the mall site . This included a cemetery that was moved during construction . The acreage was leased to the Simon Property Group until 2026 . 
 Plans for the mall were announced in 1965 . Simon is quoted as saying that the site offered " the best potential he had ever seen " for a city the size of Little Rock . The mall complex comprised 565 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 52 @,@ 500 m2 ) leasable square feet , the rest for parking of 2 @,@ 500 cars , and was a single level structure when it opened . MM Cohn was the first major department store to sign a lease at the new mall . At the time , it was one of the three big locally owned department stores in downtown Little Rock . A few weeks later , Montgomery Ward and J.C. Penney announced that they too would build their own stores on the property as well . Montgomery Ward built a 136 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 12 @,@ 600 m2 ) square foot store on the southeast corner of the mall . It marked a return of the national store to full @-@ scale operation in Little Rock , where it had operated only a catalog store downtown for 11 years . The addition and a 37 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 3 @,@ 400 m2 ) warehouse took up about 40 percent of the mall 's square footage . The J.C. Penney store , at the west end of the mall , contained some 160 @,@ 000 square feet ( 15 @,@ 000 m2 ) and a free @-@ standing auto center , marking it the largest department store in the state . 
 = = = 1975 and 1987 renovations = = = 
 In 1975 , the mall underwent some cosmetic renovation and was renamed from simply The Mall to University Mall , probably to diversify it from the new McCain Mall Simon was planning for North Little Rock . The mall 's reopening was held in March of that year . News accounts say that special emphasis was placed on a security program . University Mall drew thousands of shoppers yearly and was known for its holiday displays and programs . It also became a favorite place for many walkers , including retirees and heart patients from St. Vincent Infirmary Medical Center , located just across University Avenue . 
 In October 1987 , Simon announced a $ 15 million expansion and renovation of the University Mall structure . The renovation was handled by the <unk> Construction Co. of Tulsa and started in 1988 , ending about a year later . The expansion would add 70 @,@ 000 square feet ( 6 @,@ 500 m2 ) to existing 565 @,@ 000 square feet ( 52 @,@ 500 m2 ) in the mall . Several existing tenants also said they would spend another $ 3 million on remodeling and expansion . MM Cohn updated their store and added a mall entrance on their second floor . The J.C. Penney store was enlarged . This expansion gave the mall its most distinctive feature , the unusual Teflon @-@ coated tent @-@ like structure over part of the new concourse . It was referred to as the skylight because it let so much light in . The skylight reached nine stories high and a height variance had to be sought for its construction . The concourse was expanded to two levels connected by escalators and an elevator . The new upper level had a cantilevered walkway overlooking the bottom level and a 9 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 840 m2 ) food court . A multi @-@ level parking garage was also built on the north side of the mall . 
 A grand four @-@ day reopening was held in November 1988 . Corbin Bernsen of the television show L.A. Law was brought in to help celebrate . An oversized electrical switch turned on the lights that officially reopened the renovated mall . The reopening also featured an elaborate carousel as its centerpiece . 
 By this time , the mall had about 55 stores and was expecting eventually to house 70 . The mall had some 697 @,@ 000 square feet ( 64 @,@ 800 m2 ) of leasable space . However , there was other retail activity in the city that would eventually affect University Mall . Herring Marathon Group Inc. of Dallas unveiled plans to convert the then @-@ open @-@ air Park Plaza shopping center into an enclosed mall directly across Markham Street , just north of University Mall . The Park Plaza shopping center was almost 30 years old at the time , and a landmark of the rapidly expanding West Little Rock area . Herring Marathon said that it would completely rebuild and enclose the total area , increasing it to 676 @,@ 569 square feet ( 62 @,@ 855 @.@ 3 m2 ) — including 25 @,@ 000 square feet ( 2 @,@ 300 m2 ) of new retail area , plus a new 86 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 8 @,@ 000 m2 ) Dillard 's store anchoring the west end of Park Plaza . Builders estimated that the work would cost about $ 20 million . Renaissance Properties Ltd. of Little Rock , which had created the Main Street Mall in downtown Little Rock , announced its 22 initial tenants . For the next decade , University Mall still had plenty of business . But when the Main Street Mall succumbed to the effects of Little Rock 's dying downtown , McCain Mall and Park Plaza emerged as the best places to shop . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 The first real problems with University Mall started appearing in the 1980s when tenants voiced concerns about remodeling and marketing efforts . <unk> Drug began closing its stores everywhere , three in Little Rock alone in 1997 . In 2001 , Montgomery Ward went bankrupt and closed all of its stores leaving a two @-@ story 140 @,@ 900 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 13 @,@ 090 m2 ) vacant building on the University Mall site . Shopping traffic dropped dramatically afterward and a steady stream of tenants began leaving the property . In the beginning of 2001 Simon Property said the occupancy of University Mall was at 95 percent . In April 2001 , after the departure of Montgomery Ward , a report by the Urban Land Institute of Washington , D.C. , said 40 percent of the mall was vacant . In 2004 the William L. Patton Jr . Family Limited Partnership of Arkansas and southern Real Estate and Financial Co. sued Simon Property Group Inc seeking an injunction forcing Simon to " undertake any and all actions necessary " to restore the mall to good conditions . The land owners said the entire mall was in a state of disrepair and neglect . They claimed that Simon 's neglect to maintain the building had been driving away tenants for decades . A team of inspectors hired by the landowners to document the condition of the mall testified in 2005 that the vacant Montgomery Ward space was full of puddles , moldy ceiling tiles , and dead pigeons . 
 In December 2006 , Simon presented a proposal to raze the mall and build a 625 @,@ 000 to 675 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 62 @,@ 700 m2 ) mixed use facility with retail , office , medical , and residential space at a news conference at the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce building in Little Rock . The project would have potentially included half a dozen individual structures , including a big @-@ box retailer on the west , two high @-@ rise multifamily residential buildings on the north and a multistory medical office complex on University Avenue . Paschall Strategic Communications , who was assisting with Simon ’ s public relations campaign on the project , said that the negotiations were “ going very well ” , however these plans did not apparently come to pass . 
 In June 2007 , US District Judge Bill Wilson , Jr. ruled that Simon must make more than $ 7 million in repairs to get the mall into " good and tenable condition " . Pending the sale of the property , the lawsuit was dropped .

 In October 2007 , the William L. Patton , Jr . Family Limited Partnership and the Southern Real Estate & Financial Co. sold the 27 acres ( 110 @,@ 000 m2 ) beneath the mall and another acre with a convenience store on the corner of Markham and McKinley . Dallas @-@ based Strode Property Company , led by Jim Strode , under the name of SPC Park Avenue Limited Partnership took out a loan for $ 27 @.@ 65 million mortgage from Texas State Bank of Dallas and purchased the mall property for $ 21 million . The Simon management issued a deadline to the remaining tenants to vacate the mall by midnight on October 27 . Strode reportedly planned to demolish the mall and build an open @-@ air shopping center called " Park Avenue " similar to the <unk> Little Rock shopping center just to the northeast of the property . Strode said that after knocking down the old mall he planned to build a “ lifestyle center ” with a Main Street feel . The only parts of the old University Mall that would be integrated into Park Avenue were the parking deck , with a possible third level added , and the Montgomery Ward basement . 
 Saturday , October 27 , 2007 was the last shopping day at the mall , although only two locally owned retailers remained open — Paul 's Shoes and Nouri Dress Shop . ( Both businesses relocated to Shackleford Crossings , on the property which had been slated as the long @-@ disputed potential Summit Mall site . ) The entire University Mall property was then surrounded by chain link fence or other barricades following the exit of all tenants . Demolition of buildings in outer parcels began in December 2007 , with demolition of the primary structure starting January 2008 and finishing up in March . Strode projected that its mixed @-@ used Park Avenue development would open on the site in 2010 . 
 The property where the mall was is now a Target store and parking lot .

Princeton qualified for the NCAA Men 's Lacrosse Championship in three of Trombino 's four years ( 2004 , 2006 & 2007 ) . 
 As a freshman , Trombino was expected to be a midfielder , but he surprisingly earned a spot in the first team attack unit . He became the first Princeton freshman to score at least one goal in all 15 of his games ( the prior record had been a goal in 10 different games ) . Trombino was the 2004 Men 's Ivy League Rookie of the Year . The team were Ivy League co @-@ champions with Cornell .

 The 1920 Hammond Pros season was the franchise 's inaugural season in the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) and second as an American football team . The Pros entered 1920 coming off a 4 @-@ win , 2 @-@ loss , 3 @-@ tie ( 4 – 2 – 3 ) record in 1919 as an independent team . Several representatives from another professional football league , the Ohio League , wanted to form a new national league , and thus the APFA was created . 
 The Pros opened the 1920 season with a 26 – 0 loss to the Rock Island Independents . The team did not score a point until their third game , and ended the season with a 2 – 5 record , which placed it tied for 11th place in the final standings . The sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the 1920 All @-@ Pro list , but no players from the Pros were on it . As of 2012 , no player from the 1920 Hammond Pros roster has been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame . 
 = = Offseason = = 
 The Hammond Pros , who were named the Hammond All @-@ Stars , finished 4 – 2 – 3 in their 1919 season as an independent team . The All @-@ Stars disbanded , and three teams were created from those players : the Chicago Tigers , the Decatur Staleys , and the Pros . After the 1919 season , representatives of four Ohio League , a professional football league based in Ohio , teams — the Canton Bulldogs , the Cleveland Tigers , the Dayton Triangles , and the Akron Pros — called a meeting on August 20 , 1920 to discuss the formation of a new professional league . At the meeting , they tentatively agreed on a salary cap and pledged not to sign college players or players already under contract with other teams . They also agreed on a name for the circuit : the American Professional Football Conference . They then invited other professional teams to a second meeting on September 17 . 
 At that meeting , held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay 's Hupmobile showroom in Canton , representatives of the Rock Island Independents , the Muncie Flyers , the Decatur Staleys , the Racine Cardinals , the Massillon Tigers , the Chicago Cardinals , and the Hammond Pros agreed to join the league . Representatives of the Buffalo All @-@ Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting but sent letters to Hay asking to be included in the league . Team representatives changed the league 's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers , installing Jim Thorpe as president . Under the new league structure , teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed , so there were no minimum or maximum number of games needed to be played . Also , representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy .

 = Kingdom of the Isles = 
 The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides , the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD . The islands were known to the Norse as the Suðreyjar , or " Southern Isles " as distinct from the Norðreyjar or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland . The historical record is incomplete , and the kingdom was not a continuous entity throughout the entire period . The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles , although only some of the later rulers claimed that title . At times the rulers were independent of external control , although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway , Ireland , England , Scotland or Orkney . At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory . The islands involved have a total land area of over 8 @,@ 300 square kilometres ( 3 @,@ 205 sq mi ) and extend for more than 500 kilometres ( 310 mi ) from north to south . 
 Viking influence in the area commenced in the late 8th century , and whilst there is no doubt that the Uí Ímair dynasty played a prominent role in this early period , the records for the dates and details of the rulers are speculative until the mid @-@ 10th century . Hostility between the Kings of the Isles and the rulers of Ireland , and intervention by the crown of Norway ( either directly or through their vassal the Earl of Orkney ) were recurring themes . 
 Invasion by Magnus Barefoot in the late 11th century resulted in a brief period of direct Norwegian rule over the kingdom , but soon the descendants of Godred Crovan re @-@ asserted a further period of largely independent overlordship . This came to an end with the emergence of Somerled , on whose death in 1164 the kingdom was split in two . Just over a century later the islands became part of the Kingdom of Scotland , following the 1266 Treaty of Perth . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The principal islands under consideration are as follows : 
 The Isle of Man , located in the Irish Sea equidistant from modern England , Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales . 
 The islands of the Firth of Clyde some 140 kilometres ( 87 mi ) to the north , the largest of which are Bute and Arran . 
 The southern Inner Hebrides to the west and north of the Kintyre peninsula , including Islay , Jura , Mull and Iona . 
 The Inner Hebrides to the north of Ardnamurchan , made up of the Small Isles ( including Eigg and Rùm ) , Skye , Raasay and their outliers . 
 The Outer Hebrides , aka the " Long Island " to the west , separated from the northern Inner Hebrides by the waters of The Minch . 
 These islands , often referred to as the Sudreys , have a total land area of approximately 8 @,@ 374 square kilometres ( 3 @,@ 233 sq mi ) of which : 
 the Isle of Man is 572 square kilometres ( 221 sq mi ) , 7 % of the total 
 the Islands of the Clyde 574 square kilometres ( 222 sq mi ) , 7 % of the total 
 the Inner Hebrides 4 @,@ 158 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 605 sq mi ) , 50 % of the total and 
 the Outer Hebrides 3 @,@ 070 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 185 sq mi ) , 36 % of the total . 
 Anglesey in modern Wales may also have been part of the insular Viking world from an early stage . 
 Orkney is some 180 kilometres ( 110 mi ) east @-@ northeast of the Outer Hebrides , Shetland is a further 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) further northeast and Norway some 300 kilometres ( 190 mi ) due east of Shetland . The total distance from the southern tip of the Isle of Man to the Butt of Lewis , the northern extremity of the Outer Hebrides , is approximately 515 kilometres ( 320 mi ) . 
 = = Early history = = 
 = = = Early Viking incursions in the Hebrides = = = 
 Prior to the Viking incursions the southern Hebrides formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata ( or Dalriada ) . North of Dál Riata the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control although the historical record is sparse . According to Ó Corráin ( 1998 ) " when and how the Vikings conquered and occupied the Isles is unknown , perhaps unknowable " , although from 793 onwards repeated raids by Vikings on the British Isles are recorded . " All the islands of Britain " were devastated in 794 with Iona being sacked in 802 and 806 . Various named Viking leaders , who were probably based in Scotland , appear in the Irish annals : <unk> in 837 , <unk> in 845 and Hákon in 847 . Another early reference to the Norse presence in the Irish records is that there was a king of " Viking Scotland " whose heir , <unk> , took an army to Ireland in 848 . 
 In the 9th century the first references to the Gallgáedil ( i.e. " foreign Gaels " ) first appear . This term was variously used in succeeding centuries to refer to individuals of mixed Scandinavian @-@ Celtic descent and / or culture who became dominant in southwest Scotland , parts of northern England and the isles . 
 According to the Orkneyinga Saga , in about 872 Harald Fairhair became King of a united Norway and many of his opponents fled to the islands of Scotland including the Hebrides of the west coast , and the Northern Isles . Harald pursued his enemies and incorporated the Northern Isles into his kingdom in 875 and then , perhaps a little over a decade later , the Hebrides as well . The following year the local Viking chieftains of the Hebrides rebelled . Harald then sent Ketill Flatnose to subdue them , which he did quickly , but then he declared himself an independent " King of the Isles " , a title he retained for the rest of his life . Ketill is also sometimes equated with <unk> Find , a reported leader of the Gallgáedil fighting in Ireland in 857 , although this connection is far from definite . Ketill left no successors and there is little record of the succeeding four decades . However , Woolf ( 2007 ) suggests that his appearance in the sagas " looks very much like a story created in later days to legitimise Norwegian claims to sovereignty in the region . " 
 There are similar problems with the provenance of Gofraid mac Fergusa , the supposed 9th @-@ century ruler of the Hebrides and ancestor of Clan Donald . It has been suggested that his appearance looks " very much like the product of fourteenth @-@ century propagandists from Clann Donald " . 
 = = = House of Ímar = = = 
 In 870 Dumbarton was besieged by Amlaíb Conung and Ímar , " the two kings of the Northmen " , who " returned to Dublin from Britain " the following year with numerous captives . It is therefore likely that Scandinavian hegemony was already significant on the western coasts of Scotland by then . Amlaíb Conung is described as the " son of the king of Lochlainn " in the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland and Ó Corráin ( 1998 ) argues that Lochlainn " is Viking Scotland and probably includes Man " at this time suggesting an early date for an organised Kingdom of the Isles . In the same source Amlaíb Conung is also recorded as having gone to the aid of his father Gofraidh , who was under assault from Vikings in Lochlainn in about 872 . Gofraidh died in 873 and may have been succeeded briefly by Ímar who also died that year . Amlaíb probably died in 874 . A lament for Áed mac Cináeda , a Pictish king who died in 878 , suggests Kintyre may have been lost to his kingdom at that time . The Norse may have taken the Isle of Man in 877 and they certainly held it by 900 . In 902 the Vikings were expelled from Dublin for up to a dozen years , and a year later Ímar , the " grandson of Ímar " was killed in battle with the forces of Constantine II in mainland Scotland . However these events were setbacks for the Norse rather than a definitive moment . Internecine fighting is recorded in the Annals of Ulster of 914 , which describe Ragnall ua Ímair 's defeat of Bárid mac Oitir in a naval battle off the Isle of Man . 
 The first four decades of the 10th century are an obscure period so far as the Hebrides are concerned . It is possible that Ragnall ua Ímair , who probably ruled Mann during this period may have had some influence . However , Amlaíb Cuarán is the next King of the Isles on record . After the death of Amlaíb mac Gofraid in 941 , Amlaíb Cuarán became King of Northumbria and probably succeeded his cousin Amlaíb as King of Mann . The former is recorded as being the Rex <unk> insularum , suggesting he may have been the first King of both Mann and the Western Isles of Scotland . 
 Amlaíb , who died some four decades later in 980 or 981 whilst in " religious retirement " on Iona , was succeeded by Maccus mac Arailt , who was probably his nephew . Maccus 's brother Gofraid mac Arailt then succeeded him . During their lifetimes these two " sons of Harald " are known to have launched at least two major expeditions against Ireland , and the latter is recorded as having won " the battle of Man " in 987 . Iona was sacked twice , in 986 and 987 , Amlaíb Cuarán 's later piety notwithstanding . This battle of Man , recorded by the Annals of Ulster , is said to have been won by Gofraid and " the Danes " – possibly forces directly from Scandinavia under the command of Olaf Tryggvason . The Annals of Ulster record Gofraid 's death in Dalriada in 989 , describing him as " king of Innse Gall " although it is not clear if this was a completely new term or had originally been used earlier , perhaps to refer to Amlaíb Cuarán 's island kingdom . The complex geography of western Scotland and the lack of written records makes certainty about the extent and nature of these kingdoms hard to fathom . For example , the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba indicates that almost all these kings who reigned from the mid @-@ 10th to the late 11th century were buried on Iona . This may mean that Iona and Mull lay either within or close to the emerging Kingdom of Scotland . Furthermore , two records in the Annals of Innisfallen hint that the Western Isles may not have been " organised into a kingdom or earldom " at this time but rather that they were " ruled by assemblies of freeholders who regularly elected lawmen to preside over their public affairs " . 
 = = = Earls of Orkney and Kings of Dublin = = = 
 At this point the Orkneyinga Saga once again becomes the main source of information about the north . In 990 Sigurd the Stout , Earl of Orkney took control of the Hebrides , and placed a jarl called Gilli in charge . By 1004 the isles ' independence had been re @-@ asserted under Gofraid 's son Ragnal mac Gofraid , who died in that year . It is possible their rule overlapped , with Gilli 's zone of influence to the north and Ragnal 's to the south . On Ragnal 's death Sigurd re @-@ asserted control , which he held until his death at the Battle of Clontarf after which the islands may have been held by Håkon Eiriksson . According to the Welsh text Historia <unk> <unk> Kenan Olaf <unk> is recorded as having been king of a wide variety of places on his death in 1034 . These included the Isle of Man , " many of the other islands of Denmark " , Galloway , the Rhinns , and Anglesey . Olaf was an Uí Ímair dynast and it is difficult to reconcile his rule with that of the Norwegians who apparently came before and after him according to the sagas . There is also an obscure reference in The Prophecy of Berchán hinting that King Máel Coluim mac Cináeda of Scotland may have been active in Islay and Arran at about this time , emphasising the potentially fluid nature of Scandinavian , Norse @-@ Gael and Scots influence during this period . 
 The next recorded ruler is Sigurd the Stout 's son Thorfinn the Mighty , who took control circa 1035 until his own death some two decades later . The continuing close alliance of the Isles with Norway is suggested by a record from the Annals of Tigernach for the year 1058 : " A fleet was led by the son of the king of Norway , with the <unk> of Orkney , the Hebrides and Dublin , to seize the kingdom of England , but God consented not to this " . This monarch of Norway was Magnus Haraldsson , who may have used the death of Thorfinn as an excuse to exert direct rule of Orkney and the Hebrides . 
 However , in the mid @-@ 11th century the Uí Ímair dynast Echmarcach mac Ragnaill is said to be the ruler of Mann . He was also King of Dublin from 1036 – 38 and 1046 – 52 as well as possibly being the King of the Rhinns in Galloway , suggesting that the overlordship of the Isle of Man and the Hebrides were once again sundered , ( although it is possible he ruled over part or all of the Hebrides as well ) . 
 Murchad mac Diarmata is then recorded as having control of Mann and Dublin followed by his father Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó , the High King of Ireland , who took possession of Mann and the Isles until his death in 1072 . Godred <unk> and his son Fingal <unk> then ruled in Mann at least , but the records for the rulers of the Hebrides remain obscure until the arrival of Godred Crovan . 
 = = = Godred Crovan and Irish influence = = = 
 " Crovan " probably means " white hand " although the reason is unknown and his origins are also uncertain . Godred may have been a son or nephew of Imar mac Arailt , King of Dublin and by extension a descendant of Amlaíb Cuarán . He was a survivor of Harald Hardraade 's defeat at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 and fled from there to Man . Little is then heard of him until he succeeded in taking the island from Fingal in 1079 , possibly with the help of troops from the Western Isles . The ancestor of many of the succeeding rulers of Mann and the Isles he also became King of Dublin , but no contemporary source refers either to him or any of his predecessors as " King of Mann and the Isles " as such . He was eventually ousted from Dublin by Muirchertach Ua Briain and fled to Islay , where he died in the plague of 1095 . It is not clear the extent to which Ui Briain dominance was now asserted in the islands north of Man , but growing Irish influence in these seas brought a rapid and decisive response from Norway . A high level of political instability is suggested by the battle fought on the Isle of Man at <unk> in 1098 . This was internal strife between the men of the north of the island under Jarl Óttar , and the southerners led by a man named <unk> or <unk> . 
 = = Later history = = 
 = = = Norse and Uí Briain influence = = = 
 Perhaps as a result of general disorder in the islands , and to counter Irish influence there , Magnus Barelegs had re @-@ established direct Norwegian overlordship by 1098 . He first took Orkney , the northern Scottish mainland and the Hebrides , where he " dyed his sword red in blood " in the Uists . According to the Heimskringla , Magnus had his longship dragged across the isthmus north of Kintyre in 1093 as part of his campaign . By taking command of his ship 's tiller and " sailing " across the isthmus he was able to claim the entire peninsula was an island , and it remained under Norwegian rule for more than a dozen years as a result . 
 In 1098 , Edgar of Scotland signed a treaty with Magnus that settled much of the boundary between the Scots and Norwegian claims in the islands . Edgar formally acknowledged the existing situation by giving up his claims to the Hebrides and Kintyre . 
 A second expedition in 1102 saw incursions into Ireland ; the Heimskringla saga reports that he obtained Muirchertach Ua Briain 's daughter Bjaðmunjo in marriage to his young son , Sigurd , whom he then left in nominal charge of the isles . This arrangement did not last long . On 23 August 1103 Magnus was killed fighting in Ulster and the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Sigurd returned to Norway without his bride . The next king was Lagmann Godredsson , Godred Crovan 's son , who was apparently appointed with Sigurd 's consent . He successfully fought off a rebellion by his brother Harald and after reigning for seven years he abdicated " repenting that he had put out his brother 's eyes " and went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem , where he died . 
 Lagmann abdicated during his surviving son Olave 's minority , and either by force or the invitation of the nobility of the Isles Domnall mac Taidc Ua Briain ( Domnall <unk> ) , a grandson of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill , became overlord of the isles in 1111 . Whatever his route to accession , he proved to be an unpopular tyrant and was expelled by the Islesmen after two years , fleeing to Ireland . 
 Two years later Sigurd attempted to appoint Ingemund ( whose background is unknown ) to take possession of the kingdom of the Isles . However , when Ingemund arrived on Lewis he sent messengers to all the chiefs of the Isles to summon them to assemble and declare him king . In the meantime he and his followers spent the time in " plundering and revelling . They violated girls and matrons , and gave themselves up to every species of pleasure amid sensual gratification . When the news reached the chiefs of the Isles , who had already assembled to appoint him king , they were inflamed with great rage , hastened against him , and coming upon him in the night , set fire to the house in which he was , and destroyed , partly by the sword and partly by the flames , Ingemund and all his followers . " 
 The next recorded king was Godred Crovan 's son Olave Godredsson , also known as " the Red " to the Highlanders and " <unk> " to the Norwegians , the latter apparently on account of his small size . He had spent time at the court of Henry I of England , who may have encouraged his ambitions in an attempt to minimise Ui Briain dominance over the Irish Sea and environs . Olave reigned for forty years , managing to maintain a degree of peace and stability throughout . Nevertheless , the era was not without incident . During his time Oitir Mac mic Oitir , one of the Hebridean nobles , took Dublin by force and held it for six years before his assassination in 1148 . Oitir 's son Thorfinn was described as the most powerful of the Hebridean lords in 1150 . In 1152 Olave 's nephews in Dublin rose against him and attacked Man , killing him in the process . 
 Olave 's son Godred the Black succeeded him and had his father 's killers executed . Shortly thereafter the warring Mac Lochlainn clan in Ireland along with " the fleet of Galloway , Arran , Kintyre , Man , and the territories of Scotland " are recorded fighting a naval battle off Inishowen against the Ui Briain dynasty . During his reign the citizens of Dublin offered Godred the rule of the city , which he accepted . Then , according to the Manx Chronicle , he inflicted a heavy defeat on his erstwhile Mac Lochlainn allies , following which he and his chieftains returned to the islands , leaving the city to the invading forces of Diarmait Mac Murchada . 
 = = = Somerled = = = 
 Godred 's dictatorial style appears to have made him very unpopular with the Islesmen , and the ensuing conflicts were the beginning of the end for Mann and the Isles as a coherent territory under the rule of a single magnate . The powerful barons of the isles began plotting with an emerging and forceful figure – Somerled , Lord of Argyll . Somerled 's parental origins are obscure , but it is known that he had married Ragnhildis , daughter of Olave the Red and Godred 's half @-@ sister . It is possible that Somerled first found favour with Olave by helping him wrest control of the northern Hebrides from the Earls of Orkney , whose influence had once more spread into the Sudreys . Somerled 's popularity led to his son with Ragnhildis , Dubgall , being heralded throughout the Isles ( save Man itself ) as a future King of the Isles by " Thorfinn , son of <unk> " . When Godred heard of this he engaged Somerled 's forces in the naval Battle of Epiphany in 1156 . There was no clear victor , but it was subsequently agreed that Godred would remain the ruler of Man , the northern Inner Hebrides and the Outer Hebrides , whilst Somerled 's young sons would nominally control the southern Inner Hebrides , Kintyre and the islands of the Clyde under their father 's supervision . Two years later Somerled 's invasion of the Isle of Man caused Godred to flee to Norway , leaving the former as undisputed ruler of the entire realm . 
 The Hebrides had been difficult to control from a distance since the days of Ketill Flatnose , and even in the time of Magnus Barelegs it is likely that de facto control was that of local rulers rather than nominal governance from over the seas . Somerled took this to its ultimate conclusion , declaring himself an independent ruler of the isles from his power base in the southern Hebrides and Kintyre and he had , in effect , recreated Dalriada . There has been some debate about the source of legitimacy Somerled used . It has been suggested that claims of his descent from Gofraid mac Fergusa are " preserved in Gaelic tradition and accepted as broadly authentic by modern scholars " . However , Woolf ( 2005 ) asserts that " contrary to the image , projected by recent clan @-@ historians , of Clann Somhairle as Gaelic nationalists liberating the Isles from Scandinavians , it is quite explicit in our two extended narrative accounts from the thirteenth century , Orkneyinga saga and The Chronicle of the Kings of Man and the Isles , that the early leaders of Clann Somhairle saw themselves as competitors for the kingship of the Isles on the basis of their descent through their mother <unk> " and that their claim " to royal status was based on its position as a segment of Uí Ímair . " This prince of Argyll is one of the best known historical figures from the Gàidhealtachd of Scotland , and is known in Gaelic as Somairle mac Gille Brigte , although his Norse name , <unk> , has the literal meaning of " summer traveller " , a common name for a Viking . 
 Somerled met his death in 1164 , possibly assassinated in his tent as he camped near Renfrew during an invasion of the Scottish mainland . At this point Godred re @-@ took possession of his pre @-@ 1158 territories and the southern isles were distributed amongst Somerled 's sons as previously agreed : Dubgall received Mull , Coll , Tiree and Jura ; Islay and Kintyre went to Raghnall ; Bute to Aonghas , with Arran possibly divided between him and Reginald . <unk> and Raghnall at least were styled " Kings of the Isles " . However , their descendants do not seem to have held this title and The Chronicle of Man and the Sudreys lamented that Somerled 's marriage to Ragnhildis " was the cause of the ruin of the whole kingdom of the Isles " . 
 = = = A divided kingdom = = = 
 Somerled 's descendants eventually became known as the Lords of the Isles , with Dubgall giving rise to Clan MacDougall , and Raghnall to Clan Donald and Clan <unk> . Aonghas and his three sons were killed on Skye in 1210 . In theory Somerled and his descendents ' island territories were subject to Norway and his mainland ones to the Kingdom of Alba , whilst the Kings of Mann and the North Isles were vassals of the Kings of Norway . 
 However , both during and after Somerled 's life the Scottish monarchs sought to take control of the islands he and his descendants held . Diplomacy having failed to achieve much , in 1249 Alexander II took personal command of a large fleet that sailed from the Firth of Clyde and anchored off the island of Kerrera . Alexander became ill and died there , but the action was continued by his successor Alexander III . This strategy eventually led to an invasion by Haakon Haakonarson , King of Norway . After the stalemate of the Battle of Largs , Haakon retreated to Orkney , where he died in December 1263 , entertained on his death bed by recitations of the sagas . Following this ill @-@ fated expedition , the Hebrides and Mann and all rights that the Norwegian crown " had of old therein " were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth . 
 In Man , having overcome his usurper brother Ragnald who reigned for a brief time in 1164 , Godred the Black resumed his kingship of Mann and the North Isles . On his death in 1187 , the kingship passed to his eldest son , Raghnall mac Gofraidh , rather than his chosen successor , Olaf the Black ( Raghnall 's half @-@ brother ) , who instead became overlord of Lewis . In 1228 , Olaf battled Raghnall at Tynwald and the latter was slain . On 21 May 1237 , Olaf died on St Patrick 's Isle , and was succeeded by his three sons who all ruled the kingdom in turn : Harald ( reigned 1237 – 48 ) , Ragnvald ( 1249 ) , and Magnus ( 1252 – 65 ) . Magnus Olafsson was the last of the Norse kings to rule Mann , which was absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland on his death . 
 = = Life in Norse times = = 
 As with written records , the archaeological evidence for this period is not extensive , and knowledge of the daily lives of the population is lacking . It is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles , possibly owing to a more relaxed political regime . Latterly , the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis , Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man . 
 Colonsay and Oronsay have produced important pagan Norse burial grounds . An 11th @-@ century cross slab decorated with Irish and Ringerike Viking art found on Islay was found in 1838 . Rubha an Dùnain , today an uninhabited peninsula to the south of the Cuillin hills on Skye , contains the small Loch na h @-@ Airde , which is connected to the sea by a short artificial canal . This loch was an important site for maritime activity for many centuries , spanning the Viking and later periods of Scottish clan rule . There is a stone @-@ built quay and a system to maintain constant water levels . Boat timbers discovered there have been dated to the 12th century . Only three rune stones are known from the west coast of Scotland , on Christian memorials found on Barra , Inchmarnock and Iona . 
 Gaelic continued to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse settlement period , but place @-@ name evidence suggests it had a lowly status . The obliteration of pre @-@ Norse names is almost total . There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery in the north and that of the early Viking period . The similarities that do exist suggests the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland , or by Irish slaves . In the Firth of Clyde , Norse burials have been found on Arran , although not on Bute , and place @-@ name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well @-@ developed than in the Hebrides . There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man . 
 Initially a pagan culture , detailed information about the return of the Christian religion to the islands during the Norse @-@ era is elusive , although the modern @-@ day Diocese of Sodor and Man retains the centuries @-@ old name . 
 = The British Invasion ( Dexter ) = 
 " The British Invasion " is the twelfth episode and finale of the second season , and twenty @-@ fourth overall episode , of the American television drama series Dexter , which first aired on 16 December 2007 on Showtime in the United States . The episode was written by Daniel Cerone ( based on a story by Cerone and Melissa Rosenberg ) and was directed by Steve Shill . In the episode , Lila Tournay ( Jaime Murray ) finds Sgt. James Doakes ( Erik King ) imprisoned in an Everglades cabin and learns from him that her object of affection , Dexter Morgan ( Michael C. Hall ) , is the serial killer known as the " Bay Harbor Butcher " . She decides to help Dexter and kills Doakes by setting the cabin on fire . Meanwhile , Dexter 's sister Debra ( Jennifer Carpenter ) questions whether her career is more important than her relationship with FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy ( Keith Carradine ) . 
 " The British Invasion " was filmed in early November 2007 . Doakes 's death , according to Dexter 's writers , was premeditated from the show 's pilot episode because the character was " too good to not kill " . The episode was seen by 1 @.@ 4 million viewers , according to Nielsen ratings , and received mixed reviews from critics . It was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a One @-@ Hour Series and a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing – Sound Effects and Foley for Short Form Television . The episode was included in TV Guide 's 100 Greatest TV Episodes at no . 49 .

 Using Dexter Morgan 's ( Michael C. Hall ) satellite navigation system , Lila Tournay ( Jaime Murray ) arrives at the cabin in the Everglades . She breaks in to find an imprisoned Sgt. James Doakes ( Erik King ) , who tells her that Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher . She can only sympathize with Dexter , however , for having to hide such an enormous secret , and refuses to unlock Doakes 's cage . Convinced that Dexter is her soul mate , Lila tries to help him by blowing up the cabin with Doakes inside . Meanwhile , FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy 's ( Keith Carradine ) task force has determined Doakes 's location , and Dexter must race his colleagues to reach the cabin first . When he arrives at the cabin , he discovers that it has been destroyed in a fire and at first believes it to be a miracle . The next morning , the police find Doakes 's body in the water , while Dexter embraces his freedom . He visits his girlfriend Rita Bennett 's ( Julie Benz ) house , where they reconcile after having sex . 
 Lt. María LaGuerta ( Lauren Vélez ) , grieving the loss of her former partner , is in denial over Doakes 's incrimination and tries to collect donations for his memorial service . Debra Morgan ( Jennifer Carpenter ) remains determined not to let the end of the Bay Harbor Butcher case break up her relationship with Lundy , but their plans for a vacation are crushed when Lundy is called to Oregon to work on another murder case . 
 With all of the evidence of the Bay Harbor Butcher murders pointing to Doakes as the killer , the case is closed . Forensic investigator Vince Masuka ( C. S. Lee ) tells Dexter the gas in the cabin was turned on while the stove was lit , and when Dexter sees his own satellite navigation system while cataloging evidence , he realizes that Lila must have found the cabin . He meets with her at the aquarium and tells her that he , like her , has no emotion and lives a life devoid of feeling . They form plans to leave Miami together , though Dexter secretly intends to kill her . When he visits her apartment the next day , though , he finds Debra there , trying to persuade Lila to leave town . Dexter is forced to lie about running away with Lila in front of Debra , so a hurt Lila then leaves with what she recognizes as Dexter 's bag of murder equipment . She goes to Rita 's house and drugs the babysitter so that she can abduct the children , Astor and Cody ( Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey ) . When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing , he goes straight to Lila 's apartment , where she lights another fire and locks the three of them inside . Rita calls Debra for her help , and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon with Lundy to help with finding the children . Dexter manages to free Astor and Cody through a small window and eventually rams down a thin wall allowing him to escape . 
 Sometime later , Dexter travels to Paris , where Lila has fled to , and kills her in her hotel room . Back in Miami , he attends Doakes ' memorial service with LaGuerta . Debra and Detective Angel Batista ( David Zayas ) are awarded for their work on the Bay Harbor Butcher case .

 Dexter staff writers Daniel Cerone and Melissa Rosenberg were initially planning to write the script of the finale together . They were in the process of developing the story , however , when Rosenberg was hired to write the film adaptation of the novel Twilight . She described Cerone as " incredibly understanding " when she asked him to write the teleplay himself , though they had both worked on the episode 's story . 
 The writers planned from the pilot episode to eventually kill Doakes off the show . Executive producer Clyde Phillips said that Doakes " always had a shelf life because of the collision course [ with Dexter ] " , while executive producer Sara Colleton believed it would be unrealistic to keep Doakes on for a third season without having him discover that Dexter is a murderer . Rosenberg said that risks had to be taken on the show , and Doakes was " too good to not kill " . The character was killed to prevent recycling of used ideas , so that the writers would " stay aggressive and on top of it rather than repeat ourselves " , according to Phillips . Erik King , who plays Doakes , mentioned the difficulty in killing Doakes off the show because Dexter could not murder an innocent man , and so Lila was Doakes ' killer . 
 Filming of " The British Invasion " concluded production on the second season , and ended in early November 2007 . Filming locations for the episode included Miami , Florida as well as Palos Verdes Estates ( including Rolling Hills United Methodist Church ) , Long Beach ( including the Aquarium of the Pacific ) , Marina del Rey , Rolling Hills Estates , and Los Angeles , California . A " skeleton crew " flew to France to film scenes of Lila walking the streets of Paris .

 " The British Invasion " drew 1 @.@ 4 million viewers on its first broadcast , a 14 percent improvement from the first season finale , " Born Free " . It was Dexter 's most @-@ watched episode until the airing of the third season finale , " Do You Take Dexter Morgan ? " . 
 " The British Invasion " received positive to mixed reviews from critics . Eric Goldman of IGN felt that the episode was thrilling and intriguing , though ultimately " not quite terrific " and rated it 7 @.@ 8 / 10 . He found Doakes 's death dramatically unsatisfying since Dexter was absent , and was disappointed with Debra 's portrayal as " relentlessly needy " . The A.V. Club 's Scott Tobias gave the episode a B + grade , saying that the episode was " for the most part exciting and satisfying " . He felt cheated , however , that Dexter was not forced to decide whether to kill Doakes , and was disappointed that Lila 's character primarily served as a plot device . Writing for TV Guide , Paula Paige believed that the finale " did not disappoint " . She was particularly impressed by Debra 's choice to leave Lundy and LaGuerta 's grief over Doakes 's death . TV Squad 's Keith McDuffee thought that " The British Invasion " was unsurprising and predictable but enjoyable nonetheless . Zap2it reviewer Daniel Fienberg felt that the episode was disappointing in comparison to the first season finale , " Born Free " . He was displeased with the unheroic circumstances of Doakes 's death , the lack of direction in LaGuerta 's character arc and the abrupt end to Debra and Lundy 's relationship . DVD Verdict 's Adam Arseneau called the finale " preposterous " but still " one of the most entertaining cable show finales in recent memory " . 
 Cinematographer Romeo Tirone 's work on the episode was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a One Hour Series , and Dexter 's team of sound editors were nominated for a Golden Reel Award for " The British Invasion " in the category of Best Sound Editing – Sound Effects and Foley for Short Form Television . The episode was unsuccessfully submitted to the Primetime Emmy Awards judging panel for consideration for Outstanding Directing ( Steve Shill ) and Outstanding Supporting Actor ( C. S. Lee ) . 
 = Operation Irma = 
 Operation Irma was the name applied to a series of airlifts of injured civilians from Bosnia and Hercegovina during the Siege of Sarajevo . The airlifts were initiated after the wounding of five @-@ year @-@ old Irma Hadžimuratović attracted international media attention . The programme was reported to have evacuated hundreds of <unk> during the second half 1993 , but attracted significant controversy concerning its scale , evacuee selection criteria , and the motivations of the western European governments and press that inspired it .

 The Bosnian War erupted in March 1992 , following Bosnia and Hercegovina 's declaration of independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . In April 1992 , Bosnian Serb forces , representing the Republika Srpska and the Yugoslav People 's Army , took up positions in the areas surrounding the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and initiated a siege that was to last for four years . The siege was characterized by sniper fire and shelling directed at the city 's buildings and infrastructure and at civilian residents of the city . Reports showed that between the beginning of the siege and November 1992 , an average of eight persons were killed and 44 wounded in Sarajevo per day . 
 = = = July 1993 marketplace mortar = = = 
 On 30 July 1993 , a mortar shell fired by Bosnian Serb troops hit a Sarajevo neighbourhood , injuring five @-@ year @-@ old Irma Hadžimuratović and killing several others , including her mother . Sarajevo 's overstretched Koševo hospital was unable to provide adequate treatment for the injuries Irma received to her spine , head and abdomen . She developed bacterial meningitis as a result . Edo <unk> , the surgeon treating Hadžimuratović , tried unsuccessfully to have her evacuated on a UN relief flight . He then resorted to distributing her photograph among foreign journalists in Sarajevo . Several picked up Irma 's story , giving it widespread coverage in the international ( and especially the British ) press . On the evening of 8 August , BBC news led with coverage of Irma 's injuries . On 9 August , British Prime Minister John Major personally intervened , dispatching an RAF Hercules to airlift Irma to London 's Great Ormond Street Hospital . 
 = = = Commencement of " Operation Irma " = = = 
 In the following days and months dozens more Bosnians were evacuated under a program the UK media dubbed " Operation Irma " . During the week beginning on 9 August , 41 people were taken out of Sarajevo . It was reported later that hundreds were eventually evacuated under the programme . Other countries , including Sweden and Ireland , organized further airlifts , and the Czech Republic , Finland , France , Italy , Norway , and Poland also offered hospital beds . 
 = = Reaction and criticism = = 
 Though Operation Irma was widely publicized , and was reported in September 1993 to have raised £ 1 million in donations to evacuate the wounded from Sarajevo , it attracted a number of criticisms . These addressed the operation 's limited scale , the motives of the British press and foreign governments in launching the airlifts , the devotion of resources to evacuation instead of supplying material support to local medical services , and the broader issue of the United Kingdom 's response to the war in Bosnia . 
 = = = Criticisms over scale = = = 
 Some critics focused on the small numbers of persons evacuated via the operation . During August 1993 the violence in Bosnia killed on average three children each day , and thousands of others were injured or made homeless . Between the beginning of the siege on April 5 , 1992 and the first airlifts under Operation Irma the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) had approved only 200 of Sarajevo 's 50 @,@ 000 critically wounded patients for medical evacuation . The British press storm had prompted offers of 1250 hospital beds in 17 countries by August 15 ; though a vast increase on prior offers of help , the total was dwarfed by the estimated 39 @,@ 000 children requiring hospital treatment throughout Bosnia . 
 = = = The " supermarket " argument = = = 
 As well as the scale of the response , critics questioned the criteria against which patients were selected for evacuation . At first the UK was challenged over its decision to include only children in the transports while tens of thousands of adults remained wounded in the city . Sylvana Foa , spokesperson for the UNHCR , commented that Sarajevo should not be regarded as a " supermarket " of photogenic potential refugees , asking " Does this mean Britain only wants to help children ? Maybe it only wants children under six , or blond children , or blue @-@ eyed children ? " Patrick <unk> , head of the United Nations medical evacuation committee , said that the UK had treated Bosnian children " like animals in a zoo " and was trying to pick and choose evacuees to suit a public relations agenda . When the government revised its approach and included adults on flights out of the city , claims were made that wounded combatants had been among those taken to the UK , Sweden , and Italy , and that patients had paid bribes to be included in the transports . 
 UK Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd , on 9 August , countered that though the operation would evacuate relatively few of the city 's wounded , it was still a benefit : " Because you can 't help everybody , it doesn 't mean you shouldn 't help somebody . " Sylvana Foa also later acknowledged that , after months of Western European indifference toward the war in the former Yugoslavia , the new public sympathy inspired by Irma 's case was " like day following night . " 
 = = = Criticisms of the British government and press = = = 
 Beyond these questions of scale and selection , the motives of both the British press and the government in publicizing <unk> 's case and then in launching Operation Irma were challenged . Some critics disparaged as hypocritical the sudden intensity of coverage devoted to a single victim of what was already a protracted siege . In December 1993 another Sarajevo evacuation program , ' Operation Angel , ' received minimal press coverage in the UK , and the Financial Times suggested that such human interest stories captured the popular imagination only during the British press 's summer ' silly season ' when Parliament was in recess . Susan Douglas , in the October 1993 edition of American magazine The Progressive , said British papers had indulged in " a ghoulish competition to scoop each other over Irma 's condition and to use her evacuation to salve British guilt about standing apart from the carnage in Bosnia . " 
 The British government was widely depicted as having launched Operation Irma in direct response to the level of press interest . Rescuers themselves joked that " Operation IRMA " was an acronym for " Instant Response to Media Attention . " A Council of Europe publication later noted that European governments had been criticized for regarding the exercise as having " more to do with a political and media operation than with humanitarian relief . " The mission also received some criticism in the domestic press : Mark Lawson in The Independent called prime minister Major 's efforts with the mission a " failure ... to silence the hostile snipers " based on a misunderstanding of popular indecision about Bosnia and on a failure to manage domestic press skepticism . 
 Meanwhile , within the former Yugoslavia , Operation Irma was regarded as evidence that the British government had taken sides in the conflict , favouring Bosnian Muslims over Croats or Serbs . 
 = = = Evacuation or local treatment ? = = = 
 Some UN aid workers immediately criticized the operation , arguing that very sick children were poorly served by programmes that obliged them to travel hundreds of miles . They argued , too , that with costs of around £ 100 @,@ 000 per evacuated child the programme was devouring funds that could have been used to improve local facilities and treatment . The head of <unk> Hospital 's plastic surgery department said " It would be much better if you sent the tools to do our jobs properly than for you to make a big show of a few token evacuations . " Countering this , A.D. Redmond of the Overseas Development Administration ( the predecessor to the Department for International Development ) wrote in November 1993 to the British Medical Journal : 
 The Overseas Development Administration has been foremost in supplying medical and humanitarian aid to the people of Bosnia throughout the conflict ... In some circumstances medical teams are needed , requested , and supplied , but in others medical supplies alone are the most appropriate form of aid . I have also , however , received personal pleas from doctors whom I know well to evacuate patients who cannot be treated in Sarajevo ... No solution will suffice . We are all trying to help . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The press coverage surrounding the evacuation was later cited as an example of " disaster pornography " , in academic analyses concerned with the portrayal of child victims of violence and disaster in ways that reaffirm those victims ' remoteness from and subjectivity to western ( here , Northwestern European ) agency . In a similar vein , Dominic <unk> has presented the press interest in Operation Irma as evidence of a popular appetite for news stories that resemble the structure and tone of fictional narratives on war : " War films work most effectively ... by stripping back the too easily confusing contextual details of a conflict and focusing instead on the ' existential ' problem of the protagonist 's experience – the problem of being human in dehumanising circumstances ... News reporting – in this case from the Balkans – then has to compete even at the level of basic comprehension with this already established way of understanding things ... It may not be surprising , therefore , that one of the most memorable news ' stories ' to come out of Bosnia was that of Irma , a rescued child . " The operation has also been portrayed as representative of a trend whereby public reaction to media coverage of disasters leads and shapes official state response , even precipitating the creation of policy where none has existed before . Erica Burman , developing this theme , has argued that Irma Hadžimuratović became an " emotional focus " for a British public dismayed by its government 's ambiguous and cautious attitude to the conflict in Bosnia : 
 The widespread anxieties and consternation over government inactivity throughout the crisis could be deflected and resolved by rescuing a handful of children . In terms of recovering a sense of agency ( in a conflict characterised by protestations of powerlessness by political and military authorities alike ) , the desire to do ( and be seen to do ) something was expressed and assuaged by transporting and incorporating some of the need and distress into the UK where it could be tended to and made better . 
 A textbook on public relations cites the episode as an example of a " bargaining game " in which various players – the UNHCR , British government , and press – all sought to achieve individual advantage . 
 Despite initial improvement , Irma Hadžimuratović was paralyzed from the neck down and required a ventilator to breathe . She died of septicaemia in Great Ormond Street on 1 April 1995 , aged seven , following twenty months in intensive care . The coroner at her inquest called her " a victim of war " . 
 = Into Temptation ( film ) = 
 Into Temptation is a 2009 independent drama film written and directed by Patrick Coyle , and starring Jeremy Sisto , Kristin Chenoweth , Brian Baumgartner , Bruce A. Young and Amy Matthews . It tells the story of a prostitute ( Chenoweth ) who confesses to a Catholic priest ( Sisto ) that she plans to kill herself on her birthday . The priest attempts to find and save her , and in doing so plunges himself into a darker side of society . 
 The film was partially inspired by Coyle 's father , a kind but belligerent man who had considered becoming a priest in his early life . The script won the McKnight Screenwriting Fellowship from the IFP Minnesota Center for Media Arts . Into Temptation was filmed and set in Coyle 's hometown of Minneapolis , Minnesota . Several supporting roles were filled with actors from the Minneapolis – Saint Paul theater area , and Coyle himself performed in a supporting role . 
 It was produced by Ten Ten Films and Farnam Street II , and distributed by First Look International . With a budget of less than $ 1 million , filming began in May 2008 . Cinematography was provided by David Doyle , Russell Holsapple composed the score , and Lee Percy worked as editor . The film touches on themes of temptation , sin , good and evil , redemption and celibacy , as well as the boundaries between a priest providing counsel and getting personally involved with helping parishioners . 
 Into Temptation was optioned in Hollywood , but talks fell through due to complications from the global recession . The film did not receive a national release but played at theaters in several cities . Although first publicly shown for Coyle 's father in December 2008 , Into Temptation officially premiered on April 26 , 2009 , at the Newport Beach Film Festival , where Sisto won the " Outstanding Achievement in Acting " award . The film received generally positive reviews . It was released on DVD on October 27 , 2009 .

Later , he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O 'Brien ( Brian Baumgartner ) , who advises him not to become too personally involved . 
 Father John returns to the red @-@ light district and speaks to a prostitute named Miriam ( Greta Oglesby ) , who suggests a powerful pimp named James St. Clair ( <unk> <unk> ) might know about the woman . As they speak in a bar , the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a john ( Patrick Coyle ) , who leaves with her immediately . As she goes , Father John catches a glimpse of the crucifix she is wearing and tries to chase her down . She leaves in the john 's car before he can catch them , but he writes down the license plate as they drive off . Back at church , his sermons start to grow more unorthodox , and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red @-@ light district have the archbishop concerned . Meanwhile , Father John is contacted by his ex @-@ girlfriend Nadine Brennan ( Amy Matthews ) , who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John . 
 Father John learns the john 's car belongs to an accountant named Steven Miller , who tells Father John the prostitute is Linda , an expensive call girl who is widely considered among the best at her profession . Meanwhile , Linda visits her dying , elderly stepfather Donald Dupree ( Tom Carey ) , who repeatedly raped Linda in her childhood and ultimately set her on the path to prostitution . Linda confronts him about their past , but claims she has forgiven him his sins , even though he continues to deny any wrongdoing . A drunk Nadine goes to talk to Father John in confession about her loneliness and feelings for him . He admits to caring for her as well , but they agree to remain friends . Later , Father John hires Lloyd Montag ( Bruce A. Young ) , an unemployed boxer at his church , to serve as his bodyguard as he talks to St. Clair . The pimp , who knows Lloyd from his boxing days , tells Father John what neighborhood Linda lives in . There , Father John and Lloyd find Zeke ( Tony <unk> ) , a taxi driver who knows they are looking for Linda and agrees to take them to her apartment . Zeke explains he had driven her to the church when she first spoke to Father John at confession , and Zeke later visited the church to watch Father John preach . 
 At the apartment , Father John and Lloyd find Linda has moved out , but they discover she had possessed a 12 @-@ year @-@ old newspaper clipping about Father John 's ordination . Father John offers Lloyd a job helping out at the church , which Lloyd accepts . Father John then returns to his church and cries , fearing he is too late to save Linda . Meanwhile , Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus , who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John . A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus . It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not . In a confession to Father Ralph , Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended . Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead , her soul is immortal , and that Father John 's penance is to absolve her now . Father John does so . The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church , where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein , whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her .

 Into Temptation marks the second film by independent filmmaker Patrick Coyle , who wrote and directed the 2003 drama film Detective Fiction . Coyle said Into Temptation was partially inspired by his father , James Patrick Coyle , a kind but belligerent man who had been encouraged by his mother to become a priest . James entered seminary but dropped out before ordination after he was drafted into serving overseas in World War II and met Margaret Mary Quinlan , who would become his wife and Patrick Coyle 's mother . Coyle conceived of the script for Into Temptation while imagining what kind of priest his father would have been . His father strongly approved of the project , and told Coyle , " Go make that movie . And tell the truth . " Coyle was also partially inspired by his childhood pastor and friend , the Reverend Damian Zuerlein , who performed the marriage ceremony for Coyle and his wife and baptized their children . Coyle said of him , " He 's just a young , energetic , competent , committed , devoted man working with a poor parish . And he loves his work . I was inspired by that . " Coyle said when writing Into Temptation , he did not intend to make a religious film , and said of protagonist Father John Buerlein , " The character could have been a minister or a rabbi or a public defender . He 's a good man trying to do a job the best he can . " 
 Ann Luster , the film 's producer , helped with the script from the earliest stages , and claimed she and Coyle had a deep understanding of how to handle the characters from the start . The film was set in Minneapolis , Minnesota , where Coyle lived and worked as a writer and actor at the time . The fictional church in the story , St. Mary Magdalen 's Downtown Catholic Church , is based in part on the St. Mary Magdalene church in Omaha , Nebraska , where Coyle was raised . However , the real @-@ life church was also very different from the fictional church in that it lacked a shelter and drew very large congregations for weekend mass , compared to the half @-@ empty pews in the fictional church . The fictional church is also based in part on Our Lady of Guadalupe , another Catholic church in south Omaha . The Into Temptation script won the McKnight Screenwriting Fellowship from IFP Minnesota Center for Media Arts , and investors were sought through public readings . After reading the script , Patrick Coyle 's wife said , " If you get a good Father John , you 'll have a good movie . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Jeremy Sisto said he was drawn to the script , and was excited to take on a different project than his regular role of Detective Cyrus Lupo on the NBC crime drama series Law & Order . Sisto said of working on the show , " For nine months we basically do the same episode over and over . This [ Into Tempation script ] came out of nowhere . " Sisto said of working on Into Temptation : " Having just come off a job where there is little room to find true moments and to create a full character , I felt this respite from the task of trying to force a space where I could express something more personal through my job was no less than a creative life saver . " 
 Coyle cold called Kristin Chenoweth 's agent and proposed the part , which is different from her usual roles , and her agent said it was the exact part the actress was seeking . In order to film Into Temptation , Chenoweth took a five @-@ day hiatus from her supporting role on the ABC television series Pushing Daisies . Brian Baumgartner , best known for his supporting role as Kevin Malone in the NBC comedy series The Office , was a regular theater performer in the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area before joining that show . While visiting New York City in May 2008 for an upfront presentation , shortly after having finished filming the fourth season of The Office , Baumgartner was offered the Into Temptation script by Coyle , who asked him to consider taking the role of Father Ralph O 'Brien . Baumgartner said he enjoyed the script and agreed to the part . 
 Writer and director Patrick Coyle plays Steven Miller , one of Linda 's clients . Many of the other minor roles were filled by local Minneapolis actors and community members . Greta Oglesby , who played the street @-@ smart prostitute Miriam , and Isabell Monk O ’ Connor , who played a librarian who helps Father John , were both veterans of the Minneapolis – Saint Paul theater circuit . <unk> <unk> , who played pimp James St. Clair , and Amy Matthews , who played Father John 's ex @-@ girlfriend , were also from the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Into Temptation was produced by Coyle 's production company , Ten Ten Films , and the company Farnam Street II , in association with Cabin 14 Productions . It was distributed by First Look International . About a year before the film was released , Coyle asked Anne Marie Gillen to serve as executive producer . Gillen said she had not responded to a script in such an emotional way since the 1991 drama film Fried Green Tomatoes , which she also produced . Filming , which began in May 2008 , took place entirely in Minneapolis . It included several scenes staged in the city 's Uptown commercial district , where Coyle lived . 
 In addition to his personal connections to the city , Coyle said filming took place in Minneapolis because it was relatively inexpensive to shoot there and hire local actors . He said , " Shooting in Uptown is a filmmaker 's paradise . You 've got everything here . " Into Tempation was produced and shot on a very low budget of less than $ 1 million . Cinematography was provided by David Doyle , who made extensive use of the Red Digital Cinema Camera . The church scenes were filmed at the Incarnation Church in the city . Sisto and Chenoweth both attended mass services at the church as part of their research for the roles . Exterior car scenes were shot in the Uptown district . During one scene in particular , a police car with a siren passed by the actors during a shot . The actors continued uninterrupted , and the final shot was used in the film . 
 Coyle approached Russell Holsapple , a Minneapolis – Saint Paul native and relatively inexperienced composer , to create the score for Into Temptation . Holsapple was given only a few weeks to create the score , which was composed mostly of piano music . Holsapple said Coyle gave him a great deal of artistic freedom and was largely receptive to the themes he wrote . James R. <unk> worked as production designer on the film , and Deborah <unk> served as costume designer . Both are natives of the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area . Vanessa Miles was set decorator , while Sarah Jean <unk> and Amy Hubbard both worked as art directors . 
 Lee Percy served as editor of the film . He said the final cuts provided to him already contained the actors ' strongest performances , but that he placed a greater focus on Father John 's character in an effort to " help the audience get inside him and connect emotionally " . Percy was assisted by editor Scott <unk> . Patrick Coyle 's father , Jim , followed production of the film closely , making weekly calls to inquire about it . When his father 's health started to decline , Patrick Coyle " worked like hell " to finish the film quickly so his father could see it before he died . The film was finished in December 2008 .

 Into Temptation was optioned in Hollywood , but Coyle was displeased when industry officials wanted him to change the ending and make the sex scenes more risque . Due to complications from the financial crisis of 2007 – 2010 , the Hollywood discussions eventually collapsed . It did not receive a national release , but played at theaters in New York City , Los Angeles , Fargo , North Dakota , and several cities throughout Minnesota , including Minneapolis and Duluth . Coyle first publicly showed the film on December 26 , 2008 , at the Omaha hospice where his father Jim was staying for an audience of about 15 people . Jim Coyle , who died a few weeks after the screening , loved the film , describing it as very powerful and truthful . It officially premiered on April 26 , 2009 , at the Newport Beach Film Festival in Newport Beach , California . 
 During its opening weekend at the Lagoon Cinema in Minneapolis , Into Temptation sold more tickets in three days than any other film during its debut weekend , and sold twice the tickets of such major studio films as Taking Woodstock and Quentin Tarantino 's Inglourious Basterds . This resulted in an extended run and strong word @-@ of @-@ mouth that led to exhibitions in other cities . The film earned a total of $ 97 @,@ 457 in gross revenue in the United States . The Into Temptation DVD was released on October 27 , 2009 , with no bonus features . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Into Temptation received generally positive reviews . Variety magazine writer Rob Nelson called it a well @-@ photographed film of " occasionally irreverent wit " , and that Coyle " strikes a near @-@ perfect balance between humor and holiness " . Nelson said the film " falters only in its hokey characterization " of the Chenoweth character . Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called it a " haunting , carefully crafted movie " with simple " matter @-@ of @-@ fact " direction , a " trim and efficient " screenplay , strong acting and solid characters . Covert said , " This is one of very few American films to deal with religious beliefs about faith and salvation with empathy and insight . " OC Weekly writer Matt Coker said Into Temptation had a cohesive script which " strikes just the right cord of reverence for the Catholic faith " . He also praised the moments of comic relief with Sisto and Baumgartner , which he said complimented some of the film 's heavier moments . L. Kent <unk> of the Lincoln Journal Star called Into Temptation a well @-@ made film that " gets the mood right from start to finish " . He complimented the performances and said although pornography and prostitution were familiar film topics , " the film 's nuanced understanding of the priest and his conflicted role in trying to save Linda adds a new element to the old story . " 
 Bob Fischbach of the Omaha World @-@ Herald called the cinematography sharp , the editing crisp , and the acting " uniformly good " . He added , " Best of all , the writing is anchored in reality . Coyle lets his film show rather than tell , and lets viewers reach their own conclusions . " Lavender magazine writer John Townsend said the film conveyed compassionate views of Christianity and complimented the cinematography . Townsend particularly praised Baumgartner 's performance and described the scenes between Sisto and a young boy troubled by his homosexual feelings ( John Skelley ) as " exquisite " . <unk> Doyle , a writer with the website Blogcritics , called it " a touching and introspective film about faith , hope and choice " . Doyle praised the film 's quiet tone and the performances of Sisto and Chenoweth , but said it " occasionally gets a little sleepy in the middle " , and that the subplot involving Father John 's ex @-@ girlfriend could have been cut altogether . Denver Post film critic Lisa Kennedy praised the performances of Sisto and Chenoweth , and complimented Coyle 's understanding of the pastoral work of a parish priest . However , she added that the film " doesn 't break ground as a story , even one about redemption " . Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader called it a " cheesy melodrama " , and wrote , " Writer @-@ director Patrick Coyle tackles such weighty issues as child abuse , alcoholism , hypocrisy , celibacy , and Catholic reforms , but the movie 's spiritual agenda is belied by its voyeurism . " 
 Jeremy Sisto was awarded " Outstanding Achievement in Acting " from the 2009 Newport Beach Film Festival awards .

 Throughout the film , Father John is warned that his role as a priest comes with boundaries , and that he should not become personally involved with the congregants or try to solve their problems except through counseling . However , Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive , substantive impact on the lives of those in his care , particularly Linda . And , in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants , Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life with meaning . He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city 's red @-@ light district to seek her . 
 The film takes a modern , liberal approach to the rules and constraints of Catholicism . Even before Father John decides to help Linda , he is questioning the constraints of his religion and calling . While speaking to a prospective mother struggling over whether to raise her daughter within the strict confines of Catholicism , Father John gives her advice beyond the official dogma and encourages her to be flexible , telling her she should " take what works " from the church teachings . Father John also has an unorthodox view of homosexuality compared to the normal views of the church . This is demonstrated in a scene in which the priest comforts a young man who is struggling with his homosexual feelings . In meeting and interacting with the pimps and prostitutes of the red @-@ light district , Into Temptation blurs the lines between good and evil , and between right and wrong . The negative responses Father John encounters from congregants and the church regarding his trips to the red @-@ light district demonstrate the way sex and poverty are often stigmatized in society . 
 As the title suggests , one of the major themes of the film involves the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling . This is perhaps most strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the vow of celibacy required of Catholic priests . As Father John goes deeper into the red @-@ light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis , he appears to face temptations from the prostitution and overt sexuality surrounding him . Additionally , it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction , as well as a desire to help her . This is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend , for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings . The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions when it comes to maintaining his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine . 
 Into Temptation is also a story of redemption , both for Linda , who is seeking redemption for a life of sin and prostitution , and for Father John , who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood . At the start of the film , Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation ; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time . Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood . But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda , his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored , and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest . The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness , particularly in the way that John 's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life . The film also advocates repentance , and the extent of Linda 's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be .

 Toy Story 2 is a 1999 American computer @-@ animated comedy adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . Directed by John Lasseter and co @-@ directed by Lee Unkrich and Ash Brannon , it is the sequel to the 1995 film Toy Story . 
 In the film , Woody is stolen by a toy collector , prompting Buzz Lightyear and his friends to vow to rescue him , but Woody is then tempted by the idea of immortality in a museum . Many of the original characters and voices from Toy Story return for this sequel , and several new characters — including Jessie ( voiced by Joan Cusack ) , Barbie ( voiced by Jodi Benson ) , Stinky Pete ( voiced by Kelsey Grammer ) and Mrs. Potato Head ( voiced by Estelle Harris ) — are introduced . 
 Disney initially envisioned the film as a direct @-@ to @-@ video sequel . Toy Story 2 began production in a building separated from Pixar , on a small scale , as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug 's Life ( 1998 ) . When story reels proved promising , Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release , but Pixar was unhappy with the film 's quality . Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend . Although most Pixar features take years to develop , the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months . 
 Despite production struggles , Toy Story 2 opened in November 1999 to wildly successful box office numbers , eventually grossing over $ 485 million , and received universal acclaim from critics . Toy Story 2 has been considered by critics to be one of the few sequels to outshine the original , and it continues to be featured frequently on lists of the greatest animated films ever made . The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3 @-@ D re @-@ release in 2009 , 10 years after its initial release . Toy Story 3 was released in 2010 , which was also critically and commercially successful . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Woody prepares to go to cowboy camp with Andy , but Andy nearly rips Woody 's right arm off , which leaves it paralysed . Andy decides to leave Woody behind , and Andy 's mother puts Woody on a shelf . The next day , Woody discovers Wheezy , a penguin squeaky toy , has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker . When Andy 's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale , Woody rescues him , only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector , who takes him to his apartment . Buzz Lightyear and all of Andy 's other toys identify the thief from a commercial as Al McWhiggin , the owner of a toy store called Al 's Toy Barn . Buzz , Hamm , Mr. Potato Head , Slinky Dog , and Rex all set out to rescue Woody . 
 At Al 's apartment , Woody learns that he is a valuable collectable based on a 1950s TV show called Woody 's Roundup and is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo , Japan . While the other toys from the show — Jessie , Woody 's horse Bullseye , and Stinky Pete — are excited about going , Woody wants to return home because he is still one of Andy 's toys . Jessie is upset because the museum is only interested in the collection if Woody is in it , meaning they will return to storage if he is absent from the collection . When his arm is torn off accidentally , Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape but is foiled by someone mysteriously turning on Al 's television set . The next morning , a cleaner repairs his arm and Woody learns that Jessie was once the beloved toy of a child named Emily , who eventually outgrew her and gave her away . Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up , whereas he will last forever in the museum . This convinces Woody to stay , now believing that all toys eventually get discarded by their owners . 
 Meanwhile , Buzz and the other toys eventually reach Al 's Toy Barn . While searching for Woody , Buzz is imprisoned in a cardboard box by another Buzz Lightyear action figure with a utility belt , who thinks he is a real space ranger , like the original Buzz from the first film . The new Buzz joins the other toys , who mistake him as their Buzz . After discovering Al 's plan , they arrive at his apartment while Buzz escapes and pursues them , accidentally freeing an Emperor Zurg toy , who immediately goes after him , intent on destroying him . After the toys find Woody , Buzz rejoins them and proves that he is Andy 's Buzz , but Woody refuses to go home . Buzz reminds Woody of a toy 's " true purpose " and warns him that in the museum , he will only be able to watch children from behind glass and never be played with again . After seeing a boy play with him on the TV , Woody changes his mind and asks the Roundup toys to come with him , but Stinky Pete prevents their escape . 
 Having foiled Woody 's escape the previous night , Stinky Pete reveals that he wants to go to Japan because he was never sold to children , allowing Al to take the Roundup toys with him . Buzz and the gang follow Al , but are caught by Zurg , who battles the new Buzz until Rex knocks him down Al 's apartment . The new Buzz then chooses to remain behind with an injured Zurg . Accompanied by three toy Aliens , Andy 's toys steal a Pizza Planet delivery truck and follow Al to an airport , where they enter the baggage handling system and free Woody . Stinky Pete rips Woody 's arm again while preventing his escape , but is stuffed into a little girl 's Barbie backpack by Andy 's toys to teach him a lesson of what it is like to be played with . They free Bullseye , only for Jessie to end up on the plane bound for Japan . Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye , Woody frees Jessie and the toys find their way home . 
 When Andy returns from camp , he accepts Jessie , Bullseye , and the Aliens as his new toys , thinking his mother bought them , and repairs Woody 's torn arm . Meanwhile , Al 's business has suffered due to his failure to sell the Roundup toys . Woody tells Buzz that he is not worried about Andy discarding him because , when he does , they will still have each other for company . Wheezy 's squeaker has been fixed and he performs a Frank Sinatra @-@ style version of " You 've Got a Friend in Me " .

 Talk of a sequel to Toy Story began around a month after the film 's opening , in December 1995 . A few days after the original film 's release , Lasseter was traveling with his family and found a young boy clutching a Woody doll at an airport . Lasseter described how the boy 's excitement to show it to his father touched him deeply . Lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only , but rather it belonged to others , as well . The memory was a defining factor in the production of Toy Story 2 , with Lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone else who loved the characters . 
 Ed Catmull , Lasseter , and Ralph Guggenheim visited Joe Roth , successor to recently ousted Jeffrey Katzenberg as chairman of Walt Disney Studios , shortly afterward . Roth was pleased and embraced the idea of a sequel . Disney had recently begun making direct @-@ to @-@ video sequels to its successful features , and Roth wanted to handle the Toy Story sequel this way , as well . Prior releases , such as 1994 's Aladdin sequel , The Return of Jafar , had returned an estimated $ 100 million in profits . 
 Initially , everything regarding the sequel was uncertain at first : whether stars Tom Hanks and Tim Allen would be available and affordable , what the story premise would be , and even whether the film would be computer @-@ animated at Pixar or traditionally at Walt Disney Feature Animation . Lasseter regarded the project as a chance to groom new directing talent , as top choices were already immersed in other projects ( Andrew Stanton in A Bug 's Life and Pete Docter in early development work for a film that would eventually become Monsters , Inc . ) . Instead , Lasseter turned to Ash Brannon , a young directing animator on Toy Story whose work he admired . Brannon , a CalArts graduate , joined the Toy Story team in 1993 . Disney and Pixar officially announced the sequel in a press release on March 12 , 1997 . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Lasseter 's intention with a sequel was to respect the original film and create that world again . The story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting , how a toy would feel if it were not played with by a child or , worse , a child growing out of a toy . Brannon suggested the idea of a yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact . The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of A Tin Toy Christmas , an original half @-@ hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in 1990 . The obsessive toy collector named Al McWhiggin , who had appeared in a draft of Toy Story but was later expunged , was inserted into the film . Lasseter claimed that Al was inspired by himself . 
 Secondary characters in Woody 's set were inspired by 1950s cowboy shows for children , such as Howdy Doody and Hopalong Cassidy . The development of Jessie was kindled by Lasseter 's wife Nancy , who pressed him to include a strong female character in the sequel , one with more substance than Bo Peep . The scope for the original Toy Story was basic and only extended over two residential homes , whereas Toy Story 2 has been described by Unkrich as something " all over the map " . 
 To make the project ready for theaters , Lasseter would need to add 12 minutes or so of material and strengthen what was already there . The extra material would be a challenge , since it could not be mere padding — it would have to feel as if it had always been there , an organic part of the film . With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away , Lasseter called Stanton , Docter , Joe Ranft , and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend . There , he hosted what he called a " story summit " , a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days . 
 Back at the office that Monday , Lasseter assembled the company in a screening room and pitched the revised version of Toy Story 2 from exposition to resolution . Story elements were recycled from the original drafts of the first Toy Story . The original film 's original opening sequence featured a Buzz Lightyear cartoon playing on television , which evolved into the Buzz Lightyear video game that would be shown in the opening Toy Story 2 . A deleted scene from Toy Story , featuring Woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can , was incorporated in a milder form for depicting Woody 's fear of losing Andy . The idea of a squeak @-@ toy penguin with a broken squeaker also resurfaced from an early version of Toy Story . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 As the story approached the production stage in early 1997 , it was unclear whether Pixar would produce the film , as the entire team of 300 was busy working on A Bug 's Life for a 1998 release . The Interactive Products Group , with a staff of 95 , had its own animators , art department , and engineers . Under intense time pressure , they had put out two successful CD @-@ ROM titles the previous year — The Toy Story Animated <unk> and The Toy Story Activity Center . Between the two products , the group had created as much original animation as there was in Toy Story itself . Steve Jobs made the decision to shut down the computer games operation and the staff became the initial core of the Toy Story 2 production team . 
 Before the switch from direct @-@ to @-@ video to feature film , the Toy Story 2 crew had been on its own , placed in a new building that was well @-@ separated from the rest of the company by railroad tracks . " We were just the small film and we were off playing in our sandbox , " co @-@ producer Karen Jackson said . Lasseter looked closely at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout . The film reused digital elements from Toy Story but , true to the company 's " prevailing culture of perfectionism , [ ... ] it reused less of Toy Story than might be expected " . Character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements . The team freely borrowed models from other productions , such as Geri from Pixar 's 1997 short Geri 's Game , who became the Cleaner in Toy Story 2 . Supervising animator Glenn McQueen inspired the animators to do spectacular work in the short amount of time given , assigning different shots to suit each animators ' strengths . 
 Whilst producing Toy Story , the crew was careful in creating new locations , working within available technology at that time . By production on Toy Story 2 , technology had advanced farther to allow more complicated camera shots than were possible in the first film . In making the sequel , the team at Pixar did not want to stray too far from the first film 's look , but the company had developed a lot of new software since the first feature had been completed . To achieve the dust visible after Woody is placed on top of a shelf , the crew was faced with the challenge of animating dust , an incredibly difficult task . After much experimentation , a tiny particle of dust was animated and the computer distributed that image throughout the entire shelf . Over two million dust particles are in place on the shelf in the completed film . 
 = = = Controversy and troubled production = = = 
 Disney became unhappy with the pace of the work on the film and demanded in June 1997 that Guggenheim be replaced as producer , and Pixar complied . As a result , Karen Jackson and Helene Plotkin , associate producers , moved up into the roles of co @-@ producers . Lasseter would remain fully preoccupied with A Bug 's Life until it wrapped in the fall . Once available , he took over directing duties and added Lee Unkrich as co @-@ director . Unkrich , also fresh from supervising editor duties on A Bug 's Life , would focus on layout and cinematography , while Brannon would be credited as co @-@ director . 
 In November 1997 , Disney executives Roth and Peter Schneider viewed the film 's story reels , with some finished animation , in a screening room at Pixar . They were impressed with the quality of work and became interested in releasing Toy Story 2 in theaters . In addition to the unexpected artistic caliber , there were other reasons that made the case for a theatrical release more compelling . The economics of a direct @-@ to @-@ video Pixar release were not working as well as hoped thanks to the higher salaries of the crew . After negotiations , Jobs and Roth agreed that the split of costs and profits for Toy Story 2 would follow the model of a newly created five @-@ film deal — but Toy Story 2 would not count as one of the five films . Disney had bargained in the contract for five original features , not sequels , thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise . Jobs gathered the crew and announced the change in plans for the film on February 5 , 1998 . 
 The work done on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 when one of the animators , while routinely clearing some files , accidentally started a deletion of the root folder of the Toy Story 2 assets on Pixar 's internal servers . Associate technical director Oren Jacobs was one of the first to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress . They shut down the file servers but had lost 90 % of the last two years of work , and the backups were found to have failed some time previously . The film was saved when technical director <unk> Susman , who had been working from home to take care of her newborn child , revealed she had backups of the assets on her home computer . The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work , allowing the film to proceed . 
 Many of the creative staff at Pixar were not happy with how the sequel was turning out . Lasseter , upon returning from the European promotion of A Bug 's Life , watched the development reels and agreed that it was not working . Pixar met with Disney , telling them that the film would have to be redone . Disney disagreed , and noted that Pixar did not have enough time to remake the film before its established release date . Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state , and asked Lasseter to take over the production . Lasseter agreed , and recruited the first film 's creative team to redevelop the story . To meet Disney 's deadline , Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months . 
 Unkrich , concerned with the dwindling amount of time remaining , asked Jobs whether the release date could be pushed back . Jobs explained that there was no choice , presumably in reference to the film 's licensees and marketing partners , who were getting toys and promotions ready . Brannon focused on development , story and animation , Lasseter was in charge of art , modeling and lighting , and Unkrich oversaw editorial and layout . Since they met daily to discuss their progress with each other ( they wanted to ensure they were all progressing in the same direction ) , the boundaries of their responsibilities overlapped . 
 As was common with Pixar features , the production became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer . Still , Toy Story 2 , with its highly compressed production schedule , was especially trying . While hard work and long hours were common to the team by that point ( especially so to Lasseter ) , running flat @-@ out on Toy Story 2 for month after month began to take a toll . The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators , and repetitive strain injuries for others . Catmull would later disclose that " a full third of the staff " ended up with some form of RSI by the time the film was finished . Pixar did not encourage long hours , and , in fact , set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime . Employees ' self @-@ imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints , and were especially common to younger employees . In one instance , an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and , in a mental haze , forgot the baby in the back seat of his car in the parking lot . " Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst , the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard , " wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch .

 Toy Story 2 : An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack is the original score soundtrack album to Toy Story 2 . Although out of print in the U.S. , the CD is available in the U.S. as an import and all but one song is available digitally . 
 All songs written and composed by Randy Newman . 
 Randy Newman wrote two new songs for Toy Story 2 as well as the complete original score : 
 " When She Loved Me " – performed by Sarah McLachlan : Used for the flashback montage in which Jessie experiences being loved , forgotten , then abandoned by her owner , Emily . The song was nominated at the Academy Awards in 2000 for Best Original Song , though the award went to Phil Collins for " You 'll Be in My Heart " from another Disney animated film Tarzan . 
 " Woody 's Roundup " – performed by Riders in the Sky : Theme song for the " Woody 's Roundup " TV show , and also used in the end @-@ credit music . 
 The film carried over one song from Toy Story , " You 've Got a Friend in Me , " sung at different points during the film by Tom Hanks and Robert Goulet .

 Pixar showed the completed film at CalArts on November 12 , 1999 , in recognition of the school 's ties with Lasseter and more than 40 other alumni who worked on the film . The students were captivated . The film held its official premiere the next day at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles — the same venue as Toy Story 's — and was released across the United States on November 24 , 1999 . The film 's initial theatrical and video releases include Luxo Jr . , Pixar 's first short film released in 1986 , starring Pixar 's titular mascot . Before Luxo Jr . , a message states : " In 1986 Pixar Animation Studios produced their first film . This is why we have a hopping lamp in our logo " .

 Reviewers found the film to be a sequel that managed to equal or even outshine the original . " Toy Story 2 does what few sequels ever do , " The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed . " Instead of essentially remaking an earlier film and deeming it a sequel , the creative team , led by director John Lasseter , delves deeper into their characters while retaining the fun spirit of the original film " . 
 Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100 % of critics gave the film a positive review based on 163 reviews , with an average score of 8 @.@ 6 / 10 . The film is No. 27 on Rotten Tomatoes ' list of " Best Rated Films " , and is the third best rated animated film . Rotten Tomatoes summarizes the critical consensus with " The rare sequel that arguably improves on its predecessor , Toy Story 2 uses inventive storytelling , gorgeous animation , and a talented cast to deliver another rich moviegoing experience for all ages . " The film also holds an 88 / 100 on Metacritic , indicating " Universal acclaim " . CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare " A + " grade .

 John Day Fossil Beds National Monument is a U.S. National Monument in Wheeler and Grant counties in east @-@ central Oregon . Located within the John Day River basin and managed by the National Park Service , the park is known for its well @-@ preserved layers of fossil plants and mammals that lived in the region between the late Eocene , about 45 million years ago , and the late Miocene , about 5 million years ago . The monument consists of three geographically separate units : Sheep Rock , Painted Hills , and Clarno . 
 The units cover a total of 13 @,@ 944 acres ( 5 @,@ 643 ha ) of semi @-@ desert shrublands , riparian zones , and colorful badlands . About 184 @,@ 000 people frequented the park in 2014 to engage in outdoor recreation or to visit the Thomas Condon Paleontology Center or the James Cant Ranch Historic District . 
 Before the arrival of Euro @-@ Americans in the 19th century , the John Day basin was frequented by Sahaptin people who hunted , fished , and gathered roots and berries in the region . After road @-@ building made the valley more accessible , settlers established farms , ranches , and a few small towns along the river and its tributaries . Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the fossils in the region since 1864 , when Thomas Condon , a missionary and amateur geologist , recognized their importance and made them known globally . Parts of the basin became a National Monument in 1975 . 
 Averaging about 2 @,@ 200 feet ( 670 m ) in elevation , the monument has a dry climate with temperatures that vary from summer highs of about 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) to winter lows below freezing . The monument has more than 80 soil types that support a wide variety of flora , ranging from willow trees near the river to grasses on alluvial fans to cactus among rocks at higher elevations . Fauna include more than 50 species of resident and migratory birds . Large mammals like elk and smaller animals such as raccoons , coyotes , and voles frequent these units , which are also populated by a wide variety of reptiles , fish , butterflies , and other creatures adapted to particular niches of a mountainous semi @-@ desert terrain . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument consists of three widely separated units — Sheep Rock , Painted Hills , and Clarno — in the John Day River basin of east @-@ central Oregon . Located in rugged terrain in the counties of Wheeler and Grant , the park units are characterized by hills , deep ravines , and eroded fossil @-@ bearing rock formations . To the west lies the Cascade Range , to the south the <unk> Mountains , and to the east the Blue Mountains . Elevations within the 13 @,@ 944 @-@ acre ( 5 @,@ 643 ha ) park range from 2 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 500 feet ( 610 to 1 @,@ 370 m ) . 
 The Clarno Unit , the westernmost of the three units , consists of 1 @,@ 969 acres ( 797 ha ) located 18 miles ( 29 km ) west of Fossil along Oregon Route 218 . The Painted Hills Unit , which lies about halfway between the other two , covers 3 @,@ 132 acres ( 1 @,@ 267 ha ) . It is situated about 9 miles ( 14 km ) northwest of Mitchell along Burnt Ranch Road , which intersects U.S. Route 26 west of Mitchell . These two units are entirely within Wheeler County . The remaining 8 @,@ 843 acres ( 3 @,@ 579 ha ) of the park , the Sheep Rock Unit , are located along Oregon Route 19 and the John Day River upstream of the unincorporated community of Kimberly . This unit is mostly in Grant County , although a small part extends into Wheeler County . The Sheep Rock Unit is further subdivided into the Mascall Formation Overlook , Picture Gorge , the James Cant Ranch Historic District , Cathedral Rock , Blue Basin , and the Foree Area . Some of these are separated from one another by farms , ranches , and other parcels of land that are not part of the park . 
 The park headquarters and main visitor center , both in the Sheep Rock Unit , are 122 miles ( 196 km ) northeast of Bend and 240 miles ( 390 km ) southeast of Portland by highway . The shortest highway distances from unit to unit within the park are Sheep Rock to Painted Hills , 45 miles ( 72 km ) ; Painted Hills to Clarno , 75 miles ( 121 km ) , and Clarno to Sheep Rock , 81 miles ( 130 km ) . 
 The John Day River , a tributary of the Columbia River , flows generally west from the Strawberry Mountains before reaching the national monument . It turns sharply north between the Mascall Formation Overlook and Kimberly , where the North Fork John Day River joins the main stem . Downstream of Kimberly , the river flows generally west to downstream of the unincorporated community of Twickenham , and generally north thereafter . Rock Creek enters the river at the north end of Picture Gorge . Bridge Creek passes through Mitchell , then north along the eastern edge of the Painted Hills Unit to meet the John Day downstream of Twickenham . Intermittent streams in the Clarno Unit empty into Pine Creek , which flows just beyond the south edge of the unit and enters the John Day upstream of the unincorporated community of Clarno . 
 = = History = = 
 Early inhabitants of north @-@ central Oregon included Sahaptin @-@ speaking people of the Umatilla , Wasco , and Warm Springs tribes as well as the Northern Paiutes , speakers of a Uzo @-@ Aztecan ( Shoshonean ) language . All were hunter @-@ gatherers competing for resources such as elk , huckleberries , and salmon . Researchers have identified 36 sites of related archeological interest , including rock shelters and cairns , in or adjacent to the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument . Most significant among the prehistoric sites are the Picture Gorge pictographs , consisting of six panels of rock art in the canyon at the south end of the Sheep Rock Unit . The art is of undetermined origin and age but is " centuries old " . 
 The John Day basin remained largely unexplored by non @-@ natives until the mid @-@ 19th century . Lewis and Clark noted but did not explore the John Day River while traveling along the Columbia River in 1805 . John Day , for whom the river is named , apparently visited only its confluence with the Columbia in 1812 . In 1829 , Peter Skene Ogden , working for the Hudson 's Bay Company ( HBC ) , led a company of explorers and fur trappers along the river through what would later become the Sheep Rock Unit . John Work , also of the HBC , visited this part of the river in 1831 . 
 In the 1840s , thousands of settlers , attracted in part by the lure of free land , began emigrating west over the Oregon Trail . Leaving drought , worn @-@ out farms , and economic problems behind , they emigrated from states like Missouri , Illinois , and Iowa in the Midwest to Oregon , especially the Willamette Valley in the western part of the state . After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin , a fraction of these newcomers abandoned the Willamette Valley in favor of eastern Oregon . Some established villages and engaged in subsistence farming and ranching near streams . Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from The Dalles on the Columbia River to gold mines at Canyon City in the upper John Day valley . By the late 1860s , the route became formalized as The Dalles Military Road , which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock . Clashes between natives and non @-@ natives and the desire of the U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro @-@ Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to reservations , including three in north @-@ central Oregon : Warm Springs , Burns Paiute , and Umatilla . 
 In 1864 , a company of soldiers sent to protect mining camps from raids by Northern Paiutes discovered fossils in the Crooked River region , south of the John Day basin . One of their leaders , Captain John M. Drake , collected some of these fossils for Thomas Condon , a missionary pastor and amateur geologist who lived in The Dalles . Recognizing the scientific importance of the fossils , Condon accompanied soldiers traveling through the region . He discovered rich fossil beds along Bridge Creek and near Sheep Rock in 1865 . Condon 's trips to the area and his public lectures and reports about his finds led to wide interest in the fossil beds among scientists such as Edward Drinker Cope of the Academy of Natural Sciences . One of them , paleontologist <unk> C. Marsh of Yale , accompanied Condon on a trip to the region in 1871 . Condon 's work led to his appointment in 1872 as Oregon 's first state geologist and to international fame for the fossil beds . Specimens from the beds were sent to the Smithsonian Institution and other museums worldwide , and by 1900 more than 100 articles and books had been published about the John Day Fossil Beds . During the first half of the 20th century , scientists such as John C. Merriam , Ralph Chaney , Frank H. Knowlton , and Alonzo W. Hancock continued work in the fossil beds , including those discovered near Clarno in about 1890 . 
 Remote and arid , the John Day basin near the fossil beds was slow to attract homesteaders . The first settler in what became the Sheep Rock Unit is thought to have been Frank Butler , who built a cabin along the river in 1877 . In 1881 , Eli Casey Officer began grazing sheep on a homestead claim in same general area . His son Floyd later lived there with his family and sometimes accompanied Condon on his fossil hunts . In 1910 , James and Elizabeth Cant bought 700 acres ( 280 ha ) from the Officer <unk> and converted it to a sheep ranch , which was eventually expanded to a sheep @-@ and @-@ cattle ranch of about 6 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 400 ha ) . 
 Merriam , a University of California paleontologist who had led expeditions to the region in 1899 and 1900 , encouraged the State of Oregon to protect the area . In the early 1930s the state began to buy land for state parks at Picture Gorge , the Painted Hills , and Clarno that later became part of the national monument . In 1951 the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry established Camp Hancock , a field school for young students of geology , paleontology , and other sciences , on public lands surrounded by what would later become the Clarno Unit . In 1974 Congress authorized the National Park Service to establish the national monument , and President Gerald R. Ford signed the authorization . After the State of Oregon had completed the land transfer of the three state parks to the federal government , the monument was officially established on October 8 , 1975 . 
 The Cant Ranch House and associated land and outbuildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the 200 @-@ acre ( 81 ha ) James Cant Ranch Historic District in 1984 . After the monument opened in 1975 , the ranch house served as headquarters for all three units . In 2005 , the lower floor of the ranch house was opened to the public ; it features exhibits about the cultural history of the region . The Thomas Condon Paleontology Center , a $ 7 @.@ 5 million museum and visitor center at the Sheep Rock Unit , also opened in 2005 . Among the center 's offerings are displays of fossils , murals depicting life in the basin during eight geologic times ranging from about 45 million to about 5 million years ago , and views of the paleontology laboratory . 
 In March 2011 , the Park Service installed two webcams at the Sheep Rock Unit . Both transmit continuous real @-@ time images ; one shows the paleontology lab at the Condon Center and the other depicts Sheep Rock and nearby features . In June 2011 , work was finished on a new ranger residence in the Painted Hills Unit that makes the unit almost carbon @-@ neutral . Solar panels generate enough electricity to power the house as well as the ranger 's electric vehicle , on loan from its manufacturer for a year . The project is part of ongoing efforts to make the whole park carbon @-@ neutral .

 The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument lies within the Blue Mountains physiographic province , which originated during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous , about 118 to 93 million years ago . Northeastern Oregon was assembled in large blocks ( exotic terranes ) of Permian , Triassic , and Jurassic rock shifted by tectonic forces and accreted to what was then the western edge of the North American continent , near the Idaho border . By the beginning of the Cenozoic era , 66 million years ago , the Blue Mountains province was uplifting ( that is , was being pushed higher by tectonic forces ) , and the Pacific Ocean shoreline , formerly near Idaho , had shifted to the west . 
 Volcanic eruptions about 44 million years ago during the Eocene deposited lavas accompanied by debris flows ( lahars ) atop the older rocks in the western part of the province . Containing fragments of shale , siltstone , conglomerates , and breccias , the debris flows entombed plants and animals caught in their paths ; the remnants of these ancient flows comprise the rock formations exposed in the Clarno Unit . Preserved in the Clarno Nut Beds are fossils of tropical and subtropical nuts , fruits , roots , branches , and seeds . The Clarno Formation also contains bones , palm leaves longer than 24 inches ( 61 cm ) , avocado trees , and other subtropical plants from 50 million years ago , when the climate was warmer and wetter than it is in the 21st century . Large mammals that inhabited this region between 50 and 35 million years ago included browsers such as <unk> and <unk> , scavengers like the <unk> , as well as <unk> and other predators . Eroded remnants of the Clarno stratovolcanoes , once the size of Mount Hood , are still visible near the monument , for example Black Butte , White Butte , and other buttes near Mitchell . 
 After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided , they were replaced about 36 million years ago by eruptions from volcanoes to the west , in the general vicinity of what would become the Cascade Range . The John Day volcanoes , as they are called , emitted large volumes of ash and dust , much of which settled in the John Day basin . As with the earlier Clarno debris flows , the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region . Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene ( about 20 million years ago ) , the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color . Laid down on top of the Clarno Strata , the younger John Day Strata consist of several distinct groups of layers . The lowermost contains red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit . The layer above it is mainly pea @-@ green clay . On top of the pea @-@ green layer are buff @-@ colored layers . Fossils found in the John Day Strata include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 species of mammals , including dogs , cats , <unk> , saber @-@ toothed tigers , horses , camels , and rodents . The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils , as well as turtles , opossums , and large pigs . More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these strata , such as hydrangea , peas , hawthorn , and mulberry , as well as pines and many deciduous trees . One of the notable plant fossils is the Metasequoia ( dawn redwood ) , a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20th century . 
 After another period of erosion , a series of lava eruptions from fissures across northeastern Oregon , southeastern Washington , and western Idaho inundated much of the Blue Mountain province with liquid basalt . <unk> in the middle Miocene between 17 and 12 million years ago , more than 40 separate flows contributing to the Columbia River Basalt Group have been identified , the largest of which involved up to 400 cubic miles ( 1 @,@ 700 km3 ) of lava . The most prominent of these formations within the monument is the Picture Gorge Basalt , which rests above the John Day Strata . 
 Subsequent ashfall from eruptions in the Cascade Range in the late Miocene contributed to the Mascall Strata , layers of stream @-@ deposited volcanic tuffs laid atop the Picture Gorge Basalt . Preserved in the Mascall are fossils of animals such as horses , camels , rhinoceroses , bears , pronghorn , deer , weasels , raccoons , cats , dogs , and sloths . These fauna thrived in the monument 's open woodland and savannah between 15 and 12 million years ago . The fossils of oak , sycamore , maple , ginkgo , and elm trees reflect the area 's cool climate during this time period . 
 The last major eruption occurred in the late Miocene , about 7 million years ago . The resulting stratum , the Rattlesnake Formation , lies on top of the Mascall and is capped by an ignimbrite . The Rattlesnake stratum has fossils of mastodons , camels , rhinoceroses , the ancestors of dogs , lions , bears , and horses , and others that grazed on the grasslands of the time . Two fossilized teeth found recently in the Rattlesnake stratum near Dayville are the earliest record of beaver , Castor californicus , in North America . The beaver teeth , which are about 7 million years old , have been scheduled for display at the Condon Center . 
 The monument contains extensive deposits of well @-@ preserved fossils from various periods spanning more than 40 million years . Taken as a whole , the fossils present an unusually detailed view of plants and animals since the late Eocene . In addition , analysis of the John Day fossils has contributed to <unk> ( the study of Earth 's past climates ) and the study of evolution . 
 Paleontologists at the monument find , describe the location of , and collect fossil @-@ bearing rocks from more than 700 sites . They take them to the paleontology laboratory at the visitor center , where the fossils are stabilized , separated from their rock matrix , and cleaned . The fossil specimens are then catalogued , indexed , stored in climate @-@ controlled cabinets , and made available for research . In addition to preparing fossils , the paleontologists coordinate the monument 's basic research in paleobotany and other scientific areas and manage the fossil museum in the visitor center .

 Average precipitation , limited by the rain shadow effects of the Cascade Range and the <unk> Mountains , varies from 9 to 16 inches ( 230 to 410 mm ) a year . In winter , much of the precipitation arrives as snow . 
 Weather data for the city of Mitchell , near the Painted Hills Unit , show that July and August are the warmest months , with an average high of 86 ° F ( 30 ° C ) and an average low of 52 ° F ( 11 ° C ) . January is the coldest month , when highs average 42 ° F ( 6 ° C ) and lows average 24 ° F ( − 4 ° C ) . The highest recorded temperature in Mitchell was 107 ° F ( 42 ° C ) in 1972 , and the lowest was − 27 ° F ( − 33 ° C ) in 1983 . May is generally the wettest month , when precipitation averages 1 @.@ 65 inches ( 42 mm ) .

 More than 80 soil types support a wide variety of flora within the monument . These soils stem from past and present geologic activity as well as ongoing additions of organic matter from life forms on or near the surface . Adapted to particular soil types and surface conditions , these plant communities range from riparian vegetation near the river to greasewood and <unk> on the alluvial fans to plants such as hedgehog cactus in rocky outcrops at high elevation . Important to many of these communities is a black cryptobiotic crust that resists erosion , stores water , and fixes nitrogen used by the plants . The crust is composed of algae , lichens , mosses , fungi , and bacteria . Other areas of the monument have little or no flora . Volcanic tuffs and <unk> that lack essential nutrients support few microorganisms and plants . Likewise , hard rock surfaces and steep slopes from which soils wash or blow away tend to remain bare . 
 Native grasses thrive in many parts of the monument despite competition from western junipers , <unk> rye , Dalmatian toadflax , cheatgrass , and other invasive species . <unk> in the park include basin <unk> , Idaho fescue , Thurber 's needlegrass , Indian ricegrass , and bottlebrush <unk> , among others . Native grasses that form sod in parts of the monument include Sandberg 's bluegrass and other bluegrass species . Reed canary grass , if mowed , also forms sod along stream banks . 
 Limited by their need for water , trees such as willows , alders , and ponderosa pines are found only near the monument 's streams or springs . <unk> bushes and shrubs like mountain mahogany are found in places where moisture collects near rock slides and ledges . Elsewhere long @-@ rooted rabbitbrush has adapted to survive in dry areas . Other shrubs with adaptive properties include greasewood , sagebrush , shadscale , broom snakeweed , antelope bitterbrush , and purple sage . Western junipers , which have extensive root systems , thrive in the dry climate ; in the absence of periodic fires they tend to displace grasses and sagebrush and to create relatively barren landscapes . The Park Service is considering controlled burning to limit the junipers and to create open areas for <unk> that re @-@ sprout from their roots after a fire . 
 Wildflowers , which bloom mainly in the spring and early summer , include <unk> , golden bee plant , dwarf purple monkey flower , and sagebrush mariposa lily at the Painted Hills Unit . Munro 's globemallow , lupines , yellow fritillary , hedgehog cactus , and Applegate 's Indian paintbrush are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units .

 Birds are the animals most often seen in the monument . Included among the more than 50 species observed are red @-@ tailed hawks , American kestrels , great horned owls , common nighthawks , and great blue herons . Geese nest in the park each summer , and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights . California quail , chukar partridges , and mourning doves are also common . Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor 's center include rufous hummingbirds , Say 's <unk> , yellow warblers , western meadowlarks , and American goldfinches . Visitors on trails may encounter canyon wrens , mountain bluebirds , mountain chickadees , black @-@ billed magpies , and other birds . 
 Large animals that frequent the park include elk , deer , cougar , and pronghorn . Beaver , otter , mink , and raccoons are found in or near the river . Coyotes , bats , and badgers are among the park 's other mammals . Predators hunt smaller animals such as the rabbits , voles , mice , and shrews found in the park 's grasslands and sagebrush @-@ covered hills . Bushy @-@ tailed woodrats inhabit caves and crevices in the monument 's rock formations . Bighorn sheep , wiped out in this region in the early 20th century , were reintroduced in the Foree Area of the Sheep Rock Unit in 2010 . Many habitats in the monument support populations of snakes and lizards . Southern alligator and western fence lizards are common ; others that live here include short @-@ horned and common side @-@ blotched lizards and western skinks . Garter and gopher snakes and western yellow @-@ bellied racers frequent floodplains and canyon bottoms . Rattlesnakes , though venomous , are shy and usually flee before being seen . The springs and seeps in the park contain isolated populations of western toads , American spadefoot toads , Pacific tree frogs , and long @-@ toed salamanders . 
 A 2003 – 04 survey of the monument found 55 species of butterflies such as the common <unk> , orange sulphur , great spangled fritillary , and monarch . The monument 's other insects have not been completely inventoried . 
 The John Day River , which passes through the Sheep Rock Unit , is the longest undammed tributary of the Columbia River , although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede migratory fish travel to some degree . Chinook salmon and steelhead pass through the monument on their way to and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean . Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate warm summer river temperatures : <unk> suckers , northern pikeminnow , redside shiners , and smallmouth bass . From October through June , when the water is cooler , Columbia River redband trout and sculpin are among species that move downriver through the park . The Park Service has removed or replaced irrigation diversions along the river or Rock Creek that formerly impeded fish movement , and it is restoring riparian vegetation such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects .

 Entrance to the park and its visitor center , museums , and exhibits is free , and trails , overlooks , and picnic sites at all three units are open during daylight hours year @-@ round . No food , lodging , or fuel is available in the park , and camping is not allowed . Hours of operation for the Cant Ranch and its cultural museum vary seasonally . The Thomas Condon Paleontology Center is open every day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m except for federal holidays during the winter season from Veterans Day in November through Presidents ' Day in February . Its amenities include a fossil museum , theater , education classroom , bookstore , restrooms , and drinking fountains . There is no cell phone or pay telephone service in the monument . Water taps at picnic areas are shut down in the colder months . 
 The Sheep Rock Unit has eight trails ranging in length from 300 feet ( 91 m ) at the Mascall Formation Overlook to 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) at Blue Basin . Four trails of a quarter @-@ mile to 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) long cross parts of the Painted Hills Unit . At the Clarno Unit , three separate quarter @-@ mile trails begin at a parking lot along Oregon Route 218 , below the face of the Clarno Palisades . Many of the trails have interpretive signs about the history , geology , and fossils of the region , and three trails — Story in Stone at the Sheep Rock Unit , and Painted Cove and Leaf Hill at the Painted Hills Unit — are accessible by wheelchair . Visitors are asked to stay on the trails and off bare rock and hardpan to avoid damage to fossils and fragile soils . 
 Ranger @-@ led events at the monument have historically included indoor and outdoor talks , showings of an 18 @-@ minute orientation film , hikes in Blue Basin , Cant Ranch walking tours , and astronomy programs at the Painted Hills Unit . These events are free and most do not require reservations . Specific times for the activities are available from rangers at the monument . For students and teachers , the Park Service offers programs at the monument as well as fossil kits and other materials for classroom use . 
 Pets are allowed in developed areas and along hiking trails but must be leashed or otherwise restrained . Horses are not allowed on hiking trails , in picnic areas , or on bare rock exposures in undeveloped areas of the monument . Digging , disturbing , or collecting any of the park 's natural resources , including fossils , is prohibited . Fossil theft is an ongoing problem . No mountain biking is allowed on monument land , although the Malheur National Forest east of Dayville has biking trails . Fishing is legal from monument lands along the John Day River for anyone with an Oregon fishing license . Rafting on the John Day River is seasonally popular , although the favored runs begin at or downstream of Service Creek and do not pass through the monument . Risks to monument visitors include extremely hot summer temperatures and icy winter roads , two species of venomous rattlesnakes , two species of poisonous spiders , ticks , scorpions , <unk> , and poison ivy . 
 = Demon core = 
 The demon core was a 6 @.@ 2 @-@ kilogram ( 14 lb ) , 89 @-@ millimetre @-@ diameter ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) subcritical mass of plutonium that was involved in two criticality accidents . It briefly went supercritical in two separate accidents at the Los Alamos laboratory in 1945 and 1946 , and resulted in the acute radiation poisoning and subsequent deaths of scientists Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin . After these incidents the spherical plutonium core was referred to as the " demon core " . 
 = = Manufacturing and early history = = 
 The demon core ( like the second core used in the bombing of Nagasaki ) was a solid 6 @.@ 2 @-@ kilogram ( 14 lb ) 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch @-@ diameter ( 89 mm ) sphere . It consisted of three parts : two plutonium @-@ gallium hemispheres and a ring , designed to keep neutron flux from " jetting " out of the joined surface between the hemispheres during implosion . The core of the device used in the Trinity nuclear test at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range in July did not have such a ring . 
 The refined plutonium was shipped from the Hanford Site in Washington state to the Los Alamos Laboratory ; an inventory document dated August 30 shows Los Alamos had expended " HS @-@ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ; R @-@ 1 " ( the components of the Trinity and Nagasaki bombs ) and had in its possession " HS @-@ 5 , 6 ; R @-@ 2 " , finished and in the hands of quality control . Material for " HS @-@ 7 , R @-@ 3 " was in the Los Alamos metallurgy section , and would also be ready by September 5 ( it is not certain whether this date allowed for the unmentioned " HS @-@ 8 " ' s fabrication to complete the fourth core ) . The metallurgists used a plutonium @-@ gallium alloy , which stabilized the δ phase allotrope of plutonium so it could be hot pressed into the desired spherical shape . As plutonium was found to corrode readily , the sphere was then coated with nickel . 
 On August 10 , Major General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , wrote to General of the Army George C. Marshall , the Chief of Staff of the United States Army , to inform him that : 
 The next bomb of the implosion type had been scheduled to be ready for delivery on the target on the first good weather after August 24th , 1945 . We have gained 4 days in manufacture and expect to ship the final components from New Mexico on August 12th or 13th . Providing there are no unforeseen difficulties in manufacture , in transportation to the theatre or after arrival in the theatre , the bomb should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after August 17th or 18th . 
 Marshall added an annotation , " It is not to be released on Japan without express authority from the President " , as President Harry S. Truman was waiting to see the effects of the first two attacks . On August 13 , the third bomb was scheduled . It was anticipated that it would be ready by August 16 to be dropped on August 19 . This was pre @-@ empted by Japan 's surrender on August 15 , 1945 , while preparations were still being made for it to be couriered to Kirtland Field . The third core remained at Los Alamos . 
 = = First incident = = 
 The core , assembled , was designed to be at " -5 cents " , or 5 percent below critical mass . In this state it takes but a small amount of additional criticality @-@ enhancing factors to cause the core to become supercritical , and then prompt critical , " a transient @-@ state of extremely rapid power increase " . Fortunately these factors are not common in the environment ; they are circumstances like the compression of the solid metallic core – which would eventually be the method used to explode the bomb , the addition of more nuclear material or provision of an external reflector which would reflect outbound neutrons back into the core . The experiments conducted at Los Alamos leading to the two fatal accidents were designed to guarantee that the core was indeed close to the critical point by arranging such reflectors and seeing how much ( or little ) neutron reflection was required to approach supercriticality . 
 On August 21 , 1945 , the plutonium core produced a burst of neutron radiation that led to Harry Daghlian 's death . Daghlian , a physicist , made a mistake while performing neutron reflector experiments on the core . He was working alone ; a security guard , Private Robert J. <unk> , was seated at a desk 10 to 12 feet ( 3 to 4 m ) away . The core was placed within a stack of neutron @-@ reflective tungsten carbide bricks and the addition of each brick moved the assembly closer to criticality . While attempting to stack another brick around the assembly , Daghlian accidentally dropped it onto the core and thereby caused the core to go well into supercriticality , a self @-@ sustaining critical chain reaction . Despite quick action in moving the brick off the assembly , Daghlian received a fatal dose of radiation . He died 25 days later from acute radiation poisoning . 
 = = Second incident = = 
 On May 21 , 1946 , physicist Louis Slotin and seven other Los Alamos personnel were in a Los Alamos laboratory conducting another experiment to verify the exact point at which a subcritical mass ( core ) of fissile material could be made critical by the positioning of neutron reflectors . Slotin , who was leaving Los Alamos , was showing the technique to Alvin C. Graves , who would use it in a final test before the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests scheduled a month later at Bikini Atoll . It required the operator to place two half @-@ spheres of beryllium ( a neutron reflector ) around the core to be tested and manually lower the top reflector over the core via a thumb hole on the top . As the reflectors were manually moved closer and farther away from each other , scintillation counters measured the relative activity from the core . Allowing them to close completely could result in the instantaneous formation of a critical mass and a lethal power excursion . Under Slotin 's unapproved protocol , the only thing preventing this was the blade of a standard straight screwdriver , manipulated by the scientist 's other hand . Slotin , who was given to bravado , became the local expert , performing the test on almost a dozen occasions , often in his trademark blue jeans and cowboy boots , in front of a <unk> of observers . Enrico Fermi reportedly told Slotin and others they would be " dead within a year " if they continued performing it . 
 On the day of the accident , Slotin 's screwdriver slipped outward a fraction of an inch while he was lowering the top reflector , allowing the reflector to fall into place around the core . Instantly there was a flash of blue light and a wave of heat across Slotin 's skin ; the core had become supercritical , releasing an intense burst of neutron radiation estimated to have lasted about a half second . Slotin quickly twisted his wrist , flipping the top shell to the floor . The heating of the core and shells stopped the criticality within seconds of its initiation , while Slotin 's reaction prevented a recurrence and ended the accident . The position of Slotin 's body over the apparatus also shielded the others from much of the neutron radiation , but he received a lethal dose of 1 @,@ 000 rad ( 10 Gy ) neutron / 114 rad ( 1 @.@ 14 Gy ) gamma in under a second and died nine days later from acute radiation poisoning . The nearest person to Slotin , Graves , who was watching over Slotin 's shoulder and was thus partially shielded by him , received a high but non @-@ lethal radiation dose . Graves was hospitalized for several weeks with severe radiation poisoning and developed chronic neurological and vision problems as a result of the exposure . He died 20 years later of a heart attack . This heart attack may have been caused by hidden complications from radiation exposure , but its cause could also have been genetic , as his father had died from the same cause . 
 There have been five studies done of the amount of radiation each person involved received in the accident ; these are the latest , dated 1978 , from a table in this reference : 
 Two machinists in another part of the building were not treated : Paul Long and another , unidentified . 
 After these incidents the core , originally known as " Rufus " , was referred to as the " demon core " . Hands @-@ on criticality experiments were stopped , and remote @-@ control machines were designed by Schreiber , one of the survivors , to perform such experiments with all personnel at a quarter @-@ mile distance . 
 = = Operation Crossroads = = 
 The core was intended to be used in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests , but after the criticality accident , time was needed for its radioactivity to decline . It was therefore scheduled for the third test of the series , provisionally named Charlie , but this was cancelled due to the unexpected level of radioactivity after the underwater Baker test and the inability to decontaminate the target warships . It was later melted down and the material reused in another core . 
 = William Blackstone = 
 Sir William Blackstone SL KC ( 10 July 1723 – 14 February 1780 ) was an English jurist , judge and Tory politician of the eighteenth century . He is most noted for writing the Commentaries on the Laws of England . Born into a middle @-@ class family in London , Blackstone was educated at Charterhouse School before matriculating at Pembroke College , Oxford in 1738 . After switching to and completing a Bachelor of Civil Law degree , he was made a Fellow of All Souls , Oxford on 2 November 1743 , admitted to Middle Temple , and called to the Bar there in 1746 . Following a slow start to his career as a barrister , Blackstone became heavily involved in university administration , becoming accountant , treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 and Senior Bursar in 1750 . Blackstone is considered responsible for completing the Codrington Library and Warton Building , and simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college . On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and instead embarked on a series of lectures on English law , the first of their kind . These were massively successful , earning him a total of £ 453 ( £ 63 @,@ 000 in 2016 terms ) , and led to the publication of An Analysis of the Laws of England in 1756 , which repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works . 
 On 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first Vinerian Professor of English Law , immediately embarking on another series of lectures and publishing a similarly successful second treatise , titled A Discourse on the Study of the Law . With his growing fame , Blackstone successfully returned to the bar and maintained a good practice , also securing election as Tory Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Hindon on 30 March 1761 . In February 1766 he published the first volume of Commentaries on the Laws of England , considered his magnum opus — the completed work earned Blackstone £ 14 @,@ 000 ( £ 1 @,@ 756 @,@ 000 in 2016 terms ) . After repeated failures , he successfully gained appointment to the judiciary as a Justice of the Court of King 's Bench on 16 February 1770 , leaving to replace Edward Clive as a Justice of the Common Pleas on 25 June . He remained in this position until his death , on 14 February 1780 . 
 Blackstone 's legacy and main work of note is his Commentaries . Designed to provide a complete overview of English law , the four @-@ volume treatise was repeatedly republished in 1770 , 1773 , 1774 , 1775 , 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783 . Reprints of the first edition , intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest , were published until the 1870s in England and Wales , and a working version by Henry John Stephen , first published in 1841 , was reprinted until after the Second World War . Legal education in England had stalled ; Blackstone 's work gave the law " at least a veneer of scholarly respectability " . William Searle Holdsworth , one of Blackstone 's successors as Vinerian Professor , argued that " If the Commentaries had not been written when they were written , I think it very doubtful that [ the United States ] , and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the common law . " In the United States , the Commentaries influenced Alexander Hamilton , John Marshall , James Wilson , John Jay , John Adams , James Kent and Abraham Lincoln , and remain frequently cited in Supreme Court decisions . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 William 's father , Charles Blackstone , was a silk mercer from Cheapside , the son of a wealthy apothecary . He became firm friends with Thomas Bigg , a surgeon and the son of Lovelace Bigg , a gentleman from Wiltshire . After Bigg 's sister Mary came to London , Charles eventually persuaded her to marry him in 1718 . This was not seen as a good match for her , but the couple lived happily and had four sons , three of whom lived into adulthood . Charles ( born August 1719 ) and Henry ( May 1722 ) , both became fellows of New College , Oxford and took holy orders . Their last son , William , was born on 10 July 1723 , five months after Charles ' death in February . 
 Although Charles and Mary Blackstone were members of the middle class rather than landed gentry , they were particularly prosperous . Tax records show Charles Blackstone to have been the second most prosperous man in the parish in 1722 , and death registers show that the family had several servants . This , along with Thomas Bigg 's assistance to the family following Charles ' death , helps explain the educational upbringing of the children . William Blackstone was sent to Charterhouse School in 1730 , nominated by Charles Wither , a relative of Mary Blackstone . William did well there , and became head of the school by age 15 . However , after Charles ' death the family fortunes declined , and after Mary died ( 5 January 1736 ) the family 's resources largely went to meet unpaid bills . William was able to remain at Charterhouse as a " poor scholar " , having been named to that position in June 1735 after being nominated by Sir Robert Walpole . 
 Blackstone revelled in Charterhouse 's academic curriculum , particularly the Latin poetry of Ovid and Virgil . He began to attract note as a poet at school , writing a 30 @-@ line set of rhyming couplets to celebrate the wedding of James <unk> , the headmaster . He also won a silver medal for his Latin verses on John Milton , gave the annual Latin oration in 1738 , and was noted as having been the favourite student of his masters . On 1 October 1738 , taking advantage of a new scholarship available to Charterhouse students , Blackstone matriculated at Pembroke College , Oxford . 
 = = Oxford = = 
 = = = Study = = = 
 There are few surviving records of Blackstone 's undergraduate term at Oxford , but the curriculum of Pembroke College had been set out in 1624 , and Prest notes that it was probably still followed in 1738 , so Blackstone would have studied Greek , science , logic , rhetoric , philosophy , mathematics , geography and poetry . Blackstone was particularly good at Greek , mathematics and poetry , with his notes on William Shakespeare being included in George Steevens ' 1781 edition of Shakespeare 's plays . Many of Blackstone 's undergraduate texts survive , and they include few legal texts , instead being wide @-@ ranging ; politics , current affairs , poetry , geometry and controversial theological texts . The last element is understandable , given his family 's theological interests , but the more surprising element is the sheer number of texts he owned given his relative poverty as a student . 
 On 9 July 1740 , after only a year and a half as a Bachelor of Arts student , Blackstone was admitted to study for a Bachelor of Civil Law degree , civil law being the only legal area recognised by his university . This degree course was seven years long , the first two " supposedly devoted to a broad course of reading in humane studies " , which allowed him to study his own interests . On 20 November 1741 he was admitted to the Middle Temple , the first step on the road to becoming a barrister , but this imposed no obligations and simply allowed a legal career to be an option . At the time there was no proper legal education system , and Blackstone read ( in his own time ) Coke on Littleton , the works of Henry Finch , and related legal tracts . 
 In addition to his formal studies , Blackstone published a collection of poetry which included the draft version of The Lawyer to his Muse , his most famous literary work . In 1743 he published Elements of Architecture and An Abridgement of Architecture , two treatises on the rules governing the art of construction . His next work ( 1747 ) was The Pantheon : A Vision , an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world . It depicts a narrator 's walking dream through the buildings of various religions , which are all ( other than Christianity ) depicted in a negative light . This followed his election as a Fellow of All Souls , Oxford on 2 November 1743 , and his call to the Bar by the Middle Temple on 28 November 1746 . 
 His call to the Bar saw Blackstone begin to alternate between Oxford and London , occupying chambers in Pump Court but living at All Souls College . As the central courts only sat for three months of the year , the rest of his time was spent on Assize when his work at All Souls permitted . He regularly acted as a law reporter ; his personal notes on cases start with Hankey v Trotman ( 1746 ) . Blackstone 's barrister practice began slowly ; his first case in the Court of King 's Bench was in 1748 , and he had only 6 additional motions there through 1751 . Two appearances in the Court of Chancery are also noted , and he is known to have been consulted in Roger Newdigate 's long @-@ running lawsuit there , but his early court appearances are infrequent . This is considered to have been due to bad luck , with his call to the Bar occurring at the same time as the massive contraction in business by the central courts , along with his singular lack of connections due to his status as an orphan from the middle class ; he was described as " unrecognised and unemployed " . He filled his time by acting as counsel for Oxford , and from May 1749 with his election as Recorder of Wallingford . 
 = = = University administration = = = 
 While dividing his time , Blackstone became an administrator at All Souls , securing appointment as accountant , treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 . Completion of the Codrington Library and Warton Building , first started in 1710 and 1720 respectively but not built until 1748 , is attributed to his work . In 1749 he became Steward of the Manors , and in 1750 was made Senior Bursar . Records show a " perfectionist zeal " in organising the estates and finances of All Souls , and Blackstone was noted for massively simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college . In 1750 Blackstone completed his first legal tract , An Essay on Collateral <unk> , which dealt with those claiming a familial tie to the founder or All Souls in an attempt to gain preeminence in elections . Completion of his Doctor of Civil Law degree , which he was awarded in April 1750 , admitted him to Convocation , the governing body of Oxford , which elected the two burgesses who represented it in the House of Commons , along with most of the university officers . With this and with his continuing work at the university , Blackstone announced on 3 July 1753 his intentions to " no longer attend the Courts at Westminster , but to pursue my Profession in a Way more agreeable to me in all respects , by residing at Oxford [ and ] to <unk> upon this Resolution a Scheme which I am told may be beneficial to the University as well as myself " , which was to give a set of lectures on the common law – the first lectures of that sort in the world . 
 This was not entirely out of benevolence ; according to Prest , Blackstone was likely aware that an Oxford alumnus , Charles Viner , was planning to endow a professorship of English law . The Regius Professorship of Civil Law had also become vacant in 1753 ; despite support from Lord Mansfield , Blackstone had been rejected in favour of Robert Jenner , widely considered Blackstone 's lesser intellectually but a far greater political mind . In addition , a private lecture series would be extremely lucrative . While his All Souls fellowship gave him £ 70 a year , records show that the lecture series brought him £ 116 , £ 226 and £ 111 a year respectively from 1753 to 1755 – a total of £ 453 ( £ 63 @,@ 000 in 2016 terms ) . A prospectus was issued on 23 June 1753 , and with a class of approximately 20 students , the first set of lectures were completed by July 1754 . Despite Blackstone 's limited oratory skills and a speaking style described by Jeremy Bentham as " formal , precise and affected " , Blackstone 's lectures were warmly appreciated . The second and third series were far more popular , partly due to the then unusual use of printed handouts and lists of suggested reading . No copies of these handouts exist , but Alexander Popham , later a close friend of Blackstone , attended the lectures and made notes , which survive . These show Blackstone 's attempts to reduce English law to a logical system , with the division of subjects later being the basis for his Commentaries . 
 Following his lecture series , Blackstone became more prominent in convocation and other university activities . Oxford and Cambridge at the time had a strange system of law ; due to their unique natures , they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs , based on the civil law . With his appointment as assessor ( or chief legal officer ) of the Chancellor 's Court , Blackstone became far more involved in the university 's peculiar legal system , and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759 , mainly dealing with small claims of debt . He also wrote a manual on the Court 's practice , and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections , as well as visibility , which aided his legal career significantly . This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry , Friendship : An Ode , in 1756 . 
 In 1756 Blackstone published the first of his full legal texts , the 200 page An Analysis of the Laws of England . Published by the Clarendon Press , the treatise was intended to demonstrate the " Order , and principal Divisions " of his lecture series , and a structured introduction to English law . Prest calls this " a marked advance on any previous introduction to English law . . including constitutional , civil and criminal law , public and private law , substantive law and procedure , as well as some introductory jurisprudential content " . The initial print run of 1 @,@ 000 copies almost immediately sold out , leading to the printing of three more 1 @,@ 000 @-@ book lots over the next three years , which all sold out . A fifth edition was published in 1762 , and a sixth , edited to take into account Blackstone 's Commentaries on the Laws of England , in 1771 . Because of the success of the Commentaries , Prest remarks that " relatively little scholarly attention has been paid to this work " ; at the time , however , it was hailed as " an elegant performance . . calculated to facilitate this branch of knowledge " . 
 = = = Vinerian Professor of English Law = = = 
 On 8 March 1758 , the group executing Charles Viner 's will reported to Convocation that Viner recommended creating a Chair of English Law , with a £ 200 salary . After much debate , this position was created , and on 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first Vinerian Professor of English Law . On 24 October he gave his first lecture , to " a crowded audience " ; the text was soon printed and published as A Discourse on the Study of the Law . The lecture was tremendously popular , being described as a " sensible , spirited and manly exhortation to the study of the law " ; the initial print run sold out , necessitating the publication of another 1 @,@ 000 copies , and it was used to preface later versions of the Analysis and the first volume of the Commentaries . Within the university , however , Blackstone was not as popular . As soon as the lecture series opened , an anonymously written open letter was published charging that Blackstone had " violated the Statutes of the University , by arbitrarily changing the Day appointed for reading his solemn Lectures " . Blackstone suffered a nervous breakdown soon after the first lecture , and on 24 November he launched a suit in the Chancellor 's Court against " William Jackson of the City of Oxford Printer " for £ 500 damages , justified by Jackson " printing and publishing a scandalous <unk> notoriously reflecting on the Character of him the said William Blackstone " . Jackson had refused to reveal who ordered the anonymous pamphlet , leading to the suit , but it evidently did not proceed further . 
 This suit , along with the struggle over the Vinerian Professorship and other controversies , damaged his reputation within the university , as evidenced by his failure to win election as Vice Warden in April 1759 , losing to John White . Prest attributes Blackstone 's unpopularity to specific personality traits , saying his " determination ... in pursuit of causes to which he committed himself could irritate as well as intimidate those of a more relaxed disposition . While quick to take offence at perceived slights on his own character and motives , he could also show surprising indifference to the effect his words and actions might have on others " . This marked the beginning of his break with Oxford , which coincided with his growing influence outside the university . In 1759 Lord Bute , Prince George 's official tutor , requested copies of Blackstone 's lectures , which he forwarded . Later that year Blackstone was paid £ 200 by the Prince , who became an " appreciative , loyal , and soon to be incomparably influential patron " . This patronage , and Blackstone 's purchase of a set of chambers in the Inner Temple , also transferring to that Inn , were significant steps in his departure from Oxford . In 1759 Blackstone published another two works , The Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest , with other authentic Instruments , described as a " major piece of pioneering scholarship " leading to Blackstone 's election to the Society of Antiquaries in February 1761 , and A Treatise on the Law of Descents in Fee Simple , which was later used , almost verbatim , as chapters 14 and 15 of the Commentaries .

 With sponsorship from the Prince of Wales and his success with the Analysis , Blackstone began work as a barrister , although he kept up his lecture series at Oxford . By 1760 he had become " a very eminent figure indeed in the world of letters " , and his legal practice grew as a result . Although not considered a great barrister of the period , he maintained a steady flow of cases , primarily in the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas . On the death of the third Earl of Abingdon , Blackstone was retained as counsel for the executors and trustees to oversee the family 's attempts to pay off debts and meet other obligations . On 5 May 1761 he married Sarah Clitherow , a member of a family of lesser gentry from Middlesex . Their first child , William Bertie Blackstone , born 21 August 1762 , did not survive to adulthood . Seven more children were born ; Henry , James , Sarah , Mary , Philippa , William , Charles , and George , who also died in childhood . The Blackstones had a large estate in Wallingford , including 120 acres ( 46 ha ) of pastureland around the River Thames and the right of advowson over St Peter 's Church . 
 In February 1761 Blackstone was considered as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon . After consultation with friends , he agreed to this prospect – at the same time refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland . On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon , and took his seat . This did not limit his legal work , initially , with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way , and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time . Court records show him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King 's Bench soon after his election , and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins , a copyright case , <unk> v Bath , an important case on international law , and R v d <unk> , acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV 's newly appointed cross @-@ dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom . 
 With this increase in his practice , Blackstone also saw an increase in his out @-@ of @-@ court work , writing opinions and recommendations for various Oxford colleges , the MP Jonathan <unk> and the fourth Earl of Abingdon , who paid him to draft several private Acts of Parliament . In April 1765 Blackstone began to actively seek judicial appointment . In December 1761 he asked Lord Shelburne , a patron , for his assistance in gaining appointment as Chief Justice of Chester , writing again in July 1762 to " prevail upon Lord Bute to recommend me to his Majesty 's Notice " , anticipating an upcoming vacancy in the Court of Common Pleas . Parliamentary service was considered a " desirable if never absolutely essential qualification for would @-@ be English judges " , something that did not necessarily bode well for Blackstone . Naturally inarticulate and reticent , he was an infrequent and " indifferent " speaker during his first session of Parliament , speaking only 14 times in seven years . His chosen career did lend him to politics , in that the lawyers in the House of Commons were often added to select committees to provide them with technical expertise in drafting legislation . He again applied for a judicial post in December 1762 , after an opening in the Exchequer of Pleas came up , but lost to George Perrott , a leading Exchequer barrister . The next five vacancies also failed to go to Blackstone , after the appointment of Lord Camden ( a Whig ) as Lord Chancellor . 
 = = = Commentaries on the Laws of England = = = 
 In 1765 Blackstone announced his resignation from the Vinerian Chair , effective after his 1766 lectures . These were divided into two 14 @-@ lecture series , on " private wrongs " and " public wrongs " delivered between 12 February and 24 April . At this point Blackstone had published nothing new since A Treatise on the Law of Descents in Fee Simple in 1759 . The decision to resign was most likely due to the increasing demands of his legal practice and the reduced profit from the lectures , which , after peaking at £ 340 in 1762 , dropped to £ 239 a year later and to £ 203 for the final round of lectures in 1765 @-@ 6 . In response , Blackstone decided to publish a new book – Commentaries on the Laws of England . The first volume was published in November 1765 , bringing the author £ 1 @,@ 600 – the full work would eventually bring in over £ 14 @,@ 000 . Owen <unk> described Volume I as " masterly " , noting that " Mr Blackstone is perhaps the first who has treated the body of the law in a liberal , elegant and constitutional manner . A vein of good sense and moderation runs through every page " . Every copy was sold within six months , and the second and third volumes , published in October 1766 and June 1768 , received a similar reception . The fourth and final volume appeared in 1770 , dealing with Criminal Law . With the financial success of the Commentaries , Blackstone moved in 1768 from his London property in Carey Fields to No. 55 Lincoln 's Inn Fields . Neighbours included the Sardinian ambassador , Sir Walter Rawlinson , Lord Northington , John Morton and the Third Earl of Abingdon , making it an appropriate house for a " great and able Lawyer " . 
 Blackstone 's treatise was republished in 1770 , 1773 , 1774 , 1775 , 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783 . Reprints of the first edition , intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest , were published until the 1870s in England and Wales , and a working version by Henry John Stephen , first published in 1841 , was reprinted until after the Second World War . The first American edition was produced in 1772 ; prior to this , over 1 @,@ 000 copies had already been sold in the Thirteen Colonies . 
 = = = Judge = = = 
 Even after the publication of the Commentaries , Blackstone 's chances of judicial appointment remained slim . While he was old enough , experienced enough and widely respected , the presence of Lord Camden as Lord Chancellor and Blackstone 's lack of aristocratic patrons at the time hindered his chances . In January 1770 , however , Lord Grafton 's government began to fall , with Camden resigning on 17 January and Solicitor @-@ General John Dunning , following him . George III appointed Lord North as Prime Minister , and North picked Charles Yorke as Lord Chancellor . Yorke 's death on 20 January , after holding the position for less than three days , left several important legal positions within the government open . As such , Blackstone , now MP for Westbury , was apparently approached to become Solicitor @-@ General ; he refused , not wanting to deal with the complicated duties attached to the position . 
 On 9 February 1770 – apparently with the intervention of the King , and possibly Lord Mansfield – Blackstone became a Justice of the Common Pleas , succeeding Edward Clive , and was made a Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law on 12 February . After only four days it was announced that Joseph Yates was to move to the Common Pleas , and Blackstone was again sworn in as a judge , this time of the Court of King 's Bench . This was apparently due to Yates ' poor health ; Lord Mansfield ran a busy court as Lord Chief Justice , and it was felt that his transfer to the Common Pleas was for the best . Others commented that it was instead due to political and judicial disagreement , with Yates unwilling to stomach the changes which Mansfield made to English law . Blackstone sat regularly as a judge , despite bouts of ill health , and also served on various circuit courts . Prest describes him as an " exceptionally careful , conscientious and well @-@ respected judge . . his judgments ranging between narrowly framed technicalities [ and ] broad statements of public commentary " . He was , however , considered a poor trial judge , being reversed on appeal more frequently than any of his peers . 
 Blackstone returned to the Common Pleas on 25 June 1770 , having spent less than six months in the King 's Bench ; Jeremy Bentham asserted that this was due to Mansfield 's having Blackstone removed similarly to his removal of Yates . Bentham asserted that in the King 's Bench , Blackstone was " always in hot water " , and that there was " <unk> " between the two ; Bentham 's account is considered dubious because historically , Mansfield and Blackstone had an excellent relationship , with the third volume of the Commentaries describing Mansfield as " a judge , whose masterly acquaintance with the law of nations was known and revered by every state in Europe " . There is only one recorded King 's Bench case , R v Proprietors of Birmingham Canal Navigation , in which Blackstone and Mansfield disagreed . 
 In the Common Pleas , Blackstone operated under a civil jurisdiction rather than a mixed civil and criminal one . This played to his strengths , and many of his decisions are considered farsighted ; the principle in Blaney v Hendricks , for example , that interest is due on an account where money was lent , which anticipated Section 3 of the Law Reform ( Miscellaneous Provisions ) Act 1934 . Blackstone 's decision in <unk> 's Case was later repeated by Lord Denning in Falmouth Boat Construction Co v Howell in 1950 . 
 = = Death = = 
 Blackstone had long suffered from gout , and by November 1779 also had a nervous disorder which caused dizziness , obesity , high blood pressure and possibly diabetes . By 3 February 1780 he was too weak to write , and after " some Days almost totally insensible " , he died on 14 February . After a service conducted by Bishop Barrington on 22 February , Blackstone was buried in the family vault under St Peter 's Church , Wallingford . His estate at his death was worth less than £ 15 @,@ 000 ; therefore William Eden secured a £ 400 annual royal pension for Sarah Blackstone . The initial reaction to Blackstone 's death was subdued , but in December 1780 the Fellows of All Souls College agreed that " a Statue be erected to the memory of Sr W Blackstone deceased " . Constructed by John Bacon , the life @-@ sized statue of Blackstone in his judicial robes cost £ 539 , and has rested in the Codrington Library since 1872 . His brother @-@ in @-@ law , James Clitherow , also published two volumes of his law reports which added £ 1 @,@ 287 to the estate , and in 1782 the Biographical History of Sir William Blackstone appeared . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Blackstone 's primary legacy is his written work , specifically the Commentaries on the Laws of England . Demand for reprinted , abridged and translated versions was " almost inexhaustible " in the 18th and 19th centuries , although the Commentaries ' emphasis on the sovereignty of Parliament drew ire . Alexis de Tocqueville described Blackstone as " an inferior writer , without liberality of mind or depth of judgment " . Other commentators differ ; one described him as " the core element in the British Enlightenment " , comparing him to Montesquieu , <unk> and Voltaire . Academics have said that the Commentaries were crucial in changing English Law from a system based on actions to a system of substantive law . At the time of publication , the common law of England was still , in some ways , in its infancy , with people uncertain as to what the law was . The Commentaries helped to solidify legal thinking . At the same time , legal education had stalled , and Blackstone 's work gave the Law " at least a veneer of scholarly respectability " . William Searle Holdsworth , one of Blackstone 's successors as Vinerian Professor , argued that " if the Commentaries had not been written when they were written , I think it very doubtful that [ the United States ] , and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the [ common ] law " . 
 The Commentaries had a particular influence in the United States ; James Iredell , an original Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States wrote that the Commentaries were " Books admirably calculated for a young Student , and indeed may instruct the most learned . . Pleasure and Instruction go hand in hand " . When the Commentaries were first printed in North America , 1 @,@ 400 copies were ordered for Philadelphia alone . Academics have also noted the early reliance of the Supreme Court on the Commentaries , probably due to a lack of US legal tradition at that time . Robert Ferguson notes that " all our formative documents – the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution , the Federalist Papers and the seminal decisions of the Supreme Court under John Marshall – were drafted by attorneys steeped in Sir William Blackstone 's Commentaries on the Laws of England . So much was this the case that the Commentaries rank second only to the Bible as a literary and intellectual influence on the history of American institutions " . Even today , the Commentaries are cited in Supreme Court decisions between 10 and 12 times a year . 
 Within United States academia and practise , as well as within the judiciary , the Commentaries had a substantial impact ; with the scarcity of law books on the frontier , they were " both the only law school and the only law library most American lawyers used to practise law in America for nearly a century after they were published " . Blackstone had drawn up a plan for a dedicated School of Law , and submitted it to the University of Oxford ; when the idea was rejected he included it in the Commentaries . It is from this plan that the modern system of American law schools comes . Subscribers to the first edition of Blackstone , and later readers who were profoundly influenced by it , include James Iredell , John Marshall , James Wilson , John Jay , John Adams , James Kent and Abraham Lincoln . In advocating for American independence , Alexander Hamilton cited Blackstone for the proposition that " the law of nature , ' which , being coequal with mankind , and dictated by God himself , is , of course , superior in obligation to any other . It is binding over all the globe , in all countries , and at all times . No human laws are of any validity , if contrary to this ; and such of them as are valid , derive all their authority , <unk> , or immediately , from this original . ' " 
 In the early 1920s the American Bar Association presented a statue of Blackstone to the English Bar Association , however , at the time , the sculpture was too tall to be placed in the Royal Courts of Justice . The sculpture , designed by Paul Wayland Bartlett was eventually cast in Europe and presented back to the United States for display . Congress approved the placement of the sculpture in Washington , D.C. on 15 March 1943 , and appropriated $ 10 @,@ 000 for the installation . The bronze statue is a nine @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) standing portrait of Blackstone wearing judicial robes and a long curly wig , holding a copy of Commentaries . It is placed on a tall granite base and stands on Constitution Avenue & 3rd Street NW . The town of Blackstone , Virginia is named after him . 
 = = = Blackstone 's Ratio = = = 
 Among the most well @-@ known of Blackstone 's contributions to judicial theory is his own statement of the principle that it " is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer " . 
 While this argument originates at least as far back as Genesis 18 : 23 – 32 in the Bible , as well as versions by Maimonides and Sir John Fortescue , Blackstone 's analysis is the one picked up by Benjamin Franklin and others , so that the term has become known as " Blackstone 's Ratio " . 
 As John Adams , having studied Blackstone , put it : 
 Blackstone 's Ratio is a maxim of English law , having been established as such within a few decades of Blackstone 's work being published . It is also cited in courts and law in the US , and is strongly emphasised to American law students .

 = Chongqing model = 
 The " Chongqing model " refers to a series of social and economic policies adopted in the Chinese megalopolis of Chongqing . It is most closely associated with Bo Xilai , who served as the city 's Communist Party secretary from 2007 to 2012 , though some policies were put in place by Bo 's predecessors . 
 The Chongqing model was characterized in part by increased state control and the promotion of a neo @-@ leftist ideology . It involved a sweeping and sometimes extrajudicial campaign against organized crime , and increased the security and police presence in the city . As a means of addressing declining public morality , Bo launched a " red culture " movement to promote Maoist @-@ era socialist ethics . On the economic front , he actively courted foreign investment and focused on manufacturing for domestic consumption . The Chongqing model was also characterized by massive public works programs , subsidized housing for the poor , and social policies intended to make it easier for rural citizens to move to the city . 
 The Chongqing model represented an alternative model of development which diverged from the policies favored by the reformist faction led by Party general secretary Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao . When Bo Xilai was removed from his posts in the spring of 2012 , authorities began a campaign to reverse several of the policies that characterized the Chongqing model , including by cracking down on expressions of " red culture " . Individuals , who believed they had been wrongly persecuted under the anti @-@ corruption campaign , also began seeking legal redress . 
 = = Background = = 
 Bo Xilai , son of Communist Party icon Bo Yibo , was assigned as Communist Party secretary for Chongqing during the 17th Party Congress in October 2007 . His predecessor , Wang Yang , was reassigned to helm the Communist Party in Guangdong province . At the time , Chongqing was reeling from problems such as air and water pollution , unemployment , poor public health , and complications from the Three Gorges Dam . Prior to the appointment , Bo had served as Minister of Commerce . Bo was initially reluctant to assume the Chongqing post , which was widely viewed as a demotion ; he had hoped to become vice @-@ premier instead . 
 Although Bo was initially unhappy about his reassignment as Communist Party secretary in Chongqing , he soon resolved to use his new position as a staging ground for a return to higher national office . Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine @-@ member Politburo Standing Committee ( PSC ) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012 , when seven of the nine members of the PSC — including General Secretary Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao — were expected to retire . The transition would be an opportunity for the ambitious Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership , likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang , head of the party 's security apparatus . 
 Bo used his leadership of Chongqing to pioneer the " Chongqing Model " — a systematic set of social and economic policies intended to address diverse challenges facing modern China . The Chongqing model represented a rebuke of the policies favored by the reformist faction dominated by Wen Jiabao and Hu Jintao . It is also frequently contrasted with the Guangdong model championed by Bo 's predecessor and political opponent Wang Yang . Whereas the Chongqing model placed emphasized the role of the state in economic and social life , the Guangdong model is characterized by comparatively liberal economic and political policies . 
 = = = Crackdown on organized crime = = = 
 Bo 's tenure in Chongqing was dominated by a protracted war ostensibly against organized crime and corruption known as " Striking Black " ( " Da Hei " ) . Since 2009 , an estimated 5 @,@ 700 people were arrested in the sweeping campaign that ensnared not only criminals , but also businessmen , members of the police force , judges , government officials , and political adversaries who were accused of corruption or criminal collaboration . The campaign was overseen by police chief and vice mayor Wang Lijun , whom Bo had worked with previously in Liaoning province . Reports from the Jamestown Foundation suggest the initiative was given approval by general secretary Hu Jintao , and Bo struck a careful balance between claiming credit for the campaign and praising Beijing 's leadership in the crackdown on crime . 
 The Striking Black campaign earned Bo national recognition and widespread popularity in Chongqing — all the more because of the city ’ s reputation as a center for criminal activity . The apparent success of Bo 's campaign raised Bo 's national and international profile and resulted in calls for a nationwide campaign based on his experiences in Chongqing . Through the campaign , Bo gained the support of a number of powerful members of the Politburo Standing Committee , including Wu Bangguo , Jia Qinglin , Li Changchun , Xi Jinping and Zhou Yongkang , all of whom visited Chongqing or praised Bo 's achievements sometime between 2010 and 2011 . 
 Bo 's measures were criticized for neglecting due process and contributing to the erosion of the rule of law . " By all accounts , " wrote Stanley Lubman in The Wall Street Journal , the campaign " involved misuse of both the courts and the police . " Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities , with an estimated 1 @,@ 000 being sent to forced labor . Lawyers for the accused were reportedly intimidated ; one lawyer was sentenced to 18 months in prison . Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions . Moreover , many of those targeted in the campaign were not criminals , but businessmen and political rivals whose assets were reportedly seized in order to help pay for Bo ’ s popular social housing programs . The Wall Street Journal reported estimates that $ 11 billion was seized through the campaign . Li Jun , a fugitive businessman , told The Financial Times that Chongqing security forces seized his $ 700 million real estate business and tortured him as retaliation for attempting to purchase land that was also sought by the government . One <unk> was sentenced to a year in labor camp for criticizing Bo ’ s alleged abuse of the court system during the campaign . 
 The campaign to combat crime and maintain political stability also involved the launch of a major electronic surveillance operation in the city . Wang Lijun , Bo ’ s police chief , served as the architect of the state @-@ funded project , which was described in official media as a " comprehensive package bugging system covering telecommunications to the Internet . " The system involved wiretaps , eavesdropping , and monitoring of internet communications . According the New York Times , the eavesdropping operations did not only target local criminals , but also the communications of top Chinese leaders . In August 2011 , a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti @-@ corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo ’ s orders . The revelation about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection , and contributed to Bo ’ s downfall in 2012 . 
 = = = Social policies = = = 
 A cornerstone of Bo ’ s Chongqing model was a series of egalitarian social policies aimed at lessening the gap between rich and poor and easing the rural @-@ urban divide . Bo promoted the notion of pursuing " red GDP " — an economic model embodying communist egalitarianism — and suggested that , if economic development were analogous to ' baking a cake ' , then the primary task should be to divide the cake fairly rather than building a larger cake . 
 To that end , the city reportedly spent $ 15 @.@ 8 billion on public apartment complexes for use by recent college graduates , migrant workers , and low @-@ income residents . Bo aimed to provide housing for 2 @.@ 4 million residents by 2012 . Residents whose incomes were under 3 @,@ 000 yuan ( $ 480 ) per month would be eligible to rent apartments for three years , with an option to buy thereafter . Huang <unk> , who served as mayor under Bo Xilai , indicated in 2010 that the subsidized housing project was " designed to free up more money for people to consume and drive the economy , ” and noted that it would borrow elements from Singapore 's Housing Development Board . 
 In 2007 , the cities of Chongqing and Chengdu were selected to run pilot projects intended to mitigate the rural @-@ urban divide and ease integration of rural residents into the cities . Under China ’ s hukou registration system , citizens are classified as either rural or urban — a distinction that determines not only where they may live , but also affects educational opportunities , taxation , property rights , and so on . Of Chongqing ’ s 32 million residents , only 27 % held urban hukou certificates as of 2007 . The 2007 project made it easier for rural residents to obtain urban status — a policy intended not only to help balance inequality , but also to enable the government to develop underused rural land . Under Bo ’ s leadership , Chongqing established " land exchanges " where rural villages could earn credits for maximizing farmland . Bo pledged to move three million rural residents into urban areas . 
 Bo 's populist approach to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes , which saw over 8 @,@ 000 taxi drivers take to the streets for two days in protests over high fees , unregulated competition , and rising fuel charges . Similar protests in China are frequently suppressed — sometimes forcefully — with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation . Bo 's government instead held televised roundtable dialogues with the protesters and citizens , and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union . His handling of situation earned him praise as a comparatively progressive leader . A businessman who was reportedly involved in organizing the strike was later sentenced on 20 years in prison for disrupting transport and gangsterism . 
 The Chongqing model also involved a major campaign to " green " the city through a tree @-@ planting initiative . The city reportedly imported millions of trees — many of them <unk> — as part of the campaign . The cost of the greening initiative was estimated to be as high as 10 billion yuan . 
 = = = Red culture movement = = = 
 During his time in Chongqing , Bo initiated a series of Maoist @-@ style campaigns to revive " red culture " and improve public morale . The initiative included the promotion of Maoist quotes , " singing red songs " ( <unk> ) , revolutionary television programming and operas , and initiatives to encourage students to work in the countryside , akin to the way students were required to do during the Down to the Countryside Movement of the Cultural Revolution . 
 Prior to the 60th Anniversary of the People 's Republic of China celebrations , for instance , Bo sent out " red text messages " to the city 's 13 million cellphone users . According to Xinhua News Agency , Bo 's text messages are usually quotes from Mao 's Little Red Book , and include phrases such as " I like how Chairman Mao puts it : The world is ours , we will all have to work together , " and " responsibility and seriousness can conquer the world , and the Chinese Communist Party members represent these qualities . " Bo and his team of municipal administrators also raised new Mao statues in Chongqing , while providing social housing to the city 's less well @-@ off . Some scholars have characterized this as an example of the revival of Maoism in the Chinese Communist ethos . 
 In 2011 , Bo and the city 's Media Department initiated a " Red Songs campaign " that demanded every district , government department , commercial enterprise , educational institution , and state radio and TV station begin " singing red songs " praising the achievements of the Communist Party of China . Bo pledged to reinvigorate the city with Marxist ideals reminiscent of the Mao era . 
 Reactions to the red culture movement were divided . Bo ’ s revival of Mao @-@ era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society , and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo @-@ leftists . One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign , saying , " When I sing red songs , I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs … To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time . " A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times " We know these songs from our youth . We grew up with revolutionary spirit and we want to pass that on to our children . ” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country ’ s strong economy . 
 However , the campaign was unsettling to others — particularly the intelligentsia . A 57 @-@ year @-@ old lawyer told The Washington Post , " I saw the beatings of the teachers by the Red Guards . It was horrible … Young people may not recognize it . But for us who lived through it , how can we possibly sing ? " An academic quoted in The Daily Telegraph described the mandatory campaign as akin to being " drowned in a Red sea . " In September 2009 , a mid @-@ level official in the city committed suicide after being pressured to organize his work unit to participate in the red songs campaign . The official , Xie <unk> , reportedly disagreed with the campaign , which evoked painful memories of the Cultural Revolution . Bo ’ s critics and opponents derisively referred to him as " little Mao , " with some expressing concern about the resemblance of the red culture campaign to the Cultural Revolution . 
 = = = Economic policies = = = 
 Another major component of Bo ’ s Chongqing model concerned the city ’ s economic policies . Just as he had done in Liaoning province , Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city , lowered corporate income tax rates ( 15 % compared to the 25 % national average ) , and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization . He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption , rather than export @-@ led growth . The Chongqing model also placed emphasis on the importance of state @-@ owned enterprises ; in 2010 , Bo stressed that China " [ needs ] to have things that are state @-@ owned . " 
 During his tenure , Chongqing reported annual GDP growth far exceeding the national average . In 2008 , for instance , nationwide GDP growth was reported at 8 % , while Chongqing reported 14 @.@ 3 % ; the same year , foreign trade rose by 28 % , and bank loans were up 29 % . Several major corporations built or greatly expanded their manufacturing operations in Chongqing , including Hewlett @-@ Packard , Foxconn , Ford motors , and BASF . 
 Bo 's model of economic growth won national and international praise , but it also had its detractors . In particular , the so @-@ called " red GDP " of subsidized infrastructure , housing and public works projects were criticized for running up the city ’ s budget deficits . A former head of a Chongqing business association told The Daily Telegraph that under Bo , " lots of officials were not getting their salaries on time , getting an IOU instead . Eventually the economy was going to break . " Chongqing received a disproportionately higher share of stimulus money from the central government in 2008 , with $ 34 billion going to the city . Political rivals such as Bo ’ s predecessor Wang Yang also suggested that economic figures such as those in Chongqing were " rigged " — artificially inflated through unnecessary construction and public works projects . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Bo Xilai 's political fortunes came to an abrupt end when his police chief , Wang Lijun , fled to the American consulate in Chengdu hoping to gain political asylum . Wang reportedly provided the consulate with information on Bo 's alleged misconduct , including his role obstructing investigations into the homicide of British citizen and Bo family associate Neil Heywood . In the fallout , Bo was removed as Chongqing party chief in March 2012 and suspended from the politburo in April 2012 . 
 Following the removal of Bo Xilai from his official positions , Chinese leaders began an effort to discredit him . On 14 March , Premier Wen Jiabao reprimanded Bo during his annual press conference . Wen called the achievements of Chongqing " significant , " but the result of " multiple administrations , " rather than just Bo himself . Wen also made numerous allusions to the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution — an indirect rebuke of Bo 's efforts to revive " red culture " . 
 Apparently wary of the associations to the Cultural Revolution , a campaign was launched cracking down on expressions of " red culture " that Bo had championed . The crypto @-@ Maoist campaign of singing red songs is also likely to be stopped . However , other aspects of the Chongqing model — in particular the egalitarian social policies , subsidized education and low @-@ income housing projects — drew grassroots and popular support . At least in this regard , the successes of the Chongqing Model are likely to be remembered and studied , according to analyst Wu Zhong . 
 Critics asserted in the aftermath of Bo 's removal that the " Striking Black " campaign against organized crime and corruption may have been policy a " political ploy designed to cast a negative light on his predecessor and political opponent , Wang Yang , and take advantage of popular resentment against corruption " . Following Bo 's removal , Chongqing 's new vice mayor He Ting signaled that the city 's security force would be overhauled . Some legal scholars and activists expressed hope that the forced labor sentences meted out under Bo might be reexamined . A collection of civil rights lawyers led by Liu Yang circulated an open letter online suggesting a review of criminal sentences under Bo 's administration . Soon thereafter , Liu was reportedly instructed to desist in these efforts by the Beijing Bureau of Legal Affairs . The Washington Post reported that several relatives of individuals detained amidst the campaign began been seeking legal counsel from prominent civil rights lawyers — including Beijing @-@ based Li Zhuang — in hopes of having the sentences overturned . The first person to petition for redress was Fang Hong , a dissident blogger who had been sent to one year in a labor camp for writing a poem mocking Bo . In May 2012 , Fang filed to have his guilty verdict overturned , and sought compensation from the court . His appeal was successful , with a Chongqing court ruling in late June 2012 that there was an insufficient evidence to justify his detention . 
 Authorities also launched investigations into the city 's spending policies , including the costly tree @-@ planting campaign . Shortly after Bo 's removal from his Chongqing party post , the city 's finance bureau and economic planning office reportedly issued an urgent notice to government and party officials in the city to " clean up " investment projects . An official with the city 's finance bureau indicated the investigation would focus on " how the money was raised , spent and managed . " However , the Wall Street Journal reported that it was " unclear whether the scrutiny of Chongqing 's spending stems from concern about potential wrongdoing or the city 's debt burden , or whether it is primarily a politically motivated attempt to attack Mr. Bo 's ' Chongqing model . ' " 
 Yang Fan , a leading " new left " scholar at China University of Political Science and Law and co @-@ author of the book The Chongqing Model , also signaled that a reassessment of the Chongqing model would be in order , saying " since a big scandal has hit Chongqing , it is imperative that we take a second look at the Chongqing Model " . 
 Bo 's downfall , and the subsequent reassessments of the Chongqing model , has been viewed by some commentators as a victory for Wang Yang 's Guangdong model . In assessing the fall @-@ out , John Wagner Givens wrote that " If there is a hope among China 's leadership , it might be Mr. Bo 's predecessor Wang Yang . While Mr. Wang may not have Bo 's populist flair , he appears to have made some real , though small , political reforms . " 
 Wu <unk> , a Chinese liberal economist , and Sun Jian , a researcher at the Communist party journal Seeking Truth , warned that vested interest blocs , such as the Gang of <unk> , should not block or unwind current reform . 
 Zhou Lian , an associate professor of philosophy at Renmin University of China , and Ai Weiwei , an artist in Beijing , have publicly criticized Bo and his Chongqing Model for being wrong and lowering trust . Li Zhuang , a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the " Striking Black " policy , said that " the Chongqing model is problematic because the city 's leaders do not follow the rule of law " . According to Andrew J. Nathan , a political scientist at Columbia University , " the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime " . Furthermore , he said , “ All the worst things you ever imagined are actually true ” and “ It ’ s not like nobody knew about this stuff , but now they know that it really is true and it ’ s as bad as it can possibly be . ” 
 Zhang <unk> , an economist and journalist , is leading a new movement and is gaining followers for a plan to add checks and balances to the Communist Party and to significantly increase welfare benefits . Populists want to remake the party to reflect Chairman Mao 's early vision . However , Mao @-@ style populism is hated by most current older Chinese leaders , and Bo , its leading advocate , was destroyed by scandal . Because of this , few commentators expect China to willingly remake itself soon . And even those within the elite prepared to discuss major changes , including the second @-@ generation " Gang of <unk> " , have an interest in protecting the status quo .

It occurs in river valleys and rugged wooded mountain ridges at heights between 1 @,@ 000 – 4 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 – 13 @,@ 100 ft ) altitude , where it nests in colonies beneath overhangs on vertical cliffs , laying three or four white eggs in an enclosed mud nest . 
 This martin has blue @-@ black upperparts with a contrasting white rump , and white underparts . It resembles its close relatives , the Asian house martin and common house martin , but unlike those species it has a black throat and black undertail . It feeds in flocks with other swallows , catching flies and other insects in flight . It is subject to predation and parasites , but its status within its limited range appears secure . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Nepal house martin was first described by British entomologist Frederic Moore in 1854 , and placed in a new genus Delichon created by Moore and American naturalist Thomas Horsfield . The specimen or its description was attributed by Moore to Brian Houghton Hodgson and early literature sometimes refers to in as Hodgson 's martin . Some older taxonomic sources such as those by S D Ripley specify the binomial author as " Hodgson = Moore in Horsfield & Moore , 1854 " . Its closest relatives are the two other members of the genus , the Asian house martin and the common house martin . This martin has a distinctive subspecies , D. n. cuttingi , described by American biologist Ernst W. Mayr in 1941 from a specimen taken near the Burma @-@ Yunnan border . White @-@ throated birds in the southern extension of the range are similar in appearance to the nominate subspecies , but because of their geographical separation are sometimes considered to be a third race , D. n. bartletti . Delichon is an anagram of the Ancient Greek term χελιδών ( chelīdōn ) , meaning " swallow " , and nipalense refers to Nepal , where the type specimen was obtained . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The nominate subspecies D. n. nipalense breeds in the Himalayas from Garhwal east through Nepal , northeastern India and Bangladesh as far as western Burma . The race D. n. cuttingi is found in northern Burma , along Burma 's border with Chinese Yunnan and in northern Tonkin , Vietnam . The Nepal house martin is largely resident , but may move to lower altitudes when not breeding , and has been occasionally recorded in northern Thailand in winter . The range in Thailand is poorly known . 
 The habitat is river valleys and wooded ridges at 1 @,@ 000 – 4 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 – 13 @,@ 100 ft ) altitude , although mainly below 3 @,@ 000 m ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . When not breeding , birds may descend as low as 350 m ( 1 @,@ 150 ft ) . The range of this species overlaps with that of the nominate subspecies of Asian house martin , although they breed at different altitudes . The height separation and the small differences in appearance seem sufficient to prevent interbreeding . 
 = = Description = = 
 The adult Nepal house martin is 13 cm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) long , mainly blue @-@ black above and white below . It has a contrasting pure white rump , the tail and upperwings are brownish @-@ black , and the underwings are grey @-@ brown . The legs and feet are brownish @-@ pink and covered with white feathers , the eyes are brown , and the bill is black . The chin is black but the extent varies clinally . In the northeast of the range , birds of the race D. n. cuttingi have black on the whole of the throat and the uppermost breast , but further west or south the black increasingly becomes restricted to the chin . There are no differences in appearance between the sexes , but the juvenile bird is less glossy and has a duskier throat and buff @-@ washed underparts . 
 The eastern form D. n. cuttingi has a wing length of 99 – 106 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 2 in ) , slightly larger than the nominate subspecies at 90 – 98 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) . Both subspecies can be distinguished from the similar Asian and common house martins by their black chin , black undertail coverts and much squarer tail . 
 This is an exceptionally fast @-@ flying martin which gives an occasional short chi @-@ i call in flight . It is otherwise is a rather quiet bird , but it has a brief three @-@ note breeding song . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The Nepal house martin breeds between March and July , with some variation in timing depending on locality , and usually raises two broods . It normally builds its nest , a deep mud bowl lined with grasses or feathers , under an overhang on a vertical cliff . Very occasionally , buildings may be used as nest sites , and in Sikkim this bird is recorded as nesting under school roofs near the <unk> Lho Wildlife Sanctuary . This martin is a colonial breeder , with colonies sometimes containing hundreds of nests . Some birds may remain at the colonies throughout the year , using the nests as a winter roost . The normal clutch is three or four plain white eggs averaging 18 @.@ 6 mm × 12 @.@ 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 73 in × 0 @.@ 50 in ) and weighing 1 @.@ 6 g ( 0 @.@ 056 oz ) . The incubation and fledging times are unknown , but are probably similar to those of the common house martin , which has an incubation period of 14 – 16 days until the eggs hatch , and a further 22 – 32 days to fledging . Both sexes build the nest , incubate the eggs and feed the chicks . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The Nepal house martin feeds on insects taken in flight , hunting along ridges or above treetops . The diet is not well known , but includes flies . This bird is gregarious , feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like the Himalayan swiftlet , or other hirundines such as the barn swallow , striated swallow or common house martin . 
 = = = Predators and parasites = = = 
 Predators of this martin have been little studied , but it was the only bird recorded in a study of the diet of the mainly insectivorous collared falconet . It is parasitised by a flea of the genus <unk> . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The Nepal house martin has a large range that does not appear to be contracting , and its numbers appear to be stable , although the population is unknown . Since the range is more than 20 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 7 @,@ 700 sq mi ) , and there are more 10 @,@ 000 mature individuals , in the absence of any large decline in distribution or numbers the species does not appear to meet the criteria to be considered vulnerable , and is currently evaluated as Least Concern . Although often localised due to the requirement for suitable cliff nesting sites , this species is fairly common in Nepal as a whole , and very common in some regions . Some earlier authors have noted this species as uncommon in Nepal . 
 = Cornish people = 
 Cornish people or Cornish ( Cornish : <unk> ) are an ethnic group associated with Cornwall , in the south west of Great Britain , administered as part of England , and a recognised national minority in the United Kingdom . The Cornish thus represent a distinct ethnic group within the UK , which can trace its roots to the ancient Britons who inhabited southern and central Great Britain before the Roman conquest , and some in the county today continue to assert a distinct identity , separately or in addition to English or British identities . Cornish identity has been adopted by migrants into Cornwall , as well as by emigrant and descendant communities from Cornwall , the latter sometimes referred to as the Cornish diaspora . Although not included as an explicit option in the UK census , the numbers of those claiming Cornish ethnic and national identity are officially recognised and recorded . 
 Throughout classical antiquity , the ancient Britons formed a series of tribes , cultures and identities in Great Britain ; the Dumnonii and Cornovii were the Celtic tribes who inhabited what was to become Cornwall during the Iron Age , Roman and post @-@ Roman periods . The name Cornwall and its demonym Cornish are derived from the Celtic Cornovii tribe . The Anglo @-@ Saxon invasion and settlement of Britain in the 5th to 6th centuries pushed Celtic culture and some Celtic peoples to the northern and western fringes of Britain . The Cornish people , who shared the Brythonic language with the Welsh and Bretons across the sea , were referred to in the Old English language as the " <unk> " meaning West Welsh . The Battle of Deorham between the Britons and Anglo @-@ Saxons is thought to have resulted in a loss of <unk> with the people of Wales . 
 The Cornish people and their Brythonic Cornish language experienced a process of anglicisation and attrition during the Medieval and early Modern Period . By the 18th century , and following the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain , the Cornish language and identity had faded , replaced by the English language and British identity . A Celtic revival during the early @-@ 20th century enabled a cultural self @-@ consciousness in Cornwall that revitalised the Cornish language and roused the Cornish to express a distinctly Celtic heritage . The Cornish language was granted official recognition under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 2002 , and in 2014 the Cornish people were recognised and afforded protection by the UK Government under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities . 
 In the 2011 census , the population of Cornwall , including the Isles of Scilly was estimated to be 532 @,@ 300 . The Cornish self @-@ government movement has called for greater recognition of Cornish culture , politics and language , and urged that Cornish people be accorded greater status , exemplified by the call for them to be one of the listed ethnic groups in the United Kingdom Census 2011 form . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Both geographic and historical factors distinguish the Cornish as an ethnic group further supported by identifiable genetic variance between the populations of Cornwall , neighbouring Devon and England as published in a 2012 Oxford University study . Throughout medieval and Early Modern Britain , the Cornish were at some points accorded the same status as the English and Welsh and considered a separate race or nation , distinct from their neighbours , with their own language , society and customs . A process of Anglicisation between 1485 and 1700 led to the Cornish adopting English language , culture and civic identity , a view reinforced by Cornish historian A. L. Rowse who said they were gradually " absorbed into the mainstream of English life " . Although " decidedly modern " and " largely retrospective " in its identity politics , Cornish and Celtic associations have advanced the notion of a distinct Cornish national and ethnic identity since the late 20th century . In the United Kingdom Census 2001 , despite no explicit " Cornish " option being available , approximately 34 @,@ 000 people in Cornwall and 3 @,@ 500 people elsewhere in the UK — a combined total equal to nearly 7 per cent of the population of Cornwall — identified themselves as ethnic Cornish by writing this in under the " other " ethnicity option . The census figures show a change in identity from West to East , in Penwith 9 @.@ 2 per cent identified as ethnically Cornish , in <unk> it was 7 @.@ 5 per cent , in Carrick 6 @.@ 6 per cent , Restormel 6 @.@ 3 per cent , North Cornwall 6 per cent , and <unk> 5 @.@ 6 per cent . <unk> of the 2001 Census data gives a figure of 154 @,@ 791 people with Cornish ethnicity living in Cornwall . 
 The Cornish have been described as " a special case " in England , with an " ethnic rather than regional identity " . Structural changes to the politics of the United Kingdom , particularly the European Union and devolution , have been the cited as the main stimulus to " a growing interest in Cornish identity and distinctiveness " in late @-@ 20th century Britain . The British are the citizens of the United Kingdom , a people who by convention consist of four national groups : the English , Northern Irish , Scots and Welsh . In the 1990s it was said that the notion that the Cornish are to be classified as a nation comparable to the English , Irish , Scots and Welsh , " has practically vanished from the popular consciousness " outside Cornwall , and that , despite a " real and substantive " identity , the Cornish " struggle for recognition as a national group distinct from the English " . However , in 2014 , after a 15 @-@ year campaign , the UK government officially recognised the Cornish as a national minority under the Council of Europe 's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities , giving the Cornish the same status as the Welsh , Scots and Irish within the UK . 
 Inhabitants of Cornwall may have multiple political allegiances , adopting mixed , dual or hyphenated identities such as " Cornish first and British second " , " Cornish and British and European " , or , like Phil Vickery ( a rugby union prop for the England national rugby union team and British and Irish Lions ) , describe themselves as " Cornish " and " English " . Meanwhile , another international rugby union player , Josh <unk> , describes himself as Cornish @-@ Fijian and Cornish not English . 
 A survey by Plymouth University in 2000 found that 30 % of children in Cornwall felt " Cornish , not English " . A 2004 survey on national identity by the finance firm Morgan Stanley found that 44 % of respondents in Cornwall saw themselves as Cornish rather than British or English . A 2008 University of Exeter study conducted in 16 towns across Cornwall found that 59 % felt themselves to be Cornish and 41 % felt " More Cornish than English " , while for over a third of respondents the Cornish identity formed their primary national identity . Genealogy and family history were considered to be the chief criteria for ‘ being ’ Cornish , particularly among those who possessed such ties , while being born in Cornwall was also held to be important . 
 A 2008 study by the University of Edinburgh of 15- and 16 @-@ year @-@ old schoolchildren in Cornwall found that 58 % of respondents felt themselves to be either ‘ Fairly ’ or ‘ Very much ’ Cornish . The other 42 % may be the result of in @-@ migration to the area during the second half of the twentieth century . 
 A 2010 study by the University of Exeter into the meaning of contemporary Cornish identity across Cornwall found that there was a " west @-@ east distance decay in the strength of the Cornish identity . " The study was conducted amongst the farming community as they were deemed to be the socio @-@ professional group most objectively representative of Cornishness . All participants categorised themselves as Cornish and identified Cornish as their primary ethnic group orientation . Those in the west primarily thought of themselves as Cornish and British / Celtic , while those in the east tended to think of themselves as Cornish and English . All participants in West Cornwall who identified as Cornish and not English described people in East Cornwall , without hesitation , as equally Cornish as themselves . Those who identified as Cornish and English stressed the primacy of their Cornishness and a capacity to distance themselves from their Englishness . Ancestry was seen as the most important criterion for being categorised as Cornish , above place of birth or growing up in Cornwall . This study supports a 1988 study by Mary McArthur that had found that the meanings of Cornishness varied substantially , from local to national identity . Both studies also observed that the Cornish were less materialistic than the English . The Cornish generally saw the English , or city people , as being " less friendly and more aggressively self @-@ promoting and insensitive . " The Cornish saw themselves as friendly , welcoming and caring . 
 In November 2010 British prime @-@ minister , David Cameron , said " I think Cornish national identity is very powerful " and that his government would " devolve a lot of power to Cornwall – that will go to the Cornish unitary authority . " 
 = = = 2011 UK Census = = = 
 A campaign for the inclusion of a Cornish tick @-@ box in the nationality section of the 2011 census failed to win the support of parliament in 2009 . As a consequence , posters were created by the census organisation and Cornwall Council which advised residents how they could identify themselves as Cornish by writing it in the national identity and ethnicity sections and record Cornish in the main language section . Additionally , people could record Cornwall as their country of birth . 
 Like other identities , Cornish has an allocated census code , ( 06 ) , the same as for 2001 , which applied and was counted throughout Britain . People were first able to record their ethnicity as Cornish in the 2001 UK Census , and some 37 @,@ 000 people did so by writing it in . 
 A total of 83 @,@ 499 people in England and Wales were described as having a Cornish national identity . 59 @,@ 456 of these were described as Cornish only , 6 @,@ 261 as Cornish and British , and 17 @,@ 782 as Cornish and at least one other identity , with or without British .

 Traditional accounts of Cornish ancestry teach that they are descended from the Celts making them distinct from the English , many ( but not all ) of whom are descended from the Anglo @-@ Saxons who colonised Great Britain from their homelands in northern Europe and drove the Celts to Britain 's western and northern fringes . However , some DNA research investigating the genetic history of the British Isles suggests that three quarters of contemporary Y @-@ chromosomes of British people — including the Cornish — originate from hunter @-@ gatherers who settled in Atlantic Europe during the Paleolithic era , " after the melting of the ice caps but before the land broke away from the mainland and divided into islands " . Archaeological evidence supports pre @-@ historic human habitation in Cornwall , at least as early as the Lower Paleolithic . Although there was a separation of the British Isles from continental Europe as a consequence of the last ice age , genetic evidence indicates that the people of Great Britain broadly share a common ancestry with the Basque people who live in the Basque Country by the Pyrenees . On this basis , geneticist Stephen Oppenheimer suggests that the first settlers of Great Britain were unlikely to have spoken one of the Celtic languages , but rather an ancient tongue related to the Basque language . The next historical immigration to Great Britain occurred during the Neolithic period , interpreted by Bryan Sykes — professor of human genetics at the University of Oxford — as the arrival of the Celts from the Iberian Peninsula , and the origin of Britain 's and Ireland 's Celtic tribes . It is these people who are considered the progenitors of the Cornish . A study by the Wellcome Trust , led by Sir Walter Bodmer and published on Channel 4 's Faces of Britain in April 2007 , showed that the Cornish people have a particular variant of the Melanocortin 1 receptor gene , identifying them as Celts more closely related to the Welsh than to the English . Within the areas of the UK studied , this gene appeared in 26 per cent of the population of Orkney , 23 per cent of Devon , 21 per cent of Wales , 16 per cent of Cornwall , 13 per cent of Kent , and 11 per cent of North East England . According to a DNA survey carried out for the Royal Society and published in 2012 by Peter Donnelly , professor of statistical science at Oxford University and director of the Wellcome Trust genetics centre , Cornish people , along with the Welsh and people of Devon , were found to be among the most genetically distinct groups in Britain . Others in England and Britain were found to have a greater range of genetic ancestries , with people from Cornwall being distinct from those elsewhere in England and the neighbouring population of Devon , though overall still very closely related to the ' English ' possibly due to their stronger genetic links to the tribes that arrived after the last ice age . However , a more recent study by Oxford University geneticist Professor Peter Donnelly suggests that the Cornish have DNA that is more similar to that of other English groups than to the Welsh or the Scots . Both Cornish and <unk> have similar but distinct genetic profiles which show less continental ' German ' influence and more northern ' French ' material than the English and Scots ; all showing a similar portion of " Nordic " material suggesting the idea of a uniform " Celtic " genetic race is false . 
 Throughout classical antiquity the Celts spoke Celtic languages , and formed a series of tribes , cultures and identities , notably the Picts and Gaels in the north and the Britons in the south . The Britons were themselves a divided people ; although they shared the Brythonic languages , they were tribal , and divided into regional societies , and within them sub @-@ groups . Examples of these tribal societies were the Brigantes in the north , and the Ordovices , the Demetae , the Silures and the Deceangli in the west . In the extreme southwest , what was to become Cornwall , were the Dumnonii and Cornovii , who lived in the Kingdom of Dumnonia . The Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century introduced Romans to Britain , who upon their arrival initially recorded the Dumnonii , but later reported on the Cornovii , who were possibly a sub @-@ group of the Dumnonii . Although the Romans colonised much of central and southern Britain , Dumnonia was " virtually unaffected " by the conquest ; Roman rule had little or no impact on the region , meaning it could flourish as a semi- or fully independent kingdom which evidence shows was sometimes under the dominion of the kings of the Britons , and sometimes to have been governed by its own <unk> monarchy , either by the title of duke or king . This petty kingdom shared strong linguistic , political and cultural links with Brittany , a peninsula on continental Europe south of Cornwall inhabited by Britons ; the Cornish and Breton languages were nearly indistinguishable in this period , and both Cornwall and Brittany remain dotted with dedications to the same Celtic saints . 
 The Sack of Rome in the year 410 prompted a complete Roman departure from Britain , and Cornwall then experienced an influx of Celtic Christian missionaries from Ireland who had a profound effect upon the early Cornish people , their culture , faith and architecture . The ensuing decline of the Roman Empire encouraged the Anglo @-@ Saxon invasion of Britain . The Angles , Jutes , Frisii and Saxons , Germanic peoples from northern Europe , established petty kingdoms and settled in different regions of what was to become England , and parts of southern Scotland , progressively defeating the Britons in battle . The Saxons of the Kingdom of Wessex in particular were expanding their territory westwards towards Cornwall . The Cornish were frequently embattled with the West Saxons , who used their Germanic word <unk> ( modern English : Welsh ) meaning " stranger " or " foreigner " , to describe their opponents , later specifying them as the <unk> ( West Welsh ) or <unk> ( the Cornish ) . Conflict continued until King Athelstan of England determined that the River Tamar be the formal boundary between the West Saxons and the Cornish in the year 936 , making Cornwall one of the last retreats of the Britons encouraging the development of a distinct Cornish identity ; Brittonic culture in Britain became confined to Cornwall , parts of Devon , North West England , South West Scotland and Wales . Although a treaty was agreed , Anglo @-@ Saxon political influence stretched westwards until some time in the late 10th century when " Cornwall was definitively incorporated into the Kingdom of England " . 
 = = = Anglicisation and rebellion = = = 
 The Norman conquest of England , which began with an invasion by the troops of William , Duke of Normandy ( later , King William I of England ) in 1066 , resulted in the removal of the Anglo @-@ Saxon derived monarchy , aristocracy , and clerical hierarchy and its replacement by Normans , Scandinavian Vikings from northern France and their Breton allies , who , in many cases , maintained rule in the Brittonic @-@ speaking parts of the conquered lands . The shires of England were progressively divided amongst the companions of William I of England , who served as England 's new nobility . The English would come to absorb the Normans , but the Cornish " vigorously resisted " their influence . At the time of the conquest , Cornwall was under the governance of Cadoc of Cornwall , the last Earl of Cornwall to be directly descended from the ancient monarchy of Cornwall . The Earldom of Cornwall had held devolved semi @-@ sovereignty from England , but in 1067 was granted to Robert , Count of Mortain , King William I 's half @-@ brother , and ruled thereafter by an Anglo @-@ Norman aristocracy ; in the Domesday Book , the record of the great survey of England completed in 1086 , " virtually all " landowners in Cornwall " had English names , making it impossible to be sure who was Cornish and who was English by race " . However , there was a persistent and " continuing differentiation " between the English and Cornish peoples during the Middle Ages , as evidenced by documents such as the 1173 charter of Truro which made explicit mention of both peoples as distinct . 
 The Earldom of Cornwall passed to various English nobles throughout the High Middle Ages , but in 1337 the earldom was given the status of a duchy , and Edward , the Black Prince , the first son and heir of King Edward III of England , became the first Duke of Cornwall as a means for the prince to raise his own capital . Large parts of Cornwall were owned by Edward , 1st Duke of Cornwall , and successive English Dukes of Cornwall became the largest landowners in Cornwall ; The monarchy of England established two special administrative institutions in Cornwall , the first being the Duchy of Cornwall ( one of only two in the Kingdom of England ) and the second being the Cornish Stannary Courts and Parliaments ( which governed Cornwall 's tin industry ) . These two institutions allowed " ordinary Cornish people to believe that they had been granted a unique constitutional status to reflect their unique cultural identity " . However , the Duchy of Cornwall gradually lost its political autonomy from England , a state which became increasingly centralised in London , and by the early @-@ Tudor period the Cornish had begun to see themselves as " a conquered people whose culture , liberties , and prosperity had been downgraded by the English " . This view was exacerbated in the 1490s by heavy taxation imposed by King Henry VII of England upon the impoverished Cornish to raise funds for his military campaigns against King James IV of Scotland and Perkin Warbeck , as well as Henry VII 's suspension of the privileges of the Cornish Stannaries . Having provided " more than their fair share of soldiers and sailors " for the conflict in northern England , and feeling aggrieved at " Cornwall 's status as England 's poorest county " , a popular uprising out of Cornwall ensued — the Cornish Rebellion of 1497 . The rebellion was initially a political march from St <unk> to London led by Thomas <unk> and Michael An Gof , motivated by a " mixture of reasons " ; to raise money for charity ; to celebrate their community ; to present their grievances to the Parliament of England , but gathered pace across the West Country as a revolt against the king . 
 Cornish was the most widely spoken language west of the River Tamar until around the mid @-@ 1300s , when Middle English began to be adopted as a common language of the Cornish people . As late as 1542 Andrew <unk> , an English traveller , physician and writer , wrote that in Cornwall were two languages , " <unk> " and " <unk> " , but that " there may be many men and women " in Cornwall who could not understand English . While the Norman language was in use by much of the English aristocracy , Cornish was used as a lingua franca , particularly in the remote far west of Cornwall . Many Cornish landed gentry chose mottos in the Cornish language for their coat of arms , highlighting its socially high status . However , in 1549 and following the English Reformation , King Edward VI of England commanded that the Book of Common Prayer , an Anglican liturgical text in the English language , should be introduced to all churches in his kingdom , meaning that Latin and Celtic customs and services should be discontinued . The Prayer Book Rebellion was a militant revolt in Cornwall and parts of neighbouring Devon against the Act of Uniformity 1549 , which outlawed all languages from church services apart from English , and is specified as a testament to the affection and loyalty the Cornish people held for the Cornish language . In the rebellion , separate risings occurred simultaneously in Bodmin in <unk> , and Sampford Courtenay in Devon — which would both converge at Exeter , laying siege to the region 's largest Protestant city . However , the rebellion was suppressed thanks largely to the aid of foreign mercenaries in a series of battles in which " hundreds were killed " , effectively ending Cornish as the common language of the Cornish people . The Anglicanism of the Reformation served as a vehicle for Anglicisation in Cornwall ; Protestantism had a lasting cultural effect upon the Cornish by way of linking Cornwall more closely with England , while lessening political and linguistic ties with the Bretons of Brittany . 
 The English Civil War , a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists , polarised the populations of England and Wales . However , Cornwall in the English Civil War was a staunchly Royalist enclave , an " important focus of support for the Royalist cause " . Cornish soldiers were used as scouts and spies during the war , for their language was not understood by English Parliamentarians . The peace that followed the close of the war led to a further shift to the English language by the Cornish people , which encouraged an influx of English people to Cornwall . By the mid @-@ 17th century the use of the Cornish language had retreated far enough west to prompt concern and investigation by antiquarians , such as William Scawen . As the Cornish language diminished the people of Cornwall underwent a process of English <unk> and assimilation , becoming " absorbed into the mainstream of English life " . 
 = = = Industry , revival and the modern period = = = 
 The Industrial Revolution had a major impact upon the Cornish people . Cornwall 's economy was fully integrated into England 's , and mining in Cornwall , always an important source of employment and stability of the Cornish , experienced a process of industrialisation resulting in 30 per cent of Cornwall 's adult population being employed by its mines . During this period , efforts were made by Cornish engineers to design steam engines with which to power water pumps for Cornish mines thus aiding the extraction of mineral ore . Industrial scale tin and copper mining operations in Cornwall melded Cornish identity with engines and heavy industry , and Cornwall 's leading mining engineer , Richard Trevithick , became " as much a part of Cornwall 's heritage as any legendary giant from its Celtic past " . Trevithick 's most significant success was a high @-@ pressure steam engine used to pump water and refuse from mines , but he was also the builder of the first full @-@ scale working railway steam locomotive . On 21 February 1804 , the world 's first locomotive @-@ hauled railway journey took place as Trevithick 's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway of the Penydarren ironworks , near Merthyr Tydfil in Wales . 
 The construction of the Great Western Railway during the Victorian era allowed for an influx of tourists to Cornwall from across Great Britain . Well into the Edwardian era and interwar period , Cornwall was branded as a rural retreat , a " primitive land of magic and romance " , and as an " earlier incarnation of Englishness , a place more English than an England ravaged by modernity " . Cornwall , the United Kingdom 's only region with a subtropical @-@ like climate , became a centre for English tourism , its coastline dominated by resort towns increasingly composed of bungalows and villas . Tourists visiting Cornwall are called <unk> by locals , a Cornish language word for insects , referring to the creatures that the visitors resemble when swarming Cornwall 's resorts . John Nichols Thom , or Mad Tom , ( 1799 – 31 May 1838 ) was a Cornishman self @-@ declared messiah who , in the 19th century led the last battle to be fought on English soil , known as the Battle of <unk> Wood . While not akin to the Cornish rebellions of the past , he did attract some Cornish support as well as mostly Kentish labourers , although his support was primarily of religious followers . 
 In the latter half of the 19th century Cornwall experienced rapid deindustrialisation , with the closure of mines in particular considered by the Cornish to be both an economic and cultural disaster . This , coupled with the rise of Romantic nationalism in Europe inspired and influenced a Celtic Revival in Cornwall , a social , linguistic and artistic movement interested in Cornish medieval ethnology . This Revivalist upsurge investigated Cornwall 's pre @-@ industrial culture , using the Cornish language as the " principal badge of [ Cornish ] nationality and ethnic kinship ” . The first effective revival of Cornish began in 1904 when Henry Jenner , a Celtic language enthusiast , published his book Handbook of the Cornish Language . His orthography , Unified Cornish , was based on Cornish as it was spoken in the 18th century , although his pupil Robert Morton Nance later steered the revival more towards the Middle Cornish that had been used in the 16th century , before the language became influenced by English . 
 The visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 reinvigorated Scottish national identity , melding it with romanticist notions of tartan , kilts and the Scottish Highlands . As Pan @-@ <unk> gathered pace in the early 20th century , Cornishman L. C. R. Duncombe @-@ Jewell and the <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> ( a Cornish language interest group ) asserted the use of Cornish kilts and tartans as a " national dress ... common to all Celtic countries " . In 1924 the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies was formed to facilitate , preserve and maintain <unk> in Cornwall , followed by the similar <unk> Kernow in 1928 , and the formation of the Cornish nationalist political party Mebyon Kernow in 1951 . Increased interest and communication across the Celtic nations in Celtic languages and culture during the 1960s and 1970s spurred on the popularisation of the Cornish self @-@ government movement . Since devolution in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland , enthusiasts for Cornish culture have pressed for the Cornish language to be taught formally in Cornish schools , while Cornish nationalists have demanded greater political autonomy for Cornwall , for example that it be constituted as the United Kingdom 's fifth <unk> country with its own Cornish Assembly . 
 = = Geographic distribution = = 
 The Cornish people are concentrated in Cornwall , but after the Age of Discovery in the early modern period were involved in the British colonisation of the Americas and other transcontinental and transatlantic migrations . Initially , the number of migrants was comparatively small , with those who left Cornwall typically settling in North America or else amongst the ports and plantations of the Caribbean . 
 In the first half of the 19th century , the Cornish people were leaders in tin and copper smelting , while mining in Cornwall was the people 's major occupation . Increased competition from Australia , British Malaya and Bolivia , coupled with the depletion of mineral deposits brought about an economic decline for Cornish mining lasting half a century , and prompting mass human migration from Cornwall . In each decade from 1861 to 1901 , " around 20 % of the Cornish male population migrated abroad " — three times that of the average of England and Wales — and totalling over a quarter of a million people lost to emigration between 1841 and 1901 . There was a displacement of skilled Cornish engineers , farmers , merchants , miners and tradesmen , but their commercial and occupational expertise , particularly in hard rock mining , was highly valued by the communities they met . Within Great Britain , Cornish families were attracted from Cornwall to North East England — particularly on Teesside — to partake in coal mining as a means to earn wealth by using their mining skill . This has resulted in a concentration of Cornish names on and around Teesside that persists into the 21st century . 
 Large numbers of the 19th century Cornish emigrants eventually returned to Cornwall , whilst the rate of emigration from Cornwall declined after World War I. However , the global connections of the remaining Cornish diaspora , which is concentrated in English @-@ speaking countries such as Australia , Canada , South Africa and the United States , are " very strong " . Their outreach has contributed to the international spread of Methodism , a movement within Protestant Christianity that was popular with the Cornish people at the time of their mass migration . " Cousin Jacks " is a nickname for the overseas Cornish , thought to derive from the practice of Cornishmen asking if job vacancies could be filled by their cousin named Jack in Cornwall . 
 = = = Australia = = = 
 From the beginning of Australia 's colonial period until after the Second World War , people from the United Kingdom made up a large majority of people coming to Australia , meaning that many Australian @-@ born people can trace their origins to Britain . The Cornish people in particular were actively encouraged to emigrate to Australia following the demise of Cornish mining in the 19th century . A " vigorous recruiting campaign " was launched to encourage the Cornish to aid with mining in Australia because of their experience and expertise . Free passage to South Australia in particular was granted to hundreds of Cornish miners and their families , so much so , that a large Cornish community gathered in Australia 's Copper Coast , and South Australia 's Yorke Peninsula became known as " Little Cornwall ” . It has been estimated between 1837 and 1840 , 15 per cent of all assisted migrants to South Australia were Cornish . 
 Cornish settlement impacted upon social , cultural and religious life throughout the history of South Australia . Cornish identity was embraced strongly in the Yorke Peninsula , but also in the more outlying mining towns of Kapunda and Burra , where Cornish miners constituted a sizeable community . Methodism , was the main form of religious practice for the Cornish . Methodist sensibilities were held with strong conviction by the migrant Cornish in a direct rivalry with Catholic Irish people in Australia . The <unk> <unk> is the largest Cornish festival in the world , held in the Kadina , Moonta and Wallaroo towns on the Yorke Peninsula , which attracts tens of thousands of visitors bi @-@ annually . 
 = = = Canada = = = 
 European fishing ventures in and around Newfoundland during the 16th century were the earliest Cornish activity in what was to become Canada . However , permanent settlement by the Cornish across the Atlantic Ocean was rare until at least the 19th century . The British colonisation of the Americas encouraged additional migration of the Cornish to the Canadas , particularly by those who served in Great Britain 's Royal Navy . The creation of the colony of British North America spurred more people from Cornwall to settle in North America ; they were registered as English migrants . Many Cornish ( and other West Country ) immigrants who had been agricultural labourers settled in an area of what is now South Central Ontario in what were the counties of Northumberland , Durham and Ontario , ranging from the towns of Port Hope and Cobourg in the east , to Whitby in the west and to the north ends of those counties .

 In 1825 a band of 60 Cornishmen left Falmouth for Mineral del Monte in central Mexico with 1 @,@ 500 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 500 long tons ; 1 @,@ 700 short tons ) of mining machinery with which to apply their mining skill and technologies to resuscitate Mexico 's ailing silver mining industry after the neglect caused by the Mexican War of Independence . Following their sea voyage they attempted to dock at Veracruz but were forced away by the Spanish to a beach at Mocambo from where they hauled their machinery through jungle and swamp to Santa Fe . During this haul through the jungle , the Cornishmen and their Mexican helpers fell victim to yellow fever , resulting in 30 Cornish and 100 Mexican fatalities . The fever forced the survivors to abandon their equipment and head inland up into the mountains to Xalapa to try and escape the mosquitos for three months , until the end of the rainy season . Once the rainy season closed the Cornish and Mexican miners continued their 250 @-@ mile ( 402 km ) " Great Trek " to Mineral del Monte , transporting their machinery to an altitude of 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 048 m ) above sea level and arriving at their destination on 1 May 1826 . Following their arrival , the Cornish community flourished and stayed in central Mexico until the Mexican Revolution in 1910 . Although the Cornish community in Mexico broadly returned to Cornwall , they left a cultural legacy ; Cornish pasties , Cornish mining museums and a Cornish Mexican Cultural Society are all part of the local heritage and tradition in and around Mineral del Monte . 
 = = = South Africa = = = 
 The Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1886 encouraged large numbers of Cornish miners to migrate to the South African Republic . Although an international gold rush , the Cornish overwhelmingly formed the skilled labour force in the Witwatersrand , until the outbreak of the Second Boer War prompted a retreat . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 The discovery of lead ore and copper in North America prompted an influx of Cornish miners to the continent , particularly around the Upper Mississippi River . By the early 19th century Cornish people were present in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan — particularly the mining town of Ishpeming . Additional waves of Cornish migrants followed the California Gold Rush of the mid @-@ 19th century ; in the 1890s it was estimated that in California 's Grass Valley , over 60 per cent of the population was Cornish . It has a tradition of carols stemming from the Cornish who settled the area as gold miners in the 19th century . The carols have become " the identity of the town " , some of the members of the Grass Valley Cornish Carol Choir are descendents of the original Cornish settlers . 
 Most migratory Cornish to the United States were classified as English or British , meaning that the precise number of Cornish Americans is difficult to estimate . The aggregate number of immigrants from Cornwall to the United States before World War I is suggested to be around 100 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Culture = = 
 The survival of a distinct Cornish culture has been attributed to Cornwall 's geographic isolation . Contemporaneously , the underlying notion of Cornish culture is that it is distinct from the culture of England , despite its anglicisation , and that it is instead part of a Celtic tradition . According to American academic Paul Robert <unk> , modern @-@ day Cornish activists have claimed several Victorian era inventions including the Cornish engine , Christmas carols , rugby football and brass bands as part of this Cornish tradition . Cornish cultural tradition is most strongly associated with the people 's most historical occupation , mining , an aspect of Cornish history and culture that has influenced its cuisine , symbols and identity . 
 Cornwall has its own tradition of Christian saints , derived from Celtic extraction , that have given rise to localised dedications . Saint Piran is the 5th century Christian abbot , supposedly of Irish origin , who is patron saint of both tin miners and Cornwall . According to popular mythology , Piran , an Irish scholar who studied Christianity in Ancient Rome was to be drowned in the Irish Sea by the High Kings of Ireland , but instead floated across to Perranporth in Cornwall by the will of God to preach the ministry of Jesus . Saint Piran 's Flag , a centred white cross on a black field , was described as the " Standard of Cornwall " in 1838 and was re @-@ introduced by Celtic <unk> thereafter as a county flag of Cornwall . It has been seized upon by the Cornish people as a symbol of their identity , displayed on cars and flying from buildings including those of Cornwall Council . St Piran 's Day is an annual patronal fete , and the pre @-@ eminent Cornish festival celebrating Cornish culture and history on 5 March . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 The Cornish language is derived from the Brythonic branch of the Insular Celtic languages . It is closely related to the Breton language , and to a lesser extent shares commonalities with the Welsh language , although they are not mutually intelligible . The language functioned as a community language in Cornwall until a language shift to the English language was completed during the late 18th century . The demise of the Cornish language is attributed to English cultural influence , particularly the political and religious dominance of the English Reformation and the Act of Uniformity 1549 which outlawed all church services within the Kingdom of England that were not in English . The exact date of the death of Cornish is unclear and disputed , but popularly it is claimed that the last monolingual Cornish speaker was Dolly <unk> , a Mousehole resident who died in 1777 . 
 The revival of Cornish began in 1904 when Henry Jenner , a Celtic language enthusiast , published his book Handbook of the Cornish Language . He based his work on Cornish as it was spoken in the 18th century , although his pupil Robert Morton Nance , with his orthography , Unified Cornish , later steered the revival more towards the Middle Cornish that had been used in the 16th century , before the language became more heavily influenced by English . This set the tone for the next few decades ; as the revival gained pace , learners of the language disagreed on which style of Cornish to use , and a number of competing orthographies — Unified Cornish , Unified Cornish Revised , Modern Cornish , <unk> <unk> — were in use by the end of the 20th century . A standard written form was agreed in 2008 . 
 Cornish is a restored and living modern language , but most of its speakers are enthusiasts , persons who have learned the language through private study . Cornish speakers are geographically dispersed , meaning there is no part of Cornwall where it is spoken as a community language . As of 2009 , it is taught in fifty primary schools , although regular broadcast in Cornish is limited to a weekly bilingual programme on BBC Radio Cornwall . Daily life in Cornwall therefore is conducted in the English language , albeit with some regional peculiarities . 
 Legends of the Fall , a novella by American author Jim Harrison , detailing the lives of a Cornish American family in the early 20th century , contains several Cornish language terms . These were also included in the Academy Award winning film of the same name starring Anthony Hopkins as Col. William Ludlow and Brad Pitt as Tristan Ludlow . 
 = = = Literature and folklore = = = 
 Early medieval Cornwall was associated with the Matter of Britain , a national myth recounting a legendary Celtic history of Brittonic warriors , including King Arthur . The Matter of Britain was supported by texts such as the Historia Regum Britanniae , a pseudohistorical account of the history of the ancient Britons , written in the mid @-@ 12th century by Geoffrey of Monmouth . The Historia Regum Britanniae chronicled the lives of legendary kings of the Britons in a narrative spanning a time of two thousand years , beginning with the Trojans founding the ancient British nation and continuing until the Anglo @-@ Saxon invasion of Britain in the 7th century forced the Celtic Britons to the west coast , namely Wales and Cornwall . Although broadly thought of as a work of fiction , Geoffrey of Monmouth 's work had a lasting effect upon the identity of the Cornish . His " historical construct " characterised the ancient Britons as heroes , which later helped Celtic revivalists to redefine Cornishness as an identity closely related to ancient heroic Celtic folklore . 
 Another strand of Cornish folklore is derived from tales of seafaring pirates and smugglers who thrived in and around Cornwall from the early modern period through to the 19th century . Cornish pirates exploited both their knowledge of the Cornish coastline as well as its sheltered creeks and hidden anchorages . For many fishing villages , loot and contraband provided by pirates supported a strong and secretive underground economy in Cornwall . 
 Legendary creatures that appear in Cornish folklore include <unk> , knockers and <unk> . Tales of these creatures are thought to have developed as supernatural explanations for the frequent and deadly cave @-@ ins that occurred during 18th @-@ century Cornish tin mining , or else a creation of the oxygen @-@ starved minds of exhausted miners who returned from the underground . 
 = = = Performing and visual arts = = = 
 Celtic crosses , many dating from between the 7th and 15th centuries , are found in Cornwall and have been used as inspiration in modern and contemporary Cornish visual arts . In the 1780s , John Opie was the first Cornish @-@ born painter to gain widespread attention ; his work was exhibited at the Royal Academy and he was described by Joshua Reynolds as " like Caravaggio and Velázquez in one " . Artists who appreciated the quality of Cornwall 's natural light , such as J. M. W. Turner , began to visit , with more following after the opening of the Great Western Railway , including Whistler and Sickert . Stanhope Forbes and Frank Bramley settled in Cornwall in the 1880s , establishing the Newlyn School of painting en plein air . By the 1920s , the <unk> Bernard Leach was established at St Ives , and the St Ives School for abstract artists formed there , influenced by naive painters such as Alfred Wallis , and involving the work of Ben Nicholson , his wife Barbara Hepworth , Naum Gabo and Patrick Heron . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 <unk> , the religion of the Cornish Britons was Celtic polytheism , a pagan , animistic faith , assumed to be led by Druids in full or in part . Early Christianity is thought to have existed in Cornwall during the 1st century , but limited to individual travellers and visitors , possibly including Priscillian , a Galician theologian who may have been exiled to the Isles of Scilly . Celtic Christianity was introduced to Cornwall in the year 520 by Saint Petroc , a <unk> from the kingdom of Glywysing , and other missionaries from Wales , as well as by Gaelic monks and holy women from Ireland ; this " formative period " has left a legacy of granite high cross monuments throughout Cornwall . Dedications to many different Cornish saints can also be traced to this period . In the Middle Ages , Roman Catholicism was dominant in Cornwall , and even in the 17th century the Cornish were " fervently Roman Catholic " , slow to accept the Protestant Reformation , according to some scholars . The adoption of Anglicanism was , eventually , near @-@ universal in Cornwall and facilitated the anglicisation of the Cornish people . A variety of dissenting congregations such as the Quakers and Baptists were to be found in certain districts . Through a combination of tours of Cornwall by John Wesley , rural isolation and compatibility with Cornish tastes and sensibilities , Methodism , an evangelical revival movement within the Church of England , became the form of Christianity practised by the majority of the population all over Cornwall during the 19th century . During this time other kinds of Methodist churches appeared such as the Bible Christians and there were also Evangelical and Anglo @-@ Catholic revivals within the Church of England . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 Cornish cuisine is a regional variety of British cuisine , strongly rooted in a tradition of using local produce , which is used to create relatively simple dishes . Most prominent in Cornish cuisine is the pasty ( sometimes known as the Cornish pasty ) made from diced beef , potato , onion and swede ( commonly called ' turnip ' by the Cornish ) , enclosed within a pastry crust and then baked . One idea of its origins suggests that it evolved as a portable lunch for Cornish miners , the crust serving as a disposable handle that could be held by a miner 's hand without soiling the filling . Fish was an important element of the Cornish diet , but international commercial fishing was also well established by the 16th century , and tons of pilchards were exported from Cornwall to France , Italy and Spain every year . Stargazy pie is an occasional festive Cornish dish with the heads of fish standing on their tails , originally pilchards , piercing a pastry crust . The saffron bun , also known as the tea treat bun , is a sweet bread with its origins in Cornwall . 
 = = = Sport = = = 
 With its comparatively small , rural population , major contribution by the Cornish to national sport in the United Kingdom has been limited . There are no teams affiliated to the Cornwall County Football Association that play in the Football League of England and Wales , and the Cornwall County Cricket Club plays as one of the minor counties of English cricket . Viewed as an " important identifier of ethnic affiliation " , rugby union has become a sport strongly tied with notions of Cornishness , and since the 20th century , rugby union in Cornwall has emerged as one of the most popular spectator and team sports in Cornwall , with professional Cornish rugby footballers being described as a " formidable force " , " naturally independent , both in thought and deed , yet paradoxically staunch English patriots whose top players have represented England with pride and passion " . In 1985 , sports journalist Alan Gibson made a direct connection between love of rugby in Cornwall and the ancient parish games of hurling and wrestling that existed for centuries before rugby officially began . 
 Cornish wrestling ( also known as <unk> ' ) is a regional , folk style of grappling or martial arts . The Cornish Wrestling Association was formed in 1923 , to standardise the rules of the sport and to promote Cornish wrestling throughout Cornwall and the world . Together with Cornish hurling ( a localised form of medieval football ) , <unk> ' has been promoted as a distinctly Celtic game , tied closely with Cornish identity . 
 Surfing was popularised in Cornwall during the late 20th century , and has since become readily associated with Cornishness . The waves around the Cornish coastline are created by low pressure systems from the Atlantic Ocean which unleash powerful swells eastwards creating multiple , excellent surfing conditions in some parts of the coast of Cornwall . Newquay , one of Britain 's " premier surfing towns " , regularly hosts world championship surfing events . 
 = = Institutions and politics = = 
 The politics of Cornwall take place within a wider national political framework of a constitutional monarchy , in which the United Kingdom 's monarch is head of state and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of government , and the supranational framework of the European Union . Cornish politics are marked by a long tradition of Liberalism . 
 Important historical institutions were the Duchy of Cornwall and the Cornish Stannary Courts and Parliaments . The Stannary court administered equity , through special laws and legal exemptions , for all matters relating to the tin mines and tin trade in Cornwall . Cornish miners were effectively exempt from the jurisdiction of the law courts at Westminster , except " in such cases as should affect land , life or limb " . The ancient privileges of the Stannary Courts and Parliaments were confirmed by successive Royal Charters in the Middle Ages , including those administered by Kings John , Edward I and Edward III of England . As the tin mines of Cornwall lost their economic importance during the 18th and 19th centuries , so the Stannary institutions lost political power . The last Stannary parliament was held at Truro in 1752 , and continued , by adjournments , until 11 September 1753 . 
 As in the rest of Great Britain , the Liberal Party dominated Cornish politics during the 19th century , although Socialism gained limited support in western Cornwall , and the Labour Party won preference after World War I. Nationalism ( or regionalism ) in Cornwall traces its roots to the Irish Home Rule bills of the late 19th century , and is represented by the Cornish self @-@ government movement , a political action group that is predominantly organised to promote Cornwall as the national homeland of the Cornish , campaign for devolution , and win it the status as a fifth country within the UK rather than outright separatism . More " militant " variants of Cornish nationalism however claim that because of historical constitutional peculiarities regarding the status of Cornwall , the law of the European Union does or should not have jurisdiction over Cornwall until Cornish sovereignty is recognised . Popularisation of Cornish nationalism is attributed to a Celtic cultural revival in Cornwall which itself began with a <unk> interested in the Cornish language in the 1920s . The revival of the Cornish language encouraged a parallel revival of Celtic traditions , which by the 1970s had spurred on Cornish nationalism . The United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community in 1973 prompted claims that the Cornish should be granted their own devolved national assembly — the Cornish Assembly — comparable to that of the National Assembly for Wales . Mebyon Kernow is a left @-@ wing political party based in Cornwall , founded in 1951 . Its main objective is attaining greater autonomy for Cornwall through the establishment of a legislative Cornish Assembly . As at 2009 Mebyon Kernow has no Members of Parliament elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom , and in the United Kingdom local elections , 2009 received 4 per cent of votes to elect councillors to Cornwall Council , behind the Conservative Party ( 34 per cent ) , Liberal Democrats ( 28 per cent ) , and Independents ( 23 per cent ) Since the 2009 structural changes to local government in England , Cornwall Council has been a unitary authority , serving as the sole executive , deliberative , and legislative body responsible for local policy , setting council tax , and allocating budgets . 
 Following the Cornwall Council election in May 2013 , the council remained as " no overall control " , with the Independent politicians becoming the largest grouping on the council through a modest gain of councillors from the previous election . The Liberal Democrats remained the second largest party after losing 2 councillors and the Conservatives slipped to third after losing over a third of their councillors . The Labour Party ( + 8 ) , UKIP ( + 6 ) , and the Green Party ( + 1 ) all gained seats , with UKIP and the Greens entering Cornwall Council for the first time . Mebyon Kernow had 6 councilors prior to the election , having added 2 since the 2009 election , their total following the election was reduced to 4 . 
 In the 2015 general election all Cornish seats were won by the Conservatives . 
 = Ricketts Glen State Park = 
 Ricketts Glen State Park is a Pennsylvania state park on 13 @,@ 050 acres ( 5 @,@ 280 ha ) in Columbia , Luzerne , and Sullivan counties in Pennsylvania in the United States . Ricketts Glen is a National Natural Landmark known for its old @-@ growth forest and 24 named waterfalls along Kitchen Creek , which flows down the Allegheny Front escarpment from the Allegheny Plateau to the Ridge @-@ and @-@ Valley Appalachians . The park is near the borough of Benton on Pennsylvania Route 118 and Pennsylvania Route 487 , and is in five townships : Sugarloaf in Columbia County , Fairmount and Ross in Luzerne County , and Colley and Davidson in Sullivan County . 
 Ricketts Glen 's land was once home to Native Americans . From 1822 to 1827 , a turnpike was built along the course of PA 487 in what is now the park , where two squatters harvested cherry trees to make bed frames from about 1830 to 1860 . The park 's waterfalls were one of the main attractions for a hotel from 1873 to 1903 ; the park is named for the hotel 's proprietor , R. Bruce Ricketts , who built the trail along the waterfalls . By the 1890s Ricketts owned or controlled over 80 @,@ 000 acres ( 320 km2 ; 120 sq mi ) and made his fortune clearcutting almost all of that land , including much of what is now the park ; however he preserved about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) of virgin forest in the creek 's three glens . The sawmill was at the village of Ricketts , which was mostly north of the park . After his death in 1918 , Ricketts ' heirs began selling land to the state for Pennsylvania State Game Lands . 
 Plans to make Ricketts Glen a national park in the 1930s were ended by budget issues and the Second World War ; Pennsylvania began purchasing the land in 1942 and fully opened Ricketts Glen State Park in 1944 . The Benton Air Force Station , a Cold War radar installation in the park , operated from 1951 to 1975 and still serves as airport radar for nearby Wilkes @-@ Barre and as the Red Rock Job Corps Center . Improvements since the creation of the state park include a new dam for the 245 @-@ acre ( 99 ha ) Lake Jean , the breaching of two other dams Ricketts built , trail modifications , and a fire tower . In 1999 Hurricane Floyd briefly closed the park and downed thousands of trees ; helicopter logging protected the ecosystem while harvesting lumber worth nearly $ 7 million , some of which paid for a new park office in 2001 . 
 The park offers hiking , ten cabins , camping ( one of the two camping areas is on a peninsula in the lake ) , horseback riding , and hunting . Lake Jean is used for swimming , fishing , canoeing and kayaking . In winter there is cross @-@ country skiing , ice fishing on the lake , and ice climbing on the frozen falls . The Glens Natural Area has eight named waterfalls in Glen Leigh and ten in Ganoga Glen , these come together at Waters Meet ; downstream in Ricketts Glen there are four to six named waterfalls . The park has four rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods , and is home to a wide variety of plants and animals . It was named an Important Bird Area by the Pennsylvania Audubon Society and is an Important Mammal Area too . Ricketts Glen State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources ( DCNR ) and its Bureau of State Parks as one of " 25 Must @-@ See Pennsylvania State Parks " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Native Americans = = = 
 Ricketts Glen State Park is in Pennsylvania , where humans have lived since at least 10000 BC . The first settlers in the state were Paleo @-@ Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools . The hunter @-@ gatherers of the Archaic period , which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000 BC , used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts . The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi @-@ permanent villages and horticulture , between 1000 BC and 1500 AD . Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles , burial mounds , pipes , bows and arrows , and ornaments . 
 The park is in the Susquehanna River drainage basin , the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian @-@ speaking Susquehannocks . They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large longhouses , but their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois , and by 1675 they had died out , moved away , or been assimilated into other tribes . 
 After the demise of the Susquehannocks , the lands of the Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois , who also lived in longhouses , primarily in what is now the state of New York . The Iroquois had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers . To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks , the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the Susquehanna watershed , including the Shawnee and Lenape ( or Delaware ) . 
 The French and Indian War ( 1754 – 1763 ) and subsequent colonial expansion encouraged the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin . On November 5 , 1768 , the British acquired land , known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase , from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix ; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park . After the American Revolutionary War , Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania . About 1890 a Native American pot , decorated in the style of " the peoples of the Susquehanna region " , was found under a rock ledge on Kitchen Creek by Murray Reynolds , for whom a waterfall is named . 
 = = = Early inhabitants = = = 
 Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties . After the 1768 purchase , the land became part of Northumberland County , but was soon divided among other counties . Most of the park is in Luzerne County , which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County . Within Luzerne County , the majority of the park , including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean , is in Fairmount Township , which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834 ; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township , which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842 . The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County , which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County ; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833 , while Colley Township , which has the park office and part of Lake Jean , was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849 . A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County ; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812 , the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County . 
 A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known ; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond ( now called Lake Ganoga ) , which is less than 0 @.@ 4 miles ( 0 @.@ 6 km ) northwest of the park . The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike , which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north . The turnpike , which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park , had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851 ; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon . 
 The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber . One squatter , Jesse Dodson , cut trees from around 1830 to 1860 and built a mill and the dam for what became Lake Rose in 1842 . Dodson also built a dam south of Mud Pond , near what became Lake Jean ; both dams were on the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek , and each was used to make a " log splash pond " . The other squatter , named Sickler , also built a mill and log dam , at what became Lake Leigh on the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek . Sickler was active from 1838 to about 1860 . 
 In 1865 , a well was drilled at the Dodson mill site , after a Mr. Hadley fraudulently added oil to springs in what became the park . Hadley , who had hoped that investors would think petroleum was present , got the Wheeler & Wilson sewing machine company to invest $ 40 @,@ 000 ( $ 620 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) in his scheme . In the next two years they drilled two wells , one 2 @,@ 100 feet ( 640 m ) deep at the former Dodson sawmill at Lake Rose and the other 1 @,@ 900 feet ( 580 m ) deep near the Ricketts mansion . No oil was ever found , and Hadley eventually fled to Canada .
