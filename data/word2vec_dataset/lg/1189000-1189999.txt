 Foyt was born in Louisville , Kentucky , but lists his hometown as Hockley , Texas , the long @-@ time residence of his grandfather , racing legend A. J. Foyt , who guided him through much of his career . 
 Foyt appeared in the 2005 film , The Dukes of Hazzard and is an avid Texas Longhorns fan . In March 2007 , he was charged with DUI stemming from an incident in December of the previous year . 
 He is married to Indianapolis Colts vice @-@ president Casey Irsay , daughter of team owner Jim Irsay , in July 2009 . On September 19 , 2010 , it was announced by commentators during the Indy Japan 300 that Casey Foyt had given birth to a son , A. J. Foyt V. Foyt is sometimes referred to by the nickname " Quattro " or the stylized " <unk> " or " <unk> " .

 Foyt began racing Junior <unk> as a nine @-@ year @-@ old and won two titles . He then moved to karts for many years before moving to formula race cars in 2001 . In 2001 , he won six of nine SCCA events to claim the Southwest Regional championship . He finished third in SCCA 's national point championships and was the series ' Rookie of the Year . That same year , he competed at the World Karting Association 's Dirt World Championships at Daytona Beach , Florida and finished second in the Briggs Heavy feature event . Foyt competed in his first USAC Silver Crown event that August . In 2002 , A.J. moved to his grandfather 's team , A.J. Foyt Enterprises , in the newly formed Infiniti Pro Series and won the championship with four wins in seven events . In 2003 , he moved up to Foyt Enterprises ' IRL IndyCar Series team , finishing 21st in the final standings . 
 Foyt currently holds the record for the youngest driver to race in the Indy 500 . His rookie race in 2003 occurred on his 19th birthday . He took the record from <unk> Garza who was slightly over 2 months older for his first start in 1981 . 
 He continued to struggle in IndyCars , finishing 18th in the 2004 points and 20th in 2005 . In the 2005 Indianapolis 500 Foyt was involved in an accident with a top Champ Car driver , Bruno Junqueira , who suffered a broken back . The season did not improve as the team switched from Toyota to Chevrolet power mid @-@ season and Foyt was replaced for the late @-@ season road course events by Jeff <unk> . 
 = = NASCAR = = 
 In October 2005 , Foyt announced that at the end of the 2005 season , he would leave Foyt Enterprises and drive in the NASCAR Busch Series for the # 38 Akins Motorsports team and was signed as a developmental driver for Evernham Motorsports . He ran several events in the # 38 late in 2005 , but failed to produce results . In 2006 , he was scheduled to run the entire Busch Series schedule in the # 38 and be a competitor for the Rookie of the Year award . However , early in the 2006 season , Akins was purchased by Braun Racing , which switched the # 38 from Dodge to Chevrolet bodies . Foyt had an exclusive contract with Dodge that prevented him from continuing with the team . After a week off , Ray Evernham found him a ride with <unk> Racing , but he failed to qualify for his first race with the team and has not attempted a NASCAR race since .

 On September 5 , 2006 , Foyt was tabbed by the 2005 IndyCar Championship team , Andretti Green Racing , to replace injured regular AGR driver Dario Franchitti .

 In January 2007 , Foyt signed with Vision Racing to return to the IRL for the 2007 season as well as drive with the team in the 2007 24 Hours of Daytona . 
 On August 5 , 2007 , during the Firestone Indy 400 , Foyt was involved in a spectacular seven @-@ car crash in which Dario Franchitti 's car was sent airborne and then came down on Foyt 's car . While Foyt was uninjured , Franchitti 's car left visible tire marks on Foyt 's helmet . Foyt 's crew was able to repair the car and get him back on the track where he completed enough laps to secure an 8th @-@ place finish . The following week at the Meijer Indy 300 , Foyt 's crew gave him great pit stops which allowed him to take to lead with 10 laps remaining . Even though Foyt was passed a few laps later by Tony Kanaan and Scott Dixon , he managed to hold on the rest of the way and drive to a career @-@ best 3rd @-@ place finish , the first Top @-@ 5 finish of his career . It was also the best finish in Vision Racing 's team history , tying Tomas Scheckter 's 3rd @-@ place finish at the Milwaukee Mile in 2006 .

 Foyt returned to be one of Vision Racing 's drivers in the 2008 24 Hours of Daytona . He returned to the Vision team for the 2008 IndyCar Series season driving the # 2 car that was formerly driven by Tomas Scheckter . 
 On March 28 , Foyt seemed to have earned a career best start for an IndyCar Series race at Homestead @-@ Miami Speedway for the 2008 <unk> Auto Insurance Indy 300 with the third best qualifying time . His Vision Racing teammate , Ed Carpenter also earned a career best start with the 2nd best qualifying time . However , both cars failed technical inspection , meaning they had to start at the rear of the field . Foyt drove his No. 2 entry from the last position ( 25th ) to a ninth @-@ place finish in the race . 
 Two races later at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan , Foyt had his first top @-@ 10 start of the season for the Indy Japan 300 when qualifying was rained out . The starting grid was based on driver points standings . Of the drivers there , Foyt was eighth in the championship points standings . He was helped with some drivers ahead of him racing in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach . Foyt had contact with the wall , forcing him to retire from the race early , with a 15th @-@ place finish . 
 The following week at Kansas Speedway , Foyt and his teammate Ed Carpenter shared the third row , with Foyt qualifying 5th . It was his best career start and second top @-@ 10 start in a row . In the <unk> Turbo Indy 300 , Foyt had his chances of a high finish end as his car was caught in the pits when an accident involving Buddy Rice occurred . Foyt would drive to an eighth @-@ place finish . Foyt 's best finish of the season came in the Iowa Corn Indy 250 in June at the Iowa Speedway where he finished fifth . Foyt finished 19th in points .

 Vision Racing was unable to secure sponsorship to run a second car in 2009 , leaving Foyt out of a ride . He returned to A. J. Foyt Enterprises for the 93rd Indianapolis 500 , driving the # 41 ABC Supply entry for his grandfather , A. J. Foyt . Foyt finished 16th on the lead lap as his teammate Vitor Meira was injured in a late @-@ race crash . Paul Tracy was drafted as the substitute driver for Meira at the next race , but Foyt stepped into the car for his home race at Texas Motor Speedway . Ryan Hunter @-@ Reay drove the car for the rest of the season and Texas would be Foyt 's last race of 2009 . 
 In 2010 he was again entered in a second Foyt Enterprises car for the Indy 500 . After the morning practice session on the final day of qualifying A. J. Foyt IV and his grandfather got in an argument regarding the car 's setup resulting in the younger A. J. quitting the team . Jaques <unk> was drafted in on short notice to qualify the car but failed to find enough speed to make the field .

 = Astrid Peth = 
 Astrid Peth is a fictional character played by Kylie Minogue in the long @-@ running British science fiction television series Doctor Who . She is a one @-@ off companion of the Tenth Doctor who appears in the episode " Voyage of the Damned " , which was first broadcast in the UK on 25 December 2007 . Minogue 's casting in the role was a major coup for Doctor Who , her fame attracting much publicity for " Voyage of the Damned " . Subsequently , much of the episode 's success in terms of viewing figures was attributed to Minogue 's appearance in the role . 
 = = Conception = = 
 Russell T Davies announced that Astrid Peth would be the next companion after Martha Jones ( played by Freema Agyeman ) on 14 August 2007 . Astrid 's surname , Peth , was confirmed in the Christmas edition of Radio Times . Davies has stated that the character was always going to be a " one @-@ off " even before Minogue was cast and that Astrid would demonstrate " a whole new take – again – on what a companion can be " . The name Astrid Peth generated some speculation before the episode 's broadcast over the findings that Astrid is an anagram of TARDIS , and that Peth means thing in Welsh . However , the episode established no such connection . On Doctor Who Confidential , Minogue describes Astrid as a " dreamer " and that meeting with the Doctor rekindles Astrid 's desire to explore . Later in his book A Writer 's Tale Davies discussed with co @-@ author Benjamin Cook how he had originally named the character " Peth " in a treatment but it bugged him , he later renamed her to " Astrid " giving the reason that it " ... sounds more spacey , more like a <unk> [ sic ] Doctor 's companion " . 
 = = Character history = = 
 Astrid appears in the episode " Voyage of the Damned " . She is introduced aboard the starship Titanic as a waitress from the planet Sto with a dream of seeing the stars . Meeting the Tenth Doctor aboard Titanic , she quickly befriends him . She accompanies the Doctor ( David Tennant ) on a trip organised by Titanic 's resident historian , Mr Copper ( Clive Swift ) , teleporting with some Titanic passengers down to Earth where she and the Doctor meet Wilfred Mott ( Bernard Cribbins ) . Upon their return to the ship , she and the Doctor discover the plan of Max Capricorn ( George Costigan ) to destroy the Titanic , its passengers and the nearby people of Earth with his villainous angelic robots , the Host . As they attempt to save the ship , Astrid grows increasingly fond of the Doctor , kissing him as part of what she assures is an " old tradition " on Sto . In the episode 's climax , Astrid sacrifices herself to save the Doctor from Capricorn by driving Capricorn off a platform with a forklift truck and both appear to fall to their deaths . Later , realising Astrid was still wearing a teleporter bracelet , the Doctor attempts to recall her atoms in an attempt to resurrect her , but there is insufficient power aboard the damaged Titanic to do so . Astrid reappears spectral and bewildered , as the Doctor gives her a goodbye kiss before freeing her sentient atoms ( described as " stardust " ) to roam space as energy . 
 In " Journey 's End " , Davros taunts the Doctor about the countless people who have died for him . A clip from " Voyage of the Damned " featuring Astrid is shown as part of a montage . 
 = = Casting = = 
 The BBC officially announced that Minogue was to feature as Astrid in the episode " Voyage of the Damned " on 3 July 2007 . The official announcement followed rumours regarding Minogue 's casting having already circulated in the press , although the episode 's writer Russell T Davies had denied these rumours in in @-@ house BBC publication Ariel in an attempt to keep the news secret for longer . Furthermore , Minogue herself had confirmed that she would be appearing in the episode in InStyle magazine , whilst the London paper Standard Lite published a photograph of Minogue 's creative director Will Baker carrying a ' to do list ' with a note about a Doctor Who script on it , thus indicating that Minogue would be in the episode . Minogue had also been sighted filming for Doctor Who by members of the public before the official announcement of her casting . Baker , a long @-@ term Doctor Who fan , was largely responsible for Minogue 's casting by setting up a meeting between her , Davies and Julie Gardner . Davies has claimed that Minogue was keen to appear on Doctor Who to relaunch her acting career . 
 = = Publicity and promotion = = 
 Minogue posed with a Dalek in an exclusive photo shoot for Doctor Who Magazine promoting " Voyage of the Damned " .

Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant interviewed Minogue about her role as Astrid Peth on BBC Radio 2 in X @-@ Amining Kylie first broadcast on 27 November 2007 . <unk> discussion about her involvement in " Voyage of the Damned " was included in the extended repeat of X @-@ Amining Kylie , entitled Re @-@ X @-@ Amining Kylie , broadcast on Boxing Day 2007 . It was leaked to The Sun and other media outlets that Astrid would kiss the Doctor . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The episode was seen by 13 @.@ 8 million watching at its peak , according to consolidated ratings , when it was first broadcast on Christmas Day on BBC One . The ratings success of " Voyage of the Damned " has been partially and fully attributed to Minogue 's casting in the role of Astrid . Younger viewers who were fans of pop star Kylie were left distraught by Astrid 's death and had to be convinced that Kylie was not dead in real life . 
 Although reviewer Jane Simon would have liked to have seen more of the character and it has been asserted that her appearance in the episode has helped her make " a full return to the limelight " , Minogue 's appearance was not universally praised . Gareth McLean , a TV writer for The Guardian , described Minogue as " not that good ... she 's blank and insipid " . McLean wrote : 
 There 's no chemistry between Astrid and the Doctor , she delivers her lines with a real lack of conviction and thus we never really believe in Astrid as a character . Where Catherine Tate 's Donna in last year 's special was overbearing , Kylie Minogue 's Astrid is hardly there at all . It does make you wonder why casting Kylie was regarded as a coup . She 's a pop star – of course she 's going to say yes to being beamed into millions of homes in the run @-@ up to Christmas . She 's got a duff album to sell . In truth , Kylie should be grateful to [ Doctor Who ] . 
 David Belcher of The Herald wrote that Minogue looked too old to play a waitress . Sam Wollaston of The Guardian claimed Kylie 's performance was " disappointing " and did not live up to those of Freema Agyeman or Billie Piper in Doctor Who . Jim Shelley of The Mirror stated that Minogue did not " look vivacious enough to be worth all the fuss " . Conversely , Paddy Shennan of the Liverpool Echo accused the makers of cynically including shots of Minogue 's cleavage and legs . Tim Teeman of the Times Online described Astrid as " gutsy " , but commented on Minogue 's " older " appearance and likened her " breathy delivery " to her performance as Charlene Mitchell in Neighbours . In 2012 , Will Salmon of SFX named Astrid 's demise as one of the five worst companion departures , writing that her death circumstance was " a bit daft " and her starlight farewell was a " laughably mawkish scene " . 
 Billie Piper , who portrayed former companion Rose Tyler , commented that it was a " great idea " to cast Minogue , and was disappointed to miss meeting and befriending her on the set of Doctor Who as Tennant had done . The Sun 's selection of top TV babes of 2007 included Minogue as Astrid Peth as well as Agyeman for her Martha Jones Doctor Who role and Piper for her role as Belle de Jour in Secret Diary of a Call Girl .

 = Kantian ethics = 
 Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant . The theory , developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism , is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will ; an action can only be good if its maxim – the principle behind it – is duty to the moral law . Central to Kant 's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative , which acts on all people , regardless of their interests or desires . Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways . His principle of universalisability requires that , for an action to be permissible , it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring . His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end , but always also as ends in themselves . The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will , while Kant 's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom . Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties . A perfect duty , such as the duty not to lie , always holds true ; an imperfect duty , such as the duty to give to charity , can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place . 
 American philosopher Louis Pojman has cited Pietism , political philosopher Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau , the modern debate between rationalism and empiricism , and the influence of natural law as influences on the development of Kant 's ethics . Other philosophers have argued that Kant 's parents and his teacher , Martin Knutzen , influenced his ethics . Those influenced by Kantian ethics include philosopher Jürgen Habermas , political philosopher John Rawls , and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan . German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel criticised Kant for not providing specific enough detail in his moral theory to affect decision @-@ making and for denying human nature . German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer argued that ethics should attempt to describe how people behave and criticised Kant for being prescriptive . Michael Stocker has argued that acting out of duty can diminish other moral motivations such as friendship , while Marcia Baron has defended the theory by arguing that duty does not diminish other motivations . The Catholic Church has criticised Kant 's ethics as contradictory and regards Christian ethics as more compatible with virtue ethics . 
 The claim that all humans are due dignity and respect as autonomous agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed upon anyone , and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society . Kant 's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely as a means to an end , leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices . Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they do not treat women as ends . Kant also believed that , because animals do not possess rationality , we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them . Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics : because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth , we must never lie , even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth . 
 = = Outline = = 
 Although all of Kant 's work develops his ethical theory , it is most clearly defined in Groundwork of the <unk> of Morals , Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals . As part of the Enlightenment tradition , Kant based his ethical theory on the belief that reason should be used to determine how people ought to act . He did not attempt to prescribe specific action , but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave . 
 = = = Good will and duty = = = 
 In his combined works , Kant constructed the basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty . Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will . No other virtue has this status because every other virtue can be used to achieve immoral ends ( the virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person , for example ) . The good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions . Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends . 
 For Kant a good will is a broader conception than a will which acts from duty . A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances in order to keep the moral law . A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions . Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth . This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless ( these still deserve approval and encouragement ) , but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty . 
 Kant 's conception of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly . Although duty often constrains people and prompts them to act against their inclinations , it still comes from an agent 's volition : they desire to keep the moral law . Thus , when an agent performs an action from duty it is because the rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations . Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy , when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them . 
 = = = = Perfect and imperfect duties = = = = 
 Applying the categorical imperative , duties arise because failure to fulfil them would either result in a contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will . The former are classified as perfect duties , the latter as imperfect . A perfect duty always holds true — there is a perfect duty to tell the truth , so we must never lie . An imperfect duty allows flexibility — beneficence is an imperfect duty because we are not obliged to be completely beneficent at all times , but may choose the times and places in which we are . Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties : if a conflict between duties arises , the perfect duty must be followed . 
 = = = Categorical Imperative = = = 
 Main Article : Categorical Imperative 
 The primary formulation of Kant 's ethics is the categorical imperative , from which he derived four further formulations . Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives . A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey if we want to satisfy our desires : ' go to the doctor ' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well . A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires : everyone has a duty to not lie , regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so . These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason , rather than contingent facts about an agent . Unlike hypothetical imperatives , which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to , we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents . We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents ; therefore , rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Kant 's first formulation of the Categorical Imperative is that of <unk> : 
 Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . 
 When someone acts , it is according to a rule , or maxim . For Kant , an act is only permissible if one is willing for the maxim that allows the action to be a universal law by which everyone acts . Maxims fail this test if they produce either a contradiction in conception or a contradiction in the will when universalized . A contradiction in conception happens when , if a maxim were to be universalized , it ceases to make sense because the " ... maxim would necessarily destroy itself as soon as it was made a universal law . " For example , if the maxim ' It is permissible to break promises ' was universalized , no one would trust any promises made , so the idea of a promise would become meaningless ; the maxim would be self @-@ contradictory because , when universalized , promises cease to be meaningful . The maxim is not moral because it is logically impossible to <unk> — we could not conceive of a world where this maxim was universalized . A maxim can also be immoral if it creates a contradiction in the will when universalized . This does not mean a logical contradiction , but that universalizing the maxim leads to a state of affairs that no rational being would desire . For example , Driver argues that the maxim ' I will not give to charity ' produces a contradiction in the will when universalized because a world where no one gives to charity would be undesirable for the person who acts by that maxim . 
 Kant believed that morality is the objective law of reason : just as objective physical laws necessitate physical actions ( apples fall down because of gravity , for example ) , objective rational laws necessitate rational actions . He thus believed that a perfectly rational being must also be perfectly moral because a perfectly rational being subjectively finds it necessary to do what is rationally necessary . Because humans are not perfectly rational ( they partly act by instinct ) , Kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with objective rational laws , which he called conformity obligation . Kant argued that the objective law of reason is a priori , existing externally from rational being . Just as physical laws exist prior to physical beings , rational laws ( morality ) exist prior to rational beings . Therefore , according to Kant , rational morality is universal and cannot change depending on circumstance . 
 = = = = Humanity as an end in itself = = = = 
 Kant 's second formulation of the Categorical Imperative is to treat humanity as an end in itself : 
 Act in such a way that you treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of another , always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means . 
 Kant argued that rational beings can never be treated merely as means to ends ; they must always also be treated as ends themselves , requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected . This derives from Kant 's claim that reason motivates morality : it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings , including other people . A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely as a means to an end , so they must always be treated as an end . Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity : that which is rationally willed is morally right . Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means , it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such . This does not mean that we can never treat a human as a means to an end , but that when we do , we also treat him as an end in himself . 
 = = = = Formula of autonomy = = = = 
 Kant 's Formula of Autonomy expresses the idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their rational will , rather than any outside influence . Kant believed that any moral law motivated by the desire to fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative , leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will . This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that , as moral laws must be universalisable , what is required of one person is required of all . 
 = = = = Kingdom of Ends = = = = 
 Another formulation of Kant 's Categorical Imperative is the Kingdom of Ends : 
 A rational being must always regard himself as giving laws either as member or as sovereign in a kingdom of ends which is rendered possible by the freedom of will . 
 This formulation requires that actions be considered as if their maxim is to provide a law for a hypothetical Kingdom of Ends . Accordingly , people have an obligation to act upon principles that a community of rational agents would accept as laws . In such a community , each individual would only accept maxims that can govern every member of the community without treating any member merely as a means to an end . Although the Kingdom of Ends is an ideal — the actions of other people and events of nature ensure that actions with good intentions sometimes result in harm — we are still required to act categorically , as legislators of this ideal kingdom . 
 = = Influences on Kantian ethics = = 
 Philosopher Louis Pojman has suggested four strong influences on Kant 's ethics . The first is the Lutheran sect Pietism , to which Kant 's parents subscribed . Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief , more concerned with feeling than rationality . Kant believed that rationality is required , but that it should be concerned with morality and good will . Second is the political philosopher Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau , whose work , The Social Contract , influenced Kant 's view on the fundamental worth of human beings . Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant 's ethics . Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism , which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge , rather than something based on human desire . Natural law ( the belief that the moral law is determined by nature ) and intuitionism ( the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths ) were , according to Pojman , also influential for Kant . 
 Biographer of Kant , Manfred Kuhn , suggested that the values Kant 's parents held , of " hard work , honesty , cleanliness , and independence ” , set him an example and influenced him more than their Pietism did . In the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy , Michael <unk> suggests that Kant was influenced by his teacher , Martin Knutzen , himself influenced by the work of Christian Wolff and John Locke , and who introduced Kant to the work of English physicist Isaac Newton .

 = = = Influenced by Kantian ethics = = = 
 = = = = Jürgen Habermas = = = = 
 German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has proposed a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics . He proposes that action should be based on communication between those involved , in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all . Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation , Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached . Like Kantian ethics , discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory , in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions . It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable , in a similar way to Kant 's ethics . 
 Habermas argues that his ethical theory is an improvement on Kant 's ethics . He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant 's ethics . Kant distinguished between the phenomena world , which can be sensed and experienced by humans , and the <unk> , or spiritual world , which is inaccessible to humans . This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent : although a human is bound in the phenomenal world , their actions are free in the intelligible world . For Habermas , morality arises from discourse , which is made necessary by their rationality and needs , rather than their freedom . 
 = = = = John Rawls = = = = 
 The social contract theory of political philosopher John Rawls , developed in his work A Theory of Justice , was influenced by Kant 's ethics . Rawls argued that a just society would be fair . To achieve this fairness , he proposed a hypothetical moment prior to the existence of a society , at which the society is ordered : this is the original position . This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance , where no one knows what their own position in society will be , preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result . Rawls ' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free , equal , and moral ; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality , which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice . Rawls dismissed much of Kant 's dualism , arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics , once reformulated , is clearer without it — he described this as one of the goals of A Theory of Justice . 
 = = = = Jacques Lacan = = = = 
 French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian ethics in his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade . Lacan argued that Sade 's maxim of jouissance — the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment — is morally acceptable by Kant 's criteria because it can be universalised . He proposed that , while Kant presented human freedom as critical to the moral law , Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance .

 Philosopher <unk> O 'Neill , who studied under John Rawls at Oxford University , is a contemporary Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach to issues of social justice . O 'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted <unk> or assumption . She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealising humans as autonomous beings , without any social context or life goals , though maintains that Kant 's ethics can be read without such an idealisation . O 'Neill prefers Kant 's conception of reason as practical and available to be used by humans , rather than as principles attached to every human being . Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all . If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle , then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it . To use reason , and to reason with other people , we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted . In this way , O 'Neill reached Kant 's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy . This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles , but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not . 
 From this model of Kantian ethics , O 'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice . She argues that the rejection of certain principles , such as deception and coercion , provides a starting point for basic conceptions of justice , which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty . Nevertheless , she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding : there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non @-@ universalisable principles , such as injury . 
 = = = = Marcia Baron = = = = 
 In his paper The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories , philosopher Michael Stocker challenges Kantian ethics ( and all modern ethical theories ) by arguing that actions from duty lack certain moral value . He gives the example of Smith , who visits his friend in hospital out of duty , rather than because of the friendship ; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing . Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point . After presenting a number of reasons that we might find acting out of duty objectionable , she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is . Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong , but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty @-@ bound to do . Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal : one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships . Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive — that is , a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done , rather the prompts specific actions . She argues that , seen this way , duty neither reveals a deficiency in one 's natural inclinations to act , nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship . For Baron , being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act ; rather , it entails that considerations of duty are always action @-@ guiding . A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions , such as questions of character . These should guide moral agents to act from duty . 
 = = = Critics of Kantian ethics = = = 
 = = = = G. W. F Hegel = = = = 
 German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel presented two main criticisms of Kantian ethics . He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific information about what people should do because Kant 's moral law is solely a principle of non @-@ contradiction . He argued that Kant 's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality . To illustrate this point , Hegel and his followers have presented a number of cases in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer . Hegel used Kant 's example of being trusted with another man 's money to argue that Kant 's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing , because either answer can entail contradictions . He also used the example of helping the poor : if everyone helped the poor , there would be no poor left to help , so beneficence would be impossible if universalised , making it immoral according to Kant 's model . Hegel 's second criticism was that Kant 's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire . For Hegel , it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason . This means that , by not addressing the tension between self @-@ interest and morality , Kant 's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral . 
 = = = = Arthur Schopenhauer = = = = 
 German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant 's belief that ethics should concern what ought to be done , insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and interpret what actually happens . Whereas Kant presented an idealised version of what ought to be done in a perfect world , <unk> argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world , capable of being presented as a solution to the world 's problems . Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics , arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not the most important part of the discipline . Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught — a person is either virtuous or is not — he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people 's behaviour , rather than presenting unattainable universal laws . 
 = = = = Friedrich Nietzsche = = = = 
 Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche criticised all contemporary moral systems , with a special focus on Christian and Kantian ethics . He argued that all modern ethical systems share two problematic characteristics : first , they make a metaphysical claim about the nature of humanity , which must be accepted for the system to have any normative force ; and second , the system benefits the interests of certain people , often over those of others . Although Nietzsche 's primary objection is not that metaphysical claims about humanity are untenable ( he also objected to ethical theories that do not make such claims ) , his two main targets — Kantianism and Christianity — do make metaphysical claims , which therefore feature prominently in Nietzsche 's criticism . 
 Nietzsche rejected fundamental components of Kant 's ethics , particularly his argument that morality , God and immorality can be shown through reason . Nietzsche cast suspicion on the use of moral intuition , which Kant used as the foundation of his morality , arguing that it has no normative force in ethics . He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant 's moral psychology , such as the will and pure reason . Like Kant , Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy ; however , he rejected Kant 's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others . A naturalist reading of Nietzsche 's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant 's conception of reason and desire . Under the Kantian model , reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision . Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations ; thus , when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives , it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another . This is in direct contrast with Kant 's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct ; instead , it is just another instinct . There is thus no self capable of standing back and making a decision ; the decision the self makes is simply determined by the strongest drive . Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche 's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self capable of standing back in the Kantian sense . For an individual to create values of their own , which is a key idea in Nietzsche 's philosophy , they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent . Even if the agent is influenced by their drives , he must regard them as his own , which undermines Nietzsche 's conception of autonomy . 
 = = = = John Stuart Mill = = = = 
 Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for not realising that moral laws are justified by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles ( that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought ) . Mill argued that Kant 's ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism . As basis for morality , Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant 's reliance on reason , and can better explain why certain actions are right or wrong . 
 = = = = Virtue ethics = = = = 
 Virtue ethics is a form of ethical theory which emphasises the character of an agent , rather than specific acts ; many of its proponents have criticised Kant 's deontological approach to ethics . Elizabeth Anscombe criticised modern ethical theories , including Kantian ethics , for their obsession with law and obligation . As well as arguing that theories which rely on a universal moral law are too rigid , Anscombe suggested that , because a moral law implies a moral lawgiver , they are irrelevant in modern secular society . In his work After Virtue , Alasdair MacIntyre criticises Kant 's formulation of universalisability , arguing that various trivial and immoral maxims can pass the test , such as " Keep all your promises throughout your entire life except one " . He further challenges Kant 's formulation of humanity as an ends in itself by arguing that Kant provided no reason to treat others as means : the maxim " Let everyone except me be treated as a means " , though seemingly immoral , can be universalised . Bernard Williams argues that , by abstracting persons from character , Kant <unk> persons and morality and Philippa Foot identified Kant as one of a select group of philosophers responsible for the neglect of virtue by analytic philosophy . 
 = = = = Catholic Church = = = = 
 The Catholic Church has criticised Kantian ethics for its apparent contradiction , arguing that humans being co @-@ legislators of morality contradicts the claim that morality is a priori . If something is universally a priori ( i.e. , existing <unk> prior to experience ) , then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans , who have not always existed 
 The theory of the categorical imperative is , moreover , inconsistent . According to it the human will is the highest <unk> authority , and yet subject to precepts enjoined on it . 
 Roman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers criticised the modern desire for ethics to be autonomous and free from the authorities such as the Church , a development he partially attributed to thinkers such as Kant . Pinckaers saw this as potentially threatening to the legitimacy of the Magisterium , but maintained that the link between the gospel and the moral law , and the shortcomings of human reason , leave a place for the moral authority of the Church . Pinckaers regarded Christian ethics as closer to the virtue ethics of Aristotle than Kant 's ethics . He presented virtue ethics as freedom for excellence , which regards freedom as acting in accordance with nature to develop one 's virtues . Initially , this requires following rules — but the intention is that the agent develop virtuously , and regard acting morally as a joy . This is in contrast with freedom of indifference , which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant . On this view , freedom is set against nature : free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions . There is no development or progress in an agent 's virtue , merely the forming of habit . This is closer to Kant 's view of ethics , because Kant 's conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by their emotions , and is set in contrast with <unk> 's conception of Christian ethics . 
 = = Applications = = 
 = = = Medical ethics = = = 
 Kant believed that the shared ability of humans to reason should be the basis of morality , and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant . He therefore believed that all humans should have the right to common dignity and respect . Margaret Eaton argues that , according to Kant 's ethics , a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone , even if they were the patient themselves . For example , a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so . She also argues that Kant 's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment , making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients . Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient , so they must be informed of all facts , even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient . Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant 's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society , but are always treated as rational people with their own goals . Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally , not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non @-@ rational means . He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses , the difference being the result of non @-@ rational idiosyncrasies . Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient , Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non @-@ rational response - could be acceptable . 
 In her work How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion , Susan Feldman argues that abortion should be defended according to Kantian ethics . She proposed that a woman should be treated as a dignified autonomous person , with control over their body , as Kant suggested . She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics , requiring abortion to be the mother 's decision . Dean Harris has noted that , if Kantian ethics is to be used in the discussion of abortion , it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person . Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals . Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age ( such as babies or fetuses ) or mental disability , agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves , equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion . 
 = = = Sexual ethics = = = 
 Kant viewed humans as being subject to the animalistic desires of self @-@ preservation , species @-@ preservation , and the preservation of enjoyment . He argued that humans have a duty to avoid maxims that harm or degrade themselves , including suicide , sexual degradation , and drunkenness . This led Kant to regard sexual intercourse as degrading because it reduces humans to an object of pleasure . He admitted sex only within marriage , which he regarded as " a merely animal union " . He believed that masturbation is worse than suicide , reducing a person 's status to below that of an animal ; he argued that rape should be punished with castration and that bestiality requires expulsion from society . Feminist philosopher Catharine MacKinnon has argued that many contemporary practices would be deemed immoral by Kant 's standards because they <unk> women . Sexual harassment , prostitution and pornography , she argues , objectify women and do not meet Kant 's standard of human autonomy . Commercial sex has been criticised for turning both parties into objects ( and thus using them as a means to an end ) ; mutual consent is problematic because in consenting , people choose to objectify themselves . Alan <unk> has noted that more liberal Kantian ethicists believe that , depending on other contextual factors , the consent of women can vindicate their participation in pornography and prostitution . 
 = = = Animal ethics = = = 
 Because Kant viewed rationality as the basis for being a moral patient — one due moral consideration — he believed that animals have no moral rights . Animals , according to Kant , are not rational , thus one cannot behave immorally towards them . Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals , Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes towards human beings : if we become accustomed to harming animals , then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable . 
 Ethicist Tom Regan rejects Kant 's assessment of the moral worth of animals on three main points : First , he rejects Kant 's claim that animals are not self @-@ conscious . He then challenges Kant 's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make moral judgement . Regan argues that , if a being 's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgement , then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration . Regan finally argues that Kant 's assertion that animals exist merely as a means to an ends is unsupported ; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that , like humans , they have their own ends . 
 = = = Lying = = = 
 Kant believed that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that we ought not to lie in any circumstances , even if we are trying to bring about good consequences , such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim . Kant argued that , because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be , the result might be unexpectedly harmful . Therefore , we ought to act to avoid the known wrong — lying — rather than to avoid a potential wrong . If there are harmful consequences , we are blameless because we acted according to our duty . Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently : the maxim ' I will lie to save an innocent life ' can be universalised . However , this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end , which we have a duty to avoid doing . Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant 's example . 
 = Electric Company ( football ) = 
 The Electric Company was the nickname of the offensive line of the Buffalo Bills during the mid @-@ 1970s that helped running back O.J. Simpson establish numerous National Football League ( NFL ) all @-@ time records and earn numerous statistical titles . The nickname is sometimes more loosely used to refer to the Electric Company Offense for the Bills offensive unit or the Electric Company Buffalo Bills for the teams of this era . 
 During these years , Simpson established NFL records for single @-@ season rushing yards ( 1973 ) , single @-@ season yards from scrimmage ( 1973 ) , single @-@ season rushing yards per game ( 1973 ) , single @-@ season touchdowns ( 1975 ) , single @-@ season 200 @-@ yard games ( 1973 ) , consecutive 100 @-@ yard games ( 1972 – 73 ) , single @-@ game rushing yards ( 1973 & 1976 ) and career 200 @-@ rushing yard games . His single @-@ season rushing yards per game and career 200 @-@ yard rushing games records still stand . Simpson was selected to the Pro Bowl team and as an All @-@ Pro performer each year between 1972 and 1976 . He won the rushing title in four of those five seasons . During this time period , Simpson became the only running back to twice have 200 @-@ yard rushing efforts in back @-@ to @-@ back games . Simpson was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his exploits . 
 Although the Buffalo Bills had winning records during the 1973 , 1974 and 1975 seasons , only the 1974 Buffalo Bills made the NFL playoffs during the 8 @-@ team format era . However , in the 1974 – 75 NFL playoffs they were eliminated by the eventual Super Bowl IX champion 1974 Pittsburgh Steelers .

 Pro Football Hall of Famer Joe DeLamielleure played right offensive guard and was selected to the Pro Bowl for the 1975 Buffalo Bills – 1979 Buffalo Bills ( and the 1980 Cleveland Browns ) and was All @-@ Pro the first three of those seasons . 
 College Football Hall of Famer Reggie McKenzie , who was the left guard , was selected to the All @-@ Pro team following the 1973 NFL season and played for the Bills from 1972 – 1982 . 
 Paul Seymour had been a member of the 1972 College Football All @-@ America Team as an offensive tackle for the Michigan Wolverines after having played two season at tight end . He returned to the tight end position as a professional and became the team 's starting tight end for five seasons starting in 1973 . 
 Dave Foley started at left tackle during all of Simpson 's five consecutive Pro Bowl years and remained with the team through the 1977 season . Foley was selected to the 1974 Pro Bowl team . 
 Mike Montler started half the games at center in 1973 and remained the starter through the 1976 season . Right tackle Donnie Green was drafted by the Bills in the 1971 NFL Draft and remained with the Bills through 1977 . 
 Lou Saban was coach of the team from 1972 through part of the 1976 season , when he gave way to Jim Ringo who was the offensive line coach for the Bills . 
 Other members of the Electric Company included center Bruce Jarvis who started 8 games in 1973 , but suffered a career @-@ ending knee injury that season . During Simpson 's first All @-@ Pro season and first rushing title in 1972 , before DeLamielleure was drafted in the 1973 NFL Draft , Bob <unk> and Dick Hart were listed at right guard . Jan White was listed at tight end before Seymour was drafted in the same 1973 draft . Also in 1972 , Remi Prudhomme and John Matlock were listed at center . The beginning of the Electric Company era is often considered to be 1973 . That year the Bills moved to Rich Stadium and broke a skid of six consecutive losing seasons , and Simpson started breaking records . 
 When the nickname is expanded to include the whole offense , quarterback Joe Ferguson who was part of the Bills ' 1973 NFL Draft class along with DeLamielleure and Seymour is also considered to be a member . Fullback Jim Braxton , who became the starter in 1972 , is also mentioned as part of the Electric Company . Even wide receivers Bob Chandler and J.D. Hill are associated with the Electric Company .

 Simpson 's single @-@ season rushing yards ( 2003 set in 1973 ) and single @-@ season yards from scrimmage ( <unk> set in 1973 ) records were eclipsed in Eric Dickerson 's 1984 season , but have not been eclipsed on a yards per game basis yet because they were set in 14 games . Simpson 's 1975 single @-@ seasons touchdowns record ( 23 set in 14 games ) lasted until John Riggins posted 24 in 1983 in 16 games . However , the first person to post more touchdowns per game was Priest Holmes who totaled 27 in 2003 . On September 16 , 1973 , Simpson broke Willie Ellison 's 247 @-@ yard single game record with a 250 @-@ yard effort against the New York Jets . On November 25 , 1976 , Simpson broke his own single @-@ game rushing yards record by posting 273 yards . Walter Payton then recorded a 275 @-@ yard effort less than a year later on November 20 , 1977 . Simpson 's six career 200 @-@ yard games remains an NFL record . Earl Campbell and Ricky Williams have also posted back @-@ to @-@ back 200 @-@ yard games , but unlike Simpson they each only have done so once . When Simpson rushed for 100 yards in each of the first five games of the 1973 season it gave him seven consecutive 100 @-@ yard games , which was an NFL record . That record has been broken several times including back @-@ to @-@ back seasons when Payton took the record to 9 in 1985 and Marcus Allen increased it to 11 in 1986 . Finally in 1997 , Barry Sanders posted 14 consecutive 100 @-@ yard efforts .

 Simpson earned the NFL rushing titles in 1972 , 1973 , 1975 and 1976 . He led the league in total touchdowns and total points scored in 1975 , and he led in rushing touchdowns in both 1973 and 1975 . He led the league in yards from scrimmage in 1973 , 1975 and 1976 and in all @-@ purpose yards in 1973 and 1976 .

 The nickname for the offensive line was a reference to O.J. " Juice " Simpson . The offensive line earned its nickname for its ability to " turn on the juice , " which was a metaphor for unleashing Simpson , who at the time was the best running back in the National Football League and the first running back to eclipse 2000 yards ' rushing in a single season . Simpson gave the offensive line its nickname . 
 = Italian ironclad Sicilia = 
 Sicilia was the second of three Re Umberto @-@ class ironclad battleships built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) . The ship , named for the island of Sicily , was laid down in Venice in November 1884 , launched in July 1891 , and completed in May 1895 . She was armed with a main battery of four 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 340 mm ) guns and had a top speed of 20 @.@ 3 knots ( 37 @.@ 6 km / h ; 23 @.@ 4 mph ) , though this high speed came at the cost of armor protection . 
 Sicilia spent the first decade of her career in the Active Squadron of the Italian fleet . Thereafter , she was transferred to the Reserve Squadron , and by 1911 , she was part of the Training Division . She took part in the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 , where she escorted convoys to North Africa and supported Italian forces ashore by bombarding Ottoman troops . She was thereafter used as a depot ship for the new dreadnought battleship Giulio Cesare . During World War I , she continued in service as a depot ship , and later in the war she was converted into a repair ship . Sicilia was stricken in 1923 and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Sicilia was 127 @.@ 6 meters ( 419 ft ) long overall ; she had a beam of 23 @.@ 44 m ( 76 @.@ 9 ft ) and an average draft of 8 @.@ 83 m ( 29 @.@ 0 ft ) . She displaced 13 @,@ 058 metric tons ( 12 @,@ 852 long tons ; 14 @,@ 394 short tons ) normally and up to 14 @,@ 842 t ( 14 @,@ 608 long tons ; 16 @,@ 361 short tons ) at full load . Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical compound steam engines each driving a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by eighteen coal @-@ fired , cylindrical fire @-@ tube boilers . Her engines produced a top speed of 20 @.@ 1 knots ( 37 @.@ 2 km / h ; 23 @.@ 1 mph ) at 19 @,@ 131 indicated horsepower ( 14 @,@ 266 kW ) . Specific figures for her cruising radius have not survived , but the ships of her class could steam for 4 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 400 to 11 @,@ 100 km ; 4 @,@ 600 to 6 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of 736 officers and men . 
 Sicilia was armed with a main battery of four 13 @.@ 5 in ( 343 mm ) 30 @-@ caliber guns , mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one on either end of the ship . She carried a secondary battery of eight 6 in ( 152 mm ) 40 @-@ cal. guns placed singly in shielded mounts atop the upper deck , with four on each broadside . Close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of sixteen 4 @.@ 7 in ( 119 mm ) guns in casemates in the upper deck , eight on each broadside . These were supported by twenty 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) 43 @-@ cal. guns and ten 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns . As was customary for capital ships of the period , she carried five 17 @.@ 7 in ( 450 mm ) torpedo tubes in above @-@ water launchers . The ship was lightly armored for her size . She was protected by belt armor that was 4 in ( 102 mm ) thick , an armored deck that was 3 in ( 76 mm ) thick , and her conning tower was armored with 11 @.@ 8 in ( 300 mm ) of steel plate . The turrets had 4 in thick faces and the supporting barbettes had 13 @.@ 75 in ( 349 mm ) thick steel . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Sicilia was named after the island of Sicily . She was built by the Venetian Arsenal in Venice . Her keel was laid down on 3 November 1884 , and her completed hull was launched on 6 July 1891 . At her launching ceremony , the new ship was christened by Queen Margherita . Fitting @-@ out work was completed on 4 May 1895 , after which the ship entered service with the Italian fleet . Sicilia took part in an international naval demonstration in 1897 off Crete during a period of tension between Greece and the Ottoman Empire that culminated in the Greco @-@ Turkish War . At the time , Sicilia was the flagship of the 1st Division , which also included her two sister ships , the protected cruisers Giovanni Bausan and Vesuvio , and the torpedo cruiser Euridice . By 1899 , Sicilia had been assigned to the 2nd Division , which also included the ironclads Affondatore and Castelfidardo , and the torpedo cruisers Partenope and Urania . 
 For 1903 , the Active Squadron was on active service for seven months , with the rest of the year spent with reduced crews . In 1904 – 05 , Sicilia and her sisters were still in service with the Active Squadron , which was kept in service for nine months of the year , with three months in reduced commission . The following year , the ships were transferred to the Reserve Squadron , along with the three Ruggiero di Lauria @-@ class ironclads and the ironclad Enrico Dandolo , three cruisers , and sixteen torpedo boats . This squadron only entered active service for two months of the year for training maneuvers , and the rest of the year was spent with reduced crews . Sicilia was still in the Reserve Squadron in 1908 , along with her two sisters and the two Ammiraglio di Saint Bon @-@ class battleships . By this time , the Reserve Squadron was kept in service for seven months of the year . 
 = = = Italo @-@ Turkish War = = = 
 On 29 September 1911 , Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya . At the time , Sicilia and her two sisters were assigned to the Training Division , along with the old armored cruiser Carlo Alberto , with Sicilia serving as the flagship of Rear Admiral Raffaele Borea Ricci D 'Olmo . On 3 – 4 October , Sicilia and her sisters were tasked with bombarding Fort Sultanje , which was protecting the western approach to Tripoli . The ships used their 6 @-@ inch guns to attack the fort to preserve their stock of 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch shells . By the morning of the 4th , the ships ' gunfire had silenced the guns in the fort , allowing landing forces to go ashore and capture the city . These included a contingent led by Sicilia 's captain . The ships of the Training Division thereafter alternated between Tripoli and Khoms to support the Italian garrisons in the two cities ; this included repulsing a major Ottoman attack on Tripoli over 23 – 26 October , where Sicilia and Sardegna supported the Italian left flank against concerted Ottoman assaults . In November , Sicilia , Re Umberto , the torpedo cruiser Partenope , the destroyer Fulmine , and the torpedo boat <unk> bombarded the oasis at Taguira , though no Turkish forces were present . The Italians then sent a garrison to protect the oasis . 
 By December , the three ships were stationed in Tripoli , where they were replaced by the old ironclads Italia and Lepanto . Sicilia and her sisters arrived back in La Spezia , where they had their ammunition and supplies replenished . In May 1912 , the Training Division patrolled the coast , but saw no action . The following month , Sicilia and her sisters , along with six torpedo boats , escorted a convoy carrying an infantry brigade to Buscheifa , one of the last ports in Libya still under Ottoman control . The Italian force arrived off the town on 14 June and made a landing ; after taking the city , the Italian forces then moved on to Misrata . Sicilia and the rest of the ships continued supporting the advance until the Italians had secured the city on 20 July . The Training Division then returned to Italy , where they joined the escort for another convoy on 3 August , this time to Zuara , the last port in Ottoman hands . The ships covered the landing two miles east of Zuara two days later , which was joined by supporting attacks from the west and south . With the capture of the city , Italy now controlled the entire Libyan coast . On 14 October the Ottomans agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war .

 She became a depot ship for the new dreadnought battleship Giulio Cesare at Taranto , which was then nearing completion . Sicilia was stricken on 9 July 1914 and slated to be scrapped , but the Regia Marina decided to retain the ship after World War I broke out at the end of the month . On 16 August , the ship was disarmed and returned to service as a depot ship in Taranto for ammunition and sailors . Italy had declared neutrality at the start of World War I , but by July 1915 , the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers . Later in the war , Sicilia was converted into a repair ship . The ship was stricken again in 1923 and thereafter broken up for scrap . 
 = 2015 Eneco Tour = 
 The 2015 Eneco Tour was a road cycling stage race that took place in the Netherlands and Belgium between 10 and 16 August 2015 . It was the 11th edition of the Eneco Tour stage race and was the twenty @-@ first race of the 2015 UCI World Tour . 
 The Eneco Tour is an unusual race in the cycling season : it primarily favours classics riders rather than climbers . The first three stages of the race were suitable for sprinters ; the fourth stage was an individual time trial ; and the final three stages were suitable for the classics riders . Elia Viviani ( Team Sky ) won the first stage and was the first rider to wear the leader 's jersey . Jesper Asselman ( Team Roompot ) took over the lead after the second stage due to time bonuses , before losing it in the time trial to Jos van Emden ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) . Wilco Kelderman ( also LottoNL – Jumbo ) took the lead after the fifth stage , but lost it to Tim Wellens ( Lotto – Soudal ) the following day . Wellens defended his lead on the final stage to win his second successive Eneco Tour ; he had been the defending champion after victory in 2014 . Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) was second , with Kelderman third . 
 The points classification was won by André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) and the combativity award by Gijs Van Hoecke ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) . Lotto – Soudal also won the team classification .

 The 17 UCI World Tour teams were automatically entitled and obliged to start the race ; three UCI Professional Continental teams were invited as wildcards to form a twenty @-@ team peloton . Each team entered eight riders to form a 160 @-@ rider peloton ; one rider , BMC Racing Team 's Daniel Oss , withdrew before the race due to a fall in training , so 159 riders started the race . 
 = = Schedule = = 
 The first three stages of the race were flat road stages , with no classified climbs . All of these stages were expected to suit the sprinters , though crosswinds had the potential to make the stages more difficult . The decisive section of the race was expect to start with the individual time trial on stage 4 . The final three stages of the race were expected to suit classics riders : the fifth and sixth stages were hilly stages in the style of the Ardennes classics , while the final stage used roads that feature in the cobbled classics . One change to the regulations in 2015 was the introduction of a " golden kilometre " , a series of three intermediate sprints on each road stage approximately 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) before the finish . The first three riders across each of these sprint points won bonus seconds in the general classification . This replicated the system from the 2015 Tour of Belgium , where the golden kilometre system had played a part in the victory of Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 Most World Tour stage races are won by strong climbers . The Eneco Tour is unusual because the favourites for overall victory were classics riders — those who perform strongly in the Ardennes classics and the cobbled classics that feature in the early part of the cycling season . 
 The defending champion was Tim Wellens ( Lotto – Soudal ) , who won the 2014 Eneco Tour in the penultimate stage . He was one of the favourites again , although Cycling Weekly predicted that he would be given less freedom to attack as the defending champion . One other former winner of the race took part in 2015 : Lars Boom ( Astana ) had won in 2012 . He was another strong favourite in 2015 , especially as the race included a longer time trial than other recent editions of the race . Other favourites included Niki Terpstra ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , who was third in 2012 , Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) , who was in strong form after coming close to victory in the Clásica de San Sebastián , Philippe Gilbert ( also BMC ) and Wilco Kelderman ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) . 
 The first three stages of the race were flat and therefore particularly suitable for sprinters . Prominent sprinters taking part in the race included André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) , Giacomo Nizzolo ( Trek Factory Racing ) , Elia Viviani ( Team Sky ) , Andrea Guardini ( Astana ) and Edward Theuns ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) .

 10 August 2015 – Bolsward to Bolsward , 183 @.@ 5 km ( 114 @.@ 0 mi ) 
 The first stage was a 183 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 114 @.@ 0 mi ) flat stage in the Netherlands , starting and finishing in Bolsward . The race began with a large loop south of the town , through <unk> and then north along the coast from <unk> , then returning to Bolsward . After the first time across the finish line , the race turned north for a shorter loop , through <unk> and then south along the coast from Harlingen , before returning to Bolsward for the second time across the finish line . There were then two laps of a 20 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 12 @.@ 7 mi ) finishing circuit . The stage contained no climbs . 
 The day 's early breakaway was formed by Nathan Haas ( Cannondale – Garmin ) , Frederik Veuchelen ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) , Laurens De Vreese ( Astana ) , Jesper Asselman ( Team Roompot ) , Nico Denz ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , and David Boucher ( FDJ ) . The racing conditions were fairly easy , as there were no crosswinds . The breakaway 's lead was over seven minutes at one point , but this was quickly closed down by the peloton and reduced to three minutes with 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) remaining . There were three intermediate sprints in the space of 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) , described as a " golden kilometre " , which were won by Denz , Asselman and de Vreese respectively . The breakaway was then caught and Team Sky and Lotto – Soudal drove the peloton towards the finish line . Sky 's Andy Fenn was leading out his teammate Elia Viviani and , with 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) remaining , Viviani was able to follow the wheel of André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) . Greipel opened his sprint with a long distance to the finish line and Viviani was able to follow him and then come past him to take the stage victory . Danny van Poppel ( Trek Factory Racing ) finished second and Jean @-@ Pierre Drucker ( BMC Racing Team ) third , with Greipel in fourth place .

 11 August 2015 – Breda to Breda , 180 km ( 110 mi ) 
 The second stage of the race started in the south of the Netherlands , starting and finishing in Breda . The course was 180 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 112 @.@ 3 mi ) in length and , like the first stage , was entirely flat . The stage began with a loop to the south of Breda , around <unk> , then crossed the finish line to begin a much larger loop . This second loop took the riders north to <unk> , then south @-@ west to <unk> and south @-@ east to Meer , where the Tour entered Belgium for the first time . Here the route turned north again , passing to the east of <unk> and returning to cross the finish line for the second time . The final part of the stage was two laps of a finishing circuit to the east of Breda ; these laps included the golden kilometre . 
 The early breakaway was formed by two riders , Gijs Van Hoecke ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) and , for the second day running , Jesper Asselman . The two riders briefly had a lead of seven minutes , but this was controlled by Team Sky , especially Ian Stannard . Asselman allowed Van Hoecke to win the two early sprints for the combativity jersey and , in return , was allowed to win all three sprints in the golden kilometre . The two riders had a two @-@ minute advantage at this point . In the main peloton , Philippe Gilbert and Andriy Hryvko ( Astana ) competed for the remaining one @-@ second bonuses : Gilbert won the first and third ; Hryvko won the second . Asselman and Van Hoecke were then caught by the peloton — led by Lotto – Soudal — with 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining . Despite several crashes in the final kilometres of the stage , the peloton came to the finish together . Etixx – Quick @-@ Step attempted to lead out Tom Boonen as they entered the final 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) , but Lotto @-@ Soudal were able to bring Greipel to the front to open his sprint with 150 metres ( 490 ft ) to the finish line . He finished comfortably ahead of Guarnieri , with Boonen in third . 
 Asselman finished in 78th place on the stage , in the same time as Greipel . As a result of the bonus seconds won in the golden kilometre , he moved into the overall lead of the race . Greipel was in second place , five seconds behind and on the same time as Elia Viviani . This was the first time that any rider from Team Roompot had worn a leader 's jersey in a UCI race .

 12 August 2015 – Beveren to Ardooie , 171 @.@ 9 km ( 106 @.@ 8 mi ) 
 The third stage of the race took place entirely in Belgium . It was a 171 @.@ 9 @-@ kilometre ( 106 @.@ 8 mi ) course that contained no classified climbs ; it was the final flat stage of the race . The route began in Beveren with a circuit around the municipality . The course then took the riders west as far as <unk> , before turning south @-@ west towards Ardooie . After the riders crossed the finish line for the first time , they began two laps of a finishing circuit around the town ; these included the golden kilometre . 
 The breakaway was formed by three riders early in the race . These were David Boucher ( FDJ ) , Edward Theuns ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) and Frederik Veuchelen ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) . They built a lead that reached four minutes , but were always under control by the peloton . Team Roompot did a lot of the work at the front of the peloton controlling the breakaway . With 48 kilometres ( 30 mi ) remaining , Gorka Izagirre ( Movistar Team ) and Hugo Houle ( AG2R La Mondiale ) touched wheels and crashed after a sharp corner . Houle continued , but Izagirre was forced to abandon the race and was taken to hospital in an ambulance following a blow to his head on a traffic signal . Theuns won all three of the golden kilometre sprints ; the nine bonus seconds moved him up to fifth place overall at the end of the stage . The breakaway was caught with 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) remaining and , apart from a brief attack from Nathan Haas ( Cannondale – Garmin ) , the peloton came to the finish together . 
 The peloton was led first by Giant – Alpecin and then by Lotto – Soudal and Etixx – Quick @-@ Step . The peloton split slightly due to Etixx – Quick @-@ Step 's work . Arnaud Démare ( FDJ ) was the first to start sprinting . Tom Boonen , however , was able to follow him , despite clashing wheels at one point , and came past in the final metres to take the stage victory . Démare was second with Viviani third . Boonen moved up into second place overall following the stage , one second behind Asselman and on the same time as Viviani . 
 After the stage , Boucher was thrown out of the race by his team . He had recently been told that his contract would not be renewed and had disobeyed team orders not to go in the day 's breakaway .

 13 August 2015 – Hoogerheide to Hoogerheide , 13 @.@ 9 km ( 8 @.@ 6 mi ) ( ITT ) 
 Stage 4 was a 13 @.@ 9 @-@ kilometre ( 8 @.@ 6 mi ) individual time trial around Hoogerheide in the Netherlands . The course was fairly flat , with a slight downhill section towards the start and a gentle uphill section towards the finish , the <unk> . 
 An early leading time was set by Adriano Malori ( Movistar Team ) , with a time of 16 ' 40 " and an average speed of 49 @.@ 99 km / h ( 31 @.@ 06 mph ) . Soon afterwards , however , that time was beaten by Jos van Emden ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) . Van Emden was seven seconds quicker than Malori and was the first rider to complete the course at an average speed of over 50 km / h ( 31 mph ) . The only other rider to come close to Van Emden 's time was his teammate Wilco Kelderman , who finished the course five seconds behind to take second place . Van Emden won the stage , the first WorldTour victory of the year for LottoNL – Jumbo . Van Emden also moved into the overall lead of the race . 
 Several other contenders for overall victory finished the course in good times . These included BMC 's Greg Van Avermaet and Philippe Gilbert and Astana 's Lars Boom . Etixx – Quick @-@ Step 's riders were less successful , however . Their best @-@ placed rider was Julian <unk> , 41 seconds behind Van Emden . Niki Terpstra , who had been considered a favourite for the overall victory , suffered mechanical problems , changed bikes twice and finished 1 ' 26 " back .

 14 August 2015 – <unk> to Sittard @-@ Geleen , 179 @.@ 6 km ( 111 @.@ 6 mi ) 
 The fifth stage of the race was the first hilly stage , with 23 categorised climbs . Many of these climbs ( known as <unk> ) feature in the Amstel Gold Race . It began in <unk> in the Belgian province of Limburg . The riders completed one and a half laps of a circuit of the town ; this included the first climb of the day , the Muizenberg . The course then left the town to the east , crossing the <unk> , before crossing the border into the Dutch province of Limburg . As the route continued to the east , the riders climbed the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> . The route then turned to the north , though it frequently turned back on itself to take in the various climbs . These included the <unk> , the <unk> , the Eyserbosweg , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> . After this , the route entered two and a half laps of a finishing circuit around Sittard @-@ Geleen . On the two complete laps , the riders climbed the Windraak , the <unk> , the <unk> and the Weg <unk> <unk> . The golden kilometre came on the first lap between the last two of these climbs . After the two complete laps , the riders climbed the Windraak once more , before finishing in Sittard @-@ Geleen . 
 The breakaway was formed after 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) by Dylan van Baarle ( Cannondale – Garmin ) and Johan Le Bon ( FDJ ) . Van Baarle was the better placed of the riders , 29 seconds behind Van Emden , with Le Bon ten seconds further behind . LottoNL – Jumbo controlled the peloton on behalf of Van Emden , assisted by Etixx – Quick @-@ Step . Van Baarle and Le Bon had a lead of five minutes at one point ; this was reduced to three and a half minutes with 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) remaining . The breakaway riders did not contest the bonus seconds in the golden kilometre , though Van Avermaet and Gilbert took the remaining seconds in the main peloton . A heavy thunderstorm started as the riders entered the finishing circuit and disrupted the chasing group , with no team taking responsibility for the chase ; Le Bon and van Baarle had a lead of over two minutes as they entered the final lap . Lars Petter Nordhaug ( Team Sky ) and Lars Boom ( Astana ) both put in brief attacks but soon sat up . The lead was reduced to just over a minute with 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining ; at this point , as the riders crossed the Weg <unk> <unk> , André Greipel put in an attack and was joined by Wellens , Kelderman , Giant – Alpecin 's Georg <unk> and Orica – GreenEDGE 's Magnus Cort to form a chase group . 
 The five @-@ man chase group did not work well together , with only Greipel and Wellens consistently working at the front of the group . Kelderman put in a brief surge on the final climb of the Windraak to reduce van Baarle and Le Bon 's lead , but the group was not able to bring the leading pair back . Van Baarle and Le Bon worked together until the final 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , when Le Bon attacked in the slipstream of one of the motorbikes following the race . Van Baarle continued chasing but , with both riders exhausted from their efforts through the day , he was unable properly to regain contact . Le Bon was able to hold on in the sprint to take the stage victory , with Van Baarle finishing second on the same time . Cort won the sprint for third , with Wellens and Kelderman on the same time . Kelderman took over the race lead , one second ahead of Le Bon , with Van Emden dropping to fourth .

 15 August 2015 – Heerlen to Houffalize , 208 @.@ 6 km ( 129 @.@ 6 mi ) 
 The sixth stage was another hilly stage , with 14 climbs coming in 208 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 129 @.@ 6 mi ) . The race started in the Netherlands , in Heerlen , with a circuit that included the climb of the <unk> . The route left the town to the south , crossing the <unk> and the <unk> before entering Belgium . The route continued to the south as it entered the Ardennes . The riders climbed the Col de <unk> , the Côte la Firme <unk> and the Côte de <unk> on the way to the finishing town of Houffalize . The course first climbed the Côte Saint @-@ Roch ; this climb is part of the Liège – Bastogne – Liège course and is 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) in length with an average gradient of 11 % . The route loops around to the south of the town before entering two laps of a finishing circuit . The circuit crossed the Côte Saint @-@ Roch again , then the Rue Bois des Moines , the Côte d <unk> and the Côte Petite Mormont , before finishing in Houffalize . The significant difference from previous year 's editions of the Eneco Tour was the absence of La Redoute from the finish . 
 The day 's early breakaway was formed by Jan Polanc ( Lampre – Merida ) , Matthias Brändle ( IAM Cycling ) , Nikias Arndt ( Giant – Alpecin ) , Sébastien Turgot ( AG2R La Mondiale ) and Jérôme Baugnies ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) . Though they had a four @-@ minute lead at one stage , they were caught as the race entered the finishing circuit . Andrey Amador ( Movistar Team ) was the first to attack from the peloton , with numerous other attacks following , and a new , eight @-@ man leading group was formed . This did not initially include Kelderman , the race leader , but he was able to rejoin the lead group as it grew to nineteen riders . Brändle attacked again and briefly led the race , but he was caught by work from Van Avermaet . Simon Geschke ( Giant – Alpecin ) attacked and was joined by Michael Rogers ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) . Wellens soon attacked from the group behind ; he caught and passed Geschke and Rogers on the Côte Saint @-@ Roch , then won nine seconds in the sprints in the golden kilometre . Van Avermaet attacked from the main group ; he too passed Geschke and Rogers to take second place in all three sprints and win six seconds . 
 Kelderman was once again dropped from the main group and was then again able to rejoin it , but the group was not able to chase Wellens down . Geschke and Van Avermaet rode together , while Jan Bakelants ( AG2R La Mondiale ) and Tom @-@ Jelte Slagter ( Cannondale – Garmin ) attacked from the main group . Wellens 's lead extended during the downhill run into Houffalize ; he won the stage by 49 seconds ahead of Van Avermaet , with Geschke third . Wellens moved into the overall lead , 1 ' 03 " ahead of Van Avermaet , with Kelderman dropping to third .

 16 August 2015 – Sint @-@ Pieters @-@ Leeuw to Geraardsbergen , 193 @.@ 8 km ( 120 @.@ 4 mi ) 
 The final stage of the race took place entirely in Belgium . It was a 193 @.@ 8 @-@ kilometre ( 120 @.@ 4 mi ) route that started in Sint @-@ Pieters @-@ Leeuw on the outskirts of Brussels and ended in Geraardsbergen in the area of East Flanders known as the Flemish Ardennes . The principal feature of stage 6 was the series of cobbled climbs . The stage began with a circuit in Sint @-@ Pieters @-@ Leeuw , then headed west . The first climb was the <unk> , but this was the only climb in the first 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) of racing . The final 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) included 16 climbs . The first of these , the Mont , came as the route turned north towards Oudenaarde and was followed by the <unk> and the <unk> . Here the riders turned to the east and crossed a series of climbs also used in the Tour of Flanders : the Leberg , the Berendries and the Valkenberg . The riders then crossed the <unk> before entering the two and a half laps of the finishing circuit . This included four climbs : the <unk> , the Muur van Geraardsbergen ( the final climb in the Tour of Flanders until 2012 ) , the <unk> and the <unk> . After two complete laps , the route finished halfway up the Muur van Geraardsbergen . 
 There was a fourteen @-@ rider breakaway that formed at the beginning of the day 's racing . This group never had a large advantage and broke up on the first ascent of the Muur . The lead group after the climb was formed of three men : Manuel Quinziato ( BMC Racing Team ) , Björn Leukemans ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) and Yves Lampaert ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) . Attacks came from the main group and eventually a ten @-@ man chasing group was formed . The leading three riders kept a lead of approximately a minute as riders came and went from the chasing group ; the chasers were caught by the main peloton ( led by Lotto – Soudal ) with approximately 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) to the finish line . 
 Quinziato , the weakest climber of the three leading riders , attacked at the summit of the <unk> , the penultimate climb of the day , quickly dropping Lampaert . Leukemans attempted to hold Quinziato 's wheel , but was dropped on the flat . Quinziato soon had half a minute 's lead and entered the base of the Muur alone . He had more difficulty on the climb , however : as Leukemans and Lampaert reached the cobbles , they quickly began to catch him . Quinziato eventually crossed the line with just a few seconds to spare . This was the second professional victory of his career , nine years after his first , which had come in the 2006 Eneco Tour . Wellens finished in a large group 42 seconds back and sealed his overall victory in the race . 
 = = Classification leadership table = = 
 There were four principal classifications in the race . The first of these was the general classification , calculated by adding up the time each rider took to ride each stage . Time bonuses were applied for winning stages ( 10 , 6 and 4 seconds to the first three riders ) and for the three " golden kilometre " sprints on each stage . At each of these sprints , the first three riders were given 3- , 2- and 1 @-@ second bonuses respectively . The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification . The rider leading the classification won a white jersey . 
 There was also a points classification . On each road stage the riders were awarded points for finishing in the top 10 places , with other points awarded for intermediate sprints . The rider with the most accumulated points was the leader of the classification and won the red jersey . The combativity classification was based solely on points won at the intermediate sprints ; the leading rider won the green jersey . The final stage was a team classification : on each stage the times of the best three riders on each team were added up . The team with the lowest cumulative time over the seven stages won the team classification . 
 = LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman = 
 LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman is a Pacific steam locomotive built in 1923 for the London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) at Doncaster Works to a design of Nigel Gresley . It was employed on long @-@ distance express East Coast Main Line trains by the LNER and its successors , British Railways Eastern and North @-@ Eastern Regions , notably on the London to Edinburgh Flying Scotsman train service after which it was named . 
 The locomotive set two world records for steam traction , becoming the first steam locomotive to be officially authenticated at reaching 100 miles per hour ( 160 @.@ 9 km / h ) on 30 November 1934 , and then setting a record for the longest non @-@ stop run by a steam locomotive when it ran 422 miles ( 679 km ) on 8 August 1989 while in Australia . 
 Retired from regular service in 1963 after covering 2 @.@ 08 million miles , Flying Scotsman gained considerable fame in preservation under the ownership of , successively , Alan Pegler , William McAlpine , Tony Marchington , and finally the National Railway Museum ( NRM ) . As well as hauling enthusiast specials in the United Kingdom , the locomotive toured extensively in the United States and Canada from 1969 until 1973 and Australia in 1988 / 89 . Flying Scotsman has been described as the world 's most famous steam locomotive . 
 = = History = = 
 The locomotive was completed in 1923 , construction having been started under the auspices of the Great Northern Railway ( GNR ) . It was built as an A1 , initially carrying the GNR number 1472 , because the LNER had not yet decided on a system @-@ wide numbering scheme . 
 Flying Scotsman was something of a flagship locomotive for the LNER . It represented the company at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924 and 1925 . Before this event , in February 1924 it acquired its name and the new number of 4472 . From then on it was commonly used for promotional purposes . 
 With suitably modified valve gear , this locomotive was one of five Gresley Pacifics selected to haul the prestigious non @-@ stop Flying Scotsman train service from London to Edinburgh , hauling the inaugural train on 1 May 1928 . For this the locomotives ran with a new version of the large eight @-@ wheel tender which held nine long tons of coal . This and the usual facility for water replenishment from the water trough system enabled them to travel the 392 miles ( 631 km ) from London to Edinburgh in eight hours non @-@ stop . 
 The tender included a corridor connection and tunnel through the water tank giving access to the locomotive cab from the train so that the driver and fireman could be changed without stopping the train . The following year the locomotive appeared in the film The Flying Scotsman . 
 While the Great Western Railway locomotive City of Truro had previously been unofficially timed at running in excess of 100 mph ( 160 @.@ 9 km / h ) , 4472 became the first steam locomotive to be officially authenticated at this speed on 30 November 1934 , driven by Bill <unk> and running a light test train . It earned a place in the land speed record for railed vehicles ; the publicity @-@ conscious LNER made much of the fact . 
 The locomotive ran with its corridor tender between April 1928 and October 1936 , after which it reverted to the original type ; in July 1938 it was paired with a streamlined non @-@ corridor tender , and ran with this type until withdrawal . On 22 August 1928 an improved version of this Pacific type , classified A3 , appeared ; older A1 locomotives were later rebuilt to conform . On 25 April 1945 , A1 @-@ class locomotives not yet rebuilt were reclassified A10 to make way for newer Thompson and Peppercorn Pacifics . Flying Scotsman emerged from Doncaster Works on 4 January 1947 as an A3 , having received a boiler with the long " banjo " dome of the type it carries today . By this time it had been renumbered twice : under Edward Thompson 's comprehensive renumbering scheme for the LNER , it became No. 502 in January 1946 ; in May the same year , under an amendment to that plan , it become No. 103 . Following nationalisation of the railways on 1 January 1948 , almost all of the LNER locomotive numbers were increased by <unk> ; No. 103 became 60103 in December 1948 . 
 Between 5 June 1950 and 4 July 1954 , and between 26 December 1954 and 1 September 1957 , under British Railways ownership , it was allocated to Leicester Central shed on the Great Central Railway , running Nottingham Victoria to London Marylebone services via Leicester Central . 
 All A3 Pacifics were subsequently fitted with a double Kylchap chimney to improve performance and economy . This caused soft exhaust and smoke drift that tended to obscure the driver 's forward vision ; the remedy was found in the German @-@ type smoke deflectors fitted from 1960 , which somewhat changed the locomotives ' appearance . 
 = = Preservation = = 
 In 1962 , British Railways announced that it would scrap Flying Scotsman . Number 60103 ended service with its last scheduled run on 14 January 1963 . Proposed to be saved by a group called " Save Our Scotsman " , they were unable to raise the required £ 3 @,@ 000 , the scrap value of the locomotive . 
 = = = Alan Pegler = = = 
 Alan Pegler , who first saw the locomotive at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924 , in 1961 received £ 70 @,@ 000 for his share holding when Northern Rubber was sold to Pegler 's Valves , a company started by his grandfather . When Flying Scotsman was due to be scrapped Pegler stepped in and bought it outright , with the political support of Prime Minister Harold Wilson . He spent large amounts of money over the next few years having the locomotive restored at Doncaster Works as closely as possible to its LNER condition : the smoke deflectors were removed ; the double chimney was replaced by a single chimney ; and the tender was replaced by one of the corridor type with which the locomotive had run between 1928 and 1936 . It was also repainted in LNER livery . Pegler then persuaded the British Railways Board to let him run enthusiasts ' specials ; it was at the time the only steam locomotive running on mainline British Railways . It worked a number of rail tours , including a non @-@ stop London to Edinburgh run in 1968 , the year steam traction officially ended on BR . In the meantime , watering facilities for steam locomotives were disappearing , so in September 1966 Pegler purchased a second corridor tender which was adapted as an auxiliary water tank ; retaining its through gangway , this was coupled behind the normal tender . 
 Pegler had a contract permitting him to run his locomotive on BR until 1972 . Following overhaul in the winter of 1968 – 69 Harold Wilson 's government agreed to support Pegler running the locomotive in the United States and Canada to support British exports . To comply with local railway regulations it was fitted with : a cowcatcher , bell , buckeye couplings , American @-@ style whistle , air brakes , and high @-@ intensity headlamp . Starting in Boston , Massachusetts , the tour ran into immediate problems , with some states increasing costs by requiring diesel @-@ headed @-@ haulage through them , seeing the locomotive as a fire hazard . However , the train ran from Boston to New York , Washington and Dallas in 1969 ; from Texas to Wisconsin and finishing in Montreal in 1970 ; and from Toronto to San Francisco in 1971 — a total of 15 @,@ 400 miles ( 24 @,@ 800 km ) . 
 Government financial support for the tour was withdrawn by Prime Minister Edward Heath 's Conservative government in 1970 , but Pegler decided to return for the 1970 season . By the end of that season 's tour , the money had run out and Pegler was £ 132 @,@ 000 in debt , with the locomotive in storage at the US Army Sharpe Depot to keep it away from unpaid creditors . Pegler worked his passage home from San Francisco to England on a P & O cruise ship in 1971 , giving lectures about trains and travel ; he was declared bankrupt in the High Court in 1972 . 
 = = = William McAlpine = = = 
 Fears then arose for the engine 's future , the speculation being that it might remain in the US or even be broken up . After Alan Bloom made a personal phone call to him in January 1973 , William McAlpine stepped in and bought the locomotive for £ 25 @,@ 000 direct from the finance company in San Francisco docks . After its return to the UK via the Panama Canal in February 1973 , McAlpine paid for the locomotive 's restoration at Derby Works . Trial runs took place on the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway in summer 1973 , after which it was transferred to Steamtown ( Carnforth ) , from where it steamed on various tours . In December 1977 ' Flying Scotsman ' entered the Vickers Engineering Works , Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness , for heavy repairs , including an unused replacement boiler . 
 In October 1988 Flying Scotsman arrived in Australia to take part in the country 's bicentenary celebrations as a central attraction in the Aus Steam ' 88 festival . The event organisers had been interested in having LNER A4 No 4468 Mallard visit , however due to the 50th anniversary of 4468 's world record high speed run it was unavailable and 4472 was recommended as its replacement . During the course of the next year Flying Scotsman travelled more than 45 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 28 @,@ 000 mi ) over Australian rails , concluding with a return transcontinental run from Sydney to Perth via Alice Springs in which it became the first steam locomotive to travel on the recently built standard gauge Central Australia Railway . Other highlights included Flying Scotsman double @-@ heading with New South Wales Government Railways Pacific locomotive <unk> , a triple @-@ parallel run alongside broad gauge Victorian Railways R class locomotives , and parallel runs alongside South Australian Railways locomotives 520 and 621 . Its visit to Perth saw a reunion with GWR 4073 Class Pendennis Castle , which had been exhibited alongside Flying Scotsman at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition . On 8 August 1989 Flying Scotsman set another record en route to Alice Springs from Melbourne , travelling 679 kilometres ( 422 mi ) from Parkes to Broken Hill non @-@ stop , the longest such run by a steam locomotive ever recorded . The same journey also saw Flying Scotsman set its own haulage record when it took a 735 @-@ ton train over the 490 @-@ mile ( 790 km ) leg between Tarcoola and Alice Springs . 
 Flying Scotsman returned to Britain in 1990 and continued working on the main line until its mainline certificate expired in 1993 . 4472 then toured preserved railways . To raise funds for its upcoming overhaul it was returned to BR condition with the refitting of the German style smoke deflectors and double chimney , and repainting in BR Brunswick green . By 1995 it was in pieces at Southall Railway Centre in West London , owned by a consortium that included McAlpine as well as music guru and railway enthusiast Pete Waterman . 
 = = = Tony Marchington = = = 
 Facing an uncertain future owing to the cost of restoration and refurbishment necessary to meet the stringent engineering standards required for main line operation , salvation came in 1996 when Dr Tony Marchington , already well known in the vintage movement , bought the locomotive , and had it restored over three years to running condition at a cost of £ 1 million , a restoration which , at the time , was recognised as the most extensive in the locomotive 's history . Marchington 's time with the Flying Scotsman was documented in a documentary , the Channel 4 programme A Steamy Affair : The Story of Flying Scotsman . 
 With Flying Scotsman 's regular use both on the <unk> Pullman and with other events on the main line , in 2002 , Marchington proposed a business plan , which included the construction of a " Flying Scotsman Village " in Edinburgh , to create revenue from associated branding . After floating on OFEX as Flying Scotsman plc in the same year , in 2003 Edinburgh City Council turned down the village plans , and in September 2003 Marchington was declared bankrupt . At the company 's AGM in October 2003 , CEO Peter Butler announced losses of £ 474 @,@ 619 , and with a £ 1 @.@ 5 million overdraft at Barclays Bank and stated that the company only had enough cash to trade until April 2004 . The company 's shares were suspended from OFEX on 3 November 2003 after it had failed to declare interim results .

 With the locomotive effectively placed up for sale , after a national campaign it was bought in April 2004 by the National Railway Museum in York , and it is now part of the museum 's National Collection .

 In January 2006 , Flying Scotsman entered the National Railway Museum 's workshops for a major overhaul to return it to Gresley 's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate ; originally planned to be completed by mid @-@ 2010 if sufficient funds were raised , but late discovery of additional problems meant it would not be completed on time . In October 2012 , the museum published a report examining the reasons for the delay and additional cost . The locomotive was moved in October 2013 to Bury for work to return it to running condition no earlier than summer 2015 . On 29 April 2015 , Flying Scotsman 's boiler left the National Railway Museum to be reunited with the rest of the locomotive at Riley & Son in Bury . 
 The bay in which the locomotive was being refurbished was on view to visitors to the NRM but the engine was rapidly dismantled to such an extent that the running plate was the only component recognisable to the casual observer . Early in 2009 it emerged that the overhaul would see the loco reunited with the last remaining genuine A3 boiler ( acquired at the same time as the locomotive as a spare ) . The A4 boiler that the loco had used since the early 1980s was sold to Jeremy Hosking for potential use on his locomotive , LNER Class A4 <unk> Bittern .

 The overhaul was completed in January 2016 and testing began on the East Lancashire Railway on 8 January 2016 .

The first mainline run , pulling the Winter Cumbrian Mountain Express from Carnforth to Carlisle , took place on 6 February . An inaugural journey from London King 's Cross to York in traditional green livery ran on 25 February . Flying Scotsman will be making special tours throughout the UK in 2016 .

 In 2011 , the National Railway Museum announced that Flying Scotsman will be painted in LNER war time black livery when it undergoes steam tests and commissioning runs , with the letters " N E " on the sides of its tender , number " 103 " on one side of the cab and " 502 " on the other – the numbers it was given under the LNER 's renumbering system . The locomotive remained in black for the NRM 's Flying Scotsman Preview event on 28 – 30 May 2011 . During the museum 's <unk> event on 2 – 10 June 2012 , Flying Scotsman was kept in front of Mallard in a siding in its black livery . A report on the restoration was published , in redacted form , on 7 March 2013 . On 23 January 2015 , the NRM announced that the smoke deflectors and double chimney will be retained , including a return to its BR green livery , to keep it as historically accurate as possible as No. 60103 .

 Because of the LNER 's emphasis on using the locomotive for publicity purposes , and then its eventful preservation history , including two international forays , it is one of the UK 's most recognised locomotives . One of its first film appearances was in the 1929 film The Flying Scotsman , which featured an entire sequence set aboard the locomotive . 
 In 1985 , Flying Scotsman appeared in a witty British Rail TV advert . 
 Flying Scotsman was featured in The Railway Series books by the Rev. W. Awdry . The locomotive visited the fictional Island of Sodor in the book Enterprising Engines to visit its only remaining brother : Gordon . At this time it had two tenders , and this was a key feature of the plot of one of the stories , " Tenders for Henry " . When the story was filmed for the television series Thomas & Friends , renamed as " Tender Engines " only Flying Scotsman 's two tenders and his cab roof were seen outside a shed . He originally was intended to have a larger role in this episode , but because of budgetary constraints , the modelling crew could not afford to build the entire engine . The engine makes a full appearance in Thomas & Friends : The Great Race , where he is voiced by Rufus Jones in all English @-@ speaking regions . 
 Flying Scotsman appeared in the 2000 film 102 Dalmatians preparing to haul the Orient Express . 
 The locomotive was the first choice for the Top Gear Race to the North , but due to an overhaul was unable to attend , so the position went to LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado instead . 
 A model of the Flying Scotsman appeared in Episode 6 and " The Great Train Race " episodes of James May 's Toy Stories . It was James May 's personal childhood model and was chosen by him to complete a world record for the longest model railway . The train was meant to travel 7 miles from Barnstaple to Bideford , in North Devon and it failed early in the trip in Episode 6 but managed to complete it in " The Great Train Race " which took place on 16 April 2011 . 
 One of the specially produced £ 5 coins for the 2012 Summer Olympics featured an engraving of the Flying Scotsman on the back . 
 Flying Scotsman is included as a locomotive in the PC simulation game Microsoft Train Simulator . 
 = History of public relations = 
 Most textbooks consider the establishment of the Publicity Bureau in 1900 to be the founding of the public relations ( PR ) profession . However , academics have found early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations , during the settling of the New World and during the movement to abolish slavery in England . Basil Clark is considered the founder of public relations in the United Kingdom for his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924 , though academic Noel Turnball believes PR was founded in Britain first by evangelicals and Victorian reformers . 
 Propaganda was used by the United States , the United Kingdom , Germany and others to rally for domestic support and demonize enemies during the World Wars , which led to more sophisticated commercial publicity efforts as public relations talent entered the private sector . Most historians believe public relations became established first in the US by Ivy Lee or Edward Bernays , then spread internationally . Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the Marshall plan . 
 The second half of the twentieth century is considered the professional development building era of public relations . Trade associations , PR news magazines , international PR agencies , and academic principles for the profession were established . In the early 2000s , press release services began offering social media press releases . The <unk> Manifesto , which predicted the impact of social media in 1999 , was controversial in its time , but by 2006 , the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted . 
 = = Ancient origins = = 
 Although the term " public relations " was not yet developed , academics like James E. <unk> and Scott Cutlip identified early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations . According to Edward Bernays , one of the pioneers of PR , " The three main elements of public relations are practically as old as society : informing people , persuading people , or integrating people with people . " Scott Cutlip said historic events have been defined as PR retrospectively , " a decision with which many may quarrel . " 
 A clay tablet found in ancient Iraq that promoted more advanced agricultural techniques is sometimes considered the first known example of public relations . Babylonian , Egyptian and Persian leaders created pyramids , obelisks and statues to promote their divine right to lead . Additionally , claims of magic or religious authority were used to persuade the public of a king or pharaoh 's right to rule . 
 Ancient Greek philosophers such as Isocrates , Plato and Aristotle created early theories in rhetoric and persuasion . In Greece there were advocates for hire called " sophists " . Plato and others said sophists were dishonest and misled the public , while the book " Public Relations as Communication Management " said they were " largely an ethical lot " that " used the principles of persuasive communication . " In Egypt court advisers consulted pharaohs to speak honestly and scribes documented a pharaoh 's deeds . In Rome Julius Caesar wrote the first campaign biography promoting his military successes . He also commissioned newsletters and poems to support his political position . In medieval Europe , craftsmen organized into guilds that managed their collective reputation . In England , Lord Chancellors acted as mediators between rulers and subjects . 
 Pope Urban II 's recruitment for the crusades is also sometimes referred to as a public relations effort . Pope Gregory XV founded the term " propaganda " when he created <unk> de Propaganda ( " congregation for propagating the faith " ) , which used trained missionaries to spread Christianity . The term did not carry negative connotations until it was associated with government publicity around World War II . In the early 1200s , the Magna Carta was created as a result of Stephen Langton lobbying English barons to insist King John recognize the authority of the church .

 Explorers like Magellan , Columbus and Raleigh used exaggerated claims of grandeur to entice settlers to come to the New World . For example , in 1598 , a desolate swampy area of Virginia was described by Captain Arthur Barlowe as follows : " The soil is the most plentiful , sweet , fruitful and wholesome of all the world . " When colonists wrote back to Europe about the hardships of colonizing Virginia , including the death toll caused by conflicts with Indians , pamphlets with anonymous authors were circulated to reassure potential settlers and rebuke criticisms . 
 The first newsletter and the first daily newspaper were founded in Germany in 1609 and 1615 respectively . Cardinal Richelieu of France had pamphlets made that supported his policies and attacked his political opposition . The government also created a publicity bureau called Information and Propaganda and a weekly newspaper originally controlled by the French government , The Gazette . In the mid @-@ 1600s both sides of the English Civil War conflict used pamphlets to attack or defend the monarchy respectively . Poet John Milton wrote anonymous pamphlets advocating for ideas such as liberalizing divorce , the establishment of a republic and the importance of free speech . A then @-@ anonymous pamphlet in 1738 by Maria Theresa of the Austrian Empire was influential in criticizing the freemasons and advocating for an alliance between the British , Dutch and Austrian governments . 
 In 1641 , Harvard University sent three preachers to England to raise money for missionary activities among the Indians . To support the fund @-@ raising , the University produced one of the earliest fund @-@ raising brochures , New England 's First Fruits . An early version of the press release was used when King 's College ( now Columbia University ) , sent out an announcement of its 1758 graduation ceremonies and several newspapers printed the information . Princeton was the first university to make it a routine practice of supplying newspapers with information about activities at the college . 
 According to Noel Turnball , a professor from RMIT University , more systematic forms of PR began as the public started organizing for social and political movements . The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was established in England in 1787 . It published books , posters and hosted public lectures in England advocating against slavery . Industries that relied on slavery attempted to persuade the middle @-@ class that it was necessary and that slaves had humane living conditions . The Slave Trade was abolished in 1807 . In the US , the movement to abolish slavery began in 1833 with the establishment of the American Anti @-@ Slavery Society , using tactics adopted from the British abolitionist movement . According to Edward Bernays , the US abolitionist movement used " every available device of communication , appeal and action , " such as petitions , pamphlets , political lobbying , local societies , and boycotts . The South responded by defending slavery on the basis of economics , religion and the constitution . In some cases propaganda promoting the abolition of slavery was forbidden in The South and abolitionists were killed or jailed . Public relations also played a role in abolitionist movements in France , Australia and in Europe . 
 The Boston Tea Party has been called a " public relations event " or pseudo event in that it was a staged event intended to influence the public . Pamphlets such as Common Sense ( 1775 – 76 ) and The American Crisis ( 1776 to 1783 ) were used to spread anti @-@ British propaganda in the United States , as well as the slogan " taxation without representation is tyranny . " After the revolution was won , disagreements broke out regarding the United States Constitution . Supporters of the constitution sent letters now called the Federalist Papers to major news outlets , which helped persuade the public to support the constitution . Exaggerated stories of Davy <unk> and the California Gold Rush were used to persuade the public to fight the war against Mexico and to migrate west in the U.S. respectively . 
 Author Marvin <unk> said public relations in the 1800s was spontaneous and de @-@ centralized . In the 1920s , Americans wanted to disprove the perspective of French aristocrats that the American democracy run by " the mob " had " no sense of history , no sense of gratitude to those who had served it , and no sense of the meaning of ' virtue ' " . To combat this perception , French aristocrat Marquis de Lafayette , who helped fund the American Revolution , was invited to a tour of the United States . Each community he visited created a committee to welcome him and promote his visit . In the mid @-@ 1800s P. T. Barnum founded the American Museum and the Barnum and Bailey Circus . He became well known for publicizing his circus using manipulative techniques . For example , he announced that his museum would exhibit a 161 @-@ year @-@ old woman , who had been Washington 's nurse , then produced an elderly woman and a forged birth certificate . 
 Early environmental campaigning groups like the Coal Abatement Society and the Congo Reform Association were formed in the late 1800s . In the late 1800s many of the now @-@ standard practices of media relations , such as conducting interviews and press conferences emerged . Industrial firms began to promote their public image . The German steel and armaments company Krupp created the first corporate press department in 1870 to write articles , brochures and other communications advertising the firm . The first US corporate PR department was established in 1889 by Westinghouse Corporation . " The first public relations department was created by the inventor and industrialist George Westinghouse in 1889 when he hired two men to publicize his pet project , alternating current ( AC ) electricity . " Some scholars believe that the first appearance of the term " public relations " was in the 1897 Year Book of Railway Literature . 
 = = Origins as a profession = = 
 The book Today 's Public Relations : An Introduction says that , although experts disagree on public relations ' origins , many identify the early 1900s as its beginning as a paid profession . According to Barbara Diggs @-@ Brown , an academic with the American University School of Communication , the PR field anchors its work in historical events in order to improve its perceived validity , but it didn 't begin as a professional field until around 1900 . Scott Cutlip said , " we somewhat arbitrarily place the beginnings of the public relations vocation with the establishment of The Publicity Bureau in Boston in mid @-@ 1900 . " He explains that the origins of PR cannot be pinpointed to an exact date , because it developed over time through a series of events . Most textbooks on public relations say that it was first developed in the United States , before expanding globally ; however , Jacquie L <unk> , an academic from the United Kingdom , said it was developed in the UK and the US simultaneously . Noel Turnball claims it began as a professional field in the 18th and 19th century with British evangelicals and Victorian reformers . According to academic <unk> Van Ruler , PR activities didn 't begin in Continental Europe as a professional field until the 1920s . 
 According to academic Stuart Ewen , most PR efforts in the US at the time were " damage control " . According to Goldman , from around 1903 to 1909 " many newspapers and virtually all mass @-@ circulation magazines featured detailed , indignant articles describing how some industry fleeced its stockholders , overcharged the public or corrupted politics . " The public became abruptly more critical of big business . The anti @-@ corporate and pro @-@ reform sentiment of the Progressive Era was reflected in newspapers , which were dramatically increasing in circulation as the cost of paper decreased . Public relations was founded , in part , to defend corporate interests against sensational and hyper @-@ critical news articles . It was also influential in promoting consumerism after the emergence of mass production .

 The Publicity Bureau was the first PR agency and was founded by former Boston journalists , including Ivy Lee . Ivy Lee is sometimes called the father of PR and was influential in establishing it as a professional practice . In 1906 , Lee published a Declaration of Principles , which said that PR work should be done in the open , should be accurate and cover topics of public interest . According to historian Eric Goldman , the declaration of principles marked the beginning of an emphasis on informing , rather than misleading , the public . Ivy Lee is also credited with developing the modern press release and the " two @-@ way @-@ street " philosophy of both listening to and communicating with the public . In 1906 , Lee helped facilitate the Pennsylvania Railroad 's first positive media coverage after inviting press to the scene of a railroad accident , despite objections from executives . At the time , secrecy about corporate operations was common practice . Lee 's work was often identified as spin or propaganda . In 1913 and 1914 , the mining union was blaming the Ludlow Massacre , where on @-@ strike miners and their families were killed by state militia , on the Rockefeller family and their coal mining operation , The Colorado Fuel and Iron Company . On the Rockefeller family 's behalf , Lee published bulletins called " Facts Concerning the Struggle in Colorado for Industrial Freedom , " which contained false and misleading information . Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it . It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness , go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families , inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories , attend social events , and especially to listen closely to the grievances . This was novel advice , and attracted widespread media attention , which opened the way to resolve the conflict , and present a more humanized versions of the Rockefellers . In response the labor press said Lee " twisted the facts " and called him a " paid liar , " a " hired <unk> , " and a " poisoner of public opinion . " By 1917 , Bethlehem Steel company announced it would start a publicity campaign against perceived errors about them . The Y.M.C.A. opened a new press secretary . AT & T and others also started their first publicity programs . 
 Edward Bernays , a nephew of Sigmund Freud , is also sometimes referred to as the father of PR and the profession 's first theorist for his work in the 1920s . He took the approach that audiences had to be carefully understood and persuaded to see things from the client 's perspective . He wrote the first textbook on PR and taught the first college course at New York University in 1923 . Bernays also first introduced the practice of using front groups in order to protect tobacco interests . In the 1930s he started the first vocational course in PR . Bernays was influenced by Freud 's theories about the subconscious . He authored several books , including <unk> Public Opinion ( 1923 ) , Propaganda ( 1928 ) , and The Engineering of Consent ( 1947 ) . He saw PR as an " applied social science " that uses insights from psychology , sociology , and other disciplines to scientifically manage and manipulate the thinking and behavior of an irrational and " <unk> " public . 
 In 1929 , Edward Bernays helped the Lucky Strike cigarette brand increase its sales among the female demographic . Research showed that women were reluctant to carry a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes , because the brand 's green color scheme clashed with popular fashion choices . Bernays persuaded fashion designers , charity events , interior designers and others to popularize the color green . He also positioned cigarettes as Torches of Freedom that represent rebellion against the norms of a male @-@ dominated society . 
 According to Ruth <unk> from Syracuse University , Lee and Bernays both had " initial and spectacular successes in raising PR from the art of the snake oil salesman to the calling for a true communicator . " However , " late in their careers , both Lee and Bernays took on clients with clearly reprehensible values , thus exposing themselves and their work to public criticism . " Walter Lippmann was also a contributor to early PR theory , for his work on the books Public Opinion ( 1922 ) and The Phantom Public ( 1925 ) . He coined the term " manufacture of consent , " which is based on the idea that the public 's consent must be coaxed by experts to support a democratic society . 
 Former journalist Basil Clarke is considered the founder of PR in the UK . He founded the UK 's first PR agency , Editorial Services , in 1924 . He also authored the world 's first code of ethics for the field in 1929 . Clarke wrote that PR , " must look true and it must look complete and candid or its ' credit ' is gone " . He suggested that the selection of which facts are disseminated by PR campaigns could be used to persuade the public . 
 Arthur W. Page is sometimes considered to be the father of " corporate public relations " for his work with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company ( AT & T ) from 1927 to 1946 . The company was experiencing resistance from the public to its monopolization efforts . In the early 1900s , AT & T had assessed that 90 percent of its press coverage was negative , which was reduced to 60 percent by changing its business practices and disseminating information to the press . According to business historian John Brooks , Page positioned the company as a public utility and increased the public 's appreciation for the its contributions to society . Stuart Ewen said AT & T used its advertising dollars with newspapers to manipulate its coverage and had their PR team write feature stories that were published as if they were written by independent journalists .

 Edward Clarke and Bessie Tyler were influential in growing the Ku Klux Clan to four million members over three years using publicity techniques in the early 1920s . In 1926 the Empire Marketing Board was formed by the British government in part to encourage a preference for goods produced in Britain . It folded in 1933 due to government cuts . In 1932 , a pamphlet " The Projection of England " advocated for the importance of England managing its reputation domestically and abroad . The Ministry of Information was established in the UK in 1937 . 
 Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were the first Presidents to emphasize the use of publicity . In the 1930s Roosevelt used the media to promote The New Deal and to blame corporations for the country 's economic problems . This led companies to recruit their own publicists to defend themselves . Roosevelt 's anti @-@ trust efforts led corporations to attempt to persuade the public and lawmakers " that bigger [ corporations ] was not necessarily more evil . " Wilson used the media to promote his government reform program , The New Freedom . He formed the Committee on Public Information . 
 In the 1930s , the National Association of Manufacturers was one of the first to create a major campaign promoting capitalism and pro @-@ business viewpoints . It lobbied against unions , The New Deal and the 8 @-@ hour work @-@ day . NAM tried mostly unsuccessfully to convince the public that the interests of the public were aligned with corporate interests and to create an association between commerce and democratic principles . During the Second World War , Coca Cola promised that " every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca @-@ Cola for five cents , wherever he is and whatever it costs the company . " The company persuaded politicians that it was crucial to the war @-@ effort and was exempted from sugar rationing . During the European Recovery Program PR became more established in Europe as US @-@ based companies with PR departments created European subsidiaries . 
 In 1938 , amid concerns regarding dropping diamond prices and sales volume , De Beers and its advertising agency N.W. Ayers adopted a strategy to " strengthen the association in the public 's mind of diamonds with romance , " whereas " the larger and finer the diamond , the greater the expression of love . " This became known as one of America 's " lexicon of great campaigns " for successfully persuading the public to purchase expensive luxury items during a time of financial stress through psychological manipulation . It also led to the development of the slogan " A diamond is forever " in 1947 and was influential in how diamonds were marketed thereafter . After World War I the first signs of public relations as a profession began in France and became more established through the Marshall Plan .

 The first organized , large @-@ scale propaganda campaigns were during World War I. Germany created the German Information Bureau to create pamphlets , books and other communications that were intended to support the justness of their cause , to encourage voluntary recruitment , to demonize the enemy and persuade America to remain neutral in the conflict . In response to learning about Germany 's propaganda , the British created a war propaganda agency called the Wellington House in September 1914 . Atrocity stories , both real and alleged , were used to incite hatred for the enemy , especially after the " Rape of Belgium " in 1915 . France created a propaganda agency in 1914 . Publicity in Australia led to a lift in the government 's ban on military drafts . Austria @-@ Hungary used propaganda tactics to attack the credibility of Italy 's leadership and its motives for war . Italy in @-@ turn created the Padua Commission in 1918 , which led Allied propaganda against Austria @-@ Hungary . 
 One week after the United States declared war on Germany in 1917 , US President Woodrow Wilson established the US propaganda agency , the Committee on Public Information ( Creel Commission ) , as an alternative to demands for media censorship by the US army and navy . The CPI spread positive messages to present an upbeat image about the war and denied fraudulent atrocities made up to incite anger for the enemy . The CPI recruited about 75 @,@ 000 " Four Minute Men , " volunteers who spoke about the war at social events for four minutes . 
 As a result of World War I propaganda , there was a shift in PR theory from a focus on factual argumentation to one of emotional appeals and the psychology of the crowd . The term " propaganda " which was originally associated with religion and the church , became a more widely known concept . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 Propaganda did not develop a negative connotation until it was used in Nazi propaganda for World War II . Even though Germany 's World War I propaganda was considered more advanced than that of other nations , Adolf Hitler said that propaganda had been under @-@ utilized and claimed that superior British propaganda was the main reason for losing the war . Nazi Germany created the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in March 1933 , just after Nazis took power . The Nazi party took editorial control over newspapers , created their own news organizations and established Nazi @-@ controlled news organizations in conquered regions . The Nazi party used posters , films , books and public speakers among other tactics . 
 According to historian <unk> Zeman , broadcasting became the most important medium for propaganda throughout the war . Posters were also used domestically and leaflets were dropped behind enemy lines by air @-@ ship . In regions conquered by Germany , citizens could be punished by death for listening to foreign broadcasts . Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries . US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war efforts and industrial production . Soviet posters also focused on industrial production . 
 In countries where citizens are subordinate to the government , aggressive propaganda campaigns continued during peace @-@ time , while liberal democratic nations primarily use propaganda techniques to support war efforts . 
 = = Professional development = = 
 According to historian Eric Goldman , by the 1940s public relations was being taught at universities and was a professional occupation relied on in a similar way as lawyers and doctors . However , it failed to obtain complete recognition as a profession due in part to a history of deceit . Author Marvin <unk> said in 1987 that the reputation of the profession was getting worse , while Robert L. Heath from the University of Houston said in 1991 that it was progressing toward " true professional status . " Academic J. A. R. Pimlott said it had achieved " quasi @-@ professionalism . " Heath said despite the field 's newfound professionalism and ethics , its reputation was still effected by a history of exploitive behavior . 
 The number of media outlets increased and PR talent from wartime propaganda entered the private sector . The practice of public relations became ubiquitous to reach political , activist and corporate objectives . The development of the press into a more real @-@ time media also led to heightened scrutiny of public relations activities and those they represent . For example , Richard Nixon was criticized for " <unk> " and " stonewalling " in his PR office 's responses to the Watergate scandal . 
 Trade associations were formed first in the U.S. in 1947 with the Public Relations Society of America ( PRSA ) , followed by the Institute of Public Relations ( now the Chartered Institute of Public Relations ) in London in 1948 . Similar trade associations were created in Australia , Europe , South Africa , Italy and Singapore . The International Association of Public Relations was founded in 1955 . The Institute for Public Relations held its first conference in 1949 and that same year the first British book on PR , " Public Relations and publicity " was published by J.H. Brebner . The International Association of Business Communicators was founded in 1970 . Betsy Ann Plank is called " the first lady of public relations " for becoming the first female president of the PRSA in 1973 . 
 Two of today 's largest PR firms , Edelman and Burson @-@ Marsteller , were founded in 1952 and 1953 respectively . Daniel Edelman created the first media tour in the 1950s by touring the country with " the Toni Twins , " where one had used a professional salon and the other had used Toni 's home @-@ care products . It was also during this period that trade magazines like PR Week , Ragans and <unk> were founded . John Hill , founder of Hill & Knowlton , is known as the first international PR pioneer . Hill & Knowlton was the first major U.S. firm to create a strong international network in the 1960s and 1970s . Both Edelman and Burson @-@ Marsteller followed Hill & Knowlton by establishing operations in London in the 1960s and all three began competing internationally in Asia , Europe and other regions . Jacques Coup de <unk> was influential in persuading U.S. and UK companies to also extend their PR efforts into the French market and for convincing French businesses to engage in PR activities . In the early 2000s , PR in Latin America began developing at a pace " on par with industrialized nations . " 
 According to The Global Public Relations Handbook , public relations evolved from a series of " press agents or publicists " to a manner of theory and practice in the 1980s . Research was published in academic journals like Public Relations Review and the Journal of Public Relations Research . This led to an industry consensus to categorize PR work into a four @-@ step process : research , planning , communication and action .

 During the 1990s specialties for communicating to certain audiences and within certain market segments emerged , such as investor relations or technology PR . New internet technology and social media websites effected PR strategies and tactics . In April 1999 , four managers from IBM , Sun Microsystems , National Public Radio and Linux Journal created " The <unk> Manifesto . " The Manifesto established 95 theses about the way social media and internet technologies were going to change business . It concluded that markets had become " smarter and faster than most companies , " because stakeholders were getting information from each other . The Manifesto " created a storm " with strong detractors and supporters . That same year , Seth Godin published a book on permission marketing , which advocated against advertising and in favor of marketing that is useful and educational . While initially controversial , by 2006 it became commonly accepted that social media had an important role in public relations . 
 Press releases , which were mostly unchanged for more than a century , began to integrate digital features . <unk> introduced the " Smart News Release , " which incorporated audio , video and images , in 1997 . This was followed by the <unk> multimedia release from <unk> in 2001 . The Social Media Release was created by Todd <unk> from Shift Communications in 2006 in response to a blog written by journalist and blogger Tom <unk> titled " Die ! Press release ! Die ! Die ! Die ! " Incorporating digital and social features became a norm among wire services , and companies started routinely making company announcements on their corporate blog . 
 According to The New York Times , corporate communications shifted from a monologue to two @-@ way conversational communications and new media also made it " easier for consumers to learn about the mix @-@ ups and blunders " of PR . For example , after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , BP tried to deflect blame to other parties , claim the spill was not as significant as it was and focused on the science , while human interest stories related to the damage were emerging . In 2011 , Facebook tried to covertly spread privacy concerns about competitor Google 's Social Circles . <unk> created a communications crisis after allegedly , repeatedly deleting negative comments on its Facebook page . During the Iraq War , it was exposed that the US created false radio personalities to spread pro @-@ American information and paid Iraqi newspapers to write articles written by American troops . 
 = Minority Report ( film ) = 
 Minority Report is a 2002 American science fiction action mystery @-@ thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and loosely based on the short story of the same name by Philip K. Dick . It is set primarily in Washington , D.C. , and Northern Virginia in the year 2054 , where " PreCrime " , a specialized police department , apprehends criminals based on foreknowledge provided by three psychics called " precogs " . The cast includes Tom Cruise as Chief of PreCrime John Anderton , Colin Farrell as Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer , Samantha Morton as the senior precog Agatha , and Max von Sydow as Anderton 's superior Lamar Burgess . The film combines elements of tech noir , whodunit , thriller and science fiction genres , as well as a traditional chase film , as the main protagonist is accused of a crime he has not committed and becomes a fugitive . 
 Spielberg has characterized the story as " fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot " . The film 's central theme is the question of free will versus determinism . It examines whether free will can exist if the future is set and known in advance . Other themes include the role of preventive government in protecting its citizenry , the role of media in a future state where technological advancements make its presence nearly boundless , the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor , and Spielberg 's repeated theme of broken families . 
 The film was first optioned in 1992 as a sequel to another Dick adaptation , Total Recall , and started its development in 1997 , after a script by Jon Cohen reached Spielberg and Cruise . Production suffered many delays due to Cruise 's Mission : Impossible II and Spielberg 's A.I. running over schedule , eventually starting in March 2001 . During pre @-@ production , Spielberg consulted numerous scientists in an attempt to present a more plausible future world than that seen in other science fiction films , and some of the technology designs in the film have proven prescient . Minority Report has a unique visual style . It uses high contrast to create dark colors and shadows , much like a film noir picture . The film 's overlit shots feature desaturated colors which were achieved by bleach @-@ bypassing the film 's negative in post @-@ production . 
 Minority Report was one of the best reviewed films of 2002 . It received praise for its writing , visuals and themes , but earned some criticism for its ending which was considered inconsistent with the tone of the rest of the movie . The film was nominated for and won several awards . It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Editing , and eleven Saturn Award nominations , including Best Actor , Best Supporting Actor , and Saturn Award for Best Music , winning Best Science Fiction Film , Best Direction , Best Writing , and Best Supporting Actress . The film was a commercial success , earning over $ 358 million worldwide against an overall budget of $ 142 million ( including advertising ) . Over four million DVDs were sold in its first few months of home release . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In April 2054 , Washington , D.C. ' s PreCrime police stops murderers before they act , reducing the murder rate to zero . Murders are predicted using three mutated humans , called " Precogs " , who " previsualize " crimes by receiving visions of the future . Would @-@ be murderers are imprisoned in their own happy virtual reality . The Federal government is on the verge of adopting the controversial program . 
 Since the disappearance of his son Sean , PreCrime Captain John Anderton has separated from his wife Lara and becomes a drug addict . While United States Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer is auditing the program , the Precogs generate a new prediction , saying Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours . Anderton does not know Crow , but flees the area as Witwer begins a manhunt . Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman , the creator of PreCrime technology . She reveals that sometimes , one of the Precogs , usually Agatha , has a different vision than the other two , a " minority report " of a possible alternate future ; this has been kept a secret as it would damage the system 's credibility . Anderton resolves to recover the minority report to prove his innocence . 
 Anderton goes to a black market doctor for a risky eye transplant so as to avoid the city @-@ wide optical recognition system . He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha , shutting down the system , as the Precogs operate as a group mind . Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow , but none exists ; instead , Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively , a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049 . 
 Anderton and Agatha go to Crow 's apartment as the 36 @-@ hour time nears , finding numerous photos of children , including Sean 's . Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him , accusing him to be a serial child killer . Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him that he has the ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it . Crow however begs to be killed , having been hired to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family 's financial well being . Crow grabs Anderton 's gun and pushes the trigger , killing himself . Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara 's house outside the city for refuge . There they learn Lively was Agatha 's drug @-@ addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime . Lively had sobered up and attempted to reclaim Agatha , but was murdered . Anderton realizes he is being targeted for knowing about Lively 's existence and her connection to Agatha . 
 Witwer , studying Crow 's death , suspects Anderton is being framed . He examines the footage of Lively 's murder and finds there were two attempts on her life , the first having been stopped by PreCrime but the second , occurring minutes later , having succeeded . Witwer reports this to the director and founder of PreCrime , Lamar Burgess , but Burgess responds by killing Witwer using Anderton 's gun . With the Precogs still offline , the murder is not detected . 
 Lara calls Burgess to reveal that Anderton is with her , and Anderton is captured , accused of both murders , and fitted with the brain device that puts him permanently into a dreamlike sleep . As his body is deposited into the prison , the warden tells him , " that all your dreams come true . ” 
 Agatha is reconnected to the PreCrime system . While attempting to comfort Lara , Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively 's murderer . Lara frees Anderton from stasis , and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha 's vision of Burgess killing Lively . A new report is generated at PreCrime : Burgess will kill Anderton . Burgess corners Anderton , and explains that as he could not afford to let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime , he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life , so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored . Anderton points out Burgess 's dilemma : If Burgess kills Anderton , he will be imprisoned for life , but PreCrime will be validated ; if he spares Anderton , PreCrime will be discredited and shut down . Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system : once people are aware of their future , they are able to change it . Burgess shoots himself . 
 After Burgess 's death , the PreCrime system is shut down and all prisoners pardoned . Anderton and Lara are soon to have a new child together . The Precogs are sent to an isolated island to live their lives in peace .

 Dick 's story was first optioned by producer and writer Gary Goldman in 1992 . He created the initial script for the film with Ron Shusett and Robert Goethals ( uncredited ) . It was supposed to be a sequel to the 1990 Dick adaptation Total Recall , which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger . Novelist Jon Cohen was hired in 1997 to adapt the story for a potential film version that would have been directed by Dutch filmmaker Jan de Bont . Meanwhile , Cruise and Spielberg , who met and became friends on the set of Cruise 's film Risky Business in 1983 , had been looking to collaborate for ten years . Spielberg was set to direct Cruise in Rain Man , but left to make Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade . Cruise read Cohen 's script , and passed it onto Spielberg , who felt it needed some work . Spielberg was not directly involved in the writing of the script ; however , he was allowed to decide whether the picture 's screenplay was ready to be filmed . When Cohen submitted an acceptable revision , he called Cruise and said , " Yeah , I 'll do this version of the script . " In that version , Witwer creates a false disk which shows Anderton killing him . When Anderton sees the clip , his belief in the infallibility of the precogs ' visions convinces him it is true , therefore the precogs have a vision of him killing Witwer . At the end , Anderton shoots Witwer and one of the brother precogs finishes him off , because Witwer had slain his twin . Spielberg was attracted to the story because as both a mystery and a movie set 50 years in the future , it allowed him to do " a blending of genres " which intrigued him . 
 In 1998 , the pair joined Minority Report and announced the production as a joint venture of Spielberg 's DreamWorks and Amblin Entertainment , 20th Century Fox , Cruise 's Cruise / Wagner Productions , and De Bont 's production company , Blue Tulip . Spielberg however stated that despite being credited , De Bont never became involved with the film . Cruise and Spielberg , at the latter 's insistence , reportedly agreed to each take 15 % of the gross instead of any money up front to try to keep the film 's budget under $ 100 million . Spielberg said he had done the same with name actors in the past to great success : " Tom Hanks took no cash for Saving Private Ryan but he made a lot of money on his profit participation . " He made this agreement a prerequisite : 
 I haven 't worked with many movie stars — 80 per cent of my films don 't have movie stars — and I 've told them if they want to work with me I want them to gamble along with me . I haven 't taken a salary in 18 years for a movie , so if my film makes no money I get no money . They should be prepared to do the same . 
 Production was delayed for several years ; the original plan was to begin filming after Cruise 's Mission : Impossible II was finished . However , that film ran over schedule , which also allowed Spielberg time to bring in screenwriter Scott Frank to rework Cohen 's screenplay . John August did an uncredited draft to polish the script , and Frank Darabont was also invited to rewrite , but was by then busy with The Majestic . The film closely follows Frank 's final script ( written May 16 , 2001 ) , and contains much of Cohen 's third draft ( May 24 , 1997 ) . Frank removed the character of Senator Malcolm from Cohen 's screenplay , and inserted Burgess , who became the " bad guy " . He also rewrote Witwer from a villain to a " good guy " , as he was in the short story . In contrast to Spielberg 's next science fiction picture , War of the Worlds , which he called " 100 percent character " driven , Spielberg said the story for Minority Report became " fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot . " According to film scholar Warren Buckland , " It appears that ... Cohen and ... Frank did not see " the " Goldman and <unk> screenplay ; instead ; they worked on their own adaptation . " Goldman and <unk> however claimed the pair used a lot of material from their script , so the issue went through the Writer 's Guild arbitration process . They won a partial victory ; they were not given writing credits , but were listed as executive producers . The film was delayed again so Spielberg could finish A.I. after the death of his friend Stanley Kubrick . When Spielberg originally signed on to direct , he planned to have an entirely different supporting cast . He offered the role of Witwer to Matt Damon , Iris Hineman to Meryl Streep , Burgess to Ian McKellen , Agatha to Cate Blanchett , and Lara to Jenna Elfman . However , Streep declined the role , Damon opted out , and the other roles were recast due to the delays . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 After E.T. , Spielberg started to consult experts , and put more scientific research into his science fiction films . In 1999 , he invited fifteen experts convened by the Global Business Network , its chairman , Peter Schwartz , and its co @-@ founder Stewart Brand to a hotel in Santa Monica , California for a three @-@ day " think tank " . One of them was urbanist , futurist , and journalist Joel Garreau . He wanted to consult with the group to create a plausible " future reality " for the year 2054 as opposed to a more traditional " science fiction " setting . Dubbed the " think tank summit " , the experts included architect Peter Calthorpe , Douglas Coupland , computer scientist Neil <unk> , biomedical researcher Shaun Jones , computer scientist Jaron Lanier , and former Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) architecture dean William J. Mitchell . Production designer Alex McDowell kept what was nicknamed the " 2054 bible " , an 80 @-@ page guide created in preproduction which listed all the decided upon aspects of the future world : architectural , socio @-@ economical , political , and technological . While the discussions did not change key elements in the film 's action sequences , they were influential in the creation of some of the more utopian aspects of the film , though John <unk> , the science and technology advisor for the film , described it as " much grayer and more ambiguous " than what was envisioned in 1999 . John <unk> , who designed most of Anderton 's interface after Spielberg told him to make it " like conducting an orchestra " , said " it would be hard to identify anything [ in the movie ] that had no grounding in reality . " McDowell teamed up with architect Greg Lynn to work on some of the technical aspects of the production design . Lynn praised his work , saying that " [ a ] lot of those things Alex cooked up for Minority Report , like the 3 @-@ D screens , have become real . " Spielberg described his ideas for the film 's technology to Roger Ebert before the movie 's release : 
 I wanted all the toys to come true someday . I want there to be a transportation system that doesn 't emit toxins into the atmosphere . And the newspaper that updates itself ... 
 The Internet is watching us now . If they want to . They can see what sites you visit . In the future , television will be watching us , and customizing itself to what it knows about us . The thrilling thing is , that will make us feel we 're part of the medium . The scary thing is , we 'll lose our right to privacy . An ad will appear in the air around us , talking directly to us . 
 News sources have noted the future technologies depicted in the film were prescient . The Guardian published a piece titled " Why Minority Report was spot on " in June 2010 , and the following month Fast Company examined seven crime fighting technologies in the film similar to ones then appearing . It summarized that " the police state imagined in the Tom Cruise flick feels a bit more real every day . " Other major media outlets such as The Wall Street Journal have published articles dedicated to this phenomenon , and National Public Radio ( NPR ) published an August 2010 podcast which analyzed the film 's accuracy in predicting future technologies . Companies like Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have announced they were motivated to do research by the film ; in HP 's case to develop cloud computing .

A company representative , at the 2007 premiere of the Apple iPhone , promised it " will feel like Minority Report . " When Microsoft released the Kinect motion sensing camera add @-@ on for their Xbox 360 gaming console in 2010 , the Kinect 's technology allowed several programmers , including students at MIT , to create Minority Report @-@ inspired user interfaces . 
 Retina scanners , by a Manhattan company named Global <unk> Incorporated ( GRI ) ( 2010 ) . GRI disputed the notion that its technology could be the threat to privacy it is in the film . " Minority Report is one possible outcome , " a corporate official told Fast Company . " I don 't think that 's our company 's aim , but I think what we 're going to see is an environment well beyond what you see in that movie — minus the precogs , of course . " The company is installing hundreds of the scanners in Bank of America locations in Charlotte , North Carolina , and has a contract to install them on several United States Air Force bases .

" 
 Facial recognition advertising billboards , being developed by the Japanese company NEC . These billboards will theoretically be able to recognize passers @-@ by via facial recognition , call them by name , and deliver customer specific advertisements . Thus far the billboards can recognize age and gender , and deliver demographically appropriate adverts , but cannot discern individuals . According to The Daily Telegraph , the billboards will " behave like those in ... Minority Report ... in which Cruise 's character is confronted with digital signs that call out his name as he walks through a futuristic shopping mall . " IBM is developing similar billboards which plan to deliver customized adverts to individuals who carry identity tags . Like NEC , the company feels they will not be obtrusive as their billboards will only advertise products which a customer is interested in . Advertisers are embracing these billboards as they figure to reduce costs by lowering the number of adverts wasted on uninterested consumers . 
 Crime prediction software , developed by a professor from the University of Pennsylvania ( 2010 ) . The software , which was detailed in a Daily Mail article titled " The real Minority Report " upon its announcement , " collates a range of variables then uses an algorithm to work out who is at the highest chance of offending . " As in the film , the program was announced for a trial run in Washington D.C. , which , if successful , will lead to a national rollout . 
 Electronic paper , development announced by Xerox ( 2002 ) , MIT ( 2005 ) , Germany ( 2006 ) , media conglomerate Hearst Corporation ( 2008 ) , and LG ; a South Korean electronics manufacturer ( 2010 ) . Xerox has been trying to develop something similar to e @-@ paper since before the film was released in theaters . In 2005 , when The Washington Post asked the chief executive of MIT 's spin @-@ off handling their research when " the Minority Report newspaper " would be released , he predicted " around 2015 " . In 2006 PC World announced in an article titled : " German Researchers Say ' Minority Report ' Transparent Screens Possible " , German researchers thought they would be available in two years . Tech Watch 's 2008 article , " ' Minority Report ' e @-@ newspaper on the way " , noted that Hearst was " pushing large amounts of cash into " the technology .

 = = = Filming = = = 
 Minority Report was the first film to have an entirely digital production design . Termed " <unk> " , as an abbreviation of previsualization ( a term borrowed from the film 's narrative ) , production designer Alex McDowell said the system allowed them to use Photoshop in place of painters , and employ 3 @-@ D animation programs ( Maya and XSI ) to create a simulated set , which could be filled with digital actors then used to block out shots in advance . The technology also allowed the tie @-@ in video game and special effects companies to cull data from the <unk> system before the film was finished , which they used to establish parameters for their visuals . When Spielberg quickly became a fan , McDowell said " [ i ] t became pretty clear that [ he ] wouldn 't read an illustration as a finished piece , but if you did it in Photoshop and created a photorealistic environment he focused differently on it . " Filming took place from March 22 to July 18 , 2001 , in Washington , D.C. , Virginia , and Los Angeles . Film locations included the Ronald Reagan Building ( as PreCrime headquarters ) and Georgetown . The skyline of Rosslyn , Virginia is visible when Anderton flies across the Potomac River . During production , Spielberg made regular appearances on a video @-@ only webcam based in the craft services truck , both alone and with Tom Cruise ; together they <unk> publicly with Ron Howard and Russell Crowe via a similar webcam on the set of " A Beautiful Mind " in New York . 
 The location of the small , uncharted island in the last shot of the film is Butter island off North Haven , Maine in the Penobscot Bay . 
 Although it takes place in an imagined future world of advanced technology , Minority Report attempts to embody a more " realistic " depiction of the future . Spielberg decided that to be more credible , the setting had to keep both elements of the present and ones which specialists expected would be forthcoming . Thus Washington , D.C. as depicted in the movie keeps well @-@ known buildings such as the Capitol and the Washington Monument , as well as a section of modern buildings on the other side of the Potomac River . Production designer Alex McDowell was hired based on his work in Fight Club and his storyboards for a film version of Fahrenheit 451 which would have starred Mel Gibson . McDowell studied modern architecture , and his sets contain many curves , circular shapes , and reflective materials . Costume designer Deborah L. Scott decided to make the clothes worn by the characters as simple as possible , so as not to make the depiction of the future seem dated . 
 The stunt crew was the same one used in Cruise 's Mission : Impossible II , and was responsible for complex action scenes . These included the auto factory chase scene , filmed in a real facility using props such as a welding robot , and the fight between Anderton and the jetpack @-@ clad officers , filmed in an alley set built on the Warner Bros. studio lot . Industrial Light & Magic did most of the special effects , and DreamWorks @-@ owned PDI was responsible for the Spyder robots . The company Pixel Liberation Front did previsualization animatics . The holographic projections and the prison facility were filmed by several roving cameras which surrounded the actors , and the scene where Anderton gets off his car and runs along the Maglev vehicles was filmed on stationary props , which were later replaced by computer @-@ generated vehicles . 
 = = = Storyline differences = = = 
 The Philip K. Dick story only gives you a springboard that really doesn 't have a second or third act . Most of the movie is not in the Philip K. Dick story – to the chagrin of the Philip K. Dick fans , I 'm sure . 
 Like most film adaptations of Dick 's works , many aspects of his story were changed in their transition to film , such as the addition of Lamar Burgess and the change in setting from New York City to Washington , D.C. , Baltimore , and Northern Virginia . The character of John Anderton was changed from a balding and out @-@ of @-@ shape old man to an athletic officer in his 40s to fit its portrayer and the film 's action scenes . The film adds two stories of tragic families ; Anderton 's , and that of the three pre @-@ cogs . In the short story , Anderton is married with no children , while in the film , he is the divorced father of a kidnapped son , who is most likely deceased . Although it is implied , but unclear in the film whether Agatha is related to the twin pre @-@ cogs , her family was shattered when Burgess murdered her mother , Anne Lively . The precogs were intellectually disabled and deformed individuals in the story , but in the film , they are the genetically mutated offspring of drug addicts . Anderton 's future murder and the reasons for the conspiracy were changed from a general who wants to discredit PreCrime to regain some military funding , to a man who murdered a precog 's mother to preserve PreCrime . The subsequent murders and plot developed from this change . The film 's ending also differs from the short story 's . In Dick 's story , Anderton prevents the closure of the PreCrime division , however , in the movie Anderton successfully brings about the end of the organization . Other aspects were updated to include current technology . For instance in the story , Anderton uses a punch card machine to interpret the precogs ' visions ; in the movie , he uses a virtual reality interface . 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 = = = = Free will versus determinism = = = = 
 The main theme of Minority Report is the classic philosophical debate of free will versus determinism . One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future . As critic C.A. Wolski commented , " At the outset , Minority Report ... promises to mine some deep subject matter , to do with : do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate ? " However , there is also the added question of whether the precogs ' visions are correct . As reviewer James Berardinelli asked , " is the Precogs ' vision accurate , or has it in some way been tampered with ? Perhaps Anderton isn 't actually going to kill , but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way . " The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future , he can change it . However , the film also indicates that Anderton 's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow 's death . Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film , " [ h ] ere 's the biggest one of all : Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying . In Anderton 's situation , he runs because he is accused . The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man . Take away the accusation , and there would be no question of him committing a criminal act . The prediction drives the act – a self @-@ fulfilling prophecy . You can see the vicious circle , and it 's delicious ( if a little maddening ) to ponder . " Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists , as the perpetrators control their actions , and the precogs ' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices . 
 The central theme of the movie is discussed in the film 's fourth scene . Witwer discusses the PreCrime system with the division 's staff . He believes that its main " legalistic drawback " is that it " arrests individuals who have broken no laws . " Jad responds , " But they will ! " When Anderton later arrives upon this discussion , he acknowledges the paradox Witwer raises ; that the precogs prevent an event accepted as fact , but one which will never happen . To show him that people regularly use predetermination , Anderton picks up a wooden ball and rolls it toward Witwer , who catches it before it lands on the ground . When asked why he caught the ball , Witwer says " Because it was going to fall . " Anderton replies , " But it didn 't . " Then confidently tells him , " The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn 't change the fact that it was going to happen . " Kowalski feels this example is faulty in the sense that the ball has no free will ; it merely acts according to the laws of physics , but he acknowledges that if an individual were to have freely chosen to commit murder , then it would hold . Film scholar Stephen Mulhall points out that unlike the laws of physics which have a series of scientifically testable causal laws , Anderton merely has the visions of the precogs , whose psychic abilities are not fully explained by science . 
 Another quandary is that if the precogs ' visions are infallible then the future cannot be otherwise , while if they are incorrect people will be punished for crimes they will never commit . Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the " conditional future " . He cites as evidence two examples : the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them , and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex @-@ wife what would have happened to their child if he had lived . In the first example , Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him , and , in the second , she knows what will have happened to the Andertons ' son based on specific scenarios throughout his life , in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to do , and what selections various people in his life would have freely made . According to Kowalski , the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer . Philosophy professor Michael Huemer adds that he believes " the only way the otherwise predetermined future seen by the precogs can be averted , we are led to believe , is by the influence of the precogs themselves , " and that since there was no minority report ( i.e. ; no possibility of an alternative fate ) for Anderton , the only way he can change the future is by knowing the precogs ' visions . 
 = = = = Political and legal = = = = 
 Spielberg said that the arrest of criminals before they have a chance to commit their crimes in the movie had some real world background in post 9 / 11 America , commenting that " [ w ] e ’ re giving up some of our freedom so that the government can protect us . " The future world in Minority Report of retinal scans , robotic human inspectors , and intrusive , individualized , public advertising arrived in American theaters as the country was debating how much governmental intrusion into personal matters was necessary to ensure safety of its citizens . Spielberg said he would be against a PreCrime system if it were ever possible , as he believes that if it did exist , those in control of it would undoubtedly abuse its powers . Kowalski questions what the benevolent precogs in the film could become in the hands of those who trained their skills for political intrigue . Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl asserts that in a political context , PreCrime may be seen " a metaphor for racial profiling , and one could view the liberation of the precogs as the end of a form of slavery . " 
 Kowalski feels the isolation of the precogs ensures that they see their visions merely as facts , and removes them from having to justify them . The precogs ' ignorance of the results of their visions prevents them from knowing the effectiveness of the program . He feels the PreCrime officers are thus more qualified to evaluate their efficacy " than the precogs themselves . " In the December 2003 edition of the academic journal Film Criticism , scholar Mark Garrett Cooper moved past that point by asserting that not only have the precogs " yet to fully understand " their visions , but that the process by which the images are interpreted makes it so that no one individual could understand them without the use of the apparatus . The machinery is so effective and precise according to Cooper however , that the " omnipresent system effectively makes capture more certain than the crime . " When the system targets the hero [ Cruise ] , instead of fleeing , he remains in the vicinity in the belief that the system will , in its inexorable logic , correct itself . The apparatus is considered so infallible according to Cooper that the hero knows once he is cleared by it , his life can immediately return to normal . In this respect , Cooper feels that " far from indicting a security state , the film legitimates one " . 
 The film presents a legal system where the PreCrime office gathers the images from the minds of the precogs , then organizes them into a coherent order for display in front of a set of judges . The judges appear via video feeds , analyze the images , and according to Cooper they view the images , listen to Anderton rattle off " a string of legalistic verbiage " , then give it a " pro forma ratification . " Thus the accused is never present , is not allowed a defense , and is convicted before he is aware he is on trial . The program is marketed in a similar basic fashion , as in its tag line : " It works . " Cooper says that in a typical American courtroom drama , the audience is treated as if it were the jury , but in this system , instead of desiring the hero be proven innocent , the audience seeks to have the guilt transferred from Anderton to Burgess . But to do so Anderton has to disprove the system , which he does by proving the existence of the minority report . This renders the PreCrime justice system inoperable , as if there is doubt related not merely to the gathering of the images , or their ability to be interpreted , but their ability to be correct even in perfect circumstances , then the system of infallible guilt can not exist . 
 = = = = Media = = = = 
 Spielberg conceived of the idea of a future world permeated with intrusive capitalism and government surveillance after everyone at the " think tank summit " told him that " the right of privacy is a diminishing commodity " which will soon be thrown " right out the window " . According to film critic J. Hoberman , Minority Report " visualizes ( as well as demonstrates ) a future where the unconscious has been thoroughly colonized . " When the movie first appeared in theaters a common source of reviewers ' complaints was the film 's product placement , which they found intrusive . The personalized advertising is disconcerting partly because of the invasion of privacy , but also , argues Cooper , because it is cold , <unk> , and insincere . Film scholar Martin Hall says that the purpose of the ads Anderton runs into are " encouraging him to buy certain products and , by extension , affirm his place in society . " 
 Cooper feels Minority Report emphasizes the future importance of the control over imagery . According to him , the images captured from the precogs ' visions in the film bestow power on those who control their processing . He says the film warns viewers that those who control images must be carefully overseen so as to prevent the abuse of power , and that the film presents " governance as a problem of image arrangement " . Cooper says the quandary arises when the film intimates that there will be no way to escape the media industry 's omnipotence in the future , while at the same time defending " the need for image manipulating institutions " . He feels that this logically raises another issue in that the same concern could be leveled towards image @-@ makers such as DreamWorks , and he says the " film 's virtue lies in provoking this question " . He notes that the film 's tranquil ending concludes with the Andertons looking out into a peaceful exterior with only rain visible , and the precogs reading in their isolated , idyllic farm , and both families apparently free of electronic surveillance . 
 = = = = Self @-@ perception = = = = 
 In his analysis of the movie in the academic journal Rhizomes , scholar Martin Hall discusses the self @-@ perception people develop based on the views of those outside of themselves . The academic notes that when a child first comprehends the function of a mirror , they begin to develop the understanding that their perception of themselves is not self @-@ contained , and learn that they are what they see in the mirror . He contrasts this to when Anderton discovers the precogs ' vision of his future self . Anderton becomes flustered while interpreting the images which show him about to commit murder . According to Hall , he begins " searching for whatever possible versions of this representation are available to him , other than the one that represents him as a murderer . " He literally becomes obsessed with himself , seeking to resolve these images which put him at " discordance with his own reality " . Hall says that he is sorting through the images so feverishly because he is convinced once they are sorted properly and understood , they will not show him to be the murderer , as he is convinced that he is not one . Previously , at peace with himself , Hall says Anderton cannot accept the image he sees in the precogs ' visions . Unable to reconcile the two , Hall says he is forced to decide that " it is likely that errors have occurred " in the PreCrime system . Agatha enters a similar period of self @-@ examination when she has visions of her mother 's death , and is informed they are merely " echoes " , i.e. a faulty image in her memory . 
 When he escapes the building and enters the mall , Hall feels he is disturbed by ads calling to him by name not only because they will give away his presence , but also because they remind him of his lost place in society , and he begins " to see through the false consciousness his ( illusory ) previous position as fixed subject had allowed him . " Spielberg said Anderton is being punished for his previous callous unconcern for anything but the effectiveness of the PreCrime program . " He 's dirtied by the fact that he doesn 't spend much time thinking about the moral consequences . It 's just like a sporting event almost — and then suddenly that whole sporting event makes him the soccer ball . " Hall says that his doubts about his own future lead him to examine his previous life to better understand himself . He runs through his role in the PreCrime system , and his son 's disappearance " to reconstruct his past " . After Leo Crow in fact kills himself , Anderton becomes healed , and later has " recreated himself as the subject he was previously through the knowledge that he is not a killer . " Although he has satisfactorily repaired his self @-@ image , Hall notes that Anderton is not the same person , as he no longer believes in the PreCrime system . Hall says that Burgess 's final quandary ; namely his desire to keep PreCrime running , but his inability to bring himself to kill Anderton to accomplish that task , and his desire to live , drives him to see his only suitable action to be suicide . 
 = = = = Broken family = = = = 
 Minority Report continues Spielberg 's tradition of depicting broken families , which he has said is motivated by his parents ' divorce when he was a child . In Dick 's short story , Anderton is a childless , married man whose main motives are self @-@ preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division . While he is also trying to save himself in the movie , his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son 's disappearance . Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film , War of the Worlds , from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children . Buckland notes that the two tragic parent @-@ child relationships in the picture ( Agatha and Anne Lively , John and Sean Anderton ) have a common element . The movie has four shots of them submerged in water . Agatha 's face is shown in a close up shot , taken from directly above her , when she is submerged in her photon milk , nutrient bath . When photos of her mother 's submerged corpse are shown to her , the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above . Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest . John is underwater when his son is taken , and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless , immersed in a filled bathtub , in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Anne . Buckland notes that co @-@ screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme , as he wrote Agatha and her mother 's back stories while adding the bathtub scene . 
 = = Music = = 
 The score was composed and conducted by John Williams and orchestrated by John Neufeld , with vocals by Deborah Dietrich . Williams normally enters Spielberg productions at an early stage , well before the movie starts shooting . For Minority Report however , his entry was delayed due to his work on Star Wars : Episode II – Attack of the Clones , and he joined the film when it was nearly completed , leaving him scant production time . The soundtrack takes inspiration from Bernard Herrmann 's work . Williams decided not to focus on the science fiction elements , and made a score suitable for film noir . He included traditional noir elements such as a female singer in the Anne Lively scenes , but the " sentimental scenes " , which Williams considered unusual for that genre , led to soothing themes for Anderton 's ex @-@ wife Lara and son Sean . The track " Sean 's Theme " is described as the only one " instantly recognizable as one of Williams ' " by music critic Andrew Granade . Spielberg typified it as " a black and white score " and said , " I think Johnny Williams does a really nice bit of homage to Benny Herrmann . " 
 In an interview which appeared in The New York Times , Williams said that the choices for many of the pieces of classical music were made by the studio . He also said that while he did not know why certain pieces were chosen , Franz Schubert 's Symphony No. 8 ( commonly known as the Unfinished Symphony ) , which features prominently in the film , was most likely included because Anderton was a big fan of classical music in the script . Some of the other choices , such as Gideon 's playing of Jesu , Joy of Man 's Desiring by Bach on an organ in the subterranean prison , were also in the screenplay , and he figured that " [ t ] hey are some writer 's conception of what this character might have listened to . " Williams did choose the minuet from a Haydn string quartet ( Op. 64 , No. 1 ) which plays on the radio in the scene where Dr. Hineman is gardening in her greenhouse . He said he picked the piece because " [ i ] t seemed to me to be the kind of thing a woman like this would play on the radio . " The New York Times characterized the score as " evocative " and said it was " thoroughly modern " while also being " interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks . " The piece heard when Anderton is shown entering his apartment and he tells his computer system " I 'm home " is the 2nd movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky 's Symphony No. 6 in B minor , known as the " Pathetique " Symphony . 
 = = Ending = = 
 The most commonly criticized element of the film is its ending . The film has a more traditional " happy ending " which contradicts the tone of the rest of the picture . This has led to speculation that this ending is the product of John 's imagination , caused by hallucinations from his forced coma after he is incarcerated . As one observer mused , " The conclusion of Minority Report strikes me as a joke Spielberg played on his detractors — an act of perfectly measured <unk> . " 
 One critic theorized , " ... [ r ] ather than end this Brazil @-@ ian sci @-@ fi dystopia with the equivalent of that film 's shot of its lobotomized hero , which puts the lie to the immediately previous scene of his imagined liberation , Spielberg tries to pass off the exact same ending but without the rimshot , just to see if the audience is paying attention . " Film scholars Nigel Morris and Jason P. Vest point to a line in the film as possible evidence of this . After Anderton is captured , Gideon tells him that , " It 's actually kind of a rush . They say you have visions . That your life flashes before your eyes . That all your dreams come true . " While Vest considers the blissful dream ending a possibility , he questions why Anderton did not imagine his son as having returned . 
 Buckland expressed disappointment in the ending , but blamed Frank . He felt that given the water theme , and closely tied together tragic parent @-@ child theme , Anderton should have ended the film by taking Agatha in his care if Spielberg wanted a happy ending . Especially since " Anderton kidnaps Agatha from the precog pool just as his son was kidnapped from a swimming pool " and because Anderton could act as a " substitute parent for Agatha , and Agatha ... a substitute child for Anderton . " This opportunity is missed however , when the precogs are sent to the remote island , and Anderton reunites with his wife ; an ending which Buckland finds more " forced " than the " more authentic " path he feels he noticed . 
 = = Style = = 
 Minority Report is a futuristic film which portrays elements of a both dystopian and utopian future . The movie renders a much more detailed view of its future world than the book , and contains new technologies not in Dick 's story . From a stylistic standpoint , Minority Report resembles Spielberg 's previous film A.I. , but also incorporates elements of film noir . Spielberg said that he " wanted to give the movie a noir feel . So I threw myself a film festival . Asphalt Jungle . Key Largo . The Maltese Falcon . " The picture was deliberately overlit , and the negative was bleach @-@ bypassed during post @-@ production . The scene in which Anderton is dreaming about his son 's kidnapping at the pool is the only one shot in " normal " color . Bleach @-@ bypassing gave the film a distinctive look ; it desaturated the film 's colors , to the point that it nearly resembles a black @-@ and @-@ white movie , yet the blacks and shadows have a high contrast like a film noir picture . The color was reduced by " about 40 % " to achieve the " washed @-@ out " appearance . Elvis Mitchell , formerly of The New York Times , commented that " [ t ] he picture looks as if it were shot on chrome , caught on the fleeing bumper of a late ' 70s car . " 
 Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński shot the movie with high @-@ speed film , which Spielberg preferred to the then @-@ emerging digital video format . The movie 's camera work is very mobile , alternating between handheld and Steadicam shots , which are " exaggerated by the use of wide angle lenses and the occasional low camera angle " to increase the perception of movement according to film scholar Warren Buckland . Kamiński said that he never used a lens longer than 27mm , and alternated between 17 , 21 , and 27mm lenses , as Spielberg liked to " keep the actors as close to the camera as possible " . He also said , " We staged a lot of scenes in wide shots that have a lot of things happening with the frame . " The duo also used several long takes to focus on the emotions of the actors , rather than employing numerous cuts . Spielberg eschewed the typical " shot reverse shot " cinematography technique used when filming characters ' interactions in favor of the long takes , which were shot by a mobile , probing camera . McDowell relied on colorless chrome and glass objects of curved and circular shapes in his set designs , which , aided by the " low @-@ key contrastive lighting " , populated the film with shadows , creating a " futuristic film noir atmosphere " . 
 Buckland describes the film 's 14 minute opening sequence as the " most abstract and complex of any Spielberg film . " The first scene is a distorted precog vision of a murder , presented out of context . The speed of the film is sped up , slowed , and even reversed , and the movie " jumps about in time and space " by intercutting the images in no discernible order . When it ends , it becomes clear that the scene was presented through Agatha 's eyes , and that this is how <unk> appear to her . Fellow scholar Nigel Morris called this scene a " trailer " , because it foreshadows the plot and establishes the type of " tone , generic expectations , and enigmas " that will be used in the film . The visions of the pre @-@ cogs are presented in a fragmented series of clips using a " squishy lens " device , which distorts the images , blurring their edges and creating ripples across them . They were created by a two @-@ man production team , hired by Spielberg , who chose the " layered , dreamlike imagery " based on some comments from cognitive psychologists the pair consulted . In the opening 's next scene , Anderton is " scrubbing the images " , by standing like a composer ( as Spielberg terms it ) , and manipulating them , while Jad assists him . Next the family involved in the murder in Agatha 's vision is shown interacting , which establishes that the opening scene was a <unk> . The picture then cuts back to Anderton and the precogs ' images , before alternating between the three . The opening is self @-@ contained , and according to Buckland acts merely as a setup for numerous elements of the story . It lasts 14 minutes , includes 171 shots , and has an average shot length of five seconds as opposed to the 6 @.@ 5 second average for the entire film . The opening 's five @-@ second average is attained despite " very fast cutting " in the beginning and ending , because the middle has longer takes , which reach 20 seconds in some instances . Spielberg also continues his tradition of " heavily diffused backlighting " for much in the interior shots . 
 = = Release = = 
 Spielberg typically keeps the plot points of his films closely guarded before their release , and Minority Report was no different . He said he had to remove some scenes , and a few " F @-@ words " to get the film 's PG @-@ 13 rating . Following the disappointing box office results of Spielberg 's A.I. , the marketing campaign for Minority Report downplayed his role in the movie and sold the film as a Cruise action thriller . 
 Tom Rothman , chairman of the film 's co @-@ financier Fox Filmed Entertainment , described the film 's marketing strategy thus : " How are we marketing it ? It 's Cruise and Spielberg . What else do we need to do ? " The strategy made sense ; coming into the film , Spielberg had made 20 films which grossed a domestic total of $ 2 @.@ 8 billion , while Cruise 's resume featured 23 films and $ 2 billion in domestic revenues . With their combined 30 % take of the film 's box office though , sources such as BusinessWeek 's Ron Grover predicted the studios would have a hard time making the money needed to break even . Despite the outward optimism , as a more adult @-@ oriented , darker film than typical blockbusters , the studio held different box office expectations for the movie than they would a more family friendly film . Entertainment Weekly projected the film would gross $ 40 million domestic in its opening weekend , and Variety predicted that the high concept storyline would not appeal to children and would render it a " commercial extra @-@ base hit rather than a home run . "

 Minority Report 's world premiere took place in New York City on June 19 , 2002 . An online " popcorn cam " broadcast live from inside the premiere .

It debuted at first place in the U.S. box office , collecting $ 35 @.@ 677 million in its opening weekend . Forbes considered those numbers below expectations , as they gave the film a small edge over Lilo & Stitch , which debuted in second place ( $ 35 @.@ 260 million ) . Lilo & Stitch sold more tickets , but since much of the film 's attendees were children , its average ticket price was much lower . The movie opened at the top of the box office in numerous foreign markets ; it made $ 6 @.@ 7 million in 780 locations in Germany its opening weekend , and accounted for 35 % of France 's total box office weekend office gross when it collected $ 5 million in 700 theaters .

 The film received positive reviews . On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , Minority Report received 90 % positive reviews based on 239 critics , with an average rating of 8 @.@ 2 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus is , " Thought @-@ provoking and visceral , Steven Spielberg successfully combines high concept ideas and high octane action in this fast and febrile sci @-@ fi thriller . " The website listed it among the best reviewed films of 2002 . The film also earned an 80 out of a possible 100 on the similar review aggregating website Metacritic . Most critics gave the film 's handling of its central theme ( free will vs. determinism ) positive reviews , and many ranked it as the film 's main strength . Other reviewers however , felt that Spielberg did not adequately tackle the issues he raised . The movie has inspired significant discussion and analysis , the scope of which has been compared to the continuing analysis of Blade Runner . This discussion has advanced past the realm of standard film criticism . Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek fashioned a criticism of the Cheney Doctrine , by comparing its preemptive strike methodology to that of the film 's PreCrime system . 
 Richard Corliss of Time said its " Spielberg 's sharpest , <unk> , most bustling entertainment since Raiders of the Lost Ark " . Mike Clark of USA Today felt it succeeded due to a " breathless 140 @-@ minute pace with a no @-@ flab script packed with all kinds of surprises . " Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly praised the film 's visuals , and Todd McCarthy of Variety complimented the cast 's performances . Film scholar Warren Buckland recommended the film , but felt that the comedic elements — aside from Stormare 's lines — detracted from the plot and undermined the film 's credibility . 
 Several critics used their reviews to discuss Spielberg and analyze what the movie signified in his development as a filmmaker . Andrew O 'Hehir of the online magazine Salon expressed excitement over the atypically hard edge of the movie . " Little Steven Spielberg is all grown up now ... into of all things a superior film artist ... It 's too early to know whether Minority Report , on the heels of A.I. , marks a brief detour in Spielberg 's career or a permanent change of course , but either way it 's a dark and dazzling spectacle . " J. Hoberman of the The Village Voice said it is " the most entertaining , least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since Jurassic Park . " Randy Shulman of Metro Weekly said that " the movie is a huge leap forward for the director , who moves once and for all into the world of adult movie making . " Roger Ebert called the film a " masterpiece " and said that when most directors of the period were putting " their trust in technology " , Spielberg had already mastered it , and was emphasizing " story and character " while merely using technology as a " workman uses his tools " . David Edelstein of Slate echoed the positive sentiments , saying " [ i ] t has been a long time since a Spielberg film felt so nimble , so unfettered , so free of self @-@ cannibalizing . " Jonathan Rosenbaum , then of the Chicago Reader , was less convinced . Though he approved of the movie , he derided it in his review as a superficial action film , cautioning audiences to enjoy the movie , but not " be conned into thinking that some sort of serious , thoughtful statement is being delivered along with the roller @-@ coaster ride . " 
 Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer gave the film a negative review in which he described the script as full of plot holes , the car chases as silly , and criticized the mixture of futuristic environments with " defiantly retro costuming " . The complexity of the storyline was also a source of criticism for Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times , who considered the plot " too intricate and difficult to follow " . Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail criticized Tom Cruise 's performance , and though Hoberman liked the movie , he described the film as " miscast , misguided , and often nonsensical " . Both Rosenbaum and Hoberman belittled the titular minority report as a " red herring " . More positive reviews have seen it similarly , but referred to it as a " MacGuffin " .

 = Thaddeus Stevens = 
 Thaddeus Stevens ( April 4 , 1792 – August 11 , 1868 ) was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania and one of the leaders of the Radical Republican faction of the Republican Party during the 1860s . A fierce opponent of slavery and discrimination against African @-@ Americans , Stevens sought to secure their rights during Reconstruction , in opposition to President Andrew Johnson . As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee during the American Civil War , he played a major part in the war 's financing . 
 Stevens was born in rural Vermont , in poverty , and with a club foot , giving him a limp he kept his entire life . He moved to Pennsylvania as a young man , and quickly became a successful lawyer in Gettysburg . He interested himself in municipal affairs , and then in politics . He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives , where he became a strong advocate of free public education . Financial setbacks in 1842 caused him to move his home and practice to the larger city of Lancaster . There , he joined the Whig Party , and was elected to Congress in 1848 . His activities as a lawyer and politician in opposition to slavery cost him votes and he did not seek reelection in 1852 . After a brief flirtation with the Know @-@ Nothing Party , Stevens joined the newly formed Republican Party , and was elected to Congress again in 1858 . There , with fellow radicals such as Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner , he opposed the expansion of slavery and concessions to the South as war came . 
 Stevens argued that slavery should not survive the war ; he was frustrated by the slowness of President Abraham Lincoln to support his position . He guided the government 's financial legislation through the House as Ways and Means chairman . As the war progressed towards a northern victory , Stevens came to believe that not only should slavery be abolished , but that African @-@ Americans should be given a stake in the South 's future through the confiscation of land from planters to be distributed to the freedmen . His plans went too far for the Moderate Republicans , and were not enacted . 
 After Lincoln 's assassination in April 1865 , Stevens came into conflict with the new president , Johnson , who sought rapid restoration of the seceded states without guarantees for freedmen . The difference in views caused an ongoing battle between Johnson and Congress , with Stevens leading the Radical Republicans . After gains in the 1866 election the radicals took control of Reconstruction away from Johnson . Stevens 's last great battle was to secure articles of impeachment in the House against Johnson , though the Senate did not convict the President . Historiographical views of Stevens have dramatically shifted over the years , from the early 20th @-@ century view of Stevens as reckless and motivated by hatred of the white South , to the perspective of the <unk> of the 1950s and afterwards , who applauded him for his egalitarian views . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Stevens was born in Danville , Vermont , on April 4 , 1792 . He was the second of four children , all boys , and was named to honor the Polish general who served in the American Revolution , Thaddeus Kościuszko . His parents were Baptists who had emigrated from Massachusetts around 1786 . Thaddeus was born with a club foot , at the time seen as a judgment from God for secret parental sin — and his older brother was born with the condition in both feet . The boys ' father , Joshua Stevens , was a farmer and cobbler who struggled to make a living in Vermont . After fathering two more sons ( born without disability ) Joshua abandoned the children and his wife Sarah ( née Morrill ) . The circumstances of his departure and his subsequent fate are uncertain ; he may have died at the Battle of Oswego during the War of 1812 . 
 Sarah Stevens struggled to make a living from the farm , with the increasing aid of her sons . She was determined that her sons improve themselves , and in 1807 moved the family to the neighboring town of Peacham , where she enrolled young Thaddeus in the Caledonia Grammar School ( often called the Peacham Academy ) . He suffered much from the taunts of his classmates for his disability . Later accounts describe him there as " wilful , headstrong " with " an overwhelming burning desire to secure an education " . 
 After graduation , he enrolled at Burlington College of the University of Vermont , but suspended his studies due to the federal government 's appropriation of campus buildings during the War of 1812 . Stevens then enrolled in the sophomore class at Dartmouth College in Hanover , New Hampshire . At Dartmouth , despite a stellar academic career , he was not elected to Phi Beta Kappa ; this was reportedly a scarring experience for him . 
 Stevens graduated from Dartmouth in 1814 , and was chosen as a commencement speaker . Afterwards , he returned to Peacham and briefly taught there . Stevens also began to study law with Judge John <unk> in Danville . In early 1815 , after writing to friends in York , Pennsylvania , he moved there .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 In Pennsylvania , Stevens taught school at the York Academy and continued his studies for the bar . Local lawyers passed a resolution barring from membership anyone who had " followed any other profession while preparing for admission . " , a restriction likely aimed at Stevens . Undaunted , he reportedly ( according to a story he often retold ) presented himself and four bottles of Madeira wine to the examining board in nearby Harford County , Maryland , and few questions were asked but much wine drunk . He left Bel Air the next morning with a certificate allowing him , through reciprocity , to practice law anywhere . Stevens then went to Gettysburg , the seat of Adams County , where he opened an office in September 1816 . 
 Stevens knew no one in Gettysburg , and initially had little success as a lawyer . His breakthrough , in mid @-@ 1817 , was a case in which a farmer who had been jailed for debt later killed one of the constables who had arrested him . His defense , although unsuccessful , impressed the local people , and he never lacked for business thereafter . In his legal career , he demonstrated the propensity for sarcasm that would later mark him as a politician , once telling a judge who accused him of manifesting contempt , " Sir , I am doing my best to conceal it . " 
 Many who memorialized Stevens after his death in 1868 agreed on his talent as a lawyer . He was involved in the first ten cases to reach the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from Adams County after he began practice , and won nine . One case he later wished he had not won was Butler v. <unk> , in which he successfully reclaimed a slave on behalf of her owner . 
 In Gettysburg , Stevens also began his involvement in politics , serving six one @-@ year terms on the borough council between 1822 and 1831 and becoming its president . He took the profits from his practice and invested them in Gettysburg real estate , becoming the largest landowner in the community by 1825 , and had an interest in several iron furnaces outside town . In addition to assets , he acquired enemies ; after the death of a pregnant black woman in Gettysburg , there were anonymous letter @-@ writers to newspapers , hinting that Stevens was culpable . The rumors dogged him for years ; when one newspaper opposed to Stevens printed a letter in 1831 naming him as the killer , he successfully sued for libel .

 Stevens 's first political cause was Anti @-@ Masonry , which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance and death of William Morgan , a Mason in Upstate New York ; fellow masons were presumed to be the killers of Morgan because they disapproved of his publishing a book revealing the order 's secret rites . Since the leading candidate in opposition to President John Quincy Adams was General Andrew Jackson , a Mason who mocked opponents of the order , Anti @-@ Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson , and to his policies once he was elected president in 1828 . 
 Jackson 's adherents were from the old Democratic @-@ Republican Party and eventually became known as the Democrats . Stevens had been told by fellow attorney ( and future president ) James Buchanan that he could advance politically if he joined them , but Stevens could not support Jackson , out of principle . For Stevens , Anti @-@ Masonry became one means of opposing Jackson ; he may also have had personal reasons as the Masons barred " cripples " from joining . Stevens took to Anti @-@ Masonry with enthusiasm , and remained loyal to it after most Pennsylvanians had dropped the cause . His biographer , Hans Trefousse , suggested that another reason for Stevens 's virulence was an attack of disease in the late 1820s that cost him his hair ( he thereafter wore wigs , often ill @-@ fitting ) , and " the unwelcome illness may well have contributed to his unreasonable fanaticism concerning the Masons " . 
 By 1829 , Anti @-@ Masonry had evolved into a political party that proved popular in rural central Pennsylvania . Stevens quickly became prominent in the movement , attending the party 's first two national conventions in 1830 and 1831 . At the latter , he pressed the candidacy of Supreme Court Justice John McLean as the party 's presidential candidate , but in vain as the nomination fell to former Attorney General William Wirt . Jackson was easily reelected ; the crushing defeat ( Wirt won only Vermont ) caused the party to disappear in most places , though it remained powerful in Pennsylvania for several years . 
 In September 1833 , Stevens was elected to a one @-@ year term in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as an Anti @-@ Mason , and once in Harrisburg sought to have the body establish a committee to investigate Masonry . Stevens gained attention far beyond Pennsylvania for his oratory against Masonry , and also quickly became expert in legislative maneuvers . In 1835 , a split among the Democrats put the Anti @-@ Masons in control of the legislature . Granted subpoena powers , Stevens summoned leading state politicians who were Masons , including Governor George Wolf . The witnesses invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self @-@ incrimination , and when Stevens verbally abused one of them , it created a backlash that caused his own party to end the investigation . The fracas cost Stevens reelection in 1836 , and the issue of Anti @-@ Masonry died in Pennsylvania . Nevertheless , Stevens remained an opponent of the order for the rest of his life . 
 = = = Crusader for education = = = 
 Beginning with his early years in Gettysburg , Stevens advanced the cause of universal education . At the time , no state outside New England had free public education for all . In Pennsylvania , there was free education in Philadelphia , but elsewhere in the state , those wishing to have their children educated without paying tuition had to swear a pauper 's oath . Stevens opened his extensive private library to the public and gave up his presidency of the borough council , believing his service on the school board more important . In 1825 , he was elected by the voters of Adams County as a trustee of Gettysburg Academy . As the school was failing , Stevens got county voters to agree to pay its debt , allowing it to be sold as a Lutheran seminary . It was granted the right to award college degrees in 1831 as Pennsylvania College , and in 1921 became Gettysburg College . Stevens gave the school land upon which a building could be raised and for many years served as a trustee . 
 In April 1834 , Stevens , working with Governor Wolf , guided through the legislature an act to allow districts across the state to vote on whether to have public schools and the taxes to pay for them . Gettysburg 's district voted in favor , and also elected Stevens as a school director , where he served until 1839 . Tens of thousands of voters signed petitions urging a reversal . The result was a repeal bill that easily passed the Senate . It was widely believed the bill would also pass the House , and be enacted despite opposition by Stevens . When he rose to speak on April 11 , 1835 , he defended the new educational system , stating that it would actually save money , and demonstrated how . He stated opponents were seeking to separate the poor into a lower caste than themselves , and accused the rich of greed and failure to empathize with the poor . Stevens argued , " Build not your monuments of brass or marble , but make them of <unk> mind ! " The repeal bill was defeated ; Stevens was given wide credit . Trefousse suggested that the victory was not due to Stevens 's eloquence , but due to his influence , combined with that of Governor Wolf . 
 = = = Political change ; move to Lancaster = = = 
 In 1838 , Stevens ran again for the legislature . He hoped that if the remaining Anti @-@ Masons and the emerging Whig Party gained a majority , he could be elected to the United States Senate , whose members until 1913 were chosen by state legislatures . A campaign dirty even by the standards of the times followed . The result was a Democrat elected as governor , Whig control of the state Senate , and the state House in dispute , with a number of seats from Philadelphia in question , though Stevens won his seat in Adams County . Stevens sought to have those Philadelphia Democrats excluded , which would create a Whig majority that could elect a Speaker and himself as senator . Amid rioting in Harrisburg — later known as the " Buckshot War " — Stevens 's ploy backfired , with the Democrats taking control of the House . Stevens remained in the legislature most years through 1842 , but the episode cost him much of his political influence , as the Whigs blamed him for the debacle and were increasingly unwilling to give leadership to someone who had not yet joined their party . Nevertheless , he supported the pro @-@ business and pro @-@ development Whig stances . He campaigned for the Whig candidate in the 1840 presidential election , former general William Henry Harrison . Though Stevens later alleged that Harrison had promised him a Cabinet position if elected , he received none , and any influence ended when Harrison died after a month in office , to be succeeded by John Tyler , a southerner hostile to Stevens 's stances on slavery . 
 Although Stevens was the most successful lawyer in Gettysburg , he had accrued debt due to his business interests . Refusing to take advantage of the bankruptcy laws , he felt he needed to move to a larger municipality in order to gain the money to pay his obligations . In 1842 , Stevens moved his home and practice to the city of Lancaster . He knew Lancaster County was an Anti @-@ Mason and Whig stronghold , which ensured that he retained a political base . Within a short period , he was earning more than any other Lancaster attorney ; by 1848 he had reduced his debts to $ 30 @,@ 000 , and paid them off soon after . It was in Lancaster that he engaged the services of Lydia Hamilton Smith , a mulatto housekeeper who remained with him the rest of his life . 
 = = Abolitionist and prewar congressman = = 
 = = = Evolution of views = = = 
 In the 1830s , few sought the immediate eradication of slavery . The abolitionist movement was young and only recently had figures such as William Lloyd Garrison taken on the fight . Stevens 's reason for adopting slavery as a cause has been disputed among his recent biographers . Richard Current in 1942 , suggested it was out of ambition ; Fawn Brodie , in her controversial 1959 psychobiography of Stevens , suggested it was out of identification with the downtrodden , based on his handicap . Trefousse , in his 1997 work , also suggested that Stevens 's feelings towards the downtrodden were a factor , combined with remorse over the Butler case , but that ambition was unlikely to have been a major motivator , as Stevens 's fervor in the anti @-@ slavery cause inhibited his career . 
 At the Pennsylvania constitutional convention in 1837 , Stevens , who was a delegate , fought against the disenfranchisement of African @-@ Americans , though he was willing to support a minimum property requirement for all voters . According to historian Eric Foner , " When Stevens refused to sign the 1837 constitution because of its voting provision , he announced his commitment to a non @-@ racial definition of American citizenship to which he would adhere for the remainder of his life " . After he moved to Lancaster , a city not far from the Mason – Dixon line , he became active in the Underground Railroad , not only defending people believed to be fugitive slaves , but coordinating the movements of those seeking freedom . A 2003 renovation at his former home in Lancaster disclosed that there was a hidden cistern , attached to the main building by a concealed tunnel , in which escaped slaves hid . 
 Stevens , until the outbreak of the Civil War , took the public position that he supported slavery 's end and opposed its expansion . Nevertheless , he would not seek to disturb it in the states where it existed as the Constitution protected their internal affairs from outside interference . He also supported slaveowning Whig candidates for president : Henry Clay in 1844 and Zachary Taylor in 1848 . 
 = = = First tenure in Congress = = = 
 In 1848 , Stevens ran for election to Congress from Pennsylvania 's 8th congressional district . There was opposition to him at the Whig convention . Some delegates felt that because Stevens had been late to join the party , he should not receive the nomination ; others disliked his stance on slavery . He narrowly won the nomination . In a strong year for Whigs nationally , Taylor was chosen as president and Stevens was elected to Congress . 
 When Congress convened in December 1849 , Stevens took his seat , joining other newly elected slavery opponents such as Salmon P. Chase . Stevens spoke out against the Compromise of 1850 , crafted by Kentucky Senator Henry Clay , that gave victories to both North and South , but would allow for some of the territories recently gained from Mexico to become slave states . In June , as the debates continued , he stated , " This word ' compromise ' when applied to human rights and constitutional rights I abhor " . Nevertheless , the pieces of legislation that made up the Compromise passed , including the Fugitive Slave Act , which Stevens found particularly offensive . Although many Americans hoped that the Compromise would bring sectional peace , Stevens warned that it would be " the fruitful mother of future rebellion , disunion , and civil war " . 
 Stevens was easily renominated and reelected in 1850 , even though his stance caused him problems among pro @-@ Compromise Whigs . In 1851 , Stevens was one of the defense lawyers in the trial of 38 African @-@ Americans and three others in federal court in Philadelphia on treason charges . The defendants had been implicated in the so @-@ called Christiana Riot , in which an attempt to enforce a Fugitive Slave Act warrant had resulted in the killing of the slaveowner . Justice Robert Grier of the U.S. Supreme Court , as circuit justice , tried the case , and instructed the jury to acquit on the grounds that though the defendants might be guilty of murder or riot , they were not charged with that , and were not guilty of treason . The well @-@ publicized incident ( and others like it ) increased polarization over the issue of slavery and made Stevens a prominent face of Northern abolitionism . 
 Despite this trend , Stevens suffered political problems . He left the Whig caucus in December 1851 , when his colleagues would not join him in seeking the repeal of the offensive elements of the Compromise , though he supported its unsuccessful 1852 candidate for president , General Winfield Scott . His political opposition , and local dislike of his stance on slavery and participation in the treason trial , made him unlikely to win renomination , and he sought only to pick his successor . His choice was defeated for the Whig nomination . 
 = = = Know @-@ Nothing and Republican = = = 
 Out of office , Stevens concentrated on the practice of law in Lancaster , remaining one of the leading attorneys in the state . He stayed active in politics , and in 1854 , to gain more votes for the anti @-@ slavery movement , he joined the nativist Know Nothing Party . The members were pledged not to speak of party deliberations ( thus , they knew nothing ) , and Stevens was attacked for his membership in a group with similar rules of secrecy as the Masons . In 1855 , Stevens joined the new Republican Party . Other former Whigs who were anti @-@ slavery joined as well , including William H. Seward of New York , Charles E. Sumner of Massachusetts , and Abraham Lincoln of Illinois . 
 Stevens was a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention , where he supported Justice McLean , as he had in 1832 . The convention , however , nominated John C. Frémont , whom Stevens actively supported in the race against his fellow Lancastrian , the Democratic candidate James Buchanan . Nonetheless , Pennsylvania helped elect Buchanan . Stevens returned to the practice of law , but by 1858 , with the President and his party unpopular and the nation torn by such controversies as the Dred Scott decision , Stevens saw an opportunity to return to Congress . As the Republican nominee , he was easily elected . Democratic papers were appalled . One banner headline read , " <unk> Triumphant " . 
 = = = 1860 election ; secession crisis = = = 
 Stevens took his seat in Congress in December 1859 , only days after the hanging of John Brown , who had attacked the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry hoping to cause a slave insurrection . Stevens opposed Brown 's violent actions at the time , though later , he was more approving . Sectional tensions spilled over into the House , which proved unable to elect a Speaker for eight weeks . Stevens was active in the bitter flow of invective from both sides ; at one point , Mississippi Congressman William Barksdale drew a knife on him , though no blood was spilled . 
 With the Democrats unable to agree on a single presidential candidate , the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago became crucial , as the nominee would be in a favorable position to become president . Prominent figures in the party such as Seward and Lincoln sought the nomination . Stevens continued to support the 75 @-@ year @-@ old Justice McLean . Beginning on the second ballot , most Pennsylvania delegates supported Lincoln , helping to win the Illinoisan the nomination . As the Democrats put up no candidate in his district , Stevens was assured of reelection to the House , and campaigned for Lincoln in Pennsylvania . Lincoln won a majority in the Electoral College . The President @-@ elect 's known opposition to the expansion of slavery caused immediate talk of secession in the southern states , a threat that Stevens had downplayed during the campaign . 
 Congress convened in December 1860 , with several of the southern states already pledging to secede . Stevens was unyielding in opposing efforts to appease the southerners , such as the Crittenden Compromise , which would have enshrined slavery as beyond constitutional amendment . He stated , in a remark widely quoted both North and South , that rather than offer concessions because of Lincoln 's election , he would see " this Government crumble into a thousand atoms " , and that the forces of the United States would crush any rebellion . Despite Stevens 's protests , the lame @-@ duck Buchanan administration did little in response to the secession votes , allowing most federal resources in the South to fall into rebel hands . Many , even in the abolition movement , were content to let it be so , and to let the South go its own way . Stevens did not agree , and the congressman was " undoubtedly pleased " by Lincoln 's statement in his first inaugural address on March 4 , 1861 , that he would " hold , occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the Government " . 
 = = American Civil War = = 
 = = = Slavery = = = 
 When war began in April 1861 , Stevens argued that the Confederates were revolutionaries , to be crushed by force . He also believed that the Confederacy had placed itself beyond the protection of the U.S. Constitution by making war , and in a reconstituted United States , slavery would have no place . Speaker Galusha Grow , whose views placed him with Stevens among the members becoming known as the Radical Republican ( for their position on slavery , as opposed to the Conservative or Moderate Republicans ) , appointed him as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee . This position gave him power over the House 's agenda . 
 In July 1861 , Stevens secured the passage of an act to confiscate the property , including slaves , of certain rebels . In November 1861 , Stevens introduced a resolution to emancipate all slaves ; it was defeated . However , legislation did pass that abolished slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories . By March 1862 , to Stevens 's exasperation , the most Lincoln had publicly supported was gradual emancipation in the Border states , with the masters compensated by the federal government . 
 Stevens and other radicals were frustrated at how slow Lincoln was to adopt their policies for emancipation ; according to Brodie , " Lincoln seldom succeeded in matching Stevens 's pace , though both were marching towards the same bright horizon " . In April 1862 , Stevens wrote to a friend , " As for future hopes , they are poor as Lincoln is nobody . " The radicals aggressively pushed the issue , provoking Lincoln to comment : " Stevens , Sumner and [ Massachusetts Senator Henry ] Wilson simply haunt me with their importunities for a Proclamation of Emancipation . Wherever I go and whatever way I turn , they are on my tail , and still in my heart , I have the deep conviction that the hour [ to issue one ] has not yet come . " The President stated that if it came to a showdown between the radicals and their enemies , he would have to side with Stevens and his fellows , and deemed them " the <unk> devils in the world to deal with " but " with their faces ... set <unk> " . Although Lincoln composed his proclamation in June and July 1862 , the secret was held within his Cabinet , and the President turned aside radical pleadings to issue one until after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September . Stevens quickly adopted the Emancipation Proclamation for use in his successful reelection campaign . When Congress returned in December , Stevens maintained his criticism of Lincoln 's policies , calling them " flagrant usurpations , deserving the condemnation of the community " . Stevens generally opposed Lincoln 's plans to colonize freed slaves abroad , though sometimes he supported emigration proposals for political reasons . Stevens wrote a nephew in June 1863 saying , " The slaves ought to be incited to insurrection and give the rebels a taste of real civil war . " 
 During the Confederate incursion into the North in mid @-@ 1863 that culminated in the Battle of Gettysburg , Confederates twice sent parties to Stevens 's Caledonia Forge . Stevens , who had been there supervising operations , was hastened away by his workers against his will . General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge , causing a loss to Stevens of about $ 80 @,@ 000 . Early said that the North had done the same to southern figures , and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South . Asked if he would have taken the congressman to Libby Prison in Richmond , Early replied that he would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states . 
 Stevens pushed Congress to pass a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery . The Emancipation Proclamation was a wartime measure , did not apply to all slaves , and might be reversed by peacetime courts ; an amendment would be slavery 's end . The Thirteenth Amendment — which outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime — easily passed the Senate , but failed in the House in June ; fears that it might not pass delayed a renewed attempt there . Lincoln campaigned aggressively for the amendment after his re @-@ election in 1864 , and Stevens described his December annual message to Congress as " the most important and best message that has been communicated to Congress for the last 60 years " . Stevens closed the debate on the amendment on January 13 , 1865 . Illinois Representative Isaac Arnold wrote : " distinguished soldiers and citizens filled every available seat , to hear the eloquent old man speak on a measure that was to consummate the warfare of forty years against slavery " . 
 The amendment passed narrowly after heavy pressure exerted by Lincoln himself , along with offers of political appointments from the " Seward lobby " . Allegations of bribery were made by Democrats ; Stevens stated " the greatest measure of the nineteenth century was passed by corruption , aided and abetted by the purest man in America . " The amendment was declared ratified on December 18 , 1865 . Stevens continued to push for a broad interpretation of it that included economic justice in addition to the formal end of slavery . 
 After passing the Thirteenth Amendment , Congress debated the economic rights of the freedmen . Urged on by Stevens , it voted to authorize the Bureau of Refugees , Freedmen , and Abandoned Lands , with a mandate ( though no funding ) to set up schools and to distribute " not more than forty acres " [ 16 ha ] of confiscated Confederate land to each family of freed slaves . 
 = = = Financing the war = = = 
 Stevens worked closely with Lincoln administration officials on legislation to finance the war . Within a day of his appointment as Ways and Means chairman , he had reported a bill for a war loan . Legislation to pay the soldiers Lincoln had already called into service and to allow the administration to borrow to prosecute the war quickly followed . These acts and more were pushed through the House by Stevens . To defeat the delaying tactics of Copperhead opponents , he had the House set debate limits as short as half a minute . 
 Stevens played a major part in the passage of the Legal Tender Act of 1862 , when for the first time the United States issued currency backed only by its own credit , not by gold or silver . Early makeshifts to finance the war , such as war bonds , had failed as it became clear the war would not be short . In 1863 , Stevens aided the passage of the National Banking Act , that required that banks limit their currency issues to the amount of federal bonds that they were required to hold . The system endured for a half @-@ century , until supplanted by the Federal Reserve System in 1913 . 
 Although the Legal Tender legislation allowed for the payment of government obligations in paper money , Stevens was unable to get the Senate to agree that interest on the national debt should be paid with greenbacks . As the value of paper money dropped , Stevens railed against gold speculators , and in June 1864 after consultation with Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase , proposed what became known as the Gold Bill — to abolish the gold market by forbidding its sale by brokers or for future delivery . It passed Congress in June ; the chaos caused by the lack of an organized gold market caused the value of paper to drop even faster . Under heavy pressure from the business community , Congress repealed the bill on July 1 , twelve days after its passage . Stevens was unrepentant even as the value of paper currency recovered in late 1864 amid the expectation of Union victory , proposing legislation to make paying a premium in greenbacks for an amount in gold coin a criminal offense . It did not pass . 
 Stevens , like most Pennsylvania politicians of both parties , was a major proponent of tariffs , which increased from 19 % to 48 % from fiscal 1861 to fiscal 1865 . According to activist Ida Tarbell in " The Tariff in Our Times : " [ Import ] duties were never too high for [ Stevens ] , particularly for iron , for he was a manufacturer and it was often said in Pennsylvania that the duties he advocated in no way represented the large iron interests of the state , but were hoisted to cover the needs of his own ... badly managed works . "

 = = = Problem of reconstructing the South = = = 
 As Congress debated how the U.S. would be organized after the war , the status of freed slaves and former Confederates remained undetermined . Stevens stated that what was needed was a " radical reorganization of southern institutions , habits , and manners " . Stevens , Sumner and other radicals argued that the southern states should be treated like conquered provinces , without constitutional rights . Lincoln , on the contrary , said that only individuals , not states , had rebelled . In July 1864 , Stevens pushed Lincoln to sign the Wade – Davis Bill , which required at least half of prewar voters to sign an oath of loyalty for a state to gain readmission . Lincoln , who advocated his more lenient ten percent plan , pocket vetoed it . 
 Stevens reluctantly voted for Lincoln at the convention of the National Union Party , a coalition of Republicans and War Democrats . He would have preferred to vote for the sitting vice president , Hannibal Hamlin , as Lincoln 's running mate in 1864 , but his delegation voted to cast the state 's ballots for the administration 's favored candidate , Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson , a War Democrat who had been a Tennessee senator and elected governor . Stevens was disgusted at Johnson 's nomination , complaining , " can 't you get a candidate for Vice @-@ President without going down into a damned rebel province for one ? " Stevens campaigned for the Lincoln @-@ Johnson ticket ; it was elected , as was Stevens for another term in the House . When in January 1865 Congress learned that Lincoln had attempted peace talks with Confederate leaders , an outraged Stevens declared that if the American electorate could vote again , they would elect General Benjamin Butler instead of Lincoln . 
 = = = Presidential Reconstruction = = = 
 Before leaving town after Congress adjourned in March 1865 , Stevens privately urged Lincoln to press the South hard militarily , though the war was ending . Lincoln replied , " Stevens , this is a pretty big hog we are trying to catch and to hold when we catch him . We must take care that he does not slip away from us . " Never to see Lincoln again , Stevens left with " a homely metaphor but no real certainty of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln 's policy " . On the evening of April 14 , 1865 , Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth . Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln 's funeral train stopped in Lancaster ; he was said to be ill . Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons . According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg , Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat . 
 In May 1865 , Andrew Johnson began what came to be known as " Presidential Reconstruction " : recognizing a provisional government of Virginia led by Francis Harrison Pierpont , calling for other former rebel states to organize constitutional conventions , declaring amnesty for many southerners , and issuing individual pardons to even more . Johnson did not push the states to protect the rights of freed slaves , and immediately began to counteract the land reform policies of the Freedmen 's Bureau . These actions outraged Stevens and others who took his view . The radicals saw that freedmen in the South risked losing the economic and political liberty necessary to sustain emancipation from slavery . They began to call for universal male suffrage and continued their demands for land reform . 
 Stevens wrote to Johnson that his policies were gravely damaging the country and that he should call a special session of Congress , which was not scheduled to meet until December . When his communications were ignored , Stevens began to discuss with other radicals how to prevail over Johnson when the two houses convened . Congress has the constitutional power to be the judge of whether those seeking to be its members are properly elected ; Stevens urged that no senators or representatives from the South be seated . He argued that the states should not be readmitted as thereafter Congress would lack the power to force race reform . 
 In September , Stevens gave a widely reprinted speech in Lancaster in which he set forth what he wanted for the South . He proposed that the government confiscate the estates of the largest 70 @,@ 000 landholders there , those who owned more than 200 acres ( 81 ha ) . Much of this property he wanted distributed in plots of 40 acres ( 16 ha ) to the freedmen ; other lands would go to reward loyalists in both North and South , or to meet government obligations . He warned that under the President 's plan , the southern states would send rebels to Congress who would join with northern Democrats and Johnson to govern the nation and perhaps undo emancipation . 
 Through late 1865 , the southern states held white @-@ only balloting and in congressional elections , chose many former rebels , most prominently Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens , voted as senator by the Georgia Legislature . Violence against African @-@ Americans was common and unpunished in the South ; the new legislatures enacted Black Codes , depriving the freedmen of most civil rights . These actions , seen as provocative in the North , both privately dismayed Johnson and helped turn northern public opinion against him . 
 = = = Congressional Reconstruction = = = 
 By this time , Stevens was in his seventies and in poor health ; he was carried everywhere in a special chair . When Congress convened in early December 1865 , Stevens made arrangements with the Clerk of the House that when the roll was called , the names of the southern <unk> be omitted . The Senate also excluded southern claimants . A new congressman , Ohio 's Rutherford B. Hayes , described Stevens , " He is radical throughout , except , I am told , he don 't believe in hanging . He is leader . " 
 As the responsibilities of the Ways and Means chairman had been divided , Stevens took the post of chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations , retaining control over the House 's agenda . Stevens focused on legislation that would secure the freedom promised by the newly ratified Thirteenth Amendment . He proposed and then co @-@ chaired the Joint Committee on Reconstruction with Maine Senator William Pitt Fessenden . This body , also called the Committee of Fifteen , investigated conditions in the South . It heard not only of the violence against African @-@ Americans , but against Union loyalists , and against what southerners termed " carpetbaggers " , northerners who had journeyed south after the restoration of peace . Stevens declared : that " our loyal brethren at the South , whether they be black or white " required urgent protection " from the barbarians who are now daily murdering them . " 
 The Committee of Fifteen began consideration of what would become the Fourteenth Amendment . Stevens had begun drafting versions in December 1865 , before the Committee had even formed . In January 1866 , a subcommittee including Stevens and John Bingham proposed two amendments : one giving Congress the unqualified power to secure equal rights , privileges , and protections for all citizens ; the other explicitly annulling all racially discriminatory laws . Stevens believed that the Declaration of Independence and Organic Acts already bound the federal government to these principles , but that an amendment was necessary to allow enforcement against discrimination at the State level . The resolution providing for what would become the Fourteenth Amendment was watered down in Congress ; during the closing debate , Stevens said these changes had shattered his lifelong dream in equality for all Americans . Nevertheless , stating that he lived among men , not angels , he supported the passage of the compromise amendment . Still , Stevens told the House : " Forty acres of land and a hut would be more valuable to [ the African @-@ American ] than the immediate right to vote . " 
 When Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull introduced legislation to reauthorize and expand the Freedmen 's Bureau , Stevens called the Bill a " robbery " because it did not include sufficient provisions for land reform or protect the property of refugees given them by the military occupation of the South . Johnson vetoed the Bill anyway , calling the Freedmen 's Bureau unconstitutional , and decrying its cost — Congress had never purchased land , established schools , or provided financial help for " our own people " . Congress was unable to override Johnson 's veto in February , but five months later passed a similar bill . Stevens criticized the passage of the Southern Homestead Act of 1866 arguing that the low @-@ quality land it made available would not drive real economic growth for black families . 
 Congress overrode a Johnson veto to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1866 ( also introduced by Trumbull ) , granting African @-@ Americans citizenship and equality before the law , and forbidding any action by a state to the contrary . Johnson made the gap between him and Congress wider when he accused Stevens , Sumner , and Wendell Phillips of trying to destroy the government . 
 After Congress adjourned in July , the campaigning for the fall elections began . Johnson embarked on a trip by rail , dubbed the " Swing Around the Circle " , that won him few supporters ; his arguments with hecklers were deemed undignified . He attacked Stevens and other radicals during this tour . Stevens campaigned for firm measures against the South , his hand strengthened by violence in Memphis and New Orleans , where African @-@ Americans and white Unionists had been attacked by mobs , including the police . Stevens was returned to Congress by his constituents ; Republicans would have a two @-@ thirds majority in both houses in the next Congress . 
 = = = Radical Reconstruction = = = 
 In January 1867 , Stevens introduced legislation to divide the South into five districts , each commanded by an army general empowered to override civil authorities . These military officers were to supervise elections with all males , of whatever race , entitled to vote , except for those who could not take an oath of past loyalty — most white southerners could not . The states were to write new constitutions ( subject to approval by Congress ) and hold elections for state officials . Only if a state ratified the Fourteenth Amendment would its delegation be seated in Congress . The system gave power to a Republican coalitions of freedmen ( mobilized by the Union League ) , carpetbaggers and co @-@ operative southerners ( the last dubbed scalawags by indignant ex @-@ rebels ) in most southern states . These states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment , which became part of the Constitution in mid @-@ 1868 . 
 Stevens introduced a Tenure of Office Act , restricting Johnson from firing officials who had received Senate confirmation without getting that body 's consent . The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous , since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them , and most of the officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln . Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton , a radical himself . 
 Stevens steered a bill to enfranchise African @-@ Americans in the District of Columbia through the House ; the Senate passed it in 1867 , and it was enacted over Johnson 's veto . Congress was downsizing the Army for peacetime ; Stevens offered an amendment , which became part of the bill as enacted , to have two regiments of African @-@ American cavalry . His <unk> for African @-@ Americans extended to the Native American ; Stevens was successful in defeating a bill to place reservations under state law , noting that the native people had often been abused by the states . An expansionist , he supported the railroads . He added a stipulation into the [ Transcontinental ] Pacific Railroad Act requiring the applicable railroads to buy iron " of American manufacture " of the top price <unk> he sought to protect manufacturers with high tariffs , he also sought unsuccessfully to get a bill passed to protect labor with an eight @-@ hour day in the District of Columbia . Stevens advocated a bill to give government workers raises ; it did not pass . 
 = = <unk> the President = = 
 The new Congress , which convened on March 4 , 1867 , was not as aggressive in opposing Johnson as Stevens had hoped . It soon adjourned until July , though its Judiciary Committee remained to hold hearings on whether the President should be impeached . Stevens firmly supported impeachment , but others were less enthusiastic once the Senate elected Ohio 's Benjamin Wade as its president pro tempore , next in line to the presidency in the absence of a vice president . Wade was a radical who supported wealth redistribution ; a speech of his in Kansas so impressed Karl Marx that he mentioned it in the first German edition of Das Kapital . Also a supporter of women 's suffrage , Wade was widely mistrusted for his views ; the prospect of his succession made some advocates of Johnson 's removal more hesitant . Stevens , however , strongly supported the removal of the President , and when the Judiciary Committee failed to report , tried to keep Congress in session until it did . Despite his opposition to its leader , Stevens worked with the administration on matters both supported ; he obtained an appropriation for the purchase of Alaska and urged Secretary of State Seward to seek other territories to expand into . 
 Most of Johnson 's Cabinet supported him but Secretary of War Stanton did not , and with the General of the Army , war hero Ulysses S. Grant , worked to undermine Johnson 's Reconstruction policies . Johnson obeyed the laws that Congress had passed , sometimes over his veto , though he often interpreted them in ways contrary to their intent . After Stanton refused Johnson 's request that he resign in August 1867 , Johnson suspended Stanton , as permitted by the Tenure of Office Act , and made General Grant interim Secretary of War . Republicans campaigned in that year 's election on the issue of African @-@ American suffrage , but were met with a voter surge towards the Democrats , who opposed it . Although no seats at Congress were directly at stake , voters in Ohio both defeated a referendum on black suffrage and elected the Democrats to the majority in the legislature , meaning that Wade , whose term was due to expire in 1869 , would not be reelected . 
 When Congress met again in December , although the Judiciary Committee voted 5 – 4 for impeachment , the House voted against it . On January 13 , 1868 , the Senate overturned Johnson 's suspension of Stanton . Grant resigned as Secretary of War , and Stanton reclaimed his place . Nevertheless , on February 21 , the President ousted Stanton from his position , appointing General Lorenzo Thomas in his place — though Stanton barricaded himself in his office . These actions caused great excitement in Washington , and in the House of Representatives , Stevens went from group to group on the floor , repeating , " Didn 't I tell you so ? What good did your moderation do you ? If you don 't kill the beast , it will kill you . " Stevens concluded the debate on a renewed impeachment resolution on February 24 , though due to his poor health he was unable to complete his speech and gave it to the Clerk to read aloud . He accused Johnson of usurping the powers of other branches of government , and of ignoring the will of the people . He did not deny impeachment was a political matter , but " this is not to be the temporary triumph of a political party , but is to endure in its consequence until the whole continent shall be filled with a free and untrammeled people or shall be a nest of shrinking , cowardly slaves . " The House voted 126 – 47 to impeach the President . 
 Stevens led the delegation of House members sent the following day to inform the Senate of the impeachment , though he had to be carried to its doors by his bearers . Elected to the committee charged with drafting articles of impeachment , his illness limited his involvement . Nevertheless , dissatisfied with the committee 's proposed articles , Stevens suggested another , that would become Article XI . This grounded the various accusations in statements Johnson had made denying the legitimacy of Congress due to the exclusion of the southern states , and stated that Johnson had tried to disobey the Reconstruction Acts . Stevens was one of the managers , or prosecutors , elected by the House to present its case in the impeachment trial . Although Stevens was too ill to appear in the Senate on March 3 , when the managers requested that Johnson be summoned ( the President would appear only by his counsel , or defense managers ) , he was there ten days later when the summons was returnable . The New York Herald described him as having a " face of <unk> color , and rigidly twitching lips ... a strange and unearthly apparition — a <unk> remonstrance from the tomb ... the very embodiment of fanaticism , without a solitary leaven of justice or mercy ... the avenging Nemesis of his party — the sworn and implacable foe of the Executive of the nation " . 
 Increasingly ill , Stevens took little part in the impeachment trial , at which the leading House manager was Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Butler . Stevens nourished himself on the Senate floor with raw eggs and terrapin , port and brandy . He spoke only twice before making a closing argument for the House managers on April 27 . As he spoke , his voice weakened , and finally he allowed Butler to read the second half of his speech for him . Stevens focused on Article XI , taking the position that Johnson could be removed for political crimes ; he need not have committed an offense against the law . The President , having sworn to faithfully execute the laws , had intentionally disobeyed the Tenure of Office Act after the Senate had refused to uphold his removal of Stanton , " and now this offspring of assassination turns upon the Senate who have ... rebuked him in a constitutional manner and bids them defiance . How can he escape the just vengeance of the law ? " 
 Most radicals were confident that Johnson would be convicted and removed from office . Stevens , however , was never certain of the result as Chief Justice Chase ( the former Treasury Secretary ) made rulings that favored the defense , and he had no great confidence Republicans would stick together . On May 11 , the Senate met in secret session , and senators gave speeches explaining how they intended to vote . All Democrats were opposed , but an unexpectedly large number of Republicans also favored acquittal on some or all of the articles . Counting votes , managers realized their best chance of gaining the required two @-@ thirds for conviction was on the Stevens @-@ inspired Article XI , and when the Senate assembled to give its verdict , they scheduled it to be voted upon first . The suspense was broken when Kansas Senator Edmund Ross , whose position was uncertain , voted for acquittal . This meant that , with the votes of those who remained , the President would not be convicted on that article . The article failed , 35 in favor to 19 against . In the hope that delay would bring a different result , Republicans adjourned the Senate for ten days . Stevens was carried from the Senate in his chair — one observer described him as " black with rage and disappointment " — and when those outside clamored for the result , Stevens shouted , " The country is going to the devil ! "

 During the recess of the impeachment court , the Republicans met in convention in Chicago and nominated Grant for president . Stevens did not attend , and was dismayed by the exclusion of African @-@ American suffrage from the party platform as radical influence began to fade in the Republican Party . When the Senate returned to session , it voted down Articles II and III by the same 35 – 19 margin as before , and Chase declared the President acquitted . Stevens did not give up on the idea of removing Johnson ; in July , he proffered several more impeachment articles ( the House refused to adopt them ) . He offered a bill to divide Texas into several parts so as to gain additional Republican senators to vote out Johnson . It was defeated ; the Herald stated , " It is lamentable to see this old man , with one foot in the grave , pursuing the President with such vindictiveness . " Nevertheless , Stevens planned to revisit the question of impeachment when Congress met again in late 1868 . 
 Brodie suggested that Stevens 's hatred of Johnson was the only thing keeping him from despair , aware as he was of the continued violence in the South , some of which was committed by the Ku Klux Klan . Several of the southern states had been re @-@ admitted by this time , and the murders and intimidation were aiding the Democrats there in restoring white rule . With the Republicans unwilling to embrace black suffrage in their platform and the Democrats opposed to it , Stevens feared Democratic victory in the 1868 elections might even bring back slavery . He told his fellow Pennsylvania politician , Alexander McClure , " My life has been a failure . With all this great struggle of years in Washington , and the fearful sacrifice of life and treasure , I see little hope for the Republic . " , He took pride , he continued , in his role in establishing free public education in Pennsylvania . When interviewed by a reporter seeking to gain his life story , Stevens replied , " I have no history . My life @-@ long regret is that I have lived so long and so uselessly . " Nevertheless , in his last formal speech to the House , Stevens stated that " man still is vile . But such large steps have lately been taken in the true direction , that the patriot has a right to take courage . " 
 When Congress adjourned in late July , Stevens remained in Washington , too ill to return to Pennsylvania . Stevens was in pain from his stomach ailments , from swollen feet , and from dropsy . By early August , he was unable to leave the house . He still received some visitors though , and correctly predicted to his friend and former student Simon Stevens ( no relation ) that Grant would win the election . On the afternoon of August 11 , his doctor warned that he would probably not last through the night . His longtime housekeeper and companion , Lydia Hamilton Smith , his nephew Thaddeus , and friends gathered by him . Two black preachers came to pray by him , telling him that he had the prayers of all their people . He sucked on ice to try to sooth the pain ; his last words were a request for more of it . Thaddeus Stevens died on the night of August 11 , 1868 , as the old day departed . 
 President Johnson issued no statement upon the death of his enemy . Newspaper reaction was generally along partisan lines , though sometimes mixed . The Detroit Post stated that " if to die crowned with noble laurels , and ... secure of the respect of the world ... is an end worthy the ambition of a well spent life , then the veteran Radical may lie down with the noblest of the fathers to a well contented sleep " . The New York Times stated that Stevens had " discerned the expediency of emancipation , and urged it long before Mr. Lincoln issued his proclamation " but that after the war , " on the subject of Reconstruction , then , Mr. Stevens must be deemed the Evil Genius of the Republican Party . The [ Franklin , Louisiana ] Planter 's Banner exulted , " The prayers of the righteous have at last removed the Congressional curse ! May ... the fires of his new furnace never go out ! " 
 Stevens 's body was conveyed from his house to the Capitol by white and African @-@ American pallbearers together . Thousands of mourners , of both races , filed past his casket as he lay in state in the Rotunda ; Stevens was the third man , after Clay and Lincoln , to receive that honor . African @-@ American soldiers constituted the guard of honor . After a service there , his body was taken by funeral train to Lancaster , a city draped in black for the funeral . Stevens was laid to rest in <unk> 's Cemetery ( today the <unk> @-@ Concord Cemetery ) ; it allowed burial of people of all races , although at the time of Stevens 's interment , only one African @-@ American was buried there . The people of his district posthumously renominated him to Congress , and elected his former student , Oliver J. Dickey to succeed him . When Congress convened in December 1868 , there were a number of speeches in tribute to Stevens ; they were afterwards collected in book form . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Stevens never married , though there were rumors about his 20 @-@ year relationship ( 1848 – 1868 ) with his widowed housekeeper , Lydia Hamilton Smith ( 1813 – 1884 ) . She was a light @-@ skinned African @-@ American ; her husband Jacob and at least one of her sons were much darker than she was . 
 It is uncertain if the Stevens @-@ Smith relationship was romantic . The Democratic press , especially in the South , assumed so , and when he brought Mrs. Smith to Washington in 1859 , where she managed his household , that did nothing to stop their insinuations . In the one brief surviving letter from Stevens to her , Stevens addresses her as Mrs. Lydia Smith . Stevens insisted that his nieces and nephews refer to her as Mrs. Smith , deference towards an African @-@ American servant almost unheard of at that time . They do so in surviving letters , warmly , asking Stevens to see that she comes with him next time he visits . 
 As evidence that their relationship was sexual , Brodie pointed to an 1868 letter in which Stevens compares himself to Richard M. Johnson , vice president under Martin Van Buren , who lived openly with a series of African @-@ American slave mistresses . Johnson was elected even though this became known during the 1836 campaign , a fact that Stevens notes , and expresses his bitterness about his inability to gain election by the legislature to the Senate , or to secure a Cabinet position . 
 When Stevens died , Smith was at his bedside , along with his friend Simon Stevens , nephew Thaddeus Stevens Jr . , two African @-@ American nuns , and several other individuals . Under Stevens ' will , Smith was allowed to choose between a lump sum of $ 5 @,@ 000 or a $ 500 annual allowance ; she was also allowed to take any furniture in his house . With the inheritance , she purchased Stevens ' house , where she had lived for many years . A Roman Catholic , she chose to be buried in a Catholic cemetery , not near Stevens , although she left money for the upkeep of his grave . 
 Stevens had taken custody of his two young nephews , Thaddeus ( often called " Thaddeus Jr . " ) and Alanson Joshua Stevens after their parents died in Vermont . Alanson was sent to work at Stevens 's business , Caledonia Forge , Thaddeus Jr. was expelled from Dartmouth , though he subsequently graduated and was taken into his uncle 's law practice . Alanson during the Civil War rose to be commanding captain of a Pennsylvania Volunteers field artillery unit and was killed in action at Chickamauga . After Alanson 's death , his uncle used his influence to have Thaddeus Jr. made provost marshal of Lancaster .

 Buildings associated with Stevens and with Smith in Lancaster are being renovated by the local historical society , <unk> In his will , Stevens made a number of bequests , with much of his estate to his nephew Thaddeus Jr . , on condition that he refrain from alcohol . If he did not , that bequest would go to establish an orphanage in Lancaster , to be open to all races and nationalities without discrimination . A legal fight over his estate ensued , and it was not until 1894 that the courts settled the matter , awarding $ 50 @,@ 000 to found the orphanage . The school today is the Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology , in Lancaster . 
 Among a number of other schools named for Stevens , the Thaddeus Stevens Elementary School in Washington , D.C. was founded in 1868 as the first school built for African @-@ American children there . It was segregated for the first 86 years of its existence . In 1977 , Amy Carter , daughter of President Jimmy Carter , a Georgian , was enrolled there , the first child of a sitting president to attend public school in almost 70 years . 
 = = Historical and popular view = = 
 As Stevens biographer Richard N. Current put it , " to find out what really made the man go , the historian would need the combined aid of two experts from outside the profession — a psychoanalyst and a spiritualist . " The historical view of Thaddeus Stevens has fluctuated widely in the near century and a half since his death , generally in a manner inverse to that of Andrew Johnson . Early biographical works on Stevens were composed by men who knew him , and reflected their prejudices . Biographies at the turn of the century , such as that by Samuel McCall in 1899 and James Albert Woodburn in 1913 , presented Stevens favorably , as a sincere man , motivated by principle . Early African @-@ American historian W. E. B. Du Bois called Stevens " a leader of the common people " and " a stern believer in democracy , both in politics and in industry " . Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning historian James Ford Rhodes opined that though Stevens had a " profound sympathy " towards the African @-@ American , " coming straight from the heart " , he also showed " virulence toward the South " and was " bitter and vindictive " . This view of a vengeful Stevens originated during Reconstruction , and persisted well into the 20th century . 
 With the advent of the Dunning School 's view of Reconstruction after 1900 , Stevens continued to be viewed negatively , and generally as motivated by hatred . These historians , led by William Dunning , taught that Reconstruction had been an opportunity for radical politicians , motivated by ill @-@ will towards the South , to destroy what little of southern life and dignity the war had left . Dunning himself deemed Stevens " truculent , vindictive , and cynical " . Lloyd Paul Stryker , who wrote a highly favorable 1929 biography of Johnson , labeled Stevens as a " horrible old man ... craftily preparing to strangle the bleeding , broken body of the South " and who thought it would be " a beautiful thing " to see " the white men , especially the white women of the South , writhing under negro domination " . In 1915 , D. W. Griffith 's film The Birth of a Nation was released , containing the villainous character , Congressman Austin Stoneman , who resembled Stevens down to the ill @-@ fitting wig , limp , and African @-@ American lover ( named Lydia Brown ) . This popular treatment reinforced and reinvigorated public prejudices towards Stevens . According to Foner , " as historians exalted the magnanimity of Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , Stevens came to symbolize Northern malice , revenge , and irrational hatred of the South . " The highly popular historian James Truslow Adams described Stevens as " perhaps the most despicable , malevolent , and morally deformed character who has ever risen to high power in America . " 
 Historians who penned biographies of Stevens in the late 1930s sought to move away from this perspective , seeking to rehabilitate him and his political career . Thomas F. Woodley wrote of Stevens in 1937 , and while his work shows admiration of Stevens , he attributed Stevens 's driving force to bitterness over his clubfoot . Alphonse Miller , in his 1939 biography , found that the former congressman was motivated by a desire for justice . Both men were convinced that recent books had not treated him fairly . Richard Current 's 1942 work reflected current <unk> historiography which saw all American history , including Reconstruction , as a three @-@ way economic struggle between the industrialists of the Northeast ( represented by Stevens ) , the planters of the South and the farmers of the Midwest . Current argued that Stevens was motivated in his Reconstruction policies by frustrated ambitions , and a desire to use his political position to promote industrial capitalism and advance the Republican Party . He concluded that despite Stevens 's egalitarian beliefs he actually promoted inequality , for " none had done more than he to bring on the age of Big Business , with its concentration of wealth " . 
 With Ralph Korngold 's 1955 biography of Stevens , the <unk> school of historians began to consider the former congressman . These professors rejected the earlier view that those who had gone South to aid the African @-@ American after the war were " <unk> carpetbaggers " defeated by " saintly <unk> " . Instead , they applauded those who had sought to end slavery and forward civil rights , and castigated Johnson for obstructionism . They took the view that the African @-@ American was central to Reconstruction , and the only things wrong with the congressional program were that it did not go far enough , and stopped too soon . Brodie 's 1959 biography of Stevens was of this school . Controversial in its conclusions for being a psychobiography , it found that Stevens was a " consummate underdog who identified with the oppressed " , and whose intelligence won him success , while his consciousness of his clubfoot retarded his social development . According to Brodie , this also made him unwilling to marry a woman of his own social standing . 
 Scholars who followed Brodie continued to chip away at the idea of Stevens as a vindictive dictator , who dominated Congress to get his way . In 1960 , Eric McKitrick deemed Stevens " a picturesque and adroit politician , but a very limited one " whose career was " a long comic sequence of devilish schemes which , one after another , kept blowing up in his face " . From the mid @-@ 1970s onward , Foner argued that Stevens 's role was in staking out radical position , but events , not Stevens , caused the Republicans to support him . Michael Les Benedict in 1974 suggested that Stevens 's reputation as a dictator was based more on his personality than on his influence . In 1989 , Allan Bogue found that as chairman of Ways and Means , Stevens was " less than complete master " of his committee . 
 Historian Hans Trefousse stated in a 1969 study of the Radical Republicans that Stevens 's " one abiding passion was equality " . In 1991 , he noted that Stevens " was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in Congress . [ He dominated ] the House with his wit , knowledge of parliamentary law , and sheer willpower , even though he was often unable to prevail . " In his 1997 biography of Stevens , though , he took a position similar to McKitrick 's : that Stevens was a relatively marginal figure , with his influence often limited by his extremism . Trefousse believed that Brodie went too far both in deeming Stevens 's clubfoot responsible for so much about him , and in giving full credence to the Stevens @-@ Smith relationship : both those things cannot now be determined with certainty . 
 Steven Spielberg 's 2012 film Lincoln , in which Stevens was played by Tommy Lee Jones , brought new public interest in Stevens . Jones 's character is portrayed as the central figure among the radicals , responsible in large part for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment . Historian Matthew <unk> notes that Stevens is referred to only four times in Doris Kearns Goodwin 's Team of Rivals on which scriptwriter Tony Kushner based the film 's screenplay ; other radicals were folded into the character . Stevens is depicted as unable to moderate his views for the sake of gaining passage of the amendment until after he is urged to do so by the ever @-@ compromising Lincoln . According to Aaron <unk> in his article about the film and how it portrays the radicals , " he 's the uncle everyone is embarrassed of , even if they love him too much to say so . He 's not a leader , he 's a liability , one whose shining heroic moment will be when he keeps silent about what he really believes . " The film depicts a Stevens – Smith sexual relationship ; <unk> comments that " it may well have been true that they were lovers , but by injecting this issue into the movie , the filmmakers risk leaving the impression for some viewers that the ' secret ' reason for Stevens 's egalitarianism was his desire to legitimize his romance across racial lines .

 Oslo Commuter Rail ( Norwegian : NSB Lokaltog <unk> ) is a commuter rail centered in Oslo , Norway , connecting the capital to six counties in Eastern Norway . The system is operated by the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) and its subsidiary NSB Gjøvikbanen , using Class 69 and Class 72 electric multiple units ( EMU ) . The network spans eight routes and 128 stations , with Oslo Central Station ( Oslo S ) as the central hub . The trains run on 553 kilometers ( 344 mi ) of electrified mainline railway owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration . Deficits are financed by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications , although the network also has a ticketing cooperation with Ruter , the public transport authority in Oslo and Akershus . The network is the longest commuter rail network in the Nordic countries , and among top ten in Europe . 
 The commuter rail operates mainly within Greater Oslo and two of the lines only provide services within the urban area . Six of the lines span beyond the urban area , reaching the counties of Østfold , Hedmark , Oppland and Buskerud . The system is also an airport rail link to Oslo Airport , Gardermoen . West of Oslo , the system uses the Drammen , Asker , Spikkestad and Sørland lines , north of Oslo it uses the Gjøvik Line , east of Oslo it uses the Trunk , Gardermoen and Kongsvinger lines and south of Oslo it follows the Østfold and Eastern Østfold lines . 
 The system 's predecessors date back to the opening of the Trunk Line in 1854 . By 1902 , all the routes used by the present commuter rail had been taken into service . Electrification started in 1922 , and Class 62 EMUs were introduced in 1931 , followed by Class 65 units in 1936 and Class 67 in 1953 . Electrification was completed in 1963 . In 1980 , the Drammen Line was connected to the rest of the system and all trains started operating to the new Oslo S. The high @-@ speed Gardermoen Line opened in 1998 . In 2013 , new Stadler FLIRT units were taken into traffic , and the Asker Line was completed just before . By 2018 , the Follo Line is scheduled to open . 
 = = Network = = 
 The Oslo Commuter Rail runs entirely on mainline railways owned and maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration . The commuter rail uses ten lines , utilizing a line length of 553 kilometers ( 344 mi ) . The lines are all electrified at 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC and consists of 128 stations . The Asker , Drammen , Gardermoen and Østfold lines , and part of the Trunk Line , have double track , accounting for 204 kilometers ( 127 mi ) , while the rest of the network has single track . 
 Oslo S is the central hub of the commuter rail . Located in the central business district of Oslo , all lines either terminate at , or run through the station . From Oslo S , there are four main corridors . All trains running through the West Corridor continue along either the North , South or East Corridor . Because there are more services in the latter three , some of these terminate at Oslo S. 
 = = = West = = = 
 Along the West Corridor , the Drammen Line runs straight into the Oslo Tunnel , which starts directly beneath Oslo S. Trains run through Nationaltheatret , Norway 's second @-@ largest station , while in the tunnel . Just after surfacing , trains halt at Skøyen . Four of the routes see their trains terminate at Skøyen , while the remaining four continue onwards to Lysaker . After Lysaker , Line 400 continues stopping at all nine stations serving suburbs in Bærum and Asker , before reaching Asker Station , which serves as the terminus for most Line 400 services . For Line 400 , Asker is 35 minutes and 24 kilometers ( 15 mi ) from Oslo S. 
 Lines 440 , 450 and 550 only call at Sandvika before Asker , and use the Asker Line between the two stations . After Asker Station , Line 550 branches off along the Spikkestad Line and calls at seven stations in Asker and <unk> before terminating at Spikkestad Station . Spikkestad is 44 minutes and 37 kilometers ( 23 mi ) from Oslo S. Lines 440 and 450 , and some Line 400 trains , continue through the Lieråsen Tunnel and make two more stops before reaching Drammen . Drammen is 39 minutes and 42 kilometers ( 26 mi ) from Oslo S. Only Line 450 continues , along the Sørland Line , calling at seven stops in <unk> and Kongsberg before terminating at Kongsberg Station . Kongsberg is 1 hour and 20 minutes , and 89 kilometers ( 55 mi ) from Oslo S. 
 = = = East = = = 
 Along the East Corridor , Line 400 follows the Trunk Line and makes eleven stops serving suburban areas in Oslo , Lørenskog and Skedsmo before reaching Lillestrøm Station , where the line terminates . For Line 400 , Lillestrøm is located 29 minutes and 21 kilometres ( 13 mi ) from Oslo S. Lines 440 , 450 and 460 use the Gardermoen Line and the Romerike Tunnel to run directly to Lillestrøm . From there , lines 440 and 450 run along the Trunk Line , making four and two stops , respectively . After Kløfta Station , Line 440 continues along the Trunk Line , making three more stops until terminating at Dal Station . Dal is 34 minutes and 57 kilometers ( 35 mi ) from Oslo S. Line 450 switches to the Gardermoen Line , and calls at Oslo Airport Station and Eidsvoll Verk Station before terminating at Eidsvoll Station . Eidsvoll is 51 minutes and 64 kilometers ( 40 mi ) from Oslo S. Line 460 branches from Lillestrøm and operates along the Kongsvinger Line . It calls at eleven stations and enters Hedmark before Årnes Station , where most trains terminate . Årnes is 53 minutes and 58 kilometers ( 36 mi ) from Oslo S. A limited number of trains make express services to Årnes , then call at up to five more stations before reaching Kongsvinger Station , which is 1 hour and 10 minutes , and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) from Oslo S. Several of these Kongsvinger trains are actually Swedish inter @-@ city trains to Karlstad and two per day to Stockholm . These trains act like local trains in Norway and get financial support for that , needed to make them profitable .

 Along the South Corridor , three lines follow the Østfold Line . Line 500 makes 12 stops before terminating at Ski Station , which is 31 minutes and 24 kilometers ( 15 mi ) from Oslo S. Line 550 and 560 make only one stop each , at Kolbotn and <unk> , respectively , before Ski . Southwards , Line 550 follows the Western Østfold Line with four intermediate stops before Moss , which is 49 minutes and 60 kilometers ( 37 mi ) from Oslo S. Line 560 runs along the Eastern Østfold Line with 11 intermediate stops before Mysen Station , which is 1 hour and 5 minutes and 63 kilometers ( 39 mi ) from Oslo S. A limited number of services continue with two more stops before terminating at Rakkestad Station , which is 1 hour and 21 minutes , and 68 kilometers ( 42 mi ) from Oslo S.

 North of Oslo , NSB Gjøvikbanen operates along the Gjøvik Line . Trains operate either to Hakadal Station , Jaren Station or Gjøvik Station . The line is the only one to enter Oppland and calls at 23 stations north of Oslo S. Hakadal is 43 minutes and 32 kilometers ( 20 mi ) from Oslo S , while Jaren is 1 hour and 25 minutes , and 72 kilometers ( 45 mi ) from Oslo S. Gjøvik is the station furthest from Oslo , located 123 kilometers ( 76 mi ) and 1 hour and 55 minutes away . 
 From December 2012 , only the stretch between Oslo and Jaren are considered part of the commuter rail network , with 1 @-@ 2 local trains per hour per direction . Additionally , regional trains go to Gjøvik once per two hours , skipping 7 of the 11 stops closest to Oslo . 
 = = Service = = 
 Seven of the lines are operated by the Norwegian State Railways , owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications , while the Gjøvik Line is operated by the NSB @-@ owned NSB Gjøvikbanen . The operating deficit is covered by the state for NSB 's lines , while NSB Gjøvikbanen 's routes are financed by a public service obligation . The trains have two sections , manned and unmanned . <unk> ticket @-@ holders can travel in the unmanned section , which have orange doors . Manned sections , with gray doors , have a conductor and allow passengers to purchase tickets . Tickets are available at ticket machines at stations ; if bought inboard , there is a 20 Norwegian krone ( NOK ) surcharge . 
 Two of the lines , 400 and 500 , are designated as providing inner services . These operate along the Drammen Line to Asker , along the Trunk Line to Lillestrøm and the Østfold Line to Ski , stopping at all stations . The six other line , which make up the outer services , only make occasional stops on these sections . The inner services operate with a normal headway of 30 minutes , with 15 minutes offered in one direction during rush hour . In late evening and parts of the weekend , this is further reduced to 60 minutes . NSB 's outer routes operate with a normal headway of 60 minutes , with rush @-@ hour services offered at 30 @-@ minute intervals and late evening service provided every 120 minutes . Services between Årnes and Kongsvinger is limited to five daily services , and from Mysen to Rakkestad with four daily services . The Gjøvik Line runs with a 40 @-@ minute headway , with three different stopping patterns . One calls at all stations until Hakadal , one calls at most stations until Jaren , while one is an express service that runs the line 's full length to Gjøvik . 
 Within Oslo and Akershus , NSB has an agreement with the public transport authority Ruter to use their fares and ticketing system to ease transfer between the commuter rail and other forms of public transport . Ruter makes use of a zone system , including a single @-@ zone fare within Oslo . From 2010 , the contactless ticket system <unk> is being introduced . In Oslo , there is transfer to the Oslo Metro at Oslo S ( to Jernbanetorget ) , at Nationaltheatret and at Grefsen ( to Storo ) . Transfer to the Oslo Tramway is possible from Oslo S , Nationaltheatret , Skøyen and Grefsen . At Moss , there is transfer to the Moss – Horten Ferry . Line 450 provides connection to Norway 's main international airport , Oslo Airport , Gardermoen .

Each car is 24 @.@ 85 meters ( 81 @.@ 5 ft ) long , with motor cars weighing 64 @.@ 0 to 53 @.@ 9 tonnes ( 63 @.@ 0 to 53 @.@ 0 long tons ; 70 @.@ 5 to 59 @.@ 4 short tons ) and end cars weighing down to 28 @.@ 8 tonnes ( 28 @.@ 3 long tons ; 31 @.@ 7 short tons ) . Typical seating capacity is 96 passengers in the motor cars and 112 passengers in the end cars . The class was delivered in four versions , named A through D. After the initial delivery of fifteen <unk> in 1970 and 1971 , twenty <unk> were delivered in 1974 and 1975 . These were designed to operate on longer sections and were equipped with only one door per car . This turned out to extend stopping time too much , and the C and D versions were delivered with two doors per car . From 1975 to 1977 , NSB took delivery of fourteen <unk> and from 1983 to 1993 thirty @-@ nine <unk> . The latter is distinguishable because of its different front . NSB operates both two- and three @-@ car sets , and up to three units can be run in multiple , allowing NSB to operate any train length from two to nine cars . Eighty @-@ two units remain in service , although some of those are used on the Bergen Commuter Rail and the Arendal Line . 
 NSB Class 72 is a series of 36 four @-@ car electric multiple units built by AnsaldoBreda . The units are permanently coupled together using Jacobs bogies . Each unit has a power output of 2 @,@ 550 kilowatts ( 3 @,@ 420 hp ) , allowing a top speed of 160 kilometers per hour ( 99 mph ) . The trains are 85 @.@ 57 metres ( 280 @.@ 7 ft ) long and weigh 156 tonnes ( 154 long tons ; 172 short tons ) , and have seating for 310 passengers and one toilet . The trains have better accessibility than Class 69 and unlike their predecessors are equipped with an electronic public information system . Some of the 36 units are used on the Jæren Commuter Rail . 
 42 new electric multiple units called Class 75 were delivered 2013 @-@ 2015 . Similar units called Class 74 adopted for regional rail were delivered in 2012 @-@ 2013 .

 NSB Class 62 was a series of four multiple units built in 1931 and 1933 by Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri ( NEBB ) . The units had a power output of 344 kilowatts ( 461 hp ) , giving a top speed of 70 kilometers per hour ( 43 mph ) . The motor cars were built in wood , were 20 @.@ 60 meters ( 67 @.@ 6 ft ) long , weighed 43 @.@ 2 tonnes ( 42 @.@ 5 long tons ; 47 @.@ 6 short tons ) and seated 73 passengers . They ran mostly on the Drammen Line and were in service around Oslo from 1931 to 1953 . 
 NSB Class 65 and NSB Class 67 were two similar series of electric multiple units , all built by Skabo and NEBB . Class 65 was delivered in three versions , named A through C. Class A and B were rebuilt passenger wagons . <unk> units of Class <unk> were built from 1936 to 1939 and had a wooden body . Thirteen units of Class <unk> were delivered in 1941 and 1942 and was built with a steel frame . They were 22 centimeters ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) longer than the A @-@ series . Twenty @-@ two Class <unk> units were built from 1949 to 1952 . From 1949 to 1950 , 17 middle and end cars were delivered for the Class 65 units . Class 67 was a series of 18 units built from 1953 to 1955 . They had a slightly more advanced technological system , but were otherwise often run mixed with Class 65 units . The Class 65 motor cars had a power output of 464 kilowatts ( 622 hp ) and a top speed of 70 kilometers per hour ( 43 mph ) . They were 20 @.@ 70 meters ( 67 @.@ 9 ft ) long , weighed 42 @.@ 5 to 46 @.@ 6 tonnes ( 41 @.@ 8 to 45 @.@ 9 long tons ; 46 @.@ 8 to 51 @.@ 4 short tons ) and had a seating capacity for 66 passengers . Class 65 remained in service until 1993 and Class 67 until 1995 . 
 Many NSB Class 69 units were taken out from traffic in 2013 @-@ 2015 , replaced by Class 75 units . 
 = = History = = 
 The first part of what is now the Oslo Commuter Rail was the Trunk Line , which opened on 1 September 1854 between Oslo East Station ( Oslo Ø , located at the same place as the current Oslo S ) , and Eidsvoll . The line was at first private , although it was nationalized in 1926 . On 3 October 1862 , the Kongsvinger Line opened from Lillestrøm to Kongsvinger . The Østfold Line opened from Oslo Ø to Moss and onwards to Halden on 2 January 1879 , followed by the Eastern Østfold Line from Ski via Mysen to Sarpsborg on 24 November 1882 . 
 West of Oslo , the first part of the current commuter rail was the Randsfjord Line ( parts of which have since become part of the Sørland Line ) , which opened on 15 November 1866 between Drammen and Vikersund . The Sørland Line from <unk> to Kongsberg opened on 10 November 1871 and connected to the Randsfjord Line . On 7 October 1872 , the Drammen Line opened from Oslo West Station ( Oslo V ) to Drammen . This line , along with the section from Drammen to Kongsberg , were built with 1 @,@ 067 mm ( 3 ft 6 in ) narrow gauge and did not connect to the main station of Oslo Ø . The Gjøvik Line opened from Grefsen to Jaren on 20 December 1900 , and from Oslo Ø to Grefsen and from Jaren to Gjøvik on 28 November 1902 . 
 In 1903 and 1904 , the Trunk Line was upgraded to double track . The section from Drammen to Kongsberg was converted to standard gauge on 1 November 1909 . Between 1917 and 1920 , dual gauge was laid between Oslo V and Drammen , and from 13 November 1922 , the Drammen Line was entirely operated with standard gauge . The first electrification of NSB 's lines was put into service on 26 October 1922 on the Drammen Line between Oslo V and Brakerøya . The section from Oslo V to Sandvika was upgraded to double track on 26 November 1922 . From 1922 , NSB introduced El 1 @-@ hauled passenger trains on the Drammen Line , and later other lines . 
 The next electrification occurred on the Trunk Line from Oslo Ø to Lillestrøm on 1 September 1927 , the Randsfjord Line from Drammen to Kongsberg on 10 April 1929 and the Drammen Line from Drammen to Brakerøya on 6 May 1930 . El 5 locomotives were acquired for the Trunk Line . Electric multiple units were put into service in 1931 , with the delivery of four Class 62 units on the route from Oslo V to Sandvika . These proved not to be sufficiently powerful for the large traffic and were later moved to less used services from Oslo V to Asker or <unk> . The class remained on the commuter rail service until 1953 . 
 From 1936 , NSB took delivery of Class 65 multiple units , replacing El 1 as the primary hauler on the electrified commuter rail network . Class 65 were the first that were optimized for local traffic , with wide doors and turnable seats . NSB took delivery of 49 units until 1952 , although they were also used outside the commuter rail network . The Østfold Line was upgraded to double track and put into service in four sections : from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924 , from Oslo Ø to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929 , from Ljan to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and from Kolbotn to Ski on 14 May 1939 . The Østfold Line was also the next line to be electrified , which opened in sections between 1936 and 1940 . NSB took into use El 8 locomotives on the line . 
 On 15 June 1953 , the Trunk Line from Lillestrøm to Eidsvoll took electrification into use . Further upgrades on the Drammen Line installing double track were put into service on 24 July 1953 from Billingstad to Hvalstad , on 29 November 1955 from Hvalstad to Asker and on 9 November 1958 from Sandvika to Billingstad . Between 1953 and 1955 , NSB took delivery of 18 Class 67 multiple units . While visually similar to Class 65 , they had improved technology and reliability . On 1 February 1961 , the Gjøvik Line from Oslo Ø to Tøyen was put into service with double track and the line from Oslo Ø to Jaren put into service as electrified . Double track from Tøyen to Grefsen opened on 27 May 1962 and the sections from Jaren to Gjøvik was electrified in 1963 . 
 In the 1960s , NSB found the need for a new generation of trains . Class 69 was built in aluminum and were longer , allowing for more passengers per car . They had a maximum speed of 130 kilometres per hour ( 81 mph ) ; this had a significant cost impact , as it allowed not only faster travel time , but allowed the services from Oslo Ø to Lillestrøm and Ski to run fast enough to dispense with one third of the previous number of units . Combined with the increased size , NSB could replace three three @-@ car trains with two two @-@ car trains . At the same time , some smaller stops were terminated to allow faster travel time . Eighty @-@ eight units were delivered in four series between 1970 and 1993 , with later series having a three @-@ car configuration . On 3 June 1973 , the 10 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometer ( 6 @.@ 6 mi ) long Lieråsen Tunnel opened , shortening the Drammen Line by 11 @.@ 7 kilometers ( 7 @.@ 3 mi ) . The 13 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometer ( 8 @.@ 5 mi ) long section from Asker to Spikkestad was kept as a branch line , and named the Spikkestad Line , while the section from Spikkestad to Brakerøya was removed . 
 The Oslo Tunnel opened on 30 May 1980 , connecting the Drammen Line to Oslo Ø . Initially , only the Lillestrøm – Drammen / Spikkestad lines used the tunnel , in addition to some services from Eidsvoll and Årnes to Skøyen . At the same time , Oslo Ø was rebuilt to the 19 @-@ platform Oslo S , which was put into service on 26 November 1986 . Oslo V was closed on 27 May 1989 . 
 In 1993 , NSB received a large delivery of middle cars for the majority of the Class 69 units , allowing NSB to operate them as three @-@ car trains . Between 1992 and 1996 , a new , upgraded double track was put into service between Ski and Moss . The section is capable of speeds from 160 to 200 kilometres per hour ( 99 to 124 mph ) . The Gardermoen Line opened as Norway 's first high @-@ speed line on 8 October 1998 . The line runs parallel to the Trunk Line from Oslo S to Eidsvoll , via Oslo Airport , Gardermoen — which opened the same day . The section from Oslo S to Lillestrøm , consisting mainly of the Romerike Tunnel , was delayed because of leaks in the tunnel , and opened on 22 August 1999 . In 1997 , NSB ordered 36 Class 72 multiple units to supplement and replace existing material . They were pained green and branded as part of the NSB Puls scheme , which was quickly abandoned . The four @-@ car units were taken into service in 2002 . 
 The ministry decided in the early 2000s to make the services on the Gjøvik Line subject to public service obligations , as a trial to privatize operation of all passenger train services in Norway . In the tender , NSB 's subsidiary , NSB Anbud ( since renamed NSB Gjøvikbanen ) won the ten @-@ year contract , after having underbid Veolia Transport Norge and DSB . Nine Class 69 trains were upgraded and designated <unk> and will operate until 2015 on the Gjøvik Line . Because of a cabinet change in 2005 , the PSO contracting was terminated . On 27 August 2005 , the Asker Line opened between Sandvika and Asker , allowing trains to bypass the many local stations at 160 kilometres per hour ( 99 mph ) . 
 In 2011 , the Asker Line from Lysaker to Sandvika , and a new Lysaker Station opened . This increased the capacity and regularity along the Drammen Line . The opening of four tracks at Lysaker will allow NSB to run all local trains that previously have run to Skøyen all the way to Lysaker . The closed Høvik Station will be used to turn trains . The Oslo Tunnel remains the bottleneck west of Oslo , so no more trains can run westwards , although more will be able to continue past Skøyen . 
 In 2008 , NSB ordered 50 Stadler FLIRT multiple units , to be designated Class 74 and 75 , and later 16 more Class 75 . 42 of these , class 75 , have a commuter train configuration . NSB holds an option for an additional 84 units . The trains have a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour ( 120 mph ) and a faster acceleration than the older classes . The combination of the Asker Line and more rolling stock allows NSB to operate a more aggressive service after a major restructuring of the lines in 2012 . In particular , there are between five and seven @-@ minute headway on the sections between Asker and Lillestrøm , and a twenty @-@ minute headway to Oslo Airport and Eidsvoll . 
 = = Future = = 
 The next larger railway construction around Oslo is scheduled to be the Follo Line , which will connect Oslo Central Station directly with Ski . The 22 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometer ( 14 @.@ 0 mi ) long line is planned to be built nearly entirely in a single tunnel and will allow speeds at 200 kilometers per hour ( 120 mph ) . It will allow higher speeds and capacity southwards for the lines to Moss and Rakkestad , as well as regional trains to Østfold and Sweden . The line is scheduled for completion in 2018 . Parliament has passed the Ringerike Line , which would run from Sandvika to Hønefoss Station on the Bergen Line . While mainly proposed as a shortening of the Bergen Line , the line would double up as a commuter train line , allowing Hønefoss and Ringerike significantly faster public transport to the capital area . The line would be 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) long and allow speeds of 200 kilometers per hour ( 120 mph ) . However , no financing has been secured for the project . 
 = Action of 19 February 1801 = 
 The Action of 19 February 1801 was a minor naval battle fought off Ceuta in Spanish North Africa in February 1801 between frigates of the French and Royal Navies during the French Revolutionary Wars . The engagement formed part of a series of actions fought to prevent the French from resupplying their garrison in Egypt , which had been trapped there without significant reinforcement since the defeat of the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of the Nile two and a half years earlier . The leader of the Egyptian expedition , General Napoleon Bonaparte , had returned to France in 1799 and promised aid to the troops left behind , prompting several expeditions to the region carrying reinforcements . 
 The frigate Africaine had been sent from Rochefort early in 1801 with more than 400 soldiers for the Egyptian garrison , and by February had reached the Mediterranean Sea , Commodore Saulnier seeking to pass along the North African coast to avoid patrolling Royal Navy warships . On the afternoon of 19 February however the overladen French warship was discovered by the British HMS Phoebe and rapidly chased down and brought to action . In an engagement lasting two hours , the French ship was reduced to a wallowing wreck as broadsides from Phoebe tore through the hull , rigging and the soldiers packed on the decks : by the time Africaine surrendered , 200 men were dead and another 143 wounded . The captured ship was brought into the base at Port Mahon in Minorca and subsequently served in the Royal Navy . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1798 a large French expeditionary force under General Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt , then under the nominal control of the Ottoman Empire , in an extension of the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars . The fleet that had convoyed the French army was anchored in Aboukir Bay near Alexandria , and was discovered there by a British fleet under Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson on 1 August . In the ensuing Battle of the Nile the French Mediterranean Fleet was almost totally destroyed , preventing the French forces in Egypt from maintaining regular reinforcement and communication from France and ending the possibility of a wholesale evacuation of the French army . Following an unsuccessful campaign in Syria , Bonaparte returned to France without his army , eventually seizing control of the French government during the events of 18 Brumaire . 
 By 1801 , the troops in Egypt were in an increasingly desperate situation : supplies were low , reinforcement from France almost non @-@ existent and disease was rife . In addition they were subject to constant attack by Ottoman and irregular Egyptian forces , culminating in the assassination of General Jean Baptiste Kléber . Bonaparte , conscious of his promises to send reinforcements to the beleaguered army in Egypt , planned a series of expeditions to the region to restore morale and numbers to the expeditionary force , drawn from troops and naval units available on the French Atlantic coast . The largest force consisted of 5 @,@ 000 soldiers and nine ships under Rear @-@ Admiral Honoré Ganteaume and sailed from Brest in January 1801 , but this squadron had been preceded by two frigates from Rochefort , Africaine and Régénérée . 
 Each of the frigates carried , in addition to their regular complement , approximately 400 soldiers and large quantities of muskets , cannon and ammunition to reinforce the Egyptian garrison . The ships had an uneventful passage southwards , separating before entering the Mediterranean and taking different routes towards Egypt . Africaine , under the command of Commodore Saulnier who had previously fought at the Nile and in the Action of 31 March 1800 as captain of the ship of the line Guillaume Tell , had elected to travel along the North African coast to avoid British patrols in open waters , and by 19 February was passing the Spanish North African town of Ceuta , 6 nautical miles ( 11 km ) east of Gibraltar . Africaine was a large modern 40 @-@ gun frigate with 715 men aboard but the huge quantity of supplies made the vessel slow and unresponsive and vulnerable to attack by a more agile opponent . Also sailing off Ceuta on the afternoon of 19 February was the 36 @-@ gun British frigate HMS Phoebe under the command of Captain Robert Barlow . Phoebe , carrying 239 men aboard ( 22 below the required complement ) , was operating from the British base at Port Mahon on Minorca on a routine patrol between there and Gibraltar , and had just passed Ceuta to the south on the last leg of the journey when at 16 : 00 the lookout sighted Africaine . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Barlow immediately turned to investigate the strange sail , steering southwards directly at the lumbering vessel . Saulnier was seemingly unwilling to attempt any manoeuvere in the face of the enemy , as Africaine continued to hold the original course without deviation . By 19 : 30 it was inevitable that Phoebe would intercept Africaine and Saulnier shortened sail , slowing his frigate to meet the threat . Barlow was still unsure of the identity of the stranger and fired a shot over Africaine as a warning to its captain to identify his ship . Saulnier responded by turning to port and firing a broadside directly at Phoebe . It was poorly aimed however and mostly scattered into the sea without effect . At this , Barlow pulled Phoebe into a parallel position to Africaine and unleashed a much more devastating broadside from close range . The two frigates then began an exchange of fire at close range . 
 The effect of Phoebe 's broadsides on the overladen French frigate were disastrous : for two hours Africaine limped northwards with Phoebe pouring fire into the French ship without significant reply . Even as they were cut down by cannon fire , French soldiers continued to climb out of the hold and join the combat on deck , their musketry useless at the range between the ships and the press of bodies obstructing the French sailors from working their guns effectively . Saulnier was killed , Général de division Edme Desfourneaux badly wounded and many of their subordinates including all of the naval lieutenants , made casualties ; almost all of the rigging had been torn away , most of the guns smashed from their mounts and the decks literally heaped with dead bodies . Even the orlop , usually the safest part of a ship and therefore where the ships medical facilities were located , came under heavy fire and three surgeons were killed while standing at the operating table . Eventually the senior surviving officer , Captain Jean @-@ Jacques <unk> , who had suffered a severe head wound , authorised the colours to be struck at 21 : 30 , approximately 60 nautical miles ( 110 km ) east of Gibraltar , thereby surrendering the ship . Phoebe by contrast was only lightly damaged , with the principle injury being to the masts : both ships might have been dismasted had there been any strong wind rather than a deep calm during the evening . Only one man , Seaman Samuel Hayes , had been killed and just 12 wounded including the first lieutenant . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Barlow took possession of the battered French vessel and set his men to making hasty repairs before the weather could worsen . The first task was dealing with the dead and wounded on the French ship : <unk> reported in the immediate aftermath that 200 men had been killed and 143 were seriously wounded or dying , figures that Barlow considered to be understated . When repairs were complete , Barlow turned his ships towards nearby Gibraltar , but in the face of a westerly breeze progress was slow and after fours days he abandoned the attempt and turned back to Minorca , concerned for the state of the wounded men and the large number of prisoners of war aboard both vessels . However , the wind dropped when the ships were off the Southern coast of Majorca and Phoebe and Africaine did not reach Port Mahon until 5 March . The action was highly praised by the station commander Captain Manley Dixon , who stated in a letter to the Admiralty dated 10 March 1801 " that more Skill or effective Gunnery were never displayed in any Combat than in the present Instance " . 
 Barlow was subsequently knighted for his success , and moved from Phoebe to the frigate HMS Concorde , a highly desirable warship noted for its speed , before moving to the ship of the line HMS Triumph later in the year . His wounded first lieutenant , John Wentworth Holland , was promoted to commander and the other officers and the enlisted men were all highly praised in the official dispatch . Africaine was purchased by the Royal Navy and briefly renamed Amelia before reverting to Africaine . The ship had a long career in British service during the Napoleonic Wars , participating in numerous actions including the controversial Action of 13 September 1810 during the Mauritius campaign . Nearly five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by the clasp " <unk> 19 <unk> . 1801 " , attached to the Naval General Service Medal which was awarded upon application to all British participants from Phoebe still living in 1847 . Régénérée had an uninterrupted passage to Egypt , arriving on 1 March , one day before the British Expeditionary Force initiated a close blockade of the coast . Régénérée proved to be the only major French warship to reach the garrison after Ganteaume 's squadron was repeatedly driven back in its efforts . Without supplies and reinforcements the French army in Egypt could not effectively resist the major British invasion of the country in March 1801 and after a brief campaign was forced to capitulate at Alexandria in August . 
 Historical analysis of the battle has praised Barlow 's conduct : his tactics of refusing to allow the French ship to come alongside and board his vessel , thereby turning the French superiority in numbers into a disadvantage was commended by William James , and historian Tom Wareham has noted that the standing British practice of firing into enemy hulls rather than at the rigging as practiced by the French gave Barlow an advantage against the crowded decks of Africaine . Saulnier too has been praised for his efforts to avoid combat with his ship so overladen and for the subsequent valour with which his crew and their passengers fought so fiercely for two hours against mounting odds and in the face of " truly dreadful " casualties , although he was also subject to criticism in France when it emerged that he had removed the quoins from his guns in an effort to force his men to fire at the British rigging rather than the hull : Bonaparte ordered that in future his ships intended " not to dismast the enemy , but to do him as much harm as possible .

 = 1923 FA Cup Final = 
 The 1923 FA Cup Final was an association football match between Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United on 28 April 1923 at the original Wembley Stadium in London . The showpiece match of English football 's primary cup competition , the Football Association Challenge Cup ( better known as the FA Cup ) , it was the first football match to be played at Wembley Stadium . King George V was in attendance to present the trophy to the winning team . 
 Each team had progressed through five rounds to reach the final . Bolton Wanderers won 1 – 0 in every round from the third onwards , and David Jack scored the lone goal each time . West Ham United faced opposition from the Second Division or lower in each round , the first time this had occurred since the introduction of multiple divisions in the Football League . West Ham took three attempts to defeat Southampton in the fourth round but then easily defeated Derby County in the semi @-@ final , scoring five goals . 
 The final was preceded by chaotic scenes as vast crowds surged into the stadium , far exceeding its official capacity of approximately 125 @,@ 000 . A crowd estimated at up to 300 @,@ 000 gained entrance and the terraces overflowed , with the result that spectators found their way into the area around the pitch and even onto the playing area itself . Mounted policemen , including one on a light @-@ coloured horse which became the defining image of the day , had to be brought in to clear the crowds from the pitch and allow the match to take place . The match began 45 minutes late as crowds stood around the perimeter of the pitch . Although West Ham started strongly , Bolton proved the dominant team for most of the match and won 2 – 0 . David Jack scored a goal two minutes after the start of the match and Jack Smith added a controversial second goal during the second half . The pre @-@ match events prompted discussion in the House of Commons and led to the introduction of safety measures for future finals . The match is often referred to as the " White Horse Final " and is commemorated by the White Horse Bridge at the new Wembley Stadium . 
 = = Route to the final = = 
 Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United were playing in the First Division and Second Division respectively , and both entered the competition at the first round stage , under the tournament format in place at the time . Bolton had appeared in the final twice before , in 1894 and 1904 , but West Ham , who had only joined The Football League in 1919 , had never previously progressed further than the quarter finals . In the first round , Bolton defeated Norwich City of the Third Division South , in the process recording the club 's first away win in the competition since a second round victory over Manchester City in the 1904 – 05 season . After a home win over Leeds United in the second round , Bolton faced one of the First Division 's top teams , Huddersfield Town , in the third round . The initial match at Huddersfield 's Leeds Road ground ended in a draw , necessitating a replay which Bolton won 1 – 0 . In the fourth round Bolton defeated Charlton Athletic by a single goal , and in the semi @-@ final beat Sheffield United by the same score in a match played at Old Trafford , home of Manchester United . Although ticket prices were considered to be extremely high , a crowd of 72 @,@ 000 attended the match , a new record for an FA Cup semi @-@ final . In every match from the third round onwards , Bolton 's single goal was scored by David Jack , which gave him a reputation for having single @-@ handedly steered his team into the final . 
 In contrast to Bolton 's defensive style , West Ham 's cup run was characterised by fast @-@ moving , attacking play , which won them many admirers . The London @-@ based club began the competition away to fellow Second Division team Hull City and won 3 – 2 . In the second round they were held to a draw by Brighton & Hove Albion of the Third Division South , but won the replay 1 – 0 at home . The " Hammers " defeated another Third Division South team , Plymouth Argyle , in the third round , but found the fourth round tough going against Southampton . The first match at West Ham 's home , the Boleyn Ground , ended in a 1 – 1 draw , as did the replay at The Dell in Southampton . A second replay was held at Villa Park in Birmingham , home of Aston Villa , and finally produced a winner , as West Ham won 1 – 0 with a goal from Billy Brown . The goal came in the 70th minute , with a " clever free kick " past the " startled " Herbert Lock in the Saints ' goal . In the semi @-@ finals , West Ham took on Derby County at Stamford Bridge , home of Chelsea , and won 5 – 2 . Brown scored two more goals and Billy Moore also scored twice . All five of the teams that West Ham defeated on their way to Wembley played in the Second Division or lower . This made West Ham the first team since the introduction of multiple divisions in The Football League to reach the FA Cup final without facing opposition from the top division .

 The match was the first event of any kind to take place at Wembley Stadium , which had not been due to open until 1924 but was completed ahead of schedule . After sub @-@ capacity crowds had attended the first three finals after the First World War at Stamford Bridge , The Football Association ( The FA ) was unconvinced that the match could fill the large capacity of the new stadium and undertook a major advertising campaign , for fans to attend . Despite these fears , the new national stadium , which had been advertised as the greatest venue of its kind and had an unprecedented capacity of 125 @,@ 000 , proved to be a great lure and drew a large number of casual observers . The fact that a London @-@ based team was competing meant that many football fans from all parts of the city chose to attend . The morning newspapers on the day of the match reported that around 5 @,@ 000 fans were travelling from Bolton and that they were expected to be joined by " at least 115 @,@ 000 enthusiasts from London and other parts of the country " . The easy accessibility of the stadium by public transport and the fine weather were also factors which contributed to the enormous crowd . 
 The gates were opened at 11 : 30 am as advertised , three and a half hours before the match was due to begin , and until 1 : 00 pm the flow of people into the stadium was orderly . By 1 : 00 pm , however , a vast number of people were pouring into the stadium , and after an inspection by the stadium authorities , the decision was made to close the gates at 1 : 45 pm . Spectator William Rose said later that Olympic Way was " seething with people " and that " the nearer I got to the stadium the worse it got , by the time I got there the turnstiles had been closed " . Although the information was relayed to various railway stations , thousands of people continued to arrive and mass outside the gates . Organisation within the stadium was poor , and in his report on the match the correspondent for the Daily Mail described the stewarding as " useless " and stated that officials in and around the stadium " seemed to know nothing " . Fans were not directed to any specific area , and the tiers in the lower half of the stadium filled up much faster than those higher up . As the crowds outside the stadium continued to grow , local police stations were mobilised , but by the time officers arrived the crowd was too large for them to take any effective form of action . At 2 : 15 pm , the crowds outside the stadium rushed at the barriers and forced their way in . Spectators in the lower tiers had to climb the fences to escape the crush and overflowed onto the pitch itself . Spectator Terry Hickey said later that " To put it mildly , the whole thing was a bloody shambles " . The crowd was officially reported as 126 @,@ 047 , but estimates of the actual number of fans in attendance range from 150 @,@ 000 to over 300 @,@ 000 . The FA refunded 10 % of the total gate money to fans who had pre @-@ purchased tickets but were unable to reach their assigned seats . The roads around the stadium were blocked and the Bolton players were forced to abandon their coach a mile from the stadium and make their way through the crowds . The Times stated that at one point it seemed impossible that the match would ever be able to start , but that when King George V arrived , the mood of the crowd changed . After enthusiastically singing " God Save The King " , the crowd began to assist the authorities in clearing the playing area . 
 Eventually mounted policemen were brought in to try to clear the crowds from the pitch , including PC George Scorey , who was mounted on a horse named " Billie " ( some sources spell the name " Billy " ) . PC Scorey had not actually been on duty that day but answered a call for emergency assistance as the throng of spectators in the stadium grew . Billie the horse was actually grey , but appeared white in the primitive black and white newsreel footage of the era . Contrary to what is sometimes claimed , other horses were also involved , but the " white " horse , as the most visible in the news footage , became the defining image of the day . Officials later stated that the match would never have been able to start without the actions of PC Scorey . When asked about his actions in an interview with the BBC some years later , Scorey said : 
 As my horse picked his way onto the field , I saw nothing but a sea of heads . I thought , " We can 't do it . It 's impossible . " But I happened to see an opening near one of the goals and the horse was very good – easing them back with his nose and tail until we got a goal @-@ line cleared . I told them in front to join hands and heave and they went back step by step until we reached the line . Then they sat down and we went on like that ... it was mainly due to the horse . Perhaps because he was white he commanded more attention . But more than that , he seemed to understand what was required of him . The other helpful thing was the good nature of the crowd . 
 Eventually the police , assisted by appeals from the players for the crowd to calm , were able to manoeuvre the spectators to just beyond the touchline , and the game began approximately 45 minutes late , while fans stood around the perimeter of the pitch .

 Both teams employed the 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 5 formation typical of the era : two full @-@ backs , three half @-@ backs , comprising one centre @-@ half and two wing @-@ halves , and five forwards , comprising two outside @-@ forwards , two inside @-@ forwards and a centre @-@ forward . West Ham 's game plan initially centred on the two fast @-@ moving outside @-@ forwards Dick Richards and Jimmy <unk> , but Bolton set out from the start to keep the two players contained , rushing at them whenever they got the ball . After just two minutes West Ham half @-@ back Jack <unk> became entangled in the crowd after taking a throw @-@ in and was unable to return to the pitch immediately . This gave Bolton 's David Jack the opportunity to shoot for goal . His shot beat West Ham goalkeeper Ted <unk> to give Bolton the lead , and hit a spectator who was standing pressed against the goal net , knocking him unconscious . Three minutes later Vic Watson received the ball a few yards in front of the Bolton goal but his shot flew over the crossbar . Eleven minutes into the game the crowd surged forward once again and a large number of fans encroached onto the pitch , leading to the suspension of play while the mounted police again cleared the playing area . A number of fans required first aid from members of the British Red Cross while the players looked on and awaited the resumption of play . Policemen patrolled the perimeter of the pitch to keep it clear for the linesmen , after play was resumed . 
 Soon after play restarted , West Ham 's Dick Richards eluded two Bolton defenders and shot for goal . Bolton goalkeeper Dick Pym fumbled the ball but managed to kick it clear before it crossed the goal @-@ line . Bolton continued to dominate the match , and were only prevented from scoring again by a strong performance from West Ham full @-@ back Billy Henderson . When West Ham attacked , however , Bolton were able to quickly switch to a strongly defensive formation , as players changed positions to form a line of five half @-@ backs . This stifled West Ham 's attacking style of play and ensured that the Bolton goal was not seriously threatened , and the score remained 1 – 0 to Bolton until half @-@ time . Due to the crowds that surrounded the pitch , the players were unable to reach the dressing @-@ rooms and instead remained on the pitch for five minutes before starting the second half . 
 West Ham began the second half as the stronger team , and Vic Watson received the ball in a good goalscoring position but mis @-@ hit his shot . Eight minutes into the second half , Bolton added a second goal in controversial circumstances . Outside @-@ forward Ted Vizard played the ball into a central position and Jack Smith hit the ball past <unk> . West Ham 's players claimed that the ball had not entered the goal but rebounded into play from the goalpost , but referee D. H. Asson overruled them , stating that in his view the ball had entered the goal but then rebounded off a spectator . West Ham also claimed that Bolton had received an unfair advantage , as a Bolton fan at pitchside had kicked the ball towards Vizard , but Asson disregarded these claims as well and confirmed Bolton 's second goal . At this point the crowd began to sense that Bolton would emerge victorious and many began heading towards the exits . Neither team had any more serious chances to score , and the remainder of the match was largely a stalemate with little inspired play . Late in the game , West Ham captain George Kay attempted to persuade Asson to abandon the match , but Bolton captain Joe Smith reportedly replied " We 're doing fine , ref , we 'll play until dark to finish the match if necessary " . The score remained 2 – 0 to Bolton until the final whistle . The King presented the FA Cup trophy to Joe Smith and then left the stadium to cheers from the crowd . West Ham trainer Charlie Paynter attributed his team 's defeat to the damage the pitch had suffered before kick @-@ off , saying " It was that white horse thumping its big feet into the pitch that made it hopeless . Our wingers were tumbling all over the place , tripping up in great ruts and holes " .

 Although around 900 spectators were treated for slight injuries , only 22 were taken to hospital and ten of those were quickly discharged . Two policemen were also injured during the match . The chaotic scenes at the match prompted discussion in the House of Commons , where Home Secretary William Bridgeman paid tribute to the actions of the police and the general behaviour of the crowd . During the debate Oswald Mosley was chastised by the Speaker of the House for characterising the fans present at the stadium as hooligans . Bridgeman was asked to consider opening a public inquiry , but ultimately concluded that the police had dealt successfully with the incident , and that he was happy for the stadium authorities and the police to decide on a plan to prevent similar events from happening again . 
 A committee examined the stadium a month after the match , and made several recommendations to the stadium authorities . Their proposals included the replacement of the turnstiles with more up @-@ to @-@ date models , the erection of extra gates and railings , and the division of the terraces into self @-@ contained sections , each with its own entrance . In addition , the pre @-@ purchasing of tickets was made compulsory for all future finals , eliminating the possibility that excessive numbers of fans would arrive in the hope of being able to pay at the turnstile . The gross gate money for the match was £ 27 @,@ 776 . After the deduction of the stadium authorities ' costs , the Football Association and each of the two clubs took £ 6 @,@ 365 , although the refunds to fans unable to reach their assigned seats were deducted from the FA 's share . 
 After the match the players and officials attended a dinner at which former Prime Minister David Lloyd George proposed the toast . The Bolton players returned home by train and were greeted at Moses Gate railway station by the chairman of Farnworth District Council before going on to a reception hosted by the Mayor . The club presented each of the victorious players with a gold watch . The players from both teams received gold commemorative medals . In 2005 the medal presented to West Ham 's George Kay was sold at auction for £ 4 @,@ 560 , and tickets and programmes from the match have also been star lots at auctions .

 The image of Billie the white horse remains famous within English football lore , and the match is often referred to as " The White Horse Final " . Billie 's rider , George Scorey , was rewarded by the Football Association with free tickets to subsequent finals , but he had no interest in football and chose not to attend . 
 In 2005 , a public poll chose that the new footbridge near the rebuilt Wembley Stadium would be named the White Horse Bridge . The executive director of the London Development Agency , which organised the poll , stated that the choice of name was appropriate given that the bridge , like the horse , would improve safety for fans at Wembley . Scottish newspaper the Daily Record claimed that fans of the national team of Scotland had voted in large numbers so as to prevent a former England player or manager being honoured , and also because " White Horse " is also the name of a brand of whisky . In 2007 a play drawn from the reactions of a group of Bolton residents to the events of the final was staged at the Octagon Theatre , Bolton . 
 = History of the Oslo Tramway and Metro = 
 The history of the Oslo Tramway and Oslo Metro in Oslo ( Kristiania until 1925 ) , Norway , starts in 1875 , when Kristiania Sporveisselskab ( KSS ) opened two horsecar lines through the city centre . In 1894 , Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei ( KES ) built the first electric street tramways , which ran west from the city centre . Within six years , all tramways were electric . The city council established Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie ( KKS ) in 1899 , which built three lines before it was sold to KSS six years later . Both KSS and KES were taken over by the municipality in 1924 , becoming Oslo Sporveier . The company gradually expanded the city tram network , which reached its peak length in 1939 . 
 The Holmenkollen Line was the first light rail line , which opened in 1898 and ran west of the city . Later light rail lines in the west were the Røa Line ( opened in 1912 ) , the Lilleaker Line ( 1919 ) , the Sognsvann Line ( 1934 ) and the Kolsås Line ( 1942 ) . From 1928 , they ran to the city centre via the Common Tunnel . East of the city , the Ekeberg Line opened in 1917 , followed by the Østensjø Line ( opened in 1926 ) and the Lambertseter Line ( 1957 ) . The light rail lines were built by three private companies , Holmenkolbanen , Ekebergbanen and Bærumsbanen . By 1975 , all had been bought by Oslo Sporveier . 
 The Oslo Metro opened in 1966 , consisting of a line through the Common Tunnel to Jernbanetorget and the upgraded Lambertseter light rail line . The same year the Grorud Line opened . The next year the Østensjø Line was connected , and in 1970 the Furuset Line opened . The city council decided to close the tramways in 1960 , and several lines were closed until the decision was revoked in 1977 . In 1987 , the Common Tunnel was completed . From 1993 , the western lines were upgraded and connected to the Metro , allowing Metro trains to run through the city centre . The Metro 's Ring Line was completed in 2006 .

 The first attempt to introduce horsecar operations in Oslo ( at the time called Christiania ) were in 1868 , when the engineer Jens Theodor <unk> Vogt and the architect Paul Due applied for a concession . The application was rejected because the city council felt that the streets were too narrow . They made a second application in April 1874 , and this time permission was granted . On 26 August 1874 , Vogt and Due established Christiania Sporveisselskab ( " Christiania Tramway Company " ) . Twenty @-@ two 4 @.@ 1 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) long cars were delivered from the United States manufacturer John Stephenson Company , arriving in Christiania on 31 August 1875 . The official opening took place on 6 October 1875 . In 1879 , the city and company changed the spelling of the name " Christiania " to " Kristiania " . 
 The system initially had four standard gauge , single tracked lines , which had passing loops to allow trams to pass . Three originated at Stortorvet : the Gamlebyen Line , running east to Gamlebyen ( now Old Oslo , but then called just Oslo ) ; the Vestbanen Line , which ran west to Vestbanen station ( Oslo West station ) ; and the Ullevål Hageby Line , which ran west to Homansbyen , where the depot was located . In addition , there was a short connecting line between the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Vestbanen Line , but it was closed on 19 October 1875 . The two lines that connected to the station only ran services that corresponded with train arrivals and departures ; the other two lines had fixed fifteen @-@ minute headway — decreasing to ten minutes from 22 June 1876 . During the winter of 1875 and 1876 , the company attempted to use sleds instead of wagons . They took delivery of seventeen units , but these were not as suitable as the wagons and the company instead chose to salt the rail tracks . 
 Profits were made immediately , and in 1877 an additional seven cars were delivered . The following year , a new line from Stortorvet to Grünerløkka was built — the start of the Grünerløkka – Torshov Line — along with a new depot . The Gamlebyen Line was extended to St <unk> plass on 2 December 1878 , the Grünerløkka Line to Thorvald Meyers gate on 12 April 1879 and the Vestbanen Line to Munkedamsveien on 5 May 1879 . The following year , the lines were merged to two through services : Homansbyen – Oslo and Vestbanen – Grünerløkka . After this , the company concentrated its investments into rebuilding the system to double track . Between 1887 and 1892 , the company took delivery of 14 additional cars from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk , the same length as the Stephenson cars . The last horsecar delivery was 15 cars from Falkenried in 1897 , which were designed so they could be converted to electric tram trailers . They were 6 @.@ 6 metres ( 22 ft ) long and remained in service until 1939 . In 1880 , Kristiania Sporveisselskab registered a ridership of 1 @,@ 499 @,@ 000 passengers . 
 = = = Electrification = = = 
 The horsecar system was more expensive to operate than electric trams , and Christiania ( later Kristiania ) Elektriske Sporvei ( " Kristiania Electric Tramway " ) was founded to establish an electric tram service . The initiative came from the engineers H. E. Heyerdahl , A. <unk> @-@ Krog and consul L. Samson . KSS immediately attempted to buy the company , but the purchase failed . On 2 March 1894 , the Briskeby Line opened , which ran westwards from the Østbanen station ( Oslo East station ) via the city centre and Briskeby to Majorstuen , using a 600 volt supply . At the same time , a branch line opened from the Briskeby Line at <unk> , heading further west to Skillebekk . At first a shuttle service was provided on the branch line , but by April a through service was offered to Østbanen station . The branch line was extended to <unk> gate on 31 December 1894 , to Thune in 1901 and to Skøyen station on 21 June 1903 and is now known as the Skøyen Line . 
 The last street line built by KES was the Frogner Line , which opened in 1902 from <unk> plass on the Skøyen Line to Frogner plass . It was extended to Majorstuen , where the depot was located , on 15 May 1914 . From 1909 , KES introduced numbered services , with the Briskeby Line numbered 1 , the Frogner Line numbered 2 and the Skøyen Line numbered 3 . KES bought 78 motorized cars and 66 <unk> trailers ; of which 20 cars were later rebuilt to trailers . The main manufacturers were Herbrand , Falkenried and Skabo , who delivering a continual stream of stock to the company until 1914 . From then until 1925 , there was sufficient rolling stock that only ten more vehicles were delivered . 
 KSS decided to convert its lines to electric traction as well . The first electric trams ran on 29 September 1899 , and the conversion was completed by 15 January 1900 . At the time of electrification , KSS had 57 horsecars ; 38 of these were later converted to trailers , while 19 were decommissioned . The John Stephenson and Skabo trailers were taken out of service in 1917 – 18 , and sixteen of these were sold to the Bergen Tramway and Trondheim Tramway — the latter rebuilding them to meter gauge . One of the original Stephenson cars has been preserved at the Oslo Tramway Museum . 
 The Vestbanen Line was extended west from Vestbanen station towards Skillebekk in two stages , on 21 December 1898 and again on 23 June 1899 . The Gamlebyen Line was extended further east on 17 November 1899 to Oslo Hospital . The Vålerenga Line , which ran east from the city centre , opened on 3 May 1900 , and the Kampen Line , which ran parallel but further north , on 6 June 1900 . The first street line out of Kristiania into Aker was opened in three stages as an extension of the Grünerløkka – Torshov Line : on 29 September 1899 to Torshov , on 2 October 1901 to <unk> and , finally , to Grefsen Station on 28 November 1902 . For the electrification , KSS ordered 47 new trams from Falkenried and Waggonfabrik Linke @-@ Hoffmann ; these remained in service until 1967 . In 1900 , the tramway had a ridership of almost 17 million passengers , or 75 trips per inhabitant . 
 = = = First municipal trams = = = 
 Since both tram companies were profitable , the city council decided to start another service — Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie ( KKS , " Kristiania Municipal Tramways " ) — the first municipally owned tram operator in Norway . Sagene Ring was the first line , which opened on 24 November 1899 from Sagene to <unk> , where there was a connection onwards to Østbanen station using KES tracks . On 26 January 1901 , a connection line was built from <unk> to Kirkeristen in the city centre to avoid running on KES tracks . 
 A second KKS line was opened on 27 March 1900 , from Nybrua , located on the KSS 's Grünerløkka – Torshov Line , via Trondheimsveien to Rodeløkka . Named the Rodeløkka Line , the southern section would later become part of the Sinsen Line . From Nybrua to the city centre , KSS track was used . The depot was located at Rodeløkka . A third line opened on 28 August 1900 , from <unk> in the city centre southwards to <unk> at Vippetangen — the Vippetangen Line . Again , KSS track was needed to connect the line into the city centre . Twenty cars and twelve trailers were bought from Busch with electric components delivered from <unk> — stock that remained in service until 1967 . The company failed to make any profits , and was sold to KSS in 1905 .
