 Two vectors u and v in a Hilbert space H are orthogonal when <formula> = 0 . The notation for this is u ⊥ v. More generally , when S is a subset in H , the notation u ⊥ S means that u is orthogonal to every element from S. 
 When u and v are orthogonal , one has 
 <formula> 
 By induction on n , this is extended to any family u1 , ... , un of n orthogonal vectors , 
 <formula> 
 Whereas the Pythagorean identity as stated is valid in any inner product space , completeness is required for the extension of the Pythagorean identity to series . A series Σ uk of orthogonal vectors converges in H if and only if the series of squares of norms converges , and 
 <formula> 
 Furthermore , the sum of a series of orthogonal vectors is independent of the order in which it is taken . 
 = = = <unk> identity and polarization = = = 
 By definition , every Hilbert space is also a Banach space . Furthermore , in every Hilbert space the following parallelogram identity holds : 
 <formula> 
 Conversely , every Banach space in which the parallelogram identity holds is a Hilbert space , and the inner product is uniquely determined by the norm by the polarization identity . For real Hilbert spaces , the polarization identity is 
 <formula> 
 For complex Hilbert spaces , it is 
 <formula> 
 The parallelogram law implies that any Hilbert space is a uniformly convex Banach space . 
 = = = Best approximation = = = 
 This subsection employs the Hilbert projection theorem . If C is a non @-@ empty closed convex subset of a Hilbert space H and x a point in H , there exists a unique point y ∈ C that minimizes the distance between x and points in C , 
 <formula> 
 This is equivalent to saying that there is a point with minimal norm in the translated convex set D 
 = C − x . The proof consists in showing that every minimizing sequence ( dn ) ⊂ D is Cauchy ( using the parallelogram identity ) hence converges ( using completeness ) to a point in D that has minimal norm . More generally , this holds in any uniformly convex Banach space . 
 When this result is applied to a closed subspace F of H , it can be shown that the point y ∈ F closest to x is characterized by 
 <formula> 
 This point y is the orthogonal projection of x onto F , and the mapping PF : x → y is linear ( see Orthogonal complements and projections ) . This result is especially significant in applied mathematics , especially numerical analysis , where it forms the basis of least squares methods . 
 In particular , when F is not equal to H , one can find a non @-@ zero vector v orthogonal to F ( select x not in F and v = 
 x − y ) . A very useful criterion is obtained by applying this observation to the closed subspace F generated by a subset S of H. 
 A subset S of H spans a dense vector subspace if ( and only if ) the vector 0 is the sole vector v ∈ H orthogonal to S. 
 = = = Duality = = = 
 The dual space H * is the space of all continuous linear functions from the space H into the base field . It carries a natural norm , defined by 
 <formula> 
 This norm satisfies the parallelogram law , and so the dual space is also an inner product space . The dual space is also complete , and so it is a Hilbert space in its own right . 
 The Riesz representation theorem affords a convenient description of the dual . To every element u of H , there is a unique element <unk> of H * , defined by 
 <formula> 
 The mapping <formula> is an antilinear mapping from H to H * . The Riesz representation theorem states that this mapping is an antilinear isomorphism . Thus to every element φ of the dual H * there exists one and only one uφ in H such that 
 <formula> 
 for all x ∈ H. The inner product on the dual space H * satisfies 
 <formula> 
 The reversal of order on the right @-@ hand side restores linearity in φ from the <unk> of uφ . In the real case , the antilinear isomorphism from H to its dual is actually an isomorphism , and so real Hilbert spaces are naturally isomorphic to their own duals . 
 The representing vector uφ is obtained in the following way . When φ ≠ 0 , the kernel F 
 = Ker ( φ ) is a closed vector subspace of H , not equal to H , hence there exists a non @-@ zero vector v orthogonal to F. The vector u is a suitable scalar multiple λv of v. The requirement that φ ( v ) = 
 ⟨ v , u ⟩ yields 
 <formula> 
 This correspondence φ ↔ u is exploited by the bra – ket notation popular in physics . It is common in physics to assume that the inner product , denoted by ⟨ x | y ⟩ , is linear on the right , 
 <formula> 
 The result ⟨ x | y ⟩ can be seen as the action of the linear functional ⟨ x | ( the bra ) on the vector | y ⟩ ( the ket ) . 
 The Riesz representation theorem relies fundamentally not just on the presence of an inner product , but also on the completeness of the space . In fact , the theorem implies that the topological dual of any inner product space can be identified with its completion . An immediate consequence of the Riesz representation theorem is also that a Hilbert space H is reflexive , meaning that the natural map from H into its double dual space is an isomorphism . 
 = = = Weakly convergent sequences = = = 
 In a Hilbert space H , a sequence { xn } is weakly convergent to a vector x ∈ H when 
 <formula> 
 for every v ∈ H. 
 For example , any orthonormal sequence { fn } converges weakly to 0 , as a consequence of Bessel 's inequality . Every weakly convergent sequence { xn } is bounded , by the uniform <unk> principle . 
 Conversely , every bounded sequence in a Hilbert space admits weakly convergent subsequences ( <unk> 's theorem ) . This fact may be used to prove minimization results for continuous convex functionals , in the same way that the Bolzano – Weierstrass theorem is used for continuous functions on Rd . Among several variants , one simple statement is as follows : 
 If f : H → R is a convex continuous function such that f ( x ) tends to + ∞ when | | x | | tends to ∞ , then f admits a minimum at some point x0 ∈ H. 
 This fact ( and its various generalizations ) are fundamental for direct methods in the calculus of variations . Minimization results for convex functionals are also a direct consequence of the slightly more abstract fact that closed bounded convex subsets in a Hilbert space H are weakly compact , since H is reflexive . The existence of weakly convergent subsequences is a special case of the <unk> – <unk> theorem . 
 = = = Banach space properties = = = 
 Any general property of Banach spaces continues to hold for Hilbert spaces . The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets . A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem , that a continuous and bijective linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism ( that is , a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous ) . This theorem is considerably simpler to prove in the case of Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces . The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem , which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set . In the case of Hilbert spaces , this is basic in the study of unbounded operators ( see closed operator ) . 
 The ( geometrical ) Hahn – Banach theorem asserts that a closed convex set can be separated from any point outside it by means of a hyperplane of the Hilbert space . This is an immediate consequence of the best approximation property : if y is the element of a closed convex set F closest to x , then the separating hyperplane is the plane perpendicular to the segment xy passing through its midpoint . 
 = = Operators on Hilbert spaces = = 
 = = = Bounded operators = = = 
 The continuous linear operators A : H1 → H2 from a Hilbert space H1 to a second Hilbert space H2 are bounded in the sense that they map bounded sets to bounded sets . Conversely , if an operator is bounded , then it is continuous . The space of such bounded linear operators has a norm , the operator norm given by 
 <formula> 
 The sum and the composite of two bounded linear operators is again bounded and linear . For y in H2 , the map that sends x ∈ H1 to ⟨ Ax , y ⟩ is linear and continuous , and according to the Riesz representation theorem can therefore be represented in the form 
 <formula> 
 for some vector A * y in H1 . This defines another bounded linear operator A * : H2 → H1 , the adjoint of A. One can see that A * * = A. 
 The set B ( H ) of all bounded linear operators on H , together with the addition and composition operations , the norm and the adjoint operation , is a C * <unk> , which is a type of operator algebra . 
 An element A of B ( H ) is called self @-@ adjoint or Hermitian if A * 
 = A. If A is Hermitian and ⟨ Ax , x ⟩ ≥ 0 for every x , then A is called non @-@ negative , written A ≥ 0 ; if equality holds only when x = 
 0 , then A is called positive . The set of self adjoint operators admits a partial order , in which A ≥ B if A − B ≥ 0 . If A has the form B * B for some B , then A is non @-@ negative ; if B is invertible , then A is positive . A converse is also true in the sense that , for a non @-@ negative operator A , there exists a unique non @-@ negative square root B such that 
 <formula> 
 In a sense made precise by the spectral theorem , self @-@ adjoint operators can usefully be thought of as operators that are " real " . An element A of B ( H ) is called normal if A * A 
 = A A * . Normal operators decompose into the sum of a self @-@ adjoint operators and an imaginary multiple of a self adjoint operator 
 <formula> 
 that commute with each other . Normal operators can also usefully be thought of in terms of their real and imaginary parts . 
 An element U of B ( H ) is called unitary if U is invertible and its inverse is given by U * . This can also be expressed by requiring that U be onto and ⟨ <unk> , <unk> ⟩ = 
 ⟨ x , y ⟩ for all x and y in H. The unitary operators form a group under composition , which is the isometry group of H. 
 An element of B ( H ) is compact if it sends bounded sets to relatively compact sets . Equivalently , a bounded operator T is compact if , for any bounded sequence { <unk> } , the sequence { <unk> } has a convergent subsequence . Many integral operators are compact , and in fact define a special class of operators known as Hilbert – Schmidt operators that are especially important in the study of integral equations . <unk> operators differ from a compact operator by a multiple of the identity , and are equivalently characterized as operators with a finite dimensional kernel and <unk> . The index of a <unk> operator T is defined by 
 <formula> 
 The index is homotopy invariant , and plays a deep role in differential geometry via the Atiyah – Singer index theorem . 
 = = = <unk> operators = = = 
 <unk> operators are also tractable in Hilbert spaces , and have important applications to quantum mechanics . An unbounded operator T on a Hilbert space H is defined as a linear operator whose domain D ( T ) is a linear subspace of H. Often the domain D ( T ) is a dense subspace of H , in which case T is known as a densely defined operator . 
 The adjoint of a densely defined unbounded operator is defined in essentially the same manner as for bounded operators . Self @-@ adjoint unbounded operators play the role of the observables in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics . Examples of self @-@ adjoint unbounded operators on the Hilbert space L2 ( R ) are : 
 A suitable extension of the differential operator 
 <formula> 
 where i is the imaginary unit and f is a differentiable function of compact support . 
 The multiplication @-@ by @-@ x operator : 
 <formula> 
 These correspond to the momentum and position observables , respectively . Note that neither A nor B is defined on all of H , since in the case of A the derivative need not exist , and in the case of B the product function need not be square integrable . In both cases , the set of possible arguments form dense subspaces of L2 ( R ) . 
 = = Constructions = = 
 = = = Direct sums = = = 
 Two Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 can be combined into another Hilbert space , called the ( orthogonal ) direct sum , and denoted 
 <formula> 
 consisting of the set of all ordered pairs ( x1 , x2 ) where xi ∈ Hi , i = 1 @,@ 2 , and inner product defined by 
 <formula> 
 More generally , if Hi is a family of Hilbert spaces indexed by i ∈ I , then the direct sum of the Hi , denoted 
 <formula> 
 consists of the set of all indexed families 
 <formula> 
 in the Cartesian product of the Hi such that 
 <formula> 
 The inner product is defined by 
 <formula> 
 Each of the Hi is included as a closed subspace in the direct sum of all of the Hi . Moreover , the Hi are pairwise orthogonal . Conversely , if there is a system of closed subspaces , Vi , i ∈ I , in a Hilbert space H , that are pairwise orthogonal and whose union is dense in H , then H is canonically isomorphic to the direct sum of Vi . In this case , H is called the internal direct sum of the Vi . A direct sum ( internal or external ) is also equipped with a family of orthogonal projections Ei onto the ith direct summand Hi . These projections are bounded , self @-@ adjoint , <unk> operators that satisfy the orthogonality condition 
 <formula> 
 The spectral theorem for compact self @-@ adjoint operators on a Hilbert space H states that H splits into an orthogonal direct sum of the eigenspaces of an operator , and also gives an explicit decomposition of the operator as a sum of projections onto the eigenspaces . The direct sum of Hilbert spaces also appears in quantum mechanics as the Fock space of a system containing a variable number of particles , where each Hilbert space in the direct sum corresponds to an additional degree of freedom for the quantum mechanical system . In representation theory , the Peter – Weyl theorem guarantees that any unitary representation of a compact group on a Hilbert space splits as the direct sum of finite @-@ dimensional representations . 
 = = = Tensor products = = = 
 If x1 , y1 <unk> H1 and x2 , y2 <unk> H2 , then one defines an inner product on the ( ordinary ) tensor product as follows . On simple tensors , let 
 <formula> 
 This formula then extends by <unk> to an inner product on H1 ⊗ H2 . The Hilbertian tensor product of H1 and H2 , sometimes denoted by <formula> , is the Hilbert space obtained by completing H1 ⊗ H2 for the metric associated to this inner product . 
 An example is provided by the Hilbert space L2 ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) . The Hilbertian tensor product of two copies of L2 ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) is isometrically and linearly isomorphic to the space L2 ( [ 0 , 1 ] 2 ) of square @-@ integrable functions on the square [ 0 , 1 ] 2 . This isomorphism sends a simple tensor f1 ⊗ f2 to the function 
 <formula> 
 on the square . 
 This example is typical in the following sense . Associated to every simple tensor product x1 ⊗ x2 is the rank one operator from H ∗ 
 1 to H2 that maps a given <formula> as 
 <formula> 
 This mapping defined on simple tensors extends to a linear identification between H1 ⊗ H2 and the space of finite rank operators from H * 1 to H2 . This extends to a linear isometry of the Hilbertian tensor product <formula> with the Hilbert space HS ( H * 1 , H2 ) of Hilbert – Schmidt operators from H * 1 to H2 . 
 = = <unk> bases = = 
 The notion of an orthonormal basis from linear algebra generalizes over to the case of Hilbert spaces . In a Hilbert space H , an orthonormal basis is a family { ek } k ∈ B of elements of H satisfying the conditions : 
 <unk> : Every two different elements of B are orthogonal : <formula> for all k , j in B with k ≠ j . 
 Normalization : Every element of the family has norm 1 : | | ek | | 
 = 1 for all k in B. 
 Completeness : The linear span of the family ek , k ∈ B , is dense in H. 
 A system of vectors satisfying the first two conditions basis is called an orthonormal system or an orthonormal set ( or an orthonormal sequence if B is countable ) . Such a system is always linearly independent . Completeness of an orthonormal system of vectors of a Hilbert space can be equivalently restated as : 
 if ⟨ v , ek ⟩ = 
 0 for all k ∈ B and some v ∈ H then v 
 = 0 . 
 This is related to the fact that the only vector orthogonal to a dense linear subspace is the zero vector , for if S is any orthonormal set and v is orthogonal to S , then v is orthogonal to the closure of the linear span of S , which is the whole space . 
 Examples of orthonormal bases include : 
 the set { ( 1 @,@ 0 @,@ 0 ) , ( 0 @,@ 1 @,@ 0 ) , ( 0 @,@ 0 @,@ 1 ) } forms an orthonormal basis of R3 with the dot product ; 
 the sequence { fn : n ∈ Z } with fn ( x ) = 
 exp ( <unk> ) forms an orthonormal basis of the complex space L2 ( [ 0 @,@ 1 ] ) ; 
 In the infinite @-@ dimensional case , an orthonormal basis will not be a basis in the sense of linear algebra ; to distinguish the two , the latter basis is also called a Hamel basis . That the span of the basis vectors is dense implies that every vector in the space can be written as the sum of an infinite series , and the orthogonality implies that this decomposition is unique . 
 = = = Sequence spaces = = = 
 The space ℓ2 of square @-@ summable sequences of complex numbers is the set of infinite sequences 
 <formula> 
 of complex numbers such that 
 <formula> 
 This space has an orthonormal basis : 
 <formula> 
 More generally , if B is any set , then one can form a Hilbert space of sequences with index set B , defined by 
 <formula> 
 The summation over B is here defined by 
 <formula> 
 the supremum being taken over all finite subsets of B. It follows that , for this sum to be finite , every element of ℓ2 ( B ) has only countably many nonzero terms . This space becomes a Hilbert space with the inner product 
 <formula> 
 for all x and y in ℓ2 ( B ) . Here the sum also has only countably many nonzero terms , and is unconditionally convergent by the Cauchy – Schwarz inequality . 
 An orthonormal basis of ℓ2 ( B ) is indexed by the set B , given by 
 <formula> 
 = = = Bessel 's inequality and Parseval 's formula = = = 
 Let f1 , … , fn be a finite orthonormal system in H. For an arbitrary vector x in H , let 
 <formula> 
 Then ⟨ x , fk ⟩ 
 = ⟨ y , fk ⟩ for every k = 
 1 , … , n . It follows that x − y is orthogonal to each fk , hence x − y is orthogonal to y . Using the Pythagorean identity twice , it follows that 
 <formula> 
 Let { fi } , i ∈ I , be an arbitrary orthonormal system in H. Applying the preceding inequality to every finite subset J of I gives the Bessel inequality 
 <formula> 
 ( according to the definition of the sum of an arbitrary family of non @-@ negative real numbers ) . 
 Geometrically , Bessel 's inequality implies that the orthogonal projection of x onto the linear subspace spanned by the fi has norm that does not exceed that of x . In two dimensions , this is the assertion that the length of the leg of a right triangle may not exceed the length of the hypotenuse . 
 Bessel 's inequality is a stepping stone to the more powerful Parseval identity , which governs the case when Bessel 's inequality is actually an equality . If { ek } k ∈ B is an orthonormal basis of H , then every element x of H may be written as 
 <formula> 
 Even if B is uncountable , Bessel 's inequality guarantees that the expression is well @-@ defined and consists only of countably many nonzero terms . This sum is called the Fourier expansion of x , and the individual coefficients ⟨ x , ek ⟩ are the Fourier coefficients of x . Parseval 's formula is then 
 <formula> 
 Conversely , if { ek } is an orthonormal set such that Parseval 's identity holds for every x , then { ek } is an orthonormal basis . 
 = = = Hilbert dimension = = = 
 As a consequence of Zorn 's lemma , every Hilbert space admits an orthonormal basis ; furthermore , any two orthonormal bases of the same space have the same cardinality , called the Hilbert dimension of the space . For instance , since ℓ2 ( B ) has an orthonormal basis indexed by B , its Hilbert dimension is the cardinality of B ( which may be a finite integer , or a countable or uncountable cardinal number ) . 
 As a consequence of Parseval 's identity , if { ek } k ∈ B is an orthonormal basis of H , then the map Φ : H → ℓ2 ( B ) defined by Φ ( x ) = ( ⟨ x , ek ⟩ ) k ∈ B is an isometric isomorphism of Hilbert spaces : it is a bijective linear mapping such that 
 <formula> 
 for all x and y in H. The cardinal number of B is the Hilbert dimension of H. Thus every Hilbert space is isometrically isomorphic to a sequence space ℓ2 ( B ) for some set B. 
 = = = <unk> spaces = = = 
 A Hilbert space is separable if and only if it admits a countable orthonormal basis . All infinite @-@ dimensional separable Hilbert spaces are therefore isometrically isomorphic to ℓ2 . 
 In the past , Hilbert spaces were often required to be separable as part of the definition . Most spaces used in physics are separable , and since these are all isomorphic to each other , one often refers to any infinite @-@ dimensional separable Hilbert space as " the Hilbert space " or just " Hilbert space " . Even in quantum field theory , most of the Hilbert spaces are in fact separable , as stipulated by the Wightman axioms . However , it is sometimes argued that non @-@ separable Hilbert spaces are also important in quantum field theory , roughly because the systems in the theory possess an infinite number of degrees of freedom and any infinite Hilbert tensor product ( of spaces of dimension greater than one ) is non @-@ separable . For instance , a <unk> field can be naturally thought of as an element of a tensor product whose factors represent harmonic oscillators at each point of space . From this perspective , the natural state space of a boson might seem to be a non @-@ separable space . However , it is only a small separable subspace of the full tensor product that can contain physically meaningful fields ( on which the observables can be defined ) . Another non @-@ separable Hilbert space models the state of an infinite collection of particles in an unbounded region of space . An orthonormal basis of the space is indexed by the density of the particles , a continuous parameter , and since the set of possible densities is uncountable , the basis is not countable . 
 = = Orthogonal complements and projections = = 
 If S is a subset of a Hilbert space H , the set of vectors orthogonal to S is defined by 
 <formula> 
 S ⊥ is a closed subspace of H ( can be proved easily using the linearity and continuity of the inner product ) and so forms itself a Hilbert space . If V is a closed subspace of H , then V ⊥ is called the orthogonal complement of V. In fact , every x in H can then be written uniquely as x 
 = v + w , with v in V and w in V ⊥ . Therefore , H is the internal Hilbert direct sum of V and V ⊥ . 
 The linear operator PV : H → H that maps x to v is called the orthogonal projection onto V. There is a natural one @-@ to @-@ one correspondence between the set of all closed subspaces of H and the set of all bounded self @-@ adjoint operators P such that P2 = 
 P. Specifically , 
 Theorem . The orthogonal projection PV is a self @-@ adjoint linear operator on H of norm ≤ 1 with the property P2V 
 = PV . Moreover , any self @-@ adjoint linear operator E such that E2 = 
 E is of the form PV , where V is the range of E. For every x in H , PV ( x ) is the unique element v of V , which minimizes the distance | | x − v | | . 
 This provides the geometrical interpretation of PV ( x ) : it is the best approximation to x by elements of V. 
 Projections PU and PV are called mutually orthogonal if PUPV 
 = 0 . This is equivalent to U and V being orthogonal as subspaces of H. The sum of the two projections PU and PV is a projection only if U and V are orthogonal to each other , and in that case PU + PV = 
 PU + V. The composite PUPV is generally not a projection ; in fact , the composite is a projection if and only if the two projections commute , and in that case PUPV 
 = PU ∩ V. 
 By restricting the <unk> to the Hilbert space V , the orthogonal projection PV gives rise to a projection mapping π : H → V ; it is the adjoint of the inclusion mapping 
 <formula> 
 meaning that 
 <formula> 
 for all x ∈ V and y ∈ H. 
 The operator norm of the orthogonal projection PV onto a non @-@ zero closed subspace V is equal to one : 
 <formula> 
 Every closed subspace V of a Hilbert space is therefore the image of an operator P of norm one such that P2 = 
 P. The property of possessing appropriate projection operators characterizes Hilbert spaces : 
 A Banach space of dimension higher than 2 is ( isometrically ) a Hilbert space if and only if , for every closed subspace V , there is an operator PV of norm one whose image is V such that <formula> 
 While this result characterizes the metric structure of a Hilbert space , the structure of a Hilbert space as a topological vector space can itself be characterized in terms of the presence of complementary subspaces : 
 A Banach space X is topologically and linearly isomorphic to a Hilbert space if and only if , to every closed subspace V , there is a closed subspace W such that X is equal to the internal direct sum V ⊕ W. 
 The orthogonal complement satisfies some more elementary results . It is a monotone function in the sense that if U ⊂ V , then <formula> with equality holding if and only if V is contained in the closure of U. This result is a special case of the Hahn – Banach theorem . The closure of a subspace can be completely characterized in terms of the orthogonal complement : If V is a subspace of H , then the closure of V is equal to <formula> . The orthogonal complement is thus a Galois connection on the partial order of subspaces of a Hilbert space . In general , the orthogonal complement of a sum of subspaces is the intersection of the orthogonal complements : <formula> . If the Vi are in addition closed , then <formula> . 
 = = Spectral theory = = 
 There is a well @-@ developed spectral theory for self @-@ adjoint operators in a Hilbert space , that is roughly analogous to the study of symmetric matrices over the reals or self @-@ adjoint matrices over the complex numbers . In the same sense , one can obtain a " <unk> " of a self @-@ adjoint operator as a suitable sum ( actually an integral ) of orthogonal projection operators . 
 The spectrum of an operator T , denoted σ ( T ) is the set of complex numbers λ such that T − λ lacks a continuous inverse . If T is bounded , then the spectrum is always a compact set in the complex plane , and lies inside the disc <formula> If T is self @-@ adjoint , then the spectrum is real . In fact , it is contained in the interval [ m , M ] where 
 <formula> 
 Moreover , m and M are both actually contained within the spectrum . 
 The eigenspaces of an operator T are given by 
 <formula> 
 Unlike with finite matrices , not every element of the spectrum of T must be an eigenvalue : the linear operator T − λ may only lack an inverse because it is not surjective . Elements of the spectrum of an operator in the general sense are known as spectral values . Since spectral values need not be eigenvalues , the spectral decomposition is often more subtle than in finite dimensions . 
 However , the spectral theorem of a self @-@ adjoint operator T takes a particularly simple form if , in addition , T is assumed to be a compact operator . The spectral theorem for compact self @-@ adjoint operators states : 
 A compact self @-@ adjoint operator T has only countably ( or finitely ) many spectral values . The spectrum of T has no limit point in the complex plane except possibly zero . The eigenspaces of T decompose H into an orthogonal direct sum : 
 <formula> 
 Moreover , if Eλ denotes the orthogonal projection onto the <unk> <unk> , then 
 <formula> 
 where the sum converges with respect to the norm on B ( H ) . 
 This theorem plays a fundamental role in the theory of integral equations , as many integral operators are compact , in particular those that arise from Hilbert – Schmidt operators . 
 The general spectral theorem for self @-@ adjoint operators involves a kind of operator @-@ valued Riemann – Stieltjes integral , rather than an infinite summation . The spectral family associated to T associates to each real number λ an operator Eλ , which is the projection onto the <unk> of the operator ( T − λ ) + , where the positive part of a self @-@ adjoint operator is defined by 
 <formula> 
 The operators Eλ are monotone increasing relative to the partial order defined on self @-@ adjoint operators ; the eigenvalues correspond precisely to the jump discontinuities . One has the spectral theorem , which asserts 
 <formula> 
 The integral is understood as a Riemann – Stieltjes integral , convergent with respect to the norm on B ( H ) . In particular , one has the ordinary scalar @-@ valued integral representation 
 <formula> 
 A somewhat similar spectral decomposition holds for normal operators , although because the spectrum may now contain non @-@ real complex numbers , the operator @-@ valued Stieltjes measure <unk> must instead be replaced by a resolution of the identity . 
 A major application of spectral methods is the spectral mapping theorem , which allows one to apply to a self @-@ adjoint operator T any continuous complex function f defined on the spectrum of T by forming the integral 
 <formula> 
 The resulting continuous functional calculus has applications in particular to <unk> operators . 
 The spectral theory of unbounded self @-@ adjoint operators is only marginally more difficult than for bounded operators . The spectrum of an unbounded operator is defined in precisely the same way as for bounded operators : λ is a spectral value if the resolvent operator 
 <formula> 
 fails to be a well @-@ defined continuous operator . The self @-@ adjointness of T still guarantees that the spectrum is real . Thus the essential idea of working with unbounded operators is to look instead at the resolvent <unk> where λ is non @-@ real . This is a bounded normal operator , which admits a spectral representation that can then be transferred to a spectral representation of T itself . A similar strategy is used , for instance , to study the spectrum of the Laplace operator : rather than address the operator directly , one instead looks as an associated resolvent such as a Riesz potential or Bessel potential . 
 A precise version of the spectral theorem in this case is : 
 Given a densely defined self @-@ adjoint operator T on a Hilbert space H , there corresponds a unique resolution of the identity E on the Borel sets of R , such that 
 <formula> 
 for all x ∈ D ( T ) and y ∈ H. The spectral measure E is concentrated on the spectrum of T. 
 There is also a version of the spectral theorem that applies to unbounded normal operators . 
 = Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng = 
 The Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng ( VNQDĐ ) , also known as the Việt Quốc , the Vietnamese Nationalist Party or the Vietnamese Kuomintang , is a nationalist and moderate socialist political party that sought independence from French colonial rule in Vietnam during the early 20th century . Its origins lie in the mid @-@ 1920s , when a group of young Hanoi @-@ based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material . In 1927 , after the publishing house failed because of French harassment and censorship , the VNQDD was formed under the leadership of Nguyễn Thái Học . Modelling itself on the Republic of China 's Kuomintang ( the same 3 characters in <unk> Hán : <unk> ) the VNQDD gained a following among northerners , particularly teachers and intellectuals . The party , which was less successful among peasants and industrial workers , was organised in small clandestine cells . 
 From 1928 , the VNQDD attracted attention through its assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators . A turning point came in February 1929 with the Bazin assassination , the killing of a French labour recruiter widely despised by local Vietnamese people . Although the perpetrators ' precise affiliation was unclear , the French authorities held the VNQDD responsible . Between 300 and 400 of the party 's approximately 1 @,@ 500 members were detained in the resulting crackdown . Many of the leaders were arrested , but Học managed to escape . 
 In late 1929 , the party was weakened by an internal split . Under increasing French pressure , the VNQDD leadership switched tack , replacing a strategy of isolated clandestine attacks against individuals with a plan to expel the French in a single blow with a large @-@ scale popular uprising . After stockpiling home @-@ made weapons , the VNQDD launched the Yên Bái mutiny on February 10 , 1930 with the aim of sparking a widespread revolt . VNQDD forces combined with disaffected Vietnamese troops , who mutinied against the French colonial army . The mutiny was quickly put down , with heavy French retribution . Học and other leading figures were captured and executed and the VNQDD never regained its political strength in the country . 
 Some remaining factions sought peaceful means of struggle , while other groups fled across the border to Kuomintang bases in the Yunnan province of China , where they received arms and training . During the 1930s , the party was eclipsed by Ho Chi Minh 's Indochinese Communist Party ( ICP ) . Vietnam was occupied by Japan during World War II and , in the chaos that followed the Japanese surrender in 1945 , the VNQDD and the ICP briefly joined forces in the fight for Vietnamese independence . However , after a falling out , Ho purged the VNQDD , leaving his communist @-@ dominated Viet Minh unchallenged as the foremost anti @-@ colonial militant organisation . As a part of the post @-@ war settlement that ended the First Indochina War , Vietnam was partitioned into two zones . The remnants of the VNQDD fled to the anti @-@ communist south , where they remained until the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule . Today , the party survives only among overseas Vietnamese . 
 = = Origins = = 
 French involvement in Vietnam started in the late 18th century when the Catholic priest Pigneau de <unk> assisted Nguyễn Ánh , to found the Nguyễn Dynasty by recruiting French volunteers . In return , Nguyen Anh , who took the reign name Gia Long allowed Catholic missionaries to operate in Vietnam . However , relations became strained under Gia Long 's successor Minh Mạng as missionaries sought to incite revolts in an attempt to enthrone a Catholic . This prompted anti @-@ Christian edicts , and in 1858 , a French invasion of Vietnam was mounted , ostensibly to protect Catholicism , but in reality for colonial purposes . The French steadily made gains and completed the colonisation of Vietnam in 1883 . Armed revolts against colonial rule occurred regularly , most notably through the Cần Vương movement of the late @-@ 1880s . In the early @-@ 20th century , the 1916 southern revolts and the Thái Nguyên uprising were notable disruptions to the French administration . 
 In late 1925 , a small group of young Hanoi @-@ based intellectuals , led by a teacher named Pham Tuan Tai and his brother Pham Tuan Lam , started the Nam Dong Thu Xa ( Southeast Asia Publishing House ) . They aimed to promote violent revolution as a means of gaining independence for Vietnam from French colonisation , and published books and brochures about Sun Yat @-@ sen and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 , as well as opening a free school to teach <unk> <unk> ( Romanised Vietnamese script ) to the working class . The group soon attracted the support of other progressive young northerners , including students and teachers led by Nguyễn Thái Học . Học was an alumnus of Hanoi 's Commercial School , who had been stripped of a scholarship because of his mediocre academic performance . 
 Harassment and censorship imposed by the French colonial authorities led to the commercial failure of the Nam Dong Thu Xa . By the autumn of 1927 , the group 's priorities turned towards more direct political action , in a bid to appeal to more radical elements in the north . Membership grew to around 200 , distributed among 18 cells in 14 provinces across northern and central Vietnam . 
 = = Formation = = 
 The Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang ( VNQDD ) was formed at a meeting in Hanoi on December 25 , 1927 , with Nguyễn Thái Học as the party 's first leader . It was Vietnam 's first home @-@ grown revolutionary party , established three years before the Indochinese Communist Party . The party advocated socialism , but at the outset there was considerable debate over its other fundamental objectives . Many wanted it to promote worldwide revolution , rather than limiting itself to campaigning for an independent Vietnamese republic ; but there were fears that this would lead to accusations of communism , putting off potential Vietnamese supporters who yearned above all for independence . In a bid for moderation , the final statement was a compromise that read : 
 The aim and general line of the party is to make a national revolution , to use military force to overthrow the feudal colonial system , to set up a democratic republic of Vietnam . At the same time we will help all oppressed nationalities in the work of struggling to achieve independence , in particular such neighboring countries as Laos and Cambodia . 
 Although the VNQDD modelled itself on Sun Yat @-@ sen 's Chinese Nationalist Party ( the Kuomintang or KMT , later led by Chiang Kai @-@ shek ) , even down to copying the " Nationalist Party " designation , it had no direct relationship with its Chinese counterpart and in fact did not gain much attention outside Vietnam until the Yên Bái mutiny in 1930 . Like the KMT , it was a clandestine organisation held together with tight discipline . Its basic unit was the cell , above which there were several levels of administration , including provincial , regional and central committees . Also like the KMT , the VNQDD 's revolutionary strategy envisaged a military takeover , followed by a period of political training for the population before a constitutional government could take control . 
 Most party members were teachers , employees of the French colonial government or non @-@ commissioned officers in the colonial army . The VNQDD campaigned mainly among these facets of society — there were few workers or peasants in its ranks . The party 's popularity was based on a groundswell of anti @-@ French feeling in northern Vietnam in the 1920s ; many writers had assailed society for glorifying military actions against China , Champa , Siam and Cambodia , Vietnam 's historical rivals , while neglecting to oppose French colonialism . The VNQDD admitted many female members , which was quite revolutionary for the time . It set about seeking alliances with other nationalist factions in Vietnam . In a meeting on July 4 , 1928 , the Central Committee appealed for unity among the Vietnamese revolutionary movements , sending delegates to meet with other organisations struggling for independence . The preliminary contacts did not yield any concrete alliances . The VNQDD also assailed the Vietnamese communists of Ho Chi Minh for betraying the leading nationalist of the time — Phan Bội Châu — to the French in return for a financial reward . Ho had done this to eliminate other nationalist rivals . The VNQDD would later be on the receiving end of another of Ho 's manoeuvres . 
 = = Initial activities = = 
 Financial problems compounded the VNQDD 's difficulties . Money was needed to set up a commercial enterprise , a cover for the revolutionaries to meet and plot , and for raising funds . For this purpose , a hotel @-@ restaurant named the Vietnam Hotel was opened in September 1928 . The French colonial authorities were aware of the real purpose of the business , and put it under surveillance without taking further preliminary action . The first notable reorganisation of the VNQDD was in December , when Nguyen Khac Nhu replaced Hoc as chairman . Three proto @-@ governmental organs were created , to form the legislative , executive and judicial arms of government . The records of the French secret service estimated that by early 1929 , the VNQDD consisted of approximately 1 @,@ 500 members in 120 cells , mostly in areas around the Red River Delta . The intelligence reported that most members were students , minor merchants or low @-@ level bureaucrats in the French administration . The report stated that there were landlords and wealthy peasants among the members , but that few were of scholar @-@ gentry ( mandarin ) rank . According to the historian Cecil B. Currey , " The VNQDD 's lower @-@ class origins made it , in many ways , closer to the labouring poor than were the Communists , many of whom … [ were ] from established middle @-@ class families . " 
 Beginning in 1928 , the VNQDD attracted substantial Vietnamese support , provoking increased attention from the French colonial administration . This came after a VNQDD death squad killed several French officials and Vietnamese collaborators who had a reputation for cruelty towards the Vietnamese populace . 
 = = Assassination of Bazin = = 
 The assassination of Hanoi @-@ based French labour recruiter Hervé Bazin on February 9 , 1929 , was a turning point that marked the beginning of the VNQDD 's decline . A graduate of the École Coloniale in Paris , Bazin directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations . Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion , because the foremen who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker . On the plantations , living conditions were poor and the remuneration was low , leading to widespread indignation . In response , Vietnamese hatred of Bazin led to thoughts of an assassination . A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill Bazin . Học felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by the French Sûreté , thereby weakening the party . He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French , viewing Bazin as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus . 
 Turned down by the VNQDD leadership , one of the assassination 's proponents — it is unclear whether or not he was a party member — created his own plot . With an accomplice , he shot and killed Bazin on February 9 , 1929 , as the Frenchman left his mistress 's house . The French attributed the attack to the VNQDD and reacted by apprehending all the party members they could find : between three and four hundred men were rounded up , including 36 government clerks , 13 French government officials , 36 schoolteachers , 39 merchants , 37 landowners and 40 military personnel . The subsequent trials resulted in 78 men being convicted and sentenced to jail terms ranging between five and twenty years . The arrests severely depleted the VNQDD leadership : most of the Central Committee were captured , though Học and Nhu were among the few who escaped from a raid on their hideout at the Vietnam Hotel . 
 = = Internal split and change in strategy = = 
 In 1929 , the VNQDD split when a faction led by Nguyen The Nghiep began to disobey party orders and was therefore expelled from the Central Committee . Some sources claim that Nghiep had formed a breakaway party and had begun secret contacts with French authorities . 
 <unk> by those who betrayed fellow members to the French and the problems this behaviour caused , Học convened a meeting to tighten regulations in mid @-@ 1929 at the village of Lac Dao , along the Gia Lam – Haiphong railway . This was also the occasion for a shift in strategy : Học argued for a general uprising , citing rising discontent among Vietnamese soldiers in the colonial army . More moderate party leaders believed this move to be premature , and cautioned against it , but Học 's stature meant he prevailed in shifting the party 's orientation towards violent struggle . One of the arguments presented for large @-@ scale violence was that the French response to the Bazin assassination meant that the party 's strength could decline in the long term . The plan was to provoke a series of uprisings at military posts around the Red River Delta in early 1930 , where VNQDD forces would join Vietnamese soldiers in an attack on the two major northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong . The leaders agreed to restrict their uprisings to Tonkin , because the party was weak elsewhere . 
 For the remainder of 1929 , the party prepared for the revolt . They located and manufactured weapons , storing them in hidden depots . The preparation was hindered by French police , particularly the seizure of arms caches . 
 = = Yên Bái mutiny = = 
 At around 01 : 30 on Monday , February 10 , 1930 , approximately 40 troops belonging to the 2nd Battalion of the Fourth Régiment de Tirailleurs <unk> stationed at Yên Bái , reinforced by around 60 civilian members of the VNQDD , attacked their 29 French officers and warrant officers . The rebels had intended to split into three groups : the first group was to infiltrate the infantry , kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support among Vietnamese troops ; the second , supported by the VNQDD civilians , was to break into the post headquarters ; and the third group would enter the officers ' quarters . The French were caught off guard ; five were killed and three seriously wounded . The mutineers isolated a few more French officers from their men , even managing to raise the VNQDD flag above one of the buildings . About two hours later , however , it became apparent that the badly coordinated uprising had failed , and the remaining 550 Vietnamese soldiers helped quell the rebellion rather than participate in it . The insurrectionists had failed to liquidate the Garde indigène town post and could not convince the frightened townspeople to join them in a general revolt . At 07 : 30 , a French Indochinese counterattack scattered the mutineers ; two hours later , order was re @-@ established in Yên Bái . 
 That same evening , two further insurrectionary attempts failed in the Sơn Dương sector . A raid on the Garde indigène post in Hưng Hóa was repelled by the Vietnamese guards , who appeared to have been tipped off . In the nearby town of <unk> Khe , VNQDD members killed the instructor Nguyen Quang <unk> and one of his wives . After destroying the Garde indigène post in Lâm Thao , the VNQDD briefly seized control of the district seat . At sunrise , a new Garde indigène unit arrived and inflicted heavy losses on the insurgents , mortally wounding Nhu . Aware of the events in the upper delta region , Pho Duc Chinh fled and abandoned a planned attack on the Sơn Tây garrison , but he was captured a few days later by French authorities . 
 On February 10 , a VNQDD member injured a policeman at a Hanoi checkpoint ; at night , Arts students threw bombs at government buildings , which they regarded as part of the repressive power of the colonial state . On the night of February 15 – 16 , Học and his remaining forces seized the nearby villages of Phu Duc and Vĩnh Bảo , in Thái Bình and Hải Dương provinces respectively , for a few hours . In the second village , the VNQDD killed the local mandarin of the French colonial government , Tri <unk> . On February 16 , French warplanes responded by bombarding the VNQDD 's last base at Co Am village ; on the same day , Tonkin 's Resident Superior René Robin dispatched 200 Gardes <unk> , eight French commanders and two Sûreté inspectors . A few further violent incidents occurred until February 22 , when Governor @-@ General Pierre Pasquier declared that the insurrection had been defeated . Học and his lieutenants , Chinh and Nguyen Thanh Loi , were apprehended . 
 A series of trials were held to prosecute those arrested during the uprising . The largest number of death penalties was handed down by the first Criminal Commission , which convened at Yen Bay . Among the 87 people found guilty at Yen Bay , 46 were servicemen . Some argued in their own defence that they had been " surprised and forced to take part in the insurrection " . Of the 87 convicted , 39 were sentenced to death , five to deportation , 33 to life sentences of forced labour , nine to 20 years imprisonment , and one to five years of forced labour . Of those condemned to death , 24 were civilians and 15 were servicemen . Presidential pardons reduced the number of death penalties from 39 to 13 . Học and Chinh were among the 13 who were executed on June 17 , 1930 . The condemned men cried " Viet Nam ! " as the guillotine fell . Học wrote a final plea to the French , in a letter that claimed that he had always wanted to cooperate with French authorities , but that their intransigence had forced him to revolt . Học contended that France could only stay in Indochina if they dropped their " brutal " policies , and became more amiable towards the Vietnamese . The VNQDD leader called for universal education , training in commerce and industry , and an end to the corrupt practices of the French @-@ installed mandarins . 
 = = Exile in Yunnan = = 
 Following Yen Bay , the VNQDD became more diffuse , with many factions effectively acting virtually autonomously of one another . Le Huu <unk> — who had tried to stall the failed mutiny — attempted to reunite what remained of the party under the banner of peaceful reform . Other factions , however , remained faithful to Học 's legacy , recreating the movement in the Hanoi @-@ Haiphong area . A failed assassination attempt on Governor @-@ General Pasquier led to French crackdowns in 1931 and 1932 . The survivors escaped to Yunnan in southern China , where some of Nghiep 's supporters were still active . The Yunnan VNQDD was in fact a section of the Chinese Kuomintang , who protected its members from the Chinese government while funds were raised by robbery and extortion along the Sino @-@ Vietnamese border . This eventually led to a Chinese government crackdown , but VNQDD members continued to train at the Yunnan Military School ; some enlisted in the nationalist Chinese army while others learned to manufacture weapons and munitions in the Yunnan arsenal . 
 Nghiep was briefly jailed by Yunnan authorities , but continued to run the party from his cell . Upon his release in 1933 , Nghiep consolidated the party with similar groups in the area , including some followers of Phan Bội Châu who had formed a Canton @-@ based organisation with similar aims in 1925 . Chau 's group had formed in opposition to the communist tendencies of Ho Chi Minh 's Revolutionary Youth League . However , Ho betrayed Chau to eliminate a potential rival and to pocket a reward . With nationalist Chinese aid , Chau 's followers had set up a League of Oppressed Oriental Peoples , a Pan @-@ Asian group that ended in failure . In 1932 the League made the point of declaring a " Provisional Indochinese Government " at Canton . In July 1933 , Chau 's group was integrated into Nghiep 's Yunnan organisation . In 1935 , Nghiep surrendered to the French consulate in Shanghai . The remainder of the VNQDD was paralysed by infighting and began losing political relevance , with only moderate activity until the outbreak of World War II and Japan 's invasion of French Indochina in 1940 . They attempted to organise workers along the Yunnan railway , threatening occasional border assaults , with little success . 
 The VNQDD was gradually overshadowed as the leading Vietnamese independence organisation by Ho 's Indochinese Communist Party ( ICP ) . In 1940 , Ho arrived in Yunnan , which was a hotbed of both ICP and VNQDD activity . He initiated collaboration between the ICP and other nationalists such as the VNQDD . At the time , World War II had broken out and Japan had conquered most of eastern China and replaced the French in Vietnam . Ho moved east to the neighbouring province of Guangxi , where Chinese military leaders had been attempting to organise Vietnamese nationalists against the Japanese . The VNQDD had been active in Guangxi and some of their members had joined the KMT army . Under the umbrella of KMT activities , a broad alliance of nationalists emerged . With Ho at the forefront , the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi ( Vietnamese Independence League , usually known as the Viet Minh ) was formed and based in the town of <unk> . The pro @-@ VNQDD nationalist Ho Ngoc Lam , a KMT army officer and former disciple of Phan Boi Chau , was named as the deputy of Phạm Văn Đồng , later to be Ho 's Prime Minister . The front was later broadened and renamed the Viet Nam Giai Phong Dong Minh ( Vietnam Liberation League ) . It was an uneasy situation , as another VNQDD leader , Truong Boi Cong , a graduate of a KMT military academy , wanted to challenge the communists for pre @-@ eminence , while Vũ Hồng Khanh led a virulently anti @-@ communist VNQDD faction . The Viet Nam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups , run by the pro Chinese VNQDD . Chinese KMT General Zhang <unk> created the league to further Chinese influence in Indochina , against the French and Japanese . Its stated goal was for unity with China under the Three Principles of the People , created by KMT founder Dr. Sun and opposition to Vietnamese and French Imperialists . The Revolutionary League was controlled by Nguyen Hai Than , who was born in China and could not speak Vietnamese . General Zhang shrewdly blocked the Communists of Vietnam , and Ho Chi Minh from entering the league , as his main goal was Chinese influence in Indochina . The KMT utilized these Vietnamese nationalists during World War II against Japanese forces . At one stage , the communists made an appeal for other Vietnamese anti @-@ colonialists to join forces , but condemned Khanh as an " opportunist " and " fake revolutionary " in their letter . The cooperation in the border area lasted for only a few months before VNQDD officials complained to the local KMT officials that the communists , led by Dong and Võ Nguyên Giáp , were attempting to dominate the league . This prompted the local authorities to shut down the front 's activities . 
 = = Post World War II = = 
 In March 1945 , the VNQDD received a boost , when Imperial Japan , which had occupied Vietnam since 1941 , deposed the French administration , and installed the Empire of Vietnam , a puppet regime . This resulted in the release of some anti @-@ French activists , including VNQDD members . 
 In August 1945 , Ho 's Viet Minh seized power and set up a provisional government in the wake of Japan 's withdrawal from Vietnam . This move violated a prior agreement between the member parties of the Viet Nam <unk> Mang Dong Minh Hoi ( Vietnamese Revolutionary League ) , which included the VNQDD as well as the Vietminh , and Ho was pressured to broaden his government 's appeal by including the VNQDD ( now led by Nguyễn Tường Tam ) . The Vietminh announced that they would abolish the mandarin governance system and hold national elections with universal suffrage in two hold . The VNQDD objected to this , fearing that the communists would perpetrate electoral fraud . 
 After the seizure of power , hundreds of VNQDD members returned from China , only to be killed at the border by the Vietminh . Nevertheless , the VNQDD arrived in northern Vietnam with arms and supplies from the KMT , in addition to its prestige as a Vietnamese nationalist organisation . Nationalist China backed the VNQDD in the hope of gaining more influence over its southern neighbour . Ho tried to broaden his support in order to strengthen himself , in addition to decreasing Chinese and French power . He hoped that by co @-@ opting VNQDD members , he could shut out the KMT . The communists had no intention of sharing power with anyone in the long term and regarded the move as purely a strategic exercise . Giap , the Vietminh 's military chief , called the VNQDD a " group of reactionaries plotting to rely on Chiang Kai @-@ Shek 's Kuomintang and their rifle barrels to snatch a few crumbs " . The VNQDD dominated the main control lines between northern Vietnam and China near <unk> Cai . They funded their operations from the tribute that they levied from the local populace . Once the majority of the non @-@ communist nationalists had returned to Vietnam , the VNQDD banded with them to form an anti @-@ Vietminh alliance . The VNQDD and the Dai Viet Quoc Dan Dang ( <unk> , Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam ) started their own military academy at Yên Bái to train their own military recruits . Armed confrontations between the Vietminh and the nationalists occurred regularly in major northern cities . The VNQDD were aided by the KMT , who were in northern Vietnam as the result of an international agreement to stabilise the country . The KMT often disarmed local Vietminh bands . 
 The VNQDD then established their national headquarters in Hanoi , and began to publish newspapers , expounding their policies and explaining their ideology . The OSS agent Archimedes Patti , who was based in Kunming and northern Vietnam , reported that the VNQDD were " hopelessly disoriented politically " and felt that they had no idea of how to run a government . He speculated that the VNQDD were driven by " desires for personal power and economic gain " . Giap accused them of being " bandits " . Military and newspaper attacks between the groups occurred regularly , but a power @-@ sharing agreement was put in place until the elections occurred in order to end the attacks and strengthen national unity to further the goal of independence . The communists also allowed the VNQDD to continue printing material . 
 However , the agreement was ineffective in the meantime . The VNQDD kidnapped Giap and the Propaganda Minister Tran Huy Lieu and held them for three weeks until Ho agreed to remove Giáp and Lieu from the cabinet . As a result , the VNQDD 's Vũ Hồng Khanh became defence minister , with Giap as his deputy . What the VNQDD and other non @-@ communist nationalists thought to be an equitable power @-@ sharing agreement turned out to be a ruse . Every non @-@ communist minister had a communist deputy , and if the former refused to approve a decree , the Vietminh official would do so . Many ministers were excluded from knowing the details of their portfolio ; Khanh was forbidden to see any military statistics and some were forbidden to attend cabinet meetings . In one case , the Minister of Social Works became a factory worker because he was forced to remain politically idle . Meanwhile , Giáp was able to stymie the activities of VNQDD officials of higher rank in the coalition government . Aside from shutting down the ability of the VNQDD officials to disseminate information , he often ordered his men to start riots and street brawls at public VNQDD events . 
 Ho scheduled elections for December 23 , but he made a deal with the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi , which assured them of 50 and 20 seats in the new national assembly respectively , regardless of the poll results . This only temporarily placated the VNQDD , which continued its skirmishes against the Vietminh . Eventually , Chinese pressure on the VNQDD and the Dong Minh Hoi saw them accept a coalition government , in which Tam served as foreign minister . For the communists ' part , they accused the KMT of intimidating them into sharing power with the VNQDD , and claimed that VNQDD soldiers had tried to attack polling stations . The VNQDD claimed that the communists had engaged in vote fraud and intimidation , citing Vietminh claims that they had received tallies in excess of 80 % in areas controlled by French troops . 
 = = War against French colonial rule = = 
 The Ho – Sainteny agreement , signed on March 6 , 1946 , saw the return of French colonial forces to Vietnam , replacing the Chinese nationalists who were supposed to be maintaining order . The VNQDD were now without their main supporters . As a result , the VNQDD were further attacked by the French , who often encircled VNQDD strongholds , enabling Viet Minh attacks . Giáp 's army hunted down VNQDD troops and cleared them from the Red River Delta , seizing arms and arresting party members , who were falsely charged with crimes ranging from counterfeiting to unlawful arms possession . The Viet Minh massacred thousands of VNQDD members and other nationalists in a large scale purge . Most of the survivors fled to China or French @-@ controlled areas in Vietnam . After driving the VNQDD out of their Hanoi headquarters on On Nhu Hau Street , Giáp ordered his agents to construct an underground torture chamber on the premises . They then planted exhumed and badly decomposed bodies in the chamber , and accused the VNQDD of gruesome murders , although most of the dead were VNQDD members who had been killed by Giáp 's men . The communists made a public spectacle of the scene in an attempt to discredit the VNQDD , but the truth eventually came out and the " On Nhu Hau Street affair " lowered their public image . 
 When the National Assembly reconvened in Hanoi on October 28 , only 30 of the 50 VNQDD seats were filled . Of the 37 VNQDD and Dong Minh Hoi members who turned up , only 20 remained by the end of the session . By the end of the year , Tam had resigned as foreign minister and fled to China , and only one of the three original VNQDD cabinet members was still in office . In any case , the VNQDD never had any power , despite their numerical presence . Upon the opening of the National Assembly , the communist majority voted to vest power in an executive committee almost entirely consisting of communists ; the legislature met only once a year . In any case , the façade of a legislature was dispensed with as the First Indochina War went into full flight . A small group of VNQDD fighters escaped Giáp 's assault and retreated to a mountainous enclave along the Sino @-@ Vietnamese border , where they declared themselves to be the government of Vietnam , with little effect . 
 = = Post @-@ independence = = 
 After Vietnam gained independence in 1954 , the Geneva Accords partitioned the country into a communist north and an anti @-@ communist south , but stipulated that there were to be 300 days of free passage between the two zones . During Operation Passage to Freedom , most VNQDD members migrated to the south . 
 The VNQDD was deeply divided after years of communist pressure , lacked strong leadership and no longer had a coherent military presence , although they had a large presence in central Vietnam . The party 's disarray was only exacerbated by the actions of autocratic President Ngô Đình Diệm , who imprisoned many of its members . Diem 's administration was a " dictatorship by Catholics — A new kind of fascism " , according to the title of a VNQDD pamphlet published in July 1955 . The VNQDD tried to revolt against Diem in 1955 in central Vietnam . During the transition period after Geneva , the VNQDD sought to set up a new military academy in central Vietnam , but they were crushed by Ngô Đình Cẩn , who ran the region for his elder brother Diệm , dismantled and jailed VNQDD members and leaders . 
 Many officers in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam felt that Diệm discriminated against them because of their political leanings . Diệm used the secret Catholic Cần Lao Party to keep control of the army and stifle attempts by VNQDD members to rise through the ranks . 
 During the Diệm era , the VNQDD were implicated in two failed coup attempts . In November 1960 , a paratrooper revolt failed after the mutineers agreed to negotiate , allowing time for loyalists to relieve the president . Many of the officers involved had links to or were members of the VNQDD , and fled the country after the coup collapsed . In 1963 , VNQDD leaders Tam and Vũ Hồng Khanh were among those arrested for their involvement in the plot ; Tam committed suicide before the case started , and Khanh was jailed . In February 1962 , two Vietnam Air Force pilots , Nguyễn Văn <unk> — son of a prominent VNQDD leader — and Phạm Phú Quốc , bombarded the Independence Palace in a bid to kill the president and his family , but their targets escaped unharmed . Diem was eventually deposed in a military coup and killed in November 1963 . While the generals that led the coup were not members of the VNQDD , they sought to cultivate ARVN officers who were part of the VNQDD because of their antipathy towards Diem . 
 Many VNQDD members were part of the ARVN , which sought to prevent South Vietnam from being overrun by communists during the Vietnam War , and they were known for being more anti @-@ communist than most of their compatriots . 
 After the fall of Diệm and the execution of Cẩn in May 1964 , the VNQDD became more active in their strongholds in central Vietnam . Nevertheless , there was no coherent national leadership and groups at district and provincial level tended to operate autonomously . By 1965 , their members had managed to infiltrate and take over the Peoples Action Teams ( PATs ) , irregular paramilitary counter @-@ insurgency forces organised by Australian Army advisers to fight the communists , and used them for their own purposes . In December , one VNQDD member had managed to turn his PAT colleagues towards the nationalist agenda , and the local party leadership in Quảng Nam approached the Australians in an attempt to have the 1000 @-@ man PAT outfit formally allied to the VNQDD . The overture was rejected . The politicisation of paramilitary units worked both ways ; some province chiefs used the anti @-@ communist forces to assassinate political opponents , including VNQDD members . 
 In 1966 , the Buddhist Uprising erupted in central Vietnam , in which some Buddhist leaders fomented civil unrest against the war , hoping to end foreign involvement in Vietnam and end the conflict through a peace deal with the communists . The VNQDD remained implacably opposed to any coexistence with the communists . Members of the VNQDD made alliances with Catholics , collected arms , and engaged in pro @-@ war street clashes with the Buddhists , forcing elements of the ARVN to intervene to stop them . 
 On April 19 , clashes erupted in Quảng Ngãi Province between the Buddhists and the VNQDD , prompting the local ARVN commander Tôn Thất Đính to forcibly restrain the two groups . Three days later the VNQDD accused the Buddhists of attacking their premises in Hội An and Da Nang , while US officials reported that the VNQDD were making plans to assassinate leading Buddhists , such as the activist monk Thích Trí Quang . 
 The VNQDD contested their national elections of 1967 , the first elections since the fall of Diem , which were rigged — Diem and his people invariably gained more than 95 % of the vote and sometimes exceeded the number of registered voters . The campaign was disorganised due to a lack of infrastructure and some VNQDD candidates were not formally sanctioned by any hierarchy . The VNQDD focused on the districts in I Corps in central Vietnam where they were thought to be strong . There were 60 seats in the senate , and the six victorious tickets would see all ten of their members elected . The VNQDD entered eight tickets in the senate election , and while they totalled 15 % of the national vote between them , the most of any grouping , it was diluted between the groupings ; none of the tickets and thus none of the candidates were elected . This contrasted with one Catholic alliance with three tickets that won only 8 % of the vote , but had all 30 candidates elected . They won nine seats in the lower house , a small minority presence , all from districts in central Vietnam , where they tended to poll between 20 and 40 % in various areas . The VNQDD members made several loose alliances with Hòa Hảo members of the lower house . 
 During the Tet Offensive of 1968 , the communists attacked and seized control of the central city of Huế for a month . During this time , they executed around 3 @,@ 000 – 6 @,@ 000 people that they had taken prisoner , out of a total population of 140 @,@ 000 . The communists had compiled a list of " reactionaries " to be liquidated before their assault . Known for their virulent anti @-@ communism , VNQDD members appeared to have been disproportionately targeted in the massacre . 
 After the Fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War , the remnants of the VNQDD were again targeted by the victorious communists . As Vietnam is a single @-@ party state led by the Vietnamese Communist Party , the VNQDD is illegal . Some VNQDD members fled to the West , where they continued their political activities . The VNQDD remains respected among some sections of the overseas Vietnamese community as Vietnam 's leading anti @-@ communist organisation .

 After the release of The Jazz Singer , all the major film companies were racing to hire audio engineers so they could record and reproduce sound for film . Through common acquaintances at Electrical Research Products , Inc . ( ERPI ) within Western Electric , Hilliard was contacted and hired by United Artists Studios ( UA ) in Hollywood , California in 1928 because of his studies in physics , engineering and acoustics . Having left his Masters studies behind in Minnesota , Hilliard , not yet 28 years old , supervised all sound recording for Coquette , UA 's first talking motion picture . Western Electric provided recording equipment , but the specific techniques for achieving best sound on film had to be developed by hard work and imagination . Hilliard 's ground @-@ breaking methods later became industry standards . 
 = = = MGM = = = 
 In 1933 , MGM hired Hilliard away from UA . His first assignment was to fix their problematic recording amplifiers whose overall phase shift measured out to a voice @-@ distorting 1500 degrees . Hilliard 's solution was to use higher linearity transformers obtained from Lansing Manufacturing Company , in consultation with founder Jim Lansing . Earlier , Hilliard had befriended a laboratory associate of his wife 's , Dr. John Blackburn , and in 1934 , he helped Blackburn get a position as design engineer at Lansing Manufacturing . The following year , Hilliard and his team at MGM solved the problem of recording Nelson Eddy 's strong operatic baritone alongside Jeanette MacDonald 's flat and weak soprano voice , picking up an Academy Award for Sound Recording on the duo 's first film together : Naughty Marietta . 
 As part of his work to reduce the weight of sound equipment at MGM , Hilliard approached James " Jim " Cannon of Cannon Electric in Los Angeles regarding the machining of a smaller , lighter version of Cannon 's heavy @-@ duty electrical connectors that Western Electric had been using for motors and microphones . The resulting lightweight six @-@ pin Cannon connector eventually evolved to become the industry standard three @-@ pin connector for microphones ; the XLR connector . Though the Great Depression was underway , Cannon Electric was kept very busy producing the popular connectors for film studios . 
 While at MGM , Hilliard was asked by Gordon Mitchell to chair the Motion Picture Research Council 's sound committee . Hilliard 's first task was standardizing a uniform method of reproducing film sound in the theater . He began by standardizing recording techniques among eight major film studios . Later , with Harry Kimball , he helped develop the 1938 " Academy Curve " , a standard filter that attenuated recorded noise above 8 @,@ 000 Hz while retaining prominent voice reproduction characteristics . 
 = = = Shearer Horn System = = = 
 Hilliard 's continued contact with Lansing and Blackburn led to a conversation about the poor state of loudspeakers in movie theaters . The three men shared ideas about how best to improve existing designs . Hilliard took his plans to MGM 's head of sound , Douglas Shearer ( brother of Norma Shearer ) , who decided to fund the effort . Hilliard was made responsible for the concept and design of the project . Lansing Manufacturing was tapped to develop the drive units while Hilliard worked to improve the electronic components . What came out of this collaboration was a well @-@ received industry standard loudspeaker system , " The Shearer Horn System for Theatres " ( 1937 ) , that garnered a technical award " Oscar " for sound from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . 
 In May 1941 , Lansing Manufacturing was bought by All Technical Services Company , an outgrowth of Western Electric 's ERPI division which had become independent . The resulting company , with the established film industry contacts of ERPI combined with the extended manufacturing capability of Lansing , reformed as Altec Lansing . Hilliard had contacts in both parent firms .

 In 1942 when the United States was preparing to fight a long , technically challenging war , Hilliard left MGM to join his friend Blackburn who had begun research for Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) to work on radar development for U.S. military applications . His work at MIT in Cambridge , Massachusetts led in 1943 to an employment opportunity back in Los Angeles at Altec Lansing where he improved their Magnetic Anomaly Detector ( MAD , also known as " Magnetic Airborne Detection " ) system for Anti @-@ submarine warfare ( ASW ) . 
 = = = Voice of the Theatre = = = 
 In 1944 , Hilliard returned to entertainment acoustics with Altec Lansing . Improving on the Shearer Horn System , Hilliard worked with Jim Lansing and Blackie Blackburn to develop the loudspeaker system of the 20th century : the Voice of the Theatre ( <unk> ) . Arriving in the marketplace in 1945 , it offered better coherence and clarity at high power levels . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics ; they made it the movie theater industry standard in 1955 . Production of the long @-@ lived <unk> continued into the 1990s . 
 = = Altec = = 
 In 1946 , Hilliard took over as Vice President of Engineering due to Jim Lansing 's leaving Altec to start a new enterprise which would become JBL . Hilliard remained VP Engineering at Altec until 1960 during which time he supervised the development of sectoral horns , significant reductions in the size of the condenser microphone , many amplifier and crossover designs , and a major reworking and improvement of the Altec Lansing Duplex 604 , the well @-@ known high @-@ fidelity coaxial loudspeaker driver originally designed by George Carrington , Sr. , who was then president of Altec Lansing . 
 As chief engineer at Altec , Hilliard joined the Hollywood section of the Sapphire Group , a regular social gathering of sound recordists and a precursor to the Audio Engineering Society . In 1948 , Hilliard was elected to chair the Sapphire Group Recording Standards Committee . He made certain , along with the Motion Picture Research Council , that proposed industry standards were forwarded to members of National Association of Broadcasters ( NAB ) , Institute of Radio Engineers ( IRE ) , Acoustical Society of America ( ASA ) and Royal Musical Association ( RMA ) . Hilliard helped form the Los Angeles section of the Audio Engineering Society ( AES ) in 1951 . At the beginning of 1963 , IRE merged with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers ( <unk> ) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ( IEEE ) — Hilliard retained his Fellowship . 
 = = Noise studies = = 
 In 1960 , Hilliard became director of the Ling @-@ Temco @-@ Vought ( LTV ) Western Research Center where he widened his scope of research to include the study of sonic booms , missile launch noise , atmospheric noise refraction , highway noise mitigation , hearing conservation and gun silencing . He helped develop an air @-@ driven noise generator that produced 10 @,@ 000 acoustic watts and was driven by a 300 horsepower ( 220 kW ) diesel engine . He helped NASA with voice communication equipment including long lines between Cape Canaveral and Houston as well as assisting the Air Force with their worldwide telephone system . He worked on military listening systems . In 1968 , Hilliard retired from regular employment at LTV , continuing to work with LTV as a consultant but in the same manner as if he hadn 't retired . In the early 1970s , Hilliard directed the hearing conservation program at Bio @-@ Medical Engineering Corporation . He founded <unk> and Associates in the mid @-@ 1970s , performing architectural acoustic analysis and creating the standards for California 's multi @-@ family housing construction acoustic design policies , significantly influencing interior and exterior noise @-@ control standards for homeowners across the United States . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 While he was undertaking his post @-@ graduate studies in Minnesota , Hilliard married Jessamine Hilliard , a published researcher in the fields of allergies , enzymes , hormones and radiology . She accompanied him to California when UA offered him a job . In 1932 , she introduced Hilliard to a young electrical engineer working at her Los Angeles laboratory , a doctoral graduate fresh out of Caltech : Dr. John " Blackie " Blackburn , a man Hilliard would continue to associate and collaborate with in many technical endeavors . 
 Hilliard ceased consulting in 1985 and died on March 21 , 1989 . Friends said he helped lay out a loudspeaker sales demonstration booth just months before he died .

 = Pink whipray = 
 The pink whipray ( Himantura fai ) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae , with a wide but ill @-@ defined distribution in the tropical Indo @-@ Pacific from southern Africa to Polynesia . It is a bottom dweller that generally inhabits shallow water under 70 m ( 230 ft ) deep , in sandy areas associated with coral reefs . Individuals exhibit a high degree of fidelity to particular locations . The pink whipray has a diamond @-@ shaped pectoral fin disc wider than long , with a broad @-@ angled snout and a very long , whip @-@ like tail without fin folds . It has only a few small thorns on its back and is uniform brownish to grayish pink in color , becoming much darker past the tail sting . This large ray can reach 1 @.@ 8 m ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) across and over 5 m ( 16 ft ) long . 
 Gregarious in nature , the pink whipray has been known to form large active and resting aggregations , and associate with other large ray species . It preys mainly on prawns , but also consumes other benthic invertebrates and bony fishes . This species is aplacental viviparous , in which the unborn young are nourished by histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) produced by the mother . Across much of its range , substantial numbers of pink whiprays are caught incidentally by a variety of fishing gear and marketed for meat , skin , and cartilage . It is also of importance to ecotourism , being attracted to visitors with bait . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed this species under Least Concern , due to its wide distribution that includes relatively protected areas , such as northern Australia . However , its population in Southeast Asia is likely declining under heavy fishing pressure , and there it has been assessed as Vulnerable . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The pink <unk> was described by American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Alvin Seale in the 1906 volume of Bulletin of the Bureau of Fisheries , on the basis of a specimen 37 cm ( 15 in ) across collected off Apia , Samoa . The specific epithet fai means " stingray " in the native languages of Samoa , Tonga , Futuna , and Tahiti . Another common name for this species is Tahitian stingray . In 2004 , Mabel Manjaji grouped H. fai with H. <unk> , H. jenkinsii , H. leoparda , H. toshi , H. uarnak , and H. undulata in the uarnak species complex . 
 = = Description = = 
 The pectoral fin disc of the pink whipray is diamond @-@ shaped and thick at the center , measuring about 1 @.@ 1 – 1 @.@ 2 times wider than long . The outer corners of the disc are angular . The snout forms a very obtuse angle , with the tip barely protruding . The small , widely spaced eyes are followed by larger spiracles . There is a short and broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the long , thin nostrils . The mouth is fairly small and surrounded by prominent furrows ; the lower jaw has a small indentation in the middle . There are two large central and two tiny lateral papillae on the floor of the mouth . The teeth are small and arranged into pavement @-@ like surfaces . Five pairs of gill slits are located beneath the disc . The pelvic fins are small and narrow . 
 The tail is extremely long and thin , measuring at least twice the disc length when intact . It lacks fin folds and usually bears a single serrated stinging spine . Adults have small , rounded dermal denticles covering the central dorsal surface of the disc , beginning in front of the eyes and extending to cover the entire tail ; there are also small , sharp thorns on the midline , which become densest at the base of the tail . Juveniles are either smooth @-@ skinned or have a sparser covering of flat , heart @-@ shaped denticles . This species is uniform grayish to brownish pink above , becoming dark gray to black on the tail past the sting , and uniformly light below . It grows to at least 1 @.@ 8 m ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) across and over 5 m ( 16 ft ) long . Its maximum weight on record is 19 kg ( 42 lb ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The exact range of the pink whipray is unclear due to confusion with the Jenkins ' whipray ( H. jenkinsii ) . It is believed to be common throughout the tropical waters of the Indo @-@ Pacific , probably occurring all around Indian Ocean periphery from South Africa to northern Australia , from the year 2014 appears in the Red Sea . Its range extends to the Pacific Ocean , northward to the Philippines , the Ryukyu Islands , and Iriomote , and eastward to various islands including Micronesia , the Marquesas Islands , and Samoa . 
 The pink whipray has been recorded from as deep as 200 m ( 660 ft ) , but is usually found from the intertidal zone to a depth of 70 m ( 230 ft ) . This bottom @-@ dwelling species prefers sandy flats , lagoons , and other soft @-@ bottomed habitats , often near cays and atolls in coral reefs . It tends to be found closer to shore during the warm season . Genetic and telemetry studies across Polynesian islands have found that individual rays tend to remain within a local area , with very little between @-@ island movement . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Small to large gatherings of pink whiprays have been observed over sandy flats and coral reefs in Shark Bay , on the Great Barrier Reef , and in the Caroline Islands . When resting , up to ten individuals may pile atop one another , sometimes mixing with other species . On Ningaloo Reef , it has been seen " riding " on larger species of rays . The pink whipray feeds primarily on decapod crustaceans , but also takes cephalopods , and teleost fishes . In Shark Bay , penaeid prawns are by far the dominant prey type for rays of all sizes . At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia , sizable feeding aggregations are known to form at night in shallow water . However , at Moorea it tends to be a solitary forager with a large home range . 
 Like other stingrays , the pink whipray is aplacental viviparous , with the mother supplying her developing embryos with nutrient @-@ rich histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) through specialized uterine structures . The newborns measure 55 – 60 cm ( 22 – 24 in ) across . Shark Bay may be a nursery area for this species . Males reach sexual maturity at 1 @.@ 1 – 1 @.@ 2 m ( 3 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 9 ft ) across , while the maturation size for females is unknown . Known parasites of the pink whipray include the monogeneans Heterocotyle <unk> , Monocotyle <unk> , M. <unk> , M. youngi , <unk> <unk> , Neoentobdella <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , the tapeworm <unk> <unk> , and the isopod Gnathia grandilaris . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Though not highly dangerous to humans , the pink whipray 's venomous sting makes it difficult to handle when it is thrashing in a fishing net . Usually , it must be thrown overboard before the rest of the catch can be sorted . Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia , and probably elsewhere in its range , this species is a regular incidental catch of coastal fisheries using tangle nets , bottom trawls , gillnets , seine nets , and to a lesser extent longlines . When retained , the meat , skin , and cartilage are utilized . Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated , and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate . The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes ( Rhynchobatus ) , and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters . Off northern Australia , the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery ( NPF ) , but bycatch levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle <unk> Devices ( TEDs ) and Bycatch Reduction Devices ( <unk> ) became compulsory in 2000 . 
 The pink whipray is valuable to ecotourism at sites in the Maldives , French Polynesia , and elsewhere ; they are attracted to visitors in large numbers by the promise of food . The government of the Maldives has taken steps to preserve ray ecotourism by banning all exports of ray products in 1995 . In 2005 , stingray ecotourism at Moorea brought in over € 500 @,@ 000 . However , a 2008 study of Moorea whiprays found a negative effect of ecotourism in the form of bite and impact injuries , stemming from artificially high ray density and interactions with boat traffic at the feeding sites . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the pink whipray as Least Concern overall , citing its wide distribution that includes refuge regions with few conservation threats . The population off northern Australia , which is one of these refuges , has also been listed under Least Concern . By contrast , the heavily fished Southeast Asian population has been listed as Vulnerable . 
 = Richard Bellingham = 
 Richard Bellingham ( c . 1592 – 7 December 1672 ) was a colonial magistrate , lawyer , and several @-@ time governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , and the last surviving signatory of the colonial charter at his death . A wealthy lawyer in Lincolnshire prior to his departure for the New World in 1634 , he was a liberal political opponent of the moderate John Winthrop , arguing for expansive views on suffrage and lawmaking , but also religiously somewhat conservative , opposing ( at times quite harshly ) the efforts of Quakers and Baptists to settle in the colony . He was one of the architects of the Massachusetts Body of Liberties , a document embodying many sentiments also found in the United States Bill of Rights . 
 Although he was generally in the minority during his early years in the colony , he served ten years as colonial governor , most of them during the delicate years of the English Restoration , when King Charles II scrutinized the behavior of the colonial governments . Bellingham notably refused a direct order from the king to appear in England , an action that may have contributed to the eventual revocation of the colonial charter in 1684 . 
 He was twice married , survived by his second wife and his only son Samuel . He died in 1672 , leaving an estate in present @-@ day Chelsea , Massachusetts and a large house in Boston . The estate became embroiled in legal action lasting more than 100 years after his will was challenged by his son and eventually set aside . Bellingham is immortalized in Nathaniel Hawthorne 's The Scarlet Letter and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's The New England Tragedies , both of which fictionalize events from colonial days . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Richard Bellingham , the son of William Bellingham and Frances <unk> , was born in Lincolnshire , England , in about 1592 . The family was apparently well to do ; they resided in a manor at <unk> Wood near Scunthorpe . He studied law at Brasenose College , Oxford , matriculating on 1 December 1609 . In 1625 he was elected Recorder ( the highest community legal post ) of Boston , a position he held until 1633 . He represented Boston as a member of Parliament in 1628 and 1629 . He was first married to Elizabeth Backhouse of Swallowfield , Berkshire , with whom he had a number of children , although only their son Samuel survived to adulthood . 
 In 1628 he became an investor in the Massachusetts Bay Company , and was one of the signers of the land grant issued to it by the Plymouth Council for New England . His name also appears on the royal charter issued for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 . In 1633 he resigned as recorder of Boston and began selling off his properties . The next year he sailed for the New World with his wife and son ; Elizabeth died not long after their arrival in Boston , Massachusetts . 
 = = Massachusetts Bay Colony = = 
 Bellingham immediately assumed a prominent role in the colony , serving on the committee that oversaw the affairs of Boston ( a precursor to the board of selectmen ) . In this role he participated in the division of community lands that included the establishment of Boston Common . Not long after his arrival , he purchased the ferry service between Boston and Winnessimmett ( present @-@ day Chelsea ) from Samuel Maverick , along with tracts of land that encompass much of Chelsea . In addition to his mansion house in Boston , he also established a country home near the ferry in Winnessimmett . A house he built in 1659 still stands in Chelsea , and is known as the Bellingham @-@ Cary House . 
 For many years he was elected to the colony 's council of assistants , which advised the governor on legislative matters and served as a judicial body , and he also served several terms as colonial treasurer . He was first elected deputy governor of the colony in 1635 , at a time when the dominant John Winthrop was out of favor , and was elected to the post again in 1640 . In 1637 , during the Antinomian Controversy , he was one of the magistrates that sat during the trial of Anne Hutchinson , and voted for her to be banished from the colony . According to historian Francis Bremer , Bellingham was somewhat brash and antagonistic , and he and Winthrop repeatedly clashed on political matters . During these early years Bellingham was chosen to be on the first board of overseers of Harvard College . He also contributed to the development of the colony 's first legal code , known as the Massachusetts Body of Liberties . This work was opposed and repeatedly stalled by Winthrop , who favored a common law approach to legislation . 
 In 1641 Bellingham was elected governor for the first time , running against Winthrop . The Body of Liberties was formally adopted during his term . However , he served for just one year , and was replaced by Winthrop in 1642 . Bellingham 's defeat may have been caused in part by the scandalous impropriety surrounding his second marriage . A friend who was a guest in his house had been courting Penelope Pelham , a young woman of twenty . According to Winthrop , Bellingham , now 50 and a widower , won her heart , and , without waiting for the formalities of the banns of marriage , officiated at his own wedding . When the issue came before the colonial magistrates , Bellingham ( as the governor and chief magistrate ) refused to step down from the bench to face the charges , thus bringing the matter to a somewhat awkward end . Bellingham 's term in office was characterized by Winthrop as extremely difficult : " The General Court was full of uncomfortable agitations and contentions by reason of Bellingham 's unfriendliness to some other magistrates . He set himself in an opposite frame to them in all proceedings , which did much to retard business " . 
 In the 1640s constitutional issues concerning the power of the assistants arose . In a case involving an escaped pig , the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow 's errant animal . She appealed to the general court , which ruled in her favor . The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court 's decision , sparking the controversy . John Winthrop argued that the assistants , as experienced magistrates , must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court , because " a democracy is , amongst most civil nations , accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government . " Bellingham was one of only two assistants ( the other was Richard Saltonstall ) who opposed the final decision that the assistants ' veto should stand . Bellingham and Saltonstall were often in a minority that opposed the more conservative views of Winthrop and Thomas Dudley . In 1648 Bellingham sat on a committee established to demonstrate that the colony 's legal codes were not " repugnant to the laws of England " , as called for by the colonial charter . 
 In 1650 , when Bellingham was an assistant , he concurred in the judicial decision banning William Pynchon 's The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption , which expressed views many Puritans considered heretical . Bellingham was again elected governor in 1654 , and again in May 1665 after the death of Governor John Endecott . He was thereafter annually re @-@ elected to the post until his death , ultimately serving a total of ten years as governor and thirteen as deputy governor . While he was deputy to Endecott in 1656 , a boat carrying several Quakers arrived in Boston . Since Endecott was in Salem at the time , Bellingham directed the government 's reaction to their arrival . Because Quakerism was anathema to the Puritans , the Quakers were confined to the ship , their belongings were searched , and books promoting their religion were destroyed . After five weeks of captivity , they were sent back to England . During Endecott 's administration the penalties for Quakers defying banishment from the colony were made progressively harsher , until they included the imposition of the death penalty for repeat offenders . Under these laws , four Quakers were put to death for returning to the colony after their banishment . Quaker historians have also been harsh in their assessments of Bellingham . After Massachusetts authorities agreed that the death penalty did not work ( it had long term negative consequences , feeding perceptions of Massachusetts intransigence ) , the law was modified to reduce the penalties to branding and whipping . 
 = = English Restoration = = 
 The 1640s and 1650s in England were a time of great turmoil . The English Civil War led to the establishment of the Commonwealth of England and eventually the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell . In this period , Massachusetts was generally sympathetic to Cromwell and the Parliamentary cause . With the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660 , all of the colonies , and Massachusetts in particular , came under his scrutiny . In 1661 he issued a mandamus forbidding further persecution of the Quakers . He also requested specific changes to be made to Massachusetts laws to increase suffrage and tolerance for other Protestant religious practices , actions that were resisted or ignored during the Endecott administration . Charles finally sent royal commissioners to New England in 1664 to enforce his demands , but Massachusetts , of all the New England colonies , was the most recalcitrant , refusing all of the substantive demands or enacting changes that only superficially addressed the issues . 
 The reaction by Charles to this was to issue an order in 1666 demanding that Bellingham , since he was then governor , and William <unk> , the speaker of the general court , travel to England to answer for the colony 's behavior . The issue of how to answer this demand divided the colony , with petitions from a cross @-@ section of the colony 's population calling for the magistrates to obey the king 's demand . The debate also introduced a long @-@ term rift in the council of assistants between hardliners wanting to resist the king 's demands at all costs and moderates who thought the king 's demands should be accommodated . Bellingham sided with the hardliners and the decision was reached to send the king a letter . The letter questioned whether the request actually originated with the king , protested that the colony was loyal to him , and claimed the magistrates had already explained fully why they were unable to comply with the king 's demands . The magistrates further pacified the angered sovereign by sending over a ship full of masts as a gift ( New England was a valuable source of timber for the Royal Navy ) . Distracted by the war with the Dutch and domestic politics , Charles did not pursue the issue further until after Bellingham 's death , though for numerous reasons the Massachusetts Bay Colony charter was finally voided in 1684 . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Richard Bellingham died on 7 December 1672 . He was the last surviving signer of the colonial charter , and was buried in Boston 's Granary Burying Ground . He was survived by his son Samuel from his first marriage and his second wife Penelope , who outlived him by 30 years . His landholdings at Winnessimmett became tied up in legal action lasting more than 100 years , and involved court and procedural decisions on both sides of the Atlantic to resolve . Under the terms of his will , some of his properties in Winnessimmett were set aside for religious uses . His son challenged the will , which was eventually set aside . The litigation continued , carried on by his heirs and succeeding owners and occupants of the properties , and was finally concluded in 1785 . The town of Bellingham , Massachusetts is named in his honor , and a number of features in Chelsea , including a square , a street , and a hill , bear the name Bellingham . 
 Bellingham was immortalized as a fictional character in Nathaniel Hawthorne 's The Scarlet Letter , as the brother of Ann Hibbins , a woman who was executed ( in real life in 1656 , as well as in the book ) for practicing witchcraft . There are apparently no contemporary references to Mrs. Hibbins as Bellingham 's sister — Hawthorne 's formation of this connection appears to be based on a footnote in James Savage 's 1825 edition of John Winthrop 's journals , and a genealogical tree of the <unk> published early in the 20th century does not mention her . However , Ann Hibbins ' second husband , William Hibbins , was first married to Richard Bellingham 's sister Hester but she died a year later and was buried in England . Bellingham also appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow 's The New England Tragedies , which fictionalizes events dealing with the Quakers . 
 = Raid on Batavia ( 1806 ) = 
 The Raid on Batavia of 27 November 1806 was an attempt by a large British naval force to destroy the Dutch squadron based on Java in the Dutch East Indies that posed a threat to British shipping in the Straits of Malacca . The British admiral in command of the eastern Indian Ocean , Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Edward Pellew , led a force of four ships of the line , two frigates and brig to the capital of Java at Batavia ( later renamed Djakarta ) , in search of the squadron , which was reported to consist of a number of Dutch ships of the line and several smaller vessels . However the largest Dutch ships had already sailed eastwards towards Griessie over a month earlier , and Pellew only discovered the frigate Phoenix and a number of smaller warships in the bay , all of which were driven ashore by their crews rather than engage Pellew 's force . The wrecks were subsequently burnt and Pellew , unaware of the whereabouts of the main Dutch squadron , returned to his base at Madras for the winter . 
 The raid was the third of series of actions intended to eliminate the threat posed to British trade routes by the Dutch squadron : at the Action of 26 July 1806 and the Action of 18 October 1806 , British frigates sent on reconnaissance missions to the region succeeded in attacking and capturing two Dutch frigates and a number of other vessels . The raid reduced the effectiveness of Batavia as a Dutch base , but the continued presence of the main Dutch squadron at Griessie concerned Pellew and he led a second operation the following year to complete his defeat of the Dutch . Three years later , with the French driven out of the western Indian Ocean , British forces in the region were strong enough to prepare an expeditionary force against the Dutch East Indies , which effectively ended the war in the east . 
 = = Background = = 
 In early 1806 , Pellew was relieved by the news that a large French squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral Charles Linois had sailed out of the Indian Ocean and into the Atlantic . The departure of Linois after three years of operations in eastern waters freed Pellew 's small squadron based at Madras for operations against the Dutch East Indies . Pellew 's particular target was the island of Java , where the principal Dutch squadron and their base at Batavia were located . The Dutch Kingdom of Holland was a French client state under Emperor Napoleon 's brother Louis Bonaparte and Batavia had been used by Linois in his preparations for the Battle of Pulo Aura , in which a valuable British convoy came under attack , and its position close to the Straits of Malacca threatened British trade with China . 
 Pellew 's departure for the East Indies was delayed by the Vellore Mutiny in the spring , and instead he sent frigates to reconnoitre the situation of the Dutch forces in the region . In July , HMS Greyhound under Captain Edward Elphinstone cruised in the Molucca Islands and captured a Dutch convoy at the Action of 26 July 1806 off Celebes . Three months later another frigate , HMS Caroline under Captain Peter Rainier , cruised successfully in the Java Sea and managed to capture a Dutch frigate at the Action of 18 October 1806 from the entrance to Batavia harbour . Shortly before Rainier 's engagement , the principal ships of the Dutch squadron , the two ships of the line Pluto and Revolutie , had sailed westwards towards the port of Griessie , Rear @-@ Admiral Hartsinck seeking to divide his forces in preparation for the coming British attack to prevent their complete destruction . 
 Pellew sailed from Madras in the early autumn of 1806 , expecting the full Dutch squadron to be present and preparing accordingly with the ship of the line HMS Culloden under Captain Christopher Cole as his flagship , accompanied by HMS Powerful under Captain Robert Plampin , HMS Russell under Captain Thomas Gordon Caulfield and HMS Belliqueux under Captain George Byng . The ships of the line were accompanied by the frigate HMS Terpsichore under Captain Fleetwood Pellew , Admiral Pellew 's son , as well as the brig HMS <unk> under Lieutenant William Fitzwilliam Owen . 
 = = Pellew 's attack = = 
 By 23 November , Pellew 's squadron was approaching the Sunda Strait from the southwest when he encountered the British frigate HMS Sir Francis Drake , which he attached to his force . Three days later , the squadron passed the port of Bantam and seized the Dutch East India Company brig Maria Wilhelmina , continuing on to Batavia during the night . At the approaches to the port , the squadron separated , with the frigates and brig passing between Onrust Island and the shore while the ships of the line took a longer route through deeper water . Although Terpsichore was able to surprise and capture the corvette William near Onrust Island , the main body of the squadron was spotted by Dutch lookouts from a distance , who initially mistook the approaching vessels for a French squadron . The Dutch officers , led by Captain Vander Sande on the frigate Phoenix , decided that resistance against such a large British squadron was useless : the only warships remaining in the harbour were the Phoenix and six small armed ships , none of which could contend with the approaching British force . In an effort to dissuade the British from pressing their attack , the Dutch captains all drove their vessels ashore , joined by the 22 merchant vessels that were anchored in the harbour . 
 Determined to prevent the Dutch from refloating the grounded ships , Admiral Pellew ordered landing parties to assemble in the boats of his squadron alongside Terpsichore . From there , under distant covering fire from the British frigates , Fleetwood Pellew led the boats against Phoenix , coming under fire from the grounded vessels and gun batteries ashore . Passing through the bombardment from the shoreline , Pellew 's men boarded Phoenix to find that the Dutch crew had just abandoned the vessel , scuttling the frigate as they departed . Although now useless as a ship , Phoenix 's guns were turned on the other beached vessels to cover the British boats as they spread out to board and burn them . This operation was followed by the destruction of 20 grounded merchant ships in the harbour , although two others were successfully refloated and captured . In a final act before withdrawing to the squadron offshore , Captain Pellew set fire to the wreck of Phoenix , burning the ship to the waterline . The entire operation was conducted under heavy fire from the shore , but British casualties were only one Royal Marine killed and three men wounded . 
 Without sufficient troops to attempt a landing at Batavia itself , Admiral Pellew withdrew from the harbour . Preparing his prizes for the return to Madras , he ordered all prisoners taken from the captured and burnt ships returned to shore under condition of parole . The captured William was found to be in such a poor state of repair that it was not worth keeping the corvette and Admiral Pellew ordered the ship burnt , noting in his official report that Lieutenant Owen , who as senior lieutenant would otherwise have been placed in command , should be recompensed with another command as reward for his services in the engagement . With his preparations complete , Pellew then ordered his squadron to disperse , Culloden sailing to Malacca . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The British raid on Batavia had destroyed 28 vessels . In addition to Phoenix , William and the merchant ships , Pellew 's squadron had burnt the 18 @-@ gun brigs Aventurier and Patriot , the 14 @-@ gun Zee @-@ Ploeg , the 10 @-@ gun <unk> , the 8 @-@ gun Johanna Suzanna and the 6 @-@ gun <unk> . Just three ships were captured : two merchant vessels and Maria Wilhelmina . The elimination of the smaller vessels of the Dutch squadron was an important victory for Pellew , leaving only the larger ships of the line at large . These ships were old and in poor condition , limiting the threat they posed to British trade routes . Nevertheless , Pellew returned to the Java Sea in 1807 in search of the warships , destroying them at the Raid on Griessie in November , a year after the success at Batavia . A lack of resources in the region and the threat posed by the French Indian Ocean island bases delayed larger scale British operations against the East Indies until 1810 , when a series of invasions rapidly eliminated the remaining Dutch presence in the Pacific . 
 = Buffalo Grove ambush = 
 The Buffalo Grove ambush was an ambush that occurred on May 19 , 1832 as part of the Black Hawk War . A six @-@ man detail carrying dispatches from United States Colonel James M. Strode at Galena , Illinois to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon 's Ferry was ambushed by Native Americans during the attack . William Durley was killed and buried near the site of the ambush . Durley 's remains were initially interred by the party that would become victims of the St. Vrain massacre . Two other men had bullet holes in their clothing , but were uninjured . In 1910 the Polo Historical Society moved Durley 's remains to a plot beneath a memorial they erected west of Polo , Illinois . 
 = = Background = = 
 As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement , the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828 . However , Sauk Chief Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty , claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted , nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands . Angered by the loss of his birthplace , between 1830 – 31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River , but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed . In April 1832 , encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British , he again moved his so @-@ called " British Band " of around 1000 warriors and non @-@ combatants into Illinois . Finding no allies , he attempted to return to Iowa , but ensuing events led to the Battle of Stillman 's Run . A number of other engagements followed , and the state militias of Wisconsin and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk 's band . The conflict became known as the Black Hawk War . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 When the Black Hawk War began in the spring of 1832 , the settlers at Buffalo Grove were notified of Black Hawk 's victory at Stillman 's Run and ordered to leave the grove . Most of the settlers went to Peoria where they remained for the duration of the war . On May 19 , 1832 a small unit was detailed to carry dispatches from Colonel James M. Strode in Galena to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon 's Ferry ( present @-@ day Dixon , Illinois ) . The group of men , which included soldiers Fred Stahl , William Durley , Vincent Smith , Redding Bennett , James Smith , and mail contractor John D. Winters , left Dixon around 3 p.m. on May 19 . 
 = = Ambush = = 
 The Buffalo Grove ambush occurred near Buffalo Grove , Illinois , a small , unincorporated settlement in present @-@ day Ogle County . As the group neared the edge of the grove one of the party noted the increased chances for ambush and suggested that the party avoid the usual route by taking a more roundabout route . The suggestion was opposed and Durley reared his horse and entered the wooded area within the grove . He had traveled only a few " bounds " when he was cut down by gunfire from the previously suggested ambush . 
 On May 20 , 1832 , Sergeant Stahl returned to Dixon 's Ferry with the other four survivors of the attack and reported that his party had been ambushed by a group of Native Americans the evening before on the edge of the grove . He reported that Durley was killed instantly , scalped , and left on the spot . Stahl and James Smith both had bullets rip through articles of clothing but were uninjured and only Durley died in the attack . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The events of the Buffalo Grove ambush are closely interrelated with those of the St. Vrain massacre . A group of four men , including Aaron Hawley and John Fowler , both casualties of the St. Vrain massacre , was en route to Galena when they stumbled upon the body of Durley at Buffalo Grove . The group returned to Dixon 's Ferry , reported their find and stayed there overnight . 
 When Atkinson returned to Dixon on May 23 it was with dispatches destined for Fort Armstrong . He ordered Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain to join the group that had discovered Durley 's body and travel with them to Galena . The group left Dixon and traveled north where they found , and interred the remains of Durley at Buffalo Grove . 
 The Polo Historical Society erected a memorial to Durley on May 19 , 1910 , the 78th anniversary of the attack . At that time , Durley 's remains were moved from where St. Vrain 's party buried him , near where he had fallen , and interred beneath the memorial . The Buffalo Grove ambush historical marker and memorial to Durley are located west of the city of Polo , Illinois along Eagle Point Road . 
 = Mrs Beeton 's Book of Household Management = 
 Mrs Beeton 's Book of Household Management , also published as Mrs Beeton 's Cookery Book , is an extensive guide to running a household in Victorian Britain , edited by Isabella Beeton and first published as a book in 1861 . It had previously been published in parts . It was originally entitled Beeton 's Book of Household Management , as one of the series of guide @-@ books published by her husband , Samuel Beeton . The recipes were highly structured , in contrast to earlier cookbooks . It was illustrated with many monochrome and colour plates . 
 Although Mrs Beeton died in 1865 , the book continued to be a best @-@ seller . The first editions after her death contained an obituary notice , but this was removed from later editions , allowing readers to imagine that every word was written by an experienced Mrs Beeton personally . This fiction was expressed in one of Arthur Conan Doyle 's novels , where a character declares : " Mrs Beeton must have been the finest housekeeper in the world , therefore Mr. Beeton must have been the happiest and most comfortable man " . 
 Many of the recipes were copied from the most successful cookery books of the day including Eliza Acton 's Modern Cookery for Private Families , Elizabeth Raffald 's The Experienced English Housekeeper , Marie @-@ Antoine Carême 's Le Pâtissier royal parisien , Hannah Glasse 's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy , Maria Eliza Rundell 's A New System of Domestic Cookery , and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli . This practice of Mrs Beeton 's has in modern times repeatedly been described as plagiarism . 
 The book expanded steadily in length , until by 1907 it reached 74 chapters and over 2000 pages . Nearly two million copies were sold by 1868 , and it remains in print ( as of 2016 ) . Between 1875 and 1914 it was probably the most often consulted cookery book . Mrs Beeton has been compared on the strength of the book with modern domestic goddesses like Nigella Lawson and Delia Smith . 
 = = History = = 
 The author , Isabella Beeton , was 21 years old when she started working on the book . It was initially serialised in 24 monthly instalments , in her husband Samuel Orchart Beeton 's publication The Englishwoman 's Domestic Magazine ; the first instalment appeared in 1859 . On 1 October 1861 , the instalments were collected into one volume with the title The Book of Household Management , comprising information for the Mistress , Housekeeper , Cook , Kitchen @-@ Maid , Butler , Footman , Coachman , Valet , Upper and Under House @-@ Maids , Lady 's @-@ Maid , Maid @-@ of @-@ all @-@ Work , Laundry @-@ Maid , Nurse and Nurse @-@ Maid , Monthly Wet and Sick Nurses , etc. etc . — also Sanitary , Medical , & Legal Memoranda : with a History of the Origin , Properties , and Uses of all Things Connected with Home Life and Comfort . 
 In its preface she wrote : 
 I must frankly own , that if I had known , beforehand , that this book would have cost me the labour which it has , I should never have been courageous enough to commence it . What moved me , in the first instance , to attempt a work like this , was the discomfort and suffering which I had seen brought upon men and women by household mismanagement . I have always thought that there is no more fruitful source of family discontent than a housewife 's badly @-@ cooked dinners and untidy ways . 
 Beeton 's half @-@ sister , Lucy Smiles , was later asked about her memories of the book 's development . She recalled : 
 Different people gave their recipes for the book . That for Baroness pudding ( a suet pudding with a plethora of raisins ) was given by the Baroness de Tessier , who lived at Epsom . No recipe went into the book without a successful trial , and the home at Pinner was the scene of many experiments and some failures . I remember Isabella coming out of the kitchen one day , ' This won 't do at all , ' she said , and gave me the cake that had turned out like a biscuit . I thought it very good . It had currants in it . 
 Previously published as a part @-@ work , it was first published as a book in 1861 by S. O. Beeton Publishing , 161 Bouverie Street , London , a firm founded by Samuel Beeton . The book was an immediate best @-@ seller , selling 60 @,@ 000 copies in its first year and totalling nearly two million by 1868 . In 2010 a copy of the first edition of Household Management in " top condition " was stated to be worth more than £ 1 @,@ 000 . In 1863 a revised edition was issued . 
 In 1866 , a year after Isabella 's death , Samuel was in debt due to the collapse of Overend and Gurney , a London discount house to which he owed money . To save himself from bankruptcy he sold the copyright to all of his publications for a little over £ 19 @,@ 000 . Of that , the rights to Household Management were sold to publishers Ward , Lock and Tyler for £ 3 @,@ 250 . The early editions included an obituary notice for Beeton , but the publishers insisted it be removed " allowing readers to imagine – perhaps even as late as 1915 – that some mob @-@ capped matriarch was out there still keeping an eye on them " . 
 Revisions to Household Management by its publisher have continued to the present day . The effort has kept the Beeton name in the public eye for over 125 years , although current editions are far removed from those published in Mrs. Beeton 's lifetime . By 1906 the book had 2 @,@ 056 pages , " exclusive of advertising " , with 3 @,@ 931 recipes and was " half as large again " as the previous edition .

 = = = Contents = = = 
 The following description refers to the 1907 edition ; the book had been greatly extended in the decades since Mrs. Beeton 's death ( in 1865 ) to 74 chapters and over 2000 pages ; the first edition had 44 chapters . 
 The book begins with general chapters on the duties of the " mistress " , the housekeeper , and the cook . There follow chapters on the kitchen itself , " marketing " ( choosing good @-@ quality produce at the market ) , and an introduction to cookery ( Chapter 6 ) . Together , these take up over 100 pages . Chapters 7 to 38 ( roughly 1000 pages ) cover English cooking , with recipes for soups , <unk> , fish , meat ( principally veal , beef , mutton and lamb , and pork ) , poultry , game , preserves , vegetables , pastries , puddings , sweets , jams , pickles , and savouries . Chapter 39 describes the " art of carving at table " , supported by 11 illustrations . Chapters 40 to 50 ( some 200 pages ) give instructions for dairy products , vegetarian and invalid ( sick person ) cookery , making bread , biscuits and cakes , and beverages . Chapters 51 to 59 describe cooking in various international styles including French , German , Spanish , Jewish , Australian , South African , Indian , American and Canadian cookery . Chapters 60 to 68 provide guidance on matters from <unk> poultry to the definitions of culinary terms , arranging meals , decorating the table , making menus and the duties of domestic servants . Chapters 69 to 73 describe " household recipes " and medical preparations . The final chapter , 74 , offers " legal memoranda " . 
 There is a detailed index . The edition includes advertisements for products such as " <unk> " beef extract and " Cadbury 's Cocoa " . 
 = = = Approach = = = 
 The preface sets out the book 's goal of providing " men " with such well @-@ cooked food at home that it may compete with what they could eat " at their clubs , well @-@ ordered taverns , and dining @-@ houses " . Mrs. Beeton claims that 
 I have attempted to give , under the chapters devoted to cookery , an intelligible arrangement to every recipe , a list of the ingredients , a plain statement of the mode of preparing each dish , and a careful estimate of its cost , the number of people for whom it is sufficient , and the time when it is seasonable 
 She explains that she was thus attempting to make the basics of cookery " intelligible " to any " housewife " . 
 The first chapter sets the tone of the book with a quotation from the Book of Proverbs , and in early editions cites also The Vicar of Wakefield with 
 The modest virgin , the prudent wife , and the careful matron , are much more serviceable in life than <unk> philosophers , blustering heroines , or virago queens . She who makes her husband and her children happy , who reclaims the one from vice and trains up the other to virtue 
 The book thus advocates early rising , cleanliness , frugality , good temper , and the wisdom of interviewing servants rather than relying on written references . 
 Cookery is introduced with words about " the progress of mankind from barbarism to civilization " , with a mention of man " in his primitive state , [ living ] upon roots and the fruits of the earth " , rising to become in turn " a hunter and a fisher " ; then a " herdsman " and finally " the comfortable condition of a farmer . " It is granted that " the fruits of the earth , the fowls of the air , the beasts of the field , and the fish of the sea , are still the only food of mankind " , but that 
 these are so prepared , improved , and dressed by skill and ingenuity , that they are the means of immeasurably extending the boundaries of human enjoyments . The text then swiftly passes to a description of simple measures like a table @-@ spoonful , and the duties of servants . 
 The whole of the rest of the book is taken up with instructions for cooking , with an introduction in each chapter to the type of food it describes . The first of these , on soups , begins " Lean , juicy beef , mutton , and veal , form the basis of all good soups ; therefore it is advisable to procure those pieces which afford the richest succulence , and such as are fresh @-@ killed . " The account of how to make soup consists of a single essay , divided into general advice and numbered steps for making any kind of ( meat @-@ based ) soup . This is followed in early editions by a separate chapter of recipes for soups of different kinds . 
 Each recipe is structured into a title , a list of ingredients ( with quantities , either natural — as a number of eggs or vegetables , a number of slices of ham — or measured in Imperial units — ounces of salt , quarts of water . The actual instructions are headed " Mode " , as " Cut up the veal , and put it with the bones and trimmings of poultry " . A separate section gives the overall preparation time , and the average cost as , for example , " <unk> per quart " . Many recipes state in separate brief sections when a recipe is " <unk> " and for how many persons it is " Sufficient " . Finally , a " Note " gives any required advice , as " When stronger stock is desired , double the quantity of veal , or put in an old fowl . " This highly structured presentation was the book 's main innovation . 
 = = = Oddities = = = 
 Despite professing to be a guide of reliable information about every aspect of running a house for the aspirant middle classes , the original edition devotes 23 pages to household management , then discusses cooking for almost all of the other 900 . Even with the emphasis on food , some of her cooking advice is so odd as to suggest that she had little experience preparing meals . For example , the book recommends boiling pasta for an hour and forty @-@ five minutes . Like many other British people of her social class and generation , Mrs Beeton adopted a distaste for unfamiliar foods , saying that mangoes tasted like turpentine , lobsters were indigestible , garlic was offensive , potatoes were " suspicious ; a great many are narcotic , and many are deleterious " , cheese could only be consumed by sedentary people , and tomatoes were either good or bad for a range of reasons . 
 Unlike earlier cookbook authors , such as Hannah Glasse , the book offered an " emphasis on thrift and economy " . It also discarded the style of previous writers who employed " daunting paragraph [ s ] of text with ingredients and method jumbled up together " for what is a recognisably modern " user @-@ friendly formula listing ingredients , method , timings and even the estimated cost of each recipe " . 
 = = = Plagiarism = = = 
 In a critical letter , Mrs Beeton 's sister Mrs Henrietta Mary <unk> English advised her that " Cookery is a Science that is only learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course you have not had . Therefore my advice would be compile a book from receipts from a Variety of the Best Books published on Cookery and Heaven knows there is a great variety for you to choose from . " The recipes were largely copied from the most successful cookery books of the day , the copying in some cases acknowledged in the text . The " variety " included Eliza Acton 's Modern Cookery for Private Families and her The English Bread – Book , Elizabeth Raffald 's The Experienced English Housekeeper , Marie @-@ Antoine Carême 's Le Pâtissier royal parisien , Louis Eustache Ude 's The French Cook , Alexis Soyer 's The Modern Housewife or , Ménagère and The Pantropheon , Hannah Glasse 's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy , Maria Eliza Rundell 's A New System of Domestic Cookery , and the works of Charles Elmé Francatelli . 
 In modern times Mrs. Beeton 's practice has been criticised as plagiarism ; Beeton 's modern biographer Kathryn Hughes talks of her " lifting " and " brazenly copying " recipes from others , and says that this was " the way that cookery books had been put together from time immemorial ... " . The New York Times said , " Isabella [ Beeton ] plagiarised only the best " . This led to the comment that " Mrs Beeton couldn 't cook but she could copy " . Hughes recounts that Beeton 's " first recipe for Victoria sponge was so inept that she left out the eggs " and that her work was " brazenly copied ... almost word for word , from books as far back as the Restoration " . The influential 20th @-@ century food writer Elizabeth David dismissed her as " a plagiarist " and later wrote : " I wonder if I would have ever learned to cook at all if I had been given a routine Mrs Beeton to learn from " . 
 = = = Illustrations = = = 
 The 1907 edition runs to some 30 full @-@ page colour plates , and over 100 full @-@ page illustrations in monochrome . These include photographs , such as of the housekeeper standing with hands behind her back in her kitchen ( pictured ) , facing the first page of Chapter 2 , " The Housekeeper " . An idea of the amount of detail may be gained from the fact that there are 11 illustrations of types of fish ( one pictured ) , such as " steamed sole " and " soused mackerel " , and another of " fish entrées " . 
 One full @-@ page colour plate ( pictured ) illustrated a range of puddings , showing jelly , raspberry cream , a centre dish piled high with fruits , a trifle , and an ornamental flowerpot containing a strawberry plant . 
 Another full @-@ page colour plate ( pictured ) showed a variety of fruits including apricots , white and black cherries , white , red and black currants , a melon , strawberries and varieties of plums , all piled high on circular dishes or fruit stands .

 The preface of Wilhelmina Rawson 's Queensland Cookery and Poultry Book ( 1878 ) , published in Australia , observes that : " Mrs Lance Rawson 's Cookery Book ... is written entirely for the Colonies , and for the middle classes , and for those people who cannot afford to buy a Mrs Beeton or a Warne , but who can afford the three shillings for this . " 
 The Oxford English Dictionary recognised that , by the 1890s , Beeton 's name " was adopted as a term for an authority on all things domestic and culinary " . The Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science observed that " it was probably found in more homes than any other cookery book , and [ was probably ] the most often consulted , in the years 1875 to 1914 " . 
 A chapter of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's novel A Duet , with an Occasional Chorus ( 1899 ) is entitled , " Concerning Mrs. Beeton " ; a character declares : " Mrs Beeton must have been the finest housekeeper in the world , therefore Mr. Beeton must have been the happiest and most comfortable man " . 
 = = = Modern = = = 
 Mrs Beeton has been described as " the grandmother of modern domestic goddesses " , like Nigella Lawson and Delia Smith , who saw , as Beeton did , the need to provide reassuring advice on culinary matters for the British middle classes . However , while Lawson and Smith " insist that cooking can be easy , fun and uncomplicated " , Beeton " acknowledges the labour and skill required to cook well " . 
 The food writer and chef Gerard Baker tested and revised 220 of Beeton 's recipes , and published the result as Mrs. Beeton : How To Cook ( 2011 ) . 
 For the book 's 150th anniversary in 2011 the Royal Society of Chemistry planned to feature one of Beeton 's recipes . Due to the financial climate at the time in wake of the Great Recession , the Society selected Beeton 's toast sandwich , a dish that Beeton included to cater to the less well @-@ off . 
 In 2012 the food economist for the British television period drama Downton Abbey described Beeton 's book as an " important guide " for the food served in the series .

 = Matangi = 
 Matangi is one of the Mahavidyas , ten Tantric goddesses and a ferocious aspect of Devi , the Hindu Divine Mother . She is considered to be the Tantric form of Sarasvati , the goddess of music and learning . Like Sarasvati , Matangi governs speech , music , knowledge and the arts . Her worship is prescribed to acquire supernatural powers , especially gaining control over enemies , attracting people to oneself , acquiring mastery over the arts and gaining supreme knowledge . 
 Matangi is often associated with pollution , inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society , which is embodied in her most popular form , known as Ucchishta @-@ Chandalini or Ucchishta @-@ Matangini . She is described as an outcaste ( Chandalini ) and offered left @-@ over or partially eaten food ( Ucchishta ) with unwashed hands or food after eating , both of which are considered to be impure in classical Hinduism . 
 Matangi is often represented as emerald green in colour . While Ucchishta @-@ Matangini carries a noose , sword , goad , and club , her other well @-@ known form , Raja @-@ Matangi , plays the veena and is often pictured with a parrot . 
 = = Iconography and textual descriptions = = 
 The Dhyana mantra ( a mantra that details the form of the deity on which a devotee should meditate ) of the <unk> Tantrasara describes Ucchishta @-@ Matangini , one of the most popular forms of the goddess . Matangi is seated on a corpse and wears red garments , red jewellery and a garland of <unk> seeds . The goddess is described as a young , sixteen @-@ year @-@ old maiden with fully developed breasts . She carries a skull and a sword in her two hands , and is offered leftovers . 
 The Dhyana mantras in the Purashcharyarnava and the Tantrasara describe Matangi as blue in colour . The crescent moon adorns her forehead . She has three eyes and a smiling face . She wears jewellery and is seated on a jewelled throne . In her four arms , she carries a noose , a sword , a goad , and a club . Her waist is slim and her breasts well @-@ developed . 
 The Dhyana Mantra of Raja @-@ <unk> from the Purashcharyarnava describes Matangi as green in colour with the crescent moon upon her forehead . She has long hair , a smiling expression and intoxicated eyes , and wears a garland of <unk> flowers and various ornaments . She <unk> a little around the face , which renders her even more beautiful . Below her navel are three horizontal folds of skin and a thin vertical line of fine hair . Seated on an altar and flanked by two parrots , she represents the 64 arts . The <unk> , adds to this description that Raja @-@ Matangi plays the veena , wears conch @-@ shell earrings and flower garlands , and has flower paintings adorning her forehead . 
 According to the <unk> , Matangi plays a ruby @-@ studded veena and speaks sweetly . The Dhyana Mantra describes her to be four @-@ armed , with a dark emerald complexion , full breasts anointed with red kumkum powder , and a crescent moon on her forehead . She carries a noose , a goad , a sugarcane bow and flower arrows , which the goddess Tripura Sundari is often described to hold . She is also described to love the parrot and is embodied in the nectar of song . 
 The green complexion is associated with deep knowledge and is also the colour of Budha , the presiding deity of the planet Mercury who governs intelligence . Matangi is often depicted with a parrot in her hands , representing speech . The veena symbolizes her association with music . 
 = = Legends = = 
 Matangi is often named as the ninth Mahavidya . A list contained within the prose of the Mundamala equates Vishnu 's ten avatars with the ten Mahavidyas . The Buddha is equated to Matangi . A similar list in the Guhyatiguhya @-@ Tantra omits Matangi altogether , however the scholar Sircar interprets the goddess Durga – equated to the avatar Kalki in the list – as an allusion to Matangi . 
 In a story from the Shakta Maha @-@ Bhagavata Purana , which narrates the creation of all the Mahavidyas , Sati , the daughter of Daksha and first wife of god Shiva , feels insulted that she and Shiva are not invited to Daksha 's yagna ( " fire sacrifice " ) and insists on going there , despite Shiva 's protests . After futile attempts to convince Shiva , the enraged Sati transforms into the Mahavidyas , including Matangi . The Mahavidyas then surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions ; Matangi stands in the northwest . Another similar legend replaces Sati with Kali ( the chief Mahavidya ) as the wife of Shiva and the origin of Matangi and the other Mahavidyas . The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes Matangi and her fellow Mahavidyas as war @-@ companions and forms of the goddess Shakambhari . 
 The Shaktisamgama @-@ tantra narrates the birth of Ucchishta @-@ matangini . Once , the god Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi visited Shiva and his second wife Parvati ( a reincarnation of Sati ) and gave them a banquet of fine foods . While eating , the deities dropped some food on the ground , from which arose a beautiful maiden who asked their left @-@ overs . The four deities granted her their left @-@ overs as prasad , food made sacred by having been first consumed by the deity . This can be interpreted as the Ucchishta of the deity , although due to its negative connotation the word Ucchishta is never explicitly used in connection to prasad . Shiva decreed that those who repeat her mantra and worship her will have their material desires satisfied and gain control over foes , declaring her the giver of boons . From that day , the maiden was known as Ucchishta @-@ matangini . 
 The Pranotasani Tantra narrates that once Parvati longed to go back to her maternal house for some days and asked Shiva 's permission to do so . The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days , he would come to fetch her . Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya 's place , where she stayed for many days . The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya 's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati . In order to test her fidelity , the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return . The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament @-@ seller , when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva . She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time . In the evening , Parvati returns to Shiva 's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress . She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him . She told Shiva that she had come to do penance . Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and took her hand and kissed her . Further , they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife . After the love @-@ making , Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini ( the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her ) might last forever as Ucchishta @-@ Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful . This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas . In these texts , however , Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi . 
 The <unk> @-@ tantra mentions that Matanga practised austerities for thousands of years to gain the power to subdue all beings . Finally , goddess Tripura Sundari appeared and from eyes emitted rays that produced goddess Kali , who had greenish complexion and was known as Raja @-@ matangini . With her help , Matanga fulfilled his desire . Many texts including the <unk> describe Matangi as the daughter of the sage Matanga . 
 Another tale is associated with the temple dedicated to Kauri @-@ bai — an aspect of Matangi — who appeared in low caste area of Varanasi . Kauri @-@ bai was a goddess who was obsessed with the Brahmin ways and purity and abhorred Shiva 's heterodox practices like dwelling in cremation grounds , partaking of intoxicants and being in the company of ghosts and goblins . While Shiva simply ignored Kauri @-@ bai 's words at first , after his marriage his wife Parvati could not bear Kauri @-@ bai 's abusive words toward her husband and cursed Kauri @-@ bai to be reborn in and spend her entire lifetime within an " untouchable " area of Varanasi which Kauri @-@ bai considered polluted . Consequently , Kauri @-@ bai was indeed reborn in the low @-@ caste area of Varanasi and felt very unhappy . She pleaded Shiva — the Lord of Varanasi — who granted her the boon that no pilgrimage to Varanasi would be deemed complete without her worship .

 Matangi is often associated with pollution , especially left @-@ over or partially eaten food ( Ucchishta or <unk> , <unk> ् <unk> ् <unk> ) considered impure in Hinduism . She is often offered such polluted left @-@ over food and is in one legend described to be born from it . Matangi is herself described as the leftover or residue , symbolizing the Divine Self that is left over after all things perish . As the patron of left @-@ over food offerings , she embodies inauspiciousness and the forbidden transgression of social norms . 
 Matangi is often described as an outcaste and impure . Her association with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities , considered to be polluted in Hindu society . These social groups deal in occupations deemed inauspicious and polluted like collection of waste , meat @-@ processing and working in cremation grounds . In a Nepali context , such groups are collectively called Matangi , who collect waste — including human waste — and other inauspicious things , and often live outside villages . Thus she is associated with death , pollution , inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society . 
 Matangi is also associated with forests and tribal peoples , who lie outside conventional Hindu society . Her thousand @-@ name hymn from the <unk> @-@ tantra mentions epithets that describe her as dwelling in , walking in , knowing and relishing the forest . 
 Matangi represents the power of the spoken word ( <unk> ) as an expression of thoughts and the mind . She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought . Besides spoken word , she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge , like art , music and dance . Matangi presides over the middle part of speech ( <unk> ) , where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role , represents Para @-@ <unk> — the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures . She is described as the goddess of learning and speech , and the bestower of knowledge and talent . She is also called <unk> , the mistress of the sacred mantras . She also represents the word of a guru , who serves as a spiritual guide . Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra — the origin of speech — and on the tip of the tongue . She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue . According to David Frawley , her description as impure refers to the nature of the spoken word , which labels things and stereotypes them , thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things . The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge , which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition . 
 Matangi is regarded as a Tantric form of Sarasvati , the goddess of knowledge and the arts of mainstream Hinduism , with whom she shares many traits . Both embody music and are depicted playing the veena . They are also both said to be the Nada ( sound or energy ) that flows through the Nadi channels in the body through which life force flows . Both are related to rain clouds , thunder and rivers . Though both govern learning and speech , Sarasvati represents the orthodox knowledge of the Brahmins while Matangi — the wild and ecstatic outcast — embodies the " extraordinary " beyond the boundaries of mainstream society , especially inner knowledge . Matangi is also associated with Ganesha , the elephant @-@ headed god of knowledge and obstacle removal . Both are related to the elephant and learning . Matangi is also sometimes regarded as his consort . Matangi is also described as a minister of the Mahavidya goddess Tripura Sundari or <unk> , the Queen of Queens . 
 = = Worship = = 
 Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi , Matangi is the other Mahavidya , whose worship is primarily prescribed to acquire supernatural powers . A hymn in the Maha @-@ bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one 's foes , while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra , meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself . Her devotees , especially Tantric <unk> , are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left @-@ over or partially eaten food ( Ucchishta ) and thus overcome their ego . Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution , leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals . The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee 's queries by whispering in her ear . 
 Matangi is often worshipped with the mantra syllable Aim , which is associated with Sarasvati and is the seed @-@ syllable of knowledge , learning and teaching . A longer mantra of twenty syllables is also used : 
 Om <unk> aim <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 sri <unk> <unk> svaha 
 " Reverence to adorable Matangi , the outcast and residue , who gives control over all creatures " 
 Her mantra may be repeated ten thousand times , repeated one thousand times while offering flowers and ghee in a fire sacrifice , or repeated one hundred times while offering water ( <unk> ) or while offering food to Brahmin priests . Her yantra ( sacred geometric diagram ) , whether physically constructed or mentally envisioned , is used in worship along with the mantra . Offering certain items to a fire sacrifice — particularly those performed at cremation grounds , river banks , forests , or crossroads — while repeating the mantra is said to fulfil specific goals . An offering of <unk> leaves is said to result in kingship ; salt gives the power to control ; turmeric gives the power to paralyse ; neem twigs bring wealth ; and an offering of sandalwood , camphor and saffron together or a salt and honey mixture grants the power to attract people . A rice @-@ flour bread prepared while repeating her mantra is said to give the power to attract women . It is likewise said that it is possible to make a person one 's slave by feeding him or her the ashes of a crow whose stomach was stuffed with a conch and burnt in a cremation ground while repeating the goddess ' mantra . 
 Leftover or partially eaten food ( Ucchishta ) is recommended to be offered to Matangi with the devotee in the polluted Ucchishta state , that is , having eaten but not washed , with the remains of food in the mouth and hands . Offering of leftovers to Hindu deities or being in the polluted Ucchishta state is a taboo in mainstream Hinduism . Another taboo that is broken in Matangi worship is the offering to the goddess of a cloth stained with menstrual blood to gain the ability to attract a mate . Menstrual blood is considered polluted in almost all Hindu scriptures and menstruating women are kept away from Hindu worship and temples . The outcaste Matangi community of Nepal collect polluted substances and items related to death and bad luck such as sacrificial animal heads and clothes of the deceased , and offers them at special stones kept at crossroads called <unk> , where the " dangerous " Matangi " consumes " them as an offering , thereby getting rid of the pollution . The Tantrasara also advises offerings to Matangi of meat , fish , cooked rice , milk and incense at crossroads or cremations grounds in the dead of the night to overpower enemies and gain poetic talent . <unk> of Ucchishta , cat meat and goat meat to the goddess are said to help achieve Supreme knowledge . A text proclaims Matangi 's worship becomes fruitful only if the devotee reveres women as goddesses and refrains from criticizing them . 
 No fasts or rituals to purify oneself before worship — typical of Hindu worship — are prescribed for Matangi worship . Anyone can use any mantra for worship , even though he is not initiated or considered unfit for worshipping any other deity . A thousand @-@ name hymn from the <unk> @-@ tantra and a hundred @-@ name hymn from the <unk> are dedicated to the goddess . The reciting of the Sanskrit alphabet , the chanting of mantras , the reading aloud of the scriptures , and performance of music and dance are also described as constituting acts of her worship .

 " Si j 'avais au moins ... " ( English : " If I Had at Least ... " ) is a song recorded by French singer Mylène Farmer . This pop rock ballad was written by Farmer with music composed by Laurent Boutonnat . It was the third single released , from her seventh studio album Point de suture ( 2008 ) , on 16 February 2009 . Directed by Bruno Aveillan , the accompanying music video is the continuation of Farmer 's previous single " <unk> " and is the last part of a short film called The Farmer Project , broadcast in January 2009 . In the video , the singer portrays a supernatural character who saves animals from testing and heals them . Although a survey showed that a minority of the voters wanted the song as the third single , " Si j 'avais au moins ... " received positive reviews and achieved some success on the French Singles Chart , debuting at number @-@ one . Farmer performed the song on television during the NRJ Music Awards show on 17 January 2009 and on the 2009 Mylène Farmer en <unk> tour .

 On 15 December 2008 , recording company Polydor officially announced that " Si j 'avais au moins ... " as the next single from the album Point de suture ( 2008 ) while simultaneously a promotional format was released on radio stations . This format contained a radio edit version , in which the last refrain of the original song , before the musical bridge , was deleted . Many fans were disappointed by this choice , as demonstrated by the results of a survey published on the website <unk> which showed that only 1 @.@ 7 % of the voters wanted the song as the third single . Charles <unk> of <unk> deemed this release a " surprising decision " which recalled the choice of the ballad " <unk> @-@ moi " as the third single from her previous album Avant que l 'ombre ... ( 2005 ) . As the song has a very slow tempo , author Erwan Chuberre deemed that Farmer made " an artistic rather than a commercial choice " when she decided to release the song as a single . 
 On 15 January 2009 , it was announced that the maxi vinyl , published in a limited edition , and the CD single would be released on 10 February , then delayed to 16 February . The cover art of the promotional single was entirely red , showing a close @-@ up , the head of the doll which had appeared on Point de suture . The cover of the single , which published on the internet on 27 January 2009 , displayed a photograph by Simon Hawk .

 According to the author Benoît Cachin , " Si j 'avais au moins ... " deals with the absence of a loved being , which causes an unbearable but trainer pain . Like in " <unk> @-@ moi " , the lyrics use the lexical field of a " ghost which haunts the singer 's mind " , include some references to religion and the neologism <unk> . 
 = = Music video = = 
 Directed by Bruno Aveillan , the music video was filmed in mid @-@ 2008 in an abandoned hospital in Prague . It premiered on the internet on 7 January 2009 , and was officially released on television on M6 , ten days later . The music video was shot just after " <unk> " , the first single from Point de suture , as both music videos are parts of a short film named The Farmer Project . 
 The video starts with Farmer slowly walking in an laboratory in which many animals are captive to serve as experiments . Depicting a supernatural creature , the singer approaches every cage to look at all the animals — pigeons , cats , bobcats , rabbits , <unk> , a snake , an owl , a monkey , a doe — and heals them with her magic hands . Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders . During the second refrain , she remains standing with closed eyes in the middle of the room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages . She thus releases the animals and , with a monkey in her arms , leads them outside into the woods . Standing in the forest , she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands . The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light . 
 According to Lionel <unk> , " Mylène [ was ] very professional , thorough , discreet and almost shy " when she participated in the shooting of the video . He said she had to be careful not to get scratched by the cat , and that the final scene was difficult to film because the cats were afraid of the water used in this scene , the rats remained hidden in a corner and the birds did not fly much . Given that the song deals with the pain caused by the absence of a dead person , the video is unrelated to the lyrics , as noted by author Alice Novak . In reviews , Yahoo ! Music said that , through the video , " [ Farmer ] invites us into her dark and magical universe " , and Premiere deemed it " mysterious , provocative " . Considering it a short film , Cachin praised the music video as being " perfectly done " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Si j 'avais au moins ... " , reviewed after the album 's release , was generally well received in the media . Swiss newspaper Le Matin said it was a " <unk> ballad " and one of the best songs of the album ; as for Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic , he qualified " Si j 'avais au moins ... " and " Point de suture " as " standout ballads made of uplifting string arrangements and delicate vocal melodies " . Novak deemed the song " sweet and sad " . La Meuse considered it a " ballad with a strong <unk> connotation " . 
 In France , " Si j 'avais au moins ... " charted poorly on radio , peaking at number 60 on the airplay chart in its second week , on 19 December 2008 . In contrast , the music video was regularly broadcast on television , reaching number five on the TV airplay chart in its third week . On the singles chart , the song debuted at number one on the chart edition of 21 February 2009 , selling 12 @,@ 375 units that week , and thus became the singer 's seventh number one single in France , which , at the time , was a record . The week after , the song ranked at number five , and weekly sales dropped to 3 @,@ 072 ; thereafter , it continued to drop and remained 27 weeks in the top 50 and 38 weeks in the top 100 , which remains the third longest chart trajectory of Farmer 's single in France . In Belgium ( Wallonia ) , the single entered the Ultratop 50 at number 25 on 28 February 2009 , then dropped to number 38 . In Switzerland , it charted for one week , at number 72 , on 1 March 2009 . The song began at a peak of number six on the chart edition of 7 March 2009 on the European Hot 100 Singles , which was the highest debut then .

 Willie Gillis , Jr . ( more commonly simply Willie Gillis ) is a fictional character created by Norman Rockwell for a series of World War II paintings that appeared on the covers of eleven issues of The Saturday Evening Post between 1941 and 1946 . With the rank of private , Gillis was an everyman whose career was tracked on the cover of the Post from induction through discharge without being depicted in battle . Gillis and his girlfriend were modeled by two of Rockwell 's acquaintances . 
 Although Gillis was not exclusively used on Post covers , the Willie Gillis series of covers was a hallmark of Rockwell 's wartime work . In Rockwell 's prime and at the peak of its popularity , The Post had a <unk> of 4 million , and many of these subscribers believed Gillis was a real person . Rockwell 's wartime art , including Willie Gillis , the Four Freedoms and Rosie the Riveter , contributed to the success of the wartime bond sales efforts . 
 Since 1999 , the Gillis series has been included in two major Rockwell tours . From 1999 – 2002 it toured as part of a Rockwell Post cover art retrospective . From 2006 – 2010 it is touring as part of a 1940s World War II Rockwell art exhibition . 
 = = Background = = 
 From 1916 through his Kennedy Memorial cover on December 16 , 1963 , Rockwell created 321 magazine covers for The Post , which was the most popular American magazine of the first half of the 20th century with a <unk> that reached a peak of 4 million . Rockwell illustrated American life during World War I and World War II in 34 of his cover illustrations , and he illustrated 33 Post covers in total during World War II . Some of the war art involved American life . During much of the first half of the 1940s , Rockwell 's cover illustrations focused on the human side of the war . Rockwell encouraged support of the war efforts during World War II via his covers which endorsed war bonds , encouraged women to work , and encouraged men to enlist in the service . His World War II illustrations used themes of patriotism , longing , shifting gender roles , reunion , love , work , community and family during wartime to promote the war . In his role as a magazine illustrator during times of war , Rockwell draws comparisons to Winslow Homer , an American Civil War illustrator for Harper 's Weekly . Rockwell 's artistic expressions were said to have helped the adoption of the goal of the Four Freedoms as set forth by United States President Franklin Roosevelt 's 1941 State of the Union Address . His painting series , the Four Freedoms , toured in a war bond effort that raised $ 132 million . 
 Willie Gillis was a freckle @-@ faced All @-@ American character who served as one of Rockwell 's main <unk> during World War II . The Gillis character is widely referred to as an everyman who epitomized the typical American World War II Soldier . Rockwell created Gillis in 1940 as the European Theatre of World War II was escalating and Americans were enlisting or being drafted under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 in the armed forces . Rockwell credits the name Willie Gillis to his wife , who derived it from an old children 's book , Wee Willie Winkie . Rockwell described Gillis as " an inoffensive , ordinary little guy thrown into the chaos of war . " The public identified with Rockwell 's portrayal of the " little guy " living up to a sense of duty in this time of war . Gillis was truly seen as the typical G.I. , and Rockwell 's wartime art remains quite popular : his signed original May 29 , 1943 depiction of Rosie the Riveter sold at a Sotheby 's auction on May 22 , 2002 for $ 4 @,@ 959 @,@ 500 . Some of the Willie Gillis paintings and the Rosie the Riveter painting were raffled off during the United States Department of the Treasury 's Second War Loan Drive , which ran from April 12 – May 1 , 1943 . The Gillis character endures generations later for literary and artistic comparison .

 In Willie Gillis : Food Package , Gillis ' 1941 , he toted a care package . Ten subsequent covers depicted Gillis in a variety of roles : at church in uniform , holding his hat on his lap ; soldier on K.P. duty ; the son carrying on the family tradition of military service ; a still life of Gillis ' family photographs ; and two fighting mad girls , holding pictures of Gillis that he 'd sent each of them from the war zone . Gillis matured over the course of the series until he was almost unrecognizable in the final work . Rockwell created a good ending for the series by depicting Gillis relaxing while studying at college on the G.I. Bill : " We know that things ended well for Gillis , though ; his final cover in 1946 showed the young man stretched in a windowsill smoking a pipe and wearing penny loafers , studying at Middlebury College . " 
 To some , the fourth piece – Willie Gillis : Hometown News – was the one that cemented Willie Gillis ' place in American history , because families identified with Gillis . The sixth piece , Willie Gillis in Church , is the earliest of his works with significant religious themes . This final component of the series , Willie Gillis in College , engenders much critical review because it is perceived to represent a transformation of character . It is owned by the Washington Mutual Bank of Seattle . In 2000 , they loaned it to the University of Wisconsin – Madison . It is a study in contrast of mood and style from the wartime components of the series . Throughout the cover series Gillis was never pictured in battle or in any sort of danger , armed or with armed foes because Rockwell felt those portrayals were better exhibited by newsreels and photographs . 
 Rockwell produced at least one depiction of Gillis that was not on the cover . The painting Willie Gillis in Convoy was produced in 1943 , depicting Gillis , in combat gear , in the back of a covered military vehicle with his rifle in hand . Rockwell donated the painting to the Gardner High School for the graduating class , where it hung in the principal 's office until 2000 . The school then loaned it to the Gardner Museum . A charcoal sketch of the painting sold for $ 107 @,@ 000 in 1999 . There was concern that the painting was not hung in a secure location . In 2005 , the painting was restored and rehung at the high school .

 Robert Otis " Bob " Buck served as Rockwell 's model for Gillis and eventually enlisted for service in the United States Navy . Buck 's job in Arlington was as a sawmill hand . When the 15 @-@ year @-@ old Buck met Rockwell to pose for the first time , Buck only stood 5 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 63 m ) tall . At that time , Buck had a lock of hair that used to drop down on his forehead . Rockwell had been seeking a model , and met Buck at a square dance in Arlington , Vermont . Rockwell observed Buck from different angles during the dance , and Buck told Rockwell that if he did not stop staring , Buck would knock him flat . 
 Buck had been exempted from the military draft , but he felt serving his country was his patriotic duty and enlisted as a naval aviator in 1943 . Buck served in the South Seas during the war . Once Buck enlisted , Rockwell worked from memory and photographs to complete his illustrations , and sometimes he only worked Gillis into the background via a photograph on the wall . Rockwell was going to discontinue the series , but Post editors objected because his character was too popular . The public enjoyed closely scrutinizing Gillis ' affairs . Gillis was so popular that at one point , the Post was receiving hundreds of letter inquiring about the tribulations of the character who was perceived by many as real , and concern for the private was particularly high among families named Gillis . 
 Although Buck had departed , the model who portrayed Gillis ' girlfriend ( fellow Post illustrator Mead Schaeffer 's daughter ) remained available , so Rockwell painted her faithfully sleeping at midnight on New Year 's Eve with photos of Willie Gillis in the background above her bed in Willie Gillis : New Year 's Eve . The subsequent 11 inches ( 280 mm ) × 14 inches ( 360 mm ) Willie Gillis cover , Willie Gillis : Generations , depicting the Gillis military family in pictures above a bookshelf of Gillis war books , generated hundreds of letters from <unk> , many of whom wanted to buy the imaginary books . Mead 's daughters Lee and Patty Schaeffer showed vying affections for Gillis in one Post cover .

 " An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig " is the fifth episode in the first season of the American animated television series South Park . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on September 10 , 1997 . In the episode , the boys of South Park try to force Kyle 's pet elephant to crossbreed with Cartman 's pet pig for a class project on genetic engineering . Meanwhile , Stan tries to deal with his sister Shelley , who keeps beating him up . 
 The episode was written by series co @-@ creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone along with Dan Sterling . The episode served as both a parody of genetic engineering and a statement against its potential evils . The scenes of Stan getting beat up by his sister were inspired by Parker 's real @-@ life childhood experiences with his own sister , who is also named Shelley . 
 " An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig " was met with generally positive reviews , and has been described as one of the most popular early South Park episodes . Several commentators praised its satirical elements with regard to genetic engineering . The episode marked the first appearance of Shelley Marsh , Stan 's mother Sharon Marsh , and the mad scientist Dr. Mephesto , who was inspired by the title character of the 1996 film , The Island of Dr. Moreau . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The boys are waiting at the bus stop when Cartman notices Stan has a black eye and it turns out his sister Shelley has been beating him up . Kyle has problems of his own ; his mom will not let him keep his new pet elephant in the house . At school , Mr. Hat teaches the class about genetic engineering , which prompts Kyle to decide to crossbreed his elephant with Cartman 's pot @-@ bellied pig , Fluffy , to make little " pot @-@ bellied elephants " , which he could keep in his house . Upon hearing this , Terrance Mephesto bets Kyle that he can clone a whole person before Kyle can create a pot @-@ bellied elephant . Mr. Garrison suggests the boys use their genetic modifications for the upcoming science fair and go to the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch . 
 At the ranch , Dr. Mephesto shows them his genetically engineered collection , including several different animals with four pairs of buttocks , such as a monkey , ostrich and mongoose . Mephesto then explains that , just like the Loverboy song says , " pig and elephant DNA just won 't splice " , and steals a blood sample from Stan and the boys leave . At school the boys learn Terrance has cloned a human foot . The boys go to Chef with their genetic engineering problem , and after he too cites the Loverboy song , he gives them the idea to try to have the animals " make sweet love " to breed . 
 Meanwhile , back at the ranch , Mephesto and his assistant Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance . The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate , but it does not seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with a little help from Elton John . The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto 's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town . The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan 's house and convince it to attack Shelley ; however , it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny , by flinging him into a microwave , with a chair . Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone , but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did . However , in a brief moment of kindness , Shelley takes the blame , after which she beats up Stan . 
 When the science projects are due , Terrance presents a monkey with five pairs of buttocks , but Kyle has nothing until the pig gives birth to a pot @-@ bellied pig that looks like Mr. Garrison , implying the pig was impregnated by Mr. Garrison before the elephant . Garrison quickly awards it first prize over Terrance 's monkey .

 " An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig " was written by show creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone , and Dan Sterling . It first aired on September 10 , 1997 , in the United States on Comedy Central . Parker and Stone intended to call this episode " An Elephant <unk> a Pig " , but changed the title under pressure from Comedy Central . The network also made them cut a scene in which Shelley sets Stan on fire to keep the show from coming under the same fire for showing dangerous acts that can easily be imitated as MTV 's Beavis and Butt @-@ Head and later , MTV 's Jackass . It was during the writing of this episode that Parker and Stone decided Kyle would be the good student and " school @-@ smarter than the other kids " . 
 The subplot with Stan getting beat up by his sister Shelley came from Parker 's real @-@ life experiences getting beat up as a child by his sister , also named Shelley , who is three years his elder . Parker said although his sister would later deny it , she regularly beat him up or locked him out of the house for hours ; Parker stated that the scene when Stan says " You 're my sister and I love you " in order to try to avoid a beating , but was subsequently beat even harder , was based on an actual experience with his sister . The scene in which Stan asks the giant mutant Stan to attack Shelley is based on Parker 's childhood fantasy of having a larger version of himself beat up his sister . The resolution to the subplot , in which Shelley takes the blame for Stan 's mistakes , and then beats up Stan when he tries to thank her , was also based on experiences Parker had when his sister would bail him out of trouble . 
 The dialogue spoken by the giant mutant Stan was inspired by a mentally handicapped character in the MTV show How 's Your News ? , which Parker and Stone produced ; according to Parker and Stone , the character could only say phrases like " Bubba chop , <unk> chewy <unk> " , and both men took turns voicing mutant Stan to sound the same way . Isaac Hayes , who does the voice of Chef , recorded all his lines via phone from New York ; Parker and Stone said they were nervous to ask him to repeat the line , " Now I know how all those white women felt " , but he had no problem repeating it . The genetic mutations Dr. Mephesto creates , including the animals with multiple asses and the goldfish with bunny ears , were inspired by things Parker drew during high school . 
 The scene in the cafeteria , in which the four boys are annoyed by Pip , is a cut scene from the original version of the South Park pilot , " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe " ; as such , the animation in that individual scene is actually traditional paper cutout stop motion , while the animation throughout the rest of the episode is done with computers . In order to illustrate the aftermath after the destruction scenes , Parker and Stone smudged the paper sets with their fingerprints and stains to make them look like scorch burns .

 The Baltimore Sun writer Tamara <unk> equated the episode as both a parody of genetic engineering and a statement against its potential evils , particularly through in its portrayal of the giant mutant Stan wreaking havoc through South Park . This episode marked the first appearances of the characters Shelley and Sharon Marsh , Stan 's sister and mother respectively , as well as that of Dr. Mephesto . Dr. Mephesto is based on Marlon Brando 's character Dr. Moreau in the 1996 film , The Island of Dr. Moreau , which is based on the 1896 H.G. Wells novel of the same name . Mephesto is named after Mephistopheles , the demon in the Faust legend . Kevin , the companion of Dr. Mephesto , is based on the small creature who resembles and dresses like a miniature version of Brando 's character in the 1996 film The Island of Dr. Moreau . 
 Elton John , the English singer and songwriter , appears as a guest vocalist for Chef 's song , in one of the earliest celebrity spoof appearances on South Park ; Trey Parker , who provided the voice for Elton John , said many people thought it was the actual John singing because his impression was so accurate . In another musical reference featured in the episode , several characters claim the real @-@ life Canadian rock group Loverboy wrote a song about the fact that the DNA of an elephant and pig will not splice . " An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig " includes several pop cultural references to films and television shows . The last line in the episode , " That 'll do pig " , spoken by Cartman , is a reference to the final line of the 1995 film Babe , a movie about a talking pig , which Stone has described as one of his favorite films . When the boys try to tell Officer Barbrady about the clone , he suggests that the boys have seen too many episodes of the X @-@ Files . In the scene in which Pip is introduced , Stan asks Pip about his peculiar name , but Cartman interrupts Pip during his answer . Pip 's reply – " my father 's family name being <unk> and my Christian name Phillip , my infant <unk> " – is identical to the opening line of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations , which is narrated by its protagonist , Pip . The fourth season episode " Pip " is a parody and comedic retelling of the novel , and stars Pip , who assumes the role of his namesake .

 Several media outlets described " An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig " as one of the most popular early South Park episodes . Tom Carson of Newsday said it was the most outrageous South Park episode until " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " aired three months later . Many reviewers said the mere title demonstrated the crudeness and originality of South Park , then still a relatively new show . Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News said , " With episode titles such as , ' An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig , ' suffice it to say there ain 't much on the air like it . " 
 Tamara <unk> of The Baltimore Sun said the episode demonstrated the show 's ability to address ethically challenging issues like genetic engineering with an " imaginative , unconventional flair " . The Melbourne , Australia @-@ based newspaper , The <unk> said the episode " ( pushes ) a degree of political incorrectness that is so extreme and <unk> it is almost unavoidably funny . " Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times praised the episode , and said the bestiality hinted at in the final scene of the episode illustrated the outrageousness of the show , as well as the fact that the show would probably not be enjoyed by all audiences . 
 Rick Bentley of The Fresno Bee said the biggest laughs from the episode come from the song Chef sings to the elephant and pig . In 2008 , Alicia Wade of the Daily Egyptian said the episode and its theme about genetic engineering still felt fresh more than 10 years after its original broadcast . In 2009 , Travis Fickett from IGN rated this episode an 8 @.@ 3 out of 10 , and concluded about it that " It 's a bit shocking , perhaps offensive to some , but in the context of murdering mutants and five @-@ assed monkeys created by Brando parodies in Hawaiian moo @-@ <unk> – it all makes perfect sense .

 = Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty = 
 The Byzantine Empire or Byzantium is the term conventionally used by historians to describe the Greek ethnic and speaking Roman Empire of the Middle Ages , centered on its capital of Constantinople . Having survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire during Late Antiquity , the Byzantine Empire continued to function until its conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . 
 In the context of Byzantine history , the period from about 1081 to about 1185 is often known as the Komnenian or <unk> period , after the Komnenos dynasty . Together , the five Komnenian emperors ( Alexios I , John II , Manuel I , Alexios II and Andronikos I ) ruled for 104 years , presiding over a sustained , though ultimately incomplete , restoration of the military , territorial , economic and political position of the Byzantine Empire . 
 As a human institution , Byzantium under the Komnenoi played a key role in the history of the Crusades in the Holy Land , while also exerting enormous cultural and political influence in Europe , the Near East , and the lands around the Mediterranean Sea . The Komnenian emperors , particularly John and Manuel , exerted great influence over the Crusader states of Outremer , whilst Alexios I played a key role in the course of the First Crusade , which he helped bring about . 
 Moreover , it was during the Komnenian period that contact between Byzantium and the ' Latin ' Christian West , including the Crusader states , was at its most crucial stage . Venetian and other Italian traders became resident in Constantinople and the empire in large numbers ( 60 – 80 @,@ 000 ' Latins ' in Constantinople alone ) , and their presence together with the numerous Latin mercenaries who were employed by Manuel in particular helped to spread Byzantine technology , art , literature and culture throughout the Roman Catholic west . Above all , the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west at this period was enormous and of long lasting significance . 
 The Komnenoi also made a significant contribution to the history of Asia Minor . By reconquering much of the region , the Komnenoi set back the advance of the Turks in Anatolia by more than two centuries . In the process , they planted the foundations of the Byzantine successor states of Nicaea , Epirus and Trebizond . Meanwhile , their extensive programme of fortifications has left an enduring mark upon the Anatolian landscape , which can still be appreciated today . 
 = = Crisis and fragmentation = = 
 The Komnenian era was born out of a period of great difficulty and strife for the Byzantine Empire . Following a period of relative success and expansion under the Macedonian dynasty ( c . 867 – c . 1054 ) , Byzantium experienced several decades of stagnation and decline , which culminated in a vast deterioration in the military , territorial , economic and political situation of the Byzantine Empire by the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081 . 
 The problems the empire faced were partially caused by the growing influence and power of the aristocracy , which weakened the empire 's military structure by undermining the theme system that trained and administered its armies . Beginning with the death of the successful soldier @-@ emperor Basil II in 1025 , a long series of weak rulers had disbanded the large armies which had been defending the eastern provinces from attack ; instead , gold was stockpiled in Constantinople , ostensibly in order to hire mercenaries should troubles arise . In fact , most of the money was given away in the form of gifts to favourites of the emperor , extravagant court banquets , and expensive luxuries for the imperial family . 
 Meanwhile , the remnants of the once @-@ formidable armed forces were allowed to decay , to the point where they were no longer capable of functioning as an army . Elderly men with ill @-@ maintained equipment mixed with new recruits who had never participated in a training exercise . 
 The simultaneous arrival of aggressive new enemies – Turks in the east and Normans in the west – was another contributory factor . In 1040 , the Normans , originally landless mercenaries from northern parts of Europe in search of plunder , began attacking Byzantine strongholds in southern Italy . In order to deal with them , a mixed force of mercenaries and conscripts under the formidable George Maniakes was sent to Italy in 1042 . Maniakes and his army conducted a brutally successful campaign , but before it could be concluded he was recalled to Constantinople . Angered by a series of outrages against his wife and property by one of his rivals , he was proclaimed emperor by his troops , and led them across the Adriatic to victory against a loyalist army . However , a mortal wound led to his death shortly afterwards . With opposition thus absent in the Balkans , the Normans were able to complete the expulsion of the Byzantines from Italy by 1071 . 
 Despite the seriousness of this loss , it was in Asia Minor that the empire 's greatest disaster would take place . The Seljuk Turks , although mainly concerned with defeating Egypt under the Fatimids , nevertheless conducted a series of damaging raids into Armenia and eastern Anatolia – the main recruiting ground for Byzantine armies . With imperial armies weakened by years of insufficient funding and civil warfare , Emperor Romanos Diogenes realised that a time of re @-@ structuring and re @-@ equipment was necessary . Consequently , he attempted to lead a defensive campaign in the east until his forces had recovered enough to defeat the Seljuks . However , he suffered a surprise defeat at the hands of Alp Arslan ( Sultan of the Seljuk Turks ) at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . Romanos was captured , and although the Sultan 's peace terms were fairly lenient , the battle in the long term resulted in the total loss of Byzantine Anatolia . 
 On his release , Romanos found that his enemies had conspired against him to place their own candidate on the throne in his absence . After two defeats in battle against the rebels , Romanos surrendered and suffered a horrific death by torture . The new ruler , Michael Doukas , refused to honour the treaty that had been signed by Romanos . In response , the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073 ; the collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition . To make matters worse , chaos reigned as the empire 's remaining resources were squandered in a series of disastrous civil wars . Thousands of Turkoman tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia . By 1080 , an area of 30 @,@ 000 square miles ( 78 @,@ 000 km2 ) had been lost to the empire . 
 = = Alexios I Komnenos = = 
 After Manzikert , a partial recovery was made possible due to the efforts of the Komnenian dynasty . This is sometimes referred to as the Komnenian restoration . The first emperor of this royal line was Alexios I Komnenos ( whose life and policies would be described by his daughter Anna Komnene in the Alexiad ) . Alexios 's long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle . At his accession in 1081 , the Byzantine Empire was in chaos after a prolonged period of civil war resulting from the defeat at Manzikert . 
 At the very outset of his reign , Alexios had to meet the formidable threat of the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemond of Taranto , who took Dyrrhachium and Corfu , and laid siege to Larissa in Thessaly ( see Battle of Dyrrhachium ) . Alexios led his forces in person against the Normans , yet despite his best efforts his army was destroyed in the field . Alexios himself was wounded , but the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085 led to the Norman danger receding for a time . 
 However , Alexios 's problems were only just beginning . At a time when the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire , taxation and the economy were in complete disarray . Inflation was spiralling out of control , the coinage was heavily debased , the fiscal system was confused ( there were six different nomismata in circulation ) , and the imperial treasury was empty . In desperation , Alexios had been forced to finance his campaign against the Normans by using the wealth of the Eastern Orthodox Church , which had been put at his disposal by the Patriarch of Constantinople . 
 In 1087 , Alexios faced a new invasion . This time the invaders consisted of a horde of 80 @,@ 000 Pechenegs from north of the Danube , and they were heading for Constantinople . Without enough troops to repel this new threat , Alexios used diplomacy to achieve a victory against the odds . Having bribed the Cumans , another barbarian tribe , to come to his aid , he advanced against the Pechenegs , who were caught by surprise and annihilated at the Battle of Levounion on 28 April 1091 . 
 With stability at last achieved in the west , Alexios now had a chance to begin solving his severe economic difficulties and the disintegration of the empire 's traditional defences . In order to reestablish the army , Alexios began to build a new force on the basis of feudal grants ( <unk> ) and prepared to advance against the Seljuks , who had conquered Asia Minor and were now established at Nicaea . 
 Despite his improvements , Alexios did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor . Having been impressed by the abilities of the Norman cavalry at Dyrrhachium , he sent ambassadors west to ask for reinforcements from Europe . This mission was deftly accomplished – at the Council of Piacenza in 1095 , Pope Urban II was impressed by Alexios 's appeal for help , which spoke of the suffering of the Christians of the east and hinted at a possible union of the eastern and western churches . Pope Urban was concerned with increasing restlessness of the martial nobility in Western Europe , who , currently deprived of major enemies , were causing chaos throughout the countryside . Alexios 's appeal offered a means not only to redirect the energy of the knights to benefit the Church , but also to consolidate the authority of the Pope over all Christendom and to gain the east for the See of Rome . 
 = = = First Crusade = = = 
 On 27 November 1095 , Urban II called together the Council of Clermont in France . There , amid a crowd of thousands who had come to hear his words , he urged all present to take up arms under the banner of the Cross and launch a holy war to recover Jerusalem and the east from the ' infidel ' Muslims . <unk> were to be granted to all those who took part in the great enterprise . Many promised to carry out the Pope 's command , and word of the Crusade soon spread across western Europe . 
 Alexios had anticipated help in the form of mercenary forces from the West , and was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived , to his consternation and embarrassment . The first group , under Peter the Hermit , he sent to Asia Minor , ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements . However , the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants . As they marched on Nicaea in 1096 , they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man . 
 The second , " official " host of knights , led by Godfrey of Bouillon , Alexios also sent into Asia , promising to supply them with provisions in return for an oath of loyalty . They were accompanied by the Byzantine general Tatikios . By their victories , Alexios was able to recover for the Byzantine Empire a number of important cities and islands : Nicaea , Chios , Rhodes , Smyrna , Ephesus , Philadelphia , Sardis , and in fact much of western Asia Minor ( 1097 – 1099 ) . This is ascribed by his daughter Anna to his policy and diplomacy , but good relations were not to last . The crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch ( he had in fact set out on the road to Antioch , but had been persuaded to turn back by Stephen of Blois , who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed ) . Bohemund , who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch , briefly went to war with Alexios , but agreed to become Alexios 's vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108 . 
 = = = Recovery = = = 
 Despite his many successes , during the last twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity . This was largely due to the harsh measures he was forced to take in order to save the embattled empire . Conscription was introduced , causing resentment among the peasantry , despite the pressing need for new recruits to the imperial army . In order to restore the imperial treasury , Alexios took measures to tax the aristocracy heavily ; he also cancelled many of the exemptions from taxation that the church had previously enjoyed . In order to ensure that all taxes were paid in full , and to halt the cycle of debasement and inflation , he completely reformed the coinage , issuing a new gold hyperpyron ( highly refined ) coin for the purpose . By 1109 , he had managed to restore order by working out a proper rate of exchange for the whole coinage . His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years . 
 The final years of Alexios 's reign were marked by persecution of the followers of the Paulician and Bogomil heresies — one of his last acts was to burn at the stake the Bogomil leader , Basil the Physician , with whom he had engaged in a theological controversy ; by renewed struggles with the Turks ( 1110 – 1117 ) ; and by anxieties as to the succession , which his wife Irene wished to alter in favour of her daughter Anna 's husband <unk> Bryennios , for whose benefit the special title panhypersebastos ( " honored above all " ) was created . This intrigue disturbed even his dying hours . 
 Nevertheless , despite the unpopularity of some of his measures , Alexios 's efforts had been vital to the survival of the empire . Financially and militarily bankrupt , and facing wave after wave of foreign invasion , the empire he inherited had been on the point of collapse . His long struggle to protect and restore the strength of the empire had been exhausting , but Alexios 's successors inherited a viable state with both the internal stability and the military and financial resources , to expand in the future . 
 = = Restoration under John II Komnenos = = 
 Alexios 's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118 , and was to rule until 1143 . On account of his mild and just reign , he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius . John was unusual for his lack of cruelty — despite his long reign , he never had anyone killed or blinded . He was loved by his subjects , who gave him the name ' John the Good ' . He was also an energetic campaigner , spending much of his life in army camps and personally supervising sieges . 
 During John 's reign , Byzantium faced many difficulties : enemies confronted the empire on all sides . An invasion of nomadic horsemen from the north threatened Byzantine control in the Balkans , and the Turks were harassing Byzantine territory in Asia Minor . However , John soon proved himself just as determined and energetic as his predecessor . At the Battle of <unk> , John personally led the imperial armies against the Pecheneg invaders . With the aid of the emperor 's elite troops , the Varangian Guard , the tribal horsemen were decisively crushed . The emperor 's victory was so emphatic that the Pechenegs soon disappeared as an independent people . 
 John 's marriage to the Hungarian princess Piroska involved him in the dynastic struggles of the Kingdom of Hungary . In giving asylum to Álmos , a blinded claimant to the Hungarian throne , John aroused the suspicion of the Hungarians . The Hungarians , led by Stephen II , then invaded Byzantium 's Balkan provinces in 1127 , with hostilities lasting until 1129 The Hungarians attacked Belgrade , Nish and Sofia ; John , who was near Philippopolis in Thrace , counterattacked , supported by a naval flotilla operating on the Danube . After a challenging campaign , the details of which are obscure , the emperor managed to defeat the Hungarians and their Serbian allies at the fortress of Haram or <unk> , which is the modern Nova Palanka . Following this the Hungarians renewed hostilities by attacking Braničevo , which was immediately rebuilt by John . Further Byzantine military successes , Choniates mentions several engagements , resulted in a restoration of peace . The Danube frontier had been definitively secured . 
 John was then able to concentrate on Asia Minor , which became the focus of his attention for most of his reign . The Turks were pressing forward against the Byzantine frontier , and John was determined to drive them back . Thanks to John 's energetic campaigning , Turkish attempts at expansion in Asia Minor were halted , and John prepared to take the fight to the enemy . In order to restore the region to Byzantine control , John led a series of campaigns against the Turks , one of which resulted in the reconquest of the ancestral home of the <unk> at Kastamonu . He quickly earned a formidable reputation as a wall @-@ breaker , taking stronghold after stronghold from his enemies . Regions which had been lost to the empire since Manzikert were recovered and garrisoned . Yet resistance , particularly from the Danishmends of the north @-@ east , was strong , and the difficult nature of holding down the new conquests is illustrated by the fact that Kastamonu was recaptured by the Turks whilst John was back in Constantinople celebrating its return to Byzantine rule . John persevered , and Kastamonu soon changed hands once more . He advanced into north @-@ eastern Anatolia , provoking the Turks to attack his army . Unlike Romanos Diogenes , John 's forces were able to maintain their cohesion , and the Turkish attempt to inflict a second Manzikert on the emperor 's army backfired when the Sultan , discredited by his failure , was murdered by his own people . 
 John , like Basil II before him , was a slow but steady campaigner . His armies made careful , measured gains over time , rarely exposing themselves to excessive risks , but nevertheless advancing inexorably towards their objectives . However , the Turks were resilient , and they did not allow themselves to be decisively defeated in any one engagement . They knew that it was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time , as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention . 
 John consolidated his conquests and the existing Byzantine holdings in Asia by the building of a series of forts . Historian Paul Magdalino explains this process in his book The empire of Manuel Komnenos by placing it in the context of the Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine empire as a whole ; he points out that while John 's father Alexios had fortified places on the coast , John now expanded Byzantine control into the interior by fortifying places such as Lopadion , <unk> and Laodicea , which guarded the approaches to the valleys and coastlands of Asia Minor . This restoration of order under John enabled agricultural prosperity to begin a recovery that would eventually restore these war torn regions to their former status as a productive and valuable part of the Byzantine empire . 
 Towards the end of his reign , John made a concerted effort to secure Antioch . On the way , he captured the southern coast of Asia Minor and Cilicia . He advanced into Syria at the head of his veteran army , which had been seasoned by a lifetime of campaigning . Although John fought hard for the Christian cause in the campaign in Syria , there was a famous incident where his allies , Prince Raymond of Antioch and Count Joscelin II of Edessa , sat around playing dice while John pressed the Siege of Shaizar . These Crusader Princes were suspicious of each other and of John , and neither wanted the other to gain from participating in the campaign , while Raymond also wanted to hold on to Antioch which he had agreed to hand over to John if the campaign was successful . Ultimately , Joscelin and Raymond conspired to keep John out of Antioch , and while he was preparing to lead a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and a further campaign , he accidentally grazed his hand on a poison arrow while out hunting . The poison set in and shortly afterwards he died . 
 Historian J. Birkenmeier has recently argued that John 's reign was the most successful of the Komnenian period . In " The development of the Komnenian army 1081 – 1180 " , he stresses the wisdom of John 's approach to warfare , which focused on siege warfare rather than risky pitched battles . Birkenmeier argues that John 's strategy of launching annual campaigns with limited , realistic objectives was a more sensible one than that followed by his son Manuel I. According to this view , John 's campaigns benefited the Byzantine Empire because they protected the empire 's heartland from attack while gradually extending its territory in Asia Minor . The Turks were forced onto the defensive , while John kept his diplomatic situation relatively simple by allying with the Western Emperor against the Normans of Sicily . 
 Overall , John II Komnenos left the empire a great deal better off than he had found it . Substantial territories had been recovered , and his successes against the invading Petchenegs , Serbs and Seljuk Turks , along with his attempts to establish Byzantine suzerainty over the Crusader States in Antioch and Edessa , did much to restore the reputation of his empire . His careful , methodical approach to warfare had protected the empire from the risk of sudden defeats , while his determination and skill had allowed him to rack up a long list of successful sieges and assaults against enemy strongholds . By the time of his death , he had earned near universal respect , even from the Crusaders , for his courage , dedication and piety . His early death meant his work went unfinished ; historian Zoe <unk> speculates that his last campaign might well have resulted in real gains for Byzantium and the Christian cause . 
 = = Manuel I Komnenos = = 
 John 's chosen heir was his fourth son , Manuel I Komnenos . According to Niketas Choniates , a historian of Byzantium , Manuel was chosen over his elder surviving brother because of his ability to listen carefully to advice . Manuel was known for his lively and charismatic personality ; he was known for his love for all things from Western Europe . Manuel arranged jousting matches , even participating in them , an unusual experience for the Byzantines . Manuel himself is generally considered the most brilliant of the four emperors of the Komnenos dynasty ; unusual for a Byzantine ruler , his reputation was particularly good in the west and the Crusader states , especially after his death . The Latin historian William of Tyre described Manuel as " beloved of God ... a great @-@ souled man of incomparable energy " , [ whose ] " memory will ever be held in benediction " . Manuel was further extolled by Robert of Clari as a " generous and worthy man " . 
 Manuel dedicated himself to restore the glory of his empire and to regaining superpower status . His foreign policy was both ambitious and expansive , reaching out to all corners of the Mediterranean world . He made several alliances with the Pope and Western Christian kingdoms , and successfully handled the passage of the potentially dangerous Second Crusade through his empire , establishing a Byzantine protectorate over the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer . 
 Manuel campaigned aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east ; facing Muslims in Palestine , he allied himself with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and sent a large fleet to participate in a combined invasion of Fatimid Egypt . In an effort to restore Byzantine control over the ports of southern Italy , he sent an expedition to invade Italy in 1155 . Operating as part of a coalition of Byzantine , rebel , and Papal forces , Manuel 's armies achieved initial success . However , disputes within the coalition led to the expedition 's eventual failure . Despite this military setback Manuel was undeterred , and his armies successfully invaded the Kingdom of Hungary in 1167 , defeating the Hungarians at the Battle of Sirmium . He was highly successful in the Balkans and Hungary ; historian Paul Magdalino argues that no emperor had dominated the region so effectively since Late Antiquity . 
 In the east , however , Manuel 's achievements are more ambiguous . He suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176 against the Turks . Manuel was marching against Konya , the Turkish capital , when his forces were ambushed ; the ensuing defeat has since entered the popular imagination as a legendary disaster . Exaggerated accounts of the battle often describe the destruction of the entire Byzantine army , and with it the end of Byzantine power and influence . However , the modern consensus among Byzantine historians is that , while the Battle of Myriokephalon was a serious humiliation for the emperor , it was certainly not a catastrophe . Nor was it in any way equivalent to the Battle of Manzikert over a century earlier . In fact , much of the emperor 's army emerged from the battle without serious damage . Units involved in the battle are well documented as campaigning in Asia Minor the following year . The imperial frontier remained unmoved for the remainder of Manuel 's reign , a clear indication that the Turks were unable to gain any advantage from their victory . In 1177 the Byzantines inflicted a major defeat on a large Turkish force at Hyelion and Leimocheir in the Meander valley . 
 Manuel 's programme of fortification in Byzantine Asia , for which he was praised by Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates , is largely regarded as an important success . Manuel demanded tribute from the Turkmen of the Anatolian interior for the winter pasture in Imperial territory ; he also improved the defenses of many cities and towns , and established new garrisons and fortresses across the region . As a result of the cumulative efforts of all three Komnenian emperors , Manuel 's domination of Asia Minor was more effective than that of any emperor since before Manzikert . As historian Paul Magdalino makes clear , " by the end of Manuel 's reign , the Byzantines controlled all the rich agricultural lowlands of the peninsula , leaving only the less hospitable mountain and plateau areas to the Turks . " 
 In the religious sphere , disputes between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church occasionally harmed efforts at cooperation with the Latins ; however , Manuel was almost certainly the Byzantine emperor who came closest to healing the breach between the two churches . Pope Innocent III clearly had a positive view of Manuel when he told Alexios III that he should imitate " your outstanding predecessor of famous memory the emperor Manuel ... in devotion to the Apostolic See , both in words and in works " . 
 Manuel was very successful in expanding his influence , particularly over the Crusader states . As an example , he participated in the building and decorating of many of the basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land , including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem where due to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day . All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states , with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald , Prince of Antioch , and Amalric , King of Jerusalem . This success in gaining influence and allies among the western states and the Pope is regarded one of the most impressive achievements of Manuel Komnenos 's reign . 
 = = Military reform = = 
 At the beginning of the Komnenian period in 1081 , the Byzantine Empire had been reduced to the smallest territorial extent in its history . Surrounded by enemies , and financially ruined by a long period of civil war , the empire 's prospects had looked grim . Yet , through a combination of determination , military reform , and years of campaigning , Alexios I Komnenos , John II Komnenos and Manuel I Komnenos managed to restore the power of the Byzantine Empire . An important factor in the success of the Komnenoi was their establishment of a reconstructed Byzantine army . The new military system which they created is known as the Komnenian army . From c . 1081 to c . 1180 , the Komnenian army played an important role in providing the empire with a period of security that enabled Byzantine civilization to flourish . 
 The new force was both professional and disciplined . It contained formidable guards units such as the Varangian Guard , the ' Immortals ' ( a unit of heavy cavalry ) stationed in Constantinople and the <unk> , recruited by Alexios from the sons of dead Byzantine officers , and also levies from the provinces . These levies included <unk> cavalry from Macedonia , Thessaly and Thrace , and various other provincial forces such as Trebizond Archers from the Black Sea coast of Asia Minor and the <unk> , a cavalry unit recruited from Christianised Magyars from the Vardar valley . Alongside troops raised and paid for directly by the state , the Komnenian army included the armed followers of members of the wider imperial family and its extensive connections . In this can be seen the beginnings of the feudalisation of the Byzantine military . The granting of pronoia holdings , where land was held in return for military obligations , was beginning to become a notable element in the military infrastructure towards the end of the Komnenian period , though it became much more important subsequently . In 1097 , the Byzantine Army numbered around 70 @,@ 000 men altogether . By the closing years of the 1180 @-@ era , and the death of Manuel Komnenos , whose frequent campaigns had been on a grand scale the army was probably considerably larger . During the reign of Alexius I , the field army numbered around 20 @,@ 000 men which was increased to about 30 @,@ 000 men in John II 's reign . By the end of Manuel I 's reign the Byzantine field army had risen to 40 @,@ 000 men . 
 Under John II , a Macedonian division was maintained , and new native Byzantine troops were recruited from the provinces . As Byzantine Asia Minor began to prosper under John and Manuel , more soldiers were raised from the Asiatic provinces of <unk> , Paphlagonia and even Seleucia ( in the south east ) . Soldiers were also drawn from defeated peoples , such as the Pechenegs ( cavalry archers ) , and the Serbs , who were used as settlers stationed at Nicomedia . Native troops were organised into regular units and stationed in both the Asian and European provinces . Komnenian armies were also often reinforced by allied contingents from Antioch , Serbia and Hungary , yet even so they generally consisted of about two @-@ thirds Byzantine troops to one @-@ third foreigners . Units of archers , infantry and cavalry were grouped together so as to provide combined arms support to each other . The emperor Manuel I was heavily influenced by Westerners ( both of his queens were ' Franks ' ) and at the beginning of his reign he re @-@ equipped and retrained his native Byzantine heavy cavalry along Western lines . It is inferred that Manuel introduced the couched lance technique , the close order charge and increased the use of heavier armour . Manuel personally took part in ' knightly ' tournaments in the Western fashion , where his considerable prowess impressed Western observers . Permanent military camps were established in the Balkans and in Anatolia , these are first described during the reign of John II . The main Anatolian camp was near Lopadion on the <unk> River near the Sea of Marmora , the European equivalent was at <unk> in Thrace , others were at Sofia ( Serdica ) and at Pelagonia , west of Thessalonica . These great military camps seem to have been an innovation of the Komnenian emperors and may have played an important part in the improvement in the effectiveness of the Byzantine forces seen in the period . The camps were used as transit stations for the movement of troops , as concentration points for field armies , for the training of troops and for the preparation of armies for the rigours of campaign . 
 = = Twelfth century ' Renaissance ' = = 
 It has recently been argued that a ' 12th century renaissance ' occurred in Byzantium . Although the term does not enjoy widespread usage , it is beyond doubt that 12th century Byzantium witnessed major cultural developments , which were largely underpinned by rapid economic expansion . 
 The 12th century was a time of significant growth in the Byzantine economy , with rising population levels and extensive tracts of new agricultural land being brought into production . Archaeological evidence from both Europe and Asia Minor shows a considerable increase in the size of urban settlements , together with a ‘ notable upsurge ’ in new towns . In Athens the medieval town experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth , starting in the eleventh century and continuing until the end of the twelfth century . Thessaloniki , the second city of the Empire , hosted a famous summer fair which attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls . In Corinth , silk production fuelled a thriving economy . In Asia Minor , some areas had become depopulated due to Turkish raiding in the late eleventh century . Yet as the Komnenian emperors built up extensive fortifications in rural areas during the twelfth century , repopulation of the countryside took place . 
 Overall , given that both population and prosperity increased substantially in this period , economic recovery in Byzantium appears to have been strengthening the economic basis of the state . This helps to explain how the Komnenian emperors , Manuel Komnenos in particular , were able to project their power and influence so widely at this time . 
 The new wealth being generated during this period had a positive impact on Byzantine cultural life . In artistic terms , the twelfth century was a very productive period in Byzantine history . There was a revival in the mosaic art , and regional schools of Architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences . 
 According to N. H. Baynes in Byzantium , An Introduction to East Roman Civilization , 
 = = Andronikos I Komnenos and the fall of the Komnenoi = = 
 Manuel 's death on 24 September 1180 , marked a turning point in the fortunes of the Byzantine Empire . When Manuel died , he was succeeded by his young son Alexios II Komnenos , who was under the guardianship of the empress Maria . Her conduct excited popular indignation , and the consequent disorders , amounting almost to civil war , gave an opportunity to the ambition of Manuel 's estranged cousin , Andronikos I Komnenos ( r . 1183 – 1185 ) , son of Isaac Komnenos . Andronikos left his retirement in 1182 , and marched on Constantinople with an army that ( according to non @-@ Byzantine sources ) included Muslim contingents . His arrival was soon followed by a massacre of the Latin inhabitants , which was focused on the Venetian merchants who were settled in some numbers in Constantinople . He was believed to have arranged the poisoning of Alexios II 's elder sister Maria the <unk> and her husband Renier of Montferrat , although Maria herself had encouraged him to intervene . The poisoner was said to be the eunuch <unk> . Soon afterwards he had the empress Maria imprisoned and then killed , by <unk> and the hetaireiarches Constantine <unk> . Alexios II was compelled to acknowledge Andronikos as colleague in the empire , but was then put to death ; the killing was carried out by <unk> , Theodore <unk> and Stephen Hagiochristophorites . Andronikos , by 1183 sole emperor , married Agnes of France , a child twelve years of age who had been formerly betrothed to Alexios II . Agnes was a daughter of King Louis VII of France and his third wife Adèle of Champagne . By November 1183 , Andronikos associated his younger legitimate son John Komnenos on the throne . 
 Andronikos Komnenos was a man of astounding contrasts . Handsome and eloquent , the new emperor was at the same time known for his licentious exploits . Energetic , able and determined , Andronikos was a true Komnenos . However , he was also capable of terrifying brutality , violence and cruelty . 
 Andronikos began his reign well ; in particular , the measures he took to reform the government of the empire have been praised by historians . In the provinces , Andronikos ' reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement . Andronikos 's fierce determination to root out corruption and many other abuses was admirable ; under Andronikos , the sale of offices ceased ; selection was based on merit , rather than favouritism ; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery . Every form of corruption was eliminated with ferocious zeal . 
 The people , who felt the severity of his laws , at the same time acknowledged their justice , and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors . Andronikos 's energetic efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry . However , his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic . The aristocrats were infuriated with him , and to make matters worse , Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged ; executions and violence became increasingly common , and his reign turned into a reign of terror . Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole . The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter , as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime . 
 There were several revolts , leading to an invasion by King William II of Sicily . On September 11 , 1185 , during his absence from the capital , Stephen Hagiochristophorites moved to arrest Isaac Angelos , whose loyalty was suspect . Isaac killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of Hagia Sophia . He appealed to the populace , and a tumult arose which spread rapidly over the whole city . 
 When Andronikos arrived , he found that his authority was overthrown : Isaac had been proclaimed emperor . The deposed Emperor attempted to escape in a boat with his wife Agnes and his mistress , but was captured . Isaac handed him over to the city mob and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment . His right hand was cut off , his teeth and hair were pulled out , one of his eyes was gouged out , and , among many other sufferings , boiling water was thrown in his face . At last , led to the Hippodrome of Constantinople , he was hung up by the feet between two pillars , and two Latin soldiers competed as to whose sword would penetrate his body more deeply . He died on September 12 , 1185 . At the news of the emperor 's death , his son and co @-@ emperor , John , was murdered by his own troops in Thrace . 
 Andronikos I was the last of the Komnenoi to rule Constantinople , although his grandsons Alexios and David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204 . Nevertheless , Andronikos 's role in the collapse of the empire is controversial ; historians disagree over the extent to which his brief reign influenced events after his death . <unk> 's coup , together with his violent death , had weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely . Furthermore , his so @-@ called ' anti @-@ Latin ' policy has been criticised by some historians as a failure , in view of the increasing hostility it caused towards Byzantium in the west . In particular , <unk> 's failure to prevent the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182 has been seen as especially significant , since henceforth Byzantine foreign policy was invariably perceived as sinister and anti @-@ Latin in the west . It has even been argued that Andronikos 's attempts to crush the aristocracy were damaging to the empire 's military power , since the aristocracy had become indispensable to the defences of the state . On the other hand , his reforms in the provinces were both wise and beneficial to the internal health and prosperity of the empire . 
 The Komnenian period was followed by the dynasty of the Angeloi , who oversaw perhaps the most crucial period in the Decline of the Byzantine Empire . The next quarter of a century would see Constantinople fall to an invading force for the first time in its history , and the final loss of the empire 's ' great power ' status . However , with the death of Andronikos , the Komnenian dynasty , having lasted 104 years , had finally come to an end . 
 = Lawrencium = 
 Lawrencium is a synthetic chemical element with chemical symbol Lr ( formerly Lw ) and atomic number 103 . It is named in honor of Ernest Lawrence , inventor of the cyclotron , a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements . A radioactive metal , lawrencium is the eleventh transuranic element and is also the final member of the actinide series . Like all elements with atomic number over 100 , lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles . Eleven isotopes of lawrencium are currently known ; the most stable is 262Lr with a half @-@ life of 3 @.@ 6 hours , but the shorter @-@ lived 260Lr ( half @-@ life 2 @.@ 7 minutes ) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale . A new isotope , 266Lr , with a half @-@ life of 11 hours has been reported but not confirmed . 
 Chemistry experiments have confirmed that lawrencium indeed behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table , and is a trivalent element . It thus could also be classified as the first of the 7th @-@ period transition metals : however , its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the periodic table , having an s2p configuration instead of the <unk> configuration of its homolog lutetium . This means that lawrencium may be less volatile than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead . 
 In the 1950s , 1960s , and 1970s , many claims of the synthesis of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in the Soviet Union and the United States . The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists , and while the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) established lawrencium as the official name for the element and gave the American team credit for the discovery , this was reevaluated in 1997 , giving both teams shared credit for the discovery but not changing the element 's name . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1958 , scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory claimed the discovery of element 102 , now called nobelium . At the same time , they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding the same curium target used with nitrogen @-@ 14 ions . A follow @-@ up on this experiment was not performed , as the target was destroyed . Eighteen tracks were noted , with decay energy around ( 9 ± 1 ) MeV and half @-@ life around 1 ⁄ 4 s ; the Berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element 103 , other possibilities could not be ruled out . While the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for 257Lr ( alpha decay energy 8 @.@ 87 MeV , half @-@ life 0 @.@ 6 s ) , the evidence obtained in this experiment fell far short of the strength required to conclusively demonstrate the synthesis of element 103 . Later , in 1960 , the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory attempted to synthesize the element by bombarding 252Cf with 10B and 11B . The results of this experiment were not conclusive . 
 The first important work on element 103 was carried out at Berkeley by the nuclear @-@ physics team of Albert Ghiorso , Torbjørn <unk> , Almon Larsh , Robert M. Latimer , and their co @-@ workers on February 14 , 1961 . The first atoms of lawrencium were reportedly produced by bombarding a three @-@ milligram target consisting of three isotopes of the element californium with boron @-@ 10 and boron @-@ 11 nuclei from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator ( HILAC ) . The Berkeley team reported that the isotope 257103 was detected in this manner , and that it decayed by emitting an 8 @.@ 6 MeV alpha particle with a half @-@ life of ( 8 ± 2 ) s . This identification was later corrected to be 258103 , as later work proved that 257Lr did not have the properties detected , but 258Lr did . This was considered at the time to be convincing proof of the synthesis of element 103 : while the mass assignment was less certain and proved to be mistaken , it did not affect the arguments in favor of element 103 having been synthesized . Scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna ( then in the Soviet Union ) raised several criticisms : all but one were answered adequately . The exception was that 252Cf was the most common isotope in the target , and in the reactions with 10B , 258Lr could only have been produced by emitting four neutrons , and emitting three neutrons was expected to be much less likely than emitting four or five . This would lead to a narrow yield curve , not the broad one reported by the Berkeley team . A possible explanation was that there was a low number of events attributed to element 103 . This was an important intermediate step to the unquestioned discovery of element 103 , although the evidence was not completely convincing . The Berkeley team proposed the name " lawrencium " with symbol " Lw " , after Ernest Orlando Lawrence , inventor of the cyclotron . The IUPAC Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry accepted the name , but changed the symbol to " Lr " . This acceptance of the discovery was later characterized as being hasty by the Dubna team .

 The first work at Dubna on element 103 came in 1965 , when they reported to have created 256103 in 1965 by bombarding 243Am with 18O , identifying it indirectly from its granddaughter fermium @-@ 252 . The half @-@ life they reported was somewhat too high , possibly due to background events . Later 1967 work on the same reaction identified two decay energies in the ranges 8 @.@ 35 – 8 @.@ 50 MeV and 8 @.@ 50 – 8 @.@ 60 MeV : these were assigned to 256103 and 257103 . Despite repeated attempts , they were unable to confirm assignment of an alpha emitter with a half @-@ life of eight seconds to 257103 . The Russians proposed the name " rutherfordium " for the new element in 1967 : this name was later used for element 104 .

 Further experiments ( Dubna 1969 ; Berkeley 1970 ) demonstrated an actinide chemistry for the new element , so by 1970 it was known that lawrencium is the last actinide . In 1970 , the Dubna group reported the synthesis of <unk> with half @-@ life 20 s and alpha decay energy 8 @.@ 38 MeV . However , it was not until 1971 , when the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260 , that all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed , apart from the Berkeley 's group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of the probably correct 258103 . All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of X @-@ rays emitted from 258103 were measured . 
 In 1971 , the IUPAC granted the discovery of lawrencium to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory , even though they did not have ideal data for the element 's existence . However , in 1992 , the IUPAC Trans @-@ fermium Working Group ( TWG ) officially recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co @-@ discoverers of lawrencium , concluding that while the 1961 Berkeley experiments were an important step to lawrencium 's discovery , they were not yet completely convincing ; and while the 1965 , 1968 , and 1970 Dubna experiments came very close to the needed level of confidence taken together , only the 1971 Berkeley experiments , which clarified and confirmed previous observations , finally resulted in complete confidence in the discovery of element 103 . Because the name " lawrencium " had been in use for a long time by this point , it was retained by IUPAC , and in August 1997 , the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) ratified the name lawrencium and the symbol " Lr " during a meeting in Geneva .

 Lawrencium is the final member of the actinide series and is sometimes considered to be a group 3 element , along with scandium , yttrium , and lutetium , as its filled f @-@ shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th @-@ period transition metals . In the periodic table , it is located to the right of the actinide nobelium , to the left of the 6d transition metal rutherfordium , and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties . Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close @-@ packed crystal structure ( c / a = 1 @.@ 58 ) , similar to its lighter congener lutetium , though this is not yet known experimentally . The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352 kJ · mol − 1 , close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 7p1 / 2 ( or 6d ) electrons delocalized , a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization , bulk modulus , and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium . Specifically , lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent , silvery metal , easily oxidized by air , steam , and acids , and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171 pm . It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15 @.@ 6 to 16 @.@ 6 g · cm − 3 . It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900 K ( 1627 ° C ) , not far from the value for lutetium ( 1925 K ) .

 In 1949 , Glenn T. Seaborg , who devised the actinide concept that elements 89 to 103 formed an actinide series homologous to the lanthanide series from elements 57 to 71 , predicted that element 103 ( lawrencium ) should be its final member and that the Lr3 + ion should be about as stable as <unk> + in aqueous solution . It was not until decades later that element 103 was finally conclusively synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed . 
 1969 studies on the element showed that lawrencium reacted with chlorine to form a product that was most likely the trichloride <unk> . Its volatility was found to be similar to that of the chlorides of curium , fermium , and nobelium and much less than that of rutherfordium chloride . In 1970 , chemical studies were performed on 1500 atoms of the isotope 256Lr , comparing it with divalent ( No , Ba , Ra ) , trivalent ( Fm , Cf , Cm , Am , Ac ) , and tetravalent ( Th , Pu ) elements . It was found that lawrencium <unk> with the trivalent ions , but the short half @-@ life of the 256Lr isotope precluded a confirmation that it eluted ahead of Md3 + in the elution sequence . Lawrencium occurs as the trivalent Lr3 + ion in aqueous solution and hence its compounds should be similar to those of the other trivalent actinides : for example , lawrencium ( III ) fluoride ( <unk> ) and hydroxide ( Lr ( OH ) 3 ) should both be insoluble in water . Due to the actinide contraction , the ionic radius of Lr3 + should be smaller than that of Md3 + , and that it should elute ahead of Md3 + when ammonium α @-@ hydroxyisobutyrate ( ammonium α @-@ HIB ) is used as an eluant . Later 1987 experiments on the longer @-@ lived isotope 260Lr confirmed lawrencium 's <unk> and that it eluted in roughly the same place as erbium , and found that lawrencium 's ionic radius was ( 88 @.@ 6 ± 0 @.@ 3 ) pm , larger than would be expected from simple extrapolation from periodic trends . Later 1988 experiments with more lawrencium atoms refined this value to ( 88 @.@ 1 ± 0 @.@ 1 ) pm and calculated an enthalpy of hydration value of − ( <unk> ± 13 ) kJ · mol − 1 . It was also pointed out that the actinide contraction at the end of the actinide series was larger than the analogous lanthanide contraction , with the exception of the last actinide , lawrencium : the cause was speculated to be relativistic effects . 
 It has been speculated that the 7s electrons are relativistically stabilized , so that in reducing conditions , only the 7p1 / 2 or 6d electron would be ionized , leading to the monovalent Lr + ion . However , all experiments to reduce Lr3 + to <unk> + or Lr + in aqueous solution were unsuccessful . On the basis of this , the standard electrode potential of the E ° ( Lr3 + → <unk> + ) couple was calculated to be less than − 1 @.@ 56 V , indicating that the existence of Lr + ions in aqueous solution was unlikely . The upper limit for the E ° ( Lr3 + → <unk> + ) couple was predicted to be − 0 @.@ 44 V : the values for E ° ( Lr3 + → <unk> ) and E ° ( <unk> + → Lr3 + ) are predicted to be − 2 @.@ 06 V and + 7 @.@ 9 V. The stability of the group oxidation state in the 6d transition series is highest for lawrencium , and it decreases as Lr3 + > Rf4 + > <unk> + > <unk> + . 
 = = = Atomic = = = 
 A lawrencium atom has 103 electrons , of which three can act as valence electrons . In 1970 , it was predicted that the ground @-@ state electron configuration of lawrencium was [ Rn ] <unk> ( ground state term symbol <unk> / 2 ) , following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the [ Xe ] 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium 's lighter homolog lutetium . However , the next year , calculations were published that questioned this prediction , instead expecting an anomalous [ Rn ] <unk> configuration . Though early calculations gave conflicting results , more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion . 1974 relativistic calculations concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state . Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s2p configuration should be energetically favored , because the spherical s and p1 / 2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly . 
 In 1988 , a team of scientists led by Eichler calculated that lawrencium 's enthalpy of adsorption on metal sources would differ enough depending on its electron configuration that it would be feasible to carry out experiments to exploit this fact to measure lawrencium 's electron configuration . The s2p configuration was expected to be less volatile than the <unk> configuration , and be more similar to that of the p @-@ block element lead . The results were inconclusive : while no evidence for lawrencium being volatile was obtained , the lower limit for the enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on quartz or platinum was significantly higher than the estimated value for the s2p configuration , so that the electron configuration of lawrencium was still unknown as of 2006 . 
 In 2015 , the first ionization energy of lawrencium was measured , using the isotope 256Lr . The measured value , 4 @.@ 96 + 0 @.@ 08 
 − 0 @.@ 07 eV , agreed very well with the relativistic theoretical prediction of 4 @.@ 963 ( 15 ) eV , and also provided a first step into measuring the first ionization energies of the transactinides . This value is the lowest among all the lanthanides and actinides , and supports the s2p configuration as the 7p1 / 2 electron is expected to be only weakly bound . This suggests that lutetium and lawrencium behave similarly to the d @-@ block elements ( and hence being the true heavier congeners of scandium and yttrium , instead of lanthanum and actinium ) , and also that lawrencium may behave similarly to the alkali metals sodium and potassium in some ways . Given that the s2p configuration is correct , then lawrencium cannot be regarded as a transition metal under the IUPAC definition ( " An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub @-@ shell , or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub @-@ shell " ) , unlike its lighter homolog lutetium and the group 3 elements , with which lutetium and lawrencium are sometimes classified . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Twelve isotopes of lawrencium are known , with mass numbers 252 – 262 and 266 ; all are radioactive . Additionally , one nuclear isomer is known , with mass number 253 . The longest @-@ lived lawrencium isotope , 266Lr , has a half @-@ life of 11 hours and is one of the longest lived superheavy isotopes known to date , suggesting that it is perhaps on the shore of the island of stability of superheavy nuclei . However , shorter @-@ lived isotopes are usually used in chemical experiments because 266Lr currently can only be produced as a final decay product of even heavier and harder @-@ to @-@ synthesize elements : it was discovered in 2014 in the decay chain of ununseptium @-@ 294 . The isotope 256Lr ( half @-@ life 27 seconds ) was used in the first chemical studies on lawrencium : currently , the slightly longer lived isotope 260Lr ( half @-@ life 2 @.@ 7 minutes ) is usually used for this purpose . After 266Lr , the longest @-@ lived lawrencium isotopes are 262Lr ( 3 @.@ 6 h ) , <unk> ( 44 min ) , 260Lr ( 2 @.@ 7 min ) , 256Lr ( 27 s ) , and <unk> ( 22 s ) . All other known lawrencium isotopes have half @-@ lives under 20 seconds , and the shortest @-@ lived of them ( 252Lr ) has a half @-@ life of only 390 milliseconds . However , the undiscovered isotopes with mass numbers 263 to 265 are expected to have longer half @-@ lives ( <unk> , 5 h ; <unk> and <unk> , 10 h ) . The half @-@ lives of lawrencium isotopes mostly increase smoothly from 252Lr to 266Lr , with a dip from 257Lr to <unk> . 
 = = Preparation and purification = = 
 While the lightest ( 252Lr to <unk> ) and heaviest ( 266Lr ) lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of dubnium ( Z = 105 ) isotopes , the middle isotopes ( <unk> to 262Lr ) can all be produced by bombarding actinide ( americium to einsteinium ) targets with light ions ( from boron to neon ) . The two most important isotopes , 256Lr to 260Lr , are both in this range . 256Lr can be produced by bombarding californium @-@ 249 with 70 MeV boron @-@ 11 ions ( producing lawrencium @-@ 256 and four neutrons ) , while 260Lr can be produced by bombarding berkelium @-@ 249 with oxygen @-@ 18 ( producing lawrencium @-@ 260 , an alpha particle , and three neutrons ) . 
 Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half @-@ lives too short to allow a complete chemical purification process . Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction , with the chelating agent <unk> ( TTA ) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone ( <unk> ) as the organic phase , and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions . Ions of different charge ( + 2 , + 3 , or + 4 ) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges , but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8 @.@ 24 MeV alpha particles . More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α @-@ HIB to take place in enough time to separate out the longer @-@ lived isotope 260Lr , which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0 @.@ 05 M hydrochloric acid . 
 = Domnall mac Taidc = 
 Domnall mac Taidc Uí Briain ( died 1115 ) , also known as Domnall Ua Briain , Domhnall Ua Briain , and Domhnall mac <unk> , was the ruler of the Kingdom of the Isles , the Kingdom of Thomond , and perhaps the Kingdom of Dublin as well . His father was Tadc , son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain , King of Munster , which meant that Domnall was a member of the Meic Taidc , a branch of the Uí Briain . Domnall 's mother was Mór , daughter of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill , King of Dublin and the Isles , which may have given Domnall a stake to the kingship of the Isles . 
 In 1094 , Domnall 's uncle , Muirchertach Ua Briain , High King of Ireland , drove Gofraid Crobán , King of Dublin and the Isles from Dublin , and may have replaced him with Domnall himself . Certainly at some point following Gofraid 's death in 1095 , Muirchertach installed Domnall as King of the Isles . The latter 's reign was short @-@ lived however , and Domnall appears to have been forced from the Isles prior to its subsequent conquest by the King of Norway . 
 In 1111 , Domnall evidently seized the kingship of the Isles by force . It is uncertain whether he enjoyed Uí Briain support in this venture . Several years later , at a time when his aforesaid uncle was gravely ill , Domnall was again active in Ireland . Although he may have openly left the Isles to take advantage of his uncle 's demise , it is also possible he was forced out by the Islesmen . Domnall was slain in 1115 , apparently at the hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair , King of Connacht . It is possible that he was survived by two sons . 
 = = Familial origins = = 
 Domnall was a son of Tadc ( died 1086 ) , son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain , King of Munster ( died 1086 ) . Domnall was , therefore , a member of the Meic Taidc . According to <unk> , Domnall 's father married Mór , daughter of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill , King of Dublin and the Isles ( died 1064 / 1065 ) . This source specifies that the couple had three sons and a daughter : Amlaíb ( died 1096 ) , Bé Binn , Donnchad ( died 1113 ) , and Domnall himself .

 Toirdelbach Ua Briain died in 1086 , and the Kingdom of Munster was partitioned between his three surviving sons : Muirchertach ( died 1119 ) , Diarmait ( died 1118 ) , and Tadc .

Muirchertach then embarked upon extending his authority throughout Ireland . During this period , Muirchertach not only had to contend with the opposing forces of his surviving brother , but also those of the Meic Taidc , the sons of his deceased brother . In 1091 , however , the Meic Taidc appear to have come to terms with Muirchertach — at least temporarily — as the Annals of the Four Masters reports that a peace was agreed between him and the Meic Taidc , who are nonetheless said to have acted treacherously towards Muirchertach 's men . Although Muirchertach appears to have regained control of the Kingdom of Dublin by 1090 , he soon after lost it to Gofraid Crobán , King of the Isles ( died 1095 ) , until he forced the latter from the kingship of Dublin once and for all in 1094 . It may have been at this point that Muirchertach installed his son , Domnall Gerrlámhach ( died 1135 ) , to the kingship . Another possibility , however , is that Muirchertach instead appointed Domnall himself after Gofraid 's expulsion . 
 = = Meic Taidc interference in the Isles = = 
 Gofraid died in the Hebrides the year after his expulsion from Dublin . Whether this is evidence that he had been driven from Mann is uncertain . According to the Chronicle of Mann , Gofraid was succeeded in the Isles by his eldest son , Lagmann , who appears to have been forced to fend off factions supporting the claims of his younger brothers . At some point , the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach , and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lagmann 's younger brother , Amlaíb mac Gofraid ( died 1153 ) , was old enough to assume control . The chronicle 's account could be evidence that , by about 1096 , Lagmann faced a faction formed around his younger brother ; and that , when this faction was unable to topple Lagmann by itself , it approached Muirchertach for assistance in placing Amlaíb mac Gofraid upon the throne . Muirchertach was certainly a formidable potential ally , having recently imposed his dominance over the kingdoms of Connacht , Leinster , Mide , and Dublin . In consequence of this predominance , the clause as stated by the chronicle — that Muirchertach was to provide the Isles with a regent from his own kin — may well have been a condition on his intervention , rather than a request of the Islesmen themselves . Whatever the case , the chronicle reveals that Muirchertach then installed Domnall upon the throne . 
 Although Domnall had earlier opposed Muirchertach over the kingship of Munster , he possessed strong familial connections with the Isles through his maternal descent from Echmarcach . In fact , the Annals of Ulster reveals that at least two apparent members of Echmarcach 's family were killed less than a decade before in a repulsed invasion of Mann . As a result of their demise , Domnall may well have become the leading male representative of his mother 's family . In 1096 , the Annals of the Four Masters reveals that Domnall 's brother , Amlaíb , lost his life on Mann , apparently whilst supporting Domnall 's undertaking in the Isles . This source not only corroborates Uí Briain intervention in the Isles , but suggests that Domnall and the rest of the Meic Taidc faced significant opposition there , possibly in the form of Lagmann 's adherents . The chronicle credits Domnall with an oppressive three @-@ year reign that ended when the leading Islesmen revolted against him , and drove him from the kingdom back to Ireland . 
 = = Norwegian ascendancy in Dublin and the Isles = = 
 The extent of Domnall 's rule in the kingdom is unknown , and it is questionable whether he had any real authority in the northern Hebrides , furthest from Mann . In about 1097 , Magnús Óláfsson , King of Norway ( died 1105 ) sent a delegate named Ingimundr into the Isles to take possession of the kingdom . After installing himself on Lewis , Ingimundr was overthrown and killed whilst attempting to usurp the kingship . Ingimundr 's rationale for seating himself upon an island on the edge of the kingdom may have been due to the fact that he was unable to gain any authority on Mann itself . In fact , the chronicle reveals that civil war erupted there the following year , and the chronicler Orderic Vitalis ( died c . 1142 ) indicates that Mann was devastated to point of being a virtual desert by the time Magnús appeared on the scene . The warring itself may have been related to the aforesaid factional struggles between Gofraid 's sons , and the fact that the chronicle makes no mention of Domnall during this conflict may be evidence that he had lost control of Mann by then . 
 Within the year , Magnús himself arrived in the Isles , captured Lagmann , and conquered the kingdom . After overwintering in region , the Norwegian king left for Scandinavia in the summer , only to make his return nearly four years later , in 1102 or 1103 . Once re @-@ established on Mann , Magnús may well have seized control of Dublin before entering into an alliance with Muirchertach , formalised through the marriage between Magnús 's young son , Sigurðr ( died 1130 ) , and Muirchertach 's daughter , Bjaðmunjo ( fl . 1102 / 1103 ) . The arrangement itself reveals that Magnús intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently @-@ won territories , and suggests that Muirchertach intended to exert influence into the Isles through his new son @-@ in @-@ law . Unfortunately for Muirchertach , and his long @-@ term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles , Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103 , whereupon Sigurðr immediately repudiated his bride and returned to Norway . Although Muirchertach was able to regain control of Dublin , and still held considerable influence in the Isles , Magnús ' death appears to have left a power vacuum in the region that he was unable to fill . 
 = = Restoration in the Isles ; death in Ireland = = 
 In 1111 , according to the Annals of Inisfallen , Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the Isles by force . This annal @-@ entry is the only notice of Domnall 's lordship in the Isles preserved by Irish sources . This could indicate that the chronicle 's aforesaid account of the petitioning of Muirchertach is incorrectly dated , and actually refers to about 1111 . However , the fact that the chronicle places the petitioning during a period of new @-@ found Uí Briain dominance in the region , before Magnús ' arrival in the Isles , and at about the same time as Amlaíb 's death , suggests that the chronicle 's chronology concerning these events is sound , and that Domnall 's seizure of the kingship in 1111 was indeed a return to the Isles . 
 There is uncertainty as to whether Domnall was supported in his venture by the rest of the Uí Briain . Although it is possible that he had backing from Muirchertach himself , the fact that the Annals of the Four Masters states that Muirchertach had Domnall imprisoned three years before could be evidence that Domnall had made his move into the Isles without Muirchertach 's consent . The aforesaid annal @-@ entry concerning Domnall 's seizure of the Isles reveals that Domnall launched his campaign from northern Ireland , and a further entry in the same sources shows that Dublin was occupied by Muirchertach for about three months , the very year of Domnall 's campaign . These records appear to indicate that Domnall was aided in his undertaking in the Isles by Muirchertach 's northern opponents , and that Muirchertach occupied the town as means to directly counter Domnall 's campaign , and deny him any support from the Dubliners . In fact , Domnall may well have been supported in the Isles by Domnall Mac Lochlainn , King of Cenél nEógain ( died 1121 ) , not only Muirchertach 's principal rival , but the representative of a family with a long history of involvement in the region . 
 Not long after his intrusion into the Isles — perhaps in 1113 or 1114 — Domnall appears to have been either driven out by force , or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Muirchertach 's failing health . This would appear to have been about the point when Amlaíb mac Gofraid began his own forty @-@ year reign in the Isles . The latter , who apparently spent a considerable part of his childhood at the court of Henry I , King of England ( died 1135 ) , may well have enjoyed the English king 's assistance in assuming control of the Isles , and perhaps precipitated Domnall 's departure . Whatever the cause for Domnall 's return to Ireland , he certainly predeceased his rival uncle , and was killed by Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair , King of Connacht ( died 1156 ) , as the Annals of Inisfallen , the Annals of Loch Cé , the Annals of the Four Masters , and the Annals of Ulster , all report Domnall 's death at the hands of the Connachta in 1115 . In fact , Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair had invaded Thomond earlier that year , and the Annals of Tigernach elaborates that he had installed Domnall as King of Thomond at that point . This source further reveals that Domnall had afterwards turned against Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair , who in turn invaded Thomond and had Domnall eliminated . 
 Although two later members of the Uí Briain — Conchobar mac Domnaill Uí Briain , King of Ormond ( blinded 1128 ) , and Lughaid mac Domnaill Uí Briain ( died 1151 ) — appear to have been sons of Domnall 's aforesaid first cousin , Domnall Gerrlámhach , it is possible they were instead descendants of Domnall himself .

 White House Astronomy Night ( and alternatively Astronomy Night on the National Mall ) is an event first organized by the White House in conjunction with the Office of Science and Technology Policy to motivate interest in astronomy and science education . The original White House Astronomy Night was held in 2009 on the South Lawn . In 2010 the White House and the Office of Science and Technology Policy organized a similar event with help from Hofstra University , this time held on the National Mall . Between 2010 and 2014 annual events took place at the National Mall with coordination between Hofstra University and federal agencies including : the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum , NASA , and the National Science Foundation . In 2015 an event took place in June at the National Mall , and then back at the White House again on October 19 . 
 The 2012 book Rising Above the Gathering Storm by the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine noted the White House Astronomy Night indicated an emphasis by the Obama Administration towards support for education in the fields of Science , Technology , Engineering , and Mathematics ( STEM fields ) . The New Moon : Water , Exploration , and Future Habitation , written in 2014 by Arlin <unk> , observed this event and the inclusion of NASA 's Lunar Electric Rover in the First inauguration of Barack Obama reflected an emphasis on the importance of science education .

 The first White House Astronomy Night was held on the South Lawn on October 7 , 2009 . This first event coincided with the International Year of Astronomy . Science Advisor to the President John <unk> stood next to President Obama as the president made a speech wherein he emphasized the values of science education and how crucial it was to society to increase the interest of youth towards studying science . This was an attempt by the White House to increase motivation for children to enter Science , Technology , Engineering , and Mathematics ( STEM ) fields . Only optical telescopes were used to peer at the heavens during the events . Over twenty such telescopes were placed on the South Lawn of the White House in addition to displays of Moon rocks , meteorites , and presentations of the Solar System . 
 In addition the Obama family , in attendance at the event was NASA astronaut Sally Ride , the first female American to travel to space in 1983 . Ride wore her flight jacket and answered questions from children about the Solar System . 
 Amateur astronomers Caroline Moore and Lucas Bolyard attended the event . Both Moore and Bolyard had previously made noteworthy discoveries in astronomy . New York high school student Moore contributed to the discovery of Supernova 2008ha in 2008 , becoming the youngest individual to identify a supernova . 
 While a high school student in his second @-@ year at a school in West Virginia in 2009 , Bolyard found a rotating radio transient , a form of neutron star . Bolyard accomplished this through analysis of observations while a member of the Pulsar Search Collaboratory , an initiative aimed at allowing youth access to the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope through joint cooperation between West Virginia University and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory .

 On August 21 , 2015 the White House announced that the Astronomy Night that year would take place on the South Lawn of the White House on October 19 . Students , teachers , and professionals from the fields of astronomy and the private sector of space exploration were invited to attend . One notable participant was Ahmed Mohamed , a Texas high school student who assembled a makeshift clock at home , brought it to school , and was detained and questioned by police after a teacher thought it resembled a bomb . In the wake of subsequent publicity , President Obama tweeted an invitation to Mohamed to visit the White House with his " cool clock " . Obama Administration staff urged him to attend Astronomy Night , with Press Secretary Josh Earnest calling the incident a " teachable moment " and Science Advisor John <unk> extending a formal invitation . 
 That night , the President gave a speech to the Astronomy Night audience , saying : " We have to watch for and cultivate and encourage those glimmers of curiosity and possibility , not suppress them , not squelch them . " Afterwards , the President talked with Mohamed briefly and hugged him . Obama looked through a telescope and participated in a call with the crew of the International Space Station . Children who attended the event inspected meteorites , specimens from Mars and moon rocks . It was mentioned that the <unk> Exoplanet Survey Satellite was supported by the President along with the James Webb Space Telescope , in a White House Fact Sheet about the 2015 White House Astronomy night . 
 <unk> Alvarez @-@ <unk> , a high school student from Brooklyn , New York , assisted the President in gazing at the moon through a telescope . She explained to the President that craters on the moon were caused by impacts from space materials . The Russellville , Alabama @-@ based group Russellville City Schools Engineering Rocket Team attended the event and were personally recognized by President Obama . Team members Chelsea <unk> , Katie Burns , Niles Butts , Andrew Heath , Cristian Ruiz , Cady Studdard and Evan Swinney were requested by the President to stand at the event and speak to the crowd about the rocketry accomplishments , which included achieving victory among contestants at the 2015 International Rocketry Challenge at the Paris Air Show . The students were able to meet celebrities who attended the event , including : Bill Nye , and MythBusters co @-@ hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage . 
 Indian @-@ American student <unk> Sivakumar was praised by the President in his speech at the event . President Obama recounted how Sivakumar was first intrigued by scientists at six @-@ years @-@ old , after reading about famous researchers in an encyclopedia . His parents cultivated his quest for knowledge by bringing him to lectures on astrophysics ; he went on to become a two @-@ time finalist at the Google Science Fair . Obama cited Sivakumar as an example of the outstanding students that attended the stargazing event at the White House . 
 Florida student Kiera Wilmot attended the event ; she gained notice in the press two years prior , after being arrested and charged with a felony when her science project made a loud popping noise . At the time an honors high school student participating in a science project in Polk County , Florida at Bartow High School , Wilmot combined aluminum foil and toilet @-@ bowl cleaner inside of a bottle . After the bottle made a loud popping noise , Wilmot was removed from the class , placed in handcuffs , sent to a juvenile detention facility and faced charges of obtaining and utilizing a destructive device . Administration officials at her school explained their reactions to her science project by stating they had a zero tolerance practice in place against undesirable behaviors or possession of items ; charges against her were dropped and she went back to the high school . At the time of her attendance at the White House Astronomy Night , Wilmot was a student at Florida Polytechnic University with a focus in mechanical engineering .

 = <unk> butterfly ray = 
 The longtail butterfly ray ( Gymnura poecilura ) is a species of butterfly ray , family <unk> , native to the Indo @-@ Pacific from the Red Sea to southern Japan and western Indonesia . Growing up to 92 cm ( 36 in ) across , this ray has a lozenge @-@ shaped pectoral fin disc about twice as wide as long , colored brown to gray above with many small , light spots . The spiracles behind its eyes have smooth rims . This species can be identified by its tail , which is about as long as the snout @-@ to @-@ vent distance , lacks fins , and bears nine to twelve each of alternating black and white bands . 
 Bottom @-@ dwelling in nature , the longtail butterfly ray frequents sandy or muddy habitats in coastal waters shallower than 30 m ( 98 ft ) . Its diet consists of bony fishes , molluscs , and crustaceans . This species gives birth to live young ; the developing embryos are nourished first by yolk and later by histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) supplied by its mother . There is no defined breeding season , and females bear litters of up to seven pups . Used for its meat , the longtail butterfly ray is often caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed this species as Near Threatened , citing the high levels of fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The longtail butterfly ray was originally described as Raja poecilura by English zoologist George Shaw , in his 1804 General Zoology or Systematic Natural History . He did not designate a type specimen as his account was based on an illustration by Scottish naturalist Patrick Russell , published a year earlier in Descriptions and Figures of Two Hundred Fishes Collected at Vizagapatam on the Coast of Coromandel . The specific epithet poecilura is derived from the Greek <unk> ( " of many colors " ) and oura ( " tail " ) . Later authors moved this species to the genus Gymnura . 
 Further research is needed to determine whether the isolated longtail butterfly rays in French Polynesia are in fact the same species as those from the rest of its range . Phylogenetic studies based on morphology and mitochondrial DNA indicate that the longtail butterfly ray is closely related to the <unk> butterfly ray ( G. <unk> ) , which shares much of its range in the Indo @-@ Pacific . Another name for the longtail butterfly ray is variegated butterfly ray . 
 = = Description = = 
 The pectoral fin disc of the longtail butterfly ray has the lozenge shape characteristic of its family , measuring around twice as wide as long . The leading margin of the disc is gently sinuous , the trailing margin is convex , and the outer corners are mildly angular . The snout is short and broad , with a tiny protruding tip . The medium @-@ sized eyes have larger , smooth @-@ rimmed spiracles behind . The nostrils are positioned close to the mouth ; between them is a short and broad curtain of skin with a smooth margin . The large mouth forms a transverse curve and contains over 50 tooth rows in each jaw , increasing in number with age ; the teeth are small , narrow , and pointed . There are five pairs of short gill slits on the underside of the disc . The pelvic fins are small and rounded . 
 The thread @-@ like tail lacks dorsal or caudal fins , though there are low ridges along its length above and below . Its length is about equal to the distance between the snout tip and the vent , distinguishing this species from other butterfly rays that have shorter tails . Sometimes there is a small stinging spine ( very rarely two ) on the upper surface of the tail near the base . The skin is devoid of dermal denticles . This species is brown to greenish brown to gray above , with many small pale spots and sometimes also a smattering of dark dots . The tail has nine to twelve black bands alternating with white bands , which often have a small , dorsally positioned dark spot within . The underside is white , darkening at the edges of the fins . The longtail butterfly ray attains a maximum width of 92 cm ( 36 in ) .
