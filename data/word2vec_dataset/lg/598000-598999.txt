 Shortly after the events of Saints Row : The Third , The Boss , Shaundi and Pierce Washington are called upon to assist MI @-@ 6 agent Asha <unk> and her contact , reformed former Deckers leader Matt Miller , in infiltrating a Middle Eastern compound to assassinate former STAG leader Cyrus Temple and prevent a nuclear missile strike against Washington D.C. The Boss kills Cyrus , but is unable to stop him from launching the missile . Climbing aboard it , the Boss disarms the nuke before it reaches Washington , earning the adoration of America . 
 Five years later , The Boss has been elected President of the United States , with the other members of the Saints , Keith David and former Vice Kings leader Benjamin King acting as cabinet . While preparing for a press conference , the Boss is told that Asha and Matt have arrived at the White House to warn them of what they suspect is an impending alien invasion . Just as the Boss is informed , the invasion begins , spearheaded by the alien warlord Zinyak , who captures the Boss and all of the cabinet members . 
 The Boss wakes up in a 1950s sitcom set in the city of Steelport , devoid of violence and foul language . The Saints ' computer hacking specialist , Kinzie Kensington , contacts the Boss and informs them that they are trapped inside a simulation , with each of the Zin 's prisoners trapped inside personal simulations of their own fears in order to break their will . With Kinzie 's help , the Boss breaks free of the simulation and joins Kinzie and Keith in a stolen Zin ship . 
 While the trio attempt to contact reinforcements from Earth , Zinyak <unk> the planet , killing everyone not already captured by the Zin . Determined to get revenge for Earth , the Boss returns to the Steelport simulation to find their friends and reach Zinyak . After rescuing another prisoner of Zinyak , an artificial intelligence later named CID , and providing him with a physical body , the Boss , with his help , goes into the other Saint 's simulations and rescues them from their nightmares . 
 As the simulation begins to weaken under the Saints ' influence , Zinyak floods virtual Steelport with copies of gang members the Boss has faced in the past . Kinzie determines that the copies are being made from someone 's memory , leading the Boss to conclude Johnny Gat is still alive and trapped within the simulation . Despite protests from Kinzie and Matt that rescuing Johnny will reveal their location to Zinyak , the Boss rescues Johnny from his nightmare of Aisha 's death and gets him back to the ship . Johnny explains that during the fight in which he was presumed killed , he was actually abducted by Zinyak years in advance of their invasion , as Zinyak had concluded that Johnny could have single @-@ handedly stopped him if left on Earth . 
 The Saints rally inside the simulation in order to confront Zinyak , but are ambushed by an enormous Zin force . They escape , but Kinzie is captured by Zinyak and the Boss emerges from the simulation to find that Keith betrayed the Saints and fled . Returning to Steelport , the Boss finds Keith has been declared president of the simulation . When confronted , Keith claims that Zinyak has the means to restore Earth , and has agreed to do so in exchange for the Boss ' life . However , Keith is ultimately unable to bring himself to kill the Boss , and rejoins the Saints . The Boss , determined to find Kinzie , pursues Keith into his nightmare , and with help from Roddy Piper , beats Keith up until he barely manages to tell them where Kinzie has been taken to . 
 After the Boss rescues Kinzie from her nightmare , she devises a plan to crash the simulation , which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running , thus weakening the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter . Working together , the remaining Saints manage to overload the simulation , shutting it down just as the Boss escapes . Assaulting Zinyak 's ship , the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers they had in the simulation , and confronts Zinyak in his throne room . While the entire Zin Empire watches , Zinyak and the Boss battle each other . With help from the Saints , the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious . Impressed , the Zin forces surrender to the Boss , who becomes the new head of the Zin Empire . 
 The Boss asks <unk> , Zinyak 's main servant , for technology to bring Earth back . <unk> says they cannot restore Earth , but can use time @-@ travel technology to return to Earth , explaining that Zinyak had used this technology to collect his favorite historical figures , keeping them in suspended animation . The Boss looks at the Saints and says , " Let 's go on a field trip . " In a post @-@ credits scene , the nineteenth century writer Jane Austen , whom the Boss is a fan of , is woken out of her stasis , revealing that she had been the narrator throughout the game . 
 If all of the loyalty missions have not been completed , an alternate ending out plays out , which sees the Saints make plans to take over more planets , unaware of their ability to use the technology .

 A number of characters from earlier games in the franchise - both members of the Third Street Saints and former adversaries - make a return in Saints Row IV , many of whom take up the protagonist 's Presidential administration . Kinzie Kensington , the socially awkward FBI hacker from Saints Row : The Third becomes the White House 's press secretary , often tasked with clearing up the mess left behind by the President 's verbal missteps . Benjamin King , former leader of the Vice Kings gang from the original Saints Row , becomes the President 's Chief of Staff , while Pierce Washington has been appointed the Communications Director and Shaundi as the Director of the Secret Service . 
 Matt Miller , having abandoned the Deckers and , according to news broadcasts in Saints Row : The Third , announced an abstinence from the use of technology , presumably returned to the United Kingdom and became employed by MI @-@ 6 alongside new character Asha <unk> . Johnny Gat also returns after being thought dead in Saints Row : The Third . Stilwater , the location of the first two games , makes an appearance for one mission with most of the street gangs from the first three games making appearances as well . 
 = = Development = = 
 Saints Row : The Third Enter the Dominatrix was first announced as a 2012 April Fool 's joke , but went into development . The expansion pack 's basic concept included a superpowered player @-@ character trapped by alien commander Zinyak in a simulation of Steelport . THQ president Jason Rubin encouraged company subsidiary and Saints Row series developer Volition to grow elements from the expansion into a full game . The company announced this change in direction in June 2012 , and postponed Enter the Dominatrix into downloadable content for the full sequel , Saints Row IV . The company 's strategy was partly to avoid sales issues by releasing the game in August 2013 , prior to the circulation of rumors about next generation video game consoles . Volition was sold to Koch Media in early 2013 when its parent company , THQ , filed for bankruptcy . It became Koch 's first internal video game studio . The studio officially announced Saints Row IV two months later , which was published by Koch Media brand Deep Silver . Acquired without rights to their Red Faction series , Volition 's new goals were to make connected , open world games where " the player is an agent of mayhem " . The entire company worked on the one game . 
 Each of the Saints Row series games had a core intent , and while the first three games built on the first 's " outlandishness and irreverence " , the fourth focused on " the supernatural and superpowers " . Senior producer Jim Boone recalled reviewers that asked whether the company could be " more over @-@ the @-@ top " than Saints Row : The Third , which they took as a challenge . The team focused more on making the game " fun " than " for the sake of being over the top " , and felt that superpowers helped the game 's basic navigation and combat . They also chose to remove the previous game 's in @-@ game mobile phone @-@ based navigation , which hindered its narration , and replaced it with a " quest log structure " . The team chose not to devote as much time improving the game 's graphics , considering the impending release of next generation platforms . The game spent less time in development than prior series games . 
 In August 2014 , Volition announced that they would be releasing a development kit for the Windows version of the game , which lets players modify game assets and create new weapons . 
 The in @-@ game radio has seven pre @-@ programmed radio stations and 109 licensed tracks . The game 's original soundtrack is composed by Malcolm Kirby Jr . , who also composed the previous game 's soundtrack . 
 = = = Release and downloadable content = = = 
 Saints Row IV was released for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 in North America on August 20 , 2013 , and worldwide on three days later . Preorders included a patriot @-@ themed downloadable content pack that included flamethrower , dubstep , and rocket launcher weapons , a bald eagle jet , and an Uncle Sam outfit . A limited edition release of the game included a replica of the game 's dubstep gun , a doomsday button , and Johnny Gat statuette . Another limited edition release , the Game of the Generation Edition , included the previous items as well as a display case for the game . The game was originally refused ratings classification and effectively banned in Australia , but was later accepted when modified to remove an optional mission that involved an anal probe weapon and incentivized drug use . The country 's PlayStation 4 release was later recalled due to a classification error . 
 The game received multiple downloadable content packs . A Season Pass , which features two new mission packs and the aforementioned anal probe weapon , was announced prior to the game 's release . The first mission pack , Enter the Dominatrix , was released October 22 , 2013 . The pack was originally intended as a mission pack for Saints Row : The Third but evolved into the full sequel , Saints Row IV . The leftover content became the sequel 's first mission pack . It tells an alternative story about the Zin invasion wherein the Steelport simulation is hijacked by a rogue artificial intelligence called the Dominatrix . The pack 's storytelling frequently breaks the fourth wall and self @-@ referentially acknowledges its own plot holes and incongruence with the larger Saints Row story . Some scenes end in concept art or videos of Volition employees acting out the drama so as to give the game an unfinished feel . The pack also casts characters from Saints Row : The Third who did not return in the sequel . There are five missions in total , new weapons , vehicles , and computer @-@ controlled support characters ( " homies " ) . The second and final mission pack , How the Saints Save Christmas , features new weapons and vehicles and a plot to save Santa Claus from the Steelport simulation . It was released in December 2013 . Non @-@ mission downloadable content packs include new costumes , vehicles , and weapons , e.g. , face masks of United States Presidents George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , George W. Bush , and Barack Obama . 
 Saints Row IV was released in several summative editions . The Game of the Century edition included 20 downloadable content sets and was released May 9 , 2014 . The National Treasure Edition included 29 downloadable content sets and was released on July 8 , 2014 . High Voltage Software ported the game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with all of its downloadable content as Saints Row IV : Re @-@ Elected . It was announced in late August 2014 alongside Saints Row : Gat Out of Hell , a standalone Saints Row IV expansion developed by Volition in conjunction with High Voltage . Both were released in North America on January 20 , 2015 , and worldwide three days later , both separately and bundled together . The release included new features such as voice commands . A Linux port was presented in December 2015 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The game received " generally positive " reviews , according to video game review aggregator Metacritic . Reviewers praised its over @-@ the @-@ top humor and character customization options , and criticized its lack of challenge . Several also commented on its " even @-@ handed treatment " of gender , particularly female characters , and spotlighted hacker and former FBI agent Kinzie Kensington 's character performance . Saints Row IV sold over one million copies in its first week , and as of 2013 , Volition has not released total sales figures . 
 Polygon 's Danielle Riendeau described Saints Row IV as " big , goofy , and self @-@ referential fun " and thought that the game accomplished what it set out to be : " an outrageous exercise in player power fantasy " . She also praised the game 's degree of freedom around character identity , its " dumb and lovable " narrative , and its transitions between varied sequences . Riendeau wrote that Volition " trimmed the fat " from previous games , and that their addition of superpowers " blew the constraints off a genre already known for player freedom " . She considered the story funny and " as obvious as can be " , but found its characters " well @-@ realized " . Riendeau particularly praised the game 's " treatment of gender " — bold female characters who could pursue same @-@ sex relationships or even switch their gender mid @-@ game , and were not treated differently for being female — but found the game 's continued association between women and sex workers " problematic " and a " vestige from the series ' roots as a juvenile crime drama " . 
 Reflecting on the series ' progression , Eurogamer 's Chris Schilling said that Saints Row IV successfully reinvented the series yet again , with superpowers replacing the usefulness of in @-@ game vehicles . He compared the game 's exploration mechanics to that of Crackdown , and its superpowers to the Infamous and Prototype series , and added that the game 's silliness fulfilled a specific niche in gaming . Schilling wrote that the need to restock at ammo shops was a " jarring holdover " from the previous games , but appreciated the recurrence of elements such as the GPS navigation system , side mission gameplay , and city district liberation . He regarded the game overall as artful but " gloriously dumb " , like " the Sistine Chapel ceiling of stupidity " . Schilling also commented on how he felt an urge to simply forgo the story to search for collectibles , though despite these options , the game became " wearying " over long play sessions . 
 Similarly , Dan Stapleton of IGN became bored when his superhero protagonist had little " to overcome " , and ultimately likened the game to " enabling god @-@ like cheat codes " in its predecessor . He wrote that it was very difficult to die , given the large amount of power @-@ ups dropped by enemies , and that the otherwise praiseworthy features from Saints Row : The Third felt " vestigial " when outmoded by superpowers . Stapleton said the player received the powers too early , which let the player play without caring about the city , and thus removed the " sense of place and character it had in the previous game " . He considered the game 's large number of collectibles an acknowledgement of this hole , which while originally rewarding , quickly becomes a " chore " . Stapleton praised the Red Faction @-@ style <unk> and <unk> guns , though considered the dubstep gun an " ineffective disappointment " . As a symbol , though , Polygon described the dubstep gun as " iconic " of Saints Row IV . 
 = Italian ironclad Palestro = 
 Palestro was an ironclad warship , the second and final member of the Principe Amedeo class , built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in the 1860s and 1870s . She was armed with a battery of six 10 in ( 254 mm ) guns and one 11 in ( 279 mm ) gun . The last sail @-@ rigged ironclad of the Italian fleet , she had a single steam engine that was capable of propelling the ship at a speed of slightly over 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . 
 Obsolescent before she entered service , Palestro had an uneventful career . She served primarily in Italy 's colonial empire and did not see action . In 1880 , she took part in an international naval demonstration off Ragusa to enforce the Treaty of Berlin . Palestro was employed in the defense of La Maddalena from 1889 to 1894 , and thereafter as a training ship . She was stricken from the naval register in 1900 and broken up for scrap in 1902 – 1904 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Palestro was 78 @.@ 82 meters ( 258 @.@ 6 ft ) long between perpendiculars ; she had a beam of 17 @.@ 3 m ( 57 ft ) and an average draft of 8 m ( 26 ft ) . She displaced 5 @,@ 761 metric tons ( 5 @,@ 670 long tons ; 6 @,@ 350 short tons ) normally and up to 6 @,@ 318 t ( 6 @,@ 218 long tons ; 6 @,@ 964 short tons ) at full load . Her propulsion system consisted of one single @-@ expansion steam engine that drove a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by six coal @-@ fired , cylindrical fire @-@ tube boilers . Her engine produced a top speed of 12 @.@ 85 knots ( 23 @.@ 80 km / h ; 14 @.@ 79 mph ) at 6 @,@ 117 indicated horsepower ( 4 @,@ 561 kW ) . She could steam for 1 @,@ 780 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 300 km ; 2 @,@ 050 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ship was barque @-@ rigged to supplement the steam engine ; Palestro and her sister were the last rigged ironclads to be built by Italy . She had a crew of 548 officers and men . 
 Palestro was armed with a main battery of six 10 in ( 254 mm ) guns , mounted in three armored casemates . The first was located forward , toward the bow , the second and third were placed close to the stern on each side of the ship . A 11 in ( 279 mm ) gun was mounted forward as a bow chaser . Palestro was protected by iron belt armor that was 8 @.@ 7 in ( 221 mm ) thick and extended for the entire length of the hull . The casemates were protected with 5 @.@ 5 in ( 140 mm ) of iron plating , and the small conning tower had 2 @.@ 4 in ( 61 mm ) thick iron plates . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The keel for Palestro was laid down at the Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia shipyard in August 1865 . The ship was named for the gunboat Palestro , which had been sunk at the Battle of Lissa in 1866 . The date of her launch is unknown , though surviving records indicate either 30 September or 2 October 1871 . The ship was completed on 11 July 1875 , after almost a decade of work . Obsolescent by the time she was completed , Palestro primarily served in the Italian colonial empire , which Italy had begun acquiring in the 1880s . She occasionally took part in training maneuvers with the main Italian fleet throughout her career . 
 In November 1880 , Palestro and the ironclad Roma took part in a naval demonstration off Ragusa in an attempt to force the Ottoman Empire to comply with the terms of the Treaty of Berlin and turn over the town of Ulcinj to Montenegro . Palestro was used as a headquarters ship for the ships defending La Maddalena from 1889 to 1894 . She was then used as a training ship for coxswains . The ship was stricken from the naval register on 14 April 1900 and broken up for scrap between 1902 and 1904 .

 SR 605 runs through the northeastern corner of Franklin County and the southeastern portion of Delaware County . 5 @,@ 470 vehicles travel the road on average daily near the southern terminus , and 3 @,@ 840 near the northern terminus . It starts at a signalized intersection with US 62 in downtown New Albany . The route quickly leaves downtown New Albany and heads northward . SR 605 soon crosses over SR 161 using a bridge , and intersects Walton Parkway . Here , houses slowly transition to farmland . The road then intersects <unk> Road and crosses into Delaware County , in the middle of large fields . A few miles into Delaware County , SR 605 crosses Center Village Road in the unincorporated village of Center Village . Soon after , SR 605 ends at the signalized intersection of SR 37 and continues as County Road 605 .

 A road from New Albany to north of Center Village first appeared on maps in 1924 . In 1929 , the road was extended to connect to Condit . SR 605 was designated in 1937 , following the alignment from US 62 , to a junction with the US 36 / SR 3 concurrency in Condit . By 1994 , jurisdiction of the portion of SR 605 between SR 37 and the US 36 / SR 3 concurrency was transferred from the Ohio Department of Transportation ( ODOT ) to Delaware County , who renamed the road to County Road 605 . As a result of this move , SR 605 took on the routing that it does today .

 = Beatty , Nevada = 
 Beatty ( pronounced BAY @-@ dee ) is an unincorporated community and a census @-@ designated place ( CDP ) along the Amargosa River in Nye County in the U.S. state of Nevada . U.S. Route 95 runs through the CDP , which lies between Tonopah , about 90 miles ( 140 km ) to the north , and Las Vegas , about 120 miles ( 190 km ) to the southeast . State Route 374 connects Beatty to Death Valley National Park , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) to the west . 
 Before the arrival of non @-@ indigenous people in the 19th century , the region was home to groups of Western Shoshone . Established in 1905 , the community was named after Montillus ( Montillion ) Murray " Old Man " Beatty , who settled on a ranch in the Oasis Valley in 1896 and became Beatty 's first postmaster . With the arrival of the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad in 1905 , the CDP became a railway center for the Bullfrog Mining District , including mining towns such as nearby Rhyolite . Starting in the 1940s , Nellis Air Force Base and other federal installations contributed to the town 's economy as did tourism related to Death Valley National Park and the rise of Las Vegas as an entertainment center . 
 Beatty is home to the Beatty Museum and Historical Society and to businesses catering to tourist travel . The ghost town of Rhyolite and the Goldwell Open Air Museum ( a sculpture park ) , are both about 4 miles ( 6 km ) to the west , and Yucca Mountain and the Nevada Test Site are about 18 miles ( 29 km ) to the east . 
 = = History = = 
 Before the arrival of non @-@ indigenous explorers , prospectors , and settlers , Western Shoshone in the Beatty area hunted game and gathered wild plants in the region . It is estimated that the 19th @-@ century population density of the Indians near Beatty was one person per 44 square miles ( 110 km2 ) . By the middle of the century , European diseases had greatly reduced the Indian population , and incursions by newcomers had disrupted the native traditions . In about 1875 , the Shoshone had six camps , with a total population of 29 , along the Amargosa River near Beatty . Some of the survivors and their descendants continued to live in or near Beatty , while others moved to reservations at Walker Lake , Reese River , <unk> , or elsewhere . 
 Beatty is named after " Old Man " Montillus ( Montillion ) Murray Beatty , a Civil War veteran and miner who bought a ranch along the Amargosa River just north of the future community and became its first postmaster in 1905 . The community was laid out in 1904 or 1905 after Ernest Alexander " Bob " Montgomery , owner of the Montgomery Shoshone Mine near Rhyolite , decided to build the Montgomery Hotel in Beatty . Montgomery was drawn to the area , known as the Bullfrog Mining District , because of a gold rush that began in 1904 in the Bullfrog Hills west of Beatty . 
 During Beatty 's first year , wagons pulled by teams of horses or mules hauled freight between the Bullfrog district ( that included the towns of Rhyolite , Bullfrog , Gold Center , Transvaal , and Springdale ) and the nearest railroad , in Las Vegas , and by the middle of 1905 , about 1 @,@ 500 horses were engaged in this business . In October 1906 , the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad ( LV & T ) began regular service to Beatty ; in April 1907 , the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad ( BG ) reached the community , and the Tonopah and Tidewater ( T & T ) line added a third railroad in October 1907 . The LV & T ceased operations in 1918 , the BG in 1928 , and the T & T in 1940 . Until the railroads abandoned their lines , Beatty served as the railhead for many mines in the area , including a fluorspar mine on Bare Mountain , to the east . 
 Beatty 's first newspaper was the Beatty Bullfrog Miner , which began publishing in 1905 and went out of business in 1909 . The Rhyolite Herald was the region 's most important paper , starting in 1905 and reaching a circulation of 10 @,@ 000 by 1909 . It ceased publication in 1912 , and the Beatty area had no newspaper from then until 1947 . The Beatty Bulletin , a supplement to the Goldfield News , was published from then through 1956 . 
 Beatty 's population grew slowly in the first half of the 20th century , rising from 169 in 1929 to 485 in 1950 . The first reliable electric company in the community , Amargosa Power Company , began supplying electricity in about 1940 . Phone service arrived during World War II , and the CDP installed a community @-@ wide sewer system in the 1970s . When a new mine opened west of Beatty in 1988 , the population briefly surged from about 1 @,@ 000 to between 1 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 000 by the end of 1990 . Since the mine 's closing in 1998 , the population has fallen again to near its former level .

 Early businesses in Beatty included the Montgomery Hotel , built by a mine owner in 1905 , and freight businesses first centered on horse @-@ drawn wagons and later on railroads serving the mining towns in the Bullfrog district . Beatty became the economic center for a large sparsely populated region . Aside from mining , other activities sustaining the community during the 1920s and 1930s included retail sales , gas and oil distribution , construction of Scotty 's Castle , and the production and sale of illegal alcohol during Prohibition . 
 Nevada 's legalization of gambling in 1931 , the establishment of Death Valley National Monument in 1933 , and the rise of Las Vegas as an entertainment center , brought visitors to Beatty , which became increasingly tourist @-@ oriented . 
 As underground mining declined in the region , federal defense spending , starting with the Nellis Air Force Range in 1940 and the Nevada Test Site in 1950 , also contributed to the local economy . However , in 1988 , an open @-@ pit mine and mill began operations about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) west of Beatty along State Route 374 . Barrick Gold acquired the mine in 1994 and continued to extract and process ore at what became known as the Barrick Bullfrog Mine . At its peak , the mine employed 540 workers , many of whom lived in Beatty . The mine closed in 1998 . 
 In 2004 , the federal Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) named the closed Barrick Bullfrog mine site as one of six slated for pilot reclamation projects under the national <unk> Mine @-@ Scarred Land Initiative . A local group , the Beatty Economic Development Corporation ( <unk> ) , in discussions with the EPA , suggested solar @-@ power generation as a potential use for the site . Barrick Gold later transferred 81 acres ( 33 ha ) of its land to Beatty . In February 2009 , the New York Times published a <unk> article suggesting that part of the economic stimulus money from the $ 787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act might finance the Beatty project . " Studies show that the Beatty area has some of the best solar energy potential in the United States , as well as a high potential for wind @-@ power generation , " the <unk> story said . 
 The Beatty Chamber of Commerce web site describes the community as the Gateway to Death Valley , a small rural locality that has " everything the desert visitor needs " including motels and recreational vehicle ( RV ) sites . Aside from tourism , businesses contributing to the local economy include mining , retail trade , public administration and gambling .

 From 1961 until 1972 the local Lions Club held annual burro races that were quite successful . Competitors came from all over the United States , Canada , and as far away as Iran . National attention was brought to the race when Reg Potterton wrote a feature article about the 1971 race for Playboy magazine . The story appeared in the May 1972 issue , and featured stories about the town , the contestants , and the tourists who attended . Eventually the races were discontinued after organizers decided that the visitors they attracted were not good for Beatty 's image .

 The community is home to the Beatty Museum and Historical Society . The ghost town of Rhyolite and the Goldwell Open Air Museum , a sculpture park , are about 4 miles ( 6 km ) to the west .

In addition to highways , Beatty has a general aviation airfield , Beatty Airport , about 3 miles ( 5 km ) south of downtown . Beatty Medical Center , which opened in 1977 , provides family medicine and other services . The Beatty Library , a member of the Cooperative Libraries Automated Network , has a searchable online catalog . Beatty 's combined elementary and middle schools , serving kindergarten through eighth grade , and Beatty High School , grades 9 – 12 , are part of the Nye County School District .

 " You 're Not Sorry " is a country rock song with a length lasting four minutes and 21 seconds . Todd Martens of The Los Angeles Times felt the track was an old @-@ fashioned power ballad , rather than country . Jordan Levin of The Miami Herald agreed and described its genre as a " rebellious rock tune . " The song is set in common time and has a slow tempo of 67 @.@ 5 beats per minute . It is written in the key of E ♭ minor and Swift 's vocals span two octaves , from G ♭ 3 to C ♭ 4 . The musical arrangement contains a prominent hook during its chorus , according to Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine . " You 're Not Sorry " commences with piano and , mid @-@ song , progresses toward backing electric guitars , which eventually reach a solo . Martens believed Swift 's vocals were not the strongest because the existence of the electric guitar solo was meant to prevent too many high notes . It follows the chord progression E ♭ m – C ♭ – G ♭ – D ♭ . Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine noted the lyrics to " You 're Not Sorry " had many " tingling pheromones " .

Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter said " You 're Not Sorry " was ostentatious in regards to Swift 's crossover potential . Nick Catucci of New York magazine read an article posted in The New York Times , which stated Swift " quickly established herself as the most remarkable country music breakthrough artist of the decade " , and opted his own opinion , based on the song . Catucci said , " And indeed , we think we got a little fairy dust in our eyes listening to ' You 're Not Sorry ' [ ...

Midway through " You 're Not Sorry " , Swift ceases playing the piano and commences to sing a cover version of Justin Timberlake 's " What Goes Around ... / ...

Throughout the remainder of the performance , she intermingled between the two songs as smoke swirled and lightning was projected on the stage . Jon Pareles of The New York Times referred to the performance as one of the night 's highlights at the August 27 , 2009 , concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City .

" Alice Fisher of the United Kingdom magazine The Observer believed the performance at the May 7 , 2009 , concert at Shepherd 's Bush Empire in London , England " was undermined by the way Swift writhed on her stool and awkwardly thumped the piano lid in one of the most unconvincing displays of passion I 've seen since Footballers ' Wives finished .

I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is , in a really interesting way , and we pulled it off , I think . " The video was filmed in Los Angeles , California in late @-@ April 2011 , just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour . Dev took more control over the " In the Dark " video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director " take a little bit of control " when she was inexperienced in the process .

 = Arizona State Route 97 = 
 State Route 97 ( SR 97 ) is a 10 @.@ 91 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 17 @.@ 56 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Arizona . It runs from U.S. Route 93 ( US 93 ) northwest of Congress northeast to SR 96 southeast of Bagdad . The road was built by the late 1930s and improved during the late 1940s . Established as a state route in 1962 , SR 97 was paved in the early 1970s . In 2000 , the highway was officially added to the State Highway system . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The route begins at an intersection with US 93 northwest of Congress and southeast of Nothing . Beginning at US 93 southbound , SR 97 crosses US 93 northbound after several feet . It crosses through a desert region in a northeasterly direction , meeting a dirt road that connects back to US 93 . SR 97 curves northward before heading eastward at an intersection with Burro Creek Road . Again turning northeastward , the roadway meets various local roads , most of them dirt . The highway meets its northern terminus at SR 96 , which continues northwestward toward Bagdad . 
 The highway is maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation ( ADOT ) who is responsible for constructing and maintaining highways in the state . As part of this role , ADOT surveys volumes of traffic on their highways . These surveys are most often presented in the form of annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is the number of vehicles that travel a road during an average day during the year . In 2009 , ADOT calculated that an average of only 550 vehicles used the road daily . No part of the highway has been listed in the National Highway System , a system of roads in the United States important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = History = = 
 The section of the SR 97 northeast of Burro Creek Road had been built by 1939 . Between 1946 and 1951 , the section north of Burro Creek Road was improved and the section south built as a graded road . The road was logged as a state route in 1962 along its current routing , connecting SR 96 to the rest of the state highway system . The highway was then paved throughout its entirety in 1973 . In 2000 , the route was slightly realigned because of a widening project on US 93 from a two @-@ lane highway to a four @-@ lane divided highway . That same year , SR 97 officially became a State Highway .

 = Russula emetica = 
 Russula emetica , commonly known as the sickener , emetic russula , or vomiting russula , is a basidiomycete mushroom , and the type species of the genus Russula . It has a red , convex to flat cap up to 8 @.@ 5 cm ( 3 @.@ 3 in ) in diameter , with a cuticle that can be peeled off almost to the centre . The gills are white to pale cream , and closely spaced . A smooth white stem measures up to 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) long and 2 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 9 in ) thick . First described in 1774 , the mushroom has a wide distribution in the Northern Hemisphere , where it grows on the ground in damp woodlands in a mycorrhizal association with conifers , especially pine . 
 The mushroom 's common names refer to the gastrointestinal distress they cause when consumed raw . The flesh is extremely peppery , but this offensive taste , along with its toxicity , can be removed by parboiling or pickling . Although it used to be widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries , it is generally not recommended for consumption . There are many similar Russula species that have a red cap with white stem and gills , some of which can be reliably distinguished from R. emetica only by microscopic characteristics . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Russula emetica was first officially described as Agaricus <unk> by Jacob Christian Schaeffer in 1774 , in his series on fungi of Bavaria and the Palatinate , Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur <unk> . Christian Hendrik Persoon placed it in its current genus Russula in 1796 , where it remains . According to the nomenclatural database MycoBank , Agaricus russula is a synonym of R. emetica that was published by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772 , two years earlier than Schaeffer 's description . However , this name is unavailable as Persoon 's name is sanctioned . Additional synonyms include Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck 's Amanita rubra ( 1783 ) , and Augustin Pyramus de Candolle 's subsequent new combination Agaricus ruber ( 1805 ) . The specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek <unk> / <unk> ' emetic ' or ' vomit @-@ inducing ' . Similarly , its common names of sickener , emetic russula , and vomiting russula also refer to this attribute . 
 Russula emetica is the type species of the genus Russula . According to Rolf Singer 's infrageneric classification of Russula , it is also the type of the section Russula . In an alternative classification proposed by Henri Romagnesi , it is the type species of subsection <unk> . A molecular analysis of European Russula species determined that R. emetica groups in a clade with R. <unk> , R. <unk> , and R. nana ; a later analysis confirmed the close phylogenetic relationship between R. emetica and the latter two <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 The sticky cap of R. emetica is 2 @.@ 5 – 8 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) wide , with a shape ranging from convex ( in young specimens ) to flattened , sometimes with a central depression , and sometimes with a shallow umbo . It is a bright scarlet or cherry red , and in maturity , the margins have fine radial grooves extending 2 – 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 – 0 @.@ 3 in ) towards the center of the cap . The cuticle can be readily peeled from the cap almost to the centre . The brittle flesh is white ( or tinged with red directly under the cap cuticle ) , measures 4 – 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) thick , and has a very sharp and peppery taste . Gills are closely spaced , white to creamy @-@ white , and have an attachment to the stem ranging from adnate to adnexed or completely free . They are intervenose ( containing cross @-@ veins in the spaces between the gills ) and occasionally forked near the cap margin . Fruit bodies have a slightly fruity or spicy smell . 
 The white stem measures 4 @.@ 5 – 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 – 4 @.@ 1 in ) long by 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 9 in ) thick , and is roughly the same width throughout its length , although it can be a bit thicker near the base . Its surface is dry and smooth , sometimes marked by faint longitudinal grooves . It is either stuffed ( filled with a cottony pith ) or partially hollow , and lacks a ring or partial veil . 
 Russula emetica produces a white to yellowish @-@ white spore print . Spores are roughly elliptical to egg @-@ shaped , with a strongly warted and partially reticulate ( web @-@ like ) surface . They have dimensions of 8 @.@ 8 – 11 @.@ 0 by 6 @.@ 6 – 8 μm , and are amyloid , meaning that they will stain blue , bluish @-@ grey , to blackish in Melzer 's reagent . Basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , hyaline ( translucent ) , and measure 32 @.@ 9 – 50 by 9 @.@ 0 – 11 @.@ 6 μm . Cystidia located on the gill face ( pleurocystidia ) are somewhat cylindrical to club @-@ shaped or somewhat spindle @-@ shaped , and measure 35 – 88 by 7 @.@ 3 – 12 @.@ 4 μm . They are yellowish , and contain granular contents .

Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae . 
 The red pigments of this and other <unk> are water @-@ soluble to some degree , and fruit bodies will often bleach or fade with rain or sunlight ; the cap colour of older specimens may fade to pink or orange , or develop white blotches . The main pigment responsible for the red colour of the fruit bodies is called <unk> , but little is known of its chemical composition . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 As its name implies , the sickener is inedible , though not as dangerous as sometimes described in older mushroom guides . The symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature : nausea , diarrhoea , vomiting , and colicky abdominal cramps . These symptoms typically begin half an hour to three hours after ingestion of the mushroom , and usually subside spontaneously , or shortly after the ingested material has been expelled from the intestinal tract . The active agents have not been identified but are thought to be sesquiterpenes , which have been isolated from the related genus Lactarius and from Russula <unk> . <unk> that have been identified from R. emetica include the previously known compounds lactarorufin A , <unk> , <unk> , and an unnamed compound unique to this species . 
 The bitter taste does disappear on cooking and it is said to then be edible , though consumption is not recommended . The mushroom used to be widely eaten in eastern European countries and Russia after parboiling ( which removes the toxins ) , and then salting or pickling . In some regions of Hungary and Slovakia , the cap cuticle is removed and used as a spice for <unk> . Both the red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ) and the American red squirrel ( <unk> <unk> ) are known to forage for , store and eat R. emetica . Other creatures that have been documented consuming the mushroom include the snail <unk> <unk> , several species of slugs ( including Arion ater , A. subfuscus , A. intermedius , <unk> maximus , L. <unk> , and <unk> reticulatum ) , the fruit flies Drosophila <unk> and D. <unk> , and the fungus gnat <unk> <unk> .

 Russula emetica is one of over 100 red @-@ capped Russula species known worldwide . The related <unk> sickener ( R. nobilis ) is found under beech in Europe . Many , such as the bloody brittlegill ( R. <unk> ) , are inedible ; this species can be distinguished from R. emetica by the reddish flush in its stem . R. aurea , however , is edible . It has a yellow stem , gills and flesh under its red cap . The edible R. <unk> — common in mixed woods in the eastern and northern United States — has a wrinkled and pimpled cap cuticle , cream spores , and mild taste . Another inedible species , R. fragilis , has notched gills , and its stem stains blue with <unk> . The uncommon European subspecies R. emetica longipes is distinguished by its longer stem and ochre gills . The paler European mushroom R. <unk> , found in coniferous forests and moorland , is sometimes considered a subspecies of R. emetica . R. nana is restricted in distribution to arctic and subarctic highland meadows where dwarf willow ( Salix <unk> ) or alpine bearberry ( Arctostaphylos alpina ) are abundant . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Like all species of Russula , R. emetica is mycorrhizal , and forms mutually beneficial partnerships with roots of trees and certain herbaceous plants . Preferred host plants are conifers , especially pines . Fruit bodies grow singly , scattered , or in groups in sphagnum moss near bogs , and in coniferous and mixed forests . The fungus occasionally fruits on humus or on very rotten wood . The mushroom is known from North Africa , Asia , Europe , and North America , and can be locally very common . There is some doubt over the extent of its range in North America , as some sightings refer to the related R. <unk> ; initially the name " Russula emetica " was often applied to any red @-@ capped white Russula . Sightings in Australia are now referred to the similarly coloured R. <unk> . 
 A multi @-@ year field study of the growth of R. emetica production in a scots pine plantation in Scotland found that total productivity was 0 @.@ 24 – 0 @.@ 49 million mushrooms per hectare per year ( roughly 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 2 million mushrooms / acre / year ) , corresponding to a fresh weight of 265 – 460 kg per hectare per year ( 49 – 85 lb / acre / year ) . Productivity was highest from August to October . The longevity of the mushrooms was estimated to be 4 – 7 days . In a study of the fungal diversity of ectomycorrhizal species in a Sitka spruce forest , R. emetica was one of the top five dominant fungi . Comparing the frequency of fruit body production between 10- , 20- , 30- , or 40 @-@ year @-@ old forest stands , R. emetica was most prolific in the latter . 
 = Hey Jude = 
 " Hey Jude " is a song by the English rock band the Beatles , written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon – McCartney . The ballad evolved from " Hey Jules " , a song McCartney wrote to comfort John Lennon 's son , Julian , during his parents ' divorce . " Hey Jude " begins with a verse @-@ bridge structure incorporating McCartney 's vocal performance and piano accompaniment ; further instrumentation is added as the song progresses . After the fourth verse , the song shifts to a fade @-@ out coda that lasts for more than four minutes . 
 " Hey Jude " was released in August 1968 as the first single from the Beatles ' record label Apple Records . More than seven minutes in length , it was at the time the longest single ever to top the British charts . It also spent nine weeks at number one in the United States , the longest for any Beatles single . " Hey Jude " tied the " all @-@ time " record , at the time , for the longest run at the top of the US charts . The single has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on professional critics ' lists of the greatest songs of all time . In 2013 , Billboard named it the 10th biggest song of all time .

 In May 1968 , John Lennon and his wife Cynthia Lennon separated because of John 's affair with Yoko Ono . The following month , Paul McCartney drove out to visit Cynthia and John 's son , Julian , at Kenwood , the family 's home in Weybridge . Cynthia had been part of the Beatles ' social circle since before the band 's rise to fame in 1963 ; McCartney later said he found it " a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non <unk> and out of my life " . Cynthia Lennon recalled of McCartney 's surprise visit : " I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed ' Hey Jude ' in the car . I will never forget Paul 's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us . " 
 The song 's original title was " Hey Jules " , and it was intended to comfort Julian Lennon from the stress of his parents ' separation . McCartney later said , " I knew it was not going to be easy for him " , and that he changed the name to " Jude " " because I thought that sounded a bit better " . 
 According to music journalist Chris Hunt , in the weeks after writing the song , McCartney " test [ ed ] his latest composition on anyone too polite to refuse . And that meant everyone . " On 30 June , after recording the Black Dyke Mills Band 's rendition of his instrumental " Thingumybob " , in Yorkshire , McCartney stopped at a village in Bedfordshire and performed " Hey Jude " at a local pub . He also regaled members of the Bonzo Dog Band with the song while producing their single " I 'm the Urban Spaceman " , in London , and interrupted a recording session by the Barron Knights to do the same . Ron Griffith of the group the Iveys – soon to be known as Badfinger and , like the Black Dyke Mills Band , an early signing to the Beatles ' new record label Apple Records – later recalled that on their first day in the studio , McCartney " gave us a full concert rendition of ' Hey Jude ' " . 
 When introducing the composition to Lennon , McCartney assured him that he would " fix " the line " the movement you need is on your shoulder " , reasoning that " it 's a stupid expression ; it sounds like a parrot . " Lennon replied : " You won 't , you know . That 's the best line in the song . " McCartney retained the phrase ; he later said of his subsequent live performances of the song : " that 's the line when I think of John , and sometimes I get a little emotional during that moment . " 
 Although McCartney originally wrote " Hey Jude " for Julian , John Lennon thought it had actually been written for him . In a 1980 interview , Lennon stated that he " always heard it as a song to me " and contended that , on one level , McCartney was giving his blessing to Lennon and Ono 's relationship , while , on another , he was disappointed to be usurped as Lennon 's friend and songwriting partner . 
 Other people believed McCartney wrote the song about them , including Judith Simons , a journalist with the Daily Express . Still others , including Lennon , have speculated that in the lyrics to " Hey Jude " , McCartney 's failing long @-@ term relationship with Jane Asher provided an unconscious " message to himself " . McCartney and Asher had announced their engagement on 25 December 1967 , yet he began an affair with Linda Eastman in June 1968 ; that same month , Francie Schwartz , an American who was in London to discuss a film proposal with Apple , began living with McCartney at his St John 's Wood home . When Lennon mentioned that he thought the song was about him and Ono , McCartney denied it and told Lennon he had written the song about himself . 
 Author Mark Hertsgaard has commented that " many of the song 's lyrics do seem directed more at a grown man on the verge of a powerful new love , especially the lines ' you have found her now go and get her ' and ' you 're waiting for someone to perform with . ' " Music critic and author Tim Riley writes : " If the song is about self @-@ worth and self @-@ consolation in the face of hardship , the vocal performance itself conveys much of the journey . He begins by singing to comfort someone else , finds himself weighing his own feelings in the process , and finally , in the repeated refrains that nurture his own approbation , he comes to believe in himself .

 Having earmarked the song for release as a single , the Beatles recorded " Hey Jude " during the sessions for their self @-@ titled double album , commonly known as " the White Album " . The sessions were marked by an element of discord within the group for the first time , partly as a result of Ono 's constant presence at Lennon 's side , and also reflective of the four band members ' divergence following their communal trip to Rishikesh in the spring of 1968 to study Transcendental Meditation . Author Peter Doggett describes the completed version of " Hey Jude " as a song that " glowed with optimism after a summer that had burned with anxiety and rage within the group " . 
 The Beatles first taped 25 takes of the song at EMI 's Abbey Road Studios in London over two nights , 29 and 30 July 1968 , with George Martin as their producer . These dates served as rehearsals , however , since they planned to record the master track at Trident Studios to utilise their eight @-@ track recording machine ( Abbey Road was still limited to four @-@ tracks ) . A take from 29 July , which author and critic Kenneth Womack describes as a " jovial " session , was issued on the Anthology 3 compilation in 1996 . 
 The 30 July rehearsals were filmed for a short documentary titled Music ! The film shows only three of the Beatles performing " Hey Jude " , however , since George Harrison remained in the studio control room , with Martin and EMI recording engineer Ken Scott . Author Simon Leng views this as indicative of how Harrison was increasingly allowed little room to develop ideas on McCartney compositions , whereas he was free to create empathetic guitar parts for Lennon 's songs of the period . 
 During the rehearsals that day , Harrison and McCartney had a heated disagreement over the lead guitar part for the song . Harrison 's idea was to play a guitar phrase as a response to each line of the vocal , which did not fit with McCartney 's conception of the song 's arrangement , and he vetoed it . In a 1994 interview , McCartney said , " looking back on it , I think , Okay . Well , it was bossy , but it was ballsy of me , because I could have bowed to the pressure . " Ron Richards , a record producer who worked for Martin at both Parlophone and AIR Studios , said McCartney was " oblivious to anyone else 's feelings in the studio " , and that he was driven to making the best possible record , at almost any cost . 
 = = = Trident Studios recording = = = 
 The master track for " Hey Jude " was recorded at Trident Studios on 31 July . Trident 's founder , Norman Sheffield , recalled that Mal Evans , the Beatles ' aide and former roadie , insisted that some pot plants he had brought be placed in the studio to make the place " soft " , consistent with the band 's wishes . Sheffield served as recording engineer for the session . The line @-@ up on the basic track was McCartney on piano and lead vocal , Lennon on acoustic guitar , Harrison on electric guitar , and Ringo Starr on drums . 
 The Beatles recorded four takes of " Hey Jude " , the first of which was selected as the master . With drums absent for the first 50 seconds of the song , McCartney began this take unaware that Starr had just left for a toilet break . Starr soon returned – " tiptoeing past my back rather quickly " , in McCartney 's recollection – and performed his cue perfectly . McCartney added : " his timing was absolutely impeccable . " 
 On 1 August , the group carried out overdubs on the basic track , again at Trident . These additions included McCartney 's lead vocal and bass guitar ; backing vocals from Lennon , McCartney and Harrison ; and tambourine , played by Starr . They then added a 36 @-@ piece orchestra over the long coda , scored by Martin . The orchestra consisted of ten violins , three violas , three cellos , two flutes , one contra bassoon , one bassoon , two clarinets , one contra bass clarinet , four trumpets , four trombones , two horns , percussion and two string basses . With the introduction of what musicologist Walter Everett terms the " bottom @-@ heavy " orchestral instruments , particularly the string basses , McCartney 's bass part was cut from the start of the coda onwards . 
 According to Sheffield , there was dissension initially among the orchestral musicians , some of whom " were looking down their noses at the Beatles , I think " . Sheffield recalls that McCartney ensured their cooperation by demanding : " Do you guys want to get fucking paid or not ? " During the first few takes , McCartney was unhappy about the lack of energy and passion in the orchestra 's performance , so he stood up on the grand piano and started conducting the musicians from there . 
 The Beatles then asked the orchestra members if they would clap their hands and sing along to the refrain in the coda . All but one of the musicians complied ( for a double fee ) , with the abstainer reportedly saying , " I 'm not going to clap my hands and sing Paul McCartney 's bloody song ! " Apple Records assistant Chris O 'Dell says she joined the cast of backing singers on the song ; one of the label 's first signings , Jackie Lomax , also recalled participating . 
 Trident was paid £ 25 per hour by EMI for the " Hey Jude " sessions . Sheffield said that the studio earned about £ 1000 in total at the time , but by having the Beatles record there , and in turn raving about the facility , the value was incalculable . The band carried out further work at Trident during 1968 , and Apple artists such as Lomax , Mary Hopkin , Billy Preston and the Iveys all recorded there over the next year . 
 = = = Mixing = = = 
 Scott , Martin and the Beatles mixed the finished recording at Abbey Road . The transfer of the Trident master tape to acetate proved problematic due to the recording sounding murky when played back on EMI 's equipment . The issue was resolved with the help of Geoff Emerick , whom Scott had recently replaced as the Beatles ' principal recording engineer . Emerick happened to be visiting Abbey Road , having recently refused to work with the Beatles any longer , due to the tension and abuse that had become commonplace at their recording sessions . A stereo mix of " Hey Jude " was then completed on 2 August and the mono version on 8 August . 
 Everett writes that the song 's " most commented @-@ on feature " is its considerable length , at 7 : 11 . The precedent for issuing such a long track on a single had recently been set by Richard Harris ' hit recording of " MacArthur Park " , the composer of which , Jimmy Webb , was a visitor to the studio around this time . According to Webb , Martin admitted to him that " Hey Jude " was only allowed to run over seven minutes because of the success of " MacArthur Park " . 
 In the song 's final bridge section , at 2 : 58 , the spoken phrase " Fucking hell ! " appears . Scott admits that although he was told about it , he could not hear the words originally . Lennon attributed the expletive to McCartney , according to Emerick , who reports Lennon 's comment in his autobiography : " ' Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word , ' Lennon gleefully crowed , ' but I insisted we leave it in [ at Trident ] , buried just low enough so that it can barely be heard . Most people won 't ever spot it ... but we 'll know it 's there . ' " Womack considers that the expletive was actually uttered by Lennon . Malcolm Toft , the mix engineer on the Trident recording , also attributes it to Lennon . In Toft 's recollection , Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when , in reaction to the volume being too loud in his headphones , he first called out " Whoa ! " then , two seconds later , swore as he pulled the headphones off . 
 = = Composition and structure = = 
 " Hey Jude " begins with McCartney singing lead vocals and playing the piano . The patterns he plays are based on three chords : F , C , and B ♭ ( I , V and IV ) . The main chord progression is " flipped on its head " , in Hertsgaard 's words , for the coda , since the C chord is replaced by E ♭ . Everett comments that McCartney 's melody over the verses borrows in part from John Ireland 's 1907 liturgical piece Te Deum , as well as ( with the first change to a B ♭ chord ) suggesting the influence of the Drifters ' 1960 hit " Save the Last Dance for Me " . 
 The second verse of the song adds accompaniment from acoustic guitar and tambourine . Tim Riley writes that , with the " restrained tom @-@ tom and cymbal fill " that introduces the drum part , " the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord , making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ( ' And any time you feel the pain ' ) . " At the end of each bridge , McCartney sings a brief phrase ( " Na @-@ na @-@ na na … " ) , supported by an electric guitar fill , before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse . According to Riley , this vocal phrase serves to " reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside " . Additional musical details , such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal , are added to sustain interest throughout the four @-@ verse , two @-@ bridge song . 
 The verse @-@ bridge structure persists for approximately three minutes , after which the band leads into a four @-@ minute @-@ long coda , consisting of nineteen rounds of the song 's double plagal cadence . During this coda , the rest of the band , backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals , repeats the phrase " Na @-@ na @-@ na na " followed by the words " hey Jude " until the song gradually fades out . In his analysis of the composition , musicologist Alan Pollack comments on the unusual structure of " Hey Jude " , in that it uses a " binary form that combines a fully developed , hymn @-@ like song together with an extended , mantra @-@ like jam on a simple chord progression " . 
 Riley considers that the coda 's repeated chord sequence ( I- ♭ VII @-@ IV @-@ I ) " answers all the musical questions raised at the beginnings and ends of bridges " , since " The flat seventh that posed dominant turns into bridges now has an entire chord built on it . " This three @-@ chord refrain allows McCartney " a bedding ... to leap about on vocally " , so he ad @-@ libs his vocal performance for the rest of the song . In Riley 's estimation , the song " becomes a tour of Paul 's vocal range : from the graceful inviting tones of the opening verse , through the mounting excitement of the song itself , to the surging raves of the coda " . 
 = = Release = = 
 " Hey Jude " was released on 26 August 1968 in the United States and 30 August in the United Kingdom , backed with " Revolution " on the B @-@ side of a 7 " single . It was one of four singles issued simultaneously to launch Apple Records – the others being Mary Hopkin 's " Those Were the Days " , Jackie Lomax 's " Sour Milk Sea " , and the Black Dyke Mills Band 's " Thingumybob " . In advance of the release date , Apple declared 11 – 18 August to be " National Apple Week " in the UK , and sent gift @-@ wrapped boxes of the records , marked " Our First Four " , to Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family , and to the British prime minister . The release was promoted by Derek Taylor , who , in Doggett 's description , " hyped the first Apple records with typical elan " . " Hey Jude " was the first of the four singles , since it was still designated as an EMI / Parlophone release in the UK and a Capitol release in the US , but with the Apple Records logo now added . In the US , " Hey Jude " was the first Beatles single to be issued in a company sleeve rather than a picture sleeve . 
 Lennon wanted " Revolution " to be the A @-@ side of the single , but the other Beatles did not agree . In his 1970 interview with Rolling Stone , he said " Hey Jude " was worthy of an A @-@ side , " but we could have had both . " In 1980 , he told Playboy he still disagreed with the decision . 
 The single was a highly successful debut for Apple Records , and contrasted with the public embarrassment the band faced after the recent closure of their short @-@ lived retail venture , Apple Boutique . " Hey Jude " began its sixteen @-@ week run on Britain 's official singles chart on 7 September 1968 , claiming the top spot a week later . It lasted two weeks on top before being replaced by Hopkin 's " Those Were the Days " , which was produced by McCartney . " Hey Jude " was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) on 13 September ; that same week , NME reported that two million copies of the single had been sold . The song entered the Billboard Hot 100 in the US on 14 September , beginning a nineteen @-@ week chart run there . It reached number one on 28 September and held that position for nine weeks , for three of which , " Those Were the Days " held the number @-@ two spot . This was the longest time spent by a Beatles single at number one , as well as being the longest @-@ playing single to reach number one . The song was the 16th number @-@ one hit for the band in America , tying Elvis Presley 's record at the time for most number @-@ one songs there . Billboard ranked it as the number @-@ one song for 1968 . 
 In the UK , where " MacArthur Park " had failed to top the chart , " Hey Jude " remained the longest number @-@ one hit for nearly a quarter of a century . It was surpassed in 1993 by Meat Loaf 's " I 'd Do Anything for Love ( But I Won 't Do That ) " , which ran to 7 : 52 as a single . 
 On 30 November 1968 , NME reported that sales had reached nearly six million copies worldwide . " Hey Jude " became the biggest @-@ selling debut release for a record label ever , selling an estimated eight million copies worldwide and topping the charts in eleven countries . In 1999 , it was certified 4x platinum by the RIAA , representing four million units shipped in the US . 
 = = Promotion = = 
 A failed early promotional attempt for the single took place after the Beatles ' all @-@ night recording session on 7 – 8 August 1968 . With Apple Boutique having closed a week before , McCartney and his girlfriend , Francie Schwartz , painted Hey Jude / Revolution across its large , whitewashed shop windows . The words were mistaken for anti @-@ Semitic graffiti ( since Jude means " Jew " in German ) , leading to complaints from the local Jewish community , and the windows being smashed by passers @-@ by . Discussing the episode in The Beatles Anthology , McCartney explained that he had been motivated by the location – " Great opportunity . Baker Street , millions of buses going around … " – and added : " I had no idea it meant ' Jew ' , but if you look at footage of Nazi Germany , ' Juden Raus ' was written in whitewashed windows with a Star of David . I swear it never occurred to me . " According to Barry Miles , McCartney caused further controversy in his comments to Alan Smith of the NME that month when he said : " Starvation in India doesn 't worry me one bit , not one iota … And it doesn 't worry you , if you 're honest . You just pose . " 
 The Beatles hired Michael Lindsay @-@ Hogg to shoot a promotional film for " Hey Jude " , after he had previously directed a clip for " Paperback Writer " in 1966 . They settled on the idea of filming with a live , albeit controlled audience . In the film , the Beatles are first seen by themselves , performing the initial chorus and verses , and then are joined by the audience who appear as the last chorus concludes and coda begins ; the audience sings and claps along with the Beatles through the song 's conclusion . Hogg shot the film at Twickenham Film Studios on 4 September 1968 , with McCartney himself designing the set . Tony Bramwell , a friend of the Beatles , later described the set as " the piano , there ; drums , there ; and orchestra in two tiers at the back . " The event marked Starr 's return to the group , after McCartney 's criticism of his drumming had led to him walking out during a session for the White Album track " Back in the U.S.S.R. " During his two @-@ week absence , Starr announced that he had left the band . 
 The final film was a combination of several different takes and included filmed " introductions " to the song by David Frost ( who introduced the Beatles as " the greatest tea @-@ room orchestra in the world " ) , and Cliff Richard , for their respective , eponymous TV programmes . As filming wore on , Lennon repeatedly asked Lindsay @-@ Hogg if he had the footage he needed . After twelve takes , McCartney said , " I think that 's enough " , and filming concluded . It was first aired in the UK on Frost on Sunday on 8 September 1968 , and the film was later broadcast for the United States on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour on 6 October . According to Riley , the showing on Frost on Sunday " kicked ' Hey Jude ' into the stratosphere " in terms of popularity . Hertsgaard pairs it with the release of the animated film Yellow Submarine as two events that created " a state of nirvana " for Beatles fans , in contrast with the problems besetting the band regarding Ono 's influence and Apple . 
 The 4 September 1968 promo film is included in the Beatles ' 2015 video compilation 1 , while the three @-@ disc versions of that compilation , titled 1 + , also include an alternate video , with a different introduction and vocal , from the same date .

 Upon the single 's release , Derek Johnson of the NME wrote : " The intriguing features of ' Hey Jude ' are its extreme length and the 40 @-@ piece orchestral accompaniment – and personally I would have preferred it without either ! " While he viewed the track overall as " a beautiful , compelling song " , and the first three minutes as " absolutely sensational " , Johnson rued the long coda 's " vocal improvisations on the basically repetitive four @-@ bar chorus " . Time magazine described the coda as " a fadeout that engagingly spoofs the fadeout as a gimmick for ending pop records " . The same reviewer contrasted " Hey Jude " with its B @-@ side , " Revolution " , saying that " The other side of the new disk urges activism of a different sort " , due to McCartney " <unk> exhort [ ing ] a friend to overcome his fears and commit himself in love " . Rolling Stone also attributed the song 's meaning as a message from McCartney to Lennon to end his negative relationships with women : " to break the old pattern ; to really go through with love " . Other commentators interpreted " Hey Jude " as being directed at Bob Dylan , then semi @-@ retired in Woodstock . 
 Writing in 1971 , Robert Christgau of The Village Voice called it " one of [ McCartney 's ] truest and most forthright love songs " and was critical of its omission from the album The Beatles . In their 1975 book The Beatles : An Illustrated Record , critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler wrote that " Hey Jude " " promised great things " for the ill @-@ conceived Apple enterprise and described the song as " the last great Beatles single recorded specifically for the 45s market " . They noted also that " the epic proportions of the piece " encouraged many imitators , yet these other artists " [ failed ] to capture the gentleness and sympathy of the Beatles ' communal feel " . 
 Among more recent commentators , Alan Pollack admires " Hey Jude " as " such a good illustration of two compositional lessons – how to fill a large canvas with simple means , and how to use diverse elements such as harmony , bassline , and orchestration to articulate form and contrast . " Pollack considers that the song 's long coda provides " an astonishingly transcendental effect " , while AllMusic 's Richie Unterberger similarly opines : " What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic because McCartney varies the vocal with some of the greatest nonsense scatting ever heard in rock … " In his book Revolution in the Head , Ian MacDonald wrote that the " pseudo @-@ soul shrieking in the fade @-@ out may be a blemish " but he praised the song as " a pop / rock hybrid drawing on the best of both idioms " . MacDonald concluded : " ' Hey Jude ' strikes a universal note , touching on an archetypal moment in male sexual psychology with a gentle wisdom one might properly call inspired . " Lennon said the song was " one of [ McCartney 's ] masterpieces " .

 Julian Lennon discovered that " Hey Jude " had been written for him almost twenty years after McCartney composed the song . He recalled of his and McCartney 's relationship : " Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit – more than Dad and I did . We had a great friendship going and there seems to be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad . " In 1996 , Julian paid £ 25 @,@ 000 for the recording notes to " Hey Jude " at an auction . He spent a further £ 35 @,@ 000 at the auction , buying John Lennon memorabilia . John Cousins , Julian Lennon 's manager , stated at the time : " He has a few photographs of his father , but not very much else . He is collecting for personal reasons ; these are family heirlooms if you like . " 
 In 2002 , the original handwritten lyrics for the song were nearly auctioned off at Christie 's in London . The sheet of notepaper with the scrawled lyrics had been expected to fetch up to £ 80 @,@ 000 at the auction , which was scheduled for 30 April 2002 . McCartney went to court to stop the auction , claiming the paper had disappeared from his West London home . Richard Morgan , representing Christie 's , said McCartney had provided no evidence that he had ever owned the piece of paper on which the lyrics were written . The courts decided in McCartney 's favour and prohibited the sale of the lyrics . They had been sent to Christie 's for auction by Frenchman <unk> Tessier , who said he purchased the piece of paper at a street market stall in London for £ 10 in the early 1970s . In the original catalogue for the auction , Julian Lennon had written , " It 's very strange to think that someone has written a song about you . It still touches me . "

 " Hey Jude " was one of the few Beatles songs that Elvis Presley covered , when he rehearsed the track at his 1969 Memphis sessions with producer Chips Moman , a recording that appeared on the 1972 album Elvis Now . A medley of the Beatles ' " Yesterday " and " Hey Jude " was included on the 1999 reissue of Presley 's 1970 live album On Stage . 
 A 1968 cover by Wilson Pickett attracted success and attention for the guitar work , by a young Duane Allman . Eric Clapton commented , " I remember hearing [ it ] and calling either Ahmet Ertegun or Tom Dowd and saying , ' Who 's that guitar player ? ' ... To this day , I 've never heard better rock guitar playing on an R & B record . It 's the best . " 
 " Weird Al " Yankovic included " Hey Jude " in his first polka medley , " Polkas on 45 " , from his 1984 album " Weird Al " Yankovic in 3 @-@ D. Katy Perry performed a cover of the song as part of the 2012 MusiCares Person of the Year concert honouring McCartney . 
 Paul McCartney sang the song in the closing moments of the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics hosted in London . On 4 August 2012 , McCartney led the crowd in a rendition of " Hey Jude " while watching cycling at the velodrome .

 = Green Versace dress of Jennifer Lopez = 
 American recording artist and actress Jennifer Lopez wore an exotic green Versace silk chiffon dress to the 42nd Grammy Awards ceremony on February 23 , 2000 . The sheer fabric was printed with a tropical leaf and bamboo pattern , and cut with a very low neckline extending well past Lopez 's navel , while the waist of the dress was studded with <unk> . 
 This garment instantly received significant global media coverage , and has been cited along with Elizabeth Hurley 's black Versace dress as one of the most high @-@ profile dresses that made the designer Versace a household name . In addition , this dress was described as a turning point in designer Donatella Versace 's career after the death of her brother Gianni Versace . It was chosen by the fashion journalist Lisa Armstrong to represent 2000 in the Fashion Museum of Bath 's Dress of the Year collection , at which point it was described as a key example of the close relationship between fashions , celebrities and publicity . Another duplicate is displayed at The Grammy Museum while as of 2015 , Lopez still owns the original gown . In 2015 , fifteen years since Lopez first wore it , the dress is still inextricably associated with her and Versace . 
 = = Background = = 
 Before becoming famous on the red carpet of the Grammy Awards , the dress was presented on the catwalk by model Amber Valletta and was also featured in Versace 's main advertising campaign that year ; Steven Meisel also photographed it on Valletta . Andrea Lieberman , Lopez 's stylist at the time , remarked , " Versace and Jennifer [ Lopez ] belonged together . It was really natural . " 
 In 2000 , the dress had a market value of about $ 15 @,@ 000 . Spice Girl Geri Halliwell wore the same dress to the NRJ Music Awards in France in January 2000 , around a month before Jennifer Lopez wore it ; however , in doing so she failed to receive the same amount of global attention as Lopez did . The designer herself also wore it to a Met Gala on 6 December 1999 . 
 Lopez arrived on the red carpet of the 42nd Grammy Awards in the company of then @-@ boyfriend Sean Combs ; he was dressed in a gray suit . Although the fashion house Versace had only loaned the dress , it subsequently decided to give it away as a token of gratitude for the enormous publicity generated . The singer immediately monopolized the attention and curiosity of the public and photographers at the event . Actor David Duchovny appeared on stage with Lopez to present the award for Best R & B Album and declared to the audience , " This is the first time in five or six years that I 'm sure that nobody is looking at me " , eliciting laughter from the audience and Lopez .

 Designed by Donatella Versace , it has been described as " jungle green " , " sea green " or " tropical " green , a green dress with touches of blue to give an exotic appearance . It is a see @-@ through silk chiffon dress with a tropical leaf and bamboo pattern , with a citrine @-@ studded crotch . The dress " had a low @-@ cut neck that extended several inches below her navel , where it was loosely fastened with a sparkly brooch and then opened out again , " exposing her midriff and then cut along the front of the legs like a bath robe . The dress then drooped behind her on the floor , open at the back . Under the suit , Lopez wore a pair of nude @-@ tone shorts and only afterwards it was revealed that Lopez was able to keep the dress on using double @-@ sided fashion tape . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The dress was discussed by those in the fashion and entertainment for weeks after the event , with dedicated television specials and magazine covers featuring her . Images of Lopez in the green dress were downloaded from the Grammy website 642 @,@ 917 times in just 24 hours after the event . The dress has been cited along with the Black Versace dress of Elizabeth Hurley as being those most iconic dresses which made Versace a household name . Vibe magazine said , " Jen Lo made Donatella Versace 's diaphanous green fabric a national call to arms . " Others have argued that the dress led to Lopez becoming " one of the most glamorous and publicity @-@ friendly icons of the red carpet . " 
 Lopez was surprised by the enormous media coverage , declaring in an interview : " It was a nice dress . I had no idea it was going to become such a big deal . " Versace later revealed that the dress was the turning point of her career , saying that the media now had confidence in her own work , after the death of Gianni Versace . She declared to the Canadian press , " It was an unexpected success . The next day she [ Jennifer Lopez ] was everywhere and people were talking about her in that dress . It was one of those moments like the one that Gianni [ Versace ] had with Elizabeth Hurley and clothes @-@ pins . " The dress has been referred to many times as " notorious " and " infamous " because of its boldness . 
 At the 72nd Academy Awards in March 2000 , South Park co @-@ creator Trey Parker wore an imitation of the dress . 
 The Fashion Museum , Bath asked Lisa Armstrong of the Times to choose an outfit to represent 2000 for their " Dress of the Year " collection . While Armstrong initially considered choosing Hussein Chalayan 's table dress , she eventually decided on the Versace dress , arguing that due to the media attention it had received through being worn by Lopez , Geri Halliwell , and others , the gown represented " some kind of high water mark in the current symbiosis between fashion and celebrity . " Versace subsequently donated a duplicate of the dress to the Museum . Another duplicate is displayed at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles . As of 2015 , the original dress remains in Lopez 's possession . 
 On October 15 , 2002 at the Radio City Music Hall in New York , Jennifer Lopez was awarded the VH1 Vogue Fashion Award as the most influential star of the year . The award was presented by Versace herself . 
 In a poll by Debenhams , published in the Daily Telegraph in 2008 , the dress was voted the fifth most iconic dress of all time . 
 In January 2015 , Google 's president Eric Schmidt cited the massive attention to this dress as a motivation for the creation of Google Images search . In 2000 , Google Search results were limited to simple pages of text with links , but the developers worked on developing this further , realising that an image search was required to answer " the most popular search query " they had seen to date : Jennifer Lopez 's green dress . As a result of this , Google Images search was born . 
 = Doune Castle = 
 Doune Castle is a medieval stronghold near the village of Doune , in the Stirling district of central Scotland . The castle is sited on a wooded bend where the Ardoch Burn flows into the River Teith . It lies 8 miles ( 13 km ) north @-@ west of Stirling , where the Teith flows into the River Forth . Upstream , 8 miles ( 13 km ) further north @-@ west , the town of Callander lies at the edge of the Trossachs , on the fringe of the Scottish Highlands . 
 Recent research has shown that Doune Castle was originally built in the thirteenth century , then probably damaged in the Scottish Wars of Independence , before being rebuilt in its present form in the late 14th century by Robert Stewart , Duke of Albany ( c.1340 – 1420 ) , the son of King Robert II of Scotland , and Regent of Scotland from 1388 until his death . Duke Robert 's stronghold has survived relatively unchanged and complete , and the whole castle was traditionally thought of as the result of a single period of construction at this time . The castle passed to the crown in 1425 , when Albany 's son was executed , and was used as a royal hunting lodge and dower house . In the later 16th century , Doune became the property of the Earls of Moray . The castle saw military action during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Glencairn 's rising in the mid @-@ 17th century , and during the Jacobite Risings of the late 17th century and 18th century . By 1800 the castle was ruined , but restoration works were carried out in the 1880s , prior to its passing into state care in the 20th century . It is now maintained by Historic Scotland . 
 Due to the status of its builder , Doune reflected current ideas of what a royal castle building should be . It was planned as a courtyard with ranges of buildings on each side , although only the northern and north @-@ western buildings were completed . These comprise a large tower house over the entrance , containing the rooms of the Lord and his family , and a separate tower containing the kitchen and guest rooms . The two are linked by the great hall . The stonework is almost all from the late 14th century , with only minor repairs carried out in the 1580s . The restoration of the 1880s replaced the timber roofs and internal floors , as well as interior fittings . 
 = = History = = 
 The site at the confluence of the Ardoch Burn and the River Teith had been fortified by the Romans in the 1st century AD , although no remains are visible above ground . Ramparts and ditches to the south of the present castle may be the site of an earlier fortification , as the name Doune , derived from Gaelic <unk> , meaning " fort " , suggests . The earliest identifiable work in the castle dates from the thirteenth century , but it assumed its present form during one of the most creative and productive periods of Scottish medieval architecture , between 1375 and 1425 , when numerous castles were being built and remodelled , including Dirleton and Tantallon in Lothian , and Bothwell in Lanarkshire . 
 = = = Regent Albany = = = 
 In 1361 , Robert Stewart ( c.1340 – 1420 ) , son of King Robert II ( reigned 1371 – 1390 ) , and brother of King Robert III ( reigned 1390 – 1406 ) , was created Earl of Menteith , and was granted the lands on which Doune Castle now stands . Building may have started any time after this , and the castle was at least partially complete in 1381 , when a charter was sealed here . Robert was appointed Regent in 1388 for his elderly father , and continued to hold effective power during the reign of his infirm brother . He was created Duke of Albany in 1398 . In 1406 , Robert III 's successor , James I , was captured by the English , and Albany became Regent once more . After this time , the number of charters issued at Doune suggest that the castle became a favoured residence . 
 = = = Royal retreat = = = 
 Albany died in 1420 , and Doune , the dukedom of Albany , and the Regency all passed to his son Murdoch ( 1362 – 1425 ) . The ransom for James I was finally paid to the English , and the King returned in 1424 , taking immediate steps to gain control of his kingdom . Albany and two of his sons were imprisoned for treason , and then executed in May 1425 . Doune Castle became a royal possession , under an appointed Captain , or Keeper , and served as a retreat and hunting lodge for the Scottish monarchs . It was also used as a dower house by Mary of Guelders ( <unk> – 1463 ) , Margaret of Denmark ( 1456 – 1486 ) , and Margaret Tudor ( 1489 – 1541 ) , the widowed consorts of James II , James III and James IV respectively . 
 In 1528 , Margaret Tudor , now Regent of Scotland for her infant son James V , married Henry Stewart , 1st Lord Methven , a descendant of Albany . His brother , Sir James Stewart ( <unk> – 1554 ) , was made Captain of Doune Castle , and Sir James ' son , also James ( <unk> – 1590 ) , was created Lord Doune in 1570 . Lord Doune 's son , another James ( <unk> – 1592 ) , married Elizabeth Stuart , 2nd Countess of Moray around 1580 , becoming Earl of Moray himself . The castle thus came to be the seat of its keepers , the Earls of Moray , who owned it until the 20th century . 
 Mary , Queen of Scots , ( reigned 1542 – 1567 ) stayed at Doune on several occasions , occupying the suite of rooms above the kitchen . Doune was held by forces loyal to Mary during the brief civil war which followed her forced abdication in 1567 , but the garrison surrendered to the Regent , Matthew Stewart , 4th Earl of Lennox , in 1570 , after a three @-@ day blockade . George Buchanan and Duncan Nairn , Deputy Sherriff of Stirling presided over the torture and interrogation of a messenger , John Moon , at Doune on 4 October 1570 . Moon was carrying letters to Mary , Queen of Scots and Mary Seton . 
 King James VI visited Doune on occasion , and in 1581 authorised £ 300 to be spent on repairs and improvements , the works being carried out by the master mason Michael Ewing under the supervision of Robert Drummond of <unk> , Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland . In 1593 , a plot against James was discovered , and the King surprised the conspirators , who included the Earls of Montrose and Gowrie , at Doune Castle . 
 = = = Prison and garrison = = = 
 In 1607 , the minister , John Munro of Tain , a dissenter against the religious plans of James VI , was imprisoned with a fellow minister at Doune , though he escaped with the contrivance of the then Constable of the Castle , who was subsequently imprisoned for aiding the dissenters . The Royalist James Graham , 1st Marquess of Montrose occupied Doune Castle in 1645 , during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms . In 1654 , during Glencairn 's rising against the occupation of Scotland by Oliver Cromwell , a skirmish took place at Doune between Royalists under Sir Mungo Murray , and Cromwellian troops under Major Tobias Bridge . The castle was garrisoned by government troops during the Jacobite Rising of Bonnie Dundee in 1689 , when repairs were ordered , and again during the rising of 1715 . During the Jacobite Rising of 1745 , Doune Castle was occupied by Charles Edward Stuart , " Bonnie Prince Charlie " , and his Jacobite Highlanders . It was used as a prison for government troops captured at the Battle of Falkirk . Several prisoners , held in the rooms above the kitchen , escaped by knotting together bedsheets and climbing from the window . Escapees included the author John Home , and a minister , John Witherspoon , who later moved to the American colonies and became a signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence . 
 = = = Ruin and restoration = = = 
 The castle deteriorated through the 18th century , and by 1800 Doune was a roofless ruin . It remained so until the 1880s , when George Stuart , 14th Earl of Moray ( 1816 – 1895 ) began repair works . The timber roofs were replaced , and the interiors , including the panelling in the Lord 's Hall , were installed . The castle is now maintained by Historic Scotland , having been donated to a predecessor organisation by Douglas Stuart , 20th Earl of Moray , in 1984 , and is open to the public . The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument , and is a Category A listed building , the highest levels of protection for nationally important built heritage in Scotland . 
 = = Description = = 
 Doune occupies a strategic site , close to the geographical centre of Scotland , and only 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) from Stirling Castle , the " crossroads of Scotland " . The site is naturally defended on three sides by steeply @-@ sloping ground , and by the two rivers to east and west . The castle forms an irregular pentagon in plan , with buildings along the north and north @-@ west sides enclosing a courtyard . It is entered from the north via a passage beneath a tower containing the principal rooms of the castle . From the courtyard , three sets of stone external stairs , which may be later additions , lead up to the Lord 's Hall in the tower , to the adjacent Great Hall , and to the kitchens in a second tower to the west . 
 The main approach , from the north , is defended by earthworks , comprising three ditches , with a rampart , or earthen wall , between . Also outside the castle walls is a vaulted passage , traditionally said to lead into the castle , but in fact accessing an 18th @-@ century ice house . There are no openings within the lower part of the castle 's walls , excepting the entrance and the postern , or side gate , to the west , although there are relatively large windows on the upper storeys . Windows in the south wall suggest that further buildings were intended within the courtyard , but were never built . The stonework is of coursed sandstone rubble , with dressings in lighter <unk> stone . 
 = = = The Lord 's tower = = = 
 The principal tower , or gatehouse , is rectangular in plan 18 metres ( 59 ft ) by 13 metres ( 43 ft ) , and almost 29 metres ( 95 ft ) high , with a projecting round tower on the north @-@ east corner , beside the entrance . It comprises the Lord 's Hall , and three storeys of chambers above , located over the entrance passage . The vaulted , cobbled passage , 14 metres ( 46 ft ) long , was formerly defended by two sets of timber doors , and a yett , or hinged iron grille , remains . <unk> on either side overlook the passage via gunloops , and also on the ground floor is a well , in the basement of the round tower . 
 There is no direct communication between the ground floor and the Lord 's Hall above , which occupies the whole first floor . This is accessed via an enclosed and gated stair from the courtyard . The hall is vaulted , and has an unusual double fireplace . The floor tiles , timber panelling , and minstrels ' gallery are additions of the 1880s . It was originally thought that the connecting door to the Great Hall was also of this date , but is now accepted as being original . Side rooms on the hall level include a chamber in the round tower , with a hatch above the well , and a small chamber within the south wall which overlooks both hall and courtyard . A machicolation , or " murder hole " , below the hall 's north window , allows objects to be dropped onto attackers in the passage . 
 Above the hall is a second hall , forming part of the Duchess ' suite of rooms . An oratory in the south wall , overlooking the courtyard , contains a piscina and credence niche . The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to the walkway along the curtain wall . The timber ceiling of the Duchess ' hall , and the timber floors and roof above , are of the 1880s . The upper parts of the stonework are among the repairs dating from 1580 . 
 = = = Great Hall and kitchen tower = = = 
 West of the Lord 's tower is the Great Hall , 20 metres ( 66 ft ) by 8 metres ( 26 ft ) , and 12 metres ( 39 ft ) high to its timber roof , again a 19th @-@ century replacement . The hall has no fireplace , and was presumably heated by a central fire , and ventilated by means of a louvre like the one in the modern roof . No details of the original roof construction are known , however , and the restoration is conjectural . Large windows light the hall , and stairs lead down to the three cellars on ground level . 
 The hall is accessed from the courtyard via a stair up to a triangular lobby , which in turn links the hall and kitchens by means of two large serving hatches with elliptical arches , unusual for this period . The kitchen tower , virtually a tower house in its own right , is 17 metres ( 56 ft ) by 8 metres ( 26 ft ) . The vaulted kitchen is on the hall level , above a cellar . One of the best @-@ appointed castle kitchens in Scotland of its date , it has an oven and a 5 @.@ 5 @-@ metre ( 18 ft ) wide fireplace . A stair turret , added in 1581 and possibly replacing a timber stair , leads up from the lobby to two storeys of guest rooms . These include the " Royal Apartments " , a suite of two bedrooms plus an audience chamber , suitable for royal visitors . 
 = = = Courtyard and curtain wall = = = 
 Projecting stones on the south wall of the kitchen block , known as <unk> , and four pointed @-@ arched windows in the south curtain wall , suggest that further ranges of buildings were planned . The large , eastern @-@ most window , may have been intended for a chapel , and it is recorded that a chapel dedicated to the 8th @-@ century monk Saint Fillan was located at Doune Castle , but the lack of foundations suggest that there was no large building in this part of the castle . The foundations which do exist were excavated in September 2002 , revealing a structure which was interpreted as a kiln or oven against the south wall . The central well is around 18 metres ( 59 ft ) deep . 
 The curtain wall is 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) thick , and 12 metres ( 39 ft ) high . A walkway along the top of the wall is protected by parapets on both sides , and is carried over the pitched roofs of the hall and gatehouse by steep steps . Open , round turrets are located at each corner , with semicircular projections at the midpoint of each wall . A square turret with machicolations is located above the postern gate in the west wall . 
 = = = Interpretation of the layout = = = 
 The Lord 's tower is a secure , private set of rooms , probably intended for the sole use of the Lord and his family , and with its own lines of defence . The architectural historian W. Douglas Simpson interpreted this arrangement as being the product of the " bastard feudalism " of the 14th century . During this period , Lords were required to defend their castles by means of mercenaries , rather than the vassals of the earlier feudal system , and Simpson suggested that the Lord of Doune designed his tower to be defensible against his own , potentially rebellious , garrison . This interpretation is no longer widely accepted by historians , and the castle is instead seen as a development towards more integrated courtyard buildings , such as the royal palace of Linlithgow , which was constructed through the 15th and early 16th century . The layout of Doune has similarities with those of the contemporary castles at Tantallon and Bothwell , and appears , at various scales , in other buildings of the period . 
 = = In fiction and drama = = 
 Doune Castle has featured in several literary works , including the 17th @-@ century ballad , " The Bonny Earl of Murray " , which relates the murder of James Stewart , 2nd Earl of Moray , by the Earl of Huntly , in 1592 . In Sir Walter Scott 's first novel , Waverley ( 1814 ) , the protagonist Edward Waverley is brought to Doune Castle by the Jacobites . Scott 's romantic novel describes the " gloomy yet picturesque structure " , with its " half @-@ ruined turrets " . 
 The castle was used as a location in MGM 's 1952 historical film Ivanhoe which featured Robert Taylor and Elizabeth Taylor . The BBC adaptation of " Ivanhoe " in 1996 also featured Doune as a location . The castle was used as the set for Winterfell in the TV series Game of Thrones ( 2011 – present ) , an adaptation of the A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels by George R. R. Martin . The castle was used as a stand @-@ in for the fictional " Castle <unk> " in the TV adaptation of the Outlander series of novels . 
 = = = Monty Python and the Holy Grail = = = 
 The British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail — a parody of the legends of King Arthur by the Monty Python team — was filmed on location in Scotland in 1974 . The film 's producers had gained permission from the National Trust for Scotland to film scenes at several of their Scottish castles , as well as the permission of Lord Moray to film at Doune Castle . However , the National Trust later withdrew their permission , leaving the producers with little time to find new locations . Instead , they decided to use different parts of Doune Castle to depict the various fictional castles in the film , relying on tight framing of shots to maintain the illusion . 
 Scenes featuring Doune Castle include : 
 At the start of the film , King Arthur ( Graham Chapman ) and Patsy ( Terry Gilliam ) approach the east wall of Doune Castle and argue with soldiers of the garrison . 
 The song and dance routine " Knights of the Round Table " at " Camelot " was filmed in the Great Hall . 
 The servery and kitchen appear as " Castle Anthrax " , where Sir Galahad the Chaste ( Michael Palin ) is chased by seductive girls . 
 The wedding disrupted by Sir Lancelot ( John Cleese ) was filmed in the courtyard and Great Hall . 
 The Trojan Rabbit scene was filmed in the entryway and into the courtyard . 
 The only other castles used for filming were Castle Stalker in Argyll , also privately owned , which appears as " Castle <unk> " at the end of the film , and ( briefly ) Kidwelly Castle in Wales . The DVD version of Monty Python and the Holy Grail includes a documentary , In Search of the Holy Grail Filming Locations , in which Michael Palin and Terry Jones revisit Doune and other sites used for filming . Doune Castle has become a place of pilgrimage for fans of Monty Python and the film , and , since 2004 , an annual " Monty Python Day " has been held at the castle . 
 = Siege of Paris ( 845 ) = 
 The Siege of Paris and the Sack of Paris of 845 was the culmination of a Viking invasion of the kingdom of the West Franks . The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named " <unk> " , or Ragnar , who traditionally has been identified with the legendary saga character Ragnar Lodbrok . Ragnar 's fleet of 120 Viking ships , carrying thousands of men , entered the Seine in March and proceeded to sail up the river . The West Frankish king Charles the Bald assembled a smaller army in response , but as the Vikings defeated one division , comprising half of the army , the remaining forces retreated . The Vikings reached Paris at the end of the month , during Easter . After plundering and occupying the city , the Vikings finally withdrew after receiving a ransom payment of 7 @,@ 000 French livres ( 2 @,@ 570 kilograms or 5 @,@ 670 pounds ) of silver and gold from Charles the Bald . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Frankish Empire was first attacked by Viking raiders in 799 ( ten years after the earliest known Viking attack at Portland , Dorset in England ) , which eventually led Charlemagne to create a coastal defence system along the northern coast in 810 . The defence system successfully repulsed a Viking attack at the mouth of the Seine in 820 ( after Charlemagne 's death ) , but failed to hold against renewed attacks of Danish Vikings in Frisia and Dorestad in 834 . The attacks in 820 and 834 were unrelated and relatively minor , and more systematic raiding did not begin until the mid @-@ 830s , with the activity alternating between both sides of the English Channel . Viking raids were often part of struggles among Scandinavian nobility for power and status , and like other nations adjacent to the Franks , the Danes were well @-@ informed about the political situation in Francia ; in the 830s and early 840s they took advantage of the Frankish civil wars . Major raids took place in Antwerp and <unk> in 836 , in Rouen ( on the Seine ) in 841 , and in <unk> and Nantes in 842 . 
 = = Invasion and siege = = 
 In March 845 , a fleet of 120 Danish Viking ships containing more than 5 @,@ 000 men entered the Seine under the command of a Danish chieftain named " <unk> " , or Ragnar . This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok , but the historicity of the latter remains a disputed issue among historians . In or around 841 , Ragnar had been awarded land in <unk> , Frisia by Charles the Bald , but he eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the king . Ragnar 's Vikings raided Rouen on their way up the Seine in 845 , and in response to the invasion , determined not to let the royal Abbey of Saint @-@ Denis ( near Paris ) be destroyed , Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts , one for each side of the river . Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army , and took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine . This was done to honor the Norse god Odin , as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces . 
 The Vikings finally arrived in Paris on Easter Sunday , 29 March , entered the city and plundered it . During the siege , a plague broke out in their camp . The Norse had been exposed to the Christian religion , and after first praying to the Norse gods , they undertook a fast , acting on the advice of one of their Christian prisoners , and the plague subsided . The Franks could not assemble any effective defence against the invaders , and the Vikings withdrew only after being paid a ransom of 7 @,@ 000 livres ( French pounds ) of silver and gold by Charles the Bald , amounting to approximately 2 @,@ 570 kilograms ( 5 @,@ 670 lb ) . Considering Ragnar 's earlier loss of land by Charles , the substantial payment may also have been regarded as some form of compensation for Ragnar 's loss , and the invasion itself as an attack of revenge . In any case , this would be the first of a total of thirteen payments of so @-@ called Danegeld to Viking raiders by the Franks ( although the term itself is not expressly known to have been used at this particular point ) . While agreeing to withdraw from Paris , Ragnar pillaged several sites along the coast on the return voyage , including the Abbey of Saint Bertin . 
 Although Charles has been criticised severely for granting the large ransom payment to the Vikings , he had other more critical issues to deal with at the same time , including disputes with his brothers , regional revolts and disgruntled nobles , as well as pressure from abroad . Since he would have trouble trusting his own counts to assemble and lead troops to defeat Ragnar 's large force militarily , paying them off instead would buy Charles time , and possibly peace from further Viking raids — at least in the near future .

 The same year , a Viking fleet also sacked Hamburg , which had been elevated to an archbishopric by Pope Gregory IV in 831 on the initiative of Louis the Pious in order to oversee the Saxon territory and to support the introduction of Christianity to Scandinavia . In response , the East Frankish king Louis the German sent a diplomatic mission , headed by Count Cobbo ( one of two court counts ) , to the court of Horik , demanding that the Danish king submit to Frankish overlordship and pay reparations for the invasion . Horik eventually agreed to the terms and requested a peace treaty with Louis , while also promising to return the treasure and captives from the raid . Horik most likely wanted to secure the border with Saxony as he faced a conflict with King Olof of Sweden and domestic struggles . By the treaty , Louis demanded Horik 's obedience , which was further secured by Horik regularly sending embassies and gifts to Louis , and his suspension of support to Viking raiders . 
 Although many Vikings had died in the plague during the siege of Paris , Ragnar lived to return home to King Horik . According to a story originating from a member of Cobbo 's embassy , Ragnar , having attacked the Abbey of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ des @-@ Prés , then in the outskirts of medieval Paris , and which Cobbo later visited , attributed the plague to the power of Saint Germain of Paris . While Ragnar showed the gold and silver he had acquired to Horik and boasted about how easy he thought the conquest of Paris had been , he reportedly collapsed crying while relating that the only resistance he had met was by the long deceased saint . As several of Ragnar 's men died not long after , the king was so frightened that he ordered the execution of all the survivors , and the release of all his Christian captives . This event , in part , led Horik to receive Archbishop Ansgar , " Apostle of the North " , on friendly terms in his own kingdom . 
 Vikings would return again and again in the 860s and secure loot or ransom , but , in a turning point for the history of France , the city 's walls would hold against the Vikings ' greatest attacking force in the Siege of Paris ( 885 – 86 ) .

 Proactiv is aimed at customers with mild to moderate acne . According to a 2011 review , there have been few studies examining its efficacy . A 2007 study saw inflammatory lesions reduced by 39 percent in subjects using a combination of <unk> and benzoyl peroxide , compared with 34 percent in those using Proactiv containing only benzoyl peroxide . A physician suggested in Salon that its three @-@ step system might make it easier for teenagers to comply , but that the key to its success lay with its celebrity endorsements . 
 In 2011 Consumer Reports compared Proactiv ( 2 @.@ 5 percent benzoyl peroxide ) with two less expensive products , AcneFree ( 2 @.@ 5 percent benzoyl peroxide ) and OXY Maximum ( 10 percent benzoyl peroxide ) . At the time a two @-@ month supply of Proactiv cost around $ 40 in the US , AcneFree $ 20 and OXY Maximum $ 5 .

 Benzoyl peroxide can have a drying effect on the skin , can cause erythema ( redness ) and fine scaling , though these effects are usually mild , and can increase sensitivity to sunlight . One in 500 may experience allergic contact dermatitis . It is categorized as a pregnancy category C agent , " suggesting that its use in pregnancy may not be prudent , " according to a literature review in the Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology . If benzoyl peroxide comes into contact with clothing it is likely to bleach it . 
 The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) warned in 2014 that over @-@ the @-@ counter acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and / or salicylic acid , including Proactiv , can cause severe irritation , as well as rare but life @-@ threatening allergic reactions .

 = Homer the Heretic = 
 " Homer the Heretic " is the third episode of The Simpsons ' fourth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 8 , 1992 . In the episode , Homer decides to forgo going to church and has an excellent time staying home . His behavior quickly attracts the wrath of God , who visits him in a dream . The episode was written by George Meyer and directed by Jim Reardon . The chalkboard gag from this episode was a reference to the previous episode " A Streetcar Named Marge " , which had made controversial references to New Orleans . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On a freezing Sunday morning , Marge gathers the family to go to church . Homer refuses to go , much to her annoyance and dismay , after he sees the weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers . Staying behind , he sleeps in late , dances in his underwear ( à la Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business ) , makes his special waffle recipe , wins a radio trivia contest , watches an action @-@ packed football game , and finds a penny . Homer attributes his good fortune to skipping church and declares it the best day of his life . Meanwhile , Marge and the kids shiver their way through a rambling sermon , only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen shut . The congregation is forced to stay longer while Groundskeeper Willie <unk> the doors , and then Marge is unable to start her car because of the cold . 
 When she and the children finally get home , Marge is horrified to hear that Homer intends to never go to church again . She tries to persuade him otherwise , but to no avail . That night , Marge prays for her husband at their bedside . Homer tries to seduce her while she is doing so , but then falls asleep suddenly and has a dream in which God personally appears to him . God is furious with Homer for forsaking his church . Homer answers that " I 'm not a bad guy , I work hard , and I love my kids ... so why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I 'm going to hell ? " God agrees to let Homer worship in his own way . Homer starts following his own religion tailored to his personal tastes , including holidays he invents to get out of work . 
 Marge , Reverend Lovejoy and Ned Flanders attempt without success to bring Homer back to the congregation . One Sunday morning , while everybody else is at church , Homer falls asleep on the couch smoking a cigar , which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze . Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints . Apu , chief of Springfield 's volunteer fire department , rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown , Chief Wiggum , and Barney Gumble . Meanwhile , Flanders runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive . After the fire is out , Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance . Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was working through the hearts of Homer 's friends , despite their different faiths . Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there , albeit snoring loudly through the service . Appearing in his dreams again , God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion . He starts to tell Homer the meaning of life , but is cut off by the ending credits .

 This episode originated when Al Jean commented to Mike Reiss , " We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable , which was based on the eighth commandment , so maybe we could look to other commandments . So we thought , ' Honor the Sabbath ' would be a good one . So the ' Homer doesn 't go to church ' storyline was given to George Meyer . " Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed Catholic , Meyer would " bring the proper degree of rage " to the episode . Meyer had a lot of fun making the episode , thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church . One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God , he had to have fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream . Meyer did not want to show that God was literally appearing to Homer . This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that it was almost as if Homer had narcolepsy . This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team . Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team , " Homer the Heretic " read very well , particularly some of the visuals in the third act , such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders . 
 This was the first episode of The Simpsons where the animation was produced by Film Roman . Up until this point , Film Roman had mostly worked on Garfield and Friends and Bobby 's World episodes , and were not used to the speed with which The Simpsons episodes were produced . However , they quickly adjusted . Film Roman went on to do the animation for the rest of the series and eventually The Simpsons Movie . Previously , the animation was produced by Klasky Csupo . 
 The chalkboard gag for this episode , " I will not defame New Orleans " , was made as an apology to the citizens of New Orleans after it was musically insulted in the previous episode . 
 Along with " Mr. Plow " , a later episode of this season , this is one of the few television episodes that prominently featured snow outside of Christmas or Thanksgiving centric episodes . 
 In the scene in which Jimi Hendrix and Benjamin Franklin play a game of air hockey in Heaven , Hendrix was supposed to have a speaking line of his own to respond to Jefferson 's line . It was cut late during production because the voice actor for Hendrix did not sound enough like Hendrix . Jefferson 's line was kept because " nobody knows what he sounds like " , whereas Hendrix had a distinct voice . 
 The abrupt cutting off of God 's voice before he reveals the meaning of life was intended to be cut off by a voiceover promotion for whatever FOX program aired after The Simpsons . However , FOX did not pick up on this and so God 's voice was instead cut off by the show 's credits . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The brand label on Homer 's shower radio reads " No @-@ Soap , Radio ! " , so @-@ named for the punch line of a well @-@ known practical joke . The scene where Homer dances in his underwear to the Royal Teens song " Short Shorts " is almost identical to a scene in the 1983 Tom Cruise film , Risky Business . The burning floor collapsing beneath Flanders ' feet is a reference to the film <unk> . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original broadcast , " Homer the Heretic " finished 36th in ratings for the week of October 5 – 11 , 1992 , with a Nielsen rating of 12 @.@ 0 , equivalent to approximately 11 @.@ 2 million viewing households . It was the second highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following Married ... with Children . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , loved the episode . They described it as " A brilliant episode , underlining everything that The Simpsons is about . Homer hates church , Marge wants the kids to see Homer as an example , and everyone pulls together in the end . Good stuff , and if God really is like that , he 's a groovy kind of guy . " In 2012 , HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall cited the episode as his favorite of the show , writing that it " captures everything that was and is great about the series : social satire , extraordinary <unk> ( ' This Things I Believe ' ) , a good family story , and an innate sweetness in spite of Homer 's outsized antics . " In 2004 , ESPN.com released a list of the Top 100 Simpsons sport moments , ranking Benjamin Franklin and Jimi Hendrix 's air hockey game , a scene from the episode , at # 83 . The episode 's reference to Risky Business was named the 45th greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film 's Nathan Ditum . 
 The writers of the FOX program King of the Hill put " Homer the Heretic " among the five best episodes of The Simpsons , including " Brother from the Same Planet " , " Lisa 's Wedding " , " Lisa 's Substitute " , and " Behind the Laughter " . When asked to pick his favorite season out of The Simpsons seasons one through twenty , Paul Lane of the Niagara Gazette picked season four and highlighted " Brother from the Same Planet " and " Mr. Plow " which he called " excellent " , along with " the sweetly funny " " Lisa 's First Word " , and " Homer the Heretic " .

 The current site of the Willow Grove Park Mall was originally Willow Grove Park , a popular amusement park that existed from 1896 to 1975 . In 1978 , Federated Department Stores and The Rubin Organization announced plans to build a US $ 25 million mall on the site of the former amusement park . The plans for the mall were approved by Abington in 1979 , which included a downsizing to three anchor stores from four among concerns from residents about the size of the future mall . The Willow Grove Park Mall opened on August 11 , 1982 . The mall was designed with a Victorian theme honoring the former amusement park . The developers of the Willow Grove Park Mall were Federated Department Stores and The Rubin Organization and the architect was <unk> . When the mall opened , the original anchor stores were Bloomingdale 's , Abraham & Straus , and B. Altman and Company . Bloomingdale 's had relocated to the mall from a freestanding store in Jenkintown . When it opened , the Willow Grove Park Mall was intended to be an upscale mall . In 1984 , Federated Department Stores sold its share of the mall to the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States for US $ 43 million . In 1986 , B. Altman and Company closed its store , which reopened as Sears in 1987 . Sears relocated to the mall from a store in Abington . Around this time , the store selection at the mall broadened to also target the middle class . In 1988 Abraham & Straus closed and became Strawbridge & Clothier , which had relocated to the mall from a store in Jenkintown . 
 The mall was acquired by PREIT and the Pennsylvania State Employees ' Retirement System in 2000 for US $ 140 million from a group of pension fund clients managed by Lend Lease Real Estate Investments In 2001 , the mall underwent a major renovation which included the addition of Macy 's as an anchor , the construction of a 212 @,@ 000 square feet ( 19 @,@ 695 m2 ) parking garage with 800 parking spaces adjacent to Sears and the food court , and the addition of a carousel at the third floor entrance opposite the food court . The renovation of the mall cost US $ 25 million . PREIT assumed full ownership of the Willow Grove Park Mall in 2003 by acquiring the Pennsylvania State Employees ’ Retirement System 's 70 % share of ownership for US $ 122 @.@ 3 million . In 2005 , a mosaic wall with images from the former Willow Grove Park was installed in the mall . The mosaics were created by the Abington Art Center 's Youth Empowerment Program and the Abington Township Balanced and <unk> Justice Program from designs made by Carol <unk> @-@ Broad . In 2006 , Strawbridge ’ s closed due to the acquisition of its parent company May Department Stores by Federated Department Stores ; a portion of the former store on the upper floor became home to The Cheesecake Factory in September 2007 . The lower two floors were planned to open as Boscov 's ; however , it never opened due to the chain filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008 . 
 On July 28 , 2011 , it was announced that JCPenney would open a store on the lower two floors of the vacant Strawbridge 's .

The designation " IK Pegasi " follows the expanded form of the variable star nomenclature introduced by Friedrich W. Argelander . 
 Examination of the spectrographic features of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system . This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer , producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features . The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity of at least one of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components . 
 In 1927 , the Canadian astronomer William E. Harper used this technique to measure the period of this single @-@ line spectroscopic binary and determined it to be 21 @.@ 724 days . He also initially estimated the orbital eccentricity as 0 @.@ 027 . ( Later estimates gave an eccentricity of essentially zero , which is the value for a circular orbit . ) The velocity amplitude was measured as 41 @.@ 5 km / s , which is the maximum velocity of the primary component along the line of sight to the Solar System . 
 The distance to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts of this system ( against the more distant stellar background ) as the Earth orbits around the Sun . This shift was measured to high precision by the Hipparcos spacecraft , yielding a distance estimate of 150 light years ( with an accuracy of ± 5 light years ) . The same spacecraft also measured the proper motion of this system . This is the small angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky because of its motion through space . 
 The combination of the distance and proper motion of this system can be used to compute the transverse velocity of IK Pegasi as 16 @.@ 9 km / s . The third component , the heliocentric radial velocity , can be measured by the average red @-@ shift ( or blue @-@ shift ) of the stellar spectrum . The General Catalogue of Stellar Radial <unk> lists a radial velocity of <unk> km / s for this system . The combination of these two motions gives a space velocity of 20 @.@ 4 km / s relative to the Sun . 
 An attempt was made to photograph the individual components of this binary using the Hubble Space Telescope , but the stars proved too close to resolve . Recent measurements with the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer space telescope gave a more accurate orbital period of 21 @.@ <unk> ± 0 @.@ <unk> days . The inclination of this system 's orbital plane is believed to be nearly edge @-@ on ( 90 ° ) as seen from the Earth . If so it may be possible to observe an eclipse .

 The Hertzsprung @-@ Russell diagram ( HR diagram ) is a plot of luminosity versus a color index for a set of stars . IK Pegasi A is currently a main sequence star — a term that is used to describe a nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen @-@ fusing stars based on their position on the HR diagram . However , IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow , nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the instability strip . Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner , resulting in periodic pulsations in the star 's luminosity . 
 The pulsations result from a process called the κ @-@ mechanism . A part of the star 's outer atmosphere becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of certain elements . When these atoms lose an electron , the likelihood that they will absorb energy increases . This results in an increase in temperature that causes the atmosphere to expand . The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and loses energy , causing it to cool and shrink back down again . The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity . 
 Stars within the portion of the instability strip that crosses the main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables . These are named after the prototypical star for such variables : Delta Scuti . Delta Scuti variables typically range from spectral class A2 to F8 , and a stellar luminosity class of III ( <unk> ) to V ( main sequence stars ) . They are short @-@ period variables that have a regular pulsation rate between 0 @.@ 025 and 0 @.@ 25 days . Delta Scuti stars have an abundance of elements similar to the Sun 's ( see Population I stars ) and between 1 @.@ 5 and 2 @.@ 5 M ☉ . The pulsation rate of IK Pegasi A has been measured at 22 @.@ 9 cycles per day , or once every 0 @.@ 044 days . 
 Astronomers define the metallicity of a star as the abundance of chemical elements that have a higher atomic number than helium . This is measured by a spectroscopic analysis of the atmosphere , followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models . In the case of IK Pegasus A , the estimated metal abundance is [ M / H ] = + 0 @.@ 07 ± 0 @.@ 20 . This notation gives the logarithm of the ratio of metal elements ( M ) to hydrogen ( H ) , minus the logarithm of the Sun 's metal ratio . ( Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun , this value will be zero . ) A logarithmic value of 0 @.@ 07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1 @.@ 17 , so the star is about 17 % richer in metallic elements than the Sun . However the margin of error for this result is relatively large . 
 The spectrum of A @-@ class stars such as IK Pegasi A show strong Balmer lines of hydrogen along with absorption lines of ionized metals , including the K line of ionized calcium ( Ca II ) at a wavelength of 393 @.@ 3 nm . The spectrum of IK Pegasi A is classified as marginal Am ( or " Am : " ) , which means it displays the characteristics of a spectral class A but is marginally metallic @-@ lined . That is , this star 's atmosphere displays slightly ( but anomalously ) higher than normal absorption line strengths for metallic isotopes . Stars of spectral type Am are often members of close binaries with a companion of about the same mass , as is the case for IK Pegasi . 
 Spectral class @-@ A stars are hotter and more massive than the Sun . But , in consequence , their life span on the main sequence is correspondingly shorter . For a star with a mass similar to IK Pegasi A ( 1 @.@ 65 M ☉ ) , the expected lifetime on the main sequence is 2 – 3 × 109 years , which is about half the current age of the Sun . 
 In terms of mass , the relatively young Altair is the nearest star to the Sun that is a stellar analogue of component A — it has an estimated 1 @.@ 7 M ☉ . The binary system as a whole has some similarities to the nearby system of Sirius , which has a class @-@ A primary and a white dwarf companion . However , Sirius A is more massive than IK Pegasi A and the orbit of its companion is much larger , with a semimajor axis of 20 AU . 
 = = IK Pegasi B = = 
 The companion star is a dense white dwarf star . This category of stellar object has reached the end of its evolutionary life span and is no longer generating energy through nuclear fusion . Instead , under normal circumstances , a white dwarf will steadily radiate away its excess energy , mainly stored heat , growing cooler and dimmer over the course of many billions of years . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 Nearly all small and intermediate @-@ mass stars ( below about 9 M ☉ ) will end up as white dwarfs once they have exhausted their supply of thermonuclear fuel . Such stars spend most of their energy @-@ producing life span as a main @-@ sequence star . The time that a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on its mass , with the lifespan decreasing with increasing mass . Thus , for IK Pegasi B to have become a white dwarf before component A , it must once have been more massive than component A. In fact , the progenitor of IK Pegasi B is thought to have had a mass between 5 and 8 M ☉ . 
 As the hydrogen fuel at the core of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed , it evolved into a red giant . The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core . To compensate for the temperature increase , the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star . When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a horizontal branch star . That is , it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H @-@ R diagram . The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen . When helium was exhausted in the core a helium @-@ burning shell formed in addition to the hydrogen @-@ burning one and the star moved to what astronomers term the asymptotic giant branch , or AGB . ( This is a track leading to the upper @-@ right corner of the H @-@ R diagram . ) If the star had sufficient mass , in time carbon fusion could begin in the core , producing oxygen , neon and magnesium . 
 The outer envelope of a red giant or AGB star can expand to several hundred times the radius of the Sun , occupying a radius of about 5 × 108 km ( 3 AU ) in the case of the pulsating AGB star Mira . This is well beyond the current average separation between the two stars in IK Pegasi , so during this time period the two stars shared a common envelope . As a result , the outer atmosphere of IK Pegasi A may have received an isotope enhancement . 
 Some time after an inert oxygen @-@ carbon ( or oxygen @-@ magnesium @-@ neon ) core formed , thermonuclear fusion began to occur along two shells concentric with the core region ; hydrogen was burned along the outermost shell , while helium fusion took place around the inert core . However , this double @-@ shell phase is unstable , so it produced thermal pulses that caused large @-@ scale mass ejections from the star 's outer envelope . This ejected material formed an immense cloud of material called a planetary nebula . All but a small fraction of the hydrogen envelope was driven away from the star , leaving behind a white dwarf remnant composed primarily of the inert core . 
 = = = Composition and structure = = = 
 The interior of IK Pegasi B may be composed wholly of carbon and oxygen ; alternatively , if its progenitor underwent carbon burning , it may have a core of oxygen and neon , surrounded by a mantle enriched with carbon and oxygen . In either case , the exterior of IK Pegasi B is covered by an atmosphere of almost pure hydrogen , which gives this star its stellar classification of DA . Due to higher atomic mass , any helium in the envelope will have sunk beneath the hydrogen layer . The entire mass of the star is supported by electron degeneracy pressure — a quantum mechanical effect that limits the amount of matter that can be squeezed into a given volume . 
 At an estimated 1 @.@ 15 M ☉ , IK Pegasi B is considered to be a high @-@ mass white dwarf . Although its radius has not been observed directly , it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs , giving a value of about 0 @.@ 60 % of the Sun 's radius . ( A different source gives a value of 0 @.@ 72 % , so there remains some uncertainty in this result . ) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth , giving an indication of this object 's extreme density . 
 The massive , compact nature of a white dwarf produces a strong surface gravity . Astronomers denote this value by the decimal logarithm of the gravitational force in cgs units , or log g . For IK Pegasi B , log g is 8 @.@ 95 . By comparison , log g for the Earth is 2 @.@ 99 . Thus the surface gravity on IK Pegasi is over 900 @,@ 000 times the gravitational force on the Earth . 
 The effective surface temperature of IK Pegasi B is estimated to be about 35 @,@ 500 ± 1 @,@ 500 K , making it a strong source of ultraviolet radiation . Under normal conditions this white dwarf would continue to cool for more than a billion years , while its radius would remain essentially unchanged . 
 = = Future evolution = = 
 In a 1993 paper , David <unk> , Barry J. Kellett and David J. <unk> identified this system as a candidate to evolve into a Type Ia supernova or a cataclysmic variable . At a distance of 150 light years , this makes it the nearest known candidate supernova progenitor to the Earth . However , in the time it will take for the system to evolve to a state where a supernova could occur , it will have moved a considerable distance from Earth but may yet pose a threat . 
 At some point in the future , IK Pegasi A will consume the hydrogen fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant . The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions , extending up to a hundred times its previous radius ( or larger ) . Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion , a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf . This gas , composed primarily of hydrogen and helium , will then accrete onto the surface of the companion . This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink . 
 On the surface of the white dwarf , the accreted gas will become compressed and heated . At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur , producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface . This would result in a ( recurrent ) nova explosion — a cataclysmic variable star — and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months . An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi , a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion . RS Ophiuchi has flared into a ( recurrent ) nova on at least six occasions , each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion . 
 It is possible that IK Pegasi B will follow a similar pattern . In order to accumulate mass , however , only a portion of the accreted gas can be ejected , so that with each cycle the white dwarf would steadily increase in mass . Thus , even should it behave as a recurring nova , IK Pegasus B could continue to accumulate a growing envelope . 
 An alternate model that allows the white dwarf to steadily accumulate mass without erupting as a nova is called the close @-@ binary supersoft x @-@ ray source ( <unk> ) . In this scenario , the mass transfer rate to the close white dwarf binary is such that a steady fusion burn can be maintained on the surface as the arriving hydrogen is consumed in thermonuclear fusion to produce helium . This category of super @-@ soft sources consist of high @-@ mass white dwarfs with very high surface temperatures ( 0 @.@ 5 × 106 to 1 × 106 K ) . 
 Should the white dwarf 's mass approach the Chandrasekhar limit of <unk> ☉ it will no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and it will undergo a collapse . For a core primarily composed of oxygen , neon and magnesium , the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star . In this case , only a fraction of star 's mass will be ejected as a result . If the core is instead made of carbon @-@ oxygen , however , increasing pressure and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to attainment of the Chandrasekhar limit . The dramatic result is a runaway nuclear fusion reaction that consumes a substantial fraction of the star within a short time . This will be sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic , Type Ia supernova explosion . 
 Such a supernova event may pose some threat to life on the Earth . It is thought that the primary star , IK Pegasi A , is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future . As shown previously , the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20 @.@ 4 km / s . This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14 @,@ 700 years . After 5 million years , for example , this star will be separated from the Sun by more than 500 light years . A Type Ia supernova within a thousand parsecs ( 3300 light @-@ years ) is thought to be able to affect the Earth , but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs ( around thirty light @-@ years ) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere . 
 Following a supernova explosion , the remnant of the donor star ( IK Pegasus A ) would continue with the final velocity it possessed when it was a member of a close orbiting binary system . The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100 – 200 km / s , which would place it among the high @-@ velocity members of the galaxy . The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion , and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris . From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star . The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium . 
 = Ideology of the SS = 
 The ideology espoused by the Schutzstaffel ( " Protection Squadron " ; SS ) , a paramilitary force and instrument of terror of the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany , emphasized a racist vision of " racial purity " , antisemitism , and loyalty to Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany . 
 SS men were indoctrinated with the belief they were members of a " master race " . The ideology of the SS was , even more so than in Nazism in general , built on the belief in a superior " Aryan race . " This led to the SS playing the main role in political violence and crimes against humanity , including the Holocaust and " mercy killing " of those with congenital illnesses . After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II , the SS and Nazi Party were found to be criminal organizations at the Nuremberg Trials . 
 = = Ideological foundations = = 
 The ideology of the SS was built upon and mainly congruent with Nazi ideology . At its center laid the belief in a superior " Nordic race " and the " inferiority " of other races . The SS also served as the central institution for the extension of Nazi ideology and its realisation . Representing the ideological opponents of the regime in one form or fashion , historian George C. Browder identified the Nazi state 's list of enemies as follows : enemy states , miscegenation , the Jews , Catholicism , freemasonry , Communism , the Republic ( hostility directed at the liberal republican constitution and form of government ) , homosexuality , moral decay , capitalists , and the " Old Guard " ( hate and fear of traditionally powerful influences and institutions of the old society as unjust , retarding influences in German society ) . All of these " enemies " became the focus of the main power instrument of Nazi totalitarianism , the SS , as they sought to direct and influence ideology and ethics within the Reich . 
 Himmler intended for the SS to be a hierarchical system of " ideological fighters " from the organization 's inception . The SS proved to be that and more , becoming the instrument most responsible for the actualization of Nazi beliefs . SS ideology comprised perhaps the single most significant philosophical dimension of Nazism , employing in the process , ontological , anthropological , and ethical elements to their methods under the guise of science , shaping the Nazi state 's doctrine and crystallizing ideals ( no matter how callous ) into dogmatic truths . SS principles and thinking provided pseudo @-@ scientific rationales for the devaluation of humanity , and ideological justification for Nazi violence and genocide . 
 The SS placed an intense emphasis in their indoctrination upon elitism and portrayed themselves as part of an " elite " order which " explicitly modelled [ themselves ] on an historical version of religious orders , such as the Teutonic Knights or the Jesuits , whose dedication to a higher idea was admired in these otherwise anti @-@ clerical circles " . Even though Himmler and the other SS leaders repeatedly demanded sobriety within their ranks , alcoholism was a frequent problem with SS @-@ men . 700 members were excluded from the SS for " listlessness and laziness " in 1937 / 38 alone . A further 12 @,@ 000 left the SS in the same period for unknown reasons , calling into question the institution 's claims of " loyalty for life " . 
 = = Indoctrination = = 
 The strict training program was focused on the fundamental ideological principles of the Nazi Party , namely the belief in a " superior Nordic race " , loyalty and absolute obedience to Adolf Hitler , and hatred for those who were considered " inferior people " , with great emphasis on antisemitism . Students studied the most anti @-@ Semitic passages of Mein Kampf ( " My Struggle " ) , Hitler 's autobiographical manifesto , and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , a fraudulent anti @-@ Semitic document first published in Russia in 1903 , which purported to describe a Jewish plan for global domination . The SS educational leaders were also responsible for general anti @-@ religious training , which was part of the Nazi attempt at " reversing the bourgeois @-@ Christian system of values . " Educational training was clearly linked with " racial selection , at the end of which stood the ' weeding out ' and selective breeding of human beings " ; this facet coincided the impending Nazi effort to Germanize Europe and formed part of the policy for the racial @-@ imperialist conquest in the East . 
 Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 , membership in the SS grew considerably , prompting an increase in ideological instruction . The SS @-@ <unk> took over the task of heading the educational matters of the SS , led by Karl Motz . The SS published two additional magazines for ideological propaganda : the monthly FM @-@ Zeitschrift , funded by 350 @,@ 000 non @-@ member financial patrons of the SS , and the weekly Das Schwarze Korps , the second biggest weekly paper in Nazi Germany . 
 Beginning in 1938 , the SS intensified the ideological indoctrination of the Hitler @-@ Jugend <unk> ( " Hitler Youth Land Service " ) . It set out the ideal of the German " <unk> " ( " Soldier Peasant " ) . Special high schools were created under SS control to form a Nazi agrarian " elite " that was trained according to the principle of " blood and soil " . While SS leader Heinrich Himmler remained concerned about the racial elitism of his SS , it was Reinhard Heydrich , Himmler 's deputy and protégé , who focused his attention on their political indoctrination through the creation of " racial detectives " who would become Hitler 's " ideological Shock Troops " . This being done through the Sicherheitsdienst ( Security Service ; SD ) which was tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi leadership and the neutralization of any opposition . The SD used its organization of agents and informants , all part of the development of an extensive SS state and a totalitarian regime without parallel . 
 The SS practiced a wide variety of disciplinary measures , with punishments composed of reprimands , prohibition to wear the uniform , detention , demotion , suspension , and expulsion . Contrary to claims made by many SS @-@ members after 1945 , no one had to fear being incarcerated in a concentration camp for <unk> . Starting in June 1933 , the SS had its own courts to deal with crimes and misdemeanors within its ranks . On 17 October 1939 , Himmler succeeded in having the SS put under its own special jurisdiction . Once this change occurred , SS @-@ members could no longer be tried in civil courts . 
 = = Racial policies = = 
 Consistent with the eugenic and racial policies of the Third Reich , Himmler advocated racial elitism for his SS members . Throughout the existence of the SS , its members were regularly encouraged to procreate to maintain and increase the " Aryan @-@ Nordic bloodline ; " the SS members , along with their wives and children , were to become an exclusive racial community ( <unk> ) within the Nazi state . Along these lines , Himmler stated on 8 November 1937 at a Gruppenführer meeting in Munich in the officers ' quarters : 
 The SS is a National Socialist order of soldiers of Nordic race and a community of their clans bound together by oath ... what we want for Germany is a ruling class destined to last for centuries and the product of repeated selection , a new aristocracy continuously renewed from the best of the sons and daughters of our nation , a nobility that never ages , stretching back into distant epochs in its traditions , where these are valuable , and representing eternal youth for our nation . 
 Hitler subscribed to these views and once remarked that the " elite " of the future Nazi state would stem from the SS since " only the SS practices racial selection . " Wives of SS members were scrutinized accordingly for their " racial fitness " , and marriages had to be approved through official channels as part of the SS ideological mandate . According to their ideology , SS men were believed to be the bearers of the very best of the so @-@ called Nordic blood , and it was their ideological tenets and scholarly justifications that shaped numerous Nazi actions and policies , merging racial determinism , Nordicism , and antisemitism . 
 An SS Doctors ' Leader School was established in the small village of Alt @-@ <unk> which encouraged the practice of " racial hygiene " and focused on the future of " German genetic streams " ( deutsche <unk> ) . Medical journal articles written by SS intellectuals stressed the importance of genetic heritage , arguing that " biology and genetics are the roots from which the National Socialist worldview has derived its knowledge , and from which it continues to derive new strength . " In order to promote its role as a preserver of the Germanic heritage , the SS founded the Ahnenerbe institute in 1935 . It conducted anthropological , historic , and <unk> studies to provide scientific backing to Himmler 's ideological ideas . In the years until 1939 , the institute worked in a hybrid state between important findings such as the Viking village Hedeby and erratic studies into the <unk> and medieval witch @-@ hunts , which Himmler thought to have been murders committed by the Roman Catholic church against Germanic women of " good blood " . After World War II started , the Ahnenerbe was heavily involved in experiments conducted in concentration camps , costing the lives of thousands of inmates . 
 Not only was contact with racial " others " a concern , but attrition through war was an additional factor . Fear of losing a large percentage of Germanic racial stock once the Second World War began drove SS ideology , as victory in the field could not prevail without a corresponding biological legacy of children to carry on the mission . Himmler stressed that SS men were obliged to procreate to preserve Germany 's genetic legacy so the " master race " could secure and sustain the " Thousand Year Reich " of the future . 
 However , SS men did not fulfill the expectations : at the end of 1938 , 57 % of the members were still unmarried , only 26 % had fathered a child and just 8 % had reached Himmler 's desired goal of at least four children . Also in 1935 , the SS initiated Lebensborn , an association created to provide unmarried , pregnant women of " good blood " with opportunities to deliver their children , who were then given up for adoption into families deemed racially suited . The Lebensborn facilities were situated in remote locations , guaranteeing the anonymity of the women . Lebensborn was only moderately successful , producing only an estimated 8 @,@ 000 - 11 @,@ 000 births in the ten years of its existence . 
 After the beginning of World War II , the SS recruited large numbers of non @-@ Germans from the " inferior races " espoused by the Nazi and SS ideology . To justify this contradiction , Himmler began to stress a shared European identity more strongly in the early 1940s , promising that " all those who are of good blood will be given the possibility to grow into the German Volk " . According to historian Mark P. Gingerich , of the one million Waffen @-@ SS men who served during the war , over half were not even German citizens . 
 = = Attitude toward religion = = 
 According to Himmler biographer Peter Longerich , Himmler saw a main task of the SS to be that of " acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a Germanic way of living " as part of preparations for the coming conflict between " humans and subhumans " . Longerich wrote that , while the Nazi movement as a whole launched itself against Jews and Communists , " by linking de @-@ Christianisation with re @-@ Germanization , Himmler had provided the SS with a goal and purpose all of its own . " Himmler was vehemently opposed to Christian sexual morality and the " principle of Christian mercy " , both of which he saw as a dangerous obstacle to his planned battle with " subhumans " . In 1937 , he said that the movement was an era of the " ultimate conflict with Christianity " and that " It is part of the mission of the SS to give the German people in the next half century the non @-@ Christian ideological foundations on which to lead and shape their lives . " 
 The SS developed an anti @-@ clerical agenda : no chaplains were allowed in its units ( although they were allowed in the regular army ) . The Sicherheitsdienst ( Security Service ; SD ) department of the SS and Gestapo under Reinhard Heydrich were used to identify and assist other Nazi organizations in suppressing Catholic influence in the press , youth clubs , schools , publications , " pilgrimages and processions " . 
 Himmler used the Jesuits as the model for the SS , since he found they had the core elements of absolute obedience and the cult of the organisation . Hitler is said to have called Himmler " my Ignatius of Loyola " . As an order , the SS needed a coherent doctrine that would set it apart . Himmler attempted to construct such an ideology , and deduced a " pseudo @-@ Germanic tradition " from history . Himmler dismissed the image of Christ as a Jew and rejected Christianity 's basic doctrine and its institutions . In a 1936 memorandum , he set forth a list of approved holidays based on pagan and political precedents meant to wean SS members from their reliance on Christian festivities . Starting in 1934 , the SS hosted " solstice ceremonies " ( <unk> ) to increase team spirit within their ranks . In an attempt to replace Christianity within the SS with the new doctrine , SS @-@ men were able to choose special <unk> , substituting common Christian ceremonies such as baptisms , weddings and burials . Since the ceremonies were held in small private circles , it is unknown how many SS @-@ members opted for these kind of celebrations . 
 = = = Rejection of Christian precepts = = = 
 Many of the concepts promoted with the SS violated accepted Christian doctrine , but neither Himmler nor his deputy Heydrich expected the Christian church to support their stance on abortion , contraception or sterilization of the unfit – let alone their shared belief in polygamy for the sake of racial propagation . This did not however represent disbelief in a higher power from either man nor did it deter them on their ideological quest . In fact , atheism was banned within the SS as Himmler believed it to be a form of egotism that placed the individual at the center of the universe , and thus constituted a rejection of the SS principle of valuing the collective over the individual . All SS men were required to list themselves as Protestant , Catholic or <unk> ( " Believer in God " ) . Himmler preferred the neo @-@ pagan " expression of spirituality " . Still , by 1938 " only 21 @.@ 9 percent of SS members described themselves as <unk> , whereas 54 percent remained Protestant and just under 24 percent Catholic . " Belief in God among the SS did not constitute adherence to traditional Christian doctrine nor were its members consummate theologians , as the SS outright banned certain Christian organizations like the International Bible Research Association , a group whose pacifism the SS rejected . Dissenting religious organizations like the Jehovah 's Witnesses were severely persecuted by the SS for their pacifism , failure to participate in elections , non @-@ observance of the Hitler salute , not displaying the Nazi flag , and for their non @-@ participation in Nazi organizations ; many were sent to concentration camps where they perished . Heydrich once quipped that any and all opposition to Nazism originated from either " Jews or politicized clergy . " 
 = = = Neo @-@ pagan doctrine = = = 
 In order to promote his religious ideas and link them to an alleged Germanic tradition , Himmler began to establish cult sites . The most important of these was the Wewelsburg , close to Paderborn . The SS leased the castle in 1934 , after Himmler had first seen it in November 1933 while campaigning with Hitler . Originally planned as a school for high ranking SS @-@ men , the castle soon became the object of far reaching construction plans , with an aim at establishing the Wewelsburg as the " ideological center " of the SS and its pseudo @-@ Germanic doctrine . In accordance with the other efforts of Himmler to replace Christian rituals and establish the SS as the Nazi " elite " , the Wewelsburg received special rooms , such as crypts , a General 's hall with a sun wheel embedded in the floor and a crest hall . As a second location , Himmler ordered for a memorial of 4 @,@ 500 giant foundlings to be placed near Verden an der Aller , the scene of the infamous Massacre of Verden in 782 , calling the place <unk> . At the sight of the <unk> , which at the time was believed to be close to the scene of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest , Himmler ordered excavations to take place there in order to prove that Christian monks had destroyed a Germanic cult site known as <unk> during the Middle Ages . As a last site of Himmler 's cult , the SS took over and remodelled Quedlinburg Abbey , burial place of Henry the Fowler , who was celebrated by Himmler for his refusal to be anointed by a Roman bishop . 
 Himmler also instituted these rites and rituals to try and foster a greater sense of belonging to a fraternal order . For example , each year on the anniversary of the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch , the SS men duty @-@ bound for the military units were sworn in at 10 : 00 pm in front of Hitler . There by torchlight they swore " obedience unto death " . 
 However , these attempts to establish a new , neo @-@ pagan religion were not successful . Historian Heinz <unk> observes that the " neo @-@ pagan customs " Himmler introduced into the SS " remained primarily a paper exercise " . Most of Himmler 's attempts to link " old Teutonic " traditions into the spiritual life of the SS and society at large were criticised by the Church as a form of " new heathenism . " Although the SS never endorsed Christian beliefs , the traditional rituals and practices of the Christian faith were generally tolerated and respected . According to Bastian Hein , two reasons contributed to Himmler 's Ersatz religion never catching on : On the one hand , Himmler himself was in a constant search for religious certainty , leaving his doctrine vague and unclear . On the other hand , Hitler personally intervened after the churches lamented the " neo @-@ heathenish " tendencies within the SS , telling Himmler and Alfred Rosenberg to " cut out the cultic nonsense " . 
 = = Culture of violence = = 
 The SS was built on a culture of violence , which was exhibited in extreme form by the mass murder of civilians and prisoners on the Eastern Front . Historian Hans Buchheim wrote that the mentality and ideal values of the SS men were to be " hard , " with no emotions such as love or kindness ; hatred for the " inferior " and contempt for anyone who was not in the SS ; unthinking obedience ; " camaraderie " with fellow members of the SS ; and an intense militarism that saw the SS as part of an " elite order " fighting for a better Germany . The principal " enemy " of the SS , represented as a force of uncompromising , utter evil and depravity , was " world Jewry " . Members of the SS were encouraged to fight against the " Jewish Bolshevik sub @-@ humans " . 
 The SS value of " fighting for fighting 's sake " could be traced back to the values of the front @-@ line German soldiers in World War I and the post @-@ war Freikorps , and in turn led SS members to see violence as the highest possible value , and conventional morality as a hindrance to achieving victory . The SS mentality fostered violence and " hardness " . The ideal SS man was supposed to be in a state of permanent readiness . As historian Hans Buchheim quips , " the SS man had to be forever on duty . " For members of the SS their mentality was such that for them , nothing was impossible no matter how arduous or cruel , to include the " murder of millions " . SS men who attempted to live by that principle of violence had an unusually high suicide rate . The " soldierly " values of the SS were specific to the German post @-@ World War I concept of the " political soldier " who was indoctrinated to be a " fighter " who would devote his life to struggling for the nation . 
 Although not an SS document , the 1930 book Krieg und Krieger ( " War and Warriors " ) , edited by Ernst Jünger , with contributions by Friedrich Georg Jünger , Friedrich <unk> , Werner Best and Ernst von Salomon , served as an excellent introduction to the intellectual traditions from which the SS ideal arose . The essays in Krieg und Krieger called for a revolutionary reorganization of German society , which was to be led by " heroic " leaders who would create a " new moral code " based upon the idea that life was a never @-@ ending , Social Darwinian " struggle " that could only be settled with violence . The book claimed that Germany had only been defeated in the First World War because the country had been insufficiently " spiritually mobilized " , and what was required to win the next war was the proper sort of " heroic " leaders , unhindered by conventional morality , who would do what was necessary to win . The values of the " heroic realism " literature gloried the principle and practice of fighting to the death regardless of the military situation . 
 Out of the intellectual heritage of the " heroic realism " literature came a rejection of the traditional values of Christianity and the enlightenment ( principles which were considered too sentimental ) ; what emerged in its place was a cold indifference to the value of human life . Marriage of the image of the " fighter " from " heroic realism " literature and the practical need of the SS to serve as political cadres for the National Socialist state , led to the elevation of the concept of " duty " as the highest obligation of the SS man . The SS ethos called for " achievement for achievement 's sake " , where achievement ranked as the highest measurement of success . As such , winning at all costs regardless the sacrifice became a supreme SS virtue . The SS principle of loyalty above all , as reflected in the official slogan " My honour is loyalty " , was severed from traditional moral considerations and instead focused entirely upon Hitler . The idealized and distorted version of German history which was espoused was intended to instill pride in SS men . Himmler admonished the SS against pity , neighborly love , and humility , instead celebrating hardness and self @-@ discipline . <unk> the SS to perceive racial " others " and state enemies as undeserving of their pity , helped create an environment and a mental framework where the men saw acts of wanton violence against those same enemies , not as a crime , but part of their patriotic obligation to the Nazi state . 
 = = Ideology of genocide = = 
 As historian Claudia <unk> points out , " the cerebral racism of the SS provided the mental armor for mass murderers . " When Himmler visited Minsk and witnessed a mass killing of 100 people , he made a speech to the executioners emphasizing the need to put orders over conscience , saying that " soldiers ... had to carry out every order unconditionally " . According to historian George Stein , unquestioning obedience and " submission to authority " on the part of the SS represented one of the ideological " foundation stones " to combat the party 's enemies . As the Waffen @-@ SS took part in the invasions of eastern European countries and the Soviet Union , the men wrote of their " great service in saving western civilization from being overrun by Asiatic Communism . " 
 One Waffen @-@ SS recruiting pamphlet told potential members that answering the call meant being " especially bound to the National Socialist ideology , " a doctrine which implied both an ideological battle and a racial struggle against subhumans ( Untermenschen ) accompanied by an unprecedented brutalization of warfare . Participation in the " repellant task " of becoming psychologically involved in the killings was a rite of initiation of sorts and showed just how " internalized " the Nazi beliefs were for members of the SS . It was also part of the rhetoric of legitimation that gave meaning to their acts of extermination and habituated the SS to an ideology of genocide . 
 Special SS death squads known as Einsatzgruppen were used for large @-@ scale extermination and genocide of Jews , gypsies , Asians , and communists . On 17 June 1941 , Heydrich briefed the leaders of the Einsatzgruppen and their subordinate units on the general policy of killing Jews in the Soviet lands . SD member Walter Blume later testified that Heydrich called Eastern Jews the " reservoir of intellectuals for Bolshevism , " and said that the " state leadership held the view that [ they ] must be destroyed . " 
 The SS Einsatzgruppen were supplemented by the specially created Order Police ( drawn from Germany and / or the local populations ) who were indoctrinated by the SS to also take part in mass killings . One Order Police participant named Kurt Möbius testified during a postwar trial , that he believed the SS propaganda about the Jews being " criminals and sub @-@ humans " who had caused " Germany 's decline after the First World War . " He went on to state that evading " the order to participate in the extermination of the Jews " never entered his mind . One SS officer , Karl Kretschmer , " saw himself as a representative of a cultured people fighting a primitive , barbaric enemy , " and wrote to his family of the need to desensitize himself from the mass killings . Burleigh and <unk> write : " Members of the SS administered , tortured , and murdered people with a cold , steely precision , and without moral scruples . " 
 The SS and its accompanying principles represented the realization of Nazi ideology and played a crucial role in the extermination of European Jews that followed the Nazis ' rise to power . As historian Gerald Reitlinger states , while the idealism and machinery of the SS as a state within a state will all be forgotten , their acts of " ... racial <unk> , the concentration camps , the interrogation cells of the Gestapo , the medical experiments of the living , the mass reprisals , the manhunts for slave labor and the racial exterminations will be remembered forever . " 
 Historian Hans Buchheim argues there was no coercion to murder Jews and others , and all who committed such actions did so out of free will . He wrote that chances to avoid executing criminal orders " were both more numerous and more real than those concerned are generally prepared to admit " . Buchheim commented that until the middle of 1942 , the SS had been a strictly volunteer organization , and that anyone who joined the SS after the Nazis had taken over the German government either knew or came to know that he was joining an organization that would be involved in atrocities of one sort or another . There is no known record of an SS officer refusing to commit an atrocity ; they willingly did so , and then cherished the awards they received for doing it . 
 Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or firing squad by SS Einsatzgruppen units , but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of the scale carried out by the Nazi state . In August 1941 , SS leader Himmler attended the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk . <unk> and shaken by the experience , he was concerned about the impact such actions would have on the mental health of his SS men . He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found . On his orders , by spring 1942 the camp at Auschwitz had been greatly expanded , including the addition of gas chambers , where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B. By the end of the war , at least eleven million people , including 5 @.@ 5 to 6 million Jews and between 200 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 Romani people had been killed by the Nazi state with assistance by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries . Acting on Hitler 's orders , Himmler was a main architect of the Holocaust and the SS was the main branch of the Nazi Party that implemented it . 
 = = Post @-@ war = = 
 On 23 May 1945 , Himmler , who had been responsible for so much of the SS doctrine and that of the Nazi state , committed suicide after he was captured by the Allies . Other senior members of the SS fled . Chief of the Reich Main Security Office , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Ernst Kaltenbrunner , who was the ranking member of the SS upon Himmler 's suicide , was captured in the Bavarian Alps and tried at the Nuremberg Tribunal along with other leading Nazis like Hermann Göring , Joachim von Ribbentrop , Alfred Rosenberg , Hans Frank , among others . Kaltenbrunner was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed on 16 October 1946 . 
 Other SS intellectuals and physicians were also brought to trial and convicted , including the SS Ahnenerbe doctors who killed the enfeebled and / or disabled persons deemed " unworthy to live " or who performed medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners . During questioning after the war , many of the SS doctors from the concentration camps avowed that the allegiance they had sworn to Hitler superseded any of the rituals performed at medical school to say nothing of the Hippocratic Oath they had otherwise ignored . SS members absolved themselves through the pseudo @-@ scientific justification that they were merely acting as instruments ( men of action ) on behalf of the German people in pursuit of " racial hygiene . " Similar strategies of negation and dismissal of responsibility were displayed by SS men during their post @-@ war trials , either by way of legitimizing their actions as a result of unconditional obedience to their superiors ( intimating responsibility onto them ) or through the use of innocuous sounding bureaucratic language . 
 Given the impact that the Nazi ideology had on the European continent in causing a catastrophic war and unparalleled crimes , the Allied powers determined Germany shall be demilitarized and the country divided into four occupation zones . They also began the process of denazification ( <unk> ) . This was essentially an effort to " purge " the German people of the Nazi ideology that had pushed them to war and resulted in the Holocaust . <unk> , many members of the SS , including some from the upper echelons , faced little more than a stint in a POW camp , a short denazification hearing and were treated with " remarkable leniency " .

 = Indestructible ( Disturbed album ) = 
 Indestructible is the fourth studio album by the American heavy metal band Disturbed . A self @-@ produced effort , Indestructible is the first Disturbed album that did not feature Johnny K , the producer of Disturbed 's previous three albums , The Sickness , Believe , and Ten Thousand Fists . Indestructible was recorded at <unk> Studios in Chicago , Illinois . The album features two songs , " Perfect Insanity " and " Divide " , that were written by Disturbed prior to their first album , The Sickness , but were never previously released . 
 The album features significantly darker themes than any of Disturbed 's previous work , according to the band . Some of the lyrical themes involve actual experiences that vocalist David Draiman had endured over the course of the past few years prior to making the album , including " bad relationships " , a motorcycle accident that he was involved with , and an incident of suicide . To match the aggressive attitude and nature of said themes , Draiman told the other band members to create darker , more textural music than they have before . Despite these themes , the title track , " Indestructible " , is meant to encourage those in the military that are fighting in wars and boost their morale . 
 Indestructible was released on June 3 , 2008 in Compact Disc format , and also as two different limited edition and special edition digipaks , debuting at number @-@ one on the Billboard 200 , making it the third consecutive number @-@ one debut by Disturbed on that chart , which had only been achieved by five other rock bands prior to the album 's release . The album also shipped over 253 @,@ 000 units in its opening week . Indestructible was met with mixed reviews by critics , earning a score of 57 % on review @-@ aggregating website Metacritic , based on six reviews . The album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 2009 for shipping over 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 copies in the United States . The single " Inside the Fire " was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award in the " Best Hard Rock Performance " category . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 After touring in support of the band 's previous album , Ten Thousand Fists , the band took a break . During this time , drummer Mike Wengren got married , and guitarist Dan Donegan had a child . In February 2007 , after the break was over , the band went to <unk> Studios in Chicago , Illinois and began writing music . Indestructible is Disturbed 's first self @-@ produced effort , without Johnny K acting as producer , as he did on the band 's previous albums , The Sickness , Believe , and Ten Thousand Fists . The band was comfortable with self @-@ producing , despite having Johnny K produce two consecutive number @-@ one albums , and this being their first time without him . As vocalist David Draiman reasoned , " we learned it , and we 'd like to try [ self @-@ producing ] . " 
 Early in the writing process , Donegan created guitar riffs . The rest of the band then listened to the riffs , and wrote the rest of the music , with the riffs being the base . As Donegan commented , " The writing process is ... pretty much the same since the beginning ... of this band . It 's always been riffs ; something musically that I 'll come up with [ that begins the writing process ] . " Wengren commented , " We 're always tossing around riffs and beats , but it isn 't really until we get home and we are able to clear our minds , decompress for a little bit , and then hit it , especially Danny and I , and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out , that the music starts to finally come to life . " Bassist John Moyer left the studio during the recording process , due to his wife being pregnant . Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e @-@ mail , and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio . Regarding electronics on the album , Donegan said , " When the basic guitar , bass , [ and ] drums were being laid down , at first I didn 't really see a whole lot of room for some of the electronics , but as the songs were starting to develop , I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics . " 
 When the instrumentation was completed , Draiman began to write melody lines for each song . Draiman commented , " I 'm a big believer in the vibe of the music and the feel of it , how the song makes you feel musically should dictate what it is to be about and so if you start with something that has meaning , but the music doesn 't support the meaning , then what good is it ? " The first song completed musically was " The Night " , and Draiman completed the melody line in three days . This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record The Night . As Draiman recalled , " The instrumentation was so cool and so dark and textural that I right away kind of jumped into it . " When the first batch of songs were completed , the band sent them out to their record label , Reprise Records , and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs . After they received approval , they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album . 
 Wengren commented , " We thought it would be pretty cool , especially for the fans , if we brought back maybe a song or two , that were actually written during the same period that The Sickness songs were written . Danny brought in some old demo tapes , I 'm talking twelve years old , back when ' Down With the Sickness ' and ' <unk> ' [ sic ] , and all that stuff was written , this was actually written before that . " The songs that Wengren was referring to were " Perfect Insanity " , and " Divide " . The band also recorded a version of the song " Midlife Crisis " , which was originally performed by Faith No More . Draiman comments , " We took the song , revamped it and modernized it to our current level , and the version 's killer . " However , the song did not make it into the final track listing of the album , and is instead featured on Covered , A Revolution in Sound . This version of " Midlife Crisis " later appeared on The Lost Children , the band 's first compilation album . 
 = = = Titling the record = = = 
 Indestructible took the longest amount of time to title when compared to Disturbed 's previous records , according to Wengren . The band had originally wanted to title the record The Night , because it was the first track to be completed , and it defined the musical direction the band wanted to use with Indestructible . The record had a song whose working title was " Defend " , but it eventually was re @-@ titled " Indestructible " . When the title was changed , the band felt the title had , as Donegan reasoned , " made a bigger statement " . Draiman said they titled the record Indestructible because the title " ... kind of symbolizes the fact that we 're still fucking here , that we haven 't been destroyed , that we withstood the test of time . " 
 Regarding the choice of the title , Moyer commented , " Usually there 's some name or phrase that sort of sums up , you know , what the vibe of the record 's about , so this one 's Indestructible , and it is an aggressive record , this record 's about kicking ass . " Donegan , commenting on the meaning of the title , stated , " We feel that we 've become indestructible to be able to survive this long in the business , and continuing a success with it . " Draiman concluded , " We have been through a lot . No matter what gets thrown at us , as a band , no matter what happens in the musical environment , we 're still here , we 're still viable , and still standing . " 
 = = Musical style and lyrical themes = = 
 Vocalist David Draiman states that , lyrically , the album was inspired by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him . " I had a motorcycle accident , and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles , " Draiman commented . " ... I 've had really bad relationships that I 've been in and out of . They 've left their mark " , he concluded . The song " Indestructible " is " an anthem for soldiers " , Draiman comments . " It 's meant to be something that would make them feel invincible , take away their fear , make them strong and that 's what this whole body of work on this record does . It 's music to help you feel strong , " he concludes . Cuts such as " Deceiver " and " Inside the Fire " are about " really bad relationships " . " Inside the Fire " is about " standing over the body of my girlfriend , who just killed herself , and the Devil is standing over me , whispering in my ear to kill myself , " says Draiman . The song " The Night " is , " just kind of meant to portray the night almost as like a living entity that sets you free . You 're enveloped by it , <unk> by it , " Draiman comments . The band 's vocalist also says the song " Perfect Insanity " is about " toying with the idea of insanity . Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [ insane ] and warning people around him , particularly his love interests , about his psychotic tendencies . " Draiman says the track " Divide " " is meant to detract from the idea ' oh , let 's all be one , let 's all be united ! ' Fuck that , be yourself , be an individual , stand out , make your mark , make an impact . " Commenting on the meaning of the song " Façade " , Draiman says it is , " ... a song from the perspective of a girl in a relationship where she 's abused ... she 's thinking about killing him , like you see on the news . " 
 To match the themes Draiman had in mind , he told his bandmates , " give me your darkest , nastiest , [ most ] aggressive tribal rhythmic shit you can throw at me " . Prior to the release of the album , guitarist Dan Donegan supported this , stating , " musically , it 's a lot ballsier than we 've written [ before ] . " He continued , saying , " [ We 're ] trying to get a good blend of the elements of the past three CDs to try to evolve into something fresh and new for us as well . " Dan Marsicano of 411mania commented on the song " Perfect Insanity " , claiming it has " ... a short but sweet shredding solo , double bass drum work , and fast picked riffing ... " . He goes on to propose the same for the song " Divide " , saying it " follows the same pattern [ as " Perfect Insanity " ] , with aggressive guitar work followed through by Draiman 's vocals ... " Marsicano also proposes that " Inside the Fire " has " ... a memorable solo and a dark theme surrounding it , " and says that " The Night " is an " epic @-@ sounding track that has one of the best solos that Donegan has ever done and a catchy chorus . " Chris Akin of <unk> proposes that the album is full of hooks , and that guitarist Donegan takes a " much more 80s approach " , due to his guitar solos . Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone proposes that the album contains " meticulously constructed guitar <unk> , serrated verses and cathartic refrains " . 
 = = Promotion = = 
 The marketing campaign for Indestructible began in late 2007 , with a strategy of releasing content for fans early and often . Promotion began with distributing stickers at live events . Reprise Records also partnered with Hot Topic retailers , who thereafter put an Indestructible album teaser on all Disturbed merchandise , and eventually began selling a limited edition 7 " vinyl record with two songs from the album on it . In March 2008 , Disturbed performed a concert in Kuwait for United States military stationed there . The concert was streamed live on MySpace , and more than three million people viewed it . In February 2008 , an audio sample was posted on Disturbed 's MySpace profile to promote Indestructible . The sample , titled " Perfect Insanity " , is actually a song written early in the band 's career that never previously appeared on an album , but was expected to appear on the album . The track was later made available for download , in its entirety , on Disturbed 's website for promotional purposes . Another sample , titled " Inside the Fire " , appeared on Rock on the Range 's MySpace profile in March 2008 . The track was anticipated to be the first single released from the album , with a music video directed by Nathan Cox . On March 24 , 2008 " Inside the Fire " debuted on more than sixty radio stations . It was released for digital download the next day . On May 2 , 2008 the music video for " Inside the Fire " debuted on Disturbed 's website . 
 In April 2008 , a limited edition pre @-@ order digipak of Indestructible was made available for order exclusively through Disturbed 's website . The limited edition package featured the entire album , a B @-@ side track entitled " Run " , a DVD featuring a documentary about the making of the album and some instructional videos , a " wrap @-@ around " poster , a special VIP laminate which grants access to special Disturbed events through 2009 , and a special code which grants access to the " Inside the Fire " special website add @-@ on . Another special edition pre @-@ order of the album was on iTunes Music Store , and featured three live bonus tracks , as well as the entire album . Yet another pre @-@ order of the album allowed customers who pre @-@ ordered the album through Best Buy retailers to download the two songs , " Inside the Fire " , and " Indestructible " as playable content on the video game Rock Band . Three songs from Disturbed 's first online concert performance at <unk> were mastered and featured on the EP Live & Indestructible . On August 20 , 2008 a music video directed by Noble Jones for the album 's third single and title track , " Indestructible " , was posted on Disturbed 's website . The single was released digitally on September 29 , 2008 , and the music video was officially available for purchase the next day , packaged with the EP Live & Indestructible . Jones also directed the music video for the fourth single from Indestructible , " The Night " , in January 2009 , and it was released in late March 2009 .

 On the review @-@ aggregating website Metacritic , Indestructible received a score of 57 % , based on six reviews . Being the first self @-@ produced effort by the band , they had more leeway to create music without any outside interference , suggests 411mania writer Dan Marsicano . He concludes that the self @-@ production also led to a lack of guidance , though , which ultimately works against the album , rather than helping it . Guitarist Dan Donegan 's guitar work was praised , and About.com writer Chad Bowar notes many songs on the album are guitar @-@ driven . <unk> writer Chris Akin also praises Donegan , saying , " If there is growth in the band , it 's in the guitars . Dan Donegan takes a much more 80s approach than he has on past recordings . " Allmusic writer James Monger praised Indestructible , suggesting that rather than taking melodic elements from acts like Pantera , like Disturbed 's previous records are suggested to , the album takes musical elements from acts such as Metallica or AC / DC . 
 Indestructible did , however , receive criticism . IGN writer Jim Kaz proposes that vocalist David Draiman has an " overly @-@ forced " vocal delivery . Kaz also finds , " The tunes are largely similar in style and structure ... In essence , there 's very little that stands out . " He goes on to say that the album already seems obsolete , " There 's just too much of the very recent past on Indestructible to move away from it . So in effect , it sounds a bit dated ... already . " It is also suggested that , although possessing a reliably solid foundation , the album lacks a meaning behind its drive : " They wind up sounding a little lost on Indestructible , stabbing their weapons without any reasons behind each parry , " says PopMatters writer Andrew Blackie .

 = M @-@ 75 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 75 is a 11 @.@ 768 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 18 @.@ 939 km ) segment of state trunkline highway located in Charlevoix County in the U.S. state of Michigan . This highway serves as a loop off US Highway 131 ( US 131 ) , providing access to Boyne City . The highway happens to be geographically close to Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) , but they are not related . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 75 begins in downtown Boyne Falls at an intersection with US 131 . It follows Mill Street northwesterly out of town , passing to the north of a lake and the Boyne Mountain Airport . The airport property ends at the intersection with C @-@ 48 west of Boyne Falls . M @-@ 75 runs parallel to the Boyne River until it turns west near the Boyne City Municipal Airport to enter the community of Boyne City on East Division Street . Two blocks further west , it meets C @-@ 73 / East Jordan Road next to the Maple Lawn Cemetery . Next to the cemetery , the highway follows Boyne Avenue northwesterly into downtown . The trunkline turns north on East Street to cross the Boyne River and then turns east on State Street passing Rotary Park on the way out of town . The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) measures the average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) in traffic surveys . AADT is a measure of the average traffic levels for a section of roadway on any given day of the year . The southern segment of M @-@ 75 carried 6 @,@ 500 vehicles daily in the 2007 survey . Of these vehicles , commercial traffic was measured at 280 trucks . 
 East of Boyne City , M @-@ 75 turns northward and runs in that direction until turning again to follow the south shore of Walloon Lake . There it follows North Shore Drive into the town of Walloon Lake . M @-@ 75 ends at an intersection with US 131 . The roadway continues eastward as C @-@ 81 / Springvale Road . This northern segment carried 4 @,@ 100 vehicles and 170 trucks in 2007 . Neither segment is listed on the National Highway System , a system of strategically important highways . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1919 , the trunkline running through Boyne City was originally labeled M @-@ 57 . In 1927 , the entire highway was renumbered , and since this change , the trunkline has carried the M @-@ 75 moniker . The M @-@ 75 designation was left unaltered when US 27 between Gaylord and Indian River was converted to a freeway ; this freeway was redesignated as I @-@ 75 in 1962 . Some states , such as California , do not allow two highways in their state to carry the same highway number , which is not the case in Michigan . A reconstruction project in 1966 bypassed some sharp curves in the roadway and straightened sections between Boyne City and Walloon Lake . As of 2008 , the highway remains unaltered since the reconstruction .

 = Battle of Kupres ( 1992 ) = 
 The Battle of Kupres ( Bosnian , Croatian , Serbian : Bitka za Kupres ) was a battle of the Bosnian War , fought between the Bosnian Croat Territorial Defence Force ( Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) supported by the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) troops on one side and the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA ) , augmented by the Bosnian Serb TO on the other at the Kupres Plateau , on 3 – 11 April 1992 . During the fighting on 8 April the Bosnian Croat TO was reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council ( Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO ) . The objective of the battle was control of the strategic Kupres Plateau , controlling a major supply route . 
 The opposing sides began bringing in reinforcements to the Kupres Plateau on 5 March to strengthen positions held around individual settlements populated by different ethnic groups , communications between those positions , and roads leading away from the plateau to the north and south . Different parts of the town of Kupres were controlled by the opposing forces , while the adjacent territory surrounding the town was controlled by the Bosnian Croat TO . In turn , that territory was surrounded by Bosnian Serb TO @-@ held territory . By the end of the month , the bulk of the civilians living in the area were evacuated . On 2 April , negotiations to defuse the situation failed while the reinforcements continued to arrive . The battle commenced the next day . In Kupres itself , the Bosnian Croat TO achieved minor territorial gains on 4 – 5 April , before the JNA managed to advance to the outskirts of the town the next day . The JNA entered Kupres in the afternoon of 7 April and in the next few days , it successfully drove the Croatian forces from the plateau . The breakthrough came about after the infantry originally deployed to the battle was reinforced by an armoured battalion deployed from Knin . 
 Croatian forces were hampered by an inadequate command structure , poor coordination and lack heavy weapons . The battle resulted in more than 200 killed on both sides , and established lines of control which would remain unchanged until 1994 , when the plateau was recaptured by the HVO . In 2012 , Republika Srpska authorities charged seven Croats with war crimes committed at the plateau against civilians and prisoners of war . The next year , Croatian authorities charged 21 former JNA members with war crimes against HVO prisoners captured at the Kupres Plateau . 
 = = Background = = 
 As the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA ) withdrew from Croatia following the implementation of the Vance plan , it was reorganised into a new Bosnian Serb army . This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992 , ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina . This declaration was later cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for the Bosnian War . Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital , Sarajevo , and other areas on 1 March . On the following day , the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj . On 27 March , Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery , drawing a border crossing by the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) 108th Brigade in response . 
 Control of the Kupres area was contested by Bosnian Serbs and Croats . Before the war , the former represented the majority of the population on the Kupres Plateau , comprising a total of 51 percent of its inhabitants , while Croats accounted for 39 percent . The JNA deployed an armoured unit based in Mostar to the plateau in May 1991 . The bulk of the force moved to Knin three months later , while a tactical group of the 30th Partisan Division redeployed to the general area as it withdrew from Slovenia after the Ten @-@ Day War . In September , the Bosnian Croats established the Territorial Defence Force ( Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) headquarters which set up armed volunteer units . By November , these units had been organised as the Kupres Battalion . The battalion consisted of five companies and an independent platoon . A Central Intelligence Agency report described the unit as a " barely organized collection of mostly local villagers and townspeople " . The arming of the various forces was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September 1991 . In early 1992 , the 30th Partisan Division was subordinated to the JNA 5th ( Banja Luka ) Corps and assigned Kupres as its area of responsibility ( AOR ) . The division , likely comprising only 2 @,@ 000 troops , was under the command of Colonel Stanislav <unk> . As of 19 March , the 5th ( Banja Luka ) Corps was under command of Lieutenant General Momir Talić . 
 In April , the Bosnian Serbs were able to deploy 200 @,@ 000 troops , hundreds of tanks , armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) and artillery pieces . The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25 @,@ 000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons , while the Bosniaks were largely unprepared for combat with nearly 100 @,@ 000 troops , but small arms for less than half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 On 5 March , the Bosnian Serb TO requested equipment for two companies mobilised in villages around Kupres — Malovan , Rilić and Ravno . The mobilisation was motivated by poor military intelligence provided by the 30th Partisan Division . It indicated the presence of thousands of HV and Bosnian Croat troops in the vicinity of Kupres , supported by Leopard 1 tanks drawn from a contingent of approximately 100 Leopards that the JNA believed had been delivered to Croatia . In response , the division was tasked to deploy its elements to Kupres , Ključ , Mrkonjić Grad , Šipovo , Jajce and the Mount Vlašić , take command of the Bosnian Serb TO and repel the expected Croatian attack . In order to achieve this , the division mobilised the 1st , 13th and 19th Partisan Brigades — assigning Kupres to the 19th Brigade as its AOR . By 23 March , the brigade received mobilised troops sufficient to set up three companies . Their immediate task was to block the Malovan and Kupreška Vrata mountain passes . The next day , the divisional commander toured the plateau and was informed that the Bosnian Croat forces were in control of the villages of Olovo , Osmanlije and Zlosela , in addition to Kupreška Vrata . On 26 March , the Bosnian Serb TO battalion based in Malovan was subordinated to the 19th Partisan Brigade . At this time , both sides had a relatively small portion of their force inside Kupres , while the Bosnian Croat TO held the area adjacently surrounding the town . The Bosnian Serb TO and the JNA completely controlled the areas surrounding the Bosnian Croat TO force . 
 The Malovan @-@ based battalion set up its first roadblock on 26 March , and the Kupres Battalion established its own checkpoints in response the following day . On 27 March , an attempt to reach a negotiated settlement failed and the commanding officer of the 19th Partisan Brigade announced that armed combat might start at a moment 's notice . The news prompted the evacuation of civilians of all ethnicities on 27 – 28 March . According to the daily report of the 30th Partisan Division of 29 March , the Kupres Plateau was deserted except for able bodied and armed men . The same report noted that the JNA could not deploy to Kupres itself without a fight . The JNA was convinced that the HV had intervened at Kupres to threaten the Bosnian Serbs . Kupres had a high strategic value , because it sat astride a road linking the towns of Bugojno and Tomislavgrad from the central Bosnia region to western Herzegovina and further on to Croatia . 
 = = = Reinforcements = = = 
 On 29 March , the 5th ( Banja Luka ) Corps of the JNA decided took the initiative around Kupres , redeploying elements of the 1st Battalion of the 13th Partisan Brigade to the Kupres Plateau , along with units drawn from the 9th ( Knin ) Corps , and the 293rd Engineer Regiment . A company of the 3rd Battalion of the 13th Partisan Brigade was also moved to the plateau on the following day , while the rest of the brigade was ordered to be ready to move to Kupres . The Kupres Battalion of the Bosnian Croat TO mobilised an additional 200 troops in Kupres the same day . On 31 March , the strengthened 1st Motorised Battalion of the 11th Motorised Infantry Brigade , drawn from the 9th ( Knin ) Corps , arrived at the Kupres Plateau . The battalion was strengthened by the addition of a battery of five 120 @-@ millimetre ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) mortars , six 105 @-@ millimetre ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) howitzers , three 76 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) ZiS @-@ 3 guns and a platoon of 82 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) recoilless rifles . 
 In the afternoon of 2 April , a five @-@ hour meeting of local political leaders took place in Kupres , at the request of JNA . The purpose of the meeting , attended by members of Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina , Biljana Plavšić and Franjo Boras , was to defuse the situation . While there was an agreement to establish an ethnically balanced police force in Kupres and remove the roadblocks , the opposing sides could not agree on the role of the JNA . The Bosnian Serbs wanted the JNA to deploy to Kupres itself to ensure their protection , while the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks wanted it to leave . During that same day , the 30th Partisan Division ordered the forces under its command , as well as the recent reinforcements , to capture Kupres and Kupreška Vrata and then hold their ground against anticipated Croatian counterattacks . Bosnian Croat authorities ordered the mobilisation of TO units in the nearby towns of Tomislavgrad and Posušje , with an armoured force at their disposal consisting of two T @-@ 55 tanks , two M36 tank destroyers , and one BVP M @-@ 80 infantry fighting vehicle . 
 There were 100 – 200 HV troops in Kupres during the battle . Those included a group drawn from the 204th Brigade , led by Robert Zadro ( son of late <unk> Zadro , former commander of the 3rd Battalion of the brigade ) . During the fighting , elements of the Zrinski Battalion reached Kupres , while relatively small groups of soldiers drawn from the Frankopan Battalion and the 4th Guards Brigade arrived when the battle was nearly over . A company drawn from the 126th Infantry Brigade was deployed in Šuica , but it is unclear if it actively took part in the battle . There were also Croatian Defence Forces ( Hrvatske obrambene snage – HOS ) units raised in Tomislavgrad and Posušje , which were involved in the fighting around Kupres . At the time , overall command of the Bosnian Croat forces was held by Brigadier Milivoj Petković . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 = = = 3 April = = = 
 According to the JNA , the Bosnian Croat TO attacked in the morning of 3 April , reached the village of Donji Malovan and blockaded the Kupreška Vrata Tunnel by 7 : 30 a.m. The village was captured by Croats after three hours of combat , and the fighting shifted towards the village of Gornji Malovan and Kupres . By the end of the day , the Bosnian Serb TO force in Gornji Malovan was besieged . The JNA instructed the Yugoslav Air Force to attack after it received reports that 15 HV tanks had appeared on the battlefield . The 30th Partisan Division staff amended the plans formulated the previous day and advanced with elements of the 11th Motorised Brigade towards Kupres via Zlosela , against positions held by the Kupres Battalion at 1 : 15 p.m. The change of plans enabled elements of the 13th Partisan Brigade to catch up to them by 6 : 00 p.m. and caused the attack to fail . 
 Following news of the fighting , the 5th ( Banja Luka ) Corps called on its troops deployed in western Slavonia to reinforce the 30th Partisan Division . The corps felt it could weaken its positions in western Slavonia because the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) peacekeepers were expected to deploy there by the end of the month based on the Vance plan . Those troops consisted of the Volunteer Battalion of the 5th Corps , and they were augmented by the 2nd Howitzer Battalion of the 5th Mixed Artillery Regiment . The 1st Battery of the 5th Light Anti @-@ Aircraft Defence Regiment was also added to the battalion . 
 = = = 4 – 5 April = = = 
 On 4 April , the Bosnian Croat TO captured Gornji Malovan . At the same time , the Bosnian Croat TO received reinforcements from Posušje , as well as a company from Bugojno and Uskoplje each . Fighting intensified as the JNA reinforcements arrived . A part of the Croatian reinforcements , which had just arrived from Bugojno and Uskoplje , fled after coming under attack near Zlosela . However , the JNA failed to achieve a breakthrough — even with five attack helicopters deployed in support of its advance towards Zlosela and Kupreška Vrata at 1 : 30 p.m. 
 The forces attacking towards Kupreška Vrata were redeployed the next day to assist in the advance towards Zlosela . In Kupres itself , the Bosnian Croat TO secured the western part of the town , as well as Gornji Malovan . Regardless , no significant territory changed hands . Although the 9th ( Knin ) Corps dispatched ten tanks to Kupres from its 9th Tank Company , commanded by Colonel Slavko Lisica , only four of them reached Kupres , as six broke down along the way . In the town of Kupres itself , the Bosnian Croat TO was reinforced by the arrival of a group drawn from the HV special forces Zrinski Battalion . The 30th Partisan Division lost contact with the JNA troops ( 1st Battalion of the 19th Partisan Brigade ) in Kupres at 1 : 00 p.m. 
 = = = 6 April = = = 
 At dawn on 6 April , the JNA launched a fresh attack towards Kupres and Kupreška Vrata , leaving the bulk of the 13th Partisan Brigade in reserve and employing the rest of the force at the plateau . The artillery was used so intensely that the 30th Partisan Division had to request resupply of its depleted stocks . The most effective part of the advance was the 9th Tank Company , which quickly pushed through the defensive positions , bypassed Zlosela and reached Olovo . In contrast , the Bosnian Croat TO command in Kupres was overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation and could not track which units it had at its disposal — even losing track of units physically near the command post . 
 The JNA further reinforced its position at the Kupres Plateau by ordering the redeployment of the 9th Armoured Battalion of the 9th ( Knin ) Corps to the area . It also established the Operational Group 11 ( OG @-@ 11 ) which was to take over the operation on 7 April , when the AOR of the 9th Corps was extended to the region . At the same time , the armoured and mechanised assets of the force were organised into the Tactical Group 1 ( TG @-@ 1 ) , commanded by Lisica . By the end of the day , the divisional reserve was committed to the battle , and the JNA claimed that they had captured Zlosela , Olovo and Osmanlije , as well as reaching the outskirts of Kupres . The Bosnian Croat TO captured the centre of Kupres and brought the 1st Battalion of the 19th Partisan Brigade into a difficult position , only to begin withdrawing towards Tomislavgrad after the main JNA force reached the town in the night of 6 / 7 April . Likewise , the Bosnian Croat TO started to pull back from Kupreška Vrata . 
 = = = 7 April = = = 
 On 7 April , the bulk of the 9th Armoured Battalion arrived on the battlefield , adding 17 T @-@ 55s , eight M @-@ 60 APCs and five BVP M @-@ 80s . The unit entered Kupres in the late afternoon , followed by two battalions of the 13th Partisan Brigade . A battalion of the 11th Motorised Brigade performed mopping up operations in the Zlosela area . A part of the Bosnian Croat TO force was retreating in disarray , while a portion of the force was trapped in Kupres and Zlosela , trying to break out . In the evening , as the mop @-@ up of the Olovo and Osmanlije area was completed , the OG @-@ 11 ordered attacks against Gornji Malovan and Donji Malovan . The next day , the TG @-@ 1 received a commendation by the commander of the 9th ( Knin ) Corps , Major General Ratko Mladić . 
 = = = Final operations = = = 
 After it captured Kupres , the OG @-@ 11 turned south , in the direction of Gornji Malovan , Donji Malovan and Šuica . The attack , spearheaded by the 9th Armoured Battalion , reached Gornji Malovan on 10 April , the day Robert Zadro was killed . Fighting continued around Kupres until 11 April . Most of the Bosnian Croat TO troops , formally reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council ( Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO ) on 8 April , withdrew from the Kupres Plateau towards Šuica , while a small portion of the troops was forced to retreat via the Mount Cincar towards Livno . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Sources disagree on the number of Bosnian Croat and HV casualties . Their number is variously reported as 160 or 177 killed . The Bosnian Serbs and the JNA sustained losses of 85 killed and 154 taken prisoner of war . The JNA also captured 23 Bosnian Croat TO troops . The figures are reported to include 19 civilian deaths on each side . Even though the Serbian media initially reported that the villages of Gornji Malovan and Donji Malovan had been torched and razed to the ground , the information proved to be incorrect — the settlements sustained relatively minor damage . Conversely , <unk> or Bosniak @-@ inhabited villages were looted and torched . Zlosela suffered extensive damage — the village school was the only structure with a roof left in place . 
 Command and coordination of the Bosnian Croat forces had been particularly poor throughout the battle . HV General Janko Bobetko arrived in Tomislavgrad on 11 April to find that a company of the HV 126th Infantry Brigade , deployed to Šuica , had left its positions on its own accord . The move was followed by preparations for the evacuation of Šuica in expectation of a JNA advance south from Kupres . Bobetko managed to turn the 126th Brigade back to Šuica , persuading them to defend the town overnight in order to defend the entire region . It is not clear if the OG @-@ 11 intended to continue its advance towards Šuica though . Soon after the Battle of Kupres , a portion of the 9th Armoured Battalion was transferred to Glamoč to support the Bosnian Serb TO attack towards Livno there . The lines of control stabilised and would not shift in the area for more than two years , until the 1994 Battle of Kupres . By mid @-@ May 1992 , Bosnian Serb forces controlled approximately 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina . 
 = = = War crime charges = = = 
 In 2012 , Republika Srpska authorities charged seven Bosnian Croat officials and HVO officers with the killings of 19 Serb civilians , and 20 members of the Bosnian Serb TO in the area of Kupres in 1992 . The charges also pertained to the abuse of 18 prisoners of war captured in the Battle of Kupres . In 2013 , Croatian authorities in Šibenik charged 21 former members of the JNA with the abuse of 23 HVO prisoners of war . The charges specify that the prisoners were detained and abused in Knin prison between 24 April and 14 May . The abuse is alleged to have caused the deaths of two of the prisoners and grave injuries to three others .

 Rhodes started his football career at non @-@ League side Newmarket Town , breaking into the club 's youth team at the age of 17 . He combined his early years at the club with work as a coach at Cambridge Regional College . During the 2002 – 03 season , Rhodes scored more than 30 goals . He continued his goal @-@ scoring form the following season and three successive hat @-@ tricks in September 2003 attracted the attention of league scouts , including Norwich City , Cambridge United and Yeovil Town . He scored 21 goals for Newmarket in the Eastern Counties League during the first four months of the 2003 – 04 season . After trials with Yeovil , Norwich and Ipswich Town , Rhodes signed with Brentford in November 2003 for £ 10 @,@ 000 . It was the first time Brentford had paid a transfer fee for a player since Jean @-@ Philippe Javary three years earlier , with the money donated by the club 's fans . In his final game with Newmarket , he scored a hat @-@ trick in a 4 – 3 victory against Great Yarmouth Town . 
 = = = Brentford = = = 
 Rhodes made his Brentford debut on Boxing Day 2003 in a 2 – 1 defeat to Bristol City but had to wait more than four months for his second game . He scored his first senior goal in his third game to ensure Brentford avoided relegation from the Second Division when they defeated Bournemouth 1 – 0 . 
 Rhodes returned to Newmarket Town for a pre @-@ season friendly game with Brentford in August 2004 , during which he scored a hat @-@ trick in a 5 – 0 win . It helped him to win a place in the first team , and he scored on the first day of the 2004 – 05 season when Brentford lost 3 – 1 to Chesterfield . It was not until November 2004 that he scored his second goal in another defeat — 2 – 1 to Bradford City . Five days later , he scored the winning penalty against Bristol City to take Brentford through to the second round of the FA Cup . In December , Rhodes scored in successive games , first in the league against Sheffield Wednesday , then another penalty in the FA Cup as Brentford 's 2 – 1 victory against Hinckley United set up a third round tie with Luton Town . He was unable to play in the third round tie after he suffered a serious knee injury against Walsall which kept him out of action for the rest of the season . Although Rhodes had been a regular in the Brentford squad , his 22 league games included just four starts . 
 Injury again hit Rhodes ' 2005 – 06 season , during which he scored just one goal in a 2 – 1 victory over Yeovil Town . He started just five league games during the season , as Brentford reached the League One play @-@ offs . Rhodes started the second leg of the play @-@ off semi @-@ finals but a 2 – 0 defeat to Swansea City denied them a place in the final . 
 He made 11 appearances for Brentford at the start of the 2006 – 07 season , but on 10 October 2006 , Rhodes signed for League Two side Swindon Town on a month 's loan deal . He made his debut for Swindon against Grimsby Town , when he had a goal disallowed . Rhodes played just four games for Swindon all as substitute without scoring before returning to Brentford , before being immediately placed on the transfer list by Brentford manager Scott Fitzgerald . Rhodes played another three games for Brentford and had a trial with Yeovil Town in January 2007 but stayed with Brentford . In March 2007 , he was loaned out again , to Conference side Grays Athletic for seven weeks . He played 12 league games and twice in the FA Trophy during his spell at Grays , scoring once in each competition , before he returned to Brentford in time to play in their final game of the season . Rhodes was offered a new contract by new Brentford manager Terry Butcher but turned it down and left the club on 25 June 2007 . He played 65 games in all competitions for Brentford , but two @-@ thirds of those were as substitute , scoring just six goals .

 After trials with League Two sides Darlington and Bradford City , Rhodes signed for the latter on a short @-@ term deal . He made his debut in City 's first game of the season when they drew 1 – 1 with Macclesfield Town in a team featuring six new players . He scored his first goal in a 2 – 1 win over Chester City on 6 November 2007 . He extended his stay at Bradford City until the end of the season in January 2008 . Despite signing a new contract , injury kept Rhodes out of the side at the start of 2008 until 23 February when he scored his second Bradford goal in a 3 – 1 victory at Notts County after coming on as substitute . His performance in the Notts County victory earned him a place in the starting side three days later when he again scored in a 3 – 2 win against Rotherham United . On 29 April , he was one of 13 players released by manager Stuart McCall . Rhodes played a total of 30 games for Bradford , but started only 11 of those , scoring three goals .

 In June 2008 , Rhodes returned to League Two , when he signed a one @-@ year deal with Rotherham United , after their manager Mark Robins was impressed by Rhodes ' performance against them the previous season . Rotherham were deducted 17 points at the start of the 2008 – 09 season because of improperly exiting administration . They started the season with a 1 – 0 against Lincoln City , in which Rhodes made his debut before he was substituted in the second half . He scored his first goal for Rotherham in a League Cup first round tie against local rivals Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough on 12 August 2008 . Rhodes ' goal game only seconds after Wednesday had opened the scoring , before the game finished 2 – 2 . Rotherham eventually won through to the second round on penalties . His first league goal for the club came less than two weeks later as Rotherham beat Chester City 3 – 1 to maintain their winning start to the season . Rhodes was a regular in the Rotherham side at the start of the season as the team overhauled their point deduction to go above Grimsby Town in the league , but he was dropped for a game against his former side Bradford City in November 2008 . He briefly returned to the side the following month for a Football League Trophy area semi @-@ final with Darlington , which Rotherham won on penalties , but did not play again until the two sides met once more in a league game at the end of January 2009 . 
 It was only a brief return to the side and two months later Rhodes joined Conference National side Woking on loan for the rest of the season . His debut for Woking came two days later in the club 's 1 – 1 draw with Wrexham , with Rhodes being substituted towards the end of the second half by Joel <unk> . He played three games for Woking , scoring one goal . Rhodes returned to Rotherham but was released by the club having played 18 games and scoring four goals during his one season stay .

 Having been released , Rhodes returned to the Conference by joining Oxford United on a free transfer in May 2009 . Rhodes made his Oxford debut in their opening game of the season against York City as a second @-@ half substitute for Jack <unk> to help his team come from 1 – 0 down to win 2 – 1 . However , after he had played just four games , Rhodes left by mutual consent . 
 Rhodes immediately joined Conference South side Braintree Town , initially on a contract until the start of January . His new assistant manager Jason Broom described Rhodes as an " exciting " talent . He made his debut against St Albans City helping to create his new side 's goal in a 1 – 1 draw . Rhodes failed to impress and was released after Christmas 2009 . 
 Rhodes rejoined former club Grays Athletic , where he had played on loan in 2007 , on 19 January 2010 . He scored a goal on his debut in a hastily arranged friendly , after their league game with Kidderminster Harriers was postponed , later in the week during a 4 – 1 victory against <unk> . Rhodes ' senior debut came at the end of the same week , when he was one of six new members of manager Julian Dicks ' side , only for them to lose 4 – 0 to Rhodes ' former team Oxford United . Rhodes was substituted by Harry <unk> during the second half . He was released at the end of the 2009 – 10 season , having made 15 appearances . 
 Rhodes instead started to train with A.F.C. Sudbury and played in a pre @-@ season friendly against Bury Town , during which he scored to help Sudbury win 4 – 3 . However , although Rhodes said he would like to join the semi @-@ professional Isthmian League Division One North side , he wanted to keep his options open in case he could remain in the professional game . A week later , he was given a trial with League Two Hereford United . Instead , the following week , Rhodes signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Canvey Island and immediately went into the first @-@ team to make his debut on 28 August in a home league match against Carshalton Athletic , which finished 1 – 1 , with Rhodes close to scoring what would have been a late winning goal for his new club . Rhodes ' first goals for Canvey Island came in a FA Cup first round qualifying match against Newport Pagnell Town , scoring twice in a 4 – 1 victory . He scored again in the next round to put Canvey into the third qualifying round . Rhodes signed a contract to keep him with the club until the end of the season and scored two more in Canvey 's ultimate exit from the FA Cup .

West was a shy , introverted boy , who became even more withdrawn when his closest brother David died in the Korean War at age 22 when Jerry was 12 . He was so small and frail that he needed vitamin injections from his doctor and was kept apart from children 's sports , to prevent him from getting seriously hurt . Growing up , West spent his days hunting and fishing , but his main distraction was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed . West spent days shooting baskets from every possible angle , ignoring mud and snow in the backyard , as well as his mother 's whippings when he came home hours late for dinner ; he played so often that the NBA acknowledged it as " obsessive " .

 West attended high school in East Bank , West Virginia from 1952 to 1956 . During his first year , he was mostly benched by his coach Duke Shaver due to his lack of height . Shaver emphasized the importance of conditioning and defense , lessons which the teenager appreciated . Soon , West became the captain of the freshman team and , during the summer of 1953 , he grew to 6 ft 0 in ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) . Eventually becoming the team 's starting small forward , West quickly established himself as one of the finest West Virginian high school players of his generation . He was named All @-@ State from 1953 – 56 , then All @-@ American in 1956 when he was West Virginia Player of the Year , becoming the state 's first high @-@ school player to score more than 900 points in a season , with an average of 32 @.@ 2 points per game . West 's mid @-@ range jump shot became his trademark and he often used it to score while under pressure from opposing defense . West led East Bank to a state championship on March 24 that year , prompting East Bank High School to change its name to " West Bank High School " every year on March 24 in honor of their basketball prodigy , until its closure in 1999 .

 After graduating from high school in 1956 , more than 60 universities showed interest in West , and he eventually chose to attend West Virginia University ( WVU ) , located in Morgantown . In his freshman year ( 1956 – 57 ) , West was a member of the WVU freshman squad that achieved a perfect record of 17 wins without a loss over the course of the season ; other team members included Jay Jacobs and Willie Akers . In his first varsity year under head coach Fred Schaus , West scored 17 @.@ 8 points per game and averaged 11 @.@ 1 rebounds ; he also started in all 28 games while shooting 49 @.@ 6 % from the field and 73 @.@ 2 % from the free throw line . These performances earned him a multitude of honors , among them an All @-@ American Third Team call @-@ up ; First Team All @-@ Southern Conference ; Southern Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player Award and First Team honors ; Chuck Taylor @-@ Converse Second @-@ team All @-@ American honors ; and Associated Press and United Press International Third @-@ team All @-@ American honors . The Mountaineers went 26 – 2 that year , ending the season with a loss to Manhattan College in post @-@ season tournament play . 
 During his junior year ( 1958 – 59 ) , West scored 26 @.@ 6 points per game and grabbed 12 @.@ 3 rebounds per game . He tied the NCAA five @-@ game tournament record of 160 points ( 32 @.@ 0 points per game ) and led all scorers and rebounders in every West Virginia game , including getting 28 points and 11 rebounds in a 71 – 70 loss to California in the final . West was named Most Outstanding Player of that year 's Final Four . Further awards were All @-@ American , Southern Conference Tournament MVP and Southern Conference Player of the Year and Athlete of the Year . He was also named to be a member of the U.S. Pan American Games basketball team which won the gold medal . West demonstrated his tenacity to the game in a match against the Kentucky Wildcats ; an incident in the game broke his nose , but he continued playing despite intense pain and having to breathe through his mouth . He scored 19 points in the second @-@ half , leading WVU to an upset victory . 
 In his final collegiate season ( 1959 – 60 ) West averaged several career highs , such as scoring 29 @.@ 3 points per game , a 134 season @-@ assists , 16 @.@ 5 rebounds per game , and a shooting average of 50 @.@ 4 % from the field , 76 @.@ 6 % from the free throw line . He was honored again with several awards : a call @-@ up to the All @-@ American selection , and being voted Southern Conference MVP . West 's best performance was a game against Virginia , in which he grabbed 16 rebounds and scored 40 points . Moreover , during that final year , he had 30 double @-@ doubles and fifteen 30 @-@ point games . In his collegiate career , West totaled 2 @,@ 309 points and 1 @,@ 240 rebounds . He averaged 24 @.@ 8 points per game and 13 @.@ 3 rebounds . As of 2011 , West holds 12 WVU all @-@ time records . Along with Oscar Robertson , West co @-@ captained the U.S. men 's basketball team at the 1960 Summer Olympics and won the gold medal .

 West then made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft , and was drafted with the 2nd overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers , shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles . West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise . His college coach was also hired to coach the Lakers . He played West as a guard , in contrast to West 's college days as a forward . The Lakers were captained by Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame forward Elgin Baylor , who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix ; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins ; and guards Rod Hundley ( from West Virginia , like West ) , Frank Selvy , and Bob Leonard . This team perennially had strong forwards and guards , but was constantly weak at center , giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame center , Bill Russell . 
 Initially , West felt odd in his new environment . He was a loner . His high @-@ pitched voice earned him the nickname " Tweety Bird " , and he spoke with such a thick Appalachian accent that his teammates also referred to him as " Zeke from Cabin Creek " ( his nickname acknowledged his country roots , and his accent was so thick that he squeaked his nickname sheepishly - " Zeek fr 'm Cab 'n Creek " ) . However , West soon impressed his colleagues with his defensive hustle , with his vertical jump — he could reach up 16 inches above the rim when he went up — and with his work ethic , spending countless extra hours working on his game . On the floor , West scored 17 @.@ 6 points , grabbed 7 @.@ 7 rebounds and gave 4 @.@ 2 assists per game . West won Schaus 's trust and , alternating with Hundley , Selvy , and Leonard , played 35 minutes per game and established himself as the Lakers ' second scoring option . The NBA commented that the Lakers now had a potent one @-@ two @-@ punch — with " Mr. Inside " ( the low @-@ post scorer , Baylor ) and " Mr. Outside " ( the long @-@ distance shooter , West ) . These performances soon earned West his first of fourteen NBA All @-@ Star Game call @-@ ups . 
 West helped the Lakers improve from their previous 25 @-@ win season to 36 wins as they reached the 1961 NBA Playoffs . They needed all five games to put away the Detroit Pistons ; but then lost to the St. Louis Hawks in seven games , losing the final game 105 – 103 . 
 In West 's second NBA season , the Lakers could only make limited use of Baylor , who was called up by the U.S. Army Reserves and could play only 48 games . However , West seamlessly took over the role of team leader and established himself as the main Lakers scorer , averaging 30 @.@ 8 points , 7 @.@ 9 rebounds and 5 @.@ 4 assists per game , winning All @-@ NBA First Team honors . West became known especially for hitting important late @-@ game shots , and Lakers ' announcer Chick Hearn named him " Mr. Clutch " a handle which stuck with West for his entire career . 
 The Lakers won 54 regular season games and secured a first @-@ round bye in the 1962 NBA Playoffs . They beat the Pistons four games to two to advance to the 1962 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics . The teams split the first two games , and at the end of Game 3 in Los Angeles , West tied the game at 115 . The Celtics ' Sam Jones inbounded the ball at half @-@ court with three seconds left . West stole the ball , raced upcourt , and converted a running layup as the buzzer sounded . The Celtics tied the series in Game 6 at three games apiece , and the teams headed to Boston for Game 7 . For most of the game , the Lakers trailed , but West and Frank Selvy hit several clutch baskets and tied the game at 100 . Selvy then missed an open 8 @-@ foot shot which would have won the Lakers their first title . Baylor 's tip @-@ in attempt was thwarted by Sam Jones . In overtime , Jones scored several clutch baskets to ensure a 110 – 107 win for the Celtics . The 1962 NBA finals would serve as the beginning of the greatest rivalry in NBA history 
 In the 1962 – 63 NBA season , Baylor was back full @-@ time . West averaged 27 @.@ 8 points , 7 @.@ 0 rebounds and 5 @.@ 6 assists and was again NBA All @-@ Star and All @-@ NBA First @-@ Team ; however , he played in only 55 regular season games , missing the last seven weeks due to a hamstring injury . Again , the Lakers reached the finals , and again , they battled the Celtics . With West not yet in shape , Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3 – 2 ; then they succumbed in Game 6 in front of their home crowd with a 112 – 109 loss . As the game ended , veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into the rafters of the L.A. Sports Arena . 
 In the following 1963 – 64 NBA season , West for the first time became the Lakers ' scoring leader , his 28 @.@ 7 points per game eclipsing the 25 @.@ 4 by Baylor , who stated that he suffered from knee problems . The Lakers struggled during the entire season , winning only 42 games , and were beaten in the first round of the 1964 NBA Playoffs by the Hawks in five games . 
 = = = Leader of the Lakers = = = 
 In the following 1964 – 65 NBA season , West averaged 31 @.@ 0 points ( at the time , a career @-@ high ) , only surpassed by perennial scoring champion Wilt Chamberlain . After ending the regular season with 49 wins , L.A. played the Baltimore Bullets in the first round of the 1965 NBA Playoffs , but then team captain Baylor suffered a career @-@ threatening knee injury . West spectacularly took over Baylor 's leader role , as he scored 49 points and willed the shocked Lakers to the win . In Game 2 , Baltimore was unable to stop the Lakers guard , who scored 52 points , nearly half of L.A. ' s total , in the 118 – 115 win . The Bullets took their two home games , despite West scoring 44 and 48 points respectively , but in the decisive Game 5 in L.A. , the guard helped beat the Bullets with 42 points in a close 117 – 115 win . West averaged 46 @.@ 3 points per game , a figure that is still an NBA record . However , in the 1965 NBA Finals , the Celtics easily beat the short @-@ handed Lakers , 4 – 1 . In Game 1 , which Boston easily won , defensive Celtics guard K. C. Jones kept West to only 26 points , and in Game 2 , West scored 45 points , but Boston still won 129 – 123 . In Game 3 , West scored 49 points , and L.A. finally won a game , but in Games 4 and 5 , the Lakers were beaten by double digits ; in the last quarter of Game 5 , West missed 14 of 15 shots and could not prevent yet another Celtics win . Still , the Lakers guard finished the playoffs with 40 @.@ 6 points per game . 
 In the 1965 – 66 NBA season , West averaged a career @-@ best 31 @.@ 3 points , along with 7 @.@ 1 rebounds and 6 @.@ 1 assists per game . He made an NBA record 840 free throws , and earned yet another pair of All @-@ Star Team and All @-@ NBA First Team nominations . Winning 45 games , the Lakers beat the St. Louis Hawks in a close seven @-@ game series , and yet again met the Boston Celtics in the 1966 NBA Finals . West was assisted by Baylor , who was a self @-@ estimated " 75 percent " of his pre @-@ injury self , The two long @-@ standing rivals split the first six games , with West 's usual scoring dominance countered by Celtics forward John Havlicek , whose size and speed created serious mismatch problems for the Lakers . In Game 7 , West and Baylor shot a combined three of 18 in the first half , and the Lakers fell far behind ; L.A. willed themselves back to a close 95 – 93 with four seconds left , but the Celtics ran the clock out and the Lakers were denied yet again . 
 The following 1966 – 67 NBA season saw West playing only 66 regular @-@ season games due to injury ; his averages fell slightly to 28 @.@ 0 points , 5 @.@ 9 rebounds and 6 @.@ 8 assists per game . The Lakers had a disappointing season , winning only 36 games and getting swept by the San Francisco Warriors in the first round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs . Veteran coach Fred Schaus retired , and Butch Van Breda Kolff took over ; under his reign , the Lakers won 52 games in the 1967 – 68 NBA season in their first year in The Forum . The 52 wins were accumulated despite West playing only 51 regular season games due to injury and scoring 26 @.@ 3 points , the lowest average since his rookie year : after being a First @-@ Teamer for six times en bloc , he only made the All @-@ NBA Second Team . 
 In the 1968 NBA Playoffs , the Lakers beat the Chicago Bulls and the Warriors to set up yet another Lakers @-@ Celtics NBA Finals ; it was considered a match of size versus speed , as the Lakers had nobody to counter Celtics coach / center Bill Russell or forward John Havlicek close to the basket , but the Celtics in return had difficulties guarding prolific L.A. outside shooters Baylor , West and fellow guard Gail Goodrich . In Game 1 , West only hit seven of 24 shots , and the Lakers lost 107 – 101 , but L.A. evened out the series at two games each . But West , who had scored 38 points in a Game 4 win , had sprained his ankle and did not play at full strength the rest of the series . In Game 5 , an injured West scored 35 points , but Boston won by three points . In Game 6 , Havlicek shredded the Lakers with 40 points , and after yet another Celtics loss , West commented that the Lakers lost two games they should have won : " We gave them the first game , and we gave them the fifth . But I take nothing from them … They 're all that way on the Celtics , and you can 't teach it . " 
 = = = Arrival of Wilt Chamberlain = = = 
 On July 9 , 1968 , the Lakers made a trade which brought reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers to Los Angeles at the beginning of the 1968 – 69 NBA season . To get the center , the Lakers traded West 's backcourt partner Archie Clark , starting center Darrall Imhoff and backup forward Jerry Chambers to Philadelphia . Coach Van Breda Kolff was concerned about the drain at the guard positions after losing Clark , and especially after losing Goodrich due to the expansion draft of the Phoenix Suns . He only had diminutive , defensively weak Johnny Egan left next to West . While West himself got on well with the new recruit , Chamberlain often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor and had a poor relationship with Van Breda Kolff . Van Breda Kolff pejoratively called Chamberlain " The Load " , and later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical , never respected him , too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics . In return , the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as " the dumbest and worst coach ever " . There was an altercation in which Chamberlain was about to punch Van Breda Kolff before Baylor had intervened . West was clearly disturbed by locker room tension ; used to playing in teams with good chemistry , his quality of play became erratic , and he posted a career @-@ low 25 @.@ 9 points . However , he made the Second Team of the inaugural All @-@ Defensive Team . 
 In the 1969 NBA Playoffs , the 55 @-@ win Lakers defeated the Atlanta Hawks and the San Francisco Warriors , setting up the sixth finals series versus Boston in eight years . Prior to Game 1 , West privately complained to Bill Russell of exhaustion , but then the Lakers guard scored 53 points on Boston in a close two @-@ point win . L.A. also took Game 2 , with West scoring 41 points . In Game 3 , Russell opted to double @-@ team West , and the guard 's exhaustion began to show : West twice asked to be subbed for longer periods , and both times the Lakers fell back by double digits and finally lost by six points . Game 4 saw Celtics guard Sam Jones hit an off @-@ balance buzzer beater to tie the series , but in Game 5 , the Lakers struck back and won by 13 points ; however , they suffered a major blow when West – who scored 39 points and by far led all players in scoring during the entire series – lunged for a meaningless late @-@ game ball and seriously pulled his hamstring : it was immediately visible that the injury would not heal until the end of the series . A limping West scored 26 points in Game 6 , but the Celtics won 99 – 90 with a strong Bill Russell , who held Chamberlain to only eight points in the entire game . In Game 7 , Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in Los Angeles . This display of arrogance motivated the Celtics and angered West . The Lakers trailed the entire game and were behind 91 @-@ 76 after 3 quarters , but powered by a limping West , the Lakers closed the gap to 103 @-@ 102 with two minutes to go and had the ball . But West committed costly turnovers and L.A. lost the game 108 – 106 despite a triple @-@ double 42 points , 13 rebounds and 12 assists from West , who became the only winner of the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award from the losing team . After the loss , West was seen as the ultimate tragic hero : after the game , Bill Russell held his hand , and John Havlicek said : " I love you , Jerry " . 
 In the 1969 – 70 NBA season under new coach Joe Mullaney , the Lakers ' season began with a shock when Wilt Chamberlain seriously injured his knee and missed practically the whole regular season . As after Baylor 's injury years before , West stepped into the void , leading the NBA in scoring average with 31 @.@ 2 points per game , and averaging 4 @.@ 6 rebounds and 7 @.@ 5 assists per game , earning him his first of four All @-@ Defensive First Team vote and another All @-@ NBA First Team berth after two Second Team years . The Lakers won 46 games , and in the 1970 NBA Playoffs , they narrowly beat the Phoenix Suns in seven games and swept the Hawks in four , setting up the first NBA Finals between the Lakers and the rugged New York Knicks , led by Hall @-@ of @-@ Famers , such as Willis Reed , Dave DeBusschere , Bill Bradley , and Walt Frazier . L.A. and N.Y. split the first two games , with both games respectively decided by centers Reed and the still @-@ hobbling Chamberlain . In Game 3 , DeBusschere hit a mid @-@ range jump shot with three seconds left to put the Knicks ahead 102 – 100 , and the Lakers had no time @-@ outs left . Chamberlain inbounded the ball to West , who raced past Walt Frazier and threw up a 60 @-@ foot shot . Frazier later commented : " The man 's crazy . He looks determined . He thinks it 's really going in ! " West incredibly connected , and this basket was later called one of the greatest moments ever by the NBA . As the three @-@ point line had not been introduced yet , the shot just tied the game . In overtime , West however sprained his left hand and missed all five of his shots , and the Knicks won 111 @-@ 108 . In Game 4 , the guard scored 37 points and 18 assists , and the Lakers won . However , more frustration awaited West in Game 5 , when Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed out for the series ; instead of capitalising on a double @-@ digit lead and reeling off an easy win , the Lakers committed 19 second half turnovers , and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times , respectively , in the entire second half and lost 107 @-@ 100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history . After Chamberlain scored 45 points and West 31 points plus 13 assists in a series @-@ equalising 135 @-@ 113 Lakers win , the Lakers seemed favorites prior to Game 7 . However , West had also injured his right hand and received several manual injections , and Reed famously hobbled up court prior to Game 7 : the Knicks center scored the first four points , and inspired his team to one of the most famous playoff upsets of all time . With his injured hands , West still hit nine of his 19 shots , but was outplayed by Walt Frazier , who scored 36 points and 19 assists and was credited with several crucial steals on Lakers guard Dick Garrett . 
 In the 1970 – 71 NBA season , the Lakers resigned Gail Goodrich , who came back from the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968 . At age 32 , West averaged 27 @.@ 9 points , 4 @.@ 6 rebounds and 9 @.@ 5 assists , and helped the Lakers win 46 games and make the 1971 NBA Playoffs . After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career , West himself injured his knee and was out for the season ; the short @-@ handed Lakers lost the Western Conference Finals in five games to the championship @-@ bound Milwaukee Bucks . The Milwaukee Bucks featured freshly crowned Most Valuable Player Lew Alcindor ( later known as Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar ) and veteran Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame guard Oscar Robertson . 
 = = = Late success and twilight years = = = 
 Prior to the 1971 – 72 NBA season , West was smarting from his frequent injuries and losses and considered retirement . The Lakers hired former Celtics star guard and future Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame coach Bill Sharman as head coach . Although injured captain Elgin Baylor ended his career , the Lakers had a season for the ages : powered by Sharman 's emphasis on tough defense and fast break offense , L.A. embarked on an unprecedented 33 game win streak , en route to a then @-@ record 69 wins in the regular season . West himself contributed with 25 @.@ 8 points and leading the league with a career @-@ high 9 @.@ 7 assists per game , was named All @-@ Star , All @-@ NBA and All @-@ Defense First Teamer and voted 1972 All @-@ Star Game MVP . 
 In the post @-@ season , the Lakers defeated the Chicago Bulls in a four @-@ game sweep , then went on to face the Milwaukee Bucks , and defeated them in six games . In the 1972 NBA Finals , the Lakers again met the New York Knicks . Although West suffered a terrible shooting slump during Games 1 and 2 , the Lakers tied the series at one win each , and in Game 3 , he scored 21 points and helped L.A. win Game 3 . In this game , he now had scored 4 @,@ 002 playoff points , which set an all @-@ time NBA record . After winning Game 4 due to a superb outing from Wilt Chamberlain , West scored 23 points in Game 5 , and he won the game and their first @-@ ever NBA title . West conceded that he had played a terrible series , and credited the team for the success . Years later he said " I played terrible basketball in the Finals , and we won … It was particularly frustrating because I was playing so poorly that the team overcame me . Maybe that 's what a team is all about . " 
 Now having vanquished this long @-@ time bane , West entered his 13th NBA year . In the 1972 – 73 NBA season , the main scoring role was taken by Goodrich , and West was now a playmaker instead of a scorer . However , West averaged 22 @.@ 8 points , but also averaged 8 @.@ 8 assists per game , and again was a First Teamer in the All @-@ Star , All @-@ NBA , and All @-@ Defense Teams . The Lakers won 60 games and reached the 1973 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks . In Game 1 West scored 24 points before fouling out with three minutes left and L.A. won Game 1 with 115 – 112 . However , the Knicks took Games 2 and 3 , and West strained both of his hamstrings : in Game 4 , the shorthanded Lakers were no match for New York , and in Game 5 , the valiant , but injured West and Hairston had miserable games , and despite Chamberlain scoring 23 points and grabbing 21 rebounds , the Lakers lost 102 – 93 and the series . 
 The following 1973 – 74 NBA season was to be West 's last . Now 36 years old , the veteran guard averaged 20 @.@ 3 points , 3 @.@ 7 rebounds and 6 @.@ 6 assists per game . In two newly introduced statistics , steals and blocks , he was credited with 2 @.@ 6 steals and 0 @.@ 7 blocks per game . Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin , West was still regarded as an elite guard , earning another callup into his final All @-@ Star Game . Without Chamberlain , who had ended his NBA career , the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks . After this loss , West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke , and filed a suit for unpaid back wages . West wanted to re @-@ negotiate his contract and keep playing , however he said Cooke " basically told my agent to go to hell . I felt I was deceived . When you feel that you ’ re deceived you don ’ t want any part of the organization that deceived you . I could ’ ve played another very good year . Every athlete says that . But I could ’ ve , and I knew I could ’ ve . But I could never have played for the Lakers again , and I wasn ’ t going to play for anybody else . " At the time of his departure , West had scored more points than any Laker in NBA history .
