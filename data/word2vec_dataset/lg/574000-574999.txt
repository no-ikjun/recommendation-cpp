 Charlie Murder was first announced in January 2010 in a Ska Studios blog post as an Xbox Live Indie Games title set for release in March 2010 . The game 's plot was a four @-@ member band 's journey to save <unk> ( Murder 's girlfriend ) from a rival metal band . A demo of the game was showcased at PAX East 2010 . In April , Ska Studios founder James Silva announced that the game was in development for an unidentified platform and would no longer be released through Xbox Live Indie Games . Joystiq noted that the demo ran on Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4 @.@ 0 , which is designed for the Xbox 360 , Microsoft Windows computers , and Windows Phone 7 . Ska Studios announced in May that the game was to undergo a " complete overhaul " , and would be released through Xbox Live Arcade in 2012 . The game was eventually released in August 2013 as part of Summer of Arcade , an annual Xbox Live Arcade promotion known for releasing several of the platform 's most acclaimed games . 
 Ska Studios ' first games , including the Xbox Live Arcade game The Dishwasher : Dead Samurai ( April 2009 ) , were developed entirely by James Silva . Michelle Juett was a tester for The Dishwasher : Dead Samurai , and the two met in person for the first time at the September 2009 Penny Arcade Expo . They began to date a year later , and Juett eventually left <unk> to join Ska Studios , becoming its second employee . Charlie Murder was one of the first games that the two worked on together . Silva did all of the game 's programming work , while Juett handled its marketing . Silva and Juett worked together to design the art and compose the soundtrack . Charlie Murder 's music was produced by Silva and sung by the pair . In an interview with Joystiq , James Silva explained that he used major game conferences , such as PAX East , as public betas . The conferences allowed Silva to expose a large number of people to the game , providing him with the opportunity to solicit feedback and discover issues . The couple also invited friends over for parties in order to test the game while it was in development . Silva proposed to Juett at the Charlie Murder booth at PAX 2011 , using an in @-@ game cutscene built in secret for the occasion . 
 Charlie Murder was the third Ska Studios game published by Microsoft Studios . During development , Microsoft Studios provided Ska Studios with usability testing and play testing feedback , handled localization , and found and suggested bug fixes . Microsoft required Ska Studios to create picture packs ( Xbox Live account customizations ) , but was not responsible for the Windows Phone 8 game mechanic . Ska Studios had complete creative control over the game itself . Charlie Murder was promoted as a free Xbox download with Microsoft 's Games with Gold program during the month of June 2014 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Charlie Murder received " generally favorable " reviews , according to video game review aggregator Metacritic . The game 's music was highly praised . The game 's hand @-@ illustrated visuals were also praised by reviewers . Critics felt that the music and visual style complemented the game 's punk rock theme , and Official Xbox Magazine 's Cameron Lewis praised the game for being rich in personality and detail without being over @-@ polished . 
 Reviewers were less enthused about the game 's user interface , and found that many gameplay details went unexplained . IGN 's Jose Otero found the inventory management system , which lacks an easy way to sort items , to be problematic . Chris Carter from Destructoid noted that the game 's intricacies are described in messages on the in @-@ game phone , which he considered difficult to navigate and read , and that the messages were often insufficiently clear and detailed . 
 Critics compared the game to Ska Studios ' previous side @-@ scrolling beat ' em up games , The Dishwasher : Dead Samurai and The Dishwasher : Vampire Smile . Game Informer noted Charlie Murder 's similarity to the Dishwasher series , and Destructoid 's Chris Carter believed that Charlie Murder was an improvement over the previous games , in both presentation and in the amount of personality that the characters had . There was a consensus among reviewers that the game was more enjoyable in multiplayer , with Hardcore Gamer saying that the game felt designed for cooperative play . 
 = Storm Coaster = 
 Storm Coaster is a Water Coaster located at the Sea World theme park on the Gold Coast , Australia . The ride is designed by German firm Mack Rides and combines the flume and splashdown elements of a log flume , with the chain lift hill and drops of a steel roller coaster . 
 Original plans for a Water Coaster at Sea World were released by the local council in 2008 ; however , they were put on hold . In 2010 , the Bermuda Triangle ride closed , sitting dormant until mid @-@ 2012 when construction for the Storm Coaster began . After demolition works were completed , track for the Storm Coaster arrived at Sea World , taking five months to erect . Storm Coaster officially opened to the public on 6 December 2013 . 
 Storm Coaster is themed to the effects of a Category 5 Tropical Cyclone at a coastal shipping port . The 470 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 1 @,@ 540 ft ) ride stands 28 metres ( 92 ft ) tall and features a top speed of 70 kilometres per hour ( 43 mph ) . The ride has been well received , with praise for it being both fun and thrilling .

 In January 2008 , the Gold Coast City Council released plans for a Mack Rides Water Coaster at Sea World . The ride would have been located at the front of the park , with the ride 's station situated where the Penguin Encounter exhibit exists and the main track extending out and over the car park . These plans were shelved . In December 2008 , Sea World opened Jet Rescue , an Intamin <unk> Coaster . 
 In June 2012 , Sea World applied for a permit to demolish the Bermuda Triangle water ride system and the interior of its show building . The Bermuda Triangle had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction . On 12 July 2012 , Christian von <unk> from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013 ; leading to speculation that Sea World might have revived its plans . Further development application filings , and reports by the Roller Coaster <unk> and the Gold Coast Bulletin , confirmed this speculation . In September 2012 , Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides ( DyMoRides ) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet @-@ to @-@ be @-@ announced Storm Coaster . DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013 . DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction , Full @-@ On Lighting for lighting design , Volume One for audio and visual effects , and Sculpt Studios for theming design . 
 Prior to the commencement of construction , Sea World announced a new attraction for 2013 and released a promotional image on their Facebook page which read " The storm is building . It 's gonna be a big one . " . Demolition works began in August 2012 . Due to this construction , nearby attractions , including Viking 's Revenge Flume Ride , Jet Rescue and the Skyway , were intermittently closed throughout the latter part of 2012 and into 2013 . The first pieces of ride track arrived on site in April 2013 , with vertical construction commencing in the following month . An official announcement for Storm Coaster made by Sea World in May 2013 detailed the ride would feature 470 metres ( 1 @,@ 540 ft ) of track and a series of water and fire effects . Although an opening date of September 2013 was initially set , Sea World later revised this to be Summer 2013 . By September 2013 , the ride 's track was complete , with focus moving towards theming and testing the ride . On 2 December 2013 , Storm Coaster soft opened to the public , with an official opening held four days later .

 Storm Coaster is a Water Coaster designed by Mack Rides . The 470 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 1 @,@ 540 ft ) track layout is identical to <unk> at <unk> <unk> in Denmark . The ride stands 28 metres ( 92 ft ) tall and features a top speed of 70 kilometres per hour ( 43 mph ) . Unlike most roller coasters which have two rails and a wheel assembly to wrap around the track , Storm Coaster features six rails where the wheels run within the track . The ride features six Coast Guard @-@ themed vehicles that each seat eight riders in four rows of two . Riders are restrained through the use of both lap bars and seat belts . Storm Coaster is reported to have cost $ 20 million , making it the single biggest investment in an Australian theme park attraction .

 Storm Coaster is themed around the effects of a Category 5 Tropical Cyclone at a coastal shipping port . Theming surrounding the ride depicts a path of destruction from the storm , with boats , cars , shipping containers and other debris strewn throughout . However , the port is in the eye of the storm and everyone must evacuate via Coast Guard rescue boats . 
 Riders enter the queue area by passing through a shipping container with a rusty Storm Coaster sign on it . A short outdoor path leads riders towards a stack of containers . Riders enter the containers through a series of black rubber flaps , before emerging into a warehouse . Once at the station riders board one of the Coast Guard boats . 
 After departing the station , the boats travel through a short flume section before emerging from the building and ascending a 28 @-@ metre @-@ tall ( 92 ft ) chain lift hill . Once at the top of the hill , the track dips and turns 180 degrees to the right , entering a mid @-@ course brake run . A sweeping 180 degree downward turn to the right is followed by an upward turn into another brake run . The ride then drops below ground , passing under the queue path before emerging over an air @-@ time hill , where riders experience a feeling of weightlessness . This hill drops into the hull of an upturned boat and is followed by the ride 's splashdown . On the boat 's return path to the station it passes a variety of lighting , fire , and water effects . Riders exiting Storm Coaster pass alongside the ride 's finale , with the chance to get soaked by other boats in the splashdown area .

 The reception of Storm Coaster has been positive . Shaya Laughlin of the Gold Coast Bulletin described the air @-@ time hill and indoor splashdown as more thrilling than the rest of the ride . Laughlin concluded that the " Storm Coaster was definitely worth every cent Sea World spent " . Michelle Tapper of Seven News stated the ride was " really fun , but not as scary as [ she ] thought it would be " . Tapper suggested riders might want a spare change of clothes due to the extent of the final splashdown . 
 = Western Ganga dynasty = 
 Western Ganga was an important ruling dynasty of ancient Karnataka in India which lasted from about 350 to 1000 AD . They are known as ' Western Gangas ' to distinguish them from the Eastern Gangas who in later centuries ruled over Kalinga ( modern Odisha ) . The general belief is that the Western Gangas began their rule during a time when multiple native clans asserted their freedom due to the weakening of the Pallava empire in South India , a geo @-@ political event sometimes attributed to the southern conquests of Samudra Gupta . The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 AD , initially ruling from Kolar and later , moving their capital to <unk> on the banks of the Kaveri River in modern Mysore district . 
 After the rise of the imperial Chalukyas of Badami , the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the cause of their overlords against the Pallavas of Kanchi . The Chalukyas were replaced by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta in 753 AD as the dominant power in the Deccan . After a century of struggle for autonomy , the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes , the Chola Dynasty of Tanjavur . In the late 10th century , north of Tungabhadra river , the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the Kaveri river . The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region . 
 Though territorially a small kingdom , the Western Ganga contribution to polity , culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered important . The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage toward Jainism resulting in the construction of monuments in places such as Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli . The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flourished . Chavundaraya 's writing , Chavundaraya Purana of 978 AD , is an important work in Kannada prose . Many classics were written on various subjects ranging from religion to elephant management . 
 = = History = = 
 Multiple theories have been proposed regarding the ancestry of the founders of the Western Ganga dynasty ( prior to the 4th century ) . Some mythical accounts point to a northern origin , while theories based on epigraphy suggest a southern origin . Historians who propose the southern origin have further debated whether the early petty chieftains of the clan ( prior to their rise to power ) were natives of the southern districts of modern Karnataka , the Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu or of the southern districts of modern Andhra Pradesh . These regions encompass an area of the southern Deccan where the three modern states merge geographically . It is theorised that the Gangas may have taken advantage of the confusion caused by the invasion of southern India by the northern king Samudra Gupta prior to 350 , and carved out a kingdom for themselves . The area they controlled was called Gangavadi and included regions of the modern districts of Mysore , Hassan <unk> , Tumkur , Kolar , Mandya and Bangalore in Karnataka state . At times , they also controlled some areas in modern Tamil Nadu ( Kongu region starting from the 6th century rule of King Avinita ) and Andhra Pradesh ( <unk> region starting from the middle of the 5th century ) . The founding king of the dynasty was <unk> Madhava who made Kolar his capital around 350 and ruled for about twenty years . 
 By the time of Harivarma in 390 , the Gangas had consolidated their kingdom with Talakad as their capital . Their move from the early capital Kolar may have been a strategic one with the intention of containing the growing Kadamba power . By 430 they had consolidated their eastern territories comprising modern Bangalore , Kolar and Tumkur districts and by 470 they had gained control over Kongu region in modern Tamil Nadu , <unk> ( modern Chikkamagaluru and Belur ) , <unk> and <unk> regions ( comprising modern <unk> and Nanjangud ) in modern Karnataka . In 529 , King Durvinita ascended the throne after waging a war with his younger brother who was favoured by his father , King Avinita . Some accounts suggest that in this power struggle , the Pallavas of Kanchi supported Avinita 's choice of heir and the Badami Chalukya King Vijayaditya supported his father @-@ in @-@ law , Durvinita . From the inscriptions it is known that these battles were fought in Tondaimandalam and Kongu regions ( northern Tamil Nadu ) prompting historians to suggest that Durvinita fought the Pallavas successfully . Considered the most successful of the Ganga kings , Durvinita was well versed in arts such as music , dance , ayurveda and taming wild elephants . Some inscriptions sing paeans to him by comparing him to Yudhishthira and Manu – figures from Hindu mythology known for their wisdom and fairness . 
 Politically , the Gangas were feudatories and close allies who also shared matrimonial relations with the Chalukyas . This is attested by inscriptions which describe their joint campaigns against their arch enemy , the Pallavas of Kanchi . From the year 725 onwards , the Gangavadi territories came to be called as the " Gangavadi @-@ <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> Vishaya ) comprising the eastern and western provinces of modern south Karnataka . King <unk> fought the Pallava King Nandivarman <unk> successfully , bringing <unk> in north Arcot under his control temporarily for which he earned the title <unk> . A contest with the Pandyas of Madurai over control of Kongu region ended in a Ganga defeat , but a matrimony between a Ganga princess and <unk> Pandya 's son brought peace helping the Gangas retain control over the contested region . 
 In 753 , when the Rashtrakutas replaced the Badami Chalukyas as the dominant force in the Deccan , the Gangas offered stiff resistance for about a century . King Shivamara II is mostly known for his wars with the Rashtrakuta Dhruva Dharavarsha , his subsequent defeat and imprisonment , his release from prison and eventually his death on the battle field . The Ganga resistance continued through the reign of Rashtrakuta Govinda III and by 819 , a Ganga resurgence gained them partial control over Gangavadi under King <unk> . Seeing the futility of waging war with the Western Ganga , Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I gave his daughter <unk> in marriage to Ganga prince Butuga I , son of King Ereganga <unk> . The Gangas thereafter became staunch allies of the Rashtrakutas , a position they maintained till the end of the Rashtrakuta dynasty of Manyakheta . 
 After an uneventful period , Butuga II ascended the throne in 938 with the help of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha III ( whose daughter he married ) . He helped the Rashtrakutas win decisive victories in Tamilakam in the battle of <unk> against the Chola Dynasty . With this victory , the Rashtrakutas took control of modern northern Tamil Nadu . In return for their valour , the Gangas were awarded extensive territories in the Tungabhadra river valley . King <unk> II who came to power in 963 aided the Rashtrakutas in victories against the Gurjara Pratihara King Lalla and the Paramara kings of Malwa in Central India . Chavundaraya , a minister in the Western Ganga court was a valiant commander , able administrator and an accomplished poet in Kannada and Sanskrit . He served King <unk> II and his successors ably and helped King <unk> IV suppress a civil war in 975 . Towards the end of the 10th century , the Rashtrakutas had been supplanted by the Western Chalukya Empire in Manyakheta . In the south , the Chola Dynasty who were seeing a resurgence of power under Rajaraja Chola I conquered Gangavadi around the year 1000 , bringing the Western Ganga dynasty to an end . Thereafter , large areas of south Karnataka region came under Chola control for about a century . 
 = = Administration = = 
 The Western Ganga administration was influenced by principles stated in the ancient text <unk> . The <unk> gavundas mentioned in the Ganga records held responsibilities similar to those of the village elders ( <unk> ) mentioned by Kautilya . Succession to the throne was hereditary but there were instances when this was overlooked . The kingdom was divided into Rashtra ( district ) and further into <unk> ( consisting of possibly 1000 villages ) and Desa . From the 8th century , the Sanskrit term <unk> was replaced by the Kannada term Nadu . Examples of this change are <unk> @-@ 8000 and <unk> @-@ 6000 , with scholars differing about the significance of the numerical suffix . They opine that it was either the revenue yield of the division computed in cash terms or the number of fighting men in that division or the number of revenue paying hamlets in that division or the number of villages included in that territory . 
 Inscriptions have revealed several important administrative designations such as prime minister ( <unk> ) , treasurer ( <unk> ) , foreign minister ( <unk> ) and chief minister ( <unk> ) . All of these positions came with an additional title of commander ( <unk> ) . Other designations were royal steward ( <unk> ) , master of robes ( <unk> ) , commander of elephant corps ( <unk> ) , commander of cavalry ( <unk> ) etc . In the royal house , <unk> oversaw palace administration , royal clothing and jewellery etc. and the <unk> were responsible for court ceremonies including door keeping and protocol . 
 Officials at the local level were the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , prabhu and gavunda . The <unk> were superintendents from all social classes such as artisans , gold smiths , black smiths etc . The <unk> dealing with the royal household were called <unk> ( house superintendent ) and those who collected tolls were called <unk> <unk> . The <unk> were accountants and tax collectors at the Nadu level and sometimes functioned as scribes . The <unk> were officers who organized and maintained defence at the Nadu level . The prabhu constituted a group of elite people drawn together to witness land grants and demarcation of land boundaries . The gavundas who appear most often in inscriptions were the backbone of medieval polity of the southern Karnataka region . They were landlords and local elite whom the state utilized their services to collect taxes , maintain records of landownership , bear witness to grants and transactions and even raise militia when required . 
 Inscriptions that specify land grants , rights and ownership were descriptive of the boundaries of demarcation using natural features such as rivers , streams , water channels , hillocks , large boulders , layout of the village , location of forts ( <unk> ) if any in the proximity , irrigation canals , temples , tanks and even shrubs and large trees . Also included was the type of soil , the crops meant to be grown and tanks or wells to be excavated for irrigation . Inscriptions mention wet land , cultivable land , forest and waste land . There are numerous references to hamlets ( palli ) belonging to the hunter communities who resided in them ( <unk> ) . From the 6th century onwards , the inscriptions refer to feudal lords by the title <unk> . The <unk> were either brahmins or from tribal background who controlled hereditary territories paying periodic tribute to the king . The <unk> who were loyal bodyguards of the royalty were fierce warriors under oath ( <unk> ) . They moved with the royal family and were expected to fight for the master and be willing to lay down their lives in the process . If the king died , the <unk> were required to self immolate on the funeral pyre of the master . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The Gangavadi region consisted of the malnad region , the plains ( <unk> ) and the semi @-@ malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills . The main crops of the malnad region were paddy , betel leaves , cardamom and pepper and the semi @-@ malnad region with its lower altitude produced rice , millets such as ragi and corn , pulses , oilseeds and it was also the base for cattle farming . The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by Kaveri , Tungabhadra and Vedavati rivers where cultivations of sugarcane , paddy , coconut , areca nut ( <unk> <unk> ) , betel leaves , plantain and flowers ( vara vana ) were common . Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks , wells , natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams ( Katta ) . Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community . 
 Soil types mentioned in records are black soil ( <unk> ) in the Sinda @-@ 8000 territory and to red soil ( <unk> <unk> ) Cultivated land was of three types ; wet land , dry land and to a lesser extent garden land with paddy being the dominant crop of the region . Wet lands were called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> and was specifically used to denote paddy land requiring standing water . The fact that pastoral economies were spread throughout Gangavadi region comes from references to cowherds in many inscriptions . The terms <unk> ( a thousand cows ) , <unk> ( owner of cows ) , <unk> ( donor of cows ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( protector of cows ) attest to this . Inscriptions indicate ownership of cows may have been as important as cultivable land and that there may have existed a social hierarchy based on this . Inscriptions mention cattle raids attesting to the importance of the pastoral economy , destructive raids , assaults on women ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , abduction of women by <unk> ( hunter tribes ) ; all of which indicate the existing militarism of the age . 
 Lands that were exempt from taxes were called <unk> and sometimes consisted of several villages . They were granted by local chieftains without any reference to the overlord , indicating a de @-@ centralised economy . These lands , often given to heroes who perished in the line of duty were called <unk> or <unk> . When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration , it was called <unk> . Some types of taxes on income were kara or <unk> ( internal taxes ) , <unk> ( gifts due to the king ) , <unk> ( cash payments ) and <unk> ( tolls and duties on imported items ) . Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land ; even if the land was not actually cultivated . 
 <unk> was a local tax levied on agriculture and <unk> was a tax levied on merchandise by the local feudal ruler . Based on context , <unk> also meant 1 / 10 , <unk> meant 1 / 5 and <unk> meant 1 / 7 . <unk> literally meant land tax and was levied together with shepherds tax ( <unk> ) payable to the chief of shepherds . Bhaga meant a portion or share of the produce from land or the land area itself . Minor taxes such as <unk> ( due to the landlords ) and <unk> ( raised by the army officers or <unk> ) are mentioned . In addition to taxes for maintenance of the local officer 's retinue , villages were obligated to feed armies on the march to and from battles . <unk> or <unk> taxes comprised usually of a percentage of the produce and was collected for constructing irrigation tanks .

 The Western Gangas gave patronage to all the major religions of the time ; Jainism and the Hindu sects of Shaivism , Vedic Brahminism and Vaishnavism . However scholars have argued that not all Gangas kings may have given equal priority to all the faiths . Some historians believe that the Gangas were ardent Jains . However , inscriptions contradict this by providing references to <unk> ( staunch Shaiva ascetics ) , <unk> and <unk> ( followers of <unk> doctrine ) who flourished in Gangavadi , indicating that Shaivism was also popular . King Madhava and Harivarma were devoted to cows and brahmins , King <unk> was a devout Vaishnava , Madhava III 's and Avinita 's inscriptions describe lavish endowments to Jain orders and temples and King Durvinita performed Vedic sacrifices prompting historians to claim he was a Hindu . 
 Jainism became popular in the dynasty in the 8th century when the ruler King Shivamara I constructed numerous Jain basadis . King Butuga II and minister Chavundaraya were staunch Jains which is evident from the construction of the <unk> monolith . Jains worshipped the twenty four tirthankars ( <unk> ) whose images were consecrated in their temples . The worship of the footprint of spiritual leaders such as those of Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola from the 10th century is considered a parallel to Buddhism . Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of Bahubali , the son of Tirthankar <unk> ( just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva ) . The worship of subordinate deities such as <unk> and <unk> , earlier considered as mere attendants of the tirthankars was seen from the 7th century to the 12th century . 
 Vedic Brahminism was popular in the 6th and 7th centuries when inscriptions refer to grants made to <unk> Brahmins . These inscriptions also describe the gotra ( lineage ) affiliation to royal families and their adherence of such Vedic rituals as <unk> ( horse sacrifice ) and <unk> . Brahmins and kings enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship ; rituals performed by the brahmins gave legitimacy to kings and the land grants made by kings to brahmins elevated them in society to the level of wealthy landowners . Vaishnavism however maintained a low profile and not many inscriptions describe grants towards its cause . Some Vaishnava temples were built by the Gangas such as the <unk> temples at Nanjangud , Sattur and <unk> in modern Mysore district . The deity Vishnu was depicted with four arms holding a conch ( <unk> ) , discus ( <unk> ) , mace ( gada ) and lotus ( padma ) . 
 From the beginning of the 8th century , patronage to Shaivism increased in every section of the society ; the landed elite , landlords , assemblies ( samaya ) , schools of learning ( <unk> ) and minor ruling families such as the Bana , <unk> and Chalukya clans . The Shaiva temples contained a Shiva linga ( phallus ) in the sanctum sanctorum along with images of the mother goddess , Surya ( Sun god ) and Nandi ( a bull and attendant of Shiva ) which was normally enshrined in a separate pavilion facing the sanctum . The linga was man made and in some cases had etchings of Ganapati ( son of Shiva ) and Parvati ( consort and wife of Shiva ) on it . Due to the vigorous efforts of priests and ascetics , Shaiva monastic orders flourished in many places such as Nandi Hills , Avani and <unk> in modern Kolar district . 
 = = = Society = = = 
 The Western Ganga society in many ways reflected the emerging religious , political and cultural developments of those times . Women became active in local administration because Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to their queens such as the feudal queen <unk> @-@ <unk> of <unk> and the queens of King <unk> , Butuga II and feudal king <unk> . Inheritance of fiscal and administrative responsibility by the son @-@ in @-@ law , the wife or by the daughter is evident . The position of prime minister of King Ereganga II and position of <unk> ( local landlord ) bestowed upon <unk> , the wife of a fallen hero are examples . When <unk> took to asceticism , her daughter inherited the position . 
 The devadasi system ( <unk> or courtesan ) in temples was prevalent and was modelled after the structures in the royal palace . Contemporaneous literature such a <unk> makes a mention of the chief queen ( Dharani Mahadevi ) accompanied by lower ranking queens ( <unk> ) and courtesans of the women 's royal quarter ( <unk> <unk> ) . Some of the courtesans and concubines employed in the harem of the kings and chieftains were well respected , examples being <unk> at whose instance a local chief made land grant to a Jain temple . Education in the royal family was closely supervised and included such subjects as political science , elephant and horse riding , archery , medicine , poetry , grammar , drama , literature , dance , singing and use of musical instruments . Brahmins enjoyed an influential position in society and were exempt from certain taxes and customs due on land . In turn they managed public affairs such as teaching , local judiciary , functioned as trustees and bankers , managed schools , temples , irrigation tanks , rest houses , collected taxes due from villages and raised money from public subscriptions . 
 By virtue of a Hindu belief that killing of a brahmin ( <unk> ) was a sin , capital punishment was not applicable to them . Upper caste <unk> ( <unk> ) were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the caste system . Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand . Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu caste system ; three among kshatriya , three among brahmin , two among <unk> and two among <unk> . Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home , land , grain , money etc. if there were no male heirs . If no claimants to the property existed , the state took possession of these properties as <unk> ( charitable asset ) . Intercaste marriage , child marriage , marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter , <unk> marriage ( where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants ) were all in vogue . Memorials containing hero stones ( <unk> ) were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial . 
 The presence of numerous <unk> ( or <unk> – hero stones for a woman who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband ) indicates the popularity of Sati among royalty . Ritual death by sallekhana and by <unk> ( drowning in water ) were also practiced . Popular clothing among men was the use of two unrestricted garments , a Dhoti as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment while women wore Saris with stitched petticoats . Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and people used umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds . Ornaments were popular among men and women and even elephants and horses were decorated . Men wore finger rings , necklaces ( <unk> and <unk> sara ) , bracelets ( <unk> ) and wristlets ( <unk> ) . Women wore a nose jewel ( <unk> ) , nose ring ( <unk> ) , bangles ( bale or <unk> ) and various types of necklaces ( <unk> <unk> sara and <unk> sutra ) . During leisure , men amused themselves with horse riding , watching wrestling bouts , cock fights and ram fights . There existed a large and well organised network of schools for imparting higher education and these schools were known by various names such as agraharas , <unk> , <unk> or matha . Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at <unk> , Balligavi , Talagunda , Aihole , Arasikere and other places . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 The Western Ganga rule was a period of brisk literary activity in Sanskrit and Kannada , though many of the writings are now considered extinct and are known only from references made to them . Chavundaraya 's writing , Chavundaraya Purana ( or <unk> <unk> ) of 978 CE , is an early existing work in prose style in Kannada and contains a summary of the Sanskrit writings , Adipurana and <unk> which were written a century earlier by Jinasena and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I. The prose , composed in lucid Kannada , was mainly meant for the common man and avoided any reference to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy . His writings seem to be influenced by the writings of his predecessor Adikavi Pampa and contemporary Ranna . The work narrates the legends of a total of 63 Jain proponents including twenty @-@ four Jain Tirthankar , twelve <unk> , nine <unk> , nine <unk> and nine <unk> . 
 The earliest postulated Kannada writer from this dynasty is King Durvinita of the 6th century . Kavirajamarga of 850 CE , refers to a Durvinita as an early writer of Kannada prose . Around 900 CE , Gunavarma I authored the Kannada works , Sudraka and Harivamsa . His writings are considered extinct but references to these writings are found in later years . He is known to have been patronised by King Ereganga <unk> II . In Sudraka , he has favourably compared his patron to King Sudraka of ancient times . The great Kannada poet Ranna was patronised by Chavundaraya in his early literary days . Ranna 's classic Parashurama <unk> is considered a eulogy of his patron who held such titles as Samara Parashurama . 
 Nagavarma I , a brahmin scholar who came from Vengi in modern Andhra Pradesh ( late 10th century ) was also patronised by Chavundaraya . He wrote <unk> ( ocean of prosody ) addressed to his wife . This is considered the earliest available Kannada writing in prosody . He also wrote one of the earliest available romance classics in Kannada called Karnataka Kadambari in sweet and flowing champu ( mixed verse and prose ) style . It is based on an earlier romantic work in Sanskrit by poet Bana and is popular among critics . <unk> ( hundred verses on elephants ) , a rare Kannada work on elephant management was written by King Shivamara II around 800 CE but this work is now considered extinct . Other writers such as <unk> and <unk> were known to be popular in the 10th century . 
 In an age of classical Sanskrit literature , Madhava II ( brother of King <unk> ) wrote a treatise <unk> <unk> which was based on an earlier work on erotics by a writer called <unk> . A Sanskrit version of <unk> , a commentary on Pāṇini 's grammar called <unk> and a commentary on the 15th chapter of a Sanskrit work called <unk> by poet <unk> ( who was in Durvinita 's court ) are ascribed to Durvinita . King Shivamara II is known to have written <unk> Kalpana . <unk> , also known as Vidya <unk> authored <unk> , a narration of the stories of Rama and the Pandavas simultaneously through puns . <unk> and <unk> which were based on poet Bana 's work Kadambari were written by <unk> 's pupil <unk> in prose <unk> and Chavundaraya wrote <unk> . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 The Western Ganga style of architecture was influenced by the Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features , in addition to indigenous Jain features . The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar on its head , the stepped Vimana of the shrine with horizontal mouldings and square pillars were features inherited from the Pallavas . These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates , the Banas and <unk> . 
 The monolith of Gomateshwara commissioned by Chavundaraya is considered the high point of the Ganga sculptural contribution in ancient Karnataka . Carved from fine @-@ grained white granite , the image stands on a lotus . It has no support up to the thighs and is 60 feet ( 18 m ) tall with the face measuring 6 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) . With the serene expression on the face of the image , its curled hair with graceful locks , its proportional anatomy , the monolith size , and the combination of its artistry and craftsmanship have led it to be called the mightiest achievement in sculptural art in medieval Karnataka . It is the largest monolithic statue in the world . Their free standing pillars called <unk> or <unk> are also considered unique , examples of which are the Brahmadeva pillar and <unk> Brahmadeva Pillar . At the top of the pillar whose shaft ( cylindrical or octagonal ) is decorated with creepers and other floral motifs is the seated Brahma and the base of the pillar normally has engravings of important Jain personalities and inscriptions . 
 Other important contributions are the Jain basadis ' whose towers have gradually receding stories ( <unk> ) ornamented with small models of temples . These tiny shrines have in them engravings of tirthankars ( Jain saints ) . <unk> windows connect the shrines and decorative Kirtimukha ( demon faces ) are used at the top . The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century , Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of Gomateshwara of 982 are the most important monuments at Shravanabelagola . Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor <unk> in the 12th century . The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King Chandragupta Maurya are known to be his creation . The <unk> <unk> at Kambadahalli ( five towered Jan temple ) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is an excellent example of Dravidian art . The wall niches here are surmounted by torana ( lintel ) with carvings of floral motifs , flying divine creatures ( gandharva ) and imaginary monsters ( makara ) ridden by <unk> ( attendants of saints ) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves . 
 The Gangas built many Hindu temples with impressive Dravidian gopuras containing stucco figures from the Hindu pantheon , decorated pierced screen windows which are featured in the mantapa ( hall ) along with <unk> carvings ( seven heavenly mothers ) . Some well known examples are the <unk> Temple at Hole <unk> , <unk> temple at Manne , <unk> temple at Kolar , Rameshvara temple at <unk> , <unk> temple at <unk> and the Kallesvara temple at <unk> . At Talakad they built the <unk> temple , the <unk> temple and the <unk> temple . Unlike the Jain temples where floral frieze decoration is common , Hindu temples were distinguished by friezes ( slab of stone with decorative sculptures ) illustrating episodes from the epics and puranas . Another unique legacy of the Gangas are the number of virgal ( hero stones ) they have left behind ; memorials containing sculptural details in relief of war scenes , Hindu deities , <unk> , Jain tirthankars and ritual death ( such as the <unk> hero stone ) . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 The Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit extensively as their language of administration . Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages . In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths , genealogies , titles of Kings and benedictions tended to be in Sanskrit , while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted , its boundaries , participation of local authorities , rights and obligations of the grantee , taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language . The usage of these two languages showed important changes over the centuries . During the first phase ( 350 – 725 ) , Sanskrit copper plates dominated , indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration and the fact that majority of the records from this phase were <unk> grants ( grants to Brahmin temples ) . In the second phase ( 725 – 1000 ) , lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates , consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith . Recent excavations at <unk> near Mysore have revealed a set of early copper plate bilingual inscriptions dated 444 . The genealogy of the kings of the dynasty is described in Sanskrit while Kannada was used to describe the boundary of the village . An interesting inscription discovered at <unk> near modern Bangalore that deserves mention is the epigraph dated 890 that refers to a Bengaluru war . This is in Hale Kannada ( old Kannada ) language and is the earliest mention of the name of Bangalore city . The Western Gangas minted coins with Kannada and Nagari legends , the most common feature on their coins was the image of an elephant on the obverse and floral petal symbols on the reverse . The Kannada legend <unk> , a royal umbrella or a conch shell appeared on top of the elephant image . The denominations are the pagoda ( weighing 52 grains ) , the <unk> weighting one tenth or one half of the pagoda and the quarter <unk> .

 = Avery – MacLeod – McCarty experiment = 
 The Avery – MacLeod – McCarty experiment was an experimental demonstration , reported in 1944 by Oswald Avery , Colin MacLeod , and Maclyn McCarty , that DNA is the substance that causes bacterial transformation , in an era when it had been widely believed that it was proteins that served the function of carrying genetic information ( with the very word protein itself coined to indicate a belief that its function was primary ) . It was the culmination of research in the 1930s and early 1940s at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research to purify and characterize the " transforming principle " responsible for the transformation phenomenon first described in Griffith 's experiment of 1928 : killed Streptococcus pneumoniae of the virulent strain type III @-@ S , when injected along with living but non @-@ virulent type II @-@ R <unk> , resulted in a deadly infection of type III @-@ S <unk> . In their paper " Studies on the Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing Transformation of <unk> Types : Induction of Transformation by a <unk> Acid Fraction Isolated from Pneumococcus Type III " , published in the February 1944 issue of the Journal of Experimental Medicine , Avery and his colleagues suggest that DNA , rather than protein as widely believed at the time , may be the hereditary material of bacteria , and could be analogous to genes and / or viruses in higher organisms . 
 = = Background = = 
 With the development of serological typing , medical researchers were able to sort bacteria into different strains , or types . When a person or test animal ( e.g. , a mouse ) is inoculated with a particular type , an immune response ensues , generating antibodies that react specifically with antigens on the bacteria . Blood serum containing the antibodies can then be extracted and applied to cultured bacteria . The antibodies will react with other bacteria of the same type as the original inoculation . Fred Neufeld , a German bacteriologist , had discovered the pneumococcal types and serological typing ; until Frederick Griffith 's studies <unk> believed that the types were fixed and unchangeable from one generation to the next . 
 Griffith 's experiment , reported in 1928 , identified that some " transforming principle " in pneumococcal bacteria could transform them from one type to another . Griffith , a British medical officer , had spent years applying serological typing to cases of pneumonia , a frequently fatal disease in the early 20th century . He found that multiple types — some virulent and some non @-@ virulent — were often present over the course of a clinical case of pneumonia , and thought that one type might change into another ( rather than simply multiple types being present all along ) . In testing that possibility , he found that transformation could occur when dead bacteria of a virulent type and live bacteria of a non @-@ virulent type were both injected in mice : the mice would develop a fatal infection ( normally only caused by live bacteria of the virulent type ) and die , and virulent bacteria could be isolated from such infected mice . 
 The findings of Griffith 's experiment were soon confirmed , first by Fred Neufeld at the Koch Institute and by Martin Henry Dawson at the Rockefeller Institute . A series of Rockefeller Institute researchers continued to study transformation in the years that followed . With Richard H.P. Sia , Dawson developed a method of transforming bacteria in vitro ( rather than in vivo as Griffith had done ) . After Dawson 's departure in 1930 , James Alloway took up the attempt to extend Griffith 's findings , resulting in the extraction of aqueous solutions of the transforming principle by 1933 . Colin MacLeod worked to purify such solutions from 1934 to 1937 , and the work was continued in 1940 and completed by Maclyn McCarty . 
 = = Experimental work = = 
 Pneumococcus is characterized by smooth colonies and has a polysaccharide capsule that induces antibody formation ; the different types are classified according to their immunological specificity . 
 The purification procedure Avery undertook consisted of first killing the bacteria with heat and extracting the saline @-@ soluble components . Next , the protein was precipitated out using chloroform and the polysaccharide capsules were hydrolyzed with an enzyme . An immunological precipitation caused by type @-@ specific antibodies was used to verify the complete destruction of the capsules . Then , the active portion was precipitated out by alcohol fractionation , resulting in fibrous strands that could be removed with a stirring rod . 
 Chemical analysis showed that the proportions of carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , and phosphorus in this active portion were consistent with the chemical composition of DNA . To show that it was DNA rather than some small amount of RNA , protein , or some other cell component that was responsible for transformation , Avery and his colleagues used a number of biochemical tests . They found that trypsin , chymotrypsin and ribonuclease ( enzymes that break apart proteins or RNA ) did not affect it , but an enzyme preparation of " <unk> " ( a crude preparation , obtainable from a number of animal sources , that could break down DNA ) destroyed the extract 's transforming power . 
 Follow @-@ up work in response to criticism and challenges included the purification and crystallization , by Moses Kunitz in 1948 , of a DNA <unk> ( <unk> I ) , and precise work by Rollin Hotchkiss showing that virtually all the detected nitrogen in the purified DNA came from glycine , a breakdown product of the nucleotide base adenine , and that undetected protein contamination was at most 0 @.@ 02 % by Hotchkiss 's estimation . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 The experimental findings of the Avery – MacLeod – McCarty experiment were quickly confirmed , and extended to other hereditary characteristics besides polysaccharide capsules . However , there was considerable reluctance to accept the conclusion that DNA was the genetic material . According to Phoebus Levene 's influential " tetranucleotide hypothesis " , DNA consisted of repeating units of the four nucleotide bases and had little biological specificity . DNA was therefore thought to be the structural component of chromosomes , whereas the genes were thought likely to be made of the protein component of chromosomes . This line of thinking was reinforced by the 1935 crystallization of tobacco mosaic virus by Wendell Stanley , and the parallels among viruses , genes , and enzymes ; many biologists thought genes might be a sort of " super @-@ enzyme " , and viruses were shown according to Stanley to be proteins and to share the property of autocatalysis with many enzymes . Furthermore , few biologists thought that genetics could be applied to bacteria , since they lacked chromosomes and sexual reproduction . In particular , many of the geneticists known informally as the phage group , which would become influential in the new discipline of molecular biology in the 1950s , were dismissive of DNA as the genetic material ( and were inclined to avoid the " messy " biochemical approaches of Avery and his colleagues ) . Some biologists , including fellow Rockefeller Institute Fellow Alfred Mirsky , challenged Avery 's finding that the transforming principle was pure DNA , suggesting that protein contaminants were instead responsible . Although transformation occurred in some kinds of bacteria , it could not be replicated in other bacteria ( nor in any higher organisms ) , and its significance seemed limited primarily to medicine . 
 Scientists looking back on the Avery – MacLeod – McCarty experiment have disagreed about just how influential it was in the 1940s and early 1950s . Gunther Stent suggested that it was largely ignored , and only celebrated afterwards — similarly to Gregor Mendel 's work decades before the rise of genetics . Others , such as Joshua Lederberg and Leslie C. Dunn , attest to its early significance and cite the experiment as the beginning of molecular genetics . 
 A few microbiologists and geneticists had taken an interest in the physical and chemical nature of genes before 1944 , but the Avery – MacLeod – McCarty experiment brought renewed and wider interest in the subject . While the original publication did not mention genetics specifically , Avery as well as many of the geneticists who read the paper were aware of the genetic implications — that Avery may have isolated the gene itself as pure DNA . Biochemist Erwin Chargaff , geneticist H. J. Muller and others praised the result as establishing the biological specificity of DNA and as having important implications for genetics if DNA played a similar role in higher organisms . In 1945 , the Royal Society awarded Avery the Copley Medal , in part for his work on bacterial transformation . 
 Between 1944 and 1954 , the paper was cited at least 239 times ( with citations spread evenly through those years ) , mostly in papers on microbiology , <unk> , and biochemistry . In addition to the follow @-@ up work by McCarty and others at the Rockefeller Institute in response to Mirsky 's criticisms , the experiment spurred considerable work in microbiology , where it shed new light on the analogies between bacterial heredity and the genetics of sexually @-@ reproducing organisms . French microbiologist André Boivin claimed to extend Avery 's bacterial transformation findings to Escherichia coli , although this could not be confirmed by other researchers . In 1946 , however , Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum demonstrated bacterial conjugation in E. coli and showed that genetics could apply to bacteria , even if Avery 's specific method of transformation was not general . Avery 's work also may have played a role in the continuation of X @-@ ray crystallography studies of DNA by Maurice Wilkins , who faced pressure from his funders to make whole cells , rather than biological molecules , the subject of his research . 
 Despite the significant number of citations to the paper and positive responses it received in the years following publication , Avery 's work was largely neglected by much of the scientific community . Although received positively by many scientists , the experiment did not seriously affect mainstream genetics research , in part because it made little difference for classical genetics experiments in which genes were defined by their behavior in breeding experiments rather than their chemical makeup . H. J. Muller , while interested , was focused more on physical rather than chemical studies of the gene , as were most of the members of the phage group . Avery 's work was also neglected by the Nobel Foundation , which later expressed public regret for failing to award Avery a Nobel Prize . 
 By the time of the 1952 Hershey – Chase experiment , geneticists were more inclined to consider DNA as the genetic material , and Alfred Hershey was an influential member of the phage group . Erwin Chargaff had shown that the base composition of DNA varies by species ( contrary to the tetranucleotide hypothesis ) , and in 1952 Rollin Hotchkiss published his experimental evidence both confirming Chargaff 's work and demonstrating the absence of protein in Avery 's transforming principle . Furthermore , the field of bacterial genetics was quickly becoming established , and biologists were more inclined to think of heredity in the same terms for bacteria and higher organisms . After Hershey and Chase used radioactive isotopes to show that it was primarily DNA , rather than protein , that entered bacteria upon infection with bacteriophage , it was soon widely accepted that DNA was the material . Despite the much less precise experimental results ( they found a not @-@ insignificant amount of protein entering the cells as well as DNA ) , the Hershey – Chase experiment was not subject to the same degree of challenge . Its influence was boosted by the growing network of the phage group and , the following year , by the publicity surrounding the DNA structure proposed by Watson and Crick ( Watson was also a member of the phage group ) . Only in retrospect , however , did either experiment definitively prove that DNA is the genetic material . 
 = Gomphus clavatus = 
 Gomphus clavatus , commonly known pig 's ears or violet chanterelle , as is an edible species of fungus in the genus Gomphus , family Gomphaceae native to Eurasia and North America . The fruit body is vase- or fan @-@ shaped with wavy edges to its rim , and grows up to 15 cm ( 6 in ) wide and 17 cm ( 6 3 ⁄ 4 in ) tall . The upper surface or cap is orangish @-@ brown to lilac , while its lower spore @-@ bearing surface , the hymenium , is covered in wrinkles and ridges rather than gills or pores , and is a distinctive purple color . Described by Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1774 , G. clavatus has had several name changes and many alternate scientific names , having been classified as a chanterelle by several authorities , though it is not closely related to them . 
 Typically found in coniferous forests , G. clavatus is mycorrhizal , and is associated with tree species in a variety of coniferous genera , particularly spruces and firs . It is more common at elevations of greater than 2 @,@ 000 ft ( 600 m ) , in moist , shady areas with plenty of leaf litter . Although widespread , G. clavatus has become rare in many parts of Europe and extinct in Great Britain . It has been placed on the national Red Lists of threatened fungi in 17 European countries and is one of 33 species proposed for international conservation under the Bern Convention . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer described <unk> ( subsequently Helvella ) purpurascens in 1774 . Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen gave it the name Clavaria <unk> in 1781 , reporting that it appeared in the fir tree forests around Klagenfurt in August and was common around <unk> . He recorded that poor people ate it , giving it the local name hare 's ear . In 1796 , mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon described G. clavatus as Merulius clavatus , noting that it grew in grassy locations in woods . He noted it was the same species that Schäffer had described . The specific epithet — derived from the Latin word <unk> ( club ) and meaning " club @-@ shaped " — refers to the shape of young fruit bodies . In his 1801 Synopsis methodica fungorum , Persoon placed Merulius clavatus ( recognising two varieties — violaceus and spadiceus ) in a section Gomphus within Merulius . 
 British botanist Samuel Frederick Gray used Persoon 's name , transferring the violet chanterelle to the genus Gomphus in 1821 . As it is the first named member of the genus it became the type species . The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January 1 , 1821 , to coincide with the date of the works of the ' father of mycology ' , Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries , which meant the name required sanction by Fries ( indicated in the name by a colon ) to be considered valid . Thus the species was written as Gomphus clavatus ( Pers . : Fr . ) Gray . A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May 1 , 1753 , the date of publication of Linnaeus ' work , the Species Plantarum . Hence , the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries ' authority . Persoon followed suit in treating Gomphus as a separate genus in his 1825 work Mycologia Europaea . Here he recognized M. clavatus as the same species as Clavaria truncata described by Casimir Christoph <unk> in 1796 , calling the taxon Gomphus truncatus . 
 Fries himself declined to keep the genus separate , instead classifying Gomphus as a tribe within the genus Cantharellus in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum , the species becoming Cantharellus clavatus . He recognized four varieties : <unk> @-@ spadiceus , carneus , purpurascens and <unk> . Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan described three taxa — Merulius clavatus carneus , M. clavatus violaceus and M. clavatus purpurascens — in his 1833 work Mycographie Suisse . Many of his names have been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan had a narrow species concept , dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities , and his works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently . Fries revised his classification in his 1838 book Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis <unk> , placing it in a series — <unk> — in the genus Craterellus . 
 Paul Kummer raised many of Fries ' <unk> ( subgenera ) to genus rank in his 1871 work Der Führer in die Pilzkunde , classifying the violet chanterelle in the genus Thelephora . Jacques Emile <unk> and Narcisse Théophile Patouillard placed it in the genus <unk> ( also spelt <unk> ) in 1886 , removing it from Cantharellus on account of its orange spores . However , Charles Horton Peck discarded the name in 1887 and returned G. clavatus to Cantharellus . In 1891 , German botanist Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum , his response to what he perceived as poor method in existing nomenclatural practice . He coined the genus Trombetta to incorporate the violet chanterelle , hence giving it the name Trombetta clavata . However , Kuntze 's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists . 
 Alexander H. Smith treated Gomphus as a section within Cantharellus in his 1947 review of chanterelles in western North America , as he felt there were no consistent characteristics that distinguished the two genera . In 1966 E.J.H. Corner described a small @-@ spored variety , G. clavatus var. <unk> , from specimens collected in Uganda ; it is not considered to have independent taxonomic significance . 
 Research combining the use of phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences and more traditional morphology @-@ based characters has resulted in a reshuffling of the species concept in Gomphus ; as a result , G. clavatus is considered the only Gomphus species in North America . Comparison of the DNA sequences of species Gomphus brevipes and Gomphus truncatus has shown them to be genetically identical to G. clavatus , and they may be treated as synonyms . 
 Gomphus clavatus is commonly known as pig 's ears , alluding to the violet underside and yellowish cap of the fruit bodies , although this vernacular name is also used for Discina <unk> . Other English common names for this species include clustered chanterelle and violet chanterelle . Gray coined the name clubbed <unk> . In the Sherpa language of Nepal the fungus is known as <unk> ( " mother @-@ in @-@ law " ) , as its imposing fruit body is reminiscent of a mother @-@ in @-@ law , who has a dominant role in the Sherpa family .

 The basidiocarps , or fruit bodies , of immature Gomphus clavatus are club @-@ shaped and have one cap or pileus , but later spread out and have a so @-@ called <unk> appearance — several vase @-@ shaped caps rising from a common stem . The fruit body is up to 15 cm ( 6 in ) wide and 17 cm ( 6 3 ⁄ 4 in ) tall , fan @-@ shaped with wavy edges . The upper surfaces of the fruit bodies are covered with brown hyphae that form small , distinct patches towards the margin , but combine to form a continuous felt @-@ like tomentum over the center of the cap . The color of the upper cap surface is orange @-@ brown to violet , but later in age fades to a lighter brown . The cap margins of older mushrooms can be quite ragged . The lower spore @-@ bearing surface — the hymenium — is wrinkled , often with folds and pits , and violet to brown in color . The solid stem , which is continuous with the cap , is 0 @.@ 8 – 3 cm ( 3 ⁄ 8 – 1 1 ⁄ 8 in ) wide , 4 – 10 cm ( 1 5 ⁄ 8 – 3 7 ⁄ 8 in ) tall , and covered with fine hairs ( tomentum ) that become more coarse ( hispid ) towards the base . It is often compound , with several fruit bodies arising from the basal portion . Fruit bodies may bruise reddish @-@ brown where handled . The flesh can be whitish @-@ pink to lilac or cinnamon @-@ buff . Thick under the center of the cap , it thins out towards the margins . It can be crunchy , though it is softer than that of the chanterelle . The taste and odor are mild . The spore print is yellow to orange @-@ yellow . 
 Basidiospores are elliptical , wrinkled or slightly warted , and 10 – 14 by 5 – 7 @.@ 5 μm . The spores are nonamyloid , meaning they have a negative color reaction with the iodine in Melzer 's reagent . The spore @-@ bearing structures , the basidia , are elongated or club @-@ shaped , hyaline ( glassy or translucent ) , and four @-@ spored , with dimensions of 60 – 90 by 8 @.@ 5 – 11 @.@ 5 μm .

 Gomphus crassipes , found in Spain and North America , can only be reliably distinguished from G. clavatus with the use of a microscope . Its basidiospores are generally longer ( 11 – 17 by 5 @.@ 5 – 7 μm ) and have a more finely wrinkled surface . The North American species G. <unk> features a dull orange cap with erect scales , and a stalk with decurrent folds . It associates with conifers . <unk> <unk> ( formerly classified in Gomphus ) is a lookalike species that grow under conifers in the central United States and westward , also differing on microscopic characters and reaction to potassium hydroxide . Turbinellus floccosus and T. kauffmanii are of similar shape but their caps are covered in scales . The edible blue chanterelle ( Polyozellus multiplex ) could be confused with G. clavatus , but has distinctive spores . 
 = = Habitat , distribution , and conservation = = 
 Gomphus clavatus grows singly , in clusters or clumps , or even occasionally fairy rings , on the ground , typically in coniferous forests , and with a preference for moist , shady areas with deep leaf litter , or rotten wood debris on the ground . The species is equally common in older or younger stands of trees . Fruit bodies are easily missed because their colors blend with those of the forest floor . It is more common at elevations of greater than 2 @,@ 000 ft ( 600 m ) . Gomphus clavatus has been reported as forming symbiotic ( mycorrhizal ) associations with a variety of trees : Abies alba , Abies <unk> , Abies firma , Abies <unk> , Abies religiosa , Picea species , Pinus densiflora , Pseudotsuga menziesii , and Tsuga heterophylla . It is also reported with beech ( Fagus sylvatica ) in Europe . 
 In Asia , Gomphus clavatus has been reported from China , Japan , Korea , Malaysia , Nepal , and Pakistan . European countries that have reported the fungus include Austria , the Czech Republic , France , Germany , Greece , Italy , Lithuania , Poland , Romania , Russia , Sweden , Switzerland , and Turkey . In North America , the fungus has been found across Canada , Mexico , and the United States , where it is abundant in the Pacific Northwest . 
 In Europe , Gomphus clavatus appears on the national Red Lists of threatened fungi in 17 countries and is one of 33 species proposed for international conservation under the Bern Convention . Due to a substantial decline in sightings , Gomphus clavatus became a legally protected species in Hungary on September 1 , 2005 . It also has legal protection in Slovakia and Slovenia . The species formerly occurred in England , but has not been seen since 1927 and is now regarded as extinct . The fungus faces loss and degradation of its habitat ; eutrophication is another potential threat . Gomphus clavatus was selected as the 1998 Pilz des <unk> ( " Mushroom of the Year " ) by the German Mycological Society , partly to highlight its vulnerable status . 
 = = Edibility = = 
 Gomphus clavatus is edible ( and rated as choice by some ) , while others find it tasteless . It has an earthy flavor and meaty texture that complements red meat dishes . Like many edible fungi , consumption may cause gastrointestinal distress in susceptible individuals . The flesh becomes bitter with age , and older specimens may be infested with insects . Insect infestation is unlikely if the weather is cool . G. clavatus has been used for cooking for some time — Fries included it in his 1867 book Sveriges <unk> och <unk> <unk> ( Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden ) . It is highly regarded by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca , and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal . 
 Extracts prepared from G. clavatus fruit bodies have a high antioxidant activity , and a high concentration of phenolic and flavonoid compounds . Phenolic compounds identified from the fungus include <unk> acid , gallic acid , gentisic acid , <unk> acid , <unk> acid , cinnamic acid , caffeic acid , ferulic acid , and tannic acid . In a chemical analysis of collections from the South Aegean Region of Turkey , the fungus was shown to have bioaccumulated the toxic metal cadmium to levels exceeding the maximum intake recommended by the European Union Scientific Committee on Food . 
 = M @-@ 34 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 34 is an east – west state trunkline highway in the southeastern region of the US state of Michigan . It has a western terminus near Osseo on M @-@ 99 and runs through forest and farm lands to its eastern terminus at Business US Highway 223 ( BUS US 223 ) and M @-@ 52 in Adrian . The highway serves a number of smaller communities in the area and intersects two US Highways while carrying between 4 @,@ 200 and 11 @,@ 300 vehicles on a daily basis . 
 M @-@ 34 was designated and signed with the beginning of the state highway system around July 1 , 1919 , along a route that extended to either end of its current routing . These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s , shortening M @-@ 34 to roughly its current length . A few more changes were made in the mid @-@ 1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing . M @-@ 34 has a short , unsigned sibling , Connector 34 , which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area .

 M @-@ 34 begins at an intersection with M @-@ 99 just west of Osseo . M @-@ 99 approaches Osseo from the west along Hudson Road and where M @-@ 99 turns south along Pioneer Road , M @-@ 34 continues east along Hudson Road . The highway turns to the southeast to the south of Osseo near Deer Lake and continues towards Pittsford . Hudson Road runs through a mix of forests and local farms . The trunkline passes to the south of the main business district in Pittsford . East of town , the highway turns east and intersects US Highway 127 ( US 127 ) at the Hillsdale – Lenawee county line in Hudson . The trunkline continues eastward through the city of Hudson as Main Street . On the eastern edge of town , it becomes Carleton Road and passes through more farmland . Just south of Clayton , M @-@ 34 has a junction with the northern terminus of M @-@ 156 , a connector highway that runs south into Ohio and US 20 . 
 Approximately four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) east of that junction , M @-@ 34 turns north for about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) along Benner Highway and passes through the community of Cadmus . At the end of its course along Benner Highway , M @-@ 34 turns east towards Adrian on Beecher Road . There are some residential subdivisions along the road on the southwest side of Adrian . M @-@ 34 intersects Industrial Drive and crosses US 223 and Beecher Road becomes Beecher Street in town . The trunkline continues east and terminates at the intersection of Beecher and Main streets where it meets BUS US 223 / M @-@ 52 . 
 M @-@ 34 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 34 were the 11 @,@ 302 vehicles daily immediately east of the BUS US 223 / M @-@ 52 junction in Adrian ; the lowest counts were the 4 @,@ 166 vehicles per day between Hudson and the M @-@ 156 junction . No section of M @-@ 34 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 When the state highway system was signed around July 1 , 1919 , M @-@ 34 started in Jonesville at an intersection with M @-@ 23 along the present @-@ day alignment of M @-@ 99 . The highway ran to Adrian along its present route and continued southeasterly along present @-@ day US 223 through Blissfield , where it terminated at the Ohio state line near Sylvania , Ohio . In 1924 , the western terminus of the highway was extended to Homer where it terminated at M @-@ 60 . Just a few years later , in 1926 , the western terminus was truncated , to end at Hillsdale , with the remainder to Jonesville becoming an extension of the M @-@ 64 of the day . At the same time , the eastern segment of M @-@ 34 from Adrian to the border was assumed into the US 127 corridor , therefore , scaling the terminus back to US 127 ( now US 223 ) . 
 In 1954 , a new US 223 bypass was built around Adrian , resulting in the relocation of M @-@ 34 to end at BUS US 223 / M @-@ 52 .

 " Schizogeny " is the ninth episode of the fifth season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on January 11 , 1998 . It was written by Jessica Scott and Mike Wollaeger , directed by Ralph Hemecker , and featured guest appearances by Bob Dawson , Myles Ferguson , Katharine Isabelle , Chad Lindberg , and Sarah @-@ Jane Redmond . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Schizogeny " earned a Nielsen household rating of 12 @.@ 9 , being watched by 21 @.@ 37 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mixed to negative reviews , with several critics calling it the worst episode of The X @-@ Files . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder and Scully become convinced that a greater evil may be lurking in the community when a teenager is suspected of murdering his father . 
 " Schizogeny " , written by first @-@ year staff writers Scott and Wollaeger , became humorously known as " The Killer Tree Episode " amongst the cast and crew . Many of the scenes shot for " Schizogeny " were filmed on a real orchard named <unk> Farms near the small town of Fort Langley , British Columbia . The episode utilized various post @-@ production techniques , in order to clear up vocal issues and to censor one line , which Fox 's standards and practices department had issues with . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Coats Grove , Michigan , teenager Bobby Rich is berated by his stepfather Phil for not finishing his lawn work outside the house . Bobby runs into a nearby orchard and Phil gives chase . When Bobby 's mother , Patti , follows them into the orchard , she discovers Phil 's body partially buried , seemingly drowned in mud . Kneeling beside Phil is Bobby , his eyes wide with terror . 
 Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) are assigned to the case . At the scene , Scully hypothesizes that Bobby dug the pit that trapped his stepfather , and speculates that he had an accomplice . Patti tells Scully that , from her point of view , it appeared as if Bobby was attempting to help Phil out of the orchard pit when he died . She also reveals that her son has anger management issues and has been undergoing therapy for several years . When Mulder and Scully meet with Bobby 's therapist , Karin Matthews , she describes Bobby as the victim of physical abuse . Mulder expresses his belief that Bobby is not to blame for Phil 's death . 
 Bobby tells a fellow student , Lisa Baiocchi , that she must stand up to her overbearing father just as he had done with Phil . When Lisa returns home , a window explodes and a shadowy , arm @-@ like appendage grabs her father by the throat after he demands she stop seeing Bobby . His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground outside the house . Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed out the window , Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out by an outside force . Later , the agents learn that Lisa is another one of Karin Matthews ' patients . 
 Mulder finds a small splinter of fresh wood embedded in Mr. Baiocchi 's neck , and matches the fragment to a tree outside the Baiocchi home . A short time later , the agents are approached by a man named Ramirez , who claims that the trees are all dying because of a " very bad man . " Meanwhile , Karin invites Lisa to stay at her home until her aunt can pick her up the following day . As Lisa listens from her bedroom , she overhears an argument between Karin and a male voice . When she descends into Karin 's root cellar , she discovers the skeletal body of a man . Terrified , Lisa turns towards the door , only to have the door close and lock . 
 Mulder discovers that Karin 's father was pulled from the mud of an orchard twenty years earlier . Ramirez tells him that the death brought about an end of a blight affecting the trees . Later , Mulder digs up Mr. Matthews ' casket and finds it filled with roots , his body missing . When Lisa 's aunt , Linda , arrives at Karin 's house to retrieve her niece , she is attacked and killed by an unseen force as tree branches sway in the wind above her . Karin enters the root cellar , and is revealed to be the source of the male voice Lisa heard earlier , due to her having <unk> personality disorder brought on by abuse from her own father . 
 When Mulder and Scully search Karin 's house , they come upon the corpse — belonging to Karin 's father — in the root cellar . They then find Lisa , frightened but unharmed , in the kitchen . Karin drives to Bobby 's house and chases him into the orchard . Suddenly , Bobby is dragged downward into the mud . While attempting to rescue the teenager , Mulder simultaneously encourages Karin to break the cycle and to fight the voice inside her head . A tendon @-@ like root snakes out of the mud and begins to drag Mulder downward . Ramirez appears , his axe in hand , and decapitates Karin , killing her . Mulder and Bobby are released by the unseen force .

 " Schizogeny " was written by first @-@ year staff writers Jessica Scott and Mike Wollaeger , who had previously worked on The X @-@ Files in non @-@ writing jobs . Due to the episode 's tree @-@ based conceit , it eventually became known as " The Killer Tree Episode " amongst the cast and crew . Executive producer Frank Spotnitz noted that " Schizogeny " underwent an abnormally lengthy writing process and was edited several times . He later said that the episode " went through many , many incarnations and versions . " The title is a reference to the scientific term for asexual reproduction . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 When it came time to cast the character of Bobby Rich , Chad Lindberg , who played a cystic fibrosis sufferer on the medical drama ER , was chosen . Katharine Isabelle , who portrayed Lisa Baiocchi , was the daughter of Graeme Murray , the production designer for The X @-@ Files . Kate Robbins , who portrayed Lisa 's aunt Linda , had previously appeared in the third season episode " D.P.O. " 
 Several lines in the episode were re @-@ recorded . During post @-@ production , editors feared that Rich 's mumbly voice would make it hard for viewers to understand what he was saying , so he was brought back in to re @-@ record his dialogue , which was then dubbed over the footage . In addition , during the scene wherein Mulder tells Scully that Bobby 's nickname at school , the original version featured Mulder audibly saying " <unk> . " Fox 's standards and practices department made the show change the name to " <unk> , " which required David Duchovny to re @-@ dub his line . 
 = = = Set and score = = = 
 Many of the scenes shot for " Schizogeny " were filmed on a real orchard named <unk> Farms near the small town of Fort Langley , British Columbia . Other shots , mostly involving the sinking mud scenes , were shot on a soundstage at Lion 's Gate Studios that was fitted with over 200 hazelnut trees . The mud pit was made out of a large tank filled with peat moss , mud , and water . The mixture was heated so that the actors would not be uncomfortable during the sinking scenes . The shot that called for Karin Matthews ' lifeless body to sink into the mud required a stunt woman to be slowly lowered into the pit . The crew found it necessary to supply her oxygen during the shot because of the depth of the pit . Toby Lindala and her art department created all of the props used in the episode , including the moving tree roots and the skeletal remains of Karin Matthews ' father . 
 Several of the sets were chosen because of their proximity to large trees . Lisa 's house , for instance , was built next to a large willow . An additional tree limb that was more than twenty feet long was attached to the real tree to give it a more menacing feel . The tree limb that attacked Mulder 's car was a branch of a massive tree that had fallen on a nearby plot of public land . The producers secured permission from the Canadian government and hoisted the tree with a crane and then dropped it onto a former police cruiser . Nigel Habgood , the series car coordinator , was able to refurbish the cruiser and it was later used in the episode " Kill Switch . " Mark Snow , composer for the series , was particularly proud of the music he wrote for the episode , noting that the story was a " dark tale with a wonderful aura about it . " He credits this ominous feel to woodwind instruments .

 = Defective Premises Act 1972 = 
 The Defective Premises Act 1972 ( c . 35 ) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that covers landlords ' and builders ' liability for poorly constructed and poorly maintained buildings , along with any injuries that may result . During the 19th century , the common law principle that a landlord could not be liable for letting a poorly maintained house was established , while a long @-@ running principle was that , in practice , builders could not be sued for constructing defective buildings . The courts began to turn against the first principle during the 20th century , imposing several restrictions on the landlord 's immunity , but the landlord was still largely free from being sued . 
 The Defective Premises Bill was introduced to the House of Commons as a private member 's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971 , and given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972 , coming into force as the Defective Premises Act 1972 on 1 January 1974 . The Act establishes a duty of care builders and their sub @-@ contractors owe to the occupiers of property they construct or modify , and also establishes a duty of care landlords hold towards their tenants and any third parties who might be injured by their failure to maintain or repair property . The Act received a mixed reaction from critics ; while some complimented it on its simple nature compared to the previously complex common rule laws , others felt that it was too limited for what was desired to be achieved , and that the wording used was at times both too vague and too specific . 
 = = Background = = 
 Prior to the passing of the Act , builders who constructed defective buildings could not , practically , be sued under tort . At the same time , a landlord who let a dilapidated or defective house could not be sued for injuries suffered by non @-@ tenants , something based first on the " Privity of Tort " principle that was overturned in Donoghue v Stevenson [ 1932 ] AC 562 ( that if A had a contract with B and in the process injured C , C was prevented from suing A because of the contract with B ) and the decision in Robbins v Jones [ 1863 ] 15 CB ( ns ) 221 , where Chief Justice Earl said that " a landlord who lets a house in a dangerous state is not liable for accidents happening during the term ; for , fraud apart , there is no law against letting a tumbledown house " . This immunity was further extended in later cases . 
 The courts began to turn against this position in the 20th century ; the case of Cunard v <unk> [ 1933 ] 1 KB 551 established that a landlord could be liable if the source of an injury emanated from property of which he was in possession , even if the injury happened on land he no longer owned or occupied . In Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council [ 1972 ] 1 QB 373 , the courts arguably abolished the immunity of the landlord completely . By 1974 , this immunity excluded situations where the danger came from premises that the landlord occupied and where the landlord actively created a danger , and only included the landlord , not associated people . 
 The Defective Premises Bill was introduced to the House of Commons as a private member 's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971 , and was not debated at all in the Commons , something the academic lawyer Peter North called " remarkable " . There was some debate in the House of Lords , with questions and amendments covering Section 1 , but the bill was not substantially amended , something North puts down to the quality of the draft prepared by the Law Commission . The Act was given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972 , and came into force on 1 January 1974 . 
 = = Act = = 
 = = = Duty of care = = = 
 Section 1 of the Act lays out the duty of care and who it applies to . The duty applies to " A person taking on work for or in connection with the provision of a dwelling ( whether the dwelling is provided by the erection or by the conversion or enlargement of a building ) " , something including not only builders but also electricians , plumbers and other subcontractors . The duty also extends to those who have statutory powers to arrange for the provision of dwellings , and those who do so in the course of business . This duty is owed to two classes of people ; the person ordering the house , and also every person who later takes an equitable and legal interest in the house . 
 The duty itself is laid out in Section 1 ( 1 ) , and is a duty on the people covered by the act " to see that the work which he takes on is done in a workmanlike or , as the case may be , professional manner , with proper materials and so that as regards that work the dwelling will be fit for habitation when completed " . This is a three @-@ part test , all parts of which must be fulfilled ; if , for example , a house is badly designed but well @-@ built , the architect will be held responsible even though the house is habitable . Those owing a duty can be released from their obligations if they are acting according to the claimant 's instructions , under Section 1 ( 2 ) . If they act completely in accordance with the instructions , the duty of care is fulfilled even though the house may not be properly constructed . However , if the claimant instructs the builder to construct a poorly designed and unstable building , the builder has a duty to warn the claimant . Section 2 of the Act excludes " approved scheme " constructions , such as those run by the National House Building Council . 
 = = = Disposal of premises = = = 
 Prior to the passage of the Act , the owner of premises who created a danger there disposed of his duty of care when he disposed of the property by selling or leasing it , something North described as both " bizarre " and " capricious in operation , unjust in the result and indefensible in principle " . Section 3 ( 1 ) of the Act , therefore , establishes that where work is done on premises , whatever duty of care may arise as a result of the work to people affected by defects in the work is not disposed of if the property is sold or let . Section 3 ( 2 ) qualifies this principle by providing exceptions , which are when the property is the subject of a tenancy and when the property has been disposed of ( or is in the process of being disposed of ) before 1 January 1974 , when the Act came into force . 
 = = = Landlord 's duty of care = = = 
 Prior to the passage of the Occupiers ' Liability Act 1957 , the general principle was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by third parties on their property . The 1957 Act qualified this , providing in Section 4 ( repealed by the Defective Premises Act ) that where a landlord was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation , third parties injured as a result of the breach would be able to claim providing that the tenant could . This provision was limited ; it provided no remedy to the tenant himself , and only applied to lawful visitors , not trespassers . In addition , it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property ; if he simply had the option to do so , there was no remedy for an injured third party . Similarly , if a tenant failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair , any resulting injury could not be sued upon . 
 Section 4 of the Act includes new provisions to cover this sort of situation . Section 4 ( 1 ) establishes a general duty to repair and maintain the property , owed by the landlord to anyone who could reasonably be expected to be harmed by a breach ; this includes tenants , their friends and family and also trespassers . This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect , not just when he has been informed of a defect . Additionally , a landlord who merely has the right to repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable , if one of the groups described in Section 4 was harmed by their failure to repair . 
 = = = Miscellaneous = = = 
 The Act includes a number of miscellaneous points , mainly in Sections 5 and 6 . The Act and its provisions are taken to extend to The Crown , which can be held tortiously liable to the extent laid out in the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 . It repeals Section 4 of the Occupiers ' Liability Act 1957 , replacing it with Section 4 of this Act , and unlike the 1957 Act does not allow any provisions or duties to be excluded or restricted . 
 = = Commentary and further territorial extent = = 
 The Act met a mixed review from academics . North praised it , saying that " The Act admirably disposes of confusion , controversy , illogicality and point @-@ less distinctions " , while admitting that the vagueness of much of it left it up to the courts to flesh out the statute . Others were more critical ; academic Vera Bermingham pointed out that the exclusion of liability for " approved scheme " buildings under Section 2 at the time included almost all new houses built within the United Kingdom , although these schemes have been much reduced since the 1980s . At the same time , actions brought under the Act are the subject of a six @-@ year limitation period starting on the date the dwelling is completed , regardless of when the defect is discovered , which is a " significant [ drawback ] in the utility of the [ Act ] " . Academic John Spencer criticised both Section 1 and Section 3 , the former for being too vaguely worded and the latter for being too specific . Spencer argues that , because of limitations imposed by the bill 's sponsors , the original meaning of the draft bill was changed , and the Act itself goes no further than the existing common law . 
 The Defective Premises ( Northern Ireland ) Order 1975 brought identical provisions into force in Northern Ireland on 1 January 1976 , with the section covering injuries to third parties excluded . 
 = Woollen industry in Wales = 
 The woollen industry in Wales was at times the country 's most important industry , though it often struggled to compete with the better @-@ funded woollen mills in the north of England , and almost disappeared during the 20th century . There is continued demand for quality Welsh woollen products . 
 Wool processing includes removing the fleece by shearing , classing the wool by quality , untangling , carding and spinning it into yarn , which may be knitted or woven into cloth , then finishing the cloth by fulling , napping and pressing . Spinning and weaving of sheep 's wool dates to prehistoric times in Wales , but only became an important industry when Cistercian monasteries were established in the 12th century . Water @-@ powered fulling mills to finish the cloth enabled rapid expansion of the industry in the 13th century , although spinning and weaving continued to be a cottage industry . In the early 16th century production shifted from south Wales to mid and north Wales . The Shrewsbury Drapers Company in England took a dominant role in distributing Welsh cloth . From the 18th century there was strong demand for cheap , sturdy Welsh material shipped from Bristol , Liverpool or the Welsh ports to clothe slaves in the British colonies of North America and the West Indies . 
 During the Industrial Revolution the Welsh woollen industry was slow to <unk> compared to the mills of northern England . When railways reached mid Wales in the 1860s they brought a flood of cheap mass @-@ produced products that destroyed the local industry . However , development of the South Wales Coalfield opened a growing market for woollen products from water @-@ powered mills in the south west , which prospered until after World War I. At one time there were more than 300 working wool mills . The industry went into steady decline after World War I , and only a few mills continue to operate . 
 = = Process = = 
 Sheep shearing was a major social event on Welsh farms . The fleece would be removed intact , then carefully folded to make it easier to sort out the different grades of wool at the mill . The quality of wool depends on the individual sheep and on the part of the sheep 's body from which the wool has been taken . The common Welsh Mountain sheep are hardy and thrive in the cold and wet conditions of the Welsh highlands . The wool is soft and may have <unk> and black , grey or red fibres , which makes it attractive in tweeds and upholstery . Staple length is 5 to 15 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 to 5 @.@ 9 in ) . Black Welsh Mountain sheep had mutton that was prized for its quality , and produced valuable <unk> wool with a staple length of 8 to 10 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 to 3 @.@ 9 in ) . 
 After sorting , the raw wool would often be soaked in a 50 – 50 solution of human urine and water , then passed through a willy to untangle it and remove foreign matter . <unk> completed the disentangling process , creating rolls of wool called <unk> . The fibres in the roving were then spun into woollen yarn . Spinning machines were introduced in the 19th century . The spun fibre would then be woven into cloth , which would be finished by washing and drying , fulling , napping and pressing . Natural dyes were used until the mid @-@ 19th century . The fleece could be " dyed @-@ in @-@ the @-@ wool " , the fibre could be dyed after being spun , or the fabric could be dyed after being woven . 
 = = Prehistoric to early medieval times = = 
 Sheep farming in Wales dates to prehistoric times . There is evidence of spinning and weaving in late prehistoric houses throughout Britain , particularly in the later first millennium B.C .. Finds include scraps of fabric , loom @-@ weights , spindle @-@ whorls and bone needles , and the arrangement of post @-@ holes may indicate they supported looms . For example , a Bronze Age weaving comb was found in the Ogof yr <unk> cave in <unk> . The Romans probably imported the white breed characteristic of Welsh sheep today . The sheep at this time would have been much more variable than modern breeds , which have been carefully selected for specific characteristics . In the early days the sheep were not shorn , but the wool was collected when the sheep moulted in the summer , either by plucking it from their fleece or collecting it where it had been rubbed off on a tree or rock . 
 Excavations have been made at the Dinas Powys hillfort in Glamorgan of what seems to have been the court of an important ruler in the 5th and 6th centuries A.D. The bones of sheep were found , but there seems to have been little spinning and weaving . The 6th century writer Gildas , thought by some to have lived in Wales , mentioned " mountains particularly suitable for the alternating pasturage of animals " . This seems to refer to transhumance , or seasonal movement of shepherds with their flocks , and if so is the earliest mention in Britain . The 10th century Welsh laws of King Hywel Dda allocate pigs to the husband and sheep to the wife . In the summer the pigs were kept in the woods while the wife took and sheep and the children to the highlands . The wife also controlled the dairy , and took the milking and cheese making equipment . Divorce remained an option in Wales longer than elsewhere in Britain . It was assumed that the woman deserved a share of the lambs and calves . 
 = = Medieval period = = 
 In the Middle Ages sheep were probably kept mainly for their milk and wool rather than their meat . Sheep do not seem to have been important to the Welsh economy before the 12th century , when the first Cistercian monasteries were established in Wales . Tintern Abbey in the Wye valley was founded for monks of the Cistercian order by Walter <unk> , lord of Netherwent and <unk> , on 9 May 1131 . All abbeys of the order were to be built in remote rural locations , and had to be simple and unadorned . The order expanded rapidly . Tintern was followed by Whitland ( 1140 ) , its offshoot Strata Florida ( 1164 ) , Strata Marcella ( 1170 ) in Powys <unk> , <unk> ( 1176 ) in <unk> , Llantarnam ( 1179 ) near Caerleon , Aberconwy ( 1186 ) in Gwynedd , <unk> ( 1198 ) in Merionethshire and Valle Crucis ( 1202 ) in Powys <unk> . The monks were granted extensive lands for sheep grazing and were the pioneers of the woollen industry in Wales . 
 The invention of the water @-@ powered fulling mill in the Later Middle Ages caused an industrial revolution in Wales . In the century that preceded the Black Death the monastic landowners and manorial lords built fulling mills in eastern Wales , with up to 80 operating before 1350 . Sometimes a fulling mill and gristmill would share the same building or the same leat and mill pond . There would be a <unk> yard outside the fulling mill where the cloth was stretched on frames . Woollen manufacturing became one of the main rural industries in Wales . Most Welsh cottages and farmhouses had a spinning wheel , almost always operated by women , and most parishes had <unk> , spinners , weavers and fullers . However , most of the production was for personal use rather than sale . 
 The main centre of the new woollen industry was initially in south east Wales drawing on sheep from the monasteries of Margam , Neath and Tintern and the flocks of the Bohun family , which produced 18 @,@ 500 fleeces in 1372 . <unk> mills were later established elsewhere in Wales , particularly the north east and the <unk> valley . In 1380 the lordship of Ruthin in Denbighshire had 36 weavers . However , the period from 1350 to 1400 was difficult , with recurrences of the plague and heavy taxation to pay for the war with France . Between 1350 and 1500 an average of 50 fulling mills were operational . The reduced number was due to the unsettled state of the country before , during and after the Glyndŵr Rising ( 1400 – 15 ) . 
 The quality of wool depended on the local breeds of sheep . In the 15th century south @-@ east Wales produced particularly high quality wool . Margam in West Glamorgan and Tintern in Monmouthshire were noted for their excellent wool . According to Thomas Fuller 's Church History , Wales specialized in manufacturing friezes . A frieze is a coarse woollen cloth that usually has a nap on one side . It was hard @-@ wearing and well @-@ suited for outer garments , and was popular with working men . Cloth was made in many places in Wales , particularly the south west and the northern and southern borderlands . In 1447 there was a guild of weavers and fullers in the lordship of Ruthin , and in the 1460s at least five fulling mills were operating in this location . The cloth was sold locally , in border town markets and in the yearly Bartholomew Fair in London . Welsh friezes were also exported from Welsh ports or from Bristol . 
 In the early 16th century cloth for export was mainly produced in south Wales and shipped from the local ports . During that century there was a shift in production to mid @-@ Wales and north Wales , and the woollen production was exported via Shrewsbury in Shropshire . The Shrewsbury Drapers Company tightly controlled the trade . The Welsh cloth makers , who lacked capital , produced poor quality drapery for which there was relatively low demand . 
 = = Foreign trade = = 
 In 1660 wool made up two thirds of Welsh exports . <unk> in the West Indies and the American colonies found that slaves were more productive if they were clothed . William Lee of Virginia stated that " Good Welch cotton seems upon the whole to answer best " , and others were " light and insufficient . " The main market was at Shrewsbury . The demand for colours was limited . In the 1730s a Charleston merchant ordered " White , <unk> , & Green plains for Negro Clothing . " The South Carolina " Negro Act " of 1735 commended " white Welsh plains " and outlawed rich or colourful materials that might be discarded by the slave masters . In the 1770s one observer said the whole purpose of Welsh woollens was " covering the poor Negroes in the West Indies . " 
 Before 1800 there were very few factories in Wales , and almost all production was at home . As trans @-@ Atlantic demand for Welsh cloth grew , growing numbers of people in the rural areas of Montgomeryshire and Merionethshire became dependent on the woollen industry , finding that spinning and weaving gave a larger and more stable income than farming . Some hamlets grew into woollen manufacturing centres . For example , <unk> tripled in size during the 18th century . In the last decades of the 18th century there was a great expansion of woollen production . Sales of stockings at Bala rose from £ 10 @,@ 000 to £ 18 @,@ 000 annually , and the annual profit of flannel sales in Montgomeryshire was more than £ 40 @,@ 000 . 
 At first much of the cloth was shipped via Shrewsbury and London , but later the specialized Atlantic port of Bristol became the main place from which Welsh plains were shipped across the Atlantic . Over time , factors from Liverpool and Bristol took control of the trade away from the Shrewsbury drapers . Instead of the weavers carrying their cloth to the market towns , the factors came to them to buy the cloth . The factors would extend credit to the poorer weavers so they could buy wool . The Shrewsbury Drapers were losing their control of the trade by 1770 . The port of Barmouth exported woollen products worth £ 50 @,@ 000 around the world in the 1770s . An author wrote of Shrewsbury in the 1790s , 
 From very early days this place possessed almost exclusively the trade with Wales in a coarse kind of woollen cloth called Welsh <unk> , which were brought from Merioneth and Montgomeryshire to a market held here weekly on Thursdays . They were afterwards dressed , that is , the wool raised on one side , by a set of people called <unk> . At the time of Queen Elizabeth , the trade was so great , that not fewer than 600 persons maintained themselves by this occupation . The cloth was sent chiefly to America to clothe the negroes , or to Flanders , where it is used by the peasants . At present the greatest part of this <unk> is diverted into other channels , and not more than four or five hundred thousand yards are brought to the ancient mart . <unk> both coarse and fine are purchased at Welsh @-@ Pool , on every other Monday , by the drapers of Shrewsbury , who now principally enjoy this branch of commerce . 
 By the end of the century the market in Shrewsbury had almost ceased , and in March 1803 the Company gave up the great room in which the trading had been conducted . In 1804 report by Mr. Evans of his tour through north Wales said , 
 The <unk> used to be carried to Liverpool or Shrewsbury to market ; but the Liverpool dealers have now persons in pay on the spot , to purchase of the makers ; and to assist the poorer manufacturers with money to carry on their trade ... Since this , the drapers of Shrewsbury are obliged to go up to the country , and purchase the articles in small quantities at farms and cottages . After undergoing the operation of scouring , bleaching , and milling , it is it is packed up in large bales , and sent to Shrewsbury , Liverpool , and London ; and thence exported to Germany , Russia and America .

 = = = North Wales = = = 
 By the 18th century a transition was under way to textile production in workshops run by businessmen . However , the technological revolution took much longer in Wales than it had in England , with slow adoption of machinery . Until the latter part of the 18th century carding and spinning was done at home , and weaving in the village ty @-@ <unk> ( loom house ) , although fulling was done by machine in fulling mills . A 1799 report said 
 The chief staple commodities of North Wales , as well as of the nation at large , are those manufactured of wool . ... In Anglesey , the inhabitants buy quantities of the Snowdon coarse wool , at the fairs of Caernarvon , and Bangor ; out of which , mixed with their own wool , they manufacture deep blue coloured cloth , flannels , blankets , & c. a <unk> for home use and no more . ... In <unk> , they apply themselves somewhat more to spinning and weaving ; for , besides supplying themselves with wearing apparel , they annually send several pieces of blue cloth into <unk> ... In Flintshire , and the greater part of Denbighshire , they are still less disposed to the exercise of the wheel and the loom . ... In other parts of Denbighshire , in the south west of <unk> and Montgomeryshire , the inhabitants have imbibed more of the spirit of industry ; and add the profits of manufacture to the value of the raw material ... 
 Mill owners were not always men . There are records of three women mill owners in Wales in 1840 , Mary Powell with 16 looms and 8 men , Ann Harris with 14 employees including 6 man , and Ann <unk> with 9 employees . Large spinning mills continued to operate in Llangollen in the north throughout the 19th century . For example , the <unk> Woollen Mills , originally called the Vale of Conwy Woollen Mill , was built in 1820 on the banks of the Afon <unk> . Thomas Williams purchased the mill in 1859 and expanded the business . Products from the woollen mills were taken to the coast from the quay at <unk> using the River Conwy . A 36 feet ( 11 m ) diameter overshot wheel powered spinning mules and jennies . The yarn was then woven into cloth on hand looms . A smaller 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) wheel powered a fulling mill , which washed the cloth and kneaded it with wooden hammers to thicken and strengthen it . The mill was still in operation ( in a newer building ) as of 2016 . 
 = = = Mid @-@ Wales = = = 
 Between 1800 and 1830 many spinning and weaving factories were built in mid @-@ Wales in places where water power was available , particularly in the upper Severn Valley in Powys . Towns such as Welshpool , Newtown and Llanidloes tripled in size and became industrial towns , although they were dwarfed by the English centres of Bradford and Leeds . Due to lack of capital the factories often went bankrupt when trade turned down . When steam power began to be used by the Yorkshire woollen industry the Severn Valley mills were at a disadvantage , since they did not have nearby supplies of coal . In 1835 the Montgomeryshire weaving towns still had only four power looms . 
 The 1840 Parliamentary Gazetteer wrote of Montgomeryshire that the flannel makers were facing competition from Lancashire imitation flannels , although these were not as good as the Welsh . Hand looms were preferred to power looms for the finer qualities of flannel , and experiments with power looms at Newport and Welshpool had been abandoned . Welsh wool had much improved in quality , but Radnorshire or South Devon wool was still best for flannel manufacture . The farmers , especially around <unk> , employed their agricultural labourers in spinning and weaving in the winter months . The gazetteer noted that , " the principle of total abstinence from intoxicating liquors has much benefited the weavers in this county : they were formerly notorious for <unk> and <unk> . " In 1838 there were 61 mills in the county , mainly water @-@ powered , employing 507 males and 216 females . 
 In 1847 Llanidloes was continuing to grow despite competition from Newtown . The Cambrian Mirror reported that , " There are now more than 40 carding engines , 18 fulling mills , and nearly 35 @,@ 000 spindles , constantly in operation in the town and neighbourhood , affording considerable employment to a number of men , who weave the flannel at their own dwellings . Pryce Pryce @-@ Jones of Newtown began a mail @-@ order business in flannels in 1859 , a very innovative move for the time . He was at first extremely successful , and the London and North Western Railway ran a daily service with special vans to carry his products to Euston station in London . Between 1850 and 1870 the mill owners in Llanidloes and Newtown invested heavily in buildings and steam @-@ powered machinery . They hoped that the railway , which reached the towns between 1861 and 1863 , would give them access to new markets . In fact , the railway caused mass @-@ produced goods from northern England to flood into central Wales . Newtown , which once was called the " Leeds of Wales " , went into decline from the 1860s . 
 There were periods of renewed prosperity . The Cambrian Mills in Newtown was purchased in 1966 by the Cambrian Flannel Company of Newtown and Llanidloes , which modernized the factory so it was the most advanced facility in Wales and diversified into making plain and coloured flannels , shawls , whittles , hose and tweeds . Later the Newtown woollen industry again went into decline . The Pryce @-@ Jones " Welsh " flannel was eventually mostly made in Rochdale , Manchester . After the Cambrian Mills burned down in 1912 Newtown was no longer an important woollen industrial centre and many of the workers moved elsewhere . 
 Welsh tweed manufacture survived at a much reduced level into the 20th century in Montgomery , where the area around Rhayader retained mills in the villages and small towns . Newtown continued to make flannel , although Rochdale in northwest England took market share with its " real Welch flannel . " J. Geraint Jenkins has speculated that if a railway line had instead connected the Severn Valley to the south Wales coalfield the mid @-@ Wales woollen industry could have been supported by demand for flannel from the miners , as were the woollen mills of the Teifi valley in the later part of the 19th century . 
 = = = South Wales = = = 
 During the Industrial Revolution the Teifi Valley between Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire came to employ thousands of weavers , spinners , dyers , <unk> , drapers and tailors . The river and its tributaries powered dozens of mills , and sheep in the surrounding grassland supplied fleeces to be made into woollen products . In 1837 a Working Men 's Association was established in the south Wales weaving town of Carmarthen in response to the Chartist campaign for democratic rights . By the summer of 1839 three more towns in the region had founded such societies , and the first Chartist convention had been held . 
 While manufacturing declined in mid @-@ Wales after the 1860s , the weaving industry grew in villages in south @-@ west Wales , which did well until the 1920s . Skilled workers moved from mid @-@ Wales to the Teifi Valley , mainly to the area around Dre @-@ fach Felindre , <unk> , <unk> and Llandysul . A railway was opened from Carmarthen to Lampeter in 1864 , and large mills were developed such as the <unk> and <unk> factories at <unk> . Dre @-@ fach Felindre was once called " The Huddersfield of Wales " for its wool industry . The Cambrian Mills in this village made blankets , shawls , stockings and other products for local sale and for export . 
 The water @-@ powered factories in the south west were completely dependent on demand from the nearby South Wales coalfield , whose workers preferred Welsh goods . They could not compete with the mills of northern England in other markets . The Teifi Valley Railway , opened in 1895 , further strengthened the link from the rural south west to the industrial south . The woollen industry flourished in South Wales until the end of World War I ( 1914 – 18 ) , with high prices during the war . At one time there were more than 300 active woollen mills . 
 The woollen mills of the Teifi valley were hard @-@ hit by the drop in purchasing power of miners during the depression in the coal trade of the 1920s . In the inter @-@ war period ( 1918 – 39 ) most woollen manufacturers did not adapt to changes in fashion and were forced to close . Small clusters of hand loom weaving survived in places such as Lampeter where there were spinners and fullers , making quality goods . A weaver said of this work , " One can make a fair living by it , but a man can never get rich at it . " 
 The number of active mills dropped from 250 in 1926 to 81 in 1947 and 24 in 1974 , increasingly concentrated in industrial centres . However , the invention of the double weave and light tweeds caused significant growth in demand for Welsh textiles . When Burberry bought the Treorchy plant in the 1980s , 75 % of the workers were women . The plant was closed in March 2007 . 
 = = Today = = 
 As of 2013 there were just nine commercial woollen mills still in operation , often run by small families producing traditional Welsh cloth on old looms . Although demand for their products is high , there are few apprentices entering the industry . The Cambrian Woollen Mill at Dre @-@ fach Felindre was acquired by the state in 1976 for the Museum of the Welsh Woollen Industry , now named the National Wool Museum . Water powered woollen mills that were open to the public as of 2016 include Melin <unk> , Rock Mill Llandysul , Solva Woollen Mill and <unk> Woollen Mills . In 2016 the <unk> Cymru – National Museum Wales listed the following active woollen mills :

 Jamie McMurray led the drivers to the start of the race , but Jeff Gordon passed him before the first lap ended . Gordon maintained the lead until Brian Vickers overtook him on lap 38 . On the same lap , Dave Blaney went to the garage because of transmission problems . Seven laps later , the first caution was flown when Michael McDowell crashed into the wall in turn 2 . During the pit stops throughout the caution , McMurray made a pit stop quickly , leaving pit road first and leading at the subsequent restart . On lap 53 , Bobby Labonte and Joey Logano both spun sideways , bringing out the second caution . Most drivers did not pit ; McMurray led the drivers to the third green flag of the day . The third caution came out on lap 62 when Paul Menard turned sideways on the back straightaway . 
 The first 10 drivers did pit under this caution , so McMurray held onto his lead position on the restart . On lap 83 , a multiple car collision brought out the fourth caution .

 = Battle of Grand Port = 
 The Battle of Grand Port was a naval battle between squadrons of frigates from the French Navy and the British Royal Navy . The battle was fought during 20 – 27 August 1810 over possession of the harbour of Grand Port on Isle de France ( now Mauritius ) during the Napoleonic Wars . The British squadron of four frigates sought to blockade the port to prevent its use by the French through the capture of the fortified Île de la Passe at its entrance . This position was seized by a British landing party on 13 August , and when a French squadron under Captain Guy @-@ Victor Duperré approached the bay nine days later the British commander , Captain Samuel Pym , decided to lure them into coastal waters where his superior numbers could be brought to bear against the French ships . 
 Four of the five French ships managed to break past the British blockade , taking shelter in the protected anchorage , which was only accessible through a series of complicated reefs and sandbanks that were impassable without an experienced harbour pilot . When Pym ordered his frigates to attack the anchored French on August 22 and 23 , his ships became trapped in the narrow channels of the bay : two were irretrievably grounded ; a third , outnumbered by the combined French squadron , was defeated ; and a fourth was unable to close to within effective gun range . Although the French ships were also badly damaged , the battle was a disaster for the British : one ship was captured after suffering irreparable damage , the grounded ships were set on fire to prevent their capture by French boarding parties and the remaining vessel was seized as it left the harbour by the main French squadron from Port Napoleon under Commodore Jacques Hamelin . 
 The British defeat was the worst the Royal Navy suffered during the entire war , and it left the Indian Ocean and its vital trade convoys exposed to attack from Hamelin 's frigates . In response , the British authorities sought to reinforce the squadron on Île Bourbon under Josias Rowley by ordering all available ships to the region , but this piecemeal reinforcement resulted in a series of desperate actions as individual British ships were attacked by the more powerful and confident French squadron . In December 1810 an adequate reinforcement was collected , with the provision of a strong battle squadron under Admiral Albemarle Bertie , that rapidly invaded and subdued Isle de France . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the early nineteenth century , the Indian Ocean formed an essential part of the network of trade routes that connected the British Empire . Heavily laden East Indiamen travelled from British Indian port cities such as Bombay or Calcutta to the United Kingdom carrying millions of pounds worth of goods . From Britain , the ships returned on the same routes , often carrying soldiers for the growing British Indian Army , then under the control of the Honourable East India Company ( HEIC ) . Following the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803 , the British Admiralty had made the security of these routes a priority , and by 1807 the Dutch bases at the Cape of Good Hope and Java had been neutralised by expeditionary forces to prevent their use by enemy raiders . The French Indian Ocean possessions however , principally Île Bonaparte and Isle de France , were a more complicated target , protected from attack not only by the great distances involved in preparing an invasion attempt but also by heavy fortifications and a substantial garrison of French Army soldiers augmented by a large local militia . 
 The French had recognised the importance of these islands as bases for raiding warships during the French Revolutionary Wars ( 1793 – 1801 ) , but by late 1807 the only naval resources allocated to the region were a few older frigates and a large number of local privateers . Following the reduction of these remaining naval forces on Isle de France during 1808 , by defeat in battle and <unk> due to age and <unk> , the French naval authorities made a serious attempt to disrupt British trade in the region , ordering five large modern frigates to sail to Isle de France under Commodore Jacques Hamelin . Four of these ships broke through the British blockade of the French coast , arriving in the Indian Ocean in the spring of 1809 , where Hamelin dispersed them into the Bay of Bengal with orders to intercept , attack and capture or destroy the heavily armed but extremely valuable convoys of East Indiamen . The first French success came at the end of the spring , when the frigate Caroline successfully attacked a convoy at the Action of 31 May 1809 , seizing two heavily laden merchant ships . 
 Commodore Josias Rowley was given command of the British response to the French deployment , a hastily assembled force composed mainly of those ships available at the Cape of Good Hope in early 1809 . Ordered to stop the French raiders , Rowley was unable to spread his limited squadron wide enough to pursue the roving French frigates , instead using his forces to blockade and raid the French Indian Ocean islands in anticipation of Hamelin 's return . In August 1809 , Caroline arrived with her prizes at Saint @-@ Paul on Île Bonaparte and Rowley determined to seize the frigate . He planned a successful invasion of the town , launched on 20 September 1809 , which resulted in the capture of the port 's defences , Caroline and the captured East Indiamen . With his objectives complete , Rowley withdrew five days later . Almost a year later , Rowley returned with a larger task force and made a second landing around the capital of Île Bonaparte , Saint @-@ Denis . Marching on the seat of government , Rowley 's troops rapidly overwhelmed the defences and forced the island 's garrison to surrender , renaming the island Île Bourbon and installing a British governor . 
 Hamelin had used the British preoccupation with Île Bonaparte to send additional frigates to sea during 1809 and early 1810 , including his flagship Vénus , which captured three East Indiamen at the Action of 18 November 1809 , and Bellone , which took the Portuguese frigate Minerva in the Bay of Bengal a few days later . Minerva , renamed Minerve in French hands , was subsequently involved in the Action of 3 July 1810 , when a further two East Indiamen were captured . The squadron in the latter action was commanded by Guy @-@ Victor Duperré in Bellone , whose ships were so badly damaged that Duperré was forced to spend nearly a month repairing his vessels in the Comoros Islands before they were ready to return to Isle de France . 
 = = Operations off Grand Port = = 
 With Île Bourbon secured in July 1810 , the British now occupied a large fortified island base within easy sailing distance of Isle de France . Even before Île Bourbon was completely in British hands , Rowley had detached HMS Sirius from the invasion squadron with orders to restore the blockade of Isle de France . Shortly afterwards , Sirius 's captain Samuel Pym led his men in a raid on a coastal vessel moored off the southern side of the island . Two days after this successful operation , reinforcements arrived in the form of the frigates HMS Iphigenia , HMS Nereide and the small brig HMS Staunch . Nereide carried 100 specially selected soldiers from the 69th and 33rd Regiments and some artillerymen from the garrison at Madras , to be used in storming and garrisoning offshore islands , beginning with Île de la Passe off Grand Port , a well defended islet that protected a natural harbour on the southeastern shore . These fortified islands could be used to block entry to the ports of Isle de France and thus trap Hamelin 's squadron . 
 Grand Port was an easily defendable natural harbour because the bay was protected from the open sea by a large coral reef through which a complicated channel meandered , known only to experienced local pilots . Île de la Passe was vitally important in the control of Grand Port because it featured a heavy battery that covered the entrance to the channel , thus controlling the passage to the sheltered inner lagoon . The British planned to use the troops on Nereide , under her captain Nesbit Willoughby , to storm Île de la Passe and capture the battery . Willoughby would then use a local man serving on his ship named John Johnson ( known in some texts as " the black pilot " ) , to steer through the channel and land troops near the town , distributing leaflets promising freedom and prosperity under British rule in an attempt to corrode the morale of the defenders . 
 The first attack on Île de la Passe was launched on the evening of 10 August , with Staunch towing boats carrying over 400 soldiers , Royal Marines and volunteer sailors to the island under cover of darkness , guided by Nereide 's pilot . During the night however , the pilot became lost and the boats were scattered in high winds and had not reassembled by dawn . To distract French attention from the drifting boats , Pym directed Captain Henry Lambert in Iphigenia to sail conspicuously off Port Napoleon , where the main body of the French squadron , led by Hamelin in Vénus , was based . Pym joined Lambert later in the day and the frigates subsequently returned to the waters of Grand Port by different routes , confusing French observers from the shore as to British intentions . By 13 August , the boats originally intended for the attack had still not been assembled and Pym decided that he could not risk waiting any longer without the French launching a counterattack . Launching his own boats at 8pm ( local time ) , guided by the pilot and commanded by Pym 's second in command , Lieutenant Norman , Pym 's marines and sailors landed on the island in darkness under heavy fire from the defenders . Norman was killed in the initial exchange of fire , but his deputy Lieutenant Watling seized the island by storming the fortifications surrounding the battery . Seven British personnel were killed and 18 wounded in the battle , in which the storming party managed to seize intact French naval code books and took 80 prisoners . Willoughby was furious that Pym had assumed command of the operation without his permission and the officers exchanged angry letters , part of an ongoing disagreement between them that engendered mutual distrust . 
 With Île de la Passe secure , Pym gave command of the blockade of Grand Port to Willoughby and returned to his station off Port Napoleon with Iphigenia . Willoughby used his independent position to raid the coastline , landing at Pointe du Diable on 17 August on the northern edge of Grand Port with 170 men and storming the fort there , destroying 10 cannon and capturing another . Marching south towards the town of Grand Port itself , Willoughby 's men fought off French counterattacks and distributed propaganda pamphlets at the farms and villages they passed . Willoughby re @-@ embarked his troops in the evening but landed again the following day at Grande Rivière to observe the effects of his efforts . Burning a signal station , Willoughby advanced inland , but was checked by the arrival of 800 French reinforcements from Port Napoleon and returned to HMS Nereide . The brief expedition cost the British two men wounded and one missing , to French casualties of at least ten killed or wounded . Willoughby followed the attack on Grande Rivière with unopposed minor landings on 19 and 20 August . 
 = = Duperré 's arrival = = 
 Willoughby 's raiding was interrupted at 10 : 00 on 20 August when five ships were sighted , rapidly approaching from the southeast . These ships were Guy @-@ Victor Duperré 's squadron of Bellone , Minerve , corvette Victor and prizes Windham and Ceylon returning from the Comoros Islands . Following a month of repairs on Anjouan , Duperré had sailed for Isle de France without encountering any opposition on his return passage , and was intending to enter Grand Port via the channel protected by Île de la Passe . Duperré was unaware of the British occupation of the island , and Willoughby intended to lure the French squadron into the channel by concealing the British presence off the harbour . Once there , Willoughby hoped to defeat them or damage them so severely that they would be unable to break out unaided , thus isolating Duperré 's squadron from Hamelin 's force in Port Napoleon and containing the French in separate harbours to prevent them from concentrating against the British blockade squadrons . Willoughby brought Nereide close to Île de la Passe to combine their fire and protect his boats , which were carrying 160 men back to Nereide from a raid near Grand Port that morning . 
 Raising a French tricolour over Île de la Passe and on Nereide , Willoughby transmitted the French code captured on the island : " L <unk> <unk> au Coin de Mire " and received an acknowledgement from Duperré . The use of these signals convinced Duperré , over the objections of Captain Pierre Bouvet on Minerve , that Nereide was Surcouf 's privateer Charles , which was expected from France . The French squadron closed with the harbour during the morning , Victor entering the channel under Île de la Passe at 13 : 40 . As Victor passed Nereide and the fort Willoughby opened fire , Lieutenant Nicolas Morice surrendering the outnumbered corvette after the first volley . Willoughby sent boats to attempt to take possession of Victor , but they were unable to reach the vessel . Behind the corvette , Minerve and Ceylon pushed into the channel and signalled Morice to follow them , exchanging fire with the fort . As Morice raised his colours again and followed Minerve , a large explosion boiled out of Île de la Passe , where the false French flag had ignited on a brazier as it was lowered and set fire to a nearby stack of cartridges , which exploded in the close confines of the fort . Three men were killed and 12 badly burned , six cannon were dismounted and one discharged unexpectedly , killing a British sailor in a boat attempting to board Victor . With the fort out of action and a significant number of her crew scattered in small boats in the channel , Nereide alone was unable to block French entry to Grand Port . 
 With Willoughby 's ambush plan ruined , the scattered boats sought to rejoin Nereide , passing directly through the French squadron . Although several boats were in danger of being run down by the French ships and one even bumped alongside Minerve , all eventually rejoined Nereide safely . However , the opportunity to cause significant damage to the French in the narrow channel had been lost , Bellone joining the squadron in passing through the channel with minimal resistance . In addition to British losses in the explosion at the fort , two men had been killed and one wounded on Nereide . French losses were more severe , Minerve suffering 23 casualties and Ceylon eight . With both sides recognising that further action was inevitable , Willoughby sent a boat to Sirius requesting additional assistance and Duperré sent a message overland with Lieutenant Morice , requesting support from Hamelin 's squadron ( Morice fell from his horse during the mission and was severely injured ) . Command of Victor passed to Henri <unk> . In the afternoon , Willoughby used mortars on Île de la Passe to shell the French squadron , forcing Duperré to retreat into the shallow harbour at Grand Port and Willoughby subsequently sent officers into Grand Port on 21 August under a flag of truce , demanding the release of Victor , which he insisted had surrendered and should thus be handed over to the blockade squadron as a prize . Duperré refused to consider the request . One French ship had failed to enter the channel off Grand Port : the captured East Indiaman Windham . Early on 21 August , her French commander attempted to shelter in Rivière Noire . Sirius spotted the merchant ship under the batteries there and sent two boats into the anchorage , stormed the ship and brought her out without a single casualty . This success was remarkable as the boarding party had forgotten to take any weapons with them and were only armed with wooden foot @-@ stretchers wielded as clubs . 
 = = Battle = = 
 From prisoners captured on Windham , Pym learned of the nature and situation of Duperré 's squadron and sent orders to Port Napoleon with Captain Lucius Curtis in the recently arrived HMS Magicienne for Iphigenia to join Sirius and Nereide off Grand Port . Sirius and Nereide met on the morning of 22 August , Willoughby welcoming Pym with signals describing an " enemy of inferior force " . Although Duperré 's squadron was technically weaker than the four British frigates combined , Willoughby 's signal was misleading as the French had taken up a strong crescent shaped battleline in the bay and could cover the mouth of the channel through which the British ships could only pass one at a time . Duperré also anticipated the arrival of reinforcements from Port Napoleon under Governor Charles Decaen at any time and could call on the support of soldiers and gun batteries on shore . In addition , French launches had moved the buoys marking the channel through the coral reef to confuse any British advance . 
 = = = British attack = = = 
 On 22 August at 14 : 40 , Pym led an attack on Duperré 's squadron without waiting for Iphigenia and Magicienne , entering the channel that led to the anchorage at Grand Port . He was followed by Nereide , but Willoughby had refused to allow Pym to embark the harbour pilot : the only person in the British squadron who knew the passage through the reefs . Without guidance by an experienced pilot , Sirius was aground within minutes and could not be brought off until 08 : 30 on the 23 August . Nereide anchored nearby during the night to protect the flagship . At 10 : 00 , Iphigenia and Magicienne arrived and at 14 : 40 , after a conference between the captains as to the best course of action , the force again attempted to negotiate the channel . Although the squadron was now guided by Nereide 's pilot , Sirius again grounded at 15 : 00 and Magicienne 15 minutes later after over @-@ correcting to avoid the reef that Sirius had struck . Nereide and Iphigenia continued the attack , Iphigenia engaging Minerve and Ceylon at close range and Nereide attacking Bellone . Long @-@ range fire from Magicienne was also directed at Victor , which was firing on Nereide . 
 Within minutes of the British attack , Ceylon surrendered and boats from Magicienne sought but failed to take possession of her . The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore , joined shortly afterwards by Minerve , Bellone and later by Victor , so that by 18 : 30 the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire . Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position , and at 19 : 00 a cannon shot cut Nereide 's stern anchor cable . The British frigate swung around , presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron . <unk> by Bellone and desperate to return fire , Willoughby had the bow anchor cable cut , bringing a portion of his ship 's starboard broadside to bear on Bellone . At 20 : 00 , Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from a grape shot fired by Nereide ; Ensign <unk> concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone , placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve . Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore , Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire . He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of Minerve , and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway as to provide attachment points for additional guns , thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery . By 22 : 00 Nereide was a wreck , receiving shot from several sides , with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200 : the first lieutenant was dying , the second was severely wounded and Willoughby 's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter . Recognising her battered state , Bouvet then diverted fire from Nereide to concentrate on Magicienne . 
 Refusing to surrender until all options had been exhausted , Willoughby dispatched boats to Sirius , asking Pym if he believed it would be practical to send boats to tow Nereide out of range . Pym replied that with the boats engaged in attempting to tow Sirius and Magicienne off the reef it was not possible to deploy them under fire to tow Nereide . Pym also suggested that Willoughby disembark his men and set fire to his ship in the hope that the flames would spread to the French ships clustered on shore . Willoughby refused this suggestion as it was not practical to disembark the dozens of wounded men aboard Nereide in the growing darkness and refused to personally abandon his men when Pym ordered him to transfer to Sirius . At 23 : 00 , Willoughby ordered a boat to row to Bellone and notify the French commander that he had surrendered . However , Willoughby 's boat had been holed by shot and was unable to make the short journey . The message was instead conveyed by French prisoners from Nereide who had dived over board and reached the shore during the night . Recalling the false flags used on 20 August , Bouvet resolved to wait until morning before accepting the surrender . 
 = = = Attempted withdrawal = = = 
 At 01 : 50 on 24 August , Bellone ceased firing on the shattered Nereide . During the remaining hours of darkness , Pym continued his efforts to dislodge Sirius from the reef and sent orders to Lambert , whose Iphigenia had been blocked from firing on the French by Nereide and also prevented from pursuing the Minerve by a large reef blocking access to the beach . With Iphigenia now becalmed in the coastal waters , Pym instructed Lambert to begin warping his ship out of the harbour , using anchors attached to the capstan to drag the ship slowly through the shallow water . Magicienne , like Iphigenia , had been stranded out of range of the beached French ships and so had instead directed her fire against a battery erected on shore , which she had destroyed by 02 : 00 . When daylight rose , it showed a scene of great confusion , with Sirius and Magicienne grounded in the approaches to the harbour , the French ships " on shore in a heap " in the words of Captain Pym , Iphigenia slowly pulling herself away from the French squadron and Nereide lying broken and battered under the guns of Bellone , a Union Flag nailed to her masthead . This flag prompted a fresh burst of cannon fire from Bouvet , and it was not until Willoughby ordered the mizenmast to be chopped down that the French acknowledged the surrender and ceased firing . 
 At 07 : 00 , Lambert notified Pym that he had cleared the reef separating Iphigenia from the French ships and suggested that if Pym sent reinforcements from Sirius he might be able to board and capture the entire French squadron . Pym refused permission , insisting that Lambert assist him in pulling Sirius off the reef instead . Although Lambert intended to subsequently attack the French alone , Pym forbade him and sent a direct order for Lambert to move out of range of the enemy . At 10 : 00 , Iphigenia reached Sirius and together the ships began firing at French troops ashore , who were endeavouring to raise a gun battery within range of the frigates . Magicienne , irretrievably stuck on the reef , rapidly flooding and with her capstan smashed by French shot , now bore the brunt of long @-@ range French fire from both Bellone and the shore until Pym ordered Curtis to abandon his ship , transferring his men aboard Iphigenia . At 19 : 30 Magicienne was set on fire , her magazines exploding at 23 : 00 . On the shoreline , Duperré had been unable to spare any men to take possession of Nereide until 15 : 00 . A party under Lieutenant Roussin , second in command on Victor and temporarily in command of Minerve , was sent but had orders to return once the ship had been disarmed : freeing the remaining French prisoners , Roussin spiked the guns to prevent their further use , administered basic medical care and returned to shore , recounting that over 100 men lay dead or dying aboard the British frigate . 
 At 04 : 00 on 25 August , the newly erected French gun battery opened fire on Sirius and Iphigenia , which returned fire as best they could . Accepting that Sirius was beyond repair , Pym removed all her personnel and military supplies , setting fire to the frigate at 09 : 00 , shortly after Iphigenia had pulled beyond the range of the battery , using a cannon as an anchor after losing hers the previous day . French boats attempted to reach Sirius and capture her before she exploded , although they turned back when Pym launched his own boats to contest possession of the wreck . The frigate 's remaining munitions exploded at 11 : 00 . During the morning , Duperré sent an official boarding party aboard Nereide , who wet the decks to prevent any risk of fire from the ships burning in the harbour and removed 75 corpses from the frigate .

 When news of the arrival of Duperré 's squadron reached Decaen at Port Napoleon , he immediately despatched fast couriers to Grand Port and ordered Hamelin 's squadron , consisting of the frigates Vénus , Manche , Astrée and the brig Entreprenant , to make ready to sail in support of Duperré . Hamelin departed Port Napoleon at midnight on 21 August , intending to sail northeast and then south , down the island 's eastern shore . On 23 August , Hamelin 's squadron spotted and captured a British transport ship named Ranger , sent 24 days earlier from the Cape of Good Hope with 300 tons of food supplies and extensive naval stores for Rowley on Île Bourbon . On rounding the northern headlands of Isle de France , however , Hamelin found he could make no progress against the headwinds and reversed direction , passing the western shore of the island and arriving off Grand Port at 13 : 00 on 27 August . 
 The two extra days Hamelin had spent rounding Isle de France saw activity from the British forces remaining at Grand Port . There had been no strong winds in the bay and Iphigenia was forced to resort to slowly warping towards the mouth of the channel in the hope of escaping the approaching French reinforcements . Boats had removed the crews of Sirius and Magicienne to Île de la Passe , where the fortifications had been strengthened , but supplies were running low and Magicienne 's launch was sent to Île Bourbon to request urgent reinforcement and resupply from Rowley 's remaining squadron . On the morning of 27 August , Lambert discovered the brig Entreprenant off the harbour mouth and three French sail approaching in the distance . Iphigenia was still 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 3 ⁄ 4 mi ) from Île de Passe at the edge of the lagoon and was low on shot and unable to manoeuvre in the calm weather without anchors . Recognising that resistance under such conditions against an overwhelming force was futile , Lambert negotiated with Hamelin , offering to surrender Île de la Passe if Iphigenia and the men on the island were given permission to sail to Île Bourbon unmolested . 
 = = British surrender = = 
 On the morning of 28 August , Lambert received a message from Hamelin , promising to release all the prisoners under conditions of parole within one month if Île de la Passe and Iphigenia were both surrendered without resistance . The message also threatened that if Lambert refused , the French would attack and overwhelm the badly outnumbered British force . Recognising that food supplies were low , reinforcements had not arrived and that his ammunition stores were almost empty , Lambert agreed to the terms . Lambert later received a message from Decaen proposing similar terms and notified the French governor that he had surrendered to Hamelin . Decaen was furious that Hamelin had agreed terms without consulting him , but eventually agreed to accept the terms of the surrender as well . The wounded were treated by French doctors at Grand Port and later repatriated , although the remainder of the prisoners were placed in a cramped and unpleasant prison at Port Napoleon from which , despite the terms of the surrender , they were not released until British forces captured the island in December . 
 Rowley first learned of the operations off Grand Port on 22 August , when Windham arrived off Saint Paul . Eager to support Pym 's attack , Rowley immediately set sail in his frigate HMS Boadicea , with the transport Bombay following with two companies of the 86th Regiment of Foot to provide a garrison on any territory seized in the operation . The headwinds were strong and it was not until 29 August that Rowley arrived off Grand Port , having been notified of the situation there by Magicienne 's launch the previous day . Sighting a cluster of frigates around Île de la Passe , Rowley closed with the island before turning sharply when Vénus and Manche raised their colours and gave chase . Rowley repeatedly feinted towards the French ships and then pulled away , hoping to draw them away from Grand Port in the hope that Bombay might board the now unprotected Iphigenia and capture her . Bombay was thwarted by the reappearance of Astrée and Entreprenant and Rowley was chased by Vénus and Manche back to Saint Denis , anchoring there on 30 August . Rowley attempted a second time to rescue Iphigenia from Grand Port the following week , but by the time he returned Bellone and Minerve had been refloated and the French force was far too strong for Rowley 's flagship to attack alone . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battle is noted as the most significant defeat for the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars . Not only had four frigates been lost with their entire crews , but 105 experienced sailors had been killed and 168 wounded in one of the bloodiest frigate encounters of the war . French losses were also heavy , with Duperré reporting 36 killed and 112 wounded on his squadron and among the soldiers firing from the shore . 
 The loss of such a large proportion of his force placed Rowley at a significant disadvantage in September 1810 , as Hamelin 's squadron , bolstered by the newly commissioned Iphigénie , now substantially outnumbered his own ( the ruined Néréide was also attached to the French squadron , but the damage suffered was so severe that the ship never sailed again ) . Withdrawing to Isle de France , Rowley requested that reinforcements be diverted from other duties in the region to replace his lost ships and to break the French blockade of Île Bourbon , led by Bouvet . These newly arrived British frigates , cruising alone in unfamiliar waters , became targets for Hamelin , who twice forced the surrender of single frigates , only for Rowley to beat his ships away from their prize each time . On the second occasion , Rowley was able to chase and capture Hamelin and his flagship Vénus , bringing an end to his raiding career and to the activities of his squadron , who remained on Isle de France until they were all captured at the fall of the island in December 1810 by an invasion fleet under Vice @-@ Admiral Albemarle Bertie . 
 In France the action was greeted with celebration , and it became the only naval battle commemorated on the Arc de Triomphe . The British response was despondent , although all four captains were subsequently cleared and praised at their courts @-@ martial inquiring into the loss of their ships . The only criticism was of Willoughby , who was accused of giving a misleading signal in indicating that the French were of inferior force on 22 August . Contemporary historian William James described British reaction to the battle as " that the noble behaviour of her officers and crew threw such a halo of glory around the defeat at Grand Port , that , in public opinion at least , the loss of four frigates was scarcely considered a misfortune . " However , he also notes that " No case of which we are aware more deeply affects the character of the Royal Navy than the defeat it sustained at Grand Port . " On 30 December 1899 , a monument was erected at the harbour of Grand Port in the memory of the British and French sailors who were killed in the engagement .

 = Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg = 
 Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg ( 26 June 1760 – 25 March 1799 ) was an Austrian military commander . He achieved the rank of Field Marshal and died at the Battle of Stockach . 
 The third son of a cadet branch of the House of Fürstenberg , at his birth his chances of inheriting the family title of Fürst zu Fürstenberg were slight ; he was prepared instead for a military career , and a tutor was hired to teach him the military sciences . He entered the Habsburg military in 1777 , at the age of seventeen years , and was a member of the field army in the short War of the Bavarian Succession ( 1778 – 79 ) . His career progressed steadily during the Habsburg War with the Ottoman Empire . In particular he distinguished himself at Šabac in 1790 , when he led his troops in storming the fortress on the Sava River . 
 During the French Revolutionary Wars , he fought with distinction again for the First Coalition , particularly at <unk> and <unk> , and in 1796 at Emmendingen , Schliengen and Kehl . He was stationed at key points to protect the movements of the Austrian army . With a force of 10 @,@ 000 , he defended the German Rhineland at Kehl , and reversed a bayonet assault by French troops at <unk> ; his troops also overran Speyer without any losses . By the end of the War of the First Coalition , at the age of 35 , he had achieved the rank of Field Marshal . During the War of the Second Coalition , he fought in the first two battles of the German campaign , at Ostrach on 21 March 1799 , and at Stockach on 25 March 1799 . At the latter action while leading a regiment of grenadiers , he was hit by French case shot and knocked off his horse . He died shortly afterward . 
 = = Childhood and early military training = = 
 As the third son of a cadet ( junior ) branch of the Fürstenberg princely family , Karl Aloys was prepared for a military career . His tutor , Lieutenant Ernst , was in active service in the Habsburg military , and took six @-@ year @-@ old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with him . In this way , he learned as a child the Habsburg military manual , and came into contact with important military men who later furthered his education and career ; he also acquired an honorary rank as Kreis @-@ <unk> , or Colonel of the Imperial Circle , by the time he was ten years old . As a youth , in 1776 , he met the Habsburg war minister Count Franz Moritz von Lacy and Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon ; he was also invited to dine with Emperor Joseph II . He started his service in 1777 as a Fähnrich ( ensign ) in the Habsburg military organization . He saw his first field service during the War of the Bavarian Succession ( 1777 – 78 ) , although he was not involved in any battles . 
 In 1780 , at the age of twenty years , he was promoted to captain , and assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment , also known as the Anton Esterházy , named for Paul II Anton Esterházy , the general of cavalry , field marshal of the Seven Years ' War , and ambassador to Britain . While he was assigned to this unit , he participated in the border conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburgs , 1787 – 92 , and stormed the fortress at Šabac ( German : <unk> ) on the Sava River in Serbia on 27 April 1788 . For his action at Šabac , he was personally commended by the Emperor ; on the following day , he was promoted to major and given command of a grenadier battalion . 
 On 1 January 1790 , at Laudon 's explicit request , Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was promoted to major general ; at the end of June of that year , he received the coveted position of second colonel of the 34th Infantry Regiment Anton Esterhazy , where he served as the executive officer for Antal , Prince Esterházy de Galántha , the 34th Hungarian Regiment 's Colonel and Proprietor . This was a customary appointment in which a less prominent officer completed the day @-@ to @-@ day administrative duties of the Colonel and Proprietor , who was usually a noble and was often posted in a different assignment , sometimes a different staff location . Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg also received the confraternal Order of Saint Hubert from the Duke of Bavaria and married the " elegant " Princess Elisabeth of Thurn und Taxis ( 1767 – 1822 ) , that year . 
 = = Fight against Revolutionary France = = 
 While Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg fought for the Habsburg cause in Serbia , in France , a coalition of the clergy and the professional and bourgeois class — the First and Third estates — led a call for reform of the French government and the creation of a written constitution . Initially , the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as an event between the French king and his subjects , and not something in which they should interfere . In 1790 , Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791 , he considered the situation surrounding his sister , Marie Antoinette , and her children , with greater alarm . In August 1791 , in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia , he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz , in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family . They threatened ambiguous , but quite serious , consequences if anything should happen to the royal family . The French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter @-@ revolution . On 20 April 1792 , the French National Convention declared war on Austria . In the War of the First Coalition ( 1792 – 1797 ) , France opposed most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her , plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire . 
 = = = War of the First Coalition = = = 
 In the early days of the French Revolutionary Wars , Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg remained as brigade commander of a small Austrian corps , approximately 10 @,@ 000 men , under the overall command of Anton , Prince Esterházy . He was stationed in the Breisgau , a Habsburg territory between the Black Forest and the Rhine River . This location between the forested mountains and the river included two important bridgeheads across the river which offered access to southwestern Germany , the Swiss Cantons , or north @-@ central Germany . His brigade defended Kehl , a small village immediately across the Rhine from Strassbourg , but most of the action in 1792 occurred further north , in present @-@ day Belgium , near the cities of Speyer and Trier , and at Frankfurt on the Main River . 
 In the second year of the war , Fürstenberg was transferred to the cavalry of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser , in the Army of the Upper Rhine , and placed in charge of the advance guard near Speyer , which was still held by the French . On 30 March , he crossed the Rhine by <unk> at the head of the advance guard , which included 9 @,@ 000 men . He took the city of Speyer on 1 April , in the absence of the commander of the city , Adam @-@ Philippe de Custine , who was away with most of his troops ; those that remained behind simply abandoned the city . On the following day , Fürstenberg occupied the town of <unk> . His first combat action of the war occurred on 3 April , when Custine 's infantry attacked him in a bayonet charge near the villages of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and afterward at Landau and <unk> . During these attacks , he lost all the ground he had gained in the days before . After these events , he was again transferred , this time to the command of the Regiment Count von Kavanagh , where he continued to distinguish himself during the French counter @-@ offensive of October – November 1793 . In the action around <unk> , on the Zorn River , he assisted Lieutenant Field Marshal Gabriel Anton , Baron <unk> de <unk> , in repelling a French counter @-@ attack . Shortly afterward , he became very ill and , in December 1793 , was sent to the <unk> to recover . On 22 December , he rejoined Wurmser 's Corps for the Battle of <unk> against Lazare Hoche and Charles Pichegru . After the French retreated over the Rhine at Hüningen , near Basel , he directed the construction of its new fortifications . 
 In June 1796 , Fürstenberg commanded a division of four infantry battalions , 13 artillery pieces , and the Freikorps ( Volunteers ) <unk> and secured the Rhine corridor between Kehl and Rastatt . On 26 June 1796 , the French troops of the Army of the Rhine @-@ and @-@ Moselle crossed the Rhine and chased the Swabian Circle 's military contingent out of Kehl . In June 1796 , Archduke Charles added the contingent to Fürstenberg 's command , making him the Swabian 's Feldzeugmeister , or General of Infantry . Fürstenberg 's troops defended the imperial line at the town of Rastatt until support troops arrived , and they could make an orderly withdrawal into the Upper Danube Valley . The Swabian contingent was demobilized in July , and Fürstenberg returned to the command of Austrian regulars during the Austrian counter @-@ offensive . At the Battle of Emmendingen on 19 October 1796 , his leadership was again instrumental in an Austrian victory . General Jean Victor Marie Moreau 's Army of the Rhine @-@ and @-@ Moselle sought to retain a foothold on the eastern side of the Rhine , following his retreat from southwestern Germany west of the Black Forest . Fürstenberg held <unk> , 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 km ) north of Riegel on the Elz River . Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was ordered to feint against Riegel , to protect the primary Austrian positions at Rust and Kappel . 
 In the Battle of Schliengen ( 24 October 1796 ) , Fürstenberg commanded the second column of the Austrian force , which included nine battalions of infantry and 30 squadrons of cavalry ; with these , he overwhelmed the force of General of Division Gouvion Saint @-@ Cyr , holding his position to prevent the French force from retreating north on the Rhine . While Maximilian Anton Karl , Count Baillet de Latour , engaged the main Austrian force at Kehl , Archduke Charles entrusted to Lieutenant Field Marshal Fürstenberg the command of the forces besieging Hüningen , which included two divisions with 20 battalions of infantry and 40 squadrons of cavalry . Charles ' confidence in his young field marshal was well @-@ placed . On 27 November , Fürstenberg 's chief engineer opened and drained the water @-@ filled moat protecting the French fortifications . Fürstenberg offered the commander of the bridgehead , General of Brigade Jean Charles Abbatucci , the opportunity to surrender , which he declined . In the night of 30 November to 1 December , Fürstenberg 's force stormed the bridgehead twice , but was twice repulsed . In one of these attacks , the French commander was mortally wounded and died on 3 December . Fürstenberg maintained the Siege of Kehl while Archduke Charles engaged the stronger French force to the north of Kehl . 
 After the French capitulation at Kehl ( 10 January 1797 ) , Fürstenberg received additional forces with which he could end the siege at Hüningen . He ordered the reinforcement of the ring of soldiers surrounding Hüningen and , on 2 February 1797 , the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead . General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour , the new French commander , pre @-@ empted what would have been a costly attack , by offering to surrender the bridge . On 5 February , Fürstenberg finally took possession of the bridgehead . Francis II , the Holy Roman Emperor , appointed him as Colonel and Proprietor of the 36th Infantry Regiment , which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799 . 
 = = = Peace = = = 
 The Coalition forces — Austria , Russia , Prussia , Great Britain , Sardinia , among others — achieved several victories at Verdun , Kaiserslautern , Neerwinden , Mainz , Amberg and Würzburg , but in northern Italy , they could neither lift nor escape the siege at Mantua . The efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands . Napoleon dictated a cease @-@ fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797 , leading to the formal Treaty of Campo Formio , which went into effect on 17 October 1797 . Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought so hard to acquire , including the strategic river crossings at Hüningen and Kehl , as well as key cities further north . 
 When the war ended , Fürstenberg stayed at the Donaueschingen estate of his cousin , Karl Joachim Aloys , who had recently inherited the family title as Fürst zu Fürstenberg . Later in 1797 , he traveled to Prague and remained with his family until May 1798 , when he received a posting to a new division in Linz . His daughter , Maria Anna , was born after he left , on 17 September 1798 . 
 = = Activities in the Second Coalition = = 
 Despite the longed @-@ for peace , tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies , either separately or jointly . Ferdinand IV of Naples refused to pay agreed @-@ upon tribute to France , and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion . The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopaean Republic . A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons , encouraged by the French Republic which offered military support , led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic . On his way to Egypt in Spring 1798 , Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and removed the Hospitallers from their possessions . This angered Paul , Tsar of Russia , who was the honorary head of the Order . The ongoing French occupation of Malta angered the British , who dedicated themselves to ejecting the French garrison at Valletta . The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war . Indeed , the weaker the French Republic seemed , the more seriously the Austrians , the Neapolitans , the Russians , and the British actually discussed this possibility . 
 As winter broke on 1 March 1799 , General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his 25 @,@ 000 @-@ man Army of the Danube crossed the Rhine at Kehl . The Army of the Danube met little resistance as it advanced through the Black Forest and eventually took a flanking position on the north shore of Lake Constance . Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes , Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy , and prevent them from assisting one another . His was a preemptive strike . By crossing the Rhine in early March , Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles ' army could be reinforced by Austria 's Russian allies , who had agreed to send 60 @,@ 000 seasoned soldiers and their more @-@ seasoned commander , Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov . Furthermore , if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland , they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany , but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters . 
 = = = Battle of Ostrach = = = 
 At the outbreak of hostilities in March 1799 , Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was with his troops in Bavarian territory , just north of the free and Imperial city of Augsburg . When news reached the Austrian camp that the French had crossed the Rhine , Charles ordered the imperial army to advance west . Fürstenberg moved his troops toward Augsburg , crossing the Lech River . 
 The French advanced guard arrived in Ostrach on 8 – 9 March , and over the next week skirmished with the Austrian forward posts , while the rest of the French army arrived . Jourdan disposed his 25 @,@ 000 troops along a line from Salem Abbey and Lake Constance to the Danube river , centered in Ostrach . He established his command headquarters at the imperial city of Pfullendorf , overlooking the entire Ostrach valley . Jourdan was expecting Dominique Vandamme 's troops to arrive in time to support his far north flank near the river , but Vandamme had gone to Stuttgart to investigate a rumored presence of Austrian troops there and had not rejoined the main army . Consequently , the French left flank , under command of Gouvion Saint @-@ Cyr , was thinly manned . Jourdan thought he had more time , expecting Charles would need still three or four days to move his troops across the Lech , and march to Ostrach , but by the middle of Holy Week in 1799 , more than a third of Charles ' army , 48 @,@ 000 mixed troops , was positioned in a formation parallel to Jourdan 's , and his 72 @,@ 000 remaining troops were arrayed with the left wing at Kempten , the center near Memmingen , and the right flank extended to Ulm . 
 By 21 March , the French and Austrian outposts overlapped , and skirmishing intensified . Charles had divided his force into four columns . Fürstenberg covered the northern flank of the Archduke 's main force . Fürstenberg 's force pushed the French out of <unk> , and then advanced on <unk> and Einhard , 5 kilometers ( 3 mi ) to the northwest of Ostrach . Saint @-@ Cyr did not have the manpower to defend the position , and the entire line fell back to Ostrach , with Fürstenberg 's troops pressuring their withdrawal . Fürstenberg 's persistent pressure on the French left flank was instrumental in the collapse of the northern part of the French line . After their success in driving the French back from Ostrach , and then from the heights of Pfullendorf , the Austrian forces continued to press the French back to Stockach , and then another five miles or so to Engen . 
 = = = Death at the Battle of Stockach ( 1799 ) = = = 
 On the morning of what they suspected would be the general engagement , Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain , and requested the sacraments because , as he told his aide , anything can happen during a battle . Although Ostrach had been a hard @-@ fought battle , at Engen and Stockach , the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated — more men in a smaller space — than they had been at Ostrach , where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the Danube . At Stockach , furthermore , Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control , with the possible exception of Dominique Vandamme , who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank . 
 In the course of the battle , Jourdan 's forces were supposed to engage in simultaneous attacks on the left , center and right of the Austrian line . On the French right , Soulham 's and Ferino 's Corps met with strong resistance and were stopped ; on the French left , Lefebvre 's troops charged with such force that the Austrians were pushed back . Having stopped Soulham 's and Ferino 's assault , Charles had troops available to counter Lefebvre 's force . At that point , Vandamme 's men moved into action . Because Soulham 's assault at the center had been stalled , Charles still had enough men to turn part of his force to fight this new threat , but the Austrians were hard pressed and the action furious . At one point , Charles attempted to lead his eight battalions of Hungarian grenadiers into action , to the dismay of the old soldiers . Fürstenberg reportedly said that while he lived , he would not leave this post ( at the head of the grenadiers ) and the Archduke should not dismount and fight . As Fürstenberg led the Hungarian grenadiers into the battle , he was cut down by a canister and case shot employed by the French . Although he was carried alive off the field , he died almost immediately . Charles ultimately did lead his grenadiers into battle , and reportedly his personal bravery rallied his troops to push back the French . After the battle , someone removed Fürstenberg 's wedding ring and returned it to his wife in Prague , with news of his death ; Fürstenberg was buried at the battlefield cemetery in Stockach , and his cousin erected a small monument there , but in 1857 , his body was moved to the family cemetery , Maria Hof at <unk> , near Donaueschingen . 
 = = Family = = 
 Upon the death of Prosper Ferdinand , Count Fürstenberg , in the War of the Spanish Succession , in 1704 the Fürstenberg inheritance was divided between the count 's two youngest sons , Joseph Wilhelm Ernst and Wilhelm Egon ; the eldest son was an ecclesiastic . The family of Fürstenberg was raised to princely status 2 February 1716 , with the elevation of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst , as the first Prince ( Fürst ) of Fürstenberg ( German : Fürst zu Fürstenberg ) . The first prince had three sons , Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk ( 1728 – 1783 ) , Karl Borromäus Egon ( 1729 – 1787 ) , and Prosper Maria , who died in infancy . The title passed through the line of the first son , Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk ( as second prince ) , to his son Joseph Maria Benedikt Karl ( third prince , who died in 1796 ) and then to another son of the second prince , Karl Joachim Aloys ( fourth prince ) . The last son of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst died in 1803 without male issue . Consequently , the title passed to the male line of first prince 's second son . This son , Karl Borromäus Egon , had died in 1787 . 
 Karl Borromäus Egon 's oldest son , Joseph Maria Wenzel ( 16 August 1754 – 14 July 1759 ) , died as a small child . The second son , Philipp <unk> Maria ( Prague , 21 October 1755 – 5 June 1790 ) , married in 1779 to his first cousin , Josepha Johanna <unk> von Fürstenberg ( sister of the third and fourth princes ) , at Donaueschingen . Only one of their sons survived childhood , but died at the age of 15 years . The other children of this second son were all daughters , and thus not eligible to inherit the title Prince of Fürstenberg . Consequently , the title devolved to the agnatic male descendants of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg . 
 In 1803 , two of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg 's children were still living . Karl Egon , as the surviving son , inherited the title Prince of Fürstenberg ; he and his eldest sister lived into adulthood and produced families . 
 Children of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and Elizabeth , Princess of Thurn und Taxis , were : 
 Marie <unk> ( Prague , 4 September 1791 – <unk> , 10 January 1844 ) ; married at Heiligenberg , 20 May 1813 to Charles Albert III , Prince of Hohenlohe @-@ Waldenburg @-@ <unk> ( Vienna , 29 February 1776 – Bad <unk> , 15 June 1843 ) 
 Maria Josepha ( 9 September 1792 ) 
 Antonie ( 28 October 1794 – 1 October 1799 ) 
 Karl Egon II ( Prague , 28 October 1796 – Bad Ischl 22 October 1854 ) , succeeded his cousin , Joachim , as the fifth Fürst zu Fürstenberg on 17 May 1804 . He married on 19 April 1818 , to Amalie Christine Karoline , of Baden ( Karlsruhe , 26 January 1795 – Karlsruhe , 14 September 1869 ) .

 = Gliese 876 c = 
 Gliese 876 c is an exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876 , taking about 30 days to complete an orbit . The planet was discovered in April 2001 and is the third planet in order of increasing distance from its star . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 At the time of discovery , Gliese 876 was already known to host an extrasolar planet designated Gliese 876 b . In 2001 , further analysis of the star 's radial velocity revealed the existence of a second planet in the system , which was designated Gliese 876 c . The orbital period of Gliese 876 c was found to be exactly half that of the outer planet , which meant that the radial velocity signature of the second planet was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of Gliese 876 b . 
 = = Orbit and mass = = 
 Gliese 876 c is in a 1 : 2 : 4 Laplace resonance with the outer planets Gliese 876 b and Gliese 876 e : for every orbit of planet e , planet b completes two orbits and planet c completes four . This leads to strong gravitational interactions between the planets , causing the orbital elements to change rapidly as the orbits precess . This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance , the first being Jupiter 's moons Io , Europa and Ganymede . 
 The orbital semimajor axis is only 0 @.@ 13 AU , around a third of the average distance between Mercury and the Sun , and is more eccentric than the orbit of any of the major planets of our solar system . Despite this , it is located in the inner regions of the system 's habitable zone , since Gliese 876 is such an intrinsically faint star . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet 's mass can be obtained . This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit , which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements . However , in a resonant system such as Gliese 876 , gravitational interactions between the planets can be used to determine the true masses . Using this method , the inclination of the orbit can be determined , revealing the planet 's true mass to be 0 @.@ 72 times that of Jupiter . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Based on its high mass , Gliese 876 c is likely to be a gas giant with no solid surface . Since it was detected indirectly through its gravitational effects on the star , properties such as its radius , composition , and temperature are unknown . Assuming a composition similar to Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium , the planet is predicted to have a cloudless upper atmosphere . 
 Gliese 876 c lies at the inner edge of the system 's habitable zone . While the prospects for life on gas giants are unknown , it might be possible for a large moon of the planet to provide a habitable environment . Unfortunately tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon , the planet , and the star could destroy moons massive enough to be habitable over the lifetime of the system . In addition it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place . 
 This planet , like b and e , has likely migrated inward . 
 = Lamu Fort = 
 Lamu Fort is a fortress in the town of Lamu in northeastern Kenya . Originally situated on the waterfront , the fort today it is located in a central position in the town , about 70 metres ( 230 ft ) from the main jetty on the shore . The powerfully built two @-@ story stone building contrasts with the Swahili architecture of the other buildings in the town . 
 Lamu Fort was built between 1813 and 1821 with Omani assistance . Initially it provided a base from which the Omanis consolidated their control of the East African coast but the town later lost its economic importance . During the British colonial period , and after the independence of Kenya , the fort was used as a prison . Today it houses an environmental museum and library , and is often used for community events . 
 = = Building = = 
 Lamu Fort is a defensive structure that was erected at the southeast corner of the old stone town of Lamu . The fort was built beside the <unk> Mosque , the oldest known mosque in Lamu , with origins in the 14th century . The fort originally lay on the waterfront , which then ran along the main street of the town but has since retreated . 
 Thomas Boteler , who visited Lamu in 1823 , described the fort as " a large square building , with a tower at each corner , but constructed so slightly that in all probability the discharge of its honeycombed ordnance would soon bring the whole fabric to the ground . " It had a " large vaulted entrance ... [ and ] consisted of three stories of balconies , supported inside by arches . Captain W. F. W. Owen , who visited at the same time , noted that the fort was " one hundred yards square , and surrounded by walls from forty to fifty feet high . " 
 Today the fort is in a central position in the town . It is situated about 70 metres ( 230 ft ) from the main jetty on the shore . The fort today is a massive two @-@ story stone building . The squat and powerful structure contrasts with the elegant Swahili architecture of the other buildings in the town . 
 = = History = = 
 Construction of the fort appears to have been started by <unk> , Sultan of Pate . The <unk> leader Abdalla bin <unk> , in an uneasy alliance with Pate , was also involved in the construction . One story was built , but with the death of <unk> in 1809 construction halted . In 1812 Lamu gained an unexpected victory at the Battle of <unk> over the forces of Pate and Mombasa . The continued threat prompted them to call for help from Oman . Said bin Sultan , Sultan of Muscat and Oman ( r . 1804 – 1856 ) , was said to have assisted in the renewed construction , which began in 1813 and was completed around 1821 . 
 Sultan Sayyid Said bin Sultan sent a governor to Lamu around 1814 . He provided a protective garrison of Baluchi soldiers . According to Boteler , the main guard consisted of " about twenty Muscat soldiers , lounging on the stone benches on either side , with eye intent on vacancy , and armed with their shields , swords and pikes . A large assortment of matchlocks , suspended from the walls above them , resembled those used by the primitive small @-@ arm men in England . " However , the security offered by the fort encouraged construction around it during the 19th century , including a shopfront . 
 The importance of Lamu in the Lamu Archipelago grew at the expense of Pate in the years that followed the fort 's construction . The Sultan used Lamu Fort as a base for defeating the <unk> rebels in Mombasa , and for establishing control over the East African coast . He moved the capital of his sultanate to Zanzibar . With its strategic importance lost , Lamu soon declined in economic importance in comparison to Mombasa and Zanzibar . 
 Lamu Fort was turned into a prison in 1910 by the British colonial administration . In the 1950s Mau Mau detainees were held in the fort . The fort continued to be used as a prison after the independence of Kenya until 1984 . It was then given to the National Museums of Kenya , who converted the fort into a museum with help from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency . The Lamu Fort was declared a scheduled monument on 15 May 1984 . Restoration was undertaken carefully . A temporary exhibition was opened in 1993 . 
 The fort today includes a museum with an exhibition on the ground floor mainly concerned with environmental conservation . The courtyard is used by the local community for meetings , weddings and public performances . There are offices , laboratories and a workshop on the second floor , and a conference facility that is available for rent . The fort houses a library with an excellent collection of Swahili poetry and reference material on Lamu . The ramparts of the fort give panoramic views of the town . 
 = Emin Xhinovci = 
 Emin Xhinovci ( also spelled <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; born c . 1959 ) is a retired Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) insurgent and restaurant owner from Mitrovica known for his striking resemblance to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler . 
 He immigrated to Germany in 1993 and settled in Düsseldorf , where he started an import @-@ export business . In 1997 , he returned to Kosovo and later joined the KLA with the intention of helping separate the region from Yugoslavia . During his time as a guerrilla , he came to be known by the nickname " Hitler " because of his likeness to the Nazi leader . Following the Kosovo War , he settled in Mitrovica and opened a string of Nazi @-@ themed restaurants that angered some NATO peacekeepers and were quickly closed . Xhinovci firmly believes that he is Hitler reincarnated and resorted to portraying the Nazi leader full @-@ time in his public life , posing for pictures with locals , peacekeepers and tourists and charging between 20 and 80 euros per photograph . He is well known throughout Mitrovica , and his five daughters are referred to by locals as " Hitler 's children " . Xhinovci always carries a copy of Hitler 's autobiographical manifesto Mein Kampf with him and is frequently paid to attend events such as weddings and funerals . He is the subject of a short documentary film directed by independent filmmaker Alban <unk> , titled Germans Are a Bit Scared of Me . 
 = = Early life , emigration and guerrilla activity = = 
 A Kosovo Albanian , Emin Xhinovci was born in Kosovska Mitrovica in 1959 , in what was then Yugoslavia . In 1993 , he moved to the German city of Düsseldorf , where he started an import @-@ export business . He left Germany in 1997 and returned to Kosovo to " fight for the motherland " as tensions between Albanians and Serbs increased . 
 Xhinovci joined the Kosovo Liberation Army ( Albanian : <unk> <unk> e <unk> ; or KLA ) in 1998 , and fought against the Serb @-@ dominated Yugoslav Army ( Serbian : Vojska Jugoslavije ) with the goal of separating Kosovo from Yugoslavia . Xhinovci earned the reputation of a " fierce fighter " and commanded the respect of local Albanians . His comrades gave him the nickname " Hitler " due to his uncanny resemblance to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler . Xhinovci told journalist Una <unk> : " People have called me Hitler since my army days . They say I look a lot like him — unlike the English guy who plays him in that movie , " apparently a reference to Charlie Chaplin 's role in The Great Dictator . 
 Serbian police documents from 1998 indicate that he was suspected of participating in the kidnapping and execution of nine Serb mineworkers at the <unk> coal mine , near Obilić . In 1999 , Xhinovci was wounded in battle and airlifted to Germany for treatment . While in hospital , he grew a toothbrush moustache which attracted the attention of hospital staff . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 = = = Nazi @-@ themed restaurants and bars = = = 
 Following his experience with the German hospital staff , Xhinovci realized that he could capitalize on his resemblance to Hitler . He went to great lengths to enhance his physical likeness to the Nazi leader — regularly clipping his moustache , dying his hair jet black and imitating Hitler 's signature hairstyle . When the war in Kosovo ended , Xhinovci returned to Mitrovica and opened a bar called Bar Hit and Jet , known affectionately among Kosovo Albanians as Pizzeria Hitleri ( " Hitler 's Pizzeria " ) . The establishment proved controversial among western peacekeepers who had occupied Kosovo following the withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces in June 1999 . In one instance , French NATO troops took down a sign carrying a swastika from the entrance to Xhinovci 's bar , much to his displeasure . One French commander told reporters that he was disgusted with Xhinovci 's actions and said that his troops were forbidden from entering the bar , which juxtaposed Nazi imagery with portraits of Xhinovci in KLA uniform . Asked why he enjoyed dressing up as Hitler , Xhinovci responded : " Everyone who is against the people who carried out bloodshed against [ Albanians ] is a friend of mine " , apparently referring to the German @-@ led Axis occupation of Yugoslavia , when German forces turned a blind eye to Albanian raids on Serb @-@ populated areas of Kosovo . He conceded that Hitler had gone " too far " by killing women and children , but said that it would be " a good idea to eliminate all those who thirst for our blood " . 
 Within several years , Xhinovci was forced to close Pizzeria Hitleri because local KLA commanders felt that it would tarnish the organization 's image . Like many in post @-@ war Kosovo , he encountered great financial difficulties and relied on his KLA service pension and financial assistance from relatives in Western Europe . Once his financial situation stabilized , Xhinovci opened a restaurant and named it <unk> after his oldest daughter . All of the restaurant 's receipts were stamped with a black swastika in the upper left corner . The restaurant closed a few years after its opening for reasons unknown . 
 = = = Hitler impersonator = = = 
 Following the closure of Pizzeria Hitleri and <unk> , Xhinovci has resorted to walking around Mitrovica dressed as Hitler and posing for pictures with locals , tourists and NATO peacekeepers , charging between 20 and 80 euros per photograph . Some days , he earns as many as 200 euros posing as Hitler . Besides posing for photographs , Xhinovci attends various events , including weddings and funerals , and greets attendees with a Nazi salute . " [ This ] sometimes has an undesirable effect because people who 've come to pay their respects to the deceased often wish to speak with me and take pictures , " Xhinovci explains . 
 Xhinovci has come to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began dressing as the Nazi leader . He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him , including Nazi @-@ era Reichsmarks , swastika @-@ emblazoned buttons , scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery , as well as a copy of Mein Kampf . He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word " Hitler " printed in bold . Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci 's Hitler impersonations , especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country 's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought . On the contrary , many passersby — including some NATO peacekeepers — stop and greet him with the Nazi salute . One local told Vice News : " I have a lot of other things to worry about in my life . I might look at him if he walks by , but that 's it . " Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living " shows great enterprise " . " People respect me , " Xhinovci explains . " The young and old [ ... ] men , women and children . Everyone greets me with " Heil Hitler " . Xhinovci 's five daughters , referred to locally as " Hitler 's children " , are not bothered by their father 's Hitler impersonations . Xhinovci reportedly attends parent @-@ teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance . He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures . " Girls like to touch my face . They think it 's a mask . They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face . When I 'm out of the house with my family , people stop to talk to me . But my wife is not a jealous person — she doesn 't mind . " 
 Xhinovci is unable to return to Germany because of his appearance , as the country has a series of laws which prohibit Nazi symbols , uniforms , slogans and forms of greeting . He has expressed a great dislike of Serbs , and says that he would have to carry a concealed handgun every time he wished to visit the Serb @-@ held section of Mitrovica . Xhinovci says that he is greatly disappointed with post @-@ war Kosovo , as he believed that reconciliation between Albanians and Serbs would have occurred after the conflict . When asked if it was difficult to portray Hitler , Xhinovci responded : " It is easy . I find myself in Hitler 's character because he fought against my enemy . The enemy of my enemy is my friend . Yes , Serbs are my enemies . " About his physical similarity to Hitler , he says : " I am not a dictator like him , but it is of great financial benefit that I resemble him . " 
 Xhinovci is a controversial figure in some Kosovar circles . <unk> <unk> , a Pristina @-@ based German @-@ language newspaper , called his actions " scandalous and unacceptable " .

 = George VI = 
 George VI ( Albert Frederick Arthur George ; 14 December 1895 – 6 February 1952 ) was King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth from 11 December 1936 until his death . He was the last Emperor of India and the first Head of the Commonwealth . 
 Known as Albert until his accession , George VI was born in the reign of his great @-@ grandmother Queen Victoria , and was named after his great @-@ grandfather Albert , Prince Consort . As the second son of King George V , he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother , Edward . He attended naval college as a teenager , and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War . In 1920 , he was made Duke of York . He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes @-@ Lyon in 1923 and they had two daughters , Elizabeth and Margaret . In the mid @-@ 1920s , he had speech therapy for a stammer , which he never fully overcame . 
 George 's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936 . However , later that year Edward revealed his desire to marry the divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson . British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin advised Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king . Edward abdicated in order to marry , and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the House of Windsor . 
 During George 's reign the break @-@ up of the British Empire and its transition into the Commonwealth of Nations accelerated . The parliament of the Irish Free State removed direct mention of the monarch from the country 's constitution on the day of his accession . The following year , a new Irish constitution changed the name of the state to Ireland and established the office of President . From 1939 , the Empire and Commonwealth – except Ireland – was at war with Nazi Germany . War with Italy and Japan followed in 1940 and 1941 , respectively . Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945 , the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre @-@ eminent world powers and the British Empire declined . After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 , George remained king of both countries , but the title Emperor of India was abandoned in June 1948 . Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949 , and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year . George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth . He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign . He was succeeded by his elder daughter , Elizabeth . 
 = = Early life = = 
 George VI was born at York Cottage , on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk , during the reign of his great @-@ grandmother Queen Victoria . His father was Prince George , Duke of York ( later King George V ) , the second and eldest @-@ surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales ( later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra ) . His mother was the Duchess of York ( later Queen Mary ) , the eldest child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck . 
 His birthday ( 14 December 1895 ) was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great @-@ grandfather , Prince Albert , the Prince Consort . Uncertain of how the Prince Consort 's widow , Queen Victoria , would take the news of the birth , the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been " rather distressed " . Two days later , he wrote again : " I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her " . Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert , and wrote to the Duchess of York : " I am all impatience to see the new one , born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me , especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good " . Consequently , he was baptised " Albert Frederick Arthur George " at St. Mary Magdalene 's Church near Sandringham three months later . As a great @-@ grandson of Queen Victoria , he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth . Within the family , he was known informally as " Bertie " . His maternal grandmother , the Duchess of Teck , did not like the first name the baby had been given , and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name " may supplant the less favoured one " . 
 Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth , after his grandfather , father and elder brother , Edward . In 1898 , Queen Victoria issued Letters Patent that granted the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales the style Royal Highness , and at the age of two , Albert became His Royal Highness Prince Albert of York . 
 He often suffered from ill health and was described as " easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears " . His parents were generally removed from their children 's day @-@ to @-@ day upbringing , as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era . He had a stammer that lasted for many years , and was forced to write with his right hand although he was naturally left @-@ handed . He suffered from chronic stomach problems as well as knock knees , for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints . 
 Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901 , and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII . Prince Albert moved up to third in line to the throne , after his father and elder brother . 
 = = Military career and education = = 
 From 1909 , Albert attended the Royal Naval College , Osborne , as a naval cadet . In 1911 , he came bottom of the class in the final examination , but despite this he progressed to the Royal Naval College , Dartmouth . When his grandfather , Edward VII , died in 1910 , Albert 's father became King George V. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales , and Albert was second in line to the throne . 
 Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship HMS Cumberland in the West Indies and on the east coast of Canada . He was rated as a midshipman aboard HMS Collingwood on 15 September 1913 , and spent three months in the Mediterranean . His fellow officers gave him the nickname " Mr. Johnson " . One year after his commission , he began service in the First World War . He was mentioned in despatches for his action as a turret officer aboard Collingwood in the Battle of Jutland ( 31 May – 1 June 1916 ) , an indecisive engagement with the German navy that was the largest naval action of the war . He did not see further combat , largely because of ill health caused by a duodenal ulcer , for which he had an operation in November 1917 . 
 In February 1918 , he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the Royal Naval Air Service 's training establishment at Cranwell . With the establishment of the Royal Air Force two months later and the reassignment of Cranwell from Admiralty to Air Ministry responsibility , Albert transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force . He was appointed Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys ' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918 , before reporting to the RAF 's Cadet School at St Leonards @-@ on @-@ Sea where he completed a fortnight 's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing . He was the first member of the royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot . 
 Albert was greatly desirous of serving on the Continent while the war was still in progress and was very pleased to be posted to General Trenchard 's staff . On 23 October he flew across the Channel to <unk> . For the closing weeks of the war , he served on the staff of the RAF 's Independent Air Force at its headquarters in Nancy , France . Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918 , he remained on the Continent for two months as a staff officer with the Royal Air Force until posted back to Britain . He accompanied the Belgian monarch King Albert on his triumphal reentry into Brussels on 22 November . Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and gained a promotion to squadron leader on the following day . 
 In October 1919 , Albert went up to Trinity College , Cambridge , where he studied history , economics and civics for a year , with the historian R. V. Laurence as his " official mentor " . On 4 June 1920 , he was created Duke of York , Earl of Inverness and Baron Killarney . He began to take on more royal duties . He represented his father , and toured coal mines , factories , and railyards . Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the " Industrial Prince " . His stammer , and his embarrassment over it , together with his tendency to shyness , caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother , Edward . However , he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis . He played at Wimbledon in the Men 's Doubles with Louis Greig in 1926 , losing in the first round . He developed an interest in working conditions , and was President of the Industrial Welfare Society . His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 In a time when royals were expected to marry fellow royals , it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife . An infatuation with the already @-@ married Australian socialite Sheila , Lady Loughborough , came to an end in April 1920 when the King , with the promise of the dukedom of York , persuaded Albert to stop seeing her . That year , he met for the first time since childhood Lady Elizabeth Bowes @-@ Lyon , the youngest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne . He became determined to marry her . She rejected his proposal twice , in 1921 and 1922 , reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family . In the words of Lady Elizabeth 's mother , Albert would be " made or marred " by his choice of wife . After a protracted courtship , Elizabeth agreed to marry him . 
 They were married on 26 April 1923 in Westminster Abbey . Albert 's marriage to someone not of royal birth was considered a modernising gesture . The newly formed British Broadcasting Company wished to record and broadcast the event on radio , but the Abbey Chapter vetoed the idea ( although the Dean , Herbert Edward Ryle , was in favour ) . Lady Elizabeth was styled " Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York " after their marriage . 
 From December 1924 to April 1925 , the Duke and Duchess toured Kenya , Uganda , and the Sudan , travelling via the Suez Canal and Aden . During the trip , they both went big game hunting . 
 Because of his stammer , Albert dreaded public speaking . After his closing speech at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925 , one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners , he began to see Lionel Logue , an Australian @-@ born speech therapist . The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises , and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently . Subsequently , he was able to speak with less hesitation . With his delivery improved , the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra , Australia , during a tour of the empire in 1927 . His journey by sea to Australia , New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica , where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man , which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races . 
 The Duke and Duchess of York had two children : Elizabeth ( called " Lilibet " by the family ) , and Margaret . The Duke and Duchess and their two daughters lived a relatively sheltered life at their London residence , 145 Piccadilly . They were a close and loving family . One of the few stirs arose when the Canadian Prime Minister , R. B. Bennett , considered the Duke for Governor General of Canada in 1931 — a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs , J. H. Thomas . 
 = = Reluctant king = = 
 King George V had severe reservations about Prince Edward , saying , " I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne . " On 20 January 1936 , George V died and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII . In the Vigil of the Princes , Prince Albert and his three brothers took a shift standing guard over their father 's body as it lay in state , in a closed casket , in Westminster Hall . 
 As Edward was unmarried and had no children , Albert was the heir presumptive to the throne . Less than a year later , on 11 December 1936 , Edward abdicated in order to marry his mistress , Wallis Simpson , who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second . Edward had been advised by British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex @-@ husbands . Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans . Thus Albert became king , a position he was reluctant to accept . The day before the abdication , he went to London to see his mother , Queen Mary . He wrote in his diary , " When I told her what had happened , I broke down and sobbed like a child . " 
 On the day of the abdication , the Oireachtas , the parliament of the Irish Free State , removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution . The next day , it passed the External Relations Act , which gave the monarch limited authority ( strictly on the advice of the government ) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties . The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth . 
 Courtier and journalist Dermot <unk> alleged that there was brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing Albert ( and his children ) and his brother , Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester , in favour of their younger brother Prince George , Duke of Kent . This seems to have been suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with a son . 
 = = Early reign = = 
 Albert assumed the regnal name " George VI " to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy . The beginning of George VI 's reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother , whose titles , style and position were uncertain . He had been introduced as " His Royal Highness Prince Edward " for the abdication broadcast , but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles , including " Royal Highness " . In settling the issue , George 's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title and style " His Royal Highness The Duke of Windsor " , but the Letters Patent creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles . George VI was also forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House , as these were private properties and did not pass to George VI automatically . Three days after his accession , on his 41st birthday , he invested his wife , the new queen consort , with the Order of the Garter . 
 George VI 's coronation took place on 12 May 1937 , the date previously intended for Edward 's coronation . In a break with tradition , Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a show of support for her son . There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI , as had occurred for his father , as the cost would have been a burden to the government of India . Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal couple would have received likely to be muted at best , and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War . Two overseas tours were undertaken , to France and to North America , both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war . 
 The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI . The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's appeasement of Hitler . However , when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938 , they invited him to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with them . This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional , as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family . While broadly popular among the general public , Chamberlain 's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons , which led historian John Grigg to describe the King 's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as " the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century " . 
 In May and June 1939 , the King and Queen toured Canada and the United States . From Ottawa , the royal couple were accompanied throughout by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , to present themselves in North America as King and Queen of Canada . George was the first reigning monarch of Canada to visit North America , although he had been to Canada previously as Prince Albert and as Duke of York . Both Governor General of Canada Lord <unk> and Mackenzie King hoped that the King 's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the Statute of Westminster 1931 , which gave full sovereignty to the British Dominions . On 19 May , George VI personally accepted and approved the Letter of Credence of the new U.S. Ambassador to Canada , Daniel Calhoun Roper ; gave Royal Assent to nine parliamentary bills ; and ratified two international treaties with the Great Seal of Canada . The official royal tour historian , Gustave Lanctot , wrote " the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality " and George gave a speech emphasising " the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth " . 
 The trip was intended to soften the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe . Although the aim of the tour was mainly political , to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war , the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public . The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor , Edward VIII , was dispelled . They visited the 1939 New York World 's Fair and stayed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and at his private estate at Hyde Park , New York . A strong bond of friendship was forged between the King and Queen and the President during the tour , which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 In September 1939 , Britain and the self @-@ governing Dominions , but not Ireland , declared war on Nazi Germany . George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London , despite German bombing raids . They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war , although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle . The first German raid on London , on 7 September 1940 , killed about one thousand civilians , mostly in the East End . On 13 September , the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there . In defiance , the Queen famously declared : " I am glad we have been bombed . It makes me feel we can look the East End in the face " . The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations as the rest of the country . They were subject to rationing restrictions , and U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded @-@ up Palace . In August 1942 , the King 's brother , Prince George , Duke of Kent , was killed on active service . 
 In 1940 , Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister , though personally George would have preferred to appoint Lord Halifax . After the King 's initial dismay over Churchill 's appointment of Lord Beaverbrook to the Cabinet , he and Churchill developed " the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister " . Every Tuesday for four and a half years from September 1940 , the two men met privately for lunch to discuss the war in secret and with frankness . 
 Throughout the war , the King and Queen provided morale @-@ boosting visits throughout the United Kingdom , visiting bomb sites , munitions factories , and troops . The King visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939 , North Africa and Malta in June 1943 , Normandy in June 1944 , southern Italy in July 1944 , and the Low Countries in October 1944 . Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place as symbols of national resistance . At a social function in 1944 , Chief of the Imperial General Staff Sir Alan Brooke , revealed that every time he met Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery he thought he was after his job . The King replied : " You should worry , when I meet him , I always think he 's after mine ! " 
 In 1945 , crowds shouted " We want the King ! " in front of Buckingham Palace during the Victory in Europe Day celebrations . In an echo of Chamberlain 's appearance , the King invited Churchill to appear with the royal family on the balcony to public acclaim . 
 In January 1946 , George addressed the United Nations at their first assembly , which was held in London , and reaffirmed " our faith in the equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small " . 
 = = Empire to Commonwealth = = 
 George VI 's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the British Empire . The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate sovereign states . The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states , known as the Commonwealth , gathered pace after the Second World War . During the ministry of Clement Attlee , British India became the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan in 1947 . George relinquished the title of Emperor of India , and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead . In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations , but he remained King of Pakistan until his death and India recognised his new title of Head of the Commonwealth . Other countries left the Commonwealth , such as Burma in January 1948 , Palestine ( divided between Israel and the Arab states ) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949 . 
 In 1947 , the King and his family toured Southern Africa . The Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa , Jan Smuts , was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit . George was appalled , however , when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites , and referred to his South African bodyguards as " the Gestapo " . Despite the tour , Smuts lost the election the following year , and the new government instituted a strict policy of racial segregation . 
 = = Illness and death = = 
 The stress of the war had taken its toll on the King 's health , exacerbated by his heavy smoking and subsequent development of lung cancer among other ailments , including arteriosclerosis and <unk> obliterans . A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after the King suffered an arterial blockage in his right leg , which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right lumbar <unk> in March 1949 . His elder daughter Elizabeth , the heir presumptive , took on more royal duties as her father 's health deteriorated . The delayed tour was re @-@ organised , with Elizabeth and her husband , the Duke of Edinburgh , taking the place of the King and Queen . The King was well enough to open the Festival of Britain in May 1951 , but on 23 September 1951 , his left lung was removed by Clement Price Thomas after a malignant tumour was found . In October 1951 , Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month @-@ long tour of Canada ; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King 's illness . At the State Opening of Parliament in November , the King 's speech from the throne was read for him by the Lord Chancellor , Lord Simonds . His Christmas broadcast of 1951 was recorded in sections , and then edited together . 
 On 31 January 1952 , despite advice from those close to him , the King went to London Airport to see off Princess Elizabeth , who was going on her tour of Australia via Kenya . On the morning of 6 February , George VI was found dead in bed at Sandringham House in Norfolk . He had died from a coronary thrombosis in his sleep at the age of 56 . His daughter Elizabeth flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II . 
 From 9 February for two days his coffin rested in St. Mary Magdalene Church , Sandringham , before lying in state at Westminster Hall from 11 February . His funeral took place at St. George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , on the 15th . He was interred initially in the Royal Vault until he was transferred to the King George VI Memorial Chapel inside St. George 's on 26 March 1969 . In 2002 , fifty years after his death , the remains of his widow , Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother , and the ashes of his younger daughter Princess Margaret , who both died that year , were interred in the chapel alongside him . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In the words of Labour Member of Parliament George Hardie , the abdication crisis of 1936 did " more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda " . George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed " a rocking throne " , and tried " to make it steady again " . He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb . During his reign his people endured the hardships of war , and imperial power was eroded . However , as a dutiful family man and by showing personal courage , he succeeded in restoring the popularity of the monarchy . 
 The George Cross and the George Medal were founded at the King 's suggestion during the Second World War to recognise acts of exceptional civilian bravery . He bestowed the George Cross on the entire " island fortress of Malta " in 1943 . He was posthumously awarded the Ordre de la Libération by the French government in 1960 , one of only two people ( the other being Churchill ) to be awarded the medal after 1946 . 
 There are a number of geographical features , roads , and institutions named after George VI . These include King George Hospital in London ; King George VI Reservoir in Surrey , United Kingdom ; King George VI Highway and King George Boulevard in Surrey , British Columbia ; Kingsway in Edmonton ; George VI Sound in Antarctica ; and the King George VI Chase , a horse race in the United Kingdom .

 Wesley Kanne Clark , Sr. ( born December 23 , 1944 ) is a retired General of the United States Army . He graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1966 at West Point and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford , where he obtained a degree in Philosophy , Politics and Economics . He later graduated from the Command and General Staff College with a master 's degree in military science . He spent 34 years in the Army , receiving many military decorations , several honorary knighthoods , and the Presidential Medal of Freedom . 
 Clark commanded Operation Allied Force in the Kosovo War during his term as the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO from 1997 to 2000 . 
 Clark joined the 2004 race for the Democratic Party presidential nomination as a candidate in 2003 , but withdrew from the primary race in 2004 , after winning the Oklahoma state primary , endorsing and campaigning for the eventual Democratic nominee , John Kerry . Clark leads a political action committee , " <unk> " , which he formed after the 2004 primaries and used to support Democratic Party candidates in the 2006 midterm elections . Clark was considered a potential candidate for the Democratic nomination in 2008 , but , on September 15 , 2007 , endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton . After Clinton dropped out of the presidential race , Clark endorsed the then @-@ presumptive Democratic nominee , Barack Obama . Clark serves as the co @-@ chairman of Growth Energy , an ethanol lobbying group , and is on the board of directors of <unk> Petroleum . Since July 2012 , he also acts as an honorary special advisor to Romanian prime minister Victor Ponta on economic and security matters . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Clark 's father 's family was Jewish ; his paternal great @-@ grandfather immigrated to the United States from Belarus in response to the Pale of Settlement and anti @-@ Semitic violence from Russian pogroms . Clark 's grandfather , Jacob Kanne , graduated from the Chicago @-@ Kent College of Law and served in the U.S. Naval Reserve as an ensign during World War I , although he was never assigned to a combat mission . Kanne , living in Chicago , became involved with ward politics in the 1920s as a prosecutor and served in local offices . He served as a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention that nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt as the party 's presidential candidate ( though his name does not appear on the published roll of convention delegates ) . His mother was of English ancestry and was a Methodist . 
 Kanne came from the Kohen family line , and Clark 's son has characterized Clark 's parents ' marriage , between his Methodist mother , Veneta ( née <unk> ) , and his Jewish father , Benjamin Jacob Kanne , as " about as multicultural as you could 've gotten in 1944 " . 
 Clark was born Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23 , 1944 . His father Benjamin died on December 6 , 1948 ; his mother then moved the family to Little Rock , Arkansas . This move was made for a variety of reasons , including escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago , the support Veneta 's family in Arkansas could provide , and her feeling of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion . Once in Little Rock , Veneta married Viktor Clark , whom she met while working as a secretary at a bank . Viktor raised Wesley as his son , and officially adopted him on Wesley 's 16th birthday . Wesley 's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark . Viktor Clark 's name actually replaced that of Wesley 's biological father on his birth certificate , something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done . Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti @-@ Semitic activities of the Ku Klux Klan in the South . Although his mother was Methodist , Clark chose a Baptist church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood . 
 He graduated from Hall High School with a National Merit Scholarship . He helped take their swim team to the state championship , filling in for a sick teammate by swimming two legs of a relay . Clark has often repeated the anecdote that he decided he wanted to go to West Point after meeting a cadet with glasses who told Clark ( who wore glasses as well ) that one did not need perfect vision to attend West Point as Clark had thought . Clark applied , and he was accepted on April 24 , 1962 . 
 = = Military career = = 
 Clark 's military career began July 2 , 1962 , when he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point , New York . He later said that Douglas MacArthur 's famous " Duty , honor , country " speech was an important influence on his view of the military . The speech was given to the class of 1962 several months before Clark entered West Point , but a recording was played for his class when they first arrived . 
 Clark sat in the front in many of his classes , a position held by the highest performer in class . Clark participated heavily in debate , was consistently within the top 5 % of his class as a whole ( earning him a " Distinguished Cadet " patch on his uniform ) and graduated as valedictorian of West Point . The valedictorian is first to choose which career field of the Army to serve in , and Clark selected armor . He met Gertrude Kingston , whom he later married , at a USO dance for midshipmen and West Point cadets . 
 Clark eventually applied for a Rhodes Scholarship and learned in December of his senior year at West Point that he had been accepted . He spent his summer at the United States Army Airborne School at Fort Benning , Georgia . He worked in the Philosophy , Politics , and Economics ( PPE ) program during his Rhodes Scholarship , completing his degree at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in August 1968 . While he was at Oxford , a Jewish cousin of Clark 's who lived in England telephoned him and informed him of his Jewish heritage , having received permission from Veneta Clark . Clark spent three months after graduation at Fort Knox , Kentucky , going through Armor Officer Basic Course , then went on to Ranger School at Fort Benning . He was promoted to captain and was assigned as commander of the A Company of the 4th Battalion , 68th Armor , 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg , North Carolina . 
 = = = Vietnam = = = 
 Clark was assigned a position in the 1st Infantry Division and flew to Vietnam on May 21 , 1969 , during the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War . He worked as a staff officer , collecting data and helping in operations planning , and was awarded the Bronze Star for his work with the staff . Clark was then given command of A Company , 1st Battalion , 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970 . In February , only one month into his command , he was shot four times by a Viet Cong soldier with an AK @-@ 47 . The wounded Clark shouted orders to his men , who counterattacked and defeated the Viet Cong force . Clark had injuries to his right shoulder , right hand , right hip , and right leg , and was sent to Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville , Pennsylvania , to recuperate . He was awarded the Silver Star and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his actions during the encounter . 
 Clark had converted to Catholicism , his wife Gertrude 's religion , while in Vietnam . He saw his son , Wesley Clark , Jr . , for the first time while at the Valley Forge Hospital . Clark commanded C Company , 6th Battalion , 32nd Armor , 194th Armored Brigade , a company composed of wounded soldiers , at Fort Knox . Clark has said this command is what made him decide to continue his military career past the five @-@ year commitment required by West Point , which would have concluded in 1971 . Clark completed his Armor Officer Advanced Course while at Fort Knox , taking additional elective courses and writing an article that won the Armor Association Writing Award . His next posting was to the office of the Army Chief of Staff in Washington , D.C. , where he worked in the " Modern Volunteer Army " program from May to July 1971 . He then served as an instructor in the Department of Social Sciences at West Point for three years from July 1971 to 1974 . 
 Clark graduated from the Command and General Staff College ( CGSC ) , earning his military Master of Arts degree in military science from the CGSC with a thesis on American policies of gradualism in the Vietnam War . Clark 's theory was one of applying force swiftly , which was being advocated by many soldiers at the time , a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. national security policy in the form of the Weinberger Doctrine and its successor , the Powell Doctrine . Clark was promoted to major upon his graduation from the CGSC . 
 = = = Post @-@ Vietnam = = = 
 In 1975 , Clark was appointed a White House Fellow in the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) as a special assistant to its director , James Thomas Lynn . He was one of 14 appointed out of 2 @,@ 307 applicants . Lynn also gave Clark a six @-@ week assignment to assist John Marsh , then a counselor to the President . Clark was approached during his fellowship to help push for a memorial to Vietnam veterans . He worked with the movement that helped lead to the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington , D.C. Clark served in two commands with the 1st Armored Division based in Germany from August 1976 to February 1978 , first as S @-@ 3 of the 3rd Battalion 35th Armor and then as S @-@ 3 of the entire 3rd Brigade . Clark 's brigade commander while in the former position said Clark was " singularly outstanding , notably superb . " Regarding his term as brigade commander , one of his battalion commanders called Clark the " most brilliant and gifted officer [ he 'd ] ever known . " He was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for his work with the division . 
 The brigade commander had also said that " word of Major Clark 's exceptional talent spread " , and in one case reached the desk of then Supreme Allied Commander Alexander Haig . Haig personally selected Clark to serve as a special assistant on his staff , a post he held from February 1978 to June 1979 . While on staff at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe ( SHAPE ) , Clark wrote policy reports and coordinated two multinational military exercises . As a result of his work on Haig 's staff , Clark was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was awarded the Legion of Merit . After his European post , he moved on to Fort Carson , Colorado , where he served first as the executive officer of the 1st Brigade , 4th Infantry Division from August 1979 to February 1980 , then as the commander of the 1st Battalion , 77th Armor , 4th Infantry Division from February 1980 to July 1982 . According to the American journalist David Halberstam , the commander at Fort Carson , then Major General John <unk> , had a reputation of disliking West Point graduates and fast @-@ rising officers such as Clark . After two years of not making the list to rise from battalion commander to brigade commander , Clark attended the National War College . After studying there from June 1982 to 1983 , Clark graduated and was promoted to full colonel in October 1983 . 
 Following his graduation , Clark worked in Washington , D.C. , from July 1983 to 1984 in the offices of the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army , earning a second Legion of Merit for his work . He then served as the Operations Group commander at the Fort Irwin Military Reservation from August 1984 to June 1986 . He was awarded another Legion of Merit and a Meritorious Service Medal for his work at Fort Irwin and was given a brigade command at Fort Carson in 1986 . He commanded the 3rd Brigade , 4th Infantry Division there from April 1986 to March 1988 . Veneta Clark , Wesley 's mother , fell ill as he began this command and died on Mother 's Day in 1986 . After Fort Carson , Clark returned to the Command and General Staff College to direct and further develop the Battle Command Training Program ( <unk> ) there until October 1989 . The <unk> was created to teach senior officers war @-@ fighting skills , according to the commanding general at the time . On November 1 , 1989 , Clark was promoted to brigadier general . 
 Clark returned to Fort Irwin and commanded the National Training Center ( NTC ) from October 1989 to 1991 . The Gulf War occurred during Clark 's command , and many National Guard divisional round @-@ out brigades trained under his command . Multiple generals commanding American forces in Iraq and Kuwait said Clark 's training helped bring about results in the field and that he had successfully begun training a new generation of the military that had moved past Vietnam @-@ era strategy . He was awarded another Legion of Merit for his " personal efforts " that were " instrumental in maintaining " the NTC , according to the citation . He served in a planning post after this , as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Concepts , Doctrine , and Developments at Training and Doctrine Command ( <unk> ) at Fort Monroe , Virginia . While there , he helped the commanding general of <unk> prepare the army for war and develop new post @-@ Cold War strategies . Clark pushed for technological advancement in the army to establish a digital network for military command , which he called the " digitization of the battlefield . " He was promoted to Major General in October 1992 at the end of this command . 
 = = = = Fort Hood and the Waco Siege = = = = 
 Clark 's divisional command came with the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood , Texas . Clark was in command during three separate deployments of forces from Fort Hood for peacekeeping in Kuwait . 
 Some critics , such as left @-@ wing <unk> and right @-@ wing <unk> , have made allegations that Clark was , to some degree , involved in the Waco siege , where David Koresh and 74 Branch Davidian followers were killed during the FBI 's final raid on the group 's compound . Some also suggest that , given the sensitive nature of the materials lent for the operation , Clark had some knowledge of and perhaps a hand in planning the Waco siege . Others , such as James Ridgeway , dismiss the allegations as having " little evidence to substantiate them . " 
 His Officer Evaluation Report ( <unk> ) for his command at Fort Hood called him " one of the Army 's best and brightest " . Clark was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his work at Fort Hood and was promoted to lieutenant general at the end of his command in 1994 . Clark 's next assignment was an appointment as the Director , Strategic Plans and Policy ( J5 ) , on the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) , from April 1994 to June 1996 . 
 = = = = United States Southern Command = = = = 
 Army regulations set a so @-@ called " ticking clock " upon the promotion to a three @-@ star general , essentially requiring that Clark be promoted to another post within 2 years from his initial promotion or retire . This deadline ended in 1996 and Clark said he was not optimistic about receiving such a promotion because rumors at the time suggested General Dennis Reimer did not want to recommend him for promotion although " no specific reason was given " . According to Clark 's book , General Robert Scales said that it was likely Clark 's reputation of intelligence within the military was responsible for feelings of resentment against him from other generals . Clark was named to the United States Southern Command ( USSOUTHCOM ) post despite these rumors . Congress approved his promotion to full general in June 1996 , and General John M. Shalikashvili signed the order . Clark said he was not the original nominee , but the first officer chosen " hadn 't been accepted for some reason . "

 Clark began planning work for responses to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina upon his appointment in 1994 as the Director , Strategic Plans and Policy ( J5 ) on the JCS staff . While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict , Clark met with Bosnian Serb military leaders including Ratko Mladić , who was later accused of war crimes and genocide . Clark was photographed exchanging hats with Mladić , and the photo drew controversy in the United States . A Washington Post story was published claiming Clark had made the visit despite a warning from the U.S. ambassador . Some Clinton administration members privately said the incident was " like cavorting with Hermann Göring . " Clark listed the visit in the itinerary he submitted to the ambassador , but he learned only afterwards that it was not approved . He said there had been no warning and no one had told him to cancel the visit , although two Congressmen called for his dismissal regardless . Clark later said he regretted the exchange , and the issue was ultimately resolved as President Clinton sent a letter defending Clark to the Congress and the controversy subsided . Clark said it was his " first experience in the rough and tumble of high visibility ... and a painful few days . " Conservative pundit Robert Novak later referred to the hat exchange in a column during Clark 's 2004 presidential campaign , citing it as a " problem " with Clark as a candidate . 
 Clark was sent to Bosnia by Secretary of Defense William Perry to serve as the military advisor to a diplomatic negotiating team headed by assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke . Holbrooke later described Clark 's position as " complicated " because it presented him with future possibilities but " might put him into career @-@ endangering conflicts with more senior officers . " While the team was driving along a mountain road during the first week , the road gave way , and one of the vehicles fell over a cliff carrying passengers including Holbrooke 's deputy , Robert Frasure , a deputy assistant Secretary of Defense , Joseph <unk> , and Air Force Colonel Nelson Drew . Clark and Holbrooke attempted to crawl down the mountain , but were driven back by sniper fire . Once the fire ceased , Clark rappelled down the mountain to collect the bodies of two dead Americans left by Bosnian forces that had taken the remaining wounded to a nearby hospital . Following funeral services in Washington , D.C. , the negotiations continued and the team eventually reached the Dayton Agreement at the Wright @-@ Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton , Ohio , and later signed it in Paris on December 14 , 1995 . 
 Clark returned to the European theater and the Balkans following his USSOUTHCOM position when he was appointed to U.S. European Command in the summer of 1997 by President Clinton . He was , as with <unk> , not the original nominee for the position . The Army had already selected another general for the post . Because President Clinton and General Shalikashvili believed Clark was the best man for the post , he eventually received the nomination . Shalikashvili noted he " had a very strong role in [ Clark 's ] last two jobs . " Clark noted during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services committee of the 105th Congress that he believed NATO had shifted since the end of the Cold War from protecting Europe from the Soviet Union to working towards more general stability in the region . Clark also addressed issues related to his then @-@ current command of USSOUTHCOM , such as support for the School of the Americas and his belief that the United States must continue aid to some South American nations to effectively fight the War on Drugs . Clark was quickly confirmed by a voice vote the same day as his confirmation hearing , giving him the command of 109 @,@ 000 American troops , their 150 @,@ 000 family members , 50 @,@ 000 civilians aiding the military , and all American military activities in 89 countries and territories of Europe , Africa , and the Middle East . The position made Clark the Supreme Allied Commander Europe ( SACEUR ) , which granted him overall command of NATO military forces in Europe . 
 = = = = Kosovo War = = = = 
 The largest event of Clark 's tenure as SACEUR was NATO 's confrontation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War . On September 22 , 1998 , the United Nations Security Council introduced Resolution 1199 calling for an end to hostilities in Kosovo , and Richard Holbrooke again tried to negotiate a peace . This process came to an unsuccessful end , however , following the <unk> massacre . Then U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried to force Yugoslavia into allowing separation of Kosovo with the Rambouillet Agreement , which Yugoslavia refused . Clark was at the Rambouillet talks and tried to convince Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević by telling him " there 's an activation order . And if they tell me to bomb you , I 'm going to bomb you good . " Clark later said Milošević launched into an emotional tirade against Albanians and said that they 'd been " handled " in the 1940s by ethnic cleansing . 
 Clark started the bombings codenamed Operation Allied Force on March 24 , 1999 , on orders to try to enforce U.N. Resolution 1199 following Yugoslavia 's refusal of the Rambouillet Agreement . However , critics note that Resolution 1199 was a call for cessation of hostilities and does not authorize any organization to take military action . Secretary of Defense William Cohen felt that Clark had powerful allies at the White House , such as President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , who allowed him to circumvent The Pentagon in promoting his strategic ideas . Clark felt , however , that he was not being included enough in discussions with the National Command Authority , leading him to describe himself as " just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States " . This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was not initially invited to a summit in Washington , D.C. , to commemorate NATO 's 50th anniversary , despite being its supreme military commander . Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit , but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops , and Clark agreed . 
 Clark returned to SHAPE following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations . A reporter from the Los Angeles Times asked a question about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces , and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milošević 's true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements . Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said " distorted the comment " with headlines such as " NATO Chief <unk> Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations " in The New York Times . Clark later defended his remarks , saying this was a " complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts , " and President Clinton agreed that Clark 's remarks were misconstrued . Regardless , Clark received a call the following evening from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton , who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim : " Get your fucking face off the TV . No more briefings , period . That 's it . " 
 Operation Allied Force experienced another problem when NATO bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on May 7 , 1999 . The operation had been organized against numerous Serbian targets , including " Target 493 , the Federal Procurement and Supply Directorate Headquarters " , although the intended target building was actually 300 meters away from the targeted area . The embassy was located at this mistaken target , and three Chinese journalists were killed . Clark 's intelligence officer called Clark taking full responsibility and offering to resign , but Clark declined , saying it was not the officer 's fault . Secretary Cohen and CIA Director George Tenet took responsibility the next day . Tenet would later explain in testimony before the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on July 22 , 1999 , that the targeting system used street addresses , which gave inaccurate positions for air bombings . He also said that the various databases of off @-@ limit targets did not have the up @-@ to @-@ date address for the relatively new embassy location . 
 The bombing campaign was ended on June 10 , 1999 , on the order of Secretary General of NATO Javier Solana after Milošević complied with conditions the international community had set and Yugoslav forces began to withdraw from Kosovo . United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 was adopted that same day , placing Kosovo under United Nations administration and authorizing a Kosovo peacekeeping force . NATO suffered no combat deaths , although two crew members died in an Apache helicopter crash . A F @-@ 117A was downed near the village of <unk> . The bombing resulted in an estimated 495 civilian deaths and 820 wounded , as reported to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia . Yugoslavia estimated that the number of civilians killed is higher than 2 @,@ 000 and that more than 5 @,@ 000 have been wounded . Human Rights Watch estimates the number of civilian deaths due to NATO bombings as somewhere between 488 and 527 . 
 Milošević 's term in office in Yugoslavia was coming to an end , and the elections that came on September 24 , 2000 , were protested due to allegations of fraud and rigged elections . This all came to a head on October 5 in the so @-@ called Bulldozer Revolution . Milošević resigned on October 7 . The Democratic Opposition of Serbia won a majority in parliamentary elections that December . Milošević was taken into custody on April 1 , 2001 , and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on June 28 to face charges of war crimes and genocide . Clark was called to testify in a closed session of Milošević 's trial in December 2003 . He testified on issues ranging from the Srebrenica massacre to conversations Clark had had with Milošević during his career . Some anti @-@ war activist groups also label Clark and Bill Clinton ( along with several others ) as war criminals for NATO 's entire bombing campaign , saying the entire operation was in violation of the NATO charter . 
 = = = = = Pristina International Airport incident = = = = = 
 One of Clark 's most debated decisions during his SACEUR command was his attempted operation to attack Russian troops at Pristina International Airport , immediately after the end of the Kosovo War in June 1999 . A joint NATO – Russia peacekeeping operation was supposed to police Kosovo . Russia wanted their peacekeeping force to operate independently of NATO , but NATO refused . British forces were supposed to occupy Pristina International Airport , but a contingent of Russian troops arrived before they did and took control of the airport . Clark called then @-@ Secretary General of NATO Javier Solana , who told him " you have transfer of authority " in the area . General Clark then issued an order for the NATO troops to attack and " overpower " the armed Russian troops . 
 In response , Captain James Blount ( later a singer known by the stage name James Blunt ) , leading the British troops , refused to obey the order . Blount was supported in that decision by General Mike Jackson , the British commander of the Kosovo Force . Jackson refused to support the attack , reportedly saying " I 'm not going to start the Third World War for you " . Jackson has said he refused to take action because he did not believe it was worth the risk of a military confrontation with the Russians , instead insisting that troops encircle the airfield . After two days of stand @-@ off and negotiations , NATO agreed to an independent Russian peacekeeping force , and Russia relinquished control of the airport . 
 The refusal was criticized by some senior U.S. military personnel , with General Hugh Shelton calling Jackson 's refusal " troubling " . During hearings in the United States Senate , Senator John Warner suggested that the refusal might have been illegal , and that if it was legal , rules potentially should be changed . British Chief of the Defence Staff Charles Guthrie agreed with Jackson . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 Clark received another call from General Shelton in July 1999 in which he was told that Secretary Cohen wanted Clark to leave his command in April 2000 , less than three years after he assumed the post . Clark was surprised by this , because he believed <unk> were expected to serve at least three years . Clark was told that this was necessary because General Joseph Ralston was leaving his post as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and would need another 4 @-@ star command within 60 days or he would be forced to retire . Ralston was not going to be appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff due to an extramarital affair in his past , and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him . Clark said this explanation " didn 't wash " ; he believed the legal issues did not necessarily bar him from a full term . Clinton signed on to Ralston 's reassignment , although David Halberstam wrote that the president and Madeleine Albright were angered at Clark 's treatment . Clark spent the remainder of his time as SACEUR overseeing peacekeeper forces and , without a new command to take , was forced into retirement from the military on May 2 , 2000 . 
 Rumors persisted that Clark was forced out due to his contentious relationship with some in Washington , D.C. ; however , he has dismissed such rumors , calling it a " routine personnel action " . The Department of Defense said it was merely a " general rotation of American senior ranks " . However , a NATO ambassador told the International Herald Tribune that Clark 's dismissal seemed to be a " political thing from the United States " . General Hugh Shelton would say of Clark during his 2004 campaign that " the reason he came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues , things that are very near and dear to my heart . I 'm not going to say whether I 'm a Republican or a Democrat . I 'll just say Wes won 't get my vote . " Shelton never elaborated further on what these issues were . 
 = = Civilian career = = 
 Clark set himself three initial goals in civilian life — to earn $ 40 million in the business world and practice philanthropy , to become an adjunct professor , and to become a professional golfer . Clark began a public speaking tour in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government , including House Speaker Newt Gingrich , White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty , and Richard Holbrooke . Clark took McLarty 's advice to move back to Little Rock , Arkansas , and took a position with the Stephens Group , an investment firm headquartered there . He took several other board positions at defense @-@ related firms , and in March 2003 he amicably left the Stephens Group to found Wesley K. Clark & Associates . Clark wrote two books , Waging Modern War and Winning Modern Wars . He also authored forewords for a series of military biographies and a series of editorials . He had amassed only about $ 3 @.@ 1 million towards his $ 40 million goal by 2003 , and he began considering running for public office instead of pursuing his business career . 
 = = = 2004 presidential campaign = = = 
 Clark has said that he began to truly define his politics only after his military retirement and the 2000 presidential election , won by George W. Bush . Clark had a conversation with Condoleezza Rice in which she told him that the war in Kosovo would not have occurred under Bush . Clark found such an admission unsettling , as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the interventionist policies of the Clinton administration . He said he would see it as a sign that things were " starting to go wrong " with American foreign policy under Bush . Clark supported the administration 's War in Afghanistan in response to the September 11 , 2001 , attacks but did not support the Iraq War . Clark continued to warn people as a commentator on CNN that he believed the United States was undermanned in Iraq . He said the war was " never [ about ] ... WMD or regime change " and believes " the connection to the War on Terrorism was not shown . " 
 Clark met with a group of wealthy New York Democrats including Alan <unk> to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election . <unk> , a supporter of Al Gore in 2000 , met with all the Democratic candidates but supported Clark in 2004 . Clark said that he voted for Al Gore and Ronald Reagan , held equal esteem for Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman , and was a registered independent voter throughout his military career . Clark stated that he decided he was a Democrat because " I was pro @-@ affirmative action , I was pro @-@ choice , I was pro @-@ education ... I 'm pro @-@ health care ... I realized I was either going to be the loneliest Republican in America or I was going to be a happy Democrat . " Clark said he liked the Democratic party , which he saw as standing for " internationalism " , " ordinary men and women " , and " fair play . " 
 A " Draft Clark " campaign began to grow with the launch of <unk> on April 10 , 2003 . The organization signed up tens of thousands of volunteers , made 150 media appearances discussing Clark , and raised $ 1 @.@ 5 million in pledges for his campaign . A different website , <unk> , was the first organization to register as a political action committee in June 2003 to persuade Clark to run . They had presented him with 1000 emails in May 2003 from throughout the country asking him to run . One of <unk> 's founders , Brent <unk> , said of the draft effort : " Just fifty @-@ two years ago citizens from all over the country were successful in their efforts to draft General Eisenhower . We intend to do the same in 2004 by drafting General Clark . If he runs , he wins . " 
 In June 2003 , Clark said that he was " seriously consider [ ing ] " running for president in an appearance on Meet the Press . Clark announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential primary elections from Little Rock on September 17 , 2003 , months after the other candidates . He acknowledged the influence of the Draft Clark movement , saying they " took an inconceivable idea and made it conceivable " . The campaign raised $ 3 @.@ 5 million in the first two weeks . The internet campaign would also establish the Clark Community Network of blogs , which remains in use and made heavy use of <unk> , where <unk> had established the second @-@ largest community of <unk> at the time . 
 Clark 's loyalty to the Democratic Party was questioned by some as soon as he entered the race . Senator Joe Lieberman called Clark 's party choice a matter of " political convenience , not conviction . " Republican Governor Bill Owens of Colorado and University of Denver president Marc Holtzman have claimed Clark once said " I would have been a Republican if Karl Rove had returned my phone calls . " Clark later claimed he was simply joking , but both Owens and Holtzman said the remark was delivered " very directly " and " wasn 't a joke . " Katharine Q. Seelye wrote that many believed Clark had chosen to be a Democrat in 2004 only because it was " the only party that did not have a nominee . " On May 11 , 2001 , Clark also delivered a speech to the Pulaski County Republican Party in Arkansas saying he was " very glad we 've got the great team in office , men like Colin Powell , Don Rumsfeld , Dick Cheney , Condoleezza Rice , Paul O 'Neill — people I know very well — our president George W. Bush . " U.S. News & World Report ran a story two weeks later claiming Clark had considered a political run as a Republican . 
 Clark , coming from a non @-@ political background , had no position papers to define his agenda for the public . Once in the campaign , however , several volunteers established a network of connections with the media , and Clark began to explain his stances on a variety of issues . He was , as he had told The Washington Post in October , pro @-@ choice and pro @-@ affirmative action . He called for a repeal of recent Bush tax cuts for people earning more than $ 200 @,@ 000 and suggested providing healthcare for the uninsured by altering the current system rather than transferring to a completely new universal health care system . He backed environmental causes such as promising to reverse " scaled down rules " the Bush administration had applied to the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and dealing with the potential effects of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles , livestock flatulence and other sources . Clark also proposed a global effort to strengthen American relations with other nations , reviewing the PATRIOT Act , and investing $ 100 billion in homeland security . Finally , he released a budget plan that claimed to save $ 2 @.@ 35 trillion over ten years through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts , sharing the cost of the Iraq War with other nations , and cutting government waste . 
 Some , such as Clark biographer Antonia Felix , have speculated that Clark 's inexperience at giving " soundbite " answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign . The day after he launched his campaign , for example , he was asked if he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution , which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War , a large issue in the 2004 campaign . Clark said , " At the time , I probably would have voted for it , but I think that 's too simple a question , " then " I don 't know if I would have or not . I 've said it both ways because when you get into this , what happens is you have to put yourself in a position — on balance , I probably would have voted for it . " Finally , Clark 's press secretary clarified his position as " you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN @-@ based solution . " After this series of responses , although Clark opposed the war , The New York Times ran a story with the headline " Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War " . Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season . He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said , " I think it 's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can 't get their own story straight ... I would have never voted for war . The war was an unnecessary war , it was an elective war , and it 's been a huge strategic mistake for this country . " 
 Another media incident started during the New Hampshire primary September 27 , 2003 , when Clark was asked by space shuttle astronaut Jay C. Buckey what his vision for the space program was after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster . Clark responded he was a great believer in the exploration of space but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane . " I would like to see mankind get off this planet . I 'd like to know what 's out there beyond the solar system . " Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology . Then at the end of his remarks , Clark dropped a bombshell when he said " I still believe in E = mc ² . But I can 't believe that in all of human history we 'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go . I happen to believe that mankind can do it . I 've argued with physicists about it . I 've argued with best friends about it . I just have to believe it . It 's my only faith @-@ based initiative . " These comments prompted a series of derisive headlines , such as " Beam Us Up , General Clark " in The New York Times , " Clark is Light @-@ Years Ahead of the Competition " in The Washington Post , " General Relativity ( Retired ) " on the U.S. News & World Report website , and " Clark Campaigns at Light Speed " in Wired magazine . 
 Several polls from September to November 2003 showed Clark leading the Democratic field of candidates or as a close second to Howard Dean with the Gallup poll having him in first place in the presidential race at 20 % as late as October 2003 . The John Edwards campaign brought on Hugh Shelton — the general who had said Clark was made to leave the SACEUR post early due to " integrity and character issues " — as an advisor , a move that drew criticism from the Clark campaign . Since Dean consistently polled in the lead in the Iowa caucuses , Clark opted out of participating in the caucuses entirely to focus on later primaries instead . The 2004 Iowa caucuses marked a turning point in the campaign for the Democratic nomination , however , as front @-@ runners Dean and Dick Gephardt garnered results far lower than expected , and John Kerry and John Edwards ' campaigns benefited in Clark 's absence . Clark performed reasonably well in later primaries , including a tie for third place with Edwards in the New Hampshire primary and a narrow victory in the Oklahoma primary over Edwards . However , he saw his third @-@ place finishes in Tennessee and Virginia as signs that he had lost the South , a focus of his campaign . He withdrew from the race on February 11 , 2004 , and announced his endorsement of John Kerry at a rally in Madison , Wisconsin , on February 13 . Clark believed his opting out of the Iowa caucus was one of his campaign 's biggest mistakes , saying to one supporter the day before he withdrew from the race that " everything would have been different if we had [ been in Iowa ] . " 
 = = = Post @-@ 2004 campaign = = = 
 Clark continued to speak in support of Kerry ( and the eventual Kerry / Edwards ticket ) throughout the remainder of the 2004 presidential campaign , including speaking at the 2004 Democratic National Convention on the final evening . He founded his current political action committee , <unk> , in April 2004 . Fox News Channel announced in June 2005 that they had signed General Clark as a military and foreign affairs analyst . He joined the Burkle Center for International Relations at UCLA as a senior fellow . A managing partner of the companies that support the Center , Ronald Burkle , described Clark 's position as " <unk> [ ing ] the center 's research " and " teaching [ the ] contemporary role of the United States in the international community . " 
 Clark campaigned heavily throughout the 2006 midterm election campaign , supporting numerous Democrats in a variety of federal , statewide , and state legislature campaigns . Ultimately his PAC aided 42 Democratic candidates who won their elections , including 25 who won seats formerly held by Republicans and 6 newly elected veteran members of the House and Senate . Clark was the most @-@ requested surrogate of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee throughout the 2006 campaign , and sometimes appeared with the leadership of the Democratic Party when they commented on security issues . 
 Clark has opposed taking military action against Iran and in January 2007 he criticized what he called " New York money people " pushing for a war . This led to accusations of antisemitism . 
 Clark serves on the Advisory Boards of the Global Panel Foundation and the National Security Network . He also chairman of Rodman & Renshaw , a New York investment bank , and Growth Energy . 
 = = = Speculation of 2008 presidential campaign = = = 
 Clark was mentioned as a potential 2008 presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket before endorsing Hillary Clinton for President . Before that time , he was ranked within the top Democratic candidates according to some Internet polls . After endorsing Hillary Clinton , Clark campaigned for her in Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada , and Ohio and in campaign commercials . After Barack Obama secured the Democratic nomination , Clark voiced his support for Obama . Clark was considered to be one of Obama 's possible vice @-@ presidential running mates . Clark , however , publicly endorsed Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius for the position , introducing her as " the next Vice President of the United States " at a June 2008 fundraiser in Texas . Obama eventually chose Joe Biden as his running mate . 
 = = = McCain military service controversy = = = 
 On June 29 , 2008 , Clark made comments on Face the Nation that were critical of Republican John McCain , calling into question the notion that McCain 's military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president . " I certainly honor [ McCain 's ] service as a prisoner of war " , Clark said , " but he hasn 't held executive responsibility . That large squadron in the navy that he commanded — it wasn 't a wartime squadron . He hasn 't been in there and ordered the bombs to fall . " When moderator Bob Schieffer noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he " ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down " , Clark responded that , ultimately , Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience , as McCain has done throughout his campaign . Clark 's retort , however , is what drew rebuke . In referring to McCain 's military experience , he stated : " Well , I don 't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president . " Both the McCain and Obama campaigns subsequently released statements rejecting Clark 's comment . However , Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as <unk> and military veteran groups such as <unk> ; Obama ultimately stated that Clark 's comments were " <unk> " and were not intended to attack McCain 's military service . In the days following the controversial interview , Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain 's military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat . In each program , Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honors McCain 's service , he has serious concerns about McCain 's judgment in matters of national security policy , calling McCain " untested and untried " .

 In Clark 's book , Winning Modern Wars , published in 2003 , he describes his conversation with a military officer in the Pentagon shortly after 9 / 11 regarding a plan to attack seven Middle Eastern countries in five years : " As I went back through the Pentagon in November 2001 , one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat . Yes , we were still on track for going against Iraq , he said . But there was more . This was being discussed as part of a five @-@ year campaign plan , he said , and there were a total of seven countries , beginning with Iraq , then Syria , Lebanon , Libya , Somalia , Sudan and finishing off Iran .

 = Jacksonville ( Fringe ) = 
 " Jacksonville " is the 15th episode of the second season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe , and the 35th episode overall . In the episode , Olivia is forced to recount her time spent as a child in tests conducted by Walter to regain the ability to see objects that have been influenced by the parallel universe and prevent the deaths of innocents . Though successful , Olivia comes to learn the truth about Peter , that he is from the parallel universe . 
 The episode was a mid @-@ season finale . It was written by Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz , and directed by filmmaker Charles Beeson . It premiered to mostly positive reviews on February 4 , 2010 in the United States , earning an estimated 7 @.@ 76 million viewers . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A localized earthquake in New York City damages only one building , killing nearly all inside . The Fringe team discovers that a second building appeared at the same location as the first , fusing the structure and people inside together . Walter ( John Noble ) realizes that the second building has been pulled from the parallel universe by Thomas Jerome Newton , using the technology that Walter and William Bell had discovered years ago . Walter warns that because of conservation of mass , a building of similar mass will be taken from the prime universe to the parallel one sometime in the next few days . 
 While Massive Dynamic offers its computing resources to identify possible buildings of similar mass , Walter implores Olivia ( Anna Torv ) to recall her childhood Cortexiphan @-@ induced ability to see objects from the alternate universe , believing she will be able to foresee which building will be affected and warn everyone in time . He takes her to the disused child @-@ care facility in Jacksonville , Florida , where the Cortexiphan trials were performed . Walter first puts Olivia under heavy sedation , and she experiences meeting her younger , frightened self , but is still unable to trigger her ability . Olivia begins to remember the gruesome trials she experienced , including footage from one test where she exhibited pyrokinesis . As Walter 's deadline nears , he realizes that Olivia is no longer frightened and thus she cannot engage her abilities , which were triggered by fear . 
 They return to New York City as small micro @-@ quakes occur , indicating the onset of the event . Though a few buildings have been identified as possible targets , there are far too many to evacuate without starting a mass panic . Olivia , unable to help , goes off privately , but Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) follows and comforts her . Olivia soon recognizes she is frightened again , and races to a rooftop , seeing a building " shimmer " in the distance . The building , a hotel , is quickly identified from the list of candidates , and it is evacuated in time , moments before it is pulled into the parallel universe . 
 Agent Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) provides a cover story of an unexpected controlled demolition to explain the disappearance of the hotel . Olivia later meets Peter at his house prior to them going out on a date , but when she arrives , she sees the same shimmer on Peter . Walter quietly asks Olivia not to tell Peter that he is from the other universe .

Prior to the initial broadcast of " Jacksonville " , co @-@ creator J.J. Abrams and showrunners / executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman released a joint statement about its plot , " Along with the usual mystery , suspense , science and general wackiness , the episode contains one big answer , the consequences of which will affect our team for the remainder of the season and beyond . " Stentz later explained in the DVD audio commentary that in " Jacksonville by and large , the fringe event is Olivia . Olivia realizing that even in chasing all of these fringe events , she is the biggest fringe event of them all . " Also in the commentary , Pinkner added that for the episode 's final scene , " We knew it would be in the back third of the season that we would really acknowledge for Olivia that Peter came from the Other Side . The worst circumstance that could happen in is at a moment when they are getting as close together as possible " . 
 Commenting on Peter 's secret origins affecting their relationship , actress Anna Torv stated in an interview with Digital Spy that " Jacksonville " is " the episode that pushes us forward with a huge amount of momentum towards the end of the season . It all gets mixed up and then you find out what the drive is behind all of this . It 's the big spanner in the works ! The secret definitely has a huge impact on the lives of everyone involved . " 
 " Jacksonville " was the first episode of Fox 's initiative with Science Olympiad to release lesson plans for grade school students . Each lesson would relate to the week 's particular science ; in " Jacksonville " ' s case , the intention was for " Students [ to ] learn about earthquakes of different magnitudes , as well as their impact on buildings and how it can be mitigated . " Jeff Pinkner commented , " Everything we do is grounded in some version of authentic fringe science and what scientists believe is possible , " and was pleased to be a part of " anything that can help invest kids in learning .

 " Jacksonville " premiered to generally positive reviews . James Poniewozik of Time Magazine called it " fine " and " well @-@ acted " , especially liking John Noble 's performance . Noel Murray of The A.V.

Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly loved " Jacksonville " , believing it to be a " tremendously moving , startling episode " and " one of [ Fringe 's ] finest hours " . AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw particularly praised the scene of Olivia trying to comfort her younger self , and then confronting Walter over it .

 As part of a government surveillance program , the player monitors phone calls to find public threats . Apart from infrequent interaction with their handler , the player is left to solve puzzles in pursuit of one such lead . The puzzles are based on the " reflection puzzle " popularized by role @-@ playing video games wherein the player moves mirrors to reflect a beam of light about a room . In TouchTone , the player swipes the screen to move pieces that redirect incoming beams , symbolic of phone signals , into specific locations . The waveform beams are displayed in different solid colors and must be matched with the destination " node " of the same color by passing through moveable pieces that reflect and split the beam . The pieces do not move individually but as rows and columns in cardinal directions . 
 The levels are displayed in an overworld with a branching , tree structure . The player must pursue multiple branches to further the story . Optional , side @-@ story branches do not advance the main plot but have the hardest puzzles . The story is told through chains of emails , which are unlocked by completing puzzles . The player assumes the role of an American Muslim National Security Agency agent who determines whether the hacked emails are pertinent to national security . The ethics of government surveillance are a core theme of the game .

 Mikengreg , an indie game developer duo of Mike Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend , released the 2010 Solipskier and 2012 Gasketball together before TouchTone in 2015 . After Gasketball 's release , Boxleiter and Wohlwend planned a celebratory road trip to a game jam in Victoria , British Columbia . Gasketball turned out to be a " financial flop " , and so Boxleiter wanted to use the jam to create " something new , ... something really small and perfect " . By the end of the two @-@ day jam , the core mirror reflection mechanics of TouchTone were in place , though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize the remainder of the game . During this time , the two also worked separately , and Wohlwend released the well @-@ received Threes with Asher Vollmer in 2014 . Wohlwend tried to fit audio signal elements into TouchTone 's nascent theme of light , lasers , and prisms . They felt this direction was unsuccessful , like a " boring Flash game " , and that the game too closely mimicked " a hacking minigame from a bigger AAA game like BioShock or System Shock " . 
 TouchTone found its theme following the Edward Snowden global surveillance disclosures in mid 2013 , as Mikengreg felt they could provide satirical commentary through the " hacking " element of the game . The story shed its jocular tone as it and its political content grew deeper and more serious . Boxleiter wrote most of the script , which totaled over 20 @,@ 000 words in length . It was his first effort at professional writing , and it took him five months . He and Wohlwend would conference after each chapter for coherency . Boxleiter wanted the story to explore the " questions ... floating around the national consciousness " rather than be " heavy @-@ handed " and prescriptive . Despite this work , Boxleiter felt that the story and the gameplay " don 't necessarily interact with each other " , with the story serving to drive those less interested in puzzles through the rest of the game . They playtested the game in public at the theater in Logan Square , Chicago , though they acknowledged difficulty in playtesting the story 's private experience . Mikengreg decided against including an option to skip puzzles , which they felt would spoil the game and the player 's capacity to adapt to increasing difficulty . They attribute this game design philosophy to Derek Yu of Spelunky . 
 TouchTone was released as an iOS universal app for both iPhone and iPad on March 19 , 2015 . It received a front page feature on the iOS App Store upon its release .

 TouchTone received " generally favorable " reviews , according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic . It received Pocket Gamer 's silver award . 
 Reviewers praised the game 's aesthetics and criticized its unoriginal puzzle concept . TouchArcade 's Shaun Musgrave wrote that the game 's " striking " visuals and " politically charged " message were not completely reconciled but were " individually strong " . He described its art style as similar to Wohlwend 's previous work and its political statement as indicative of Mikengreg 's strong opinions . Musgrave praised the game 's writing but thought the actual puzzles were weaker . 148Apps 's Jordan Minor found the " clinical , minimally @-@ colored cyberspace " and 1970s thriller film aesthetic " chillingly appropriate " for the theme 's tension . He also chided the puzzles for not being " a reward unto themselves " and the gameplay 's " monotony " for being similar to that of Papers , Please without serving the same dehumanizing point . Minor called TouchTone " essentially a series of the hacking minigames ... [ from ] BioShock , Deus Ex , or Watch Dogs . " Pocket Gamer 's Craig Grannell appreciate how the game " often forces a kind of upside @-@ down thinking " and compared its message to that of <unk> . Gamezebo 's Jim Squires said that TouchTone is " perfectly designed for a certain set of mobile gamers " and compared its gameplay to the 1987 <unk> . Despite the game 's similarity to " countless light @-@ bending puzzle games " , he found Mikengreg 's implementation " fiendishly clever " in the way the player moves rows of tiles rather than one at a time . 
 Reviewers did not like the inability to skip puzzles . Musgrave wrote that moments of being " stuck on a mandatory stage " detracted from the player 's investment and sense of immersion in the story . Grannell of Pocket Gamer wrote that TouchTone 's linearity was its " only downside " , though he also wished for options to " undo " mid @-@ game choices and to save puzzle progress upon leaving the game . Multiple reviewers appreciated the game 's story . Wired 's Kyle <unk> felt that the act of determining whether messages were pertinent to national security was a " powerful experience " . Squires of Gamezebo considered the story one of the game 's strong points , and unusually so for a puzzle game . He wrote that there was sufficient " intrigue " to want to finish the story , and that the reward of more story encouraged him to get through the harder puzzles . 
 = Ravenloft ( module ) = 
 Ravenloft is an adventure module for the Dungeons & Dragons ( D & D ) fantasy role @-@ playing game . The American game publishing company TSR , Inc. released it as a standalone adventure booklet in 1983 for use with the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game . It was written by Tracy and Laura Hickman , and includes art by Clyde Caldwell with maps by David Sutherland III . The plot of Ravenloft focuses on the villain Strahd von Zarovich , a vampire who pines for his lost love . Various story elements , including Strahd 's motivation and the locations of magical weapons , are randomly determined by drawing cards . The player characters attempt to defeat Strahd and , if successful , the adventure ends . 
 The Hickmans began work on Ravenloft in the late 1970s , intent on creating a frightening portrait of a vampire in a setting that combined Gothic horror with the D & D game system . They play @-@ tested the adventure with a group of players each Halloween for five years before it was published . Strahd has since appeared in a number of D & D accessories and novels . The module has inspired numerous revisions and adaptations , including a campaign setting of the same name and a sequel . In 1999 , on the 25th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons , two commemorative versions of Ravenloft were released . 
 Ravenloft has won one award , been included on two " best of " lists , and was generally well received by critics of its era . In 1984 , it won the Strategists ' Club Award for Outstanding Play Aid , and it appeared second in Dungeon magazine 's list of the top 30 D & D adventures . Several reviewers liked the included maps , and White Dwarf magazine gave it 8 out of 10 overall . A Dragon magazine review praised the module , but felt that the D & D elements detracted from the Gothic horror atmosphere . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The story involves a party of player characters ( PCs ) who travel to the land of Barovia , a small nation surrounded by a deadly magical fog . The master of nearby Castle Ravenloft , Count Strahd von Zarovich , <unk> rules the country , and a prologue explains that the residents must barricade their doors each night to avoid attacks by Strahd and his minions . The Burgomaster 's mansion is the focus of these attacks , and , for reasons that are not initially explained , Strahd is after the Burgomaster 's adopted daughter , Ireena <unk> . 
 Before play begins , the Dungeon Master ( or DM , the player who organizes and directs the game play ) randomly draws five cards from a deck of six . Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd : the Holy Symbol and the <unk> . The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd , a book that details Strahd 's long @-@ ago unrequited love . In this work , it is revealed that Strahd had fallen in love with a young girl , who in turn loved his younger brother . Strahd blamed his age for the rejection , and made a pact with evil powers to live forever . He then slew his brother , but the young girl killed herself in response , and Strahd found that he had become a vampire . All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft . 
 The fifth and final card selected determines Strahd 's motivation . There are four possible motivations for Strahd . He may want to replace one of the PCs and attempt to turn the character into a vampire and take on that character 's form . He may desire the love of Ireena , whose appearance matches that of his lost love , Tatyana . Using mind control , Strahd will try to force a PC to attack Ireena and gain her love by " saving " her from the situation he created . Strahd may also want to create an evil magic item , or destroy the <unk> . If , during play , the party 's fortune is told at the gypsy camp in Barovia , the random elements are altered to match the cards drawn by the gypsy . 
 As the party journeys through Barovia and the castle , the game play is guided using 12 maps with corresponding sections in the book 's body guide . Example maps and sections include the Lands of Barovia , the Court of the Count , five entries for each level of the Spires of Ravenloft , and the Dungeons and Catacombs . Each location contains treasure and adversaries , including zombies , wolves , ghouls , ghosts , and other creatures . The main objective of the game is to destroy Count Strahd . The DM is instructed to play the vampire intelligently , and to keep him alive as long as possible , making him flee when necessary . In an optional epilogue , Ireena is reunited with her lover . They leave the " mortal world " as Ireena says , " Through these many centuries we have played out the tragedy of our lives . "

 Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis married in 1977 . Soon after , while living in Provo , Utah , they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft . When they began work on Ravenloft , they felt the vampire archetype had become overused , trite , and mundane , and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module . They play @-@ tested it with a group of players every Halloween for five years before it was published in 1983 by TSR . The plot combined elements of the horror genre with Dungeons & Dragons conventions for the first time . At the time of Ravenloft 's release , each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged . Ravenloft was labeled <unk> : the sixth in a series of intermediate @-@ level modules for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ( AD & D ) . It consisted of a 32 @-@ page book , with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario . 
 Tracy Hickman once ran the adventure as a Dungeon Master . According to him , the experience was like an old scary movie , with " the obligatory castle high on the craggy cliff with the wolves howling in the woods . Sure enough , the vampire was up there in the castle . To most of the players it seemed like a straight forward task : find the vampire and kill him . " One player discovered Strahd 's backstory and was so affected by it that when it came time to kill the vampire at the end of the adventure , despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd , he refused , and his companions were forced to complete the task . Afterwards , Hickman asked him why . " He deserved to die better than that , " his friend said , to which Hickman replied " Yes [ ... ] But that is how it is with people who fall from greatness . He chose his end when he first chose to kill his brother . How could it be any different ? " 
 According to a Wizards of the Coast article , Strahd has become one of the most infamous and well @-@ known villains in the Dungeons & Dragons game , and he has appeared in a number of novels and rulebooks since his debut in Ravenloft . In an introduction to an online edition of Ravenloft II , author John D. Rateliff described Strahd as a then @-@ unusual fusion of a monster with the abilities of a player character class ; that is , a vampire magic @-@ user . This design enables him to combine his own powers with the surrounding environment , making him a difficult opponent to defeat . 
 To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game in 1999 , two additional versions of the Ravenloft module were released . The first was a reprinting of the original adventure made available in the Dungeons & Dragons Silver Anniversary Collector 's Edition boxed set , with slight modifications to make it distinguishable from the original ( for collecting purposes ) . The second was the silver anniversary edition of Ravenloft that was adapted for use with the second edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons ( Wizards of the Coast periodically alters the rules of Dungeons & Dragons and releases a new version ) . 
 = = = Ravenloft II : The House on Gryphon Hill = = = 
 Ravenloft 's success led to a sequel in 1986 titled Ravenloft II : The House on Gryphon Hill . Although Tracy Hickman was credited in Ravenloft II , he had left TSR before the module was completed . The writing was done by David " Zeb " Cook , Jeff Grubb , Harold Johnson , and Douglas Niles , following the Hickmans ' outline . Each writer pursued a different section of the module in order to meet the deadline . Clyde Caldwell , who had done all of the art for the original Ravenloft module , provided the cover , but interior art was done by Jeff Easley . The adventure is designed for first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons characters of levels 8 – 10 . The adventure was 48 pages , and included a large color map and an outer folder . It shared structural elements with the original , including variable NPC goals and variable locations for key objects , so that Gryphon Hill plays differently each time . The module 's plot features an artifact known as The Apparatus that switches a monster 's personality with that of an ordinary <unk> ; player characters , therefore , are uncertain about the true identity of the people they meet . The module also introduces <unk> the lich , who later became a major character in the Ravenloft campaign setting . This module is playable alone , or as a sequel to the original Ravenloft . It includes descriptions of the town of <unk> , as well as some haunted moors , and a manor house , all mapped in perspective like the original module . 
 = = = Adaptations = = = 
 In 1986 , Ravenloft was adapted into the gamebook Master of Ravenloft , # 6 in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Adventure <unk> series . In the book , the reader plays the role of <unk> <unk> , a paladin , who must defeat Count Strahd von Zarovich to save a young girl from becoming one of the undead . The gamebook was written by Jean Blashfield , with cover art by Clyde Caldwell and interior art by Gary Williams . 
 Ravenloft inspired a campaign setting of the same name , published in 1990 . According to Andria <unk> , the boxed set 's developer , " TSR 's classic AD & D adventure , <unk> Ravenloft , inspired this world 's creation . " The Ravenloft : Realm of Terror boxed set was published as part of the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons and , according to its back cover , it is " rooted in the Gothic tradition " and contains " tips for adding fear to your games " . The setting of the module was expanded ; Ravenloft is now a <unk> ( an alternate dimension ) . The boxed set 's version of Strahd is similar to character in the original adventure , but his abilities were increased and his background explained in more detail . The campaign setting has produced a number of spin @-@ offs , and this new version of Strahd was used as a major character in a number of novels . 
 The original Ravenloft module has been revised and expanded twice . In 1993 , TSR published House of Strahd ( module code <unk> ) . It was updated to include rules from the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons . The module credits the original work by the Hickmans , but was revised by Bruce Nesmith , who along with Andria <unk> created the Ravenloft campaign setting . Nesmith introduced some new creatures , developed Strahd 's tactics further , and added a Time @-@ Track Table so that the referee can anticipate the sunset . In October 2006 , Wizards of the Coast released an updated and expanded version of the original module for Dungeons & Dragons version 3 @.@ 5 as a 226 @-@ page hardcover book entitled Expedition to Castle Ravenloft . It was based on the original module , and not the Ravenloft material made in the intervening years . Expedition to Castle Ravenloft is designed to be played as a mini @-@ campaign lasting about 20 game sessions , much longer than the original module , although it contains options for running long 8 @-@ session or short 4 @-@ session adventures . The book also includes suggestions for incorporating the adventure into an existing generic setting , Forgotten Realms , Eberron or d20 Modern campaign . The original module was adapted to the <unk> game system as <unk> in 2002 , and its sequel as <unk> 2 : <unk> 's Legacy in 2004 . Wizards of the Coast released the board game Castle Ravenloft in 2010 .

 Ravenloft won one award , and was included on two " best of " lists . In 1984 , it won the Strategists ' Club Award for Outstanding Play Aid . The book Dungeon Master For Dummies chose the module as one of the ten best classic adventures , saying it is " perhaps our favorite D & D adventure of all time " , Ravenloft " takes the Dracula legend and gives it a D & D spin " , and praised the detailed yet concise plot and isometric maps . The book also claims that Ravenloft " inspired game designers and Dungeon Masters to take the art of adventure to the next level . " 
 In 2004 , on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game , Dungeon magazine ranked the module as the second greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time — behind Queen of the Spiders . The editor of Dungeon praised the placement of treasure , and Strahd 's motivation was described as " a brilliant way to let fate drive the plot and evoke the mystery and mystique of Barovia " . Bill Slavicsek , director of Wizards of the Coast 's RPGs and Miniatures department , noted that it was the first adventure to " mix tone , story , and dungeon crawl " in a module , and game designer Andy Collins agreed . Clark Peterson , president of Necromancer Games , singled out the maps and Strahd for praise , saying the vampire is " perhaps one of the best villains of all time " . Author John Rateliff also applauded the maps and the randomization , as well as Strahd 's duality as a vampire / magic @-@ user . The catacombs , where player characters were teleported away and replaced with undead wights , was singled out at as the adventure 's " defining moment " by the magazine 's editors . 
 Reviews for Ravenloft were generally positive . In the July 1984 issue of White Dwarf magazine , the module was given 8 out of 10 overall , with the reviewer mentioning its presentation as a positive , and its complexity as a negative . It was likened to a Hammer horror production and praised as enjoyable , although the reviewer said the game 's puns were tedious and detracted from the spooky atmosphere . Reviewer Dave Morris said it " should be a lot of fun – ' light , relief ' of a nerve @-@ wracking and deadly sort . " Morris concluded that Ravenloft is " full of clever touches " , and " features some first @-@ class illustration and graphics " . In a review for the January 1984 issue of Dragon magazine ( published by a subsidiary of TSR ) , game designer Ken Rolston argued that , despite its design innovations , Ravenloft was still in essence a dungeon @-@ style adventure . Rolston praised the randomization , the maps , and the player text ( which is read aloud to the players by the DM ) . He said the player text " consistently develops an atmosphere of darkness and decay . " Despite this , Rolston felt that the adventure has trouble in developing a frightening tone . He singles out its use of common monsters in D & D , an abundance of traps , and frequent combat interludes as elements that detract from the adventure 's spookiness by interrupting the module 's flow . Ultimately , he felt that in " AD & D terms it is a masterpiece " , but not a work of " Gothic horror " . Tracy Hickman stated in 1998 , " I still believe the original Ravenloft modules were perhaps the best that ever had my name on them . "

 George Babcock Cressey ( December 15 , 1896 - October 21 , 1963 ) was an American geographer , author , and academic . Born in Tiffin , Ohio , he attended Denison University and then the University of Chicago , where he received a PhD in geology . After receiving his degree , he taught at Shanghai college and traveled widely in China . Upon his return to the United States in 1929 , he completed a pioneering book on the country , China 's Geographic Foundations . 
 In 1931 , Cressey received a second PhD from Clark University in geography . He then joined the faculty of Syracuse University , where he remained for the rest of his professional career . At Syracuse , Cressey wrote on a variety of subjects , but focused on " population problems as related to the worldwide distribution of land and arable resources , " and primarily studied Asia , though he traveled to 75 countries on six continents ( all but Australia ) , over the course of his career . Cressey also served as chair of the department and helped to develop the geography graduate program at Syracuse into one of the best in the country . 
 In addition to his academic work , Cressey consulted for the US Department of State , the Board of Economic Warfare , and the Military Intelligence Corps during World War II . After the war , he was also an outspoken advocate of better relations with Communist China and traveled widely in East Asia and the Middle East with a variety of fellowships . Cressey was also highly involved in a number of professional organizations , serving as President of the International Geographical Union , the Association for Asian Studies , and the Association of American Geographers . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Cressey was born in Tiffin , Ohio , on December 15 , 1896 . His father , Frank G. Cressey , was a Baptist minister and his mother , Frances Babcock , the first woman to graduate from the University of Chicago , taught Latin at Denison University . After high school , Cressey attended Denison University , graduating in 1919 with a B.S. He then entered the University of Chicago , where he studied under the noted geologist Rollin D. Salisbury , receiving a Master 's degree in 1921 and a PhD in 1923 , both in geology . His dissertation was entitled " A Study of Indiana Sand Dunes . " 
 After receiving his degree , Cressey went to China with the American Baptist Missionary Union and took a position at Shanghai College in Shanghai , China , teaching both geology and geography . While in China , he met Marion Chatfield , an American missionary , whom he married in 1925 . The two went on to have one son and three daughters . Cressey also used his time in China to travel in East Asia , visiting Mongolia and the Ordos Desert with particular frequency . His trips were often dangerous and took him far from other Westerners ; during one of his trips , in Hebei , he was beaten and robbed by a group of bandits . His travels in China covered more than 30 @,@ 000 miles , and formed the basis of a book he began writing , China 's Geographic Foundations : A Survey of the Land and its Peoples . Cressey finished the book shortly before leaving China and gave the manuscript to the Commercial Press in Shanghai to prepare for publication . In 1932 , however , the press was bombed by the Japanese and the manuscript was lost in the ensuing fire . 
 = = Second PhD and academic career = = 
 In 1929 , Cressey left China , returning to the United States for a year of study at Harvard University . In 1931 , he earned a second PhD , in geography , from Clark University , writing his dissertation on the Ordos Desert . The same year , Cressey joined the faculty of Syracuse University as a professor of geography and geology , and soon became chairman of the department . After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in September 1931 , Cressey 's travels in Asia made him a sought @-@ after expert and lecturer on China , and he traveled frequently , giving lectures to academic audiences and the general public . Cressey also began to reconstruct his book , China 's Geographic Foundations , from his original notes , finishing it in 1934 . 
 In China 's Geographic Foundations , Cressey focused on describing the 15 geographic regions of China , but he also devoted chapters to " history , topography , climate , agriculture , and foreign trade . " Writing in Political Science Quarterly , Grover Clark called the book " a clear , comprehensive and yet comprehensible description of the land and the people 's relation to it . " The book went on to become " the standard work in its field . " Although welcomed by the Kuomintang , the book was " strongly criticized " by the Communist Party of China because of Cressey 's judgment that China lacked the resources to quickly become a great industrial power . 
 While teaching at Syracuse , Cressey continued his travels , and in 1937 , he visited Moscow , where he was invited to consult on the production of the Great Soviet World Atlas . After his trip to Moscow , Cressey traveled widely in the Soviet Union , and after returning to the United States he spoke of the great economic potential of the country , despite anti @-@ Soviet sentiment . As a result , he earned " the trust and gratitude of his Soviet colleagues , " allowing him access to their knowledge and resources . Cressey also spent the 1930s developing the academic offerings at Syracuse , building " one of the best Master of Arts programs in geography available in the United States . " 
 = = World War II = = 
 After the US entry into World War II , Cressey became a consultant to several government bodies , including the US Department of State , the Board of Economic Warfare , and the Military Intelligence Corps . Cressey also taught and lectured on Asia , for the Army 's training program at Syracuse University , and lectured publicly on East Asia throughout the country . In 1943 and 1944 , he served as a special representative in China through the State Department 's cultural exchange program . In that capacity , Cressey worked with the National Academy of Sciences to help establish Chinese universities , and promote better relations with China . 
 During the war , Cressey also wrote his second book : Asia 's Lands and Peoples : A Geography of One @-@ Third the Earth and Two @-@ <unk> its People , published in 1944 . The book was aimed at the ordinary American as a general overview of Asia in light of rising American interest in the region due to the war . In the book , Cressey also entered into the debate on how to divide Asia from Europe by arguing that Europe was really only one of the six regions of Eurasia , the other five being the Soviet Union , East Asia , Southeast Asia , India , and Southwest Asia . Cressey also made the controversial argument in the book that " the key to enduring peace in eastern Asia is a strong China . " The book was well received , and Dudley Stamp wrote that it had " the sure touch of the man who has been to see for himself . " 
 = = Post @-@ war career = = 
 After the war , Cressey became chair of the newly independent Department of Geography at Syracuse , and worked to make Syracuse a top institution for the study of Asia . He brought Asian scholars and graduate students to Syracuse , and used his department 's funds to send maps and books to the geography departments within Asian universities . During the years following the war , he was also active within the Association of American Geographers , International Geographical Union and the Association for Asian Studies . 
 During the 1950s period of McCarthyism , Cressey 's interest in China and his " outspoken comments on the shortcomings of American foreign policy " led to his inclusion on various " lists of scholars suspected of sympathy with the Communists , " but the accusations were baseless and Syracuse University continued to fully support him . Ironically , at the same time that Cressey was accused of communist sympathies , the Chinese government included him on its list of its capitalist enemies . 
 In 1951 , Cressey retired as chairman of the geography department at Syracuse and became Maxwell Distinguished Professor of Geography , a newly created position . Over the next ten years , he traveled frequently and published prolifically . He also received several honors . From 1949 to 1952 , he served as President of the International Geographical Union and in 1952 he was elected as a Vice President , a position he held until 1956 . That same year , he received the George Davidson Medal of the American Geographical Society and in 1958 he received a distinguished service award from the National Council for Geographic Education . In 1961 @-@ 1962 , he was a Phi Beta Kappa National Visiting Scholar and in 1962 @-@ 1963 he was served as a Department of State Visiting Professor in Asia . Cressey also served as Honorary President of the Association of American Geographers in 1957 and President of the Association for Asian Studies in 1959 and 1960 . 
 In 1955 and 1956 , Cressey held a Fulbright Fellowship in Iraq and in 1957 and 1958 he served as a Smith @-@ Mundt Professor in Lebanon . From his research and travel during these fellowships , Cressey wrote the book Crossroads : Land and Life in Southwest Asia , which was published in 1960 . In the first section of the book , Cressey dealt with the general geographical features of the Middle East . The next eight chapters dealt with the specific countries of the region from Egypt to Afghanistan , creating a picture of the whole region . Cressey focused in detail on the role of natural resources for the countries of the region , concentrating particular attention on the role of water and water shortages . W.B. Fisher , writing in Geographical Review , called the book " an authoritative and compelling study , " and Leonard Kasdan wrote in the American Anthropologist that the book was the " most useful single compendium of the aspects covered that exists in the literature to date . " 
 Although he broadened his regional interests in the 1950s , Cressey remained interested in China and his " enduring concern was to restore contact between China and the United States , " after the break in their relations following the Communist victory . He also promoted the study of China , hoping to educate a new generation of geographers with knowledge of China and East Asia . 
 Cressey died of cancer on October 21 , 1963 at his home in Syracuse , New York . 
 = Parsley Peel = 
 Robert Peel ( 1723 – 12 September 1795 ) , commonly known as Parsley Peel , was an influential cotton mill owner and grandfather to Sir Robert Peel , 2nd Baronet , future prime minister of Great Britain . Peel started life as a yeoman farmer but experimented with calico printing , eventually creating a parsley leaf pattern which would become his trademark . Despite losing a number of machines during riots , Peel 's company became the largest in the textile sector by the time of his death , with 23 factories . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Robert Peele was born in 1723 at Peele Fold in Oswaldtwistle to William Peele and Jane Anne Peele . His family were traditionally yeoman farmers , until his grandfather Robert Peele abandoned the trade in favour of making woollen cloth . Parsley 's father , William , attempted to return the family to farming and after his education at Blackburn Grammar School , he initially joined his father in this pursuit . He inherited the woodblocks his grandfather used for printing on wool and started experimenting with them . When his wife 's brother , William Haworth , returned from an apprenticeship to a calico @-@ printer in London , the pair attempted to set up a business in calico printing . They received financial backing from William Yates , the landlord of the local public house and formed Haworth , Peel and Yates in 1750 , consisting of a factory in Blackburn and a warehouse in Manchester . By this point , Peel had dropped the final ' e ' from his surname , his reason being that " it was of no use , as it did not add to the sound " . 
 = = Calico printing = = 
 Peel had gained a reputation for trying new methods within the industry , being one of the first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders . He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until , according to family tradition , his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him to use it as a pattern . He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing , which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household . There are other versions of the tale , which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour , Mrs. Milton , <unk> the cloth to finish it . 
 The exact nature of the discovery made by Peel is unclear . It is likely that it was a new method for using the acetate of lead as a dye @-@ fixer ( mordant ) . Another possibility is the use of metal engraving rather than wooden blocks to create the pattern . However it came to be , the pattern was named " Nancy 's pattern " after Peel 's daughter and was very popular – leading to Robert Peel 's nickname of " Parsley Peel " . The company went on to be one of the first calico printers in Lancashire .

 Peel worked with one of his weavers , James Hargreaves , to investigate new technologies . In 1762 , Peel and Hargreaves set up a carding machine , but decided against using it . When Hargreaves went on to invent the spinning jenny in 1764 , Peel was keen to use the technology . He set them up in his factory at Stanhill where Hargreaves worked . In the spring of 1768 , the spinning jennies at Peel 's factory were blamed for job losses . The factories and Hargreaves ' nearby house were the targets of a riot , destroying the spinning jennies within – along with some of Peel 's own inventions . In reaction , Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire . He decided on Burton @-@ upon @-@ Trent where he built three mills , including cutting a canal for one . 
 In 1779 , Peel 's mill in Altham was caught in series of riots against machinery , specifically the carding machines and spinning jenny . Peel came to see the destruction as fortuitous , as he then turned to Richard Arkwright 's carding " engine " . By 1795 , Peel 's family run company , Peel & Co . , was the largest in the cotton industry with twenty @-@ three mills around the north west of England , fourteen more than their closest competitor .

 Peel was described as " a tall robust man " with reddish hair , cautious but shrewd , who led the family to fortune through perseverance and resolve . He married Elizabeth Haworth on 28 August 1744 and they had eight children , including Sir Robert Peel , 1st Baronet . Sir Robert Peel went on to father Sir Robert Peel , 2nd Baronet , the future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , who helped to create the modern concept of a police force . Young Robert would visit Parsley Peel and his wife at their home in Ardwick . Douglas Hurd noted that Parsley Peel was satisfied with his lot and did not expect to rise up the social ladder personally , though he hoped his children would . 
 John Wesley said of him , " I was invited to breakfast at Bury by Mr Peel , a calico printer who a few years ago began with £ 500 and is now supposed to have gained £ 20 @,@ 000 . Oh , what a miracle if he lose not his own soul . " In 1794 , Parsley Peel obtained the grant of a coat of arms , including a shuttle held by a lion , a bee signifying business and a new family motto Industria . 
 Towards the end of his life , Peel started to lean heavily on a cane with a golden head . He lived out his final days in Ardwick Green , near his daughter . Peel died on 12 September 1795 , and was buried in St John 's Church , Manchester . His wife survived him by six months ; one of her final wishes was to outlive her husband . He left his estate split equally between his eight children , valued at £ 13 @,@ 000 each ( worth about £ 1 @.@ 1 million in 2013 ) . 
 = Svalbard = 
 Svalbard ( Norwegian pronunciation : [ <unk> ( ː ) <unk> ] ; formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen ) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean . Situated north of mainland Europe , it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole . The islands of the group range from 74 ° to 81 ° north latitude , and from 10 ° to 35 ° east longitude . The largest island is Spitsbergen , followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya . 
 Administratively , the archipelago is not part of any Norwegian county , but forms an unincorporated area administered by a governor appointed by the Norwegian government . Since 2002 , Svalbard 's main settlement , Longyearbyen , has had an elected local government , somewhat similar to mainland municipalities . Other settlements include the Russian mining community of Barentsburg , the research station of Ny @-@ Ålesund , and the mining outpost of Sveagruva . Svalbard is the northernmost settlement in the world with a permanent civilian population . Other settlements are farther north , but are populated only by rotating groups of researchers ; e.g. Alert , Nunavut — the northernmost year @-@ round community . 
 The islands were first taken into use as a whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries , after which they were abandoned . Coal mining started at the beginning of the 20th century , and several permanent communities were established . The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty , and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full part of the Kingdom of Norway . They also established Svalbard as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone . The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol remain the only mining companies in place . Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries , with the University Centre in Svalbard ( UNIS ) and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault playing critical roles . No roads connect the settlements ; instead snowmobiles , aircraft and boats serve inter @-@ community transport . Svalbard Airport , Longyear serves as the main gateway . 
 The archipelago features an Arctic climate , although with significantly higher temperatures than other areas at the same latitude . The flora take advantage of the long period of midnight sun to compensate for the polar night . Svalbard is a breeding ground for many seabirds , and also features polar bears , reindeer , the Arctic fox , and certain marine mammals . Seven national parks and twenty @-@ three nature reserves cover two @-@ thirds of the archipelago , protecting the largely untouched , yet fragile , natural environment . Approximately 60 % of the archipelago is covered with glaciers , and the islands feature many mountains and fjords . 
 Svalbard and Jan Mayen are collectively assigned the ISO 3166 @-@ 1 alpha @-@ 2 country code " SJ " . Both areas are administered by Norway , though they are separated by a distance of over 500 nautical miles ( approximately 600 miles or 950 kilometres ) and have very different administrative structures . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 defines Svalbard as all islands , islets and skerries from 74 ° to 81 ° north latitude , and from 10 ° to 35 ° east longitude . The land area is 61 @,@ 022 km2 ( 23 @,@ 561 sq mi ) , and dominated by the island of Spitsbergen , which constitutes more than half the archipelago , followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya . All settlements are located on Spitsbergen , except the meteorological outposts on Bjørnøya and Hopen . The Norwegian state took possession of all unclaimed land , or 95 @.@ 2 % of the archipelago , at the time the Svalbard Treaty entered into force ; Store Norske owns 4 % , Arktikugol owns 0 @.@ 4 % , while other private owners hold 0 @.@ 4 % . 
 Since Svalbard is located north of the Arctic Circle it experiences midnight sun in summer and polar night in winter . At 74 ° north , the midnight sun lasts 99 days and polar night 84 days , while the respective figures at 81 ° are 141 and 128 days . In Longyearbyen , midnight sun lasts from 20 April until 23 August , and polar night lasts from 26 October to 15 February . In winter , the combination of full moon and reflective snow can give additional light . 
 Glacial ice covers 36 @,@ 502 km2 ( 14 @,@ 094 sq mi ) or 60 % of Svalbard ; 30 % is barren rock while 10 % is vegetated . The largest glacier is <unk> ( 8 @,@ 412 km2 or 3 @,@ 248 sq mi ) on Nordaustlandet , followed by Olav V Land and <unk> . During summer , it is possible to ski from <unk> in the south to the north of Spitsbergen , with only a short distance not being covered by snow or glacier . Kvitøya is 99 @.@ 3 % covered by glacier . 
 The landforms of Svalbard were created through repeated ice ages , when glaciers cut the former plateau into fjords , valleys and mountains . The tallest peak is <unk> ( 1 @,@ 717 m or 5 @,@ 633 ft ) , followed by <unk> ( 1 @,@ 712 m or 5 @,@ 617 ft ) , <unk> ( 1 @,@ 675 m or 5 @,@ 495 ft ) , <unk> ( 1 @,@ 640 m or 5 @,@ 380 ft ) and <unk> ( 1 @,@ 637 m or 5 @,@ 371 ft ) . The longest fjord is Wijdefjorden ( 108 km or 67 mi ) , followed by Isfjorden ( 107 km or 66 mi ) , Van <unk> ( 83 km or 52 mi ) , <unk> ( 64 km or 40 mi ) and <unk> ( 46 km or 29 mi ) . Svalbard is part of the High Arctic Large Igneous Province , and experienced Norway 's strongest earthquake on 6 March 2009 , which hit 6 @.@ 5 on the Richter scale . 
 = = History = = 
 Scandinavians may have discovered Svalbard as early as the 12th century . There are traditional Norse accounts of a land known as <unk> — literally " cold shores " — although this may have referred to Jan Mayen , or a part of eastern Greenland . It was then thought both Svalbard and Greenland were connected to Continental Europe . The archipelago may in that period have been used for fishing and hunting . The Dutchman Willem Barentsz made the first indisputable discovery of the archipelago in 1596 , when he sighted its coast while searching for the Northern Sea Route . 
 The name Spitsbergen originated with Barentsz , who described the " pointed mountains " he saw on the west coast of the main island , although his 1599 map of the Arctic labels the island as Het Niewe Land ( " The New Land " ) . Barentsz did not recognize that he had discovered an archipelago , and consequently the name Spitsbergen long remained in use both for the main island and for the archipelago as a whole . 
 The first known landing on the island dates to 1604 , when an English ship landed at Bjørnøya and started hunting walrus ; annual expeditions soon followed , and Spitsbergen became a base for hunting the bowhead whale from 1611 . Because of the lawless nature of the area , English , Danish , Dutch , and French companies and authorities tried to use force to keep out other countries ' fleets . 
 <unk> was one of the first settlements , established by the Dutch in 1619 . Smaller bases were also built by the English , Danish and French . At first the outposts were merely summer camps , but from the early 1630s , a few individuals started to overwinter . Whaling at Spitsbergen lasted until the 1820s , when the Dutch , British and Danish whalers moved elsewhere in the Arctic . By the late 17th century , Russian hunters arrived ; they overwintered to a greater extent and hunted land mammals such as the polar bear and fox . After British raids into the Barents Sea in 1809 , Russian activity on Svalbard diminished , and ceased by the 1820s . Norwegian hunting — mostly for walrus — started in the 1790s . The first Norwegian citizens to reach Spitsbergen proper were a number of Coast Sámi people from the Hammerfest region , who were hired as part of a Russian crew for an expedition in 1795 . Norwegian whaling was abandoned about the same time as the Russians left , but whaling continued around Spitsbergen until the 1830s , and around Bjørnøya until the 1860s . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 By the 1890s , Svalbard had become a destination for Arctic tourism , coal deposits had been found and the islands were being used as a base for Arctic exploration . The first mining was along Isfjorden by Norwegians in 1899 ; by 1904 , British interests had established themselves in Adventfjorden and started the first all @-@ year operations . Production in Longyearbyen , by American interests , started in 1908 ; and Store Norske established itself in 1916 , as did other Norwegian interests during the war , in part by buying American interests . 
 Discussions to establish the sovereignty of the archipelago commenced in the 1910s , but were interrupted by World War I. On 9 February 1920 , following the Paris Peace Conference , the Svalbard Treaty was signed , granting full sovereignty to Norway . However , all signatory countries were granted non @-@ discriminatory rights to fishing , hunting and mineral resources . The treaty took effect on 14 August 1925 , at the same time as the Svalbard Act regulated the archipelago and the first governor , Johannes <unk> <unk> , took office . The archipelago has traditionally been known as Spitsbergen , and the main island as West Spitsbergen . From the 1920s , Norway renamed the archipelago Svalbard , and the main island became Spitsbergen . Kvitøya , Kong Karls Land , Hopen and Bjørnøya were not regarded as part of the Spitsbergen archipelago . Russians have traditionally called the archipelago Grumant ( <unk> ) . The Soviet Union retained the name Spitsbergen ( <unk> ) to support undocumented claims that Russians were the first to discover the island . In 1928 , Italian explorer Umberto Nobile and the crew of the airship Italia crashed on the <unk> off the coast of Foyn Island . The subsequent rescue attempts were covered extensively in the press and Svalbard received short @-@ lived fame as a result . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 In 1941 , Operation Gauntlet , all Norwegian and Soviet settlements on Svalbard were evacuated , and a German presence was established with a meteorological outpost , although a small Norwegian garrison was kept on Spitsbergen . The German Operation Zitronella took this garrison by force in 1943 , and at the same time destroying the settlements at Longyearbyen and Barentsburg . In September 1944 , together with the supply ship Carl J. Busch , the submarine U @-@ 307 transported the men of Operation <unk> to Svalbard . Operation <unk> ( i.e. , swashbuckler ) was the name of a German operation during the Second World War to establish meteorological stations on Svalbard . The station was active from 9 September 1944 to 4 September 1945 . It lost radio contact in May 1945 , and the soldiers were capable of asking for support only in August 1945 . On 4 September 1945 , the soldiers were picked up by a Norwegian seal hunting vessel and surrendered to its captain . This group of men were the last German troops to surrender after the Second World War . After the war , the Soviet Union proposed common Norwegian and Soviet administration and military defence of Svalbard . This was rejected in 1947 by Norway , which two years later joined NATO . The Soviet Union retained high civilian activity on Svalbard , in part to ensure that the archipelago was not used by NATO .

 After the war , Norway re @-@ established operations at Longyearbyen and Ny @-@ Ålesund , while the Soviet Union established mining in Barentsburg , Pyramiden and Grumant . The mine at Ny @-@ Ålesund had several fatal accidents , killing 71 people while it was in operation from 1945 to 1954 and from 1960 to 1963 . The Kings Bay Affair , caused by the 1962 accident killing 21 workers , forced Gerhardsen 's Third Cabinet to resign . From 1964 , Ny @-@ Ålesund became a research outpost , and a facility for the European Space Research Organisation . Petroleum test drilling was started in 1963 and continued until 1984 , but no commercially viable fields were found . From 1960 , regular charter flights were made from the mainland to a field at Hotellneset ; in 1975 , Svalbard Airport , Longyear opened , allowing year @-@ round services . 
 During the Cold War , the Soviet Union retained about two @-@ thirds of the population on the islands ( with a third being Norwegians ) with the archipelago 's population slightly under 4 @,@ 000 . Russian activity has diminished considerably since then , falling from 2 @,@ 500 to 450 people from 1990 to 2010 . Grumant was closed after it was depleted in 1962 . Pyramiden was closed in 1998 . Coal exports from Barentsburg ceased in 2006 because of a fire , but resumed in 2010 . The Russian community has also experienced two air accidents , Vnukovo Airlines Flight 2801 , which killed 141 people , and the <unk> helicopter accident . 
 Longyearbyen remained purely a company town until 1989 when utilities , culture and education was separated into Svalbard Samfunnsdrift . In 1993 it was sold to the national government and the University Centre was established . Through the 1990s , tourism increased and the town developed an economy independent of Store Norske and the mining . Longyearbyen was incorporated on 1 January 2002 , receiving a community council .

 Longyearbyen is the largest settlement on the archipelago , the seat of the governor and the only town to be incorporated . The town features a hospital , primary and secondary school , university , sports center with a swimming pool , library , culture center , cinema , bus transport , hotels , a bank , and several museums . The newspaper Svalbardposten is published weekly . Only a small fraction of the mining activity remains at Longyearbyen ; instead , workers commute to Sveagruva ( or Svea ) where Store Norske operates a mine . Sveagruva is a dormitory town , with workers commuting from Longyearbyen weekly . 
 Ny @-@ Ålesund is a permanent settlement based entirely around research . Formerly a mining town , it is still a company town operated by the Norwegian state @-@ owned Kings Bay . While there is some tourism there , Norwegian authorities limit access to the outpost to minimize impact on the scientific work . Ny @-@ Ålesund has a winter population of 35 and a summer population of 180 . The Norwegian Meteorological Institute has outposts at Bjørnøya and Hopen , with respectively ten and four people stationed . Both outposts can also house temporary research staff . Poland operates the Polish Polar Station at <unk> , with ten permanent residents . 
 Barentsburg is the only permanently inhabited Russian settlement after Pyramiden was abandoned in 1998 . It is a company town : all facilities are owned by Arktikugol , which operates a coal mine . In addition to the mining facilities , Arktikugol has opened a hotel and souvenir shop , catering for tourists taking day trips or hikes from Longyearbyen . The village features facilities such as a school , library , sports center , community center , swimming pool , farm and greenhouse . Pyramiden features similar facilities ; both are built in typical post @-@ World War II Soviet architectural and planning style and contain the world 's two most northerly Lenin statues and other socialist realism artwork . As of 2013 , a handful of workers are stationed in the largely abandoned Pyramiden to maintain the infrastructure and run the hotel , which has been re @-@ opened for tourists .

 The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago . The islands are , unlike the Norwegian Antarctic Territory , a part of the Kingdom of Norway and not a dependency . The treaty came into effect in 1925 , following the Svalbard Act . All forty signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination , although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation . The treaty limits Norway 's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard . Therefore , Svalbard has a lower income tax than mainland Norway , and there is no value added tax . There is a separate budget for Svalbard to ensure compliance . Svalbard is a demilitarized zone , as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations . Norwegian military activity is limited to fishery surveillance by the Norwegian Coast Guard as the treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment . 
 The Svalbard Act established the institution of the Governor of Svalbard ( Norwegian : <unk> ) , who holds the responsibility as both county governor and chief of police , as well as holding other authority granted from the executive branch . Duties include environmental policy , family law , law enforcement , search and rescue , tourism management , information services , contact with foreign settlements , and judge in some areas of maritime inquiries and judicial examinations — albeit never in the same cases as acting as police . Since 2015 , <unk> <unk> has been governor ; she is assisted by a staff of 26 professionals . The institution is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police , but reports to other ministries in matters within their portfolio . 
 Since 2002 , Longyearbyen Community Council has had many of the same responsibilities of a municipality , including utilities , education , cultural facilities , fire department , roads and ports . No care or nursing services are available , nor is welfare payment available . Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities . The hospital is part of University Hospital of North Norway , while the airport is operated by state @-@ owned Avinor . Ny @-@ Ålesund and Barentsburg remain company towns with all infrastructure owned by Kings Bay and Arktikugol , respectively . Other public offices with presence on Svalbard are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining , the Norwegian Polar Institute , the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway . Svalbard is subordinate to Nord @-@ Troms District Court and Hålogaland Court of Appeal , both located in Tromsø . 
 Although Norway is part of the European Economic Area ( EEA ) and the Schengen Agreement , Svalbard is not part of the Schengen Area or the EEA . Non @-@ Norwegian Svalbard residents do not need Schengen visas , but are prohibited from reaching Svalbard from mainland Norway without such . In theory it would be possible to do a visa @-@ free airport transit at Oslo Airport , but this is not allowed by Norway . People without a source of income can be rejected by the governor . No person is required visa or residence permit for Svalbard . Everybody can live and work in Svalbard indefinitely regardless of citizenship . Svalbard Treaty grants treaty nationals equal right of abode as Norwegian nationals . So far , non @-@ treaty nationals were admitted visa @-@ free as well . " Regulations concerning rejection and expulsion from Svalbard " in force . Russia retains a consulate in Barentsburg . 
 In September 2010 a treaty was made between Russia and Norway fixing the boundary between the Svalbard archipelago and the Novaya Zemlya archipelago . Increased interest in petroleum exploration in the Arctic raised interest in a resolution of the dispute . The agreement takes into account the relative positions of the archipelagos , rather than being based simply on northward extension of the continental border of Norway and Russia . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The three main industries on Svalbard are coal mining , tourism , and research . In 2007 , there were 484 people working in the mining sector , 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector . The same year , the mining gave a revenue of NOK 2 @.@ 008 billion ( 227 @,@ 791 @,@ 078 USD ) , tourism NOK 317 million ( 35 @,@ 967 @,@ 202 USD ) and research NOK 142 million ( 16 @,@ 098 @,@ 404 USD ) In 2006 , the average income for economically active people was NOK 494 @,@ 700 — 23 % higher than on the mainland . Almost all housing is owned by the various employers and institutions and rented to their employees ; there are only a few privately owned houses , most of which are recreational cabins . Because of this , it is nearly impossible to live on Svalbard without working for an established institution . 
 Since the resettlement of Svalbard in the early 20th century , coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity . Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani , a subsidiary of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry , operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen . The former produced 3 @.@ 4 million tonnes in 2008 , while the latter uses 35 % of its output to Longyearbyen Power Station . Since 2007 , there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state @-@ owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg . There have previously been performed test drilling for petroleum on land , but these did not give satisfactory results for permanent operation . The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum activities for environmental reasons , and the land formerly test @-@ drilled on has been protected as natural reserves or national parks . In 2011 , a 20 @-@ year plan to develop offshore oil and gas resources around Svalbard was announced . 
 Svalbard has historically been a base for both whaling and fishing . Norway claimed a 200 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) around Svalbard in 1977 , with 31 @,@ 688 square kilometres ( 12 @,@ 235 sq mi ) of internal waters and 770 @,@ 565 square kilometres ( 297 @,@ 517 sq mi ) of EEZ . Norway retains a restrictive fisheries policy in the zone , and the claims are disputed by Russia . Tourism is focused on the environment and is centered on Longyearbyen . Activities include hiking , kayaking , walks through glacier caves and snowmobile and dog @-@ sled safari . Cruise ships generate a significant portion of the traffic , including both stops by offshore vessels and expeditionary cruises starting and ending in Svalbard . Traffic is strongly concentrated between March and August ; overnights have quintupled from 1991 to 2008 , when there were 93 @,@ 000 guest @-@ nights . 
 Research on Svalbard centers on Longyearbyen and Ny @-@ Ålesund , the most accessible areas in the high Arctic . The treaty grants permission for any nation to conduct research on Svalbard , resulting in the Polish Polar Station and the Chinese Arctic Yellow River Station , plus Russian facilities in Barentsburg . The University Centre in Svalbard in Longyearbyen offers undergraduate , graduate and postgraduate courses to 350 students in various arctic sciences , particularly biology , geology and geophysics . Courses are provided to supplement studies at the mainland universities ; there are no tuition fees and courses are held in English , with Norwegian and international students equally represented . 
 The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a seedbank to store seeds from as many of the world 's crop varieties and their botanical wild relatives as possible . A cooperation between the government of Norway and the Global Crop Diversity Trust , the vault is cut into rock near Longyearbyen , keeping it at a natural − 6 ° C ( 21 ° F ) and refrigerating the seeds to − 18 ° C ( 0 ° F ) . 
 The Svalbard Undersea Cable System is a 1 @,@ 440 km ( 890 mi ) fibre optic line from Svalbard to Harstad , needed for communicating with polar orbiting satellites through Svalbard Satellite Station and installations in Ny @-@ Ålesund . 
 One source of income for the area is visiting cruise ships . The Norwegian government has become concerned in recent years about large numbers of cruise ship passengers suddenly landing at small settlements such as Ny @-@ Ålesund , which is conveniently close to the barren @-@ yet @-@ picturesque Magdalena Fjord . With the increasing size of the larger ships , up to 2000 people can potentially appear in a community that normally numbers less than 40 . The government has recently passed legislation , effective from January 2014 , severely restricting the size of cruise ships that may visit . 
 = = Transport = = 
 Within Longyearbyen , Barentsburg , and Ny @-@ Ålesund , there are road systems , but they do not connect with each other . Off @-@ road motorized transport is prohibited on bare ground , but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter — both for commercial and recreational activities . Transport from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg ( 45 km or 28 mi ) and Pyramiden ( 100 km or 62 mi ) is possible by snowmobile by winter , or by ship all year round . All settlements have ports and Longyearbyen has a bus system . 
 Svalbard Airport , Longyear , located 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) from Longyearbyen , is the only airport offering air transport off the archipelago . Scandinavian Airlines has daily scheduled services to Tromsø and Oslo . Low @-@ cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle also has a service between Oslo and Svalbard , operating three or four times a week ; there are also irregular charter services to Russia . Finnair has announced to commence service to Helsinki , operating three times a week starting June 1 , 2016 and lasting until 27 August 2016 , but Norwegian authorities did not allow this route as it was not in bilateral agreement on air traffic between Finland and Norway . Lufttransport provides regular corporate charter services from Longyearbyen to Ny @-@ Ålesund Airport and Svea Airport for Kings Bay and Store Norske ; these flights are in general not available to the public . There are heliports in Barentsburg and Pyramiden , and helicopters are frequently used by the governor and to a lesser extent the mining company Arktikugol . 
 = = Climate = = 
 The climate of Svalbard is dominated by its high latitude , with the average summer temperature at 4 to 6 ° C ( 39 to 43 ° F ) and January averages at − 16 to − 12 ° C ( 3 to 10 ° F ) . The West Spitsbergen Current , the northernmost branch of the North Atlantic Current system , moderates Svalbard 's temperatures , particularly during winter . Winter temperatures in Svalbard are up to − 20 ° C ( − 36 ° F ) higher than similar latitudes in Russia and Canada . The warm Atlantic water keeps the surrounding waters open and navigable most of the year . The interior fjord areas and valleys , sheltered by the mountains , have larger temperature differences than the coast , giving about 2 ° C ( 4 ° F ) warmer summer temperatures and 3 ° C ( 5 ° F ) colder winter temperatures . On the south of Spitsbergen , the temperature is slightly higher than further north and west . During winter , the temperature difference between south and north is typically 5 ° C ( 9 ° F ) , and about 3 ° C ( 5 ° F ) in summer . Bear Island has average temperatures even higher than the rest of the archipelago . 
 Svalbard is where cold polar air from the north and mild , wet sea air from the south meet , creating low pressure , changeable weather and strong winds , particularly in winter ; in January , a strong breeze is registered 17 % of the time at Isfjord Radio , but only 1 % of the time in July . In summer , particularly away from land , fog is common , with visibility under 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) registered 20 % of the time in July and 1 % of the time in January , at Hopen and Bjørnøya . Precipitation is frequent , but falls in small quantities , typically less than 400 millimetres ( 16 in ) per year in western Spitsbergen . More rain falls on the uninhabited east side , where there can be more than 1 @,@ 000 millimetres ( 39 in ) .
