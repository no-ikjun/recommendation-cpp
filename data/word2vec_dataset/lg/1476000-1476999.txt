 " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " was generally commended by contemporary music critics . In his review for Rainbow , Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic named the song one of the album 's top three picks . Danyel Smith from Entertainment Weekly called the song the " emotional center of the album " and wrote " There 's a light in me / That shines brightly , she sings . The song ( co @-@ written with Diane Warren and co @-@ produced with Jam and Lewis ) resonates with new life experience — a kind of truth and uplift . " Elysa Gardner , editor from the Los Angeles Times , called the song " earnestly passionate " and felt Carey sounded her " most impressive " on the song . Amy Linden from Vibe also reviewed the song positively , calling Carey 's vocal performance in the song " emotional " and " graceful . " Additionally , Linden wrote " It could very well be Carey 's version of Nas ' " Hate Me Now " ; she makes it through all the trials and tribulations undaunted . "

 The release of the song as a single was surrounded by conflict between Carey and Sony Music Entertainment . Due to Billboard rules at the time of the song 's release , charting credit was not given to " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " but to " Crybaby " , the song it shared a double A @-@ side with . The song managed to chart on the dance single in the United States , reaching the top ten on the Hot Dance Club Play chart . Due to the song 's weak promotional release , it was not released together with " Crybaby " outside the United States , where it performed poorly due to its radio @-@ only premiere . It charted for one week in Belgium ( Wallonia ) , where it peaked at number forty on the official singles chart . Similarly in the Netherlands , " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " peaked at number sixty @-@ five on the Dutch Singles Chart , however spending nine weeks fluctuating in the chart .

 Two music videos were shot for " Can 't Take That Away , " both directed by Sanaa Hamri in New York City . The creation of the video involved some of Carey 's fans : two weeks prior to filming , they were invited via her website to send in video clips of themselves , telling her of the hardships in their lives and how the song had inspired them to look at life differently , and had given them strength . A contest was held , and video clips from five fans were chosen for inclusion in the video . The clips were featured in the video 's introduction , where Carey reacts to her fan 's struggles which included personal insecurities , the problems of being part of a racial or social minority , and being victimized by verbal harassment . 
 The original edit of the music video begins with a message to those fans that sent in their videos ; " Thank you to all those who chose to share their stories with the world . " Subsequently , a personal message left by Carey is shown , reading " After every storm , if you look hard enough , a rainbow appears ... " Five testimonials from fans are shown , each telling of their own personal problems and hardships . In her testimonial , the third girl says " I am fourteen years old , I 'm a high school student , there is not one day that goes by that people don 't make fun of me about my race . Its is about self @-@ confidence , don 't be afraid to dream . " After the last girl reads her message , Carey is shown lying on a sofa in her living room , watching a television . As she sadly sings , she watched as different empowering messages and events are shown on the screen . Of them , one shows Lance Armstrong riding a bicycle on the Tour de France , reading " Lance Armstrong overcame cancer and won the Tour de France in 1999 . " After the next scene , Carey is shown sitting on the sofa , with tears in her eyes , as they slowly escape her . During the end of the bridge , where she sings , " Certainly the Lord will guide me , " Carey stands from the floor , and exits onto a large balcony overlooking the city . Rain begins to fall while Carey waves her arms as she cries out . Her depression is resolved when the rain stops and a rainbow forms , prompting her to smile . 
 The video was quickly pulled after its release because it contained some technical errors . The clips of the people on Carey 's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background , making it difficult to read . There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene , as Carey 's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry . Consequently , a new music video was completed , which retained the clips of Carey 's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage . Carey , now in a new and more furnished apartment , does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room . She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles , singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song . As with the previous filming of the video , Carey 's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow , shown at the end of the video . 
 Most remixes of " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " were released in the US only , although few were found in certain territories . David Morales produced the Morales club mix , which uses the song 's original vocals with similar chord progressions to those of the original , and the Morales Triumphant mix , which contains re @-@ recorded vocals and new lyrics which transform the song into a jazz @-@ like mix with harmonica sections . A spoken introduction was also added , featuring Carey 's spoken voice before the first verse . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 Although " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " was never fully released as a single , Carey felt very strongly about the song and therefore promoted it through several live television and award show appearances . Carey 's first live performance of the song was on The Today Show as part of a mini @-@ concert which aired live on November 2 , 1999 , from Rockefeller Center in New York . Following the concert on The Today Show , Carey performed the song live at the 2000 Blockbuster Entertainment Awards , where she was presented as a featured performer . After the release of " Against All Odds ( Take a Look at Me Now ) " , the album 's final single , Carey sang them both live on The View in mid @-@ 2000 . On October 30 , 1999 , Carey filmed a private concert held at her old high school in Huntington , Long Island , where she taped a special for the Fox Broadcasting Company titled Mariah Carey Homecoming Special , which aired in December of that year . Aside from television performances , the song was part of the set @-@ list on both the Rainbow World Tour , which coincided with the release and promotion of Rainbow , as well as the Charmbracelet World Tour in 2002 – 03 . She has performed the song recently in her last two concerts in Marrakech , Morocco , and at the Mawazine Festival , and Monaco . The remix version was the opening number for her concerts in Australia during January 2013 .

 = Pennsylvania Route 115 = 
 Pennsylvania Route 115 ( PA 115 ) is a 35 @.@ 7 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 57 @.@ 5 km ) north – south state highway in eastern Pennsylvania . It stretches from U.S. Route 209 ( US 209 ) in Brodheadsville , Monroe County to Interstate 81 ( I @-@ 81 ) and PA 309 near Wilkes @-@ Barre in Luzerne County . PA 115 passes through rural areas along its route , intersecting PA 903 in Tunkhannock Township , I @-@ 80 and PA 940 in Tobyhanna Township , and I @-@ 476 ( Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension ) in Bear Creek Township . The road serves as a connector between The Poconos and the Wyoming Valley . 
 The road originated as the Sullivan Trail , a route that follows the path taken by General John Sullivan during his expedition in the American Revolutionary War . The Sullivan Trail later became known as the Easton and Wilkes @-@ Barre Turnpike , a turnpike that connected Easton and Wilkes @-@ Barre between 1815 and the 1850s . PA 115 was designated in 1928 to run from Montoursville east to Swiftwater ; the route was designated PA 15 for a year prior to that . In 1935 , the east end was realigned from Swiftwater to Saylorsburg . By 1937 , the termini were moved from Montoursville to Mausdale and from Saylorsburg to Easton . PA 115 was extended west to Milton by 1950 . The northern terminus was realigned to Hughesville by 1960 , the same time a portion of the route from Saylorsburg to Wind Gap was relocated to a freeway alignment . PA 115 's northern terminus was cut back to the Wilkes @-@ Barre area in 1961 . The southern terminus was rolled back to Brodheadsville by 1972 . PA 115 has had its northern terminus in various locations in the Wilkes @-@ Barre area from 1962 to 1990 ; finally being moved to its current location in 1990 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 PA 115 begins at a Y intersection with US 209 in the community of Brodheadsville in <unk> Township , Monroe County . From this intersection , the route heads northwest as a two @-@ lane undivided road , passing through business areas before heading into a mix of farmland and woodland with some development . The road passes through the community of Effort and curves to the north . PA 115 gains a second northbound lane and continues into forested areas with residential neighborhoods , turning to the northwest and entering Tunkhannock Township . The route narrows back to two lanes and runs through more dense forests . The road passes to the southwest of Pocono Raceway before it curves more to the west and meets the northern terminus of PA 903 . PA 115 heads northwest again through more forested areas with some development prior to crossing into Tobyhanna Township . Here , the route immediately reaches an interchange with I @-@ 80 at exit 284 , at which point it widens into a four @-@ lane divided highway . After the interchange , PA 115 narrows back into a two @-@ lane undivided road and crosses Tobyhanna Creek . The route crosses PA 940 in the community of Blakeslee , at which point it passes a few businesses . Following this intersection , the road heads back through forests . 
 PA 115 crosses the Lehigh River into Buck Township in Luzerne County , where the name of the road becomes Buck Boulevard . The route passes through more dense forest , curving more to the west and entering Bear Creek Township in the community of Shades Glen . The road becomes Bear Creek Boulevard and continues west , entering the borough of Bear Creek Village . Here , PA 115 gains a center left @-@ turn lane and heads through wooded areas of homes , passing to the south of Bear Creek Lake . The route heads northwest and becomes the border between Bear Creek Village to the northeast and Bear Creek Township to the southwest , with the turn lane disappearing and the road gaining a second southbound lane . The route fully enters Bear Creek Township again , where it turns back into a three @-@ lane road with a center left @-@ turn lane and passes near some residential neighborhoods , turning to the north . 
 PA 115 curves northwest and comes to a ramp that provides access to I @-@ 476 ( Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension ) at exit 105 . The route becomes a wide two @-@ lane road and runs parallel to I @-@ 476 to the west as it descends Wyoming Mountain . The road curves northeast before a turn to the northwest , where it passes under I @-@ 476 . PA 115 continues north through forests with some homes , passing through <unk> Corners . The route enters Plains Township and passes over a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line as it winds through more dense forests as a four @-@ lane divided highway . PA 115 turns to the west and passes south of commercial development before it comes to its northern terminus at an interchange with I @-@ 81 and PA 309 at exit 170 outside of Wilkes @-@ Barre . Past this interchange , the roadway continues west as the limited @-@ access North Cross Valley Expressway , which is part of PA 309 .

 Most of what became PA 115 from Easton to Wilkes @-@ Barre was originally a pathway made by General John Sullivan and his forces in 1779 during the American Revolutionary War on their expedition from Easton to the Wyoming Valley . George Washington ordered Sullivan to march upstream the Susquehanna River to join General James Clinton 's brigade at the Bradford County town of Tioga ( now known as Athens ) . Soon after , Sullivan 's army departed to Newtown , New York where they defeated the Iroquois and Cayuga Indians living in Western New York . His campaign was one of the most important military movements in the American Revolution . The southernmost segment of General Sullivan 's path which became part of PA 115 centuries later from Knox Avenue in Easton to PA 512 in Wind Gap is currently designated as Sullivan Trail . 
 At the turn of the 19th century , the population and economy of Luzerne County continued to grow and there was a necessity for new roads to improve communication between distant settlements . Most of the early merchandise transportation in the area was done by Durham boats on the Lehigh and Susquehanna Rivers . This led Arnold Colt , a Luzerne County clerk , to construct a turnpike directly connecting the Wyoming and Lehigh Valleys on Sullivan 's Trail . Colt then obtained a charter to incorporate the Easton and Wilkes @-@ Barre Turnpike on February 11 , 1803 . The first 46 miles ( 74 km ) of the turnpike from Wilkes @-@ Barre to Wind Gap were finished by 1807 . Colt then obtained a charter to incorporate the Easton and Wilkes @-@ Barre Turnpike on February 11 , 1803 . The road was completed by 1815 at a total expense of $ 75 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 970 thousand in 2016 ) . 
 The turnpike was initially used as major thoroughfare for conveying grains and plaster during War of 1812 . When Northampton County farmers could not afford shipped plaster from the Eastern seaboard they became interested in New York plaster . The plaster was transported from New York via the Susquehanna River then onto the turnpike on wagons and sleds . Transporting this product became the turnpike 's legacy as it transformed the road into an important commercial line . 
 By the 1850s , the transport industry heavily favored trains over wagons and sleds . In 1851 , the Lackawanna and Western Railroad was completed , connecting Scranton to upstate New York . The new railroad shortened the time required to ship goods between the two endpoints from ten days ( by way of roads ) to just one . The amount of traffic on the turnpike declined as a result . By the 1850s , the turnpike company had folded and the highway was abandoned . From Bear Creek to Tobyhanna Township the name Easton and Wilkes @-@ Barre Road is still marked on PA 115 . The former southern extension of PA 115 from Brodheadsville to Wind Gap is marked as the Wilkes @-@ Barre Turnpike . 
 = = = Designation = = = 
 When Pennsylvania began maintenance over roads by the way of the Sproul Road Bill in May 1911 , the Luzerne County portion of present @-@ day PA 115 was adopted as Legislative Route 169 ( LR 169 ) , the primary connector between Wilkes @-@ Barre and the Poconos . The former southernmost segment of the route from Saylorsburg to Easton was adopted as LR 166 . The first traffic routes were assigned in 1924 and by 1927 , the state had assigned LR 169 as PA 15 only to be renumbered the following year as PA 115 . 
 When PA 115 was commissioned in 1928 , the road was mostly aligned east – west and stretched from US 220 in Montoursville to US 611 in Swiftwater near Mount Pocono . In April 1935 , the southern terminus of PA 115 was moved from Mount Pocono to PA 12 in Saylorsburg , following the Effort Mountain road connecting Wilkes @-@ Barre with Easton . The former alignment of PA 115 from Tobyhanna Township to Swiftwater was replaced by PA 940 , which is now PA 940 between Tobyhanna Township and Pocono Summit and PA 314 between Pocono Summit and Swiftwater . By 1937 , the southern terminus of PA 115 extended to US 611 in Easton . The new route followed the Sullivan Trail and replaced PA 102 between Easton and <unk> . The same year , the northern terminus was moved from Montoursville to PA 54 in the Montour County community of Mausdale . The route replaced a part of PA 154 between Mausdale and Jerseytown , all of PA 439 between Jerseytown and Benton , and a part of PA 339 between Benton and Coles Creek . The former alignment of PA 115 between Montoursville and Coles Creek became PA 87 between Montoursville and Forksville and PA 154 between Forksville and Coles Creek . This alignment retains these designations today except that PA 154 has been removed between Laporte and Coles Creek . 
 By 1950 , PA 115 was extended west to PA 14 ( currently PA 405 ) in Milton , replacing a portion of PA 154 between Milton and <unk> and a portion of PA 45 between <unk> and Mausdale . Also , a new alignment of PA 115 between Lehman and PA 415 in Dallas was proposed . The northern terminus was moved from Milton to US 220 in Hughesville during the 1950s ; this stretch replaced a portion of PA 642 . The former alignment of PA 115 between Milton and Red Rock became PA 642 between Milton and Jerseytown and PA 254 between Jerseytown and Red Rock . This alignment is now PA 642 , PA 254 between Jerseytown and Benton , and PA 487 between Benton and Red Rock . In addition , the route was moved to its new alignment between Lehman and Dallas , where it turned southeast and picked up a concurrency with US 309 . By 1960 , PA 115 was moved onto a freeway ( now PA 33 ) from Saylorsburg to PA 512 in Wind Gap . 
 In April 1961 , the northern terminus of PA 115 was moved from Hughesville to US 309 ( now PA 309 Business ) in Wilkes @-@ Barre Township , with the route replaced by PA 118 between Hughesville and Dallas . This change was made in order to eliminate the concurrency with US 309 between Dallas and Wilkes @-@ Barre Township and to give the east @-@ west portion between Hughesville and Dallas an even route number . In Wilkes @-@ Barre , it used to follow Kidder Street , Butler Street , Main Street , Courtright Street , Carey Avenue , and crossed the Susquehanna River on Pierce Street . 
 By 1972 , the southern terminus was truncated from Easton to its current location . The portion of PA 115 's former surface alignment in Northampton County between Center Square in Easton and PA 191 in <unk> is now designated as State Route 2025 , an unsigned quadrant route . PA 115 was extended back to its former alignments by 1980 via Kidder , Scott , Butler , and Pierce Streets through Wilkes @-@ Barre and ended at US 11 in Kingston . The route was truncated to PA 309 at the intersection of Kidder and Spring Streets in Wilkes @-@ Barre by 1989 . A year later , the northern terminus was moved to its current location when the North Cross Valley Expressway ( PA 309 ) was completed .

 = Seara ( newspaper ) = 
 Seara ( Romanian pronunciation : [ <unk> ̯ ara ] , meaning " The Evening " ) was a daily newspaper published in Bucharest , Romania , before and during World War I. Owned by politician Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino and , through most of its existence , managed by the controversial Alexandru Bogdan @-@ Pitești , it was an unofficial and unorthodox tribune for the Conservative Party . Its involvement in politics sparked numerous scandals , the longest of which came during the neutrality period ( 1914 – 1916 ) . Strongly anti @-@ Slavic , Seara stood out in that context for supporting the German Empire and Central Powers , and was widely alleged of having been financed by a German propaganda machine . In 1914 , it was purchased by German businessmen , but continued to register mediocre success in comparison with its pro @-@ Entente competitors . In late 1916 , after Romania decided in favor of the Entente , Seara was disestablished . 
 Noted for publishing the biting satirical pieces and art chronicles of Tudor Arghezi , Seara was closely associated with the Romanian Symbolist movement . Through Arghezi , Bogdan @-@ Pitești and other contributors , it campaigned in favor Symbolism and , after 1913 , popularized modern art . Although paying tribute to political conservatism throughout its existence , Seara was also home to anti @-@ establishment contributors , allies in the anti @-@ Entente cause . The newspaper sympathized with the Social Democratic Party , regularly hosting opinion pieces by socialists and anarchists . 
 = = Before 1914 = = 
 = = = Beginnings = = = 
 Like the daily Minerva , Seara was originally a creation of G. G. Cantacuzino , the Romanian magnate . Cantacuzino , who supported the Conservative Party inner faction of Alexandru Marghiloman , refrained from attaching his name to Seara , later entrusting Bogdan @-@ Pitești with the position of manager . In 1910 , the year of its foundation , Seara also followed the Conservative <unk> Petre P. Carp and Nicolae Filipescu , supporting Carp 's strict monarchism and suggesting that the " <unk> @-@ <unk> " line was one of moral superiority . 
 Early in its existence , Seara reported on various events agitating public opinion , such as the Romanian Orthodox Church division between the traditionalists and those who supported communion with Rome . In one of its first issues , it hosted a disclaimer by Roman Catholic <unk> Joseph Baud , who calmed enraged Orthodox believers by assuring them that their Metropolitan Bishop Iosif <unk> had not died a Catholic . Later , Seara gave significant coverage to what it called " scandals in the Vatican " , particularly so in the 1911 controversy surrounding Father <unk> 's conversion to Methodism ; this prompted the Romanian Catholic press to list Seara among those newspapers " at odds with Christian ideas " . 
 At that stage in its history , Seara was also sympathetic to the cause of ethnic Romanians living abroad , in Transylvania and other regions of Austria @-@ Hungary : in August 1911 , it sent special correspondents to cover the congress of Romanian activist groups in <unk> ( Blaj ) . The newspaper also reported with disapproval on the growth of nationalism among the Hungarians , covering for a Romanian public the division of Hungarian Socialists along pro- and anti @-@ nationalist politics , and accusing the Károly <unk> @-@ <unk> administration of subverting the Romanian National Party ( PNR ) . Seara 's articles gave exposure to the PNR 's official reaction , as voiced by that party 's speaker Alexandru Vaida @-@ Voevod . It called Vaida @-@ Voevod " one of the [ PNR 's ] brilliant leaders " , responsible " to a great extent for the rescue of party discipline and national solidarity " . 
 In March of the next year , Seara published an homage to journalist and ideologue Constantin Stere , noted for having brought back together the two factions of the PNR , and concluded : " Mr. C. Stere , although involved in our country 's partisan politics , [ ... ] has transmitted to our quarrelsome brothers a peace message from all of us , proving that the foremost preoccupation of our minds is and will be national solidarity , the pure love for the holy cause of <unk> . " It later discussed the conflict between PNR politicians and <unk> @-@ <unk> 's successor , László Lukács . In his reply to the PNR ( paraphrased by Seara ) , Lukács equated the Romanians ' political emancipation in Transylvania with militant irredentism , and prophesied that Transylvania was in real danger of being invaded by the Kingdom of Romania . Seara retorted by accusing Lukács of supporting " preemptive " Magyarization in " the multilingual Kingdom of Hungary " . 
 The paper was also taking an interest in the political affairs of the Balkans . Shortly before the Balkan Wars , it published the appeal of Simion , a Greek Romanian politician and editor of Bucharest 's Patris gazette , who gathered support for a Greco – Romanian alliance against the South Slavs . Simion posited that Romania and the Kingdom of Greece would eventually reach an understanding over the litigious issue of Aromanian nationhood , and blamed the conflict on " shrewd " Slavic meddling . 
 = = = Moderate Symbolism = = = 
 Seara also made known its artistic credo , placing itself in the margin of Romanian Symbolism . According to art historian Dan Grigorescu , its awareness of European literature and its cultural effervescence , like those of <unk> , <unk> and other Romanian periodicals with special cultural pages , were impressive . Up to April 1911 ( when he was made director of the National Theater Bucharest ) , Ioan Bacalbașa was Seara 's theater columnist . According to his colleagues in the Transylvanian press , Bacalbașa 's columns for Seara and Epoca were a courageous defense of national literature . 
 During his time at Seara , Bacalbașa was seconded by poet Dumitru Karnabatt , later a political chronicler for the same newspaper . Karnabatt introduced the stage work of Henry Bataille ( Issue 271 / 1910 ) and the Aestheticism of Oscar Wilde ( editorial piece , Issue 52 , 1910 ) . Elsewhere ( Issue 425 / 1911 ) , Seara covered the hitherto supposed discovery of an unknown novel by Honoré de Balzac . Around that time , Karnabatt 's own literary contributions for Seara were samples of Symbolist , Decadent and Impressionist travel writing , sometimes written together with his novelist wife Lucrezzia . 
 Lucrezzia stopped writing for the paper in 1911 , probably as a result of conflicts she had with Bogdan @-@ Pitești , her marriage to Dumitru on the brink of failure . Sometimes signing as " Don Ramiro " , Dumitru remained affiliated with Seara , and in charge of its artistic policies . The newspaper 's traditional conservatism was still being reflected in its artistic choices . During late 1910 , Karnabatt gave poor reviews to the more rebellious Symbolist painters to emerge from the <unk> <unk> salon , and deemed the primitivist sculptor Constantin Brâncuși a madman . 
 In January 1911 , the same author used the newspaper to publicize his dislike of Futurism , a modern art and anti @-@ establishment current originating in Italy . Reviewing the Futurist Manifesto , he called for " demented " author Filippo Tommaso Marinetti to be " tied down " . Karnabatt further proposed that Marinetti 's exacerbated modernism was an atavistic manifestation of the Barbarian Invasions : " an absurd heredity within the Italian people , this people of art and of idealism " . Closely following similar developments in French culture , Seara supported Jean Richepin 's protest against " excessive modernism " and the division of labor . The pro @-@ Richepin article , signed by Prince Constantin de <unk> , saw print in Issue 53 / 1911 . 
 In Decadent spirit , Karnabatt 's essays in Seara advocate a reevaluation of Rococo and fête galante aesthetics . He was revolted by " the horrors of contemporary painting " — Pissarro , Monet , etc . — , citing as his reference " the fine and erudite art critic , the independent and courageous " Sâr Péladan ( who was , incidentally , Bogdan @-@ Pitești 's mentor ) . In a September issue , " Don Ramiro " Karnabatt declared himself horrified that some were proposing to honor the inveterate gambler <unk> with a public monument , announcing that France had given in to " vice " . By then , he was giving positive reviews to " decadent poets " of the " dead cities " ( Georges <unk> , Dimitrie Anghel ) , and enthusiastic about the establishment of community theaters to promote a " noble and pure art " , away from " the platitudes and pettiness of modern life " . 
 In Seara , " Don Ramiro " was also contributing to the publicity campaigns mounted by Symbolist doyen Alexandru Macedonski and by Macedonski 's painter son , Alexis . For Karnabatt , their contribution to Symbolism was a horizon " of violent and tormented passion " . Seara 's support for Macedonski 's cosmopolitanism earned Karnabatt criticism from the anti @-@ Symbolist Transylvanians . 
 = = = Blackmail scandals = = = 
 During spring 1913 , Cantacuzino formally liquidated his business , and Bogdan @-@ Pitești was officially installed as manager of Seara . According to the rival satirical magazine <unk> , although Seara was " stillborn " when it came to commercial success , the move was intriguing for the reading public . The conservative principles stated by Cantacuzino seemed largely incompatible with the radical activism that had made Bogdan @-@ Pitești a mistrusted public figure . Bogdan @-@ Pitești , whose background was in French anarchism , announced that the new editorial line centered on some of Cantacuzino 's bugbears : universal suffrage , feminism , land reform , Jewish emancipation etc . In March of that year , Seara was also joined by a most fervent contributor , the poet and <unk> Arghezi . 
 Although supporting the Conservative Party before and after that moment , Seara was focusing its efforts on attacking the Conservative @-@ Democratic Party of Take Ionescu , with whom the Conservative Premier Titu Maiorescu had formed a coalition ( one resented by Cantacuzino and Bogdan @-@ Pitești ) . In this context , critic Ion Vianu notes , Seara became " an aggressive publication , with a history of base attacks and blackmail . " The anti @-@ Ionescu discourse was notably outlined in an Arghezi article of September 11 , 1913 . It collectively and disparagingly identified the Conservative @-@ Democrats ( or <unk> ) as ciocoi ( " upstarts " ) , accusing them of having repressed in blood the 1907 peasant revolt : " They are the symbol of 1907 , when , his arms , chest , shoulders and back loaded with ravens , with ciocoi , the peasant tore himself away from his field , split himself , fought to chase them away and [ ... ] fell down murdered by the claws that clutched down , tore down into his flesh and reached inside to his soul and killed it as well . These ciocoi , we will eradicate . " In a 1913 issue , Romanian Land Forces General Ștefan <unk> referred to Ionescu 's men as <unk> de Curtea @-@ Veche ( " the Old Court rakes " ) , another colloquialism for " upstarts " . 
 One of Seara 's prime targets was Public Works Minister Alexandru Bădărău , called " filthy con man " , accused of taking massive bribes from American investors in Romanian oil and of employing in his staff some 150 women in exchange for sexual favors . Nicolae Titulescu , the young Conservative Democrat politician and bureaucrat , was ridiculed for having acquired , through his foreign connections , an original tapestry from the <unk> Manufactory . Notably , senior politician Nicolae Fleva lent his pen to these allegations , writing in Seara that Bădărău had serious psychiatric problems . Documenting Bogdan @-@ Pitești 's Catholic faith and Arghezi 's anticlericalism , Seara lampooned the Orthodox Church , and was discredited as the offshoot of " Papist propaganda " . 
 According to literary critics such as Barbu Cioculescu and Vianu , Seara may have had for its informant the Symbolist writer Mateiu Caragiale — a client of Bogdan @-@ Pitești 's , he had become a chief of staff for Bădărău . In diaries he kept after his split with Bogdan @-@ Pitești , Caragiale himself alleged that Seara 's publisher was being paid to harass " without pity , in biting manner , all those whom Cantacuzino would grace with his unfriendliness or antipathy " , in particular the Conservative @-@ Democrats . Although he never signed articles for Seara , Caragiale was by then receiving regular payments from its patrons . 
 At the peak of Cantacuzino 's negative campaign against the Conservative @-@ Democrats , Seara also attacked private enterprises , including the <unk> Blank Bank . Bogdan @-@ Pitești was taken to court by owner Aristide Blank , and N. Fleva organized his defense . According to the records kept by Caragiale , Blank effectively set a " trap " with the cooperation of Romanian Police , and Bogdan @-@ Pitești , found guilty of blackmail , was sentenced to nine months in prison . Seara fared badly during the period , and was out of print by autumn 1913 . 
 = = = Modernist platform = = = 
 Before and after the 1913 hiatus , with Bogdan @-@ Pitești and Arghezi at its helm , Seara expanded its range , encouraging the development of modernist literature , and playing a part in the transition from Romanian Symbolism to 20th century avant @-@ garde . Its art chronicles celebrated the international success of modern artists Constantin Brâncuși and <unk> , both of whom , Seara argued , were culturally tied to Romania . Revising its stance , the newspaper published Arghezi 's account of the new <unk> <unk> modern art exhibit ( April 1913 ) , mentioning Bogdan @-@ Pitești 's role as an art patron and instigator of change . The two intellectuals also promoted the works by young artist Theodor Pallady , most notably with a series of articles in which Arghezi spoke about Pallady paintings in the Bogdan @-@ Pitești collection . The magazine , already noted for publishing political cartoons by Nicolae Petrescu Găină , was also joined by Marcel Janco , known later for his work as a Dada and Constructivist artist . 
 During those years , Seara also enlisted two poets formerly affiliated with Simbolul review : the Imagist Adrian Maniu and the experimental Symbolist Ion Vinea . By summer 1914 , the latter 's articles included jibes against the moderate Symbolist figure Ovid Densusianu , ridiculing his disciples at Versuri și Proză magazine ( the beginning of a dispute which Vinea would pursue in more depth during his time at Chemarea magazine ) . In addition to poetry and prose fragments , Vinea was assigned a regular column about life in Bucharest . Also published by Seara was the Symbolist George Bacovia , with poetry pieces such as " Winter Lead " , " Autumn Nerves " and " Poem in the Mirror " — generally second editions , previously published in Noua Revistă Română and other reviews ; they were later included in Bacovia 's lionized collection Plumb . 
 Himself a literary chronicler , Tudor Arghezi investigated the cultural phenomena of the day . One of his articles denounced Edmond Rostand as a kitsch author , suited to the tastes of " <unk> buyers . " He also reviewed Wilde 's comedy An Ideal Husband ( Issue 1 / 1914 ) and , unusually , ridiculed the Symbolist poetry of Mateiu Caragiale . Under Arghezi , Seara popularized international modern art , notably by publishing the Fauvist drawings of André <unk> . 
 Arghezi 's main focus was on satire , which he often directed at traditionalists and ethnic nationalists , particularly those arriving in from Transylvania . One such text attacked the poet laureate Octavian Goga , accusing him and other Transylvanian refugees of hoarding bureaucratic positions in the Kingdom of Romania . In a 1913 piece , Arghezi targeted scholar Ioan Bianu for allegedly mismanaging the Romanian Academy Library : " From his <unk> and his <unk> boots , Mr. Bianu has jumped straight into the aristocracy and [ ... ] turned our library [ ... ] into his own , Transylvanian , empire . [ ... ] An impertinent voice submits one to a detailed interrogation . It is Mr. Bianu , a jaundiced liver with a moustache , with the evil gaze of a man who collects many salaries but is aware of his own <unk> and dullness " . 
 As part of its emancipation agenda , Seara expressed sympathy for the Romanian Jews , and , in contrast to the antisemitism of more traditionalist reviews , accepted works sent in by Jewish writers . In October 1913 , Seara obtained and published a confidential order which gave Romanian Land Forces officers a free hand to discriminate against Jewish recruits . In September 1914 , it hosted the journalistic debut of Jewish avant @-@ garde author Jacques G. Costin , who was , with Vinea , caretaker of the cultural pages . Like Arghezi and Vinea , Costin experimented with satirical genres , his sketch story techniques borrowed from 19th century classic Ion Luca Caragiale ( Mateiu 's father ) . Some of the poems published in Seara were authored by Arghezi 's Jewish wife , Constanța <unk> . Seara was also receiving contributions from Grigore <unk> , the Armenian Romanian ethnographer and art historian .

 A final period in Seara 's history coincided with the start of World War I and Romania 's neutrality period . As public opinion divided itself between supporters of the Entente Powers and those who favored the Central Powers , Seara and Minerva stood for the latter group , the " Germanophiles " . The two papers reputedly entered this competition for the public eye with a handicap . An Ententist daily , Adevărul , claimed that , together , Seara and Minerva had consumed 481 tons of paper in printing from January 1 to August 31 , 1914 ( for itself and <unk> , it claimed a figure of 1 @,@ 284 tons ) . 
 Like other samples of Germanophile media , Seara is widely alleged to have been the recipient of special propaganda funds from the German Empire and Austria @-@ Hungary . According to historian Lucian Boia , Germanophile newspapers had little room for maneuver , given their unpopular agenda : " of little interest , boycotted and with their offices once in a while assaulted by the ' indignant ' public , [ they ] could never have supported themselves without an infusion of German money . " Similarly , researcher Carmen Patricia <unk> argues : " Seara would [ never ] have been the paper most useful to German propaganda . [ ... ] Minerva and Seara were read by just about no one . " Claims of German payments focus on Bogdan @-@ Pitești 's shady political dealings , the target of controversy since 1915 . Boia notes that the patron , who had no reason for refusing German bribes , may have been genuinely committed to the Germanophile cause , regardless of such additional benefits . Boia also claims that , keeping in with a Romanian tradition of the " <unk> " , the Francophile press may also have received funds from the Entente . Contrarily , historian Ion <unk> argues that " fraudulent wheeler @-@ dealer " Bogdan @-@ Pitești and his " money obsessed " patron were merely directing their support toward the highest bidder . According to various accounts , Bogdan @-@ Pitești was diverting much of his own political payments into increasing his prestigious art collection or supporting his retinue . 
 In contrast to other Germanophile mouthpieces , Seara stated its support for the Central Powers early on , before such financing could occur — even before its patron Cantacuzino decided which side he supported . In the months of strife which preceded the actual war , the Romanian daily published telegrams and concerned commentary about the effects of nationalism in Central Europe and the Balkans . These accused the Greek Kingdom and Northern Epirote militias of decimating the Aromanian community in Korçë during April 1914 , and urged Romanians to express their indignation . A month later , Seara was taking a stand against Romanian irredentism over Transylvania , as analyzed by the Transylvanian Germanophile Ioan Slavici . Slavici 's texts scandalized the nationalist press for supporting Vasile <unk> , the pro @-@ Hungarian priest and suspected agent of influence . However , the newspaper was also criticizing the Hungarian authorities for demanding the extradition of university student <unk> . The latter , Seara reported , was wrongly accused of a bomb attack on the Diocese of <unk> , when the act was more likely attributable to the revolutionist Ilie <unk> . 
 During June , Seara also circulated a rumor about secret talks between King Carol I and Nicholas II of the Russian Empire , in Constanța . Seara claimed that the two royals had agreed to oversee a shift of power , forcing a union between the Serbian and Montenegrin kingdoms against the Central Powers ' express wishes . Shortly after the Sarajevo Assassination , which <unk> the Central Powers a casus belli , Seara circulated rumors about the contradictions between Austrians and Hungarian subjects of the double monarchy . It alleged that , instead of mourning , the Hungarian colony of Ploiești had organized " a very merry celebration " at the consulate . 
 In the weeks and months following the assassination , Arghezi 's articles blamed the push toward war on Serbian nationalism and the Balkans question at large : " Until such time as when Europe shall incorporate and enslave the Balkans , they will endure as the nest where all of Europe 's assassinations are being organized " ; " the Serbs have staged an attempt on Austria [ <unk> ] ' s existence , in dastardly manner . " Arghezi had set his mind on continued neutrality , arguing that it could turn Romania into an arbiter and broker of peace . A similar position was held by Karnabatt . 
 In autumn 1914 , Seara and Minerva were both purchased by a German consortium , although Bogdan @-@ Pitești was probably still the former 's ( uncredited ) manager . The two papers were brought under a single umbrella , the publishing house <unk> . Its board of directors included Bogdan @-@ Pitești , publicist Josef B. <unk> , banker <unk> , and investor Josef <unk> . The acquisition , which reputedly followed an increase in German propaganda and espionage all over Romania , was described as scandalous by <unk> , an Ententist newspaper owned by Take Ionescu . In a September 24 piece called La <unk> ( " On Public Sale " ) , it claimed that Minerva cost the Germans 3 million lei , and Seara only 400 @,@ 000 lei . This allegation was confirmed during later inquiries . 
 One account has it that the Germans paid Bogdan @-@ Pitești the cost of paper and printing , which had been hitherto provided , for free , by Cantacuzino . Bogdan @-@ Pitești ( and German funds ) were probably involved in financing a new platform , Cronica , launched by Arghezi and Gala Galaction in February 1915 . In October of that year , with probable German support , Bogdan @-@ Pitești , Arghezi and Galaction set up another Germanophile newspaper , Libertatea ( " Freedom " ) , presided upon , for a short while , by N. Fleva . According to one account , Fleva had earlier been approached to take over as Seara manager by German envoys <unk> and Hilmar von dem Bussche @-@ <unk> , but , realizing the implications , had refused . 
 = = = Conservatives and socialists = = = 
 Cantacuzino ended his period of reflection in January 1915 , when he openly supported Alexandru Marghiloman in creating a pro @-@ German subgroup within the Conservative Party . <unk> their standing in the party , both men cited irregularities in the Conservative caucus . 
 With many of its articles , Seara popularized Marghiloman 's views on conservatism and geopolitics . Conservative in outlook , the <unk> and anti @-@ Slavic Karnabatt outlined his political vision in some detail , discussing the Entente 's imminent " bankruptcy " . Ilie Bărbulescu , a Slavist and Marghiloman Conservative who advocated pro @-@ German neutralism , also published articles in Seara during 1915 . Beyond this conservative core , Seara colored its pages in various shades of left @-@ wing <unk> , from socialism and social democracy to anarchism . According to literary historian Paul Cernat , the ideological ambiguity and conjectural alliances between socialists and conservatives was motivated by a common enemy , the pro @-@ Entente and " plutocratic " National Liberal Party . 
 The independent socialist Felix Aderca , later known as a novelist , expanded on his earlier theoretical articles for Noua Revistă Română , depicting the German Empire as the " progressive " actor in the war . Through the voice of another contributor , the old anarchist scholar Zamfir Arbore , Seara was focusing its criticism on Russia 's Tsarist autocracy , against whom Arbore had been fighting for decades . Similar ideals inspired Alexis Nour , who arrived to Seara from the home @-@ grown leftist current , Poporanism . Bogdan @-@ Pitești wrote with noted passion about his socialist allies , using the pseudonym Al . Dodan . On October 6 , 1914 , Dodan saluted the Social Democratic Party of Romania for organizing internationalist peace rallies , as " emerging from the mind and soul of the entire Romanian people " . According to legend , the Seara patron privately declared himself a Catholic anarchist , and was rather hostile to communism . 
 Avram <unk> @-@ Rodion , a socialist based in Iași , contributed a special series of articles documenting the growth of <unk> in that city , and throughout Moldavia region . Titled <unk> din Iași ( " Letters from Iași " ) , it notably chronicled the conflicts between the enthusiastically Ententist University of Bucharest professors and their more skeptical University of Iași colleagues . Seara also enlisted contributions from physician <unk> Călin , a member of the <unk> Executive Committee and author of its <unk> pacifist manifesto . Despite this agenda , <unk> was not employed as a political panelist , but , as a practicing physician , held Seara 's advice column . 
 = = = Bessarabia vs. Transylvania = = = 
 The national dilemma confronting Romanians during the neutrality period was not just a choice of sides , but also one of irredenta : while the National Liberal overtures toward the Entente were supposed to grant Romania Transylvania and some other Romanian @-@ inhabited regions of Austria @-@ Hungary , the Conservatives wished to recover Bessarabia , occupied by the Russian Empire — in 1916 , the two options seemed mutually exclusive . Seara and Minerva followed the principles of Marghiloman , who had reached the conclusion that the Entente did not in fact support the disestablishment of Austria @-@ Hungary , and who postulated that Russification in Bessarabia was more serious than Magyarization in Transylvania . Ilie Bărbulescu 's Seara articles , deemed " erudite and indigestible " by Boia , focused on the supposed indestructibility of Austria @-@ Hungary , and consoled Transylvanian Romanians with the option of greater devolution ( see United States of Greater Austria ) . Writer Ion Gorun , who hailed from an anti @-@ Hungarian community but was also a Habsburg loyalist , was a distinct presence at Seara . His articles favored the term " Austria " instead of " Austria @-@ Hungary " , and claimed that Romania could only find " triumph " as an Austrian ally . Gorun spoke of any alliance with Russia as dangerous and absurd ; the implication of such a move , he argued , caught Transylvanian Romanians in a pincer and also meant Romania 's subjugation to the Russian Empire . 
 The cause of Bessarabia was championed by Arbore , who at the time rejected all notion that the region could ever witness a Russian devolution , and expressed distress that Romanian intellectuals were more interested in the fate of France than in the freedoms of Bessarabian Romanians . Bogdan @-@ Pitești 's various articles also show his interest in the Bessarabian cause . Expressing regret that " most civilized " France stood by the world 's " most savage , most ignorant and bloodiest oligarchy " , " the Russia of pogroms and assassinations " , he deemed Romania 's overtures toward the Tsarist regime a " national crime " . Additionally , " Dodan " suggested that Austria @-@ Hungary was preferable as a friend , as Romania 's only guarantee against the " Slavic deluge " . Later , he argued that the cause of Transylvania was settled by , and within , Austria @-@ Hungary . He mapped out an alternative strategy : neutral until the end of the war , Romania would eventually march its troops into Bessarabia , with Austrian acquiescence . In October 1915 , Aderca added his voice to the Bessarabian chorus . He postulated that the Transylvanian cause was doomed , and , since the Germans were poised to win the war , constituted " a union of the losers " ; instead , he urged Romania to take Bessarabia as the spoils of war . Karnabatt 's own articles began by stating a minimalist objective in " the reincorporation of Bessarabia " . Later , he advocated the extension of Romanian territory eastward , into Transnistria and down to the Dnieper River ( as counterbalance to a foreseeable Greater Bulgaria ) . 
 An unusually vast and , according to Boia , naïve project was sketched by the Bessarabian @-@ born Nour , who claimed that , even if granted a military victory , Austria @-@ Hungary would still crumble into " developed nations " . Nour was confident that , with the return of peace , Romania would still have an option to annex its Austrian irredenta : Transylvania , Bukovina , the Banat , <unk> and Maramureș . He speculated that a late entry into the war could also bring Romania possession of Bessarabia , large swathes of the Ukraine , and Odessa harbor ; and even that , once victorious against the Entente , the Central Powers would award her an extra @-@ European colonial empire . 
 = = Disestablishment and legacy = = 
 On separate occasions in 1916 , Bogdan @-@ Pitești and Karnabatt toured the German Empire . Bogdan @-@ Pitești was the first to travel there , together with his concubine Domnica and his favorite Mateiu Caragiale . During his own journey , Karnabatt described Germany as unified by civic order and the determination to win , in several letters that were published by Seara in June 1916 . The newspaper 's wrong bet on a German victory on the Western Front was strained by Alexis Nour who , in April 1916 , wrote that a French capitulation would inevitably follow the Battle of Verdun . 
 Seara disappeared , together with Minerva , Libertatea , <unk> and most other Germanophile papers , in late summer 1916 , shortly after Romania declared war on the Central Powers . When the German and Austrian troops invaded southern Romania , forcing the Ententist government to flee for Iași , some of Seara 's former staff remained in Bucharest and chose the path of collaborationism . This was notably pursued by Arghezi , Galaction , Bărbulescu and Karnabatt , all of whom wrote for the propaganda tribune Gazeta <unk> . According to popular rumors , Bogdan @-@ Pitești fell out of favor with the occupiers , who eventually discovered that he had been squandering their grants . 
 In contrast , several former Seara contributors silenced their criticism of the Entente throughout the rest of the war . Nicolae Petrescu Găină made some contributions to the Entente 's propaganda effort during the second half of 1916 . He was captured by the Germans in Bucharest , allegedly after being turned over to them by Bogdan @-@ Pitești . Avram <unk> @-@ Rodion was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces as a medic , earning distinction , but returned to Germanophile journalism after Romania sealed the separate peace of 1918 ; the victim of clinical depression , he committed suicide in autumn . An Order of the Star of Romania for his work as a military physician , Călin died of typhus in early 1917 . Aderca too saw action on the front , and preserved his socialist @-@ inspired neutralism — it later surfaced in his various fiction writings . 
 After the November 1918 Armistice with Germany changed Romania 's fortunes , leading to the creation of Greater Romania , several former Seara journalists were prosecuted for treason . In March 1919 , a military tribunal sentenced Karnabatt to ten , Arghezi to five years imprisonment . They were however pardoned by King Ferdinand I , in winter 1920 . Bogdan @-@ Pitești had joined them in prison : according to some accounts , he was also held for collaborationism , while others record , in more detail , that he was serving an earlier sentence for fraud . A while after , some of Seara 's former contributors were retelling their encounters with Bogdan @-@ Pitești and his brand of journalism by the means of <unk> . The Seara affair is notably retold in novels by Lucrezzia Karnabatt ( <unk> , 1922 ) and Ion Vinea ( May Venom , 1971 ) . 
 Arghezi 's texts for Seara were largely unknown to later generations . They again saw print in 2003 , in a critical edition co @-@ edited by daughter <unk> Arghezi ( Domnica Theodorescu ) and Traian Radu . According to <unk> Gheorghe Pienescu , who collected and reedited the texts for printing in the 1960s , the copies were taken from him under false pretense by <unk> Arghezi , and never returned . As an additional contribution to Romanian literature , Seara 's popularization of the expression <unk> de Curtea @-@ Veche may have inspired Mateiu Caragiale in writing his celebrated 1929 novel .

 " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " is a hit song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her eighth studio album Fever ( 2001 ) . The song was released in Australia by Parlophone as the lead single from the album on 8 September 2001 . It was released on 17 September 2001 in the United Kingdom . In the United States , the single was released on 18 February 2002 . Written and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis , " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " is a midtempo dance @-@ pop song which lyrically details Minogue 's obsession towards her lover . The song is famous for its " la la la " hook . 
 In addition to positive reviews from music critics , " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " found commercial success on a large scale . It peaked at number one on the charts of Austria , Belgium , France , Germany , Italy , Poland , Switzerland , the United Kingdom , and every other European country excluding Finland . It also topped the charts of Minogue 's native country Australia , Canada and New Zealand . In the United States , the song peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart , becoming Minogue 's biggest hit in the region since " The Loco @-@ Motion " . " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " reportedly reached number one in 40 countries across the globe . It was certified triple @-@ platinum in Australia , double @-@ platinum in the United Kingdom , and gold in the United States . It became Minogue 's first single to sell in excess of one million copies in the United Kingdom , where it also stands as the 28th best @-@ selling single of the millennium . As of 2013 , the song is Minogue 's highest selling single and one of the best @-@ selling singles of all time , with worldwide sales exceeding seven million . 
 The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Dawn Shadforth , and features Minogue performing various dance routines in different futuristic backdrops . It became notable for the revealing hooded white jumpsuit Minogue wore during one of the scenes . The song has been performed by Minogue during all of her concert tours as of 2013 , with the exception of the Anti Tour . Following its release , " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " ranked on a number of decade @-@ end lists compiled by magazines such as the Rolling Stone , The Guardian , and NME . It is considered to be Minogue 's strongest commercial breakthrough in the United States and is said to have been the reason behind the success of its parent album Fever in the region . " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " is also recognised as Minogue 's signature song and was a defining point in her musical career . In 2012 , the song was re @-@ recorded for inclusion in Minogue 's orchestral compilation album The Abbey Road Sessions .

 In 2000 , Minogue signed on to Parlophone and released her seventh studio album Light Years . The disco and Europop inspired album was a critical and commercial success , and was later certified four times @-@ platinum in Minogue 's native country Australia for shipment of 280 @,@ 000 units , and platinum in the United Kingdom for shipment of 300 @,@ 000 units . " Spinning Around " was released as the lead single off the album and was a commercial success , attaining a platinum certification in Australia for shipment of 70 @,@ 000 units , and a silver certification in the United Kingdom for shipment of 200 @,@ 000 units . She promoted the album by embarking on the On a Night Like This tour . Minogue premièred " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " by performing it during the tour and soon after discussion regarding the song " quickly set online <unk> alight " . " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " was chosen as the lead single from Minogue 's eighth studio album Fever , and it was released on 8 September 2001 by Parlophone in Australia , while in the United Kingdom and other European countries it was released on 17 September . 
 " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " was written and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis , who had been put together by British artist manager Simon Fuller , who wanted the duo to come up with a song for British pop group S Club 7 . The song was recorded using Cubase music software , which Davis ran on his Mac computer . Davis began playing an acoustic guitar and ran a 125 beats per minute drum loop , on which Dennis began singing the line " I just can 't get you out of my head " in the key of D minor . After three and a half hours , the demo was recorded and the vocals were laid afterwards . Dennis called their recording setup for the song " the most primitive set @-@ up you could imagine ! Different producers work in different ways . But it 's good to be reminded you don ’ t have to be reliant on equipment . A song is about melody and lyrics and being able to take something away in your memory that is going to haunt you " . She also regarded their production as a " very natural and fluid process " , saying " We know how hard we work sometimes to write songs and then spend months picking them to pieces , but this was the easiest process , the chemicals were all happy and working together " . 
 After Fuller heard the demo , he felt it wasn 't right for S Club 7 and rejected it ; English singer @-@ songwriter Sophie Ellis @-@ Bextor also turned down the offer to record it . Davis then met with Minogue 's A & R executive Jamie Nelson who , after hearing the demo cassette of the song , booked it for Minogue to record later that year . Nelson was impressed by the " vibe " of the song and felt it would please the " <unk> " . Although Davis was initially under the impression that the recording deal would be called off later , Minogue became enthusiastic to record the song after hearing 20 seconds of the demo . The whole song including Minogue 's vocals were recorded at Davis 's home studio in Surrey . The music , excluding the guitar part , was programmed using Korg Triton workstation via a MIDI . Dennis later remarked that " Even though Kylie wasn 't the first artist to be offered the song . I don 't believe it was meant to go to anyone other than Kylie , and I don 't believe anyone else would have done the incredible job she did with it , with the video , looking super @-@ hot ! " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " is a " robotic " midtempo dance @-@ pop song , with a tempo of 126 beats per minute . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing , the song is written in the key of C major , with Minogue 's vocal range spanning from C4 to D5 . Minogue chants a " la la la " hook in the song , which is often heralded as its most appealing part . BBC Radio 2 noted that the composition of the song is " deceptively simple , but its veins run with the whole history of electronic music " . They described the song 's bassline as " pulsing , " and recognised influences of English rock band New Order and German electronic music band Kraftwerk . The song does not follow the common verse @-@ chorus structure and is instead composed of numerous " misplaced sections . " Dennis reasoned that these sections " somehow work together " as she and Davis " didn 't try to force any structure after the event . The seeds were watered and they very quickly sprouted into something bigger than any of us " . Likewise , Davis commented that " It breaks a few rules as it starts with a chorus and in comes the ' la 's ' – that is what confused my publisher [ Fuller ] when he first heard it " . 
 Through the lyrics of the song , Minogue expresses her obsession with an anonymous figure . Dorian Lynskey from The Guardian termed the song a " mystery " as Minogue never reveals the identity of her object of infatuation . The critic suggested that the person Minogue is referring to is either " a partner , an evasive one @-@ night stand or someone who doesn 't know she exists " . Writing for the same newspaper , Everett True identified a " darker element " in the simple lyrics and felt this sentiment was echoed in Minogue 's restrained vocals . Further , True emphasised that while Minogue 's 1987 single " I Should Be So Lucky " presented an optimistic romantic future , " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " focuses on an " unhealthy " and potentially destructive obsession . He also noted that in the former song , Minogue played " the wide @-@ eyed ingénue with alacrity , " but in the latter song she is aware of the harmful nature of her infatuation , calling it a " desire that is wholly dependent on her own self @-@ control . " 
 In late 2012 , " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " was re @-@ recorded by Minogue for inclusion in her orchestral compilation album The Abbey Road Sessions . On the album , Minogue reworked 16 of her past songs with an orchestra , which , according to Nick Levine from BBC Music , " re @-@ imagine them without the disco glitz and vocal effects " . The Abbey Road Sessions @-@ version of " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " features a " more dramatic , fully fleshed out " musical arrangement , and follows a pizzicato playing technique , in which the strings of a string instrument are continuously plucked .

 The song was positively received by music critics . Chris True from AllMusic picked the song as a highlight of Fever , commenting that it " pulses and grooves like no other she 's [ Minogue 's ] recorded " . Jason Thompson from PopMatters described Minogue 's vocals as a " sexual come on " and called the song " trim and funky , certainly something that couldn 't miss anywhere " . Dominique Leone from Pitchfork Media praised the commercial prospect of the song , saying that it " exudes a catchiness that belies its inherent simplicity , so reassuring during an era when chart acts sound increasingly baroque and producers race to see who can ape electronic music trends first " . Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly said that the song " fully lives up to its title " with " every sound a hook " , and compared it to the works of Andrea True . Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH labelled the song " one of 2001 's best singles " , saying that it " predictably beat off lesser ' competition ' " . In 2012 , The Guardian critic Everett True defined " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " as " one of those rare moments in pop : sleek and chic and stylish and damnably danceable , but with a darker element hidden in plain sight . " 
 The Abbey Road Sessions – version of the song received generally positive reviews . Tim Sendra from AllMusic felt that " most interesting reboot " in the album took place on ' Can 't Get You Out of My Head ' , saying that the " insistent strings push the song along with a tightly coiled electricity that is impossible to resist " . He also picked the song as a highlight on the album . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine chose the song as one of the " standouts " on the album , saying that its arrangement " compensate for the lack of synthetic dance beats and vocal effects " . Tania <unk> from ARIA Charts described the track as a " powerful violin ballad with the accompaniment of a large orchestra throughout the remainder " . Simon Price from The Independent said that while the original version of " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " would be " impossible to improve on " , the reworked version " turns it into a pizzicato thriller score " . Jude Rogers from The Quietus , however , felt that the song does not " respond well to this [ orchestral ] treatment " .

 The accompanying music video for " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " was directed by Dawn Shadforth , and featured dance routines choreographed by Michael Rooney . Early in Minogue 's career , her youthful look , slim figure , and her " proportionally " large mouth attracted comments from various critics , with British red top newspaper News of the World speculating that the singer could possibly be an alien . Later while discussing the video , Shadforth and music critic Paul Morley took this " bizarre suggestion " into consideration to comment on Minogue as a " creative , experimental artist . " Shadforth blocked some shots of the initial driving scene based upon similar shots of Shirley Manson piloting an airplane in her award @-@ winning dogfight clip for Garbage 's " Special " . 
 The video was released on 11 August 2001 . It begins with Minogue driving a De Tomaso Mangusta sports car on a futuristic bridge , while singing the " la la la " hook of the song . The next scene consists of a number of dance couples performing a dance routine dressed in black and white costumes ; they are soon joined by Minogue , who is seen wearing a white tracksuit . The setting changes to a room where Minogue is seen striking various poses sporting bright crimson lipstick and a hooded white jumpsuit with a neckline plunging down to her navel . The outfit was designed by London @-@ based fashion designer Fee Doran , under the label of Mrs Jones . Minogue then performs a synchronised dance routine with several backup dancers , who are wearing red and black suits . As the video ends , she performs a similar routine on the top of a building during the night , this time wearing a lavender halter neck dress with ribbon tile trim . Various scenes in the video show Minogue 's face " unusually " close to the lens of the camera , thus it " subtly distorts , yet remains glamorous . " Shadforth felt the shot gave a " sort of sense of intimacy and as you say a sort of strangeness , " again drawing upon the suggestion of Minogue being an alien . Similarly , Morley opined that it was " the side of Kylie that suddenly reveals itself as being experimental , she is prepared to push herself into positions and shapes that might not be conventionally attractive [ ... ] She becomes alien Kylie as well . "

 At the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony , the music video was nominated for Best Dance Video , while Michael Rooney won the award for Best Choreography . The hooded white jumpsuit Minogue wore in the music video is often considered to be one of her most iconic looks , particularly due to its deep plunging neckline . British fashion designer and Minogue 's stylist William Baker described the choice of the <unk> , saying it was " it was pure but kind of slutty at the same time " . The outfit was put on display at Kylie : The Exhibition , an exhibition that featured " costumes and memorabilia collected over Kylie 's career " , held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London , England , and at Kylie : an exhibition , a similar exhibition held at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney , Australia . It was also included in Minogue 's official fashion photography book Kylie / Fashion , which was released on 19 November 2012 by Thames and Hudson to celebrate Minogue 's completion of 25 years in music . 
 The music video served as an inspiration for Morley while writing his book Words and Music : the history of pop in the shape of a city . In the book , Morley " turned the lonely drive she [ Minogue ] made in the song 's video towards a city [ ... ] into a fictional history of music , " referring to the opening sequence of the music video . The critic takes a ride with Minogue through a city and encounters various musicians and artists like the ghost of Elvis Presley , and Madonna , Kraftwerk , and [ Ludwig ] Wittgenstein . Academics Diane Railton and Paul Weston , in their 2005 essay Naughty Girls and Red Blooded Women ( Representations of Female <unk> in Music Video ) , contrasted the music video of " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " with that of American singer Beyoncé 's 2003 single " Baby Boy " . Railton and Weston concluded that while both videos focus on two singers performing seductive dance routines , Minogue is presented in a calculated manner and " is always provisional , restricted , and contingent " , whereas Beyoncé displays a particular " primitive , feral , uncontrolled and uncontrollable " sexuality embodied by the black female body . The two felt that the videos were representative of the raced depictions of white and black women in colonial times and pop culture , respectively .

In 2012 , The Guardian included the song in their list of " The Best Number One Records " , labelling it to be " sleek , Arctic @-@ blue minimalism , like an emotionally thwarted retelling of Donna Summer 's " I Feel Love " . In the same year , PRS for Music , a UK copyright collection society and performance rights organisation which collects royalties on behalf of songwriters and composers , named " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " the " Most Popular Song of the Decade " as it received the highest airplay and live covers in the 2000s ( decade ) . 
 In 2013 , a survey of 700 people was conducted as part of the Manchester Science Festival to find out which song they considered the " catchiest " , and " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " topped the poll . Lee Barron , in his essay The Seven Ages of Kylie Minogue : Postmodernism , Identity , and <unk> Mimicry , noted that the song " further established Minogue 's cultural and commercial relevance in the new millennium " . He remarked that the song " with its hypnotic " la la la " refrain and the deceptively uncomplicated , catchily repetitive beats and synth @-@ sound , marked yet another clearly defined image transformation from the camp @-@ infused Light Years to an emphasis upon a cool , machine @-@ like sexuality , a trait clearly identifiable within the promotional video for " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " . Similarly , Everett True from The Guardian wrote that the song continued the " change in the marketing and public perception of Kylie " and her transition from the " homely girl @-@ next @-@ door " to " a much more flirtatious , sophisticated persona " that started with the release of " Spinning Around " in 2000 . True also felt that the success of " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " was one of the motivating factors behind " manufactured " pop music gaining a " new postmodern respectability " and marked a " clear shift in attitude towards pop music among the ' serious ' rock critic fraternity : the idea that ( manufactured , female ) pop music might well be the equal of ( organic , male ) rock music after all , that each has their high points and their low . " In 2011 , Minogue 's official website posted a special article marking the song 's 10th anniversary on 8 September , the release date of " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " in Australia .

 = Slender Man = 
 The Slender Man ( also known as <unk> ) is a fictional supernatural character that originated as an Internet meme created by Something Awful forums user Eric Knudsen ( a.k.a. " Victor Surge " ) in 2009 . It is depicted as resembling a thin , unnaturally tall man with a blank and usually featureless face , wearing a black suit . 
 Stories of the Slender Man commonly feature him stalking , abducting or traumatizing people , particularly children . The Slender Man is not confined to a single narrative , but appears in many disparate works of fiction , mostly composed online . Fiction relating to the Slender Man encompasses many media , including literature , art and video series such as Marble Hornets . Outside of online fiction , the Slender Man has had impact on popular culture , having been referenced in the video game Minecraft and generated video games of his own , such as Slender : The Eight Pages and Slender : The Arrival . 
 Beginning in 2014 , a minor moral panic occurred over the Slender Man after readers of his fiction were connected to several violent acts , particularly a near @-@ fatal stabbing in Waukesha , Wisconsin . 
 = = Origin = = 
 The Slender Man was created on June 10 , 2009 on a thread in the Something Awful Internet forum . The thread was a <unk> contest in which users were challenged to edit everyday photographs to appear paranormal . A forum poster with the user name " Victor Surge " contributed two black and white images of groups of children , to which he added a tall , thin spectral figure wearing a black suit . Although previous entries had consisted solely of photographs , Surge supplemented his submission with snatches of text — supposedly from witnesses — describing the abductions of the groups of children , and giving the character the name " The Slender Man " : 
 The quote under the first photograph read : 
 We didn 't want to go , we didn 't want to kill them , but its persistent silence and outstretched arms horrified and comforted us at the same time … 
 The quote under the second photograph read : 
 One of two recovered photographs from the Stirling City Library blaze . Notable for being taken the day which fourteen children vanished and for what is referred to as “ The Slender Man ” . <unk> cited as film defects by officials . Fire at library occurred one week later . Actual photograph confiscated as evidence . 
 These additions effectively transformed the photographs into a work of fiction . Subsequent posters expanded upon the character , adding their own visual or textual contributions . 
 Victor Surge ( real name Eric Knudsen ) claimed that he was inspired to create the Slender Man by legends of the shadow people , the writings of H. P. Lovecraft , Zack Parsons , and Stephen King ( particularly The Mist ) , and the surrealism of William S. Burroughs . His intention was , he claimed , " to formulate something whose motivations can barely be comprehended , and [ which caused ] unease and terror in a general population . " In an interview with the Slender Nation podcast , Knudsen cited the Tall Man from the film series Phantasm as an inspiration for the Slender Man . 
 Other pre @-@ existing fictional or legendary creatures often thought to have inspired the Slender Man include : the Gentlemen , black @-@ suited , pale , bald demons from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode " Hush " ; Men in black , many accounts of which grant them an uncanny appearance with an unnatural walk and " oriental " features ; and The Question , a DC Comics superhero with a blank face , whose secret identity is " Victor Sage " , a name similar to Knudsen 's alias " Victor Surge " . 
 In her book , Folklore , Horror Stories , and the Slender Man : The Development of an Internet Mythology , Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia connected the Slender Man to ancient folklore about fairies . Like fairies , Slender Man is otherworldly , with motives that are often difficult to grasp ; like fairies , his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what the viewer wants or fears to see , and , like fairies , the Slender Man calls the woods and wild places his home and kidnaps children . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 The Slender Man soon went viral , spawning numerous works of fanart , cosplay , and online fiction known as " <unk> " : scary stories told in short snatches of easily <unk> text that spread from site to site . Divorced from its original creator , the Slender Man became the subject of myriad stories by multiple authors within an overarching mythos . 
 Many aspects of the Slender Man mythos first appeared on the original Something Awful thread . One of the earliest additions was added by a forum user named " Thoreau Up " , who created a folklore story set in 16th @-@ century Germany involving a character called Der Grossman , which was implied to be an early reference to the Slender Man . The first video series involving the Slender Man evolved from a post on the Something Awful thread by user " ce gars " . It tells of a fictional film school friend named Alex <unk> , who had stumbled upon something troubling while shooting his first feature @-@ length project , Marble Hornets . The video series , published in found footage style on YouTube , forms an alternate reality game describing the <unk> ' fictional experiences with the Slender Man . The ARG also incorporates a Twitter feed and an alternate YouTube channel created by a user named " <unk> " . As of 2013 , Marble Hornets now has over 250 @,@ 000 subscribers around the world , and 55 million views . Other Slender Man @-@ themed YouTube serials followed , including <unk> and <unk> . 
 In 2012 , the Slender Man was adapted into a video game titled Slender : The Eight Pages ; within its first month of release , the game was downloaded over 2 million times . Several popular variants of the game followed , including <unk> 's Shadow and Slender Man for iOS , which became the second most @-@ popular app download . The sequel to Slender : The Eight Pages , Slender : The Arrival , was released in 2013 . Several independent films about the Slender Man have been released or are in development , including Entity and The Slender Man , released free online after a $ 10 @,@ 000 Kickstarter campaign . In 2013 , it was announced that Marble Hornets would become a feature film . In 2015 , the film adaptation , Always Watching : A Marble Hornets Story , was released on VOD . In 2016 , Sony Pictures subsidiary Screen Gems partnered with Mythology Entertainment to bring a Slender Man film into theatres . 
 = = Description = = 
 Because the Slender Man 's fictional " mythology " has evolved without an official " canon " for reference , his appearance , motives , habits , and abilities are not fixed , but change depending on the storyteller . He is most commonly described as very tall and thin with unnaturally long , tentacle @-@ like arms ( or merely tentacles ) , which he can extend to intimidate or capture prey . In most stories his face is white and featureless , but occasionally his face appears differently to anyone who sees it . He appears to be wearing a dark suit and tie . The Slender Man is often associated with the forest and / or abandoned locations and has the ability to teleport . Proximity to the Slender Man is often said to trigger a " Slender sickness " ; a rapid onset of paranoia , nightmares and delusions accompanied by nosebleeds . 
 Early stories featured him targeting children or young adults . Some featured young adults driven insane or to act on his behalf , while others did not , and others claim that investigating the Slender Man will draw his attention . The web series Marble Hornets established the idea of proxies ( humans who fall under the Slender Man 's influence ) though initially they were simply violently insane , rather than puppets of the Slender Man . Marble Hornets also introduced the idea that the Slender Man could interfere with video and audio recordings , as well as the " Slender Man symbol " , which became a common trope of Slender fiction . Graphic violence and body horror are uncommon in the Slender Man mythos , with many narratives choosing to leave the fate of his victims obscure . Shira Chess notes that " It is important to note that few of the retellings identify exactly what kind of monster the Slender Man might be , and what his specific intentions <unk> these points all remain mysteriously and usefully vague . " 
 = = = As folklore = = = 
 Several scholars have argued that , despite being a fictional work with an identifiable origin point , the Slender Man represents a form of digital folklore . Shira Chess argues that the Slender Man exemplifies the similarities between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet , and that , unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves , the fact that the Slender Man 's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form . Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore : collectivity ( meaning that it is created by a collective , rather than a single individual ) , variability ( meaning that the story changes depending on the teller ) , and performance ( meaning that the storyteller 's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his / her audience ) . 
 Andrew Peck also considers the Slender Man to be an authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance . Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face @-@ to @-@ face performance in several notable ways , such as by occurring asynchronously , encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication , combining elements of oral , written , and visual communication , and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity despite the lack of a physically present group . He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication . 
 Jeff Tolbert also accepts the Slender Man as folkloric and suggests it represents a process he calls “ reverse <unk> . ” <unk> in folkloristics is the process of acting out a folk narrative . According to Tolbert , the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore @-@ like narratives where none existed before . It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre . According to Tolbert , this represents two processes in one : it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience , and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “ traditional ” narratives , modeled on existing folklore ( but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition ) . 
 Professor Thomas Pettitt of the University of Southern Denmark has described the Slender Man as being an exemplar of the modern age 's closing of the " Gutenberg Parenthesis " ; the time period from the invention of the printing press to the spread of the web in which stories and information were codified in discrete media , to a return to the older , more primal forms of storytelling , exemplified by oral tradition and campfire tales , in which the same story can be retold , reinterpreted and recast by different tellers , expanding and evolving with time . 
 = = Reasons for success = = 
 Media scholar and folklorist Andrew Peck attributes the success of the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature . Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery , users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories . This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man . Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical , this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community . In these respects , the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends , and the character 's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression . 
 Although nearly all users understand that the Slender Man is not real , they suspend that disbelief in order to become more engrossed when telling or listening to stories . This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man legend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality , keeping the creature as an object of legend dialectic . This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the character 's origin and purpose . Only five months after his creation , George <unk> 's Coast to Coast AM , a radio call @-@ in show devoted to the paranormal and conspiracy theories , began receiving callers asking about the Slender Man . Two years later , an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune described his origins as " difficult to pinpoint . " Eric Knudsen has commented that many people , despite understanding that the Slender Man was created on the Something Awful forums , still entertain the possibility that he might be real . 
 Shira Chess describes the Slender Man as a metaphor for " helplessness , power differentials , and anonymous forces . " Peck sees parallels between the Slender Man and common anxieties about the digital age , such as feelings of constant connectedness and unknown third @-@ party observation . Similarly , Tye Van Horn , a writer for The Elm , has suggested that the Slender Man represents modern fear of the unknown ; in an age flooded with information , people have become so inured to ignorance that they now fear what they cannot understand . Troy Wagner , the creator of Marble Hornets , ascribes the terror of the Slender Man to its malleability ; people can shape it into whatever frightens them most . Tina Marie Boyer noted that " The Slender man is a prohibitive monster , but the cultural boundaries he guards are not clear . Victims do not know when they have violated or crossed them . " 
 = = Copyright = = 
 Despite his folkloric qualities , the Slender Man is not in the public domain . Several for @-@ profit ventures involving the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character , while others were civilly blocked from distribution ( including the Kickstarter @-@ funded film ) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources . Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man @-@ related projects , the issue is complicated by the fact that , while he is the character 's creator , a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media , including film and television . The identity of this option holder has not been made public . Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright has less to do with money than with artistic integrity : " I just want something amazing to come off it ... something that 's scary and disturbing and kinda different . I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional . " As of May , 2016 , the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment .

 On May 31 , 2014 , two 12 @-@ year @-@ old girls in Waukesha , Wisconsin allegedly held down and stabbed a 12 @-@ year @-@ old classmate 19 times . When questioned later by authorities , they reportedly claimed that they wished to commit a murder as a first step to becoming proxies for the Slender Man , having read about it online . They also state that they were afraid that Slender Man would kill their families if they did not commit the murder . The victim was able to crawl from the woods , where she had been left , to reach a roadside . A passing cyclist intervened , and the victim survived the attack . The purported attackers were charged as adults and are each facing up to 65 years in prison . One of the girls reportedly said Slender Man watches her , can read minds , and could teleport . Experts testified in court she also said she conversed with Lord Voldemort and one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . On August 1 , 2014 , she was found incompetent to stand trial and her prosecution was suspended until her condition improved . On November 12 , 2014 , a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial . On December 19 , 2014 , the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial . In August 2015 , the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults . 
 In a statement to the media , Eric Knudsen said , " I am deeply saddened by the tragedy in Wisconsin and my heart goes out to the families of those affected by this terrible act . " He stated he would not be giving interviews on the matter . 
 After hearing the story , an unidentified woman from Cincinnati , Ohio told a <unk> TV reporter her 13 @-@ year @-@ old daughter had attacked her with a knife , and had written macabre fiction , some involving the Slender Man , who the mother said motivated the attack . 
 On September 4 , 2014 , a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl in Port Richey , Florida , allegedly set her family 's house on fire while her mother and nine @-@ year @-@ old brother were inside . Police reported that the teenager had been reading online stories about Slender Man as well as Atsushi Ōkubo 's manga Soul Eater . Eddie Daniels of the Pasco Sheriff 's Office said the girl " had visited the website that contains a lot of the Slender Man information and stories [ ... ] It would be safe to say there is a connection to that . " 
 During an early 2015 epidemic of suicide attempts by young people ages 12 to 24 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation , Slender Man was cited as an influence ; the Oglala Sioux tribe president noted that many Native Americans traditionally believe in a " suicide spirit " similar to the Slender Man .

 Pat Nason of United Press International ( UPI ) wrote that marketing of the book " may have been somewhat complicated by the cover art " , which shows an actor in a gorilla costume with his middle finger raised . Wilson had originally wanted the gorilla picture to appear on the back cover of the book ; however , Warner Books stated it must appear on the book 's front cover . " It might stand as an apt emblem of the Razzies themselves , " commented Nason . " We are not PC . We do not pull punches . We do not pay attention to the basic rules of decorum . Hopefully the humor with which it is packaged takes a little of the sting out of it " , said Wilson to UPI . Christopher Borrelli of The Toledo Blade described the book as " a merchandising tie @-@ in " to the Golden Raspberry Awards . Wilson announced the nominees for the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards at a book signing for The Official Razzie Movie Guide at Brentano 's in Century City , Los Angeles , California .

 The Official Razzie Movie Guide received generally positive reviews from critics . 
 Barry X. Miller reviewed the book for Library Journal , and wrote " Wilson 's text is a surfeit of saccharine <unk> and gooey Ju Ju Bees , empty calories but fun to eat . " Miller compared to the book to Golden Turkey Awards and The Fifty Worst Films of All Time . Miller commented that Wilson provides " a wonderfully droll review " for each film entry in the book . Ben Steelman of the Wilmington Star @-@ News called the book a " handy volume " , and commented " in loving detail , Mr. Wilson describes his 100 favorites among the Worst Movies Ever Made " , David Germain of the Associated Press wrote that Wilson discusses " his take on the 100 most awful — yet perversely fun — movies to watch " . Jenny Marder of the Long Beach Press @-@ Telegram noted " Wilson , creator of the Golden Raspberry Awards , or Razzies , has become the authority for all movies so dreadful , they 're laughable , so excruciating , they 're , well , award @-@ winning .

 Catherine Shoard of The Evening Standard took a less enthusiastic approach to the book , however , describing it as " a companion book to the annual Golden Raspberry awards " , and saying that " it 's a shame elderly duds get more space than recent winners , and Wilson 's style , though amusing , is never really more than descriptive . Still , that 's all some films require ... " 
 = Zachary Taylor = 
 Zachary Taylor ( November 24 , 1784 – July 9 , 1850 ) was the 12th President of the United States , serving from March 1849 until his death in July 1850 . Before his presidency , Taylor was a career officer in the United States Army , rising to the rank of major general . 
 Taylor 's status as a national hero as a result of his victories in the Mexican @-@ American War won him election to the White House despite his vague political beliefs . His top priority as president was preserving the Union , but he died seventeen months into his term , before making any progress on the status of slavery , which had been inflaming tensions in Congress . 
 Taylor was born into a prominent family of planters who migrated westward from Virginia to Kentucky in his youth . 
 Taylor was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army in 1808 and made a name for himself as a captain in the War of 1812 . He climbed the ranks establishing military forts along the Mississippi River and entered the Black Hawk War as a colonel in 1832 . His success in the Second Seminole War attracted national attention and earned him the nickname " Old Rough and Ready " . 
 In 1845 , as the annexation of Texas was underway , President James K. Polk dispatched Taylor to the Rio Grande area in anticipation of a potential battle with Mexico over the disputed Texas – Mexico border . The Mexican – American War broke out in April 1846 . In May , Taylor defeated Mexican troops commanded by General Mariano Arista at the Battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma , and managed to drive his troops out of Texas . Taylor subsequently led his troops into Mexico , where they once again defeated Mexican troops commanded by Pedro de Ampudia at the Battle of Monterrey in September . Taylor subsequently defied orders by moving his troops further south , where , despite being severely outnumbered , he dealt a crushing blow to Mexican forces under Antonio López de Santa Anna in February 1847 at the Battle of Buena Vista . After this , most of Taylor 's troops were transferred to the command of Major General Winfield Scott , but Taylor 's popularity remained significant . 
 The Whig Party convinced the reluctant Taylor to lead their ticket , despite his unclear platform and lack of interest in politics . He won the election alongside New York politician Millard Fillmore , defeating Democratic candidates Lewis Cass and William Orlando Butler , as well as a third party effort led by former President Martin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams , Sr. of the Free Soil Party . As president , Taylor kept his distance from Congress and his cabinet , even as partisan tensions threatened to divide the Union . Debate over the slave status of the large territories claimed in the war led to threats of secession from Southerners . 
 Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself , Taylor did not push for the expansion of slavery . To avoid the question , he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood , setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850 . Taylor died suddenly of a stomach @-@ related illness in July 1850 , so had little impact on the sectional divide that led to civil war a decade later . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Zachary Taylor was born on November 24 , 1784 , on a plantation in Orange County , Virginia , to a prominent family of planters of English ancestry . He is inconclusively believed to have been born at the home of his maternal grandfather , Hare Forest Farm . He was the third of five surviving sons in his family ( a sixth died in infancy ) and had three younger sisters . His mother was Sarah Dabney ( Strother ) Taylor . His father , Richard Taylor , had served as a lieutenant colonel in the American Revolution . 
 Taylor was a descendant of Elder William Brewster , the Pilgrim colonist leader of the Plymouth Colony , a Mayflower immigrant , and one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact ; and Isaac Allerton Jr . , a colonial merchant and colonel who was the son of Mayflower Pilgrim Isaac Allerton and Fear Brewster . Taylor 's second cousin through that line was James Madison , the fourth president . 
 Leaving exhausted lands , his family joined the westward migration out of Virginia and settled near what developed as Louisville , Kentucky , on the Ohio River . Taylor grew up in a small woodland cabin before his family moved to a brick house with increased prosperity . The rapid growth of Louisville was a boon for Taylor 's father , who came to own 10 @,@ 000 acres ( 40 km2 ) throughout Kentucky by the start of the 19th century ; he held 26 slaves to cultivate the most developed portion of his holdings . There were no formal schools on the Kentucky frontier , and Taylor had a sporadic formal education . A schoolmaster recalled Taylor as a quick learner . His early letters show a weak grasp of spelling and grammar , and his handwriting was later described as " that of a near illiterate " . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 In June 1810 , Taylor married Margaret Mackall Smith , whom he had met the previous autumn in Louisville . " Peggy " Smith came from a prominent family of Maryland planters ; she was the daughter of Major Walter Smith , who had served in the Revolutionary War . The couple had six children : 
 Ann Mackall Taylor ( 1811 – 1875 ) , married Robert C. Wood , a U.S. Army surgeon she had met while living Fort Snelling , in 1829 . 
 Sarah Knox " <unk> " Taylor ( 1814 – 1835 ) , married Jefferson Davis in 1835 , whom she had met through her father at the end of the Black Hawk War ; she died at 21 of malaria in St. Francisville , Louisiana , shortly after her marriage . 
 Octavia Pannell Taylor ( 1816 – 1820 ) , died in early childhood . 
 Margaret Smith Taylor ( 1819 – 1820 ) , died in infancy along with Octavia when the Taylor family was stricken with a " bilious fever . " 
 Mary Elizabeth " Betty " Taylor ( 1824 – 1909 ) , married William Wallace Smith Bliss in 1848 ( he died 1853 ) , married Philip Pendleton Dandridge in 1858 . 
 Richard Scott " Dick " Taylor ( 1826 – 1879 ) , Confederate Army general , married Louise Marie <unk> <unk> in 1851 .

 On May 3 , 1808 , Taylor joined the U.S. Army , receiving a commission as a first lieutenant of the Seventh Infantry Regiment . He was among the new officers commissioned by Congress in response to the Chesapeake – Leopard Affair , in which an American frigate had been boarded by the crew of a British warship , sparking calls for war . Taylor spent much of 1809 in the dilapidated camps of New Orleans and nearby Terre aux Boeufs . He was promoted to captain in November 1810 . His army duties were limited at this time , and he attended to his personal finances . Over the next several years , he began to purchase slaves and a good deal of bank stock in Louisville . He bought a plantation in Louisville for $ 95 @,@ 000 that had 83 slaves attached to it , as well as the Cypress Grove Plantation near Rodney , Jefferson County , Mississippi , bringing the total number of slaves under him above 200 . In July 1811 he was called to the Indiana Territory , where he assumed control of Fort Knox after the commandant fled . In only a few weeks , he was able to restore order in the garrison , for which he was lauded by Governor William Henry Harrison . 
 = = = War of 1812 = = = 
 During the War of 1812 , in which U.S. forces battled the British Empire and its Indian allies , Taylor successfully defended Fort Harrison in Indiana Territory from an Indian attack commanded by the Shawnee chief Tecumseh . Taylor gained recognition and received a brevet ( temporary ) promotion to the rank of major . Later that year he joined General Samuel Hopkins as an aide on two expeditions : the first into the Illinois Territory and the second to the Tippecanoe battle site , where they were forced to retreat in the Battle of Wild Cat Creek . Taylor moved his growing family to Fort Knox after the violence subsided . In spring 1814 , he was called back into action under Brigadier General Benjamin Howard . That October he supervised the construction of Fort Johnson near present @-@ day Warsaw , Illinois , the last toehold of the U.S. Army in the upper Mississippi River Valley . Upon Howard 's death a few weeks later , Taylor was ordered to abandon the fort and retreat to Saint Louis . Reduced to the rank of captain when the war ended in 1815 , he resigned from the army . He re @-@ entered it a year later after gaining a commission as a major . 
 = = = Commanded Fort Howard = = = 
 For two years , Taylor commanded Fort Howard at the Green Bay , Michigan Territory , settlement . He then returned to Louisville and his family . In April 1819 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and dined with President James Monroe . In late 1821 , Taylor took the 7th Infantry to Natchitoches , Louisiana , on the Red River . On the orders of General Edmund P. Gaines , they set out to locate a new post more convenient to the Sabine River frontier . By the following March , Taylor had established Fort Jesup , at the Shield 's Spring site southwest of Natchitoches . That November he was transferred to Fort Robertson at Baton Rouge , where he remained until February 1824 . He spent the next few years on recruiting duty . In late 1826 he was called to Washington , D.C. , to work on an Army committee to consolidate and improve military organization . In the meantime he acquired his first Louisiana plantation and decided to move with his family to Baton Rouge as their home . 
 = = = Black Hawk War = = = 
 In May 1828 , Taylor was called back to action , commanding Fort Snelling in Michigan Territory ( now Minnesota ) on the northern Mississippi River for a year , and nearby Fort Crawford for a year . After some time on furlough , when he expanded his landholdings , Taylor was promoted to colonel of the 1st Infantry Regiment in April 1832 . At that time , the Black Hawk War was beginning in the West . Taylor campaigned under General Henry Atkinson to pursue and later defend against Chief Black Hawk 's forces throughout the summer . The end of the war in August 1832 signaled the end of Indian resistance to U.S. expansion in the area , and the following years were relatively quiet . During this period Taylor resisted the courtship of his 17 @-@ year @-@ old daughter Sarah Knox Taylor and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis , the future President of the Confederate States of America . He respected Davis but did not approve of his daughter becoming a military wife , as he knew it was a hard life for families . Davis and Sarah Taylor married in June 1835 , but she died three months later of malaria contracted on a summer visit to Davis ' sister in St. Francisville , Louisiana . 
 = = = Second Seminole War = = = 
 By 1837 , the Second Seminole War was underway when Taylor was directed to Florida . He defeated the Seminole Indians in the Christmas Day Battle of Lake Okeechobee , which was among the largest U.S. – Indian battles of the nineteenth century . He was promoted to brigadier general in recognition of his success . In May 1838 , Brig. Gen. Thomas Jesup stepped down and placed Taylor in command of all American troops in Florida , a position he held for two years . His reputation as a military leader was growing , and with it , he began to be known as " Old Rough and Ready . " Taylor was criticized for using bloodhounds in order to track Seminole . After his long @-@ requested relief was granted , Taylor spent a comfortable year touring the nation with his family and meeting with military leaders . During this period , he began to be interested in politics and corresponded with President William Henry Harrison . He was made commander of the Second Department of the Army 's Western Division in May 1841 . The sizable territory ran from the Mississippi River westward , south of the 37th parallel north . Stationed in Arkansas , Taylor enjoyed several uneventful years , spending as much time attending to his land speculation as to military matters . 
 = = = Mexican – American War = = = 
 In anticipation of the annexation of the Republic of Texas , which had established independence in 1836 , Taylor was sent in April 1844 to Fort Jesup in Louisiana . He was ordered to guard against any attempts by Mexico to reclaim the territory . He served there until July 1845 , when annexation became imminent , and President James K. Polk directed him to deploy into disputed territory in Texas , " on or near the Rio Grande " near Mexico . Taylor chose a spot at Corpus Christi , and his Army of Occupation encamped there until the following spring in anticipation of a Mexican attack . 
 Taylor 's men advanced to the Rio Grande in March 1846 . Polk 's attempts to negotiate with Mexico had failed , and war appeared imminent . Violence broke out several weeks later , when some of Captain Seth B. Thornton 's men were attacked by Mexican forces north of the river . Polk , learning of the Thornton Affair , told Congress in May that a war between Mexico and the U.S. had begun . That same month , Taylor commanded American forces at the Battle of Palo Alto and the nearby Battle of Resaca de la Palma . Though greatly outnumbered , he defeated the Mexican force , which consisted of the Army of the North , commanded by General Mariano Arista , and forced the troops back across the Rio Grande . These victories made him a popular hero , and within weeks he received a brevet promotion to major general and a formal commendation from Congress . The national press compared him to George Washington and Andrew Jackson , both generals who had ascended to the presidency , although Taylor denied any interest in running for office . " Such an idea never entered my head , " he remarked in a letter , " nor is it likely to enter the head of any sane person . " 
 In September , Taylor , after crossing the Rio Grande , inflicted heavy casualties upon the Mexican defenders at the Battle of Monterrey . The city of Monterrey had been considered " impregnable " , but was captured in three days , forcing Mexican forces to retreat . Taylor was criticized for signing a " liberal " truce , rather than pressing for a large @-@ scale surrender . Afterwards , half of Taylor 's army was ordered to join General Winfield Scott 's soldiers as they besieged Veracruz . Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna discovered , through an intercepted letter from Scott , that Taylor had contributed all but 6 @,@ 000 of his men to the effort . His remaining force included only a few hundred regular army soldiers , and Santa Anna resolved to take advantage of the situation . 
 Santa Anna attacked Taylor with 20 @,@ 000 men at the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847 , leaving around 700 Americans dead or wounded at a cost of over 1 @,@ 500 Mexican . <unk> , the Mexican forces retreated , ensuring a " far @-@ reaching " victory for the Americans . 
 In recognition of his victory at Buena Vista , Taylor was elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati on July 4 , 1847 . Taylor 's father had been an Original Member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati . Unfortunately for the younger Taylor , the Virginia society had disbanded shortly before the elder Taylor 's death , which prevented him from succeeding to his father 's " seat " in the Society . Taylor was a member of the Aztec Club of 1847 , Military Society of the Mexican War . 
 Taylor remained at Monterrey until late November 1847 , when he set sail for home . While he would spend the following year in command of the Army 's entire western division , his active military career was over . In December he received a hero 's welcome in New Orleans and Baton Rouge , and his popular legacy set the stage for the 1848 presidential election . 
 = = Election of 1848 = = 
 In his capacity as a career officer , Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time . He thought of himself as an independent , believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country , and thought that President Andrew Jackson , a Democrat , should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836 . He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S. , as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar ( both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery ) could be easily grown there through a plantation economy . He was also a firm nationalist , and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare , he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems . Taylor , although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements , aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies : the President should not be able to veto a law , unless that law was against the Constitution ; that the office should not interfere with Congress ; and that the power of collective decision @-@ making , as well as the Cabinet , should be strong . 
 Well before the American victory at Buena Vista , political clubs were formed which supported Taylor for President . His support was drawn from an unusually broad assortment of political bands , including Whigs and Democrats , Northerners and Southerners , allies and opponents of national leaders such as Henry Clay and James K. Polk . By late 1846 Taylor 's opposition to a presidential run began to weaken , and it became clear that his principles more closely resembled Whig orthodoxy . Still , he maintained that he would only accept election as a national , independent figure , rather than a partisan loyalist . Taylor declared , as the 1848 Whig Party convention approached , that he had always been a Whig in principle , but he did consider himself a Jeffersonian @-@ Democrat . Many southerners believed that Taylor supported slavery and its expansion into the new territory absorbed from Mexico , and some were angered when Taylor suggested that if he were elected President he would not veto the Wilmot Proviso , which proposed against such an expansion . This position did not enhance his support from activist antislavery elements in the Northern U.S. , as these wanted Taylor to speak out strongly in support of the Proviso , not simply fail to veto it . Most abolitionists did not support Taylor , since he was a slave @-@ owner . Many southerners also knew that Taylor supported states ' rights and was opposed to protective tariffs and government spending for internal improvements . The Whigs hoped that he put the federal union of the United States above all else . 
 Taylor received the Whig nomination for President in 1848 . For his Vice Presidential nominee the convention chose Millard Fillmore , a prominent New York Whig who had chaired the House Ways and Means Committee and had been a contender for Henry Clay 's Vice Presidential nominee in the 1844 election . Fillmore 's selection was largely an attempt at reconciliation with northern Whigs , who were furious at the election of a slaveowning southerner ; all factions of the party were dissatisfied with the final ticket . Taylor continued to minimize his role in the campaign , preferring not to directly meet with voters or correspond regarding his political views . His campaign was skillfully directed by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky , a friend and early political supporter , and bolstered by a late endorsement from Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts . Taylor defeated Lewis Cass , the Democratic candidate , and Martin Van Buren , the Free Soil candidate . 
 Taylor ignored the Whig platform , as historian Michael F. Holt explains : 
 Taylor was equally indifferent to programs Whigs had long considered vital . Publicly , he was artfully ambiguous , refusing to answer questions about his views on banking , the tariff , and internal improvements . Privately , he was more forthright . The idea of a national bank " is dead , and will not be revived in my time . " In the future the tariff " will be increased only for revenue " ; in other words , Whig hopes of restoring the protective tariff of 1842 were vain . There would never again be surplus federal funds from public land sales to distribute to the states , and internal improvements " will go on in spite of presidential vetoes . " In a few words , that is , Taylor pronounced an epitaph for the entire Whig economic program . 
 = = Presidency ( 1849 – 1850 ) = = 
 = = = Transition and inauguration = = = 
 As president @-@ elect , Taylor kept his distance from Washington , not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849 . He spent the months following the election formulating his cabinet selections . He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions , to the frustration of his fellow Whigs . While he despised patronage and political games , he endured a flurry of advances from office @-@ seekers looking to play a role in his administration . 
 While he would not appoint any Democrats , Taylor wanted his cabinet to reflect the nation 's diverse interests , and so apportioned the seats geographically . He also avoided choosing prominent Whigs , sidestepping such obvious selections as Clay . He saw Crittenden as a cornerstone of his administration , offering him the crucial seat of Secretary of State , but Crittenden insisted on serving out the Governorship of Kentucky to which he had just been elected . Taylor settled instead on Senator John M. Clayton of Delaware , a close associate of Crittenden 's . 
 Taylor began his trek to Washington in late January , a journey rife with bad weather , delays , injuries , sickness — and an abduction by a family friend . Taylor finally arrived in the nation 's capital on February 24 and soon met with the outgoing President Polk . The incumbent Democrat held a low opinion of Taylor , privately deeming him " without political information " and " wholly unqualified for the station " of President . Taylor spent the following week meeting with political elites , some of whom were unimpressed with his appearance and demeanor . With less than two weeks until his inauguration , he met with Clayton and hastily finalized his cabinet . 
 Taylor 's term as president began Sunday , March 4 , but his inauguration was not held until the following day out of religious concerns . His inauguration speech discussed the many tasks facing the nation , but presented a governing style of deference to Congress and sectional compromise instead of assertive executive action . Throughout the summer of 1849 , Taylor toured the northeastern U.S. , to familiarize himself with a region of which he had seen little . He spent much of the trip plagued by gastrointestinal illness and returned to Washington by September . 
 = = = Sectional crisis = = = 
 As Taylor took office , Congress faced a battery of questions related to the Mexican Cession , comprising three major territories acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War : California , New Mexico , and Utah . It was unclear which of the acquisitions would achieve statehood and which would remain federal territories , while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress . While a southern slaveowner himself , Taylor had no particular bias toward the southern faction of Congress which sought to maintain its right to slavery . His major goal was sectional peace , preserving the Union through legislative compromise . As the threat of Southern secession grew , he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator William H. Seward of New York , even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk . 
 In Taylor 's view , the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory , as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress 's hands . The timing for statehood was in Taylor 's favor , as the Gold Rush was well underway at the time of his inauguration , and California 's population was exploding . The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California , to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood , knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti @-@ slavery constitution . King found that a constitutional convention was already underway , and by October 1849 , the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union — and to ban slavery within their borders . 
 The question of the New Mexico – Texas border was unsettled at the time of Taylor 's inauguration . The territory newly won from Mexico was under federal jurisdiction , but the Texans claimed a swath of land north of Santa Fe and were determined to include it within their borders , despite having no significant presence there . Taylor sided with the New Mexicans ' claim , initially pushing to keep it as a federal territory , but eventually supported statehood so as to further reduce the slavery debate in Congress . The Texas government , under newly instated governor P. <unk> Bell , tried to ramp up military action in defense of the territory against the federal government , but was unsuccessful . 
 The Latter Day Saint settlers of modern @-@ day Utah had established a provisional State of Deseret , an enormous swath of territory which had little hope of recognition by Congress . The Taylor administration considered combining the California and Utah territories , but instead opted to organize the Utah Territory . To alleviate the Mormon population 's concerns over religious freedom , Taylor promised they would have relative independence from Congress despite being a federal territory . 
 Taylor sent his only State of the Union report to Congress in December 1849 . He recapped international events and suggested several adjustments to tariff policy and executive organization , but such issues were overshadowed by the sectional crisis facing Congress . He reported on California 's and New Mexico 's applications for statehood , and recommended that Congress approve them as written and " should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character " . The policy report was prosaic and unemotional , but ended with a sharp condemnation of secessionists . It had no effect on Southern legislators , who saw the admission of two free states as an existential threat , and Congress remained stalled . 
 = = = Foreign affairs = = = 
 Taylor and his Secretary of State , John M. Clayton , both lacked diplomatic experience , and came into office at a relatively uneventful time in American – international politics . Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight , although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration . As opponents of the autocratic European order , they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848 , although they offered little in the way of aid . A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced , and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh words from the Taylor administration . In a more positive effort , the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom 's search for a team of British explorers , led by John Franklin , who had gotten lost in the Arctic . While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative , the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East . 
 Throughout 1849 and 1850 , they contended with Narciso López , the Venezuelan radical who led repeated filibustering expeditions in an attempt to conquer the island of Cuba . While López made generous offers to American military leaders to support him , Taylor and Clayton saw the enterprise as illegal . They issued a blockade , and later , authorized a mass arrest of López and his fellows , although the group would eventually be acquitted . They also confronted Spain , which had arrested several Americans on the charge of piracy , but the Spaniards eventually surrendered them to maintain good relations with the U.S. 
 Arguably the Taylor administration 's definitive accomplishment in foreign policy was the Clayton – Bulwer Treaty of 1850 , regarding a proposed inter @-@ oceanic canal through Central America . While the U.S. and Britain were on friendly terms , and the construction of such a canal was decades away from reality , the mere possibility put the two nations in an uneasy position . For several years , Britain had been seizing strategic points , particularly the Mosquito Coast on the eastern coast of present @-@ day Nicaragua . Negotiations were held with Britain that resulted in the landmark Clayton – Bulwer Treaty . Both nations agreed not to claim control of any canal that might be built in Nicaragua . The treaty promoted development of an Anglo @-@ American alliance ; its completion was Taylor 's last action as president . 
 = = = Compromise attempts and final days = = = 
 Clay took a central role as Congress debated the slavery question . While his positions had some overlap with Taylor 's , the president always maintained his distance from Clay . Historians disagree on his motivations for doing so . With assistance from Daniel Webster , Clay developed his landmark proposal , the Compromise of 1850 . The proposal allowed statehood for California , giving it independence on the slavery question , while the other territories would remain under federal jurisdiction . This would include the disputed parts of New Mexico , although Texas would be reimbursed for the territory . Slavery would be retained in the District of Columbia , but the slave trade would be banned . Meanwhile , a strict Fugitive Slave Law would be enacted , bypassing northern legislation which had restricted Southerners from retrieving runaway slaves . Tensions flared as Congress negotiated and secession talks grew , culminating with a threat from Taylor to send troops into New Mexico to protect its border from Texas , with himself leading the army . Taylor also said that anyone " taken in rebellion against the Union , he would hang ... with less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico . " The omnibus law was a major step forward but ultimately could not pass , due to extremists on both sides . 
 No great compromise reached Taylor 's desk during his presidency ; instead , his last days were overshadowed by the Galphin affair . Before joining the Taylor cabinet , Secretary of War George W. Crawford had served as a lawyer . He had been involved in a fifteen @-@ year case , representing the descendants of a colonial trader whose services to the British crown had not been repaid at the time of the American Revolution . The British debt to George Galphin was to be assumed by the federal government , but Galphin 's heirs only received payment on the debt 's principal after years of litigation , and were unable to win an interest payment from the Polk administration . 
 Taylor 's Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith , with the support of Attorney General Reverdy Johnson , finally signed off on the payment in April 1850 . To the president 's embarrassment , this payment included a legal compensation of nearly $ 100 @,@ 000 to Crawford ; two cabinet members had effectively offered a tremendous chunk of the public treasury to another . A House investigation cleared Crawford of any legal wrongdoing , but nonetheless expressed disapproval of his accepting the payment . Taylor , who had already been sketching out a re @-@ organization of his cabinet , now had an unfolding scandal to complicate the situation . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 On July 4 , 1850 , Taylor reportedly consumed raw fruit and iced milk while attending holiday celebrations and a fund @-@ raising event at the Washington Monument , which was then under construction . Over the course of several days , he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment . His doctor " diagnosed the illness as cholera morbus , a flexible mid @-@ nineteenth @-@ century term for intestinal ailments as diverse as diarrhea and dysentery but not related to Asiatic cholera , " the latter being a widespread epidemic at the time of Taylor 's death . The identity and source of Taylor 's illness are the subject of historical speculation ( see below ) , although it is known that several of his cabinet members had come down with a similar illness . 
 Fever ensued and Taylor 's chance of recovery was small . On July 8 , Taylor remarked to a medical attendant : 
 I should not be surprised if this were to terminate in my death . I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency . God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty . But I have been mistaken . My motives have been misconstrued , and my feelings most grossly outraged . 
 Despite treatment , Taylor died at 10 : 35 p.m. on July 9 , 1850 . He was 65 years old . After his death , Vice President Millard Fillmore assumed the presidency and completed Taylor 's term , which ended on March 4 , 1853 . 
 Taylor was interred in the Public Vault of the Congressional Cemetery in Washington , D.C. , from July 13 , 1850 , to October 25 , 1850 . ( It was built in 1835 to hold remains of notables until either the grave site could be prepared or transportation arranged to another city . ) His body was transported to the Taylor Family plot where his parents were buried on the old Taylor homestead plantation known as " Springfield " in Louisville , Kentucky .

 Because of his short tenure , Taylor is not considered to have strongly influenced the office of the Presidency or the United States . Some historians believe that Taylor was too inexperienced with politics , at a time when officials needed close ties with political operatives . Despite his shortcomings , the Clayton – Bulwer Treaty affecting relations with Great Britain in Central America is " recognized as an important step in scaling down the nation 's commitment to Manifest Destiny as a policy . " While historical rankings of Presidents of the United States have generally placed Taylor in the bottom quarter of chief executives , most surveys tend to rank him as the most effective of the four Presidents from the Whig Party . 
 Taylor was the last President to own slaves while in office . He was the third of four Whig presidents , the last being Fillmore , his successor . Taylor was also the second president to die in office , preceded by William Henry Harrison who died while serving as President nine years earlier , as well as the only President elected from Louisiana . 
 In 1883 , the Commonwealth of Kentucky placed a 50 @-@ foot monument topped by a life @-@ sized statue of Taylor near his grave . By the 1920s , the Taylor family initiated the effort to turn the Taylor burial grounds into a national cemetery . The Commonwealth of Kentucky donated two adjacent parcels of land for the project , turning the half @-@ acre Taylor family cemetery into 16 acres ( 65 @,@ 000 m2 ) . On May 6 , 1926 , the remains of Taylor and his wife ( who died in 1852 ) were moved to the newly constructed Taylor mausoleum , made of limestone with a granite base and marble interior , nearby . The cemetery property has been designated as the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery . 
 The US Post Office released the first postage stamp issue honoring Zachary Taylor on June 21 , 1875 , 25 years after his death . In 1938 , Taylor would appear again on a US Postage stamp , this time on the 12 @-@ cent Presidential Issue of 1938 . Taylor 's last appearance ( to date , 2010 ) on a US postage stamp occurred in 1986 when he was honored on the <unk> presidential issue . After Washington , Jefferson , Jackson and Lincoln , Zachary Taylor was the fifth American president to appear on US postage . 
 He is the namesake for several names and places throughout the United States , including : 
 Camp Taylor in Kentucky and Fort Taylor in Florida . 
 The SS Zachary Taylor , a World War II Liberty ship 
 Zachary Taylor Parkway in Louisiana and in Zachary Taylor Hall at Southeastern Louisiana University . 
 Taylor County in Georgia 
 Taylor County , Iowa 
 Taylor County , Kentucky The 100th county established in Kentucky and was named after Zachary Taylor . 
 Rough and Ready , California ; the historical origin of the town is depicted in a 1965 episode of the syndicated western television series , Death Valley Days . 
 Zachary Taylor Highway in Virginia 
 He was also the namesake for architect Zachary Taylor Davis . 
 = = Assassination theories = = 
 Almost immediately after his death , rumors began to circulate that Taylor was poisoned by pro @-@ slavery Southerners , and similar theories persisted into the 20th century . In 1978 , Hamilton Smith based his assassination theory on the timing of drugs , the lack of confirmed cholera outbreaks , and other material . In the late 1980s , Clara Rising , a former professor at University of Florida , persuaded Taylor 's closest living relative to agree to an exhumation so that his remains could be tested . The remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the Kentucky Chief Medical Examiner on June 17 , 1991 . Samples of hair , fingernail , and other tissues were removed , and radiological studies were conducted . The remains were returned to the cemetery and reinterred , with appropriate honors , in the mausoleum . 
 Neutron activation analysis conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory revealed no evidence of poisoning , as arsenic levels were too low . The analysis concluded Taylor had contracted " cholera morbus , or acute gastroenteritis " , as Washington had open sewers , and his food or drink may have been contaminated . Any potential for recovery was overwhelmed by his doctors , who treated him with " ipecac , calomel , opium , and quinine ( at 40 grains per dose ) , and bled and blistered him too . " Political scientist Michael Parenti questions the traditional explanation for Taylor 's death . Relying on interviews and reports by forensic pathologists , he argues that the procedure used to test for arsenic poisoning was fundamentally flawed . A 2010 review concludes : " there is no definitive proof that Taylor was assassinated , nor would it appear that there is definitive proof that he was not . " 
 = Bloc Party = 
 Bloc Party are an English indie rock band , currently composed of Kele Okereke ( lead vocals , rhythm guitar , keyboards , sampler ) , Russell Lissack ( lead guitar , keyboards ) , Justin Harris ( bass guitar , keyboards , saxophones , backing vocals ) and Louise Bartle ( drums ) . Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively . Their brand of music , whilst rooted in rock , retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music . The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack . They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003 . Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in NME magazine , while Tong was picked via an audition . Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand 's lead singer , Alex Kapranos , a copy of their demo " She 's Hearing Voices " . 
 In February 2005 , the band released their debut album Silent Alarm . It was critically acclaimed and was named Indie Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards and NME Album of the year which both honour indie music . That year , the record was also certified platinum in Britain . The band built on this success in 2007 with the release of their second studio album , A Weekend in the City , which reached a peak of number two in the UK Albums Chart and number twelve in the Billboard 200 . In August 2008 , Bloc Party released their third studio record , Intimacy which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight and number eighteen on the Billboard 200 . The band went on a hiatus in October 2009 to focus on side projects . They reunited in September 2011 , and shortly thereafter released their fourth album , Four , which entered the UK Albums Chart at number three . In 2013 , Bloc Party released their third EP titled The Nextwave Sessions in August ; the band then began an indefinite hiatus to continue with their respective side projects . The band 's fifth studio album , Hymns , the first to involve Harris and Bartle , was released on 29 January 2016 . Bloc Party have sold over 3 million albums worldwide .

 Russell Lissack and Kele Okereke first met in 1998 in London . Lissack had attended Bancroft 's School , while Okereke attended Ilford County High School , then Trinity Catholic High School , Woodford Green for sixth form . They bumped into each other again in 1999 at Reading Festival and decided to form a band . Bassist Gordon Moakes joined after answering an advert in NME , and drummer Matt Tong joined after an audition . After going through a variety of names , such as Union , The Angel Range , and Diet , the band settled on Bloc Party in September 2003 , a play on block party . The band has said that the name was not intended to be an allusion to the Soviet Bloc or the Canadian political party Bloc Québécois . However , Moakes said on the group 's official Internet forum that it was more a merging of the eastern " <unk> " and the western " parties " , in the political sense . He also notes that the name was not explicitly driven by politics , but rather it " looked , sounded , seemed fine so we went with it . " 
 In November 2003 , Bloc Party had their track " The Marshals Are Dead " featured on a compilation CD called The New Cross released by Angular Recording Corporation . They then released their debut single " She 's Hearing Voices " on the then fledgling record label Trash Aesthetics . The band got their break after Okereke went to a Franz Ferdinand concert in 2003 , and gave a copy of " She 's Hearing Voices " to both lead singer Alex Kapranos and BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq . Lamacq subsequently played the song on his radio show , labelling the track " genius " , and invited them to record a live session for the show . The buzz generated off the back of the single led to another release , " Banquet / Staying Fat " , this time through Moshi Moshi Records , and to the eventual signing with independent label Wichita Recordings in April 2004 . 
 = = = Silent Alarm ( 2004 – 2006 ) = = = 
 Bloc Party 's debut album , Silent Alarm , was released in February 2005 and was met with universal critical acclaim . It was voted ' Album of the Year ' for 2005 by NME , and reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart before being certified platinum . The first single from the album , " So Here We Are / Positive Tension " , made the top 5 on the UK Top 40 chart . Further singles " Banquet " ( which reached number 13 in NME 's ' Top 50 Singles of 2005 ' ) , " Helicopter " , and " Pioneers " , whilst failing to repeat this success , still managed to reach the UK top 20 . The animated video for " Pioneers , " made by the Shoreditch @-@ based <unk> design agency , was top of the NME video charts for four weeks . NME tagged them as " art @-@ rock " at that time but the band felt it was too limited . 
 The band received positive reviews from critics in the United States and they toured there heavily in the 18 months that followed the release of Silent Alarm . In early 2006 , they finished their tour with sold out shows in Los Angeles , Miami and Berkeley . The album went on to sell more than 350 @,@ 000 copies in North America and over a million worldwide . After this success , the established electronic group , The Chemical Brothers , soon collaborated with Okereke for " Believe " , a track on their Push the Button album . An album of remixes of tracks from Silent Alarm had also been released at the end of August 2005 in the UK . This remix album , entitled Silent Alarm Remixed , retained the album 's original track list and includes remixes from the likes of Ladytron , M83 , Death from Above 1979 , Four Tet , and Mogwai . 
 During July 2005 , Bloc Party recorded two new tracks with Silent Alarm producer Paul Epworth . The songs were released as a single with a B @-@ side , titled " Two More Years " , to coincide with the band 's October 2005 UK tour . The tour was also accompanied by a re @-@ issue of Silent Alarm , which included " Two More Years " and former single " Little Thoughts " as bonus tracks . A remix of " Banquet " by The Streets , as well as a music video for the song , were included in the " Two More Years " single . Bloc Party also contributed the track " The Present " to the Help ! : A Day in the Life compilation , the profits of which benefited the War Child charity .

 = = Musical style = = 
 Bloc Party 's brand of guitar rock draws on influences such as The Chemical Brothers , The Cure , Manic Street Preachers , Joy Division , Sonic Youth , Blur , and The Smiths . Okereke has also stated that Mogwai 's album Mogwai Young Team changed his life by being his musical " year zero " . Okereke also cites Suede as a major influence , he says Dog Man Star was the first record he fell in love with . Particular parallels were made between Bloc Party and Gang of Four upon their arrival on the music scene , yet the band were " mildly infuriated " at such references , claiming they had never " particularly liked " Gang of Four . To achieve their unique style , numerous delay and other effects pedals are implemented . During the recording of second album A Weekend in the City , the band suggested it would contain " some truly R & B styled beats , a song where [ Tong ] and [ Moakes ] play drums simultaneously [ with ] both eggshell @-@ thin fragility and trouser @-@ flapping hugeness " , as opposed to their typical sound . The style has been compared to and inspired by such bands as Radiohead , U2 , Depeche Mode , and Björk . Some of the most noticeable changes between debut Silent Alarm and A Weekend in the City are that the songs became more layered and less raw due to inclusion of string arrangements . 
 With the release of " Flux " , Bloc Party 's style became even more diverse with the inclusion of electronic music . " Mercury " saw Bloc Party distance themselves even further from the traditional guitar band set @-@ up by experimenting with dark electronic sounds and a brass section inspired by Siouxsie and the Banshees . The band 's third album Intimacy also features synths , processed drum beats and loops , vocal manipulation , and choral arrangements . Even though the album was influenced by electronic music , the band still had not lost their feel for guitar music . For example , in an interview , Okereke said that the band was starting to miss their more traditional sound , and confirmed that may have been the way fourth album was headed . However , Tong contradicted this , stating : " There 's every chance we might go back to more orthodox arrangements or things that resemble a traditional band but I don 't think we 'll ever write songs like we did on Silent Alarm again . " A 2009 Vice Records mix lists the following songs Bloc Party are influenced by : Eagle Boston 's " Wild Wild Ost " , Pylon 's " Working Is No Problem " , Delta 5 's " Mind Your Own Business " , John Foxx 's " Underpass " , Prince 's " I Would Die 4 U " ( also covered live ) , Sonic Youth 's " Youth Against Fascism " , Dinosaur Jr .

 Timeline 
 = Emilia Baeyertz = 
 Emilia Louise Baeyertz ( née Aronson ; 29 March 1842 – 26 April 1926 ) was a Welsh Christian evangelist , born to a strict Jewish family in Wales , who described herself as " the Christian Jewess " . She was home schooled due to her poor health and suffered a breakdown when her fiancé was diagnosed with tuberculosis . Her family sent her to Australia to live with her sister to help her recovery , where she fell in love with and secretly married an Anglican Christian man . 
 Baeyertz did not intend to convert to Christianity when she married him , but she subsequently did for the sake of her children . Her husband died as a result of a shooting accident in 1871 , whereupon she experienced a full conversion to Christianity . She spent the following few years giving sermons and , by 1879 , she was featured speaker for a YWCA campaign of sermons , before spending a decade conducting Christian missions around Victoria . 
 Between 1890 and 1904 , Baeyertz conducted missions around the world , starting in New Zealand , then spending a few years in the US and Canada , before returning to the United Kingdom and Ireland . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Baeyertz was born as Emilia Louise Aronson on 29 March 1842 in Bangor , North Wales . Her family were wealthy orthodox Jews , and she was brought up to strict Jewish ideals . She attended school for a while but , by the time that she reached thirteen , her family removed her from formal education and she remained at home due to her ill health . Instead , she spent her time with her mother , who used to read Shakespeare to her , and would spend time in her family 's library practising reading aloud . 
 When she was old enough , she attended social events and soon met a young Jewish man . He asked her father for her hand in marriage , and the father agreed on the condition that the man take out life insurance . While Emilia was planning the wedding , her fiancé attended doctor 's appointments as part of the insurance underwriting process . There he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and told that he did not have long to live . The wedding was cancelled , and Baeyertz suffered a breakdown and ill health as a result . 
 In February 1864 , her family sent her and her brother to Melbourne to live with her sister , with the intention of helping to improve Baeyertz 's health . By the time that the siblings arrived by ship in Melbourne , Baeyertz had already recovered and she quickly integrated herself into the Australian social life . She soon met Charles Baeyertz , a bank manager at the Richmond branch of National Bank of Australasia and a practising Anglican . The couple started a relationship , keeping it secret from both their families . 
 Baeyertz agreed to marry Charles on the condition that he would never attempt to convert her to Christianity — indeed , that he would never mention his religion to her at all . The couple married in secret at Christ Church in Hawthorn , Victoria on 16 October 1865 . Soon after , the Baeyertz 's family discovered the marriage and disowned her for marrying a non @-@ Jewish man . They moved to Colac , Victoria where Charles found a new role as bank manager for the National Bank of Australasia , and they had two children , son Nalder who went on to be a journalist and establish a New Zealand magazine , and daughter Marion . Baeyertz started attending church with her husband , and she decided to convert to Christianity for her children 's sake towards the end of the 1860s , when Marion was baptised . She didn 't believe in the Christian tenets , so she had a friend fill in her baptism application to ensure that the answers were correct . 
 = = Evangelical work = = 
 Baeyertz 's husband died on 6 March 1871 at the age of 28 , two days after a shooting accident . She turned to the Anglican church to help her and she experienced a full conversion to the religion . She put her children into boarding school and became an evangelist , visiting jails and hospitals to spread the religion , as well as door @-@ to @-@ door preaching to the Jewish areas of Melbourne . She did not manage to convert anyone , and ended up with her life threatened . 
 Baeyertz joined the YWCA and was soon preaching to large crowds . By 1879 , she was the featured speaker for a campaign of sermons in Sandhurst , eventually converting 200 individuals . She then conducted a Christian mission to Ballarat , with crowds of 2 @,@ 300 assembling to hear her talk . Emilia conducted a number of further missions around Victoria between 1880 and 1890 . In 1890 , she went to New Zealand to preach , before moving on to North America . She arrived in San Francisco in October 1890 , and spent two years giving sermons in conjunction with the YMCA in Los Angeles , San Francisco , and Boston in USA as well as Toronto and Ottawa in Canada . 
 In 1892 , Baeyertz returned to the United Kingdom , preaching and conducting missions in Ireland , Scotland , and England . There she would preach to packed halls , sometimes to just women , earning £ 43 in a fortnight ( worth about £ 17 @,@ 000 in 2014 ) . She remained in her London base until 1904 , when she returned to Australia . Emilia arrived in Perth in May 1904 , remaining there for a year before returning to Victoria . Towards the end of her life , she returned to England . She conducted a few missions before her death on 26 April 1926 in Surrey . 
 = Ragnar Nurkse 's balanced growth theory = 
 The balanced growth theory is an economic theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse ( 1907 – 1959 ) . The theory hypothesises that the government of any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously . This will enlarge the market size , increase productivity , and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest . 
 Nurkse was in favour of attaining balanced growth in both the industrial and agricultural sectors of the economy . He recognised that the expansion and inter @-@ sectoral balance between agriculture and manufacturing is necessary so that each of these sectors provides a market for the products of the other and in turn , supplies the necessary raw materials for the development and growth of the other . 
 Nurkse and Paul Rosenstein @-@ Rodan were the pioneers of balanced growth theory and much of how it is understood today dates back to their work . 
 Nurkse 's theory discusses how the poor size of the market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state . Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity . According to him , if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country , its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy . Apart from this , Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist , as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory . No importance should be given to promoting exports . 
 = = Size of market and inducement to invest = = 
 The size of a market assumes primary importance in the study of what induces investment in a country . Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A. Young to assert that inducement to invest is limited by the size of the market . The original idea behind this was put forward by Adam Smith , who stated that division of labour ( as against inducement to invest ) is limited by the extent of the market . 
 According to Nurkse , underdeveloped countries lack adequate purchasing power . Low purchasing power means that the real income of the people is low , although in monetary terms it may be high . If the money income were low , the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply ; however , since the meaning in this context is real income , expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure . Neither real output nor real investment will rise . It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low . Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services , this includes the demand for capital as well . 
 The size of the market determines the incentive to invest irrespective of the nature of the economy . This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product . For example , if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in , he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high . He would prefer to invest in a developed country , where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries , the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand . 
 Private entrepreneurs sometimes resort to heavy advertising as a means of attracting buyers for their products . Although this may lead to a rise in demand for that entrepreneur 's good or service , it does not actually raise the aggregate demand in the economy . The demand merely shifts from one provider to another . Clearly , this is not a long @-@ term solution . 
 Ragnar Nurkse concluded , 
 " The limited size of the domestic market in a low income country can thus constitute an obstacle to the application of capital by any individual firm or industry working for the market . In this sense the small domestic market is an obstacle to development generally . " 
 = = Determinants of size of market = = 
 According to Nurkse , expanding the size of the market is crucial to increasing the inducement to invest . Only then can the vicious circle of poverty be broken . He mentioned the following pertinent points about how the size of the market is determined : 
 = = = Money supply = = = 
 Nurkse emphasised that Keynesian theory shouldn 't be applied to underdeveloped countries because they don 't face a lack of effective demand in the way that developed countries do . Their problem is to do with a lack of real purchasing power due to low productivity levels . Thus , merely increasing the supply of money will not expand the market but will in fact cause inflationary pressure . 
 = = = Population = = = 
 Nurkse argued against the notion that a large population implies a large market . Though underdeveloped countries have a large population , their levels of productivity are low . This results in low levels of per capita real income . Thus , consumption expenditure is low , and savings are either very low or completely absent . On the other hand , developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity , their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services . 
 = = = Geographical area = = = 
 Nurkse also refuted the claim that if a country 's geographical area is large , the size of its market also ought to be large . A country may be extremely small in area but still have a large effective demand . For example , Japan . In contrast , a country may cover a huge geographical area but its market may still be small . This may occur if a large part of the country is uninhabitable , or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low National Income . 
 = = = Transport cost and trade barriers = = = 
 The notion that transport costs and trade barriers hinder the expansion of the market is age @-@ old . Nurkse emphasised that tariff duties , exchange controls , import quotas and other non @-@ tariff barriers to trade are major obstacles to promoting international cooperation in exporting and importing . More specifically , due to high transport costs between nations , producers do not have an incentive to export their commodities . As a result , the amount of capital accumulation remains small . To address this problem , the United Nations produced a report in 1951 with solutions for underdeveloped countries . They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries . Also , they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether . The logic was that once customs duties are removed , transport costs will fall . Consequently , prices will fall and thus the demand will rise . However , Nurkse , as an export pessimist , did not agree with this view . Export pessimism is a trade theory which is governed by the idea of " inward looking growth " as opposed to " outward looking growth " . ( See Import substitution industrialization ) 
 = = = Sales promotion = = = 
 Often , it is true that a company 's private endeavour to increase the demand for its products succeeds due to the extensive use of advertisement and other sales promotion technique . However , Nurkse argues that such activities cannot succeed at the macro level to increase a country 's aggregate demand level . He calls this the " macroeconomic paradox " . 
 = = = Productivity = = = 
 Nurkse stressed productivity as the primary determinant of the size of the market . An increase in productivity ( defined as the output per unit input ) increases the flow of goods and services in the economy . As a response , consumption also rises . Hence , underdeveloped economies should aim to raise their productivity levels in all sectors of the economy , in particular agriculture and industry . 
 For example , in most underdeveloped economies , the technology used to carry out agricultural activities is backward . There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence . So while a large proportion of the population ( 70 @-@ 80 % ) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector , the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40 % . This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head . This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities , high @-@ yielding variety seeds , pesticides , fertilisers , tractors etc . The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power ( real income ) . Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country . Thus , the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country . 
 Nurkse is of the opinion that Say 's Law of markets operates in underdeveloped countries . Thus , if the money incomes of the people rise while the price level in the economy stays the same , the size of the market will still not expand till the real income and productivity levels rise . To quote Nurkse , 
 " In underdeveloped areas there is generally no ' deflationary gap ' through excessive savings . Production creates its own demand , and the size of the market depends on the volume of production . In the last analysis , the market can be enlarged only through all @-@ round increase in productivity . Capacity to buy means capacity to produce . " 
 = = Export pessimism = = 
 Citing the limited size of the market as the main impediment in economic growth , Nurkse reasons that an increase in productivity can create a virtuous circle of growth . Thus , a large scale investment programme in a wide array of industries simultaneously is the answer . The increase in demand for one industry will lead to an increase in demand for another industry due to complementarity of demands . As Say 's Law states , supply creates its own demand . 
 However , Nurkse clarified that the finance for this development must arise to as large an extent as possible from the underdeveloped country itself i.e. domestically . He stated that financing through increased trade or foreign investments was a strategy used in the past - the 19th century - and its success was limited to the case of the United States of America . In reality , the so @-@ called " new countries " of the United States of America ( which separated from the British empire ) were high income countries to begin with . They were already endowed with efficient producers , effective markets and a high purchasing power . The point Nurkse was trying to make was that USA was rich in resource endowment as well as labour force . The labour force had merely migrated from Britain to USA , and thus their level of skills were advanced to begin with . This situation of outward led growth was therefore unique and not replicable by underdeveloped countries . 
 In fact , if such a strategy of financing development from outside the home country is undertaken , it creates a number of problems . For example , the foreign investors may carelessly misuse the resources of the underdeveloped country . This would in turn limit that economy 's ability to diversify , especially if natural resources were plundered . This may also create a distorted social structure . Apart from this , there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption . People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a balance of payments crisis may develop , along with economic inequality within the population . 
 Another reason exports cannot be promoted is because in all likelihood , an underdeveloped country may only be skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods , say agricultural goods . However , since such commodities face inelastic demand , the extent to which they will sell in the market is limited . Although when population is at a rise , additional demand for exports may be created , Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth . For Nurkse , then , exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out . 
 Thus , for a large @-@ scale development to be feasible , the requisite capital must be generated from within the country itself , and not through export surplus or foreign investment . Only then can productivity increase and lead to increasing returns to scale and eventually create virtuous circles of growth . 
 = = Role of state = = 
 After World War II , a debate about whether a country should introduce financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged . Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists . It is an administrative problem . The crucial idea was that a large amount of well dispersed investment should be made in the economy , so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels , increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question . However , it should be noted that most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates . Further , the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 Ragnar Nurkse 's balanced growth theory too has been criticised on a number of grounds . His main critic was Albert O. Hirschman , the pioneer of the strategy of unbalanced growth . Hans W. Singer also criticised certain aspects of the theory . 
 Hirschman stressed the fact that underdeveloped economies are called underdeveloped because they face a lack of resources , maybe not natural resources , but resources such as skilled labour and technology . Thus , to hypothesise that an underdeveloped nation can undertake large scale investment in many industries of its economy simultaneously is unrealistic due to the paucity of resources . To quote Hirschman , 
 " If a country were ready to apply the doctrine of balanced growth , then it would not be underdeveloped in the first place . " 
 Hans Singer asserted that the balanced growth theory is more applicable to cure an economy facing a cyclical downswing . <unk> downswing is a feature of an advanced stage of sustained growth rather than of the vicious cycle of poverty . Hirschman also stated that during conditions of slack activity in developed countries , the stock of resources , machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed , and are present as idle capacity . So in this situation , simultaneous investment in a large number of sectors is a well @-@ suited policy . The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating , the slump will be overcome . However , for an underdeveloped economy , where such resources are absent , this principle doesn 't fit . 
 Another contention was Nurkse 's approval of Say 's Law , which theorises that there is no overproduction or glut in the economy . Supply ( production of goods and services ) creates a matching demand for the output and this results in the entire output being sold and consumed . However , Keynes stated that Say 's Law is not operational in any country because people do not spend their entire income - a fraction of it is saved for future consumption . Thus , according to Nurkse 's critics , his assumption of Say 's Law being operational in underdeveloped countries needs greater justification . Even if the section of savers is few , the tenet of putting emphasis on supply rather than demand has been widely discredited . 
 Nurkse states that if demand for the output of one sector rises , due to the complementary nature of demand , the demand for the output of other industries will also experience a rise . Paul Rosenstein @-@ Rodan spoke of a similar concept called " indivisibility of demand " which hypothesises that if large investments are made in a large number of industries simultaneously , an underdeveloped economy can become developed due to the phenomenon of complementary demand . However , both Nurkse and Rosenstein @-@ Rodan only took into consideration the situation of industries that produce complementary goods . There are substitute goods too , which are in competition with each other . Thus if the state pumps in large investments into the car industry , for example , it will naturally lead to a rise in the demand for petrol . But if the state makes large scale investments in the coffee sector of a country , the tea sector will suffer . 
 Hans Singer suggested that Nurkse 's theory makes dubious assumptions about the underdeveloped economy . For example , Nurkse assumes that the economy starts with nothing at hand . However , an economy usually starts at a position which reflects the previous investment decisions undertaken in the country , and at any given moment , an imbalance already exists . So the logical step would be to take on those investment programmes which compliment the existing imbalance in the economy . Clearly , such an investment cannot be a balanced one . If an economy makes the mistake of setting out to make a balanced investment , a new imbalance is likely to appear which will require still another " balancing investment " to bring equilibrium , and so on and so forth . 
 Hirschman believed that Nurkse 's balanced growth theory wasn 't in fact a theory of growth . Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage . It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity . However , the balanced growth theory involves the creation of a brand new , self @-@ sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant , self @-@ sufficient traditional economy . Thus , there is no transformation . In reality , a dual economy will come into existence , where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country . They will differ on levels of development , technology and demand patterns . This may create inequality in the country . 
 = 7th Army ( Kingdom of Yugoslavia ) = 
 The 7th Army was a Royal Yugoslav Army formation raised prior to the German @-@ led Axis invasion of the Yugoslavia in April 1941 , during World War II . It consisted of two divisions , two brigade @-@ strength mountain detachments , and a brigade @-@ strength infantry detachment . It formed part of the 1st Army Group , and was responsible for the defence of Yugoslavia 's north @-@ western frontier with Italy and the Third Reich . 
 Despite concerns over a possible Axis invasion , orders for the general mobilisation of the Royal Yugoslav Army were not issued by the government until 3 April 1941 , out of fear this would offend Adolf Hitler and precipitate war . When the invasion commenced on 6 April , the 7th Army was only partially mobilised , and on the first day the Germans seized several mountain passes and bridges over the Drava river . Slovene politicians formed a National Council of Slovenia with the intent of separating from Yugoslavia , and on the right flank of the 7th Army , the 4th Army was seriously weakened by Croat fifth column activities within its major units and higher headquarters from the outset . This alarmed the 7th Army commander , Divizijski đeneral Dušan Trifunović , but he was not permitted to withdraw from the border areas until the night of 7 / 8 April , and this was followed by the German capture of Maribor on 8 April as they continued to expand their bridgeheads , supported by the Luftwaffe . 
 On 10 April , the German 14th Panzer Division captured Zagreb . Italian offensive operations began the following day , with thrusts towards Ljubljana and down the Adriatic coast , and resulted in the capture of more than 30 @,@ 000 Yugoslav troops near Delnice . When fifth column supporters of the Croatian nationalist Ustaše movement arrested the headquarters staff of the 7th Army later that day , the formation effectively ceased to exist . On 12 April , the 14th Panzer Division linked up with the Italians near the Adriatic coast , encircling the remnants of the 7th Army , which offered no further resistance . <unk> were implemented from 15 April , and the Yugoslav Supreme Command surrendered unconditionally effective on 18 April . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Kingdom of SCS ) was created with the merger of Serbia , Montenegro and the South Slav @-@ inhabited areas of Austria @-@ Hungary on 1 December 1918 , in the immediate aftermath of World War I. The Army of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes was established at war 's end to defend the new state . It was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army , as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by Austria @-@ Hungary . Many former Austro @-@ Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army . From the beginning , much like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom , the army was dominated by ethnic Serbs , who saw it as a means by which to secure Serb political hegemony . 
 The army 's development was hampered by the kingdom 's poor economy , and this continued through the 1920s . In 1929 , King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , at which time the army was renamed the Royal Yugoslav Army ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije , VKJ ) . The army budget remained tight , and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s , it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries . Consequently , at the time World War II broke out in September 1939 , the VKJ had several serious weaknesses , which included reliance on draught animals for transport , and the large size of its formations . For example , infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26 @,@ 000 – 27 @,@ 000 men , as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength . These characteristics resulted in slow , unwieldy formations , and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower . Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast @-@ moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in their invasions of Poland and France . 
 The weaknesses of the VKJ in strategy , structure , equipment , mobility and supply were exacerbated to a significant degree by serious ethnic disunity within Yugoslavia that had resulted from two decades of Serb hegemony and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government . Attempts to address such disunity came too late to ensure that the VKJ was a cohesive force . Fifth column activity was also a serious concern , not only from the Croatian nationalist Ustaše but also from the country 's Slovene and ethnic German minorities . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Yugoslav war plans foresaw the headquarters of the 7th Army and its army @-@ level supporting units being created at the time of mobilisation . Unlike the other six Yugoslav armies , the 7th Army did not have a corresponding army district during peacetime , and would be allocated divisions when it was formed . Zagreb , Karlovac , <unk> and <unk> <unk> were key centres for the mobilisation and concentration of the 7th Army due to their good rail infrastructure . 
 Prior to the invasion , significant fortifications known as the Rupnik Line were constructed along the Italian and Reich borders , within what became the 7th Army 's area of operations . Along the frontier with Italy , mutually supporting bunkers were established on forward slopes of the mountain ranges behind a belt of obstacles . The main positions followed a line from Mount Blegoš south @-@ south @-@ east through <unk> <unk> , <unk> Vrh , Vrh <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , Mount <unk> , Grahovo , and <unk> to <unk> . To the north of Mount Blegoš , positions ran behind the lines of the <unk> Sora and Sava Bohinjka rivers . Fortifications were also established in the mountainous Gorski kotar region between Karlovac and Fiume on the upper Adriatic coast . Along the Reich border , the Yugoslavs concentrated on preparing to block the passes through the <unk> and Kamnik Alps , and built bunkers behind obstacles along the routes leading south from the border towards Dravograd , Maribor and Ptuj . Preparations were also made to block routes north of the Drava and along the southern banks of the Mura and Drava . These fortifications were to be manned by border guard units , and were not the responsibility of the 7th Army .

 The 7th Army was part of the 1st Army Group , which was responsible for the defence of north @-@ western Yugoslavia , with the 7th Army along the Italian and Reich borders , and the 4th Army defending the eastern sector along the Hungarian border . The 1st Cavalry Division was to be held as the 1st Army Group reserve around Zagreb . On the left of the 7th Army was the Adriatic coast at Karlobag , and the boundary with the 4th Army on the right flank ran from Radgon on the Mura through Krapina and Karlovac to Otočac . The Yugoslav defence plan saw the 7th Army deployed in a cordon along the border region from the Adriatic in the west to Radgon in the east . Of the formations of the 7th Army , the mobilisation of the three detachments was largely complete , but the two divisions had only commenced mobilisation . All 7th Army formations were to be deployed in a cordon , although each formation was to create a second line of defence from its own troops . The headquarters of the 7th Army was to initially be located in Brežice . The planned deployment of the 7th Army from west to east was : 
 Detachment Lika on the upper Adriatic coast from Karlobag through Otočac to Ogulin 
 Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski around Delnice in the mountainous Gorski kotar region , with responsibility for the defence of the Italian border from Sušak on the upper Adriatic coast to <unk>

 After unrelenting pressure from Adolf Hitler , Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941 . On 27 March , a military coup d 'état overthrew the government that had signed the pact , and a new government was formed under the VVKJ commander , Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović . A general mobilisation was not called by the new government until 3 April 1941 , out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war . According to a post @-@ war U.S. Army study , by the time the invasion commenced , the three brigade @-@ sized detachments had mobilised , but the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski and 38th Infantry Division Dravska had only commenced mobilisation .

 = = = 5 – 6 April = = = 
 The border between the Reich and Yugoslavia was unsuitable for motorised operations . Due to the short notice of the invasion , the elements of the invading German 2nd Army that would make up LI Infantry Corps and XLIX Mountain Corps had to be transported from Germany , German @-@ occupied France and the Nazi puppet Slovak Republic , and nearly all encountered difficulties in reaching their assembly areas . In the interim , the Germans formed a special force under the code name Feuerzauber ( Magic Fire ) . This force was initially intended to merely reinforce the <unk> Frontier Guard Division , who were manning the border . On the evening of 5 April , one of the aggressive Feuerzauber detachment commanders , Hauptmann Palten , led his Kampfgruppe Palten across the Mura from Spielfeld and , having secured the bridge , began attacking bunkers and other Yugoslav positions on the high ground , and sent patrols deep into the Yugoslav border fortification system . Due to a lack of Yugoslav counter @-@ attacks , many of these positions remained in German hands into 6 April . 
 On the morning of 6 April , German aircraft conducted surprise attacks on Yugoslav airfields in the 7th Army area , including Ljubljana and Cerklje , where the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group was based . At 07 : 00 , Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters of Jagdgeschwader 27 strafed Ljubljana airfield , attacking hangars and some Potez 25 biplanes . 
 LI Infantry Corps were tasked with attacking towards Maribor then driving towards Zagreb , while the XLIX Mountain Corps was to capture Dravograd then force a crossing on the Sava . At 05 : 00 on 6 April , LI Infantry Corps captured the Drava bridges at Mureck and Radkersburg ( opposite Gornji Radgona ) undamaged . In the sector of the 38th Infantry Division Dravska , one German column pushed towards Maribor from Mureck , and the other pushed on from Gornja Radgona through Lenart towards Ptuj . Some time later , other elements of LI Infantry Corps attacked the area between Sveti Duh and Dravograd . The 7th and 8th Border Regiments met these attacks with fierce resistance , but were forced to withdraw due to German pressure . The 183rd Infantry Division captured 300 prisoners , and a bicycle @-@ mounted detachment of the division reached Murska Sobota without striking any resistance . The 132nd Infantry Division also pushed south along the <unk> valley towards <unk> . By the end of the first day , LI Infantry Corps had occupied Gornja Radgona , Murska Sobota and <unk> , and had crossed the Drava near Sveti Duh . XLIX Mountain Corps captured border crossings on the approaches to Dravograd , but were held up by the 6th Border Regiment in mountain passes located further west at <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Late that day , mountain pioneers destroyed some isolated Yugoslav bunkers in the area penetrated by Kampfgruppe Palten . 
 Later that day , German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 , escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters , caught the Breguet 19s of the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group on the ground at Cerklje and <unk> , destroying most of them . This was followed by attacks by the Italian Air Force on Yugoslav troop concentrations of the 7th Army . The Yugoslav Air Force was unable to interdict the Axis air attacks because the Hawker Hurricanes and Ikarus IK @-@ 2 aircraft of its 4th Fighter Regiment were based 240 kilometres ( 150 mi ) away at Bosanski Aleksandrovac . After having been grounded for most of the day by poor weather , in the afternoon Bristol Blenheim Mk I light bombers of the Yugoslav 68th Bomber Group flew missions against airfields and railway stations across the Reich frontier at Graz , <unk> , Steyr and Wiener Neustadt . 
 By the close of the first day , the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating , and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the fighting was conducted by border troops . The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava , with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj , the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd . German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services . 
 On that day , the governor of the Drava Banovina , Marko Natlačen met with representatives of the major Slovene political parties , and created the National Council of Slovenia ( Slovene : Narodni <unk> za <unk> , NszS ) , whose aim was to establish a Slovenia independent of Yugoslavia . When he heard the news of fifth @-@ column @-@ led revolts within the 4th Army , Trifunović was alarmed , and proposed withdrawal from the border areas , but this was rejected by the commander of the 1st Army Group , Armijski đeneral Milorad Petrović . The front along the border with Italy was relatively quiet , with some patrol clashes occurring , some sporadic artillery bombardments of border fortifications , and an unsuccessful raid by the Italians directed at Mount Blegoš .

 In the early hours of 7 April , three Blenheims of the Yugoslav 8th Bomber Regiment took off from Rovine to bomb the railway junction at <unk> , but became disoriented in bad weather . Only one aircraft found a target in Austria , bombing a bridge and road near Steyr before continuing on to Wiener Neustadt where it was hit by anti @-@ aircraft fire and made an emergency landing . 
 Over the period 7 – 9 April , LI Infantry Corps held the lead elements of its two divisions back to some extent while the rest of each division detrained in Graz and made their way to the border . German forces along the front of the 7th Army continued to push towards Ptuj , Maribor and Dravograd on 7 April , against significant resistance from the 6th , 7th and 8th Border Regiments . The German thrusts towards Ptuj and Maribor broke through the Yugoslav defensive line Pesnica – Lenart – Sveta <unk> v <unk> <unk> – <unk> Vrh , but those advancing towards Dravograd were held up by the 6th Border Regiment and a battalion of the 38th Infantry Division Dravska . Along the Italian border there were only skirmishes caused by Italian reconnaissance @-@ in @-@ force to a depth of 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) . 
 The Yugoslav Supreme Command ordered Petrović to use Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski to capture Fiume , across the Rječina river from Sušak , but the order was soon rescinded due to the deteriorating situation in the flanking 4th Army . In the afternoon of 7 April , Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border . Petrović accepted that this might become necessary if the situation on the immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further , but the idea was opposed by the chief of staff of the headquarters of the 1st Army Group , Armijski đeneral Leon Rupnik , who suggested that Trifunović should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back . At 19 : 30 , the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army . Morale in the 7th Army had started to decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy . 
 = = = 8 April = = = 
 On the night of 7 / 8 April , Petrović ordered Trifunović to begin to withdraw , first to a line through the Dravinja river , Zidani Most bridge and the right bank of the Krka river . Later in the day this was moved back to the line of the Kupa river . This ended the successful defence of the 38th Infantry Division Dravska along the line of the Drava , and meant their withdrawal from Maribor . Disregarding orders from above , Palten exploited their withdrawal by leading his kampfgruppe south towards the town , and crossing the Pesnica river in inflatable boats , leaving his unit vehicles behind . In the evening , Palten and his force entered Maribor unopposed , taking 100 prisoners . For disregarding orders , Palten and his kampfgruppe were ordered to return to Spielfeld , and spent the rest of the invasion guarding the border . In the meantime , the forward elements of the two divisions consolidated their bridgeheads , with the 132nd Infantry Division securing Maribor , and the 183rd Infantry Division pushing past Murska Sobota , reaching <unk> Vrh . 
 Some bridges over the Sava were blown before all elements of the 7th and 8th Border Regiments had withdrawn , but some soldiers were able to swim across , the rest being captured by the advancing Germans . German patrols reached the Drava at Ptuj , and further east at <unk> they found the bridge had been blown . Elements of the XLIX Mountain Corps had pushed forward to Poljana and Dravograd . The German troops received close air support from divebombers and fighters during their advance , while medium bombers hit targets throughout the 7th Army area . The 4th Fighter Regiment clashed several times with German aircraft on 8 April without result . Three Blenheims of the Yugoslav 8th Bomber Regiment again flew a mission to attack a target in southern Austria , escorted by 4th Fighter Regiment Hurricanes , but the rest of the 8th Bomber Regiment was awaiting orders to bomb a rebelling Yugoslav regiment of the neighbouring 4th Army in Bjelovar ; the orders were subsequently cancelled . During the day , the Italian 3rd Alpine Group captured <unk> Gora at the headwaters of the Sava in the sector of Mountain Detachment Triglavski . The German orders for the following day were for LI Infantry Corps to force a crossing of the Drava near <unk> and advance on Zagreb , while XLIX Mountain Corps were to drive towards Celje . 
 = = = 9 April = = = 
 On 9 April , the Germans continued their advance , and all elements of both divisions of LI Infantry Corps had finally unloaded in Graz . In view of German success , the Italian 2nd Army in north @-@ eastern Italy accelerated its preparations and issued orders for its V and XI Corps to conduct preliminary operations aimed at improving their starting positions for the planned attack on Yugoslavia . In the meantime , the 7th Army continued rapidly withdrawing its right wing , while withdrawing its centre and keeping the Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski in place on its left flank . The 38th Infantry Division Dravska continued to withdraw south from Ptuj through Krapina towards Zagreb , while the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski and Mountain Detachment Triglavski fell back to the southern bank of the Krka river . Units of LI Infantry Corps crossed the Drava along the line Maribor — Ptuj and further east , and continued to expand their bridgehead south of Maribor . Elements of XLIX Mountain Corps secured the southern exit of the <unk> railway tunnel near Jesenice and expanded their bridgehead at Dravograd . Italian units made several attacks on the weakened sector of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski and against Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski , and Detachment Lika took up positions on the coast . On the same day , the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group airfield at Cerklje was again attacked by German aircraft . 
 As the activities of Natlačen and his NszS were continuing , the Yugoslav Supreme Command ordered their arrest . However , Rupnik and the head of the operations staff of the headquarters of the 1st Army Group , Pukovnik Franjo Nikolić , hid the orders from Petrović and did not carry them out . 
 = = = 10 April = = = 
 On the evening of 9 April , the commander of the German 2nd Army , Generaloberst Maximilian von Weichs , ordered the XLVI Motorised Corps to break out of its bridgeheads in the 4th Army 's sector the following day . The thrust from the Gyékényes bridgehead was to drive straight west to Zagreb then continue west to cut off the withdrawing 7th Army . This attack was led by the 14th Panzer Division , supported by dive bombers , and was a resounding success . By 19 : 30 on 10 April , lead elements of the 14th Panzer Division had reached the outskirts of Zagreb , having covered nearly 160 kilometres ( 99 miles ) in a single day . Before it arrived , the Ustaše , supported by German agents , had proclaimed the creation of the Independent State of Croatia ( Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska , NDH ) . By the time it entered Zagreb , the 14th Panzer Division was met by cheering crowds , and had captured 15 @,@ 000 Yugoslav troops , including 22 generals . 
 In the 7th Army sector , about 09 : 45 , the LI Infantry Corps began crossing the Drava , but construction of a bridge near Maribor was suspended because the river was in flood . Despite this , the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative crossing point , and established a bridgehead . This crossing point was a partially destroyed bridge , guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of Detachment Ormozki , the far left formation of the 4th Army . This crossing , combined with the withdrawal of the 38th Infantry Division Dravska from the line from Slovenska Bistrica to Ptuj exposed the left flank of Detachment Ormozki . The Detachment attempted to withdraw south , but began to disintegrate during the night of 10 / 11 April . 
 That same night , the 1st Mountain Division , the most capable formation of XLIX Mountain Corps , had de @-@ trained , crossed the border near Bleiburg , and advanced southeast towards Celje , reaching a point about 19 km ( 12 mi ) from the town by evening . The rest of the XLIX Mountain Corps encountered little resistance , and by nightfall had reached the line <unk> – <unk> . Luftwaffe reconnaissance sorties revealed that the main body of the 7th Army was withdrawing towards Zagreb , leaving behind light forces to maintain contact with the German bridgeheads . When it received this information , 2nd Army headquarters ordered LI Infantry Corps to form motorised columns to pursue the 7th Army south , but extreme weather conditions and flooding of the Drava at Maribor on 10 April slowed the German pursuit . 
 On 10 April , as the situation was becoming increasingly desperate throughout the country , Simović , who was both the Prime Minister and Chief of the General Staff , broadcast the following message : 
 All troops must engage the enemy wherever encountered and with every means at their disposal . Don 't wait for direct orders from above , but act on your own and be guided by your judgement , initiative , and conscience . 
 During the night of 10 / 11 April , XLIX Mountain Corps was ordered to bridge the Savinja river at Celje , then advance towards Brežice on the Sava , and LI Infantry Corps was directed to link up with the 14th Panzer Division which would then drive west to Karlovac . The Italians were expected to commence offensive action by attacking southwards to link up with the 14th Panzer Division in the vicinity of Karlovac . 
 = = = 11 April = = = 
 On 11 April , Ustaše elements captured the staff of the 7th Army at Topusko and handed them over to the Germans shortly thereafter , and the 7th Army effectively ceased to exist as a formation . Petrović and the staff of 1st Army Group headquarters were also captured by Ustaše at Petrinja . Chaos ensued throughout the 7th Army , whose Croat and Slovene soldiers could hear fifth column radio broadcasts telling them of their pending encirclement by the Germans and encouraging them to return to their homes and not fight against the Germans . This was reinforced by Natlačen and his NszS , who had distributed leaflets on the night of 10 / 11 April urging soldiers not to resist the Italians or Germans . To maintain public order , the NszS also formed a " Slovenian Legion " on 11 April , and encouraged Slovene nationalists among the 7th Army to join it . This force , split into a dozen units and totalling 2 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 000 men , then began to assist the Germans in disarming units of the Yugoslav Army on Slovene territory . The NszS authorised Natlačen to negotiate with the Germans for the creation of a Slovene client state along the lines of the NDH and the Slovak Republic , and Natlačen appointed the Ljubljana police chief <unk> <unk> to make contact with the Germans . 
 <unk> for the NszS approached Generalmajor Hubert Lanz , the commander of the 1st Mountain Division , when his formation approached Celje , but Lanz was not empowered to negotiate with civilians , and sought direction from higher headquarters . All German commanders were authorised to negotiate with the commanders of Yugoslav military formations so long as they agreed to surrender all weapons . Later that day , Lanz was authorised to meet with Natlačen the following day , and <unk> Mountain Corps took Celje . Held up by freezing weather and snow storms , LI Infantry Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north , and broke through a hastily established defensive line between <unk> and Krapina . Bicycle @-@ mounted troops of the 183rd Infantry Division turned east to secure Ustaše @-@ controlled Varaždin . In the evening , LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division but lead elements of that division had already thrust west from Zagreb into the rear of the withdrawing 7th Army and captured Karlovac . 
 Around 12 : 00 , the Italians went over to the offensive , with the 3rd Alpine Group tasked to advance to the line Selca – Radovljica , XI Corps to push via Logatec to Ljubljana , VI Corps to drive on <unk> , and V Corps to advance from Fiume towards Kraljevica and towards Lokve . While one Italian attack south of the <unk> plateau was stopped by elements of the Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski and the Italian advance was held up by border troops in some areas , there was little significant resistance , and by the end of the day they had captured Sušak , Bakar , Delnice , Jesenice , <unk> , Logatec and Ljubljana . To assist the Italian advance , the Luftwaffe attacked Yugoslav troops in the Ljubljana region , and the 14th Panzer Division , which had captured Zagreb on 10 April , drove west to encircle the withdrawing 7th Army . The Italians faced little resistance , and captured about 30 @,@ 000 troops of the 7th Army waiting to surrender near Delnice . When the Italian 14th Infantry Division Isonzo entered Ljubljana , a delegate of the NszS greeted its commander , Generale di Divisione Federico Romero , and symbolically handed him the keys to the city . An official reception was held for Romero that evening , attended by Natlačen and most of the members of the NszS , but because Natlačen and the council preferred that the Germans occupy Ljubljana , he asked Romero for permission to travel to Celje the following day to meet with Lanz . 
 = = Fate = = 
 On 12 April , the 14th Panzer Division linked up with the Italians at Vrbovsko , closing the ring around the remnants of the 7th Army , which promptly surrendered , and the 1st Mountain Division pushed through Novo Mesto and <unk> without facing resistance , reaching <unk> by the end of the day . At Celje , Lanz received a delegation led by Natlačen which included Andrej <unk> . The meeting was very formal and cold , as Lanz had already received orders regarding the break @-@ up of Slovenia into Italian and German @-@ controlled territories , and the council and its goal of an independent Slovenia were superfluous from a German perspective . 
 Remnants of the 4th Army conducted a fighting withdrawal through Bosnia towards Sarajevo over the following days , pursued by the 14th Panzer Division and elements of LI Infantry Corps but a ceasefire was declared at noon on 15 April . After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document , the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12 : 00 on 18 April . Yugoslavia was then occupied and dismembered by the Axis powers , with Germany , Italy , Hungary , Bulgaria and Albania all annexing parts of its territory .

He fought in André Masséna 's Army of Switzerland , where he participated in the Winterthur and First and Second Battles of Zürich , the campaigns of 1806 against Prussia , and Napoleon 's invasion of Russia . After the Russian and Saxon campaign , while suffering from exhaustion , he contracted typhus and died in <unk> , in the Saarland . He was buried at the Panthéon , and his name is listed on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris .

 Walther was the son of Georges Henri Walther , a Lutheran pastor , and Marie Elisabeth Chatel of Montbéliard . He was born in <unk> , in the Alsace region of the Bas @-@ Rhin . His cousins , Frédéric Cuvier and Georges Cuvier , were naturalists and zoologists . He married 20 @-@ year @-@ old Salome @-@ Louise Coulman on 12 April 1802 . They had two daughters , born 1803 and 1807 ; in 1810 , a third child was still @-@ born . 
 Initially he enlisted as a simple soldier in the <unk> Hussars . This unit was included in the 1791 reorganization , and became the 1st Regiment of Hussars . On 10 May 1792 , he received a commission as a lieutenant . 
 = = Military career = = 
 During the War of the First Coalition , he was active at the battle of Neerwinden and the campaign on the Piave River in northern Italy . During these campaigns , he proved equally adept at leading heavy or light cavalry , although some military analysts consider he was a better heavy cavalry leader . In 1793 , he was promoted to general of brigade . 
 In the War of the Second Coalition , he participated in the French defeats at Ostrach and Stockach in March 1799 , and served under the newly promoted Michel Ney on the forward line of defense of the Swiss city of Zürich . At the Battle of Winterthur , he directed the rear guard action covering Ney 's retreat through Winterthur , holding a key bridge cross of the <unk> River for 90 minutes against a larger Austrian force under command of Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze . 
 A few days later , he was present for the defeat at the First Battle of Zürich when André Masséna withdrew the entire French force across the Limmat river . In September 1799 , he was present at the Second Battle of Zürich when Masséna 's Army of Helvetia and Army of the Danube crushed Alexander Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's Russian force ; he actively harried the fleeing Russians . He later fought at the Battle of Messkirch in 1800 . 
 = = = Napoleonic Wars = = = 
 During the War of the Third Coalition , he participated in the Ulm Campaign , in which cavalry played an essential part . He participated in French victories at Hohenlinden and later at Austerlitz , where he commanded the 2nd Dragoon Division in Marshal Joachim Murat 's Cavalry Reserve . His division was a key to Soult 's successful attack on the Russian center . He suffered wounds at both these battles and after the latter , he received le Grand Aigle de la Légion d 'honneur ( Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor ) , and appointed Chamberlain to the Emperor . Subsequently , he was decorated as a Commander of the Order of the Iron Crown , and appointed as Colonel of the Grenadiers à Cheval ( mounted grenadiers ) , of the Imperial Guard , in 1806 , a position he held until his death 1813 . 
 At the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 , he led his dragoons in Murat 's famous 10 @,@ 000 @-@ man cavalry charge depicted by Jean Antoine Siméon Fort , the 19th century history painter . At the Battle of Wagram ( July 1809 ) Walther commanded four squadrons of Grenadiers à Cheval of Jean @-@ Baptiste Bessières 's Imperial Guard Cavalry . As the battle was turning to the Austrians ' favour , Bessières launched a massive cavalry charge with the combined elements of the Cavalry Reserve Corps and the cavalry of the Imperial Guard . After a first , precipitated charge , Bessières was wounded and incapacitated , and the whole cavalry attack was suspended . Napoleon then launched a major infantry attack with Jacques MacDonald 's infantry and considerable cavalry support , including the Guard cavalry under Walther . After the battle , MacDonald accused Walther of failure to mobilize his cavalrymen quickly enough and not charging when the time was right . Walther accompanied Napoleon to Russia as a commander of the light cavalry of the Imperial Guard , part of which rotated duties as Napoleon 's honor guard . 
 During the Saxon campaign of 1813 , Walther continued command of the Guard Cavalry , and was present at the Battle of Lützen and Battle of Dresden , as commander of the Guard cavalry . At the Battle of Teplitz ( 17 September 1813 ) , he commanded the Imperial Guard Cavalry including the dragoons , Grenadiers à Cheval , and 1st ( Polish ) and 2nd ( Dutch ) Lancers . At the Battle of Leipzig , he commanded the 3rd Division of the cavalry of the Imperial Guard : The total cavalry of the Guard included 7 @,@ 903 men and 18 guns . After refitting and resupply at Erfurt , where Napoleon had stashed a large depot of arms and ammunition , the French army continued to withdraw through western Germany , toward the Rhine . 
 The Battle of Hanau , 30 – 31 October 1813 , was Walther 's last major action . He commanded the 3rd Division of the Young Guard , including the four squadrons of mounted grenadiers , the Dragoons , the Chasseurs à Cheval , and the mounted Polish Lancers ; he also had charge of Napoleon 's honor guard of five squadrons , and two field artillery battalions . By this time , Walther was suffering from exhaustion . He collapsed and died in the night of 24 November 1813 , in <unk> . Sources differ on whether he died of exhaustion or typhus , or a combination of both . His body was transported first to the cathedral in Metz and from there to Paris , escorted by a detachment of the Imperial Guard . He was buried in the Pantheon . His name appears on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris .

 No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 1 EFTS ) was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) pilot training unit that operated during World War II . It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia 's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme . The unit was established in November 1939 as No. 2 Flying Training School at Melbourne , Victoria . It was relocated to Parafield , South Australia , in December 1939 and renamed No. 1 EFTS the following month . Training activities relocated to Tamworth , New South Wales , in May 1944 ; the school was disbanded in December that year . 
 = = History = = 
 Flying instruction in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War II , in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia 's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) . The Air Force 's pre @-@ war pilot training facility , No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria , was supplanted in 1940 – 41 by twelve elementary flying training schools ( EFTS ) and eight service flying training schools ( SFTS ) . The EFTS provided a twelve @-@ week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF 's initial training schools . Flying training was undertaken in two stages : the first involved four weeks of instruction ( including ten hours of flying ) to determine trainees ' suitability to become pilots . Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training ( including sixty @-@ five hours of flying ) at the EFTS . Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators . 
 No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School was formed as No. 2 Flying Training School in Melbourne on 6 November 1939 . Its inaugural commanding officer was Squadron Leader <unk> Wight . On 13 December , the school moved to Parafield , South Australia , after building work was completed there . Parafield was home to the South Australian Aero Club , and it was the airfield 's position as the hub of civilian flight instruction in the state that led to it becoming the base for the first flying school the RAAF raised during World War II . The same principle was followed in establishing No. 3 Flying Training School ( later renamed No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School ) at Archerfield , Queensland , No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School at Essendon , Victoria , and No. 4 Elementary Flying Training School at Mascot , New South Wales . 
 No. 2 Flying Training School 's first thirteen de Havilland Gipsy Moth training aircraft were delivered to Parafield on 16 – 17 December 1939 . The unit was renamed No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 1 EFTS ) on 2 January 1940 . The first eight @-@ week flying training course began on 8 January with twenty @-@ three students ; another joined a week later . According to the unit operations book , limited flying was possible owing to the number of available parachutes but , on 19 January , " permission was granted to continue training without them until supplies were forthcoming " . The second flying course began on 5 February . An instructor and his cadet were killed in a crash on 19 March . No. 1 EFTS 's complement of aircraft was augmented on 20 April with the arrival of six de Havilland Tiger Moths . 
 The school 's inaugural EATS course , consisting of twenty @-@ four students , commenced on 29 April 1940 ; all but one of the students graduated . Five more Tiger Moths arrived on 25 June . On 22 July , three aircraft belonging to the South Australian Aero Club were pressed into service , and training by the club ceased . No. 1 EFTS received three CAC Wackett Trainers on 26 June 1941 . On 2 August 1941 , control of the school was transferred from Southern Area Command , which had been formed in March 1940 , to the newly established No. 1 ( Training ) Group . As of December 1942 , No.1 EFTS had 116 students under instruction ; a total of 1 @,@ 184 trainees — 81 air cadets and 1 @,@ 043 EATS students — had passed through the school . A year later No.1 EFTS had eighty @-@ five students under instruction and a total of 1 @,@ 628 had passed through . 
 No. 1 EFTS relocated to Tamworth , New South Wales , during 17 – 28 May 1944 , reportedly to allow for the expansion of civil aviation at Parafield . Training units in New South Wales came under the control of No. 2 ( Training ) Group . On 10 September , a student was killed when his Tiger Moth crashed south of Tamworth aerodrome . All flying training at No. 1 EFTS came to an end on 15 September , by which time a total of 1 @,@ 991 students had passed through the school . Pilots still undergoing instruction were posted to No. 8 Elementary Flying School at <unk> , New South Wales , and No. 11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla , Victoria . The RAAF had ordered the school 's closure in August 1944 as part of a general reduction in aircrew training , after being informed by the British Air Ministry that it no longer required EATS graduates for the war in Europe . Significant reserves of trained Commonwealth aircrew had been built up in the UK early in 1944 prior to the invasion of Normandy , but lower @-@ than @-@ anticipated casualties had resulted in an over @-@ supply that by 30 June numbered 3 @,@ 000 Australians . No. 1 EFTS was officially disbanded on 12 December 1944 . Care and Maintenance Unit ( CMU ) Tamworth was formed the same day , utilising some of No. 1 EFTS 's staff . It was one of many <unk> that the RAAF raised for the storage and upkeep of surplus aircraft prior to their disposal after the war . CMU Tamworth was disbanded on 5 July 1947 .

 Director / writer Sooraj Barjatya noted that the story of Vivah is based upon a newspaper article his father read in 1988 . Like in all of Sooraj R. Barjatya 's previous films , the male lead is called Prem . The story combined elements of Hindu tradition to set itself up as a film of cultural significance and was constructed differently than Barjatya 's earlier films . Barjatya hoped that the film would be remembered as the first to tackle the definitions and dynamics of a marriage . In an interview with Times of India Barjatya said , he kept in mind all the novels of <unk> Chatterjee while making Vivah . Barjatya felt that the film should possess a lyrical feel , since it was , according to him , " a lyrics oriented film . " 
 Filming took place during the first months of 2006 . The main hurdle came up with the location . Barjatya wanted to shoot film in an authentic way . He asked the film 's art director Sanjay <unk> to create the entire town of Madhupur that can give a realistic look , particularly portions where water leaking takes place and portions where spit marks were visible on the walls of the buildings in the film . Later , the town was created in film city , Mumbai . Outdoor session of the film was done in Delhi , Lonavla , Ranikhet , Nainital and Almora . 
 Additional production credits include : Jay <unk> – dance choreographer , Sound — <unk> Chaudhary , Dialogue — <unk> Karan Atal , Cinematography — Harish Joshi and Editor — V N <unk> . Amrita Rao 's costumes were created by Indian designer Anna Singh and Shahid Kapoor 's clothes were created by Shabina Khan . To promote the film , Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao sold tickets at the Fame Theatre in Malad , Mumbai .

 The soundtrack ( songs and the background score ) and lyrics for Vivah was scored by Ravindra Jain . Vivah was seventh collaboration of Ravindra Jain with Rajshri Productions . It was produced under the Saregama label . The composer primarily gave special importance to " taal " and opted to keep two " <unk> " followed by a " <unk> " in the songs . The orchestra combines with classical Indian instruments , like the sitar , sarod , violin , dholak and tabla to produce a blend between classical western and classical Indian music . The complete film soundtrack album was released on 26 September 2006 . 
 The music has , however , been criticised due to its monotony choice of instruments and music arrangements being very similar to one another . Rediff.com wrote in its music review that , " Vivah 's music disappoints " . <unk> of Glamsham gave the album 2 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars and noted that , " The music of Vivah fails to emerge as successful as other Rajshri family potboilers , Maine Pyar Kiya , Hum Aapke Hain Koun [ sic ] and Hum <unk> @-@ <unk> Hain .

Ron Ahluwalia of Planet Bollywood gave it 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 wrote , " Sooraj <unk> comes up with the best , cheesiest family flick we ’ ve seen in a long time without sending us back to the 1940s . " Deepa <unk> of Sify said , " Vivah is far less offensive and far more watchable . " Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India called it a " simple documentation of something as banal as an engagement to a <unk> " . <unk> Das of The Telegraph criticised Vivah for lacking plot , flat characters and mentioning that the story was " rather weak and improbable . " BBC described Vivah as " a didactic , worthy , and highly sanitised take on reality in keeping with the Rajshri tradition . " Rajeev Masand of CNN @-@ IBN gave only 1 out of 5 stars and condemned the screenplay , calling both Kapoor and Rao " insipid and boring . " A review carried by Anupama Chopra mentioned , " Sooraj Barjatya 's fantasy world is carefully constructed , but his conviction infuses his films with an emotional heft .

The Regent , a theater in Patna , Bihar , put up a festive banner to promote the movie . The banner reads Poonam weds Prem . Vivah inspired couples at that time to emulate the protagonists . 
 = Edward Condon = 
 Edward Uhler Condon ( March 2 , 1902 – March 26 , 1974 ) was a distinguished American nuclear physicist , a pioneer in quantum mechanics , and a participant in the development of radar and nuclear weapons during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project . The Franck – Condon principle and the Slater – Condon rules are co @-@ named after him . 
 He was the director of the National Bureau of Standards ( now NIST ) from 1945 to 1951 . In 1946 , Condon was president of the American Physical Society , and in 1953 was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . 
 During the McCarthy period , when efforts were being made to root out communist sympathizers in the United States , Edward Condon was a target of the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee on the grounds that he was a ' follower ' of a ' new revolutionary movement ' , quantum mechanics ; Condon defended himself with a famous commitment to physics and science . 
 Condon became widely known in 1968 as principal author of the Condon Report , an official review funded by the United States Air Force that concluded that unidentified flying objects ( UFOs ) have prosaic explanations . The lunar crater Condon is named for him . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Edward Condon was born on March 2 , 1902 , in Alamogordo , New Mexico to William Edward Condon and Carolyn Uhler Condon . His father was supervising the construction of a narrow @-@ gauge railroad , many of which were built in the area by logging companies . After graduating from high school in Oakland , California in 1918 , he worked as a journalist for three years at the Oakland Inquirer and other papers . 
 He then attended the University of California , Berkeley , initially joining the College of Chemistry ; when he learned that his high school physics teacher had joined the faculty , he switched majors to take classes in theoretical physics . Condon earned his bachelor 's degree in three years and his doctorate in two . His Ph.D. thesis combined work by Raymond Thayer Birge on measuring and analyzing band spectral intensities and a suggestion by James Franck . 
 Thanks to a National Research Council fellowship , Condon studied at Göttingen under Max Born and at Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld . Under the latter , Condon rewrote his Ph.D. thesis using quantum mechanics , creating the Franck – Condon principle . After seeing an ad in Physical Review , Condon worked in public relations at Bell Telephone Laboratories in fall 1927 , in particular promoting their discovery of electron diffraction . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Condon taught briefly at Columbia University and was associate professor of physics at Princeton University from 1928 to 1937 , except for a year at the University of Minnesota . With Philip M. Morse , he wrote Quantum Mechanics , the first English @-@ language text on the subject in 1929 . With G.H. <unk> , he wrote the Theory of Atomic Spectra , " a bible on the subject from the moment of its 1935 publication " . 
 He was associate director of research at the Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh , beginning in 1937 , where he established research programs in nuclear physics , solid @-@ state physics , and mass spectroscopy . He then headed the company 's research on microwave radar development . He also worked on the equipment used to isolate uranium for use in atomic bombs . He served as a consultant to the National Defense Research Committee during World War II and helped organize MIT 's Radiation Laboratory . 
 In 1943 , Condon joined the Manhattan Project . Within six weeks , he resigned as a result of conflicts about security with General Leslie R. Groves , the project 's military leader . General Groves had objected when Condon 's superior J. Robert Oppenheimer held a discussion with the director of the project 's Metallurgical Lab at the University of Chicago . In his resignation letter , he explained : 
 The thing which upsets me the most is the extraordinary close security policy .... I do not feel qualified to question the wisdom of this since I am totally unaware of the extent of enemy espionage and sabotage activities . I only want to say that in my case I found that the extreme concern with security was morbidly <unk> the discussion about censoring mail and telephone calls . 
 From August 1943 to February 1945 , Condon worked as a part @-@ time consultant at Berkeley on the separation of U @-@ 235 and U @-@ 238 . Condon was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1944 . Following the war , Condon played a leading role in organizing scientists to lobby for civilian control of atomic energy rather than military control under strict security . He worked as science adviser to Senator Brien McMahon , chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy , which wrote the McMahon @-@ Douglas Act , enacted in August 1946 , that created the Atomic Energy Commission , placing atomic energy under civilian control . Adopting an internationalist viewpoint , Condon favored international scientific cooperation and joined the American @-@ Soviet Science Society . 
 = = Director of NIST = = 
 President Harry S. Truman nominated Condon to be director of the National Bureau of Standards ( now known as NIST ) in 1945 . He was confirmed by the Senate without opposition and served until 1951 . He was also president of the American Physical Society in 1946 . On May 29 , 1946 , FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover wrote a letter intended for President Truman that named several senior government officials as part of a Soviet network . It described Condon as " nothing more or less than an espionage agent in disguise . " Decades later Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan called it " baseless corridor talk " . The Truman administration ignored Hoover 's charges . 
 Over the next decade , Condon 's security clearance status was repeatedly questioned , reviewed , and re @-@ established . Congressman J. Parnell Thomas , head of the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) , furnished information to the Washington Times @-@ Herald that denigrated his loyalty in two articles published in March 1947 . Thomas had several reasons to make a prominent case of Condon . He had no sympathy for the scientific community 's international spirit in the first place and could use the ongoing controversy to argue for an increase in his committee 's appropriation , to bolster opposition to the Condon @-@ supported McMahon Act , and to attract favorable coverage during election season . The Department of Commerce cleared Condon of disloyalty charges on February 24 , 1948 . A HUAC report dated March 2 , 1948 said that " It appears that Dr. Condon is one of the weakest links in our atomic security " . Condon responded : " If it is true that I am one of the weakest links in atomic security that is very gratifying and the country can feel absolutely safe for I am completely reliable , loyal , conscientious and devoted to the interests of my country , as my whole life and career clearly reveal " . 
 Those who defended him included Albert Einstein and Harold Urey . The entire physics department of Harvard and numerous professional organizations wrote Truman on Condon 's behalf . The Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists held a dinner on April 12 , 1948 , to demonstrate support , with nine Nobel Prize winners among the sponsors . The National Academy of Sciences , by contrast , considered only a statement criticizing HUAC 's procedures rather than defending Condon . Despite widespread support among its members ( 275 to 35 ) , the National Academy of Sciences ' leadership did not release a statement , and instead opted to speak privately with Rep. Thomas . On July 15 , 1948 , the Atomic Energy Commission granted Condon a security clearance , allowing him to access classified information at NIST . 
 In September 1948 , at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) , President Truman , with Condon sitting nearby on the dais , denounced Rep. Thomas and HUAC on the grounds that vital scientific research " may be made impossible by the creation of an atmosphere in which no man feels safe against the public airing of unfounded rumors , gossip and vilification " . He called HUAC 's activities " the most un @-@ American thing we have to contend with today . It is the climate of a totalitarian country " . 
 Condon opposed any cooperation with Congressional attempts to identify security risks within the scientific community . In June 1949 , in a sharply critical letter to Oppenheimer , who had provided information to HUAC about a colleague , he wrote : " I have lost a good deal of sleep trying to figure out how you could have talked this way about a man whom you have known for so long , and of whom you know so well what a good physicist and good citizen he is . " In July 1949 , he testified before a Senate subcommittee that was considering rules governing the operation of Senate committees . He criticized Thomas and the HUAC for holding closed hearings and then leaking information that denigrated his loyalty and that of other scientists . He said that the committee denied his and his colleagues ' requests for public hearings so they could respond . 
 = = Continued attacks = = 
 With his record finally cleared in 1951 , Condon left government to become head of research and development for the Corning Glass Works . He said his $ 14 @,@ 000 annual government salary was his reason for the move . President Truman issued a statement of praise : " You have served in a most critical position with continued and loyal attention to your duties as director , and by reason of your standing among scientists and the supervision you have given to the bureau 's activities , you have made of it a more important agency than it has ever been before " . Two Republican Congressmen asserted that Condon was being investigated as a security risk and was leaving " under fire " , a charge the Secretary of Commerce Charles Sawyer denied . 
 On December 27 , 1951 , Condon was elected to head the AAAS in 1953 . In September 1952 , Condon , in testimony before a Congressional committee , had his first opportunity to deny under oath all charges of disloyalty that had been made against him . The HUAC concluded in its annual report for 1952 that Condon was unsuited for a security clearance because of his " propensity for associating with persons disloyal or of questionable loyalty and his contempt for necessary security regulations " . On December 30 , 1952 , Condon assumed the presidency of the AAAS at its annual meeting , where , according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , " The tremendous ovation by his fellow members accompanying his induction was a further affirmation of their faith in his loyalty and integrity " . 
 Five months later Condon 's clearance was revoked as was standard when someone left government service . He was granted a security clearance once more on July 12 , 1954 . It was announced on October 19 and then suspended by Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas on October 21 . Vice President Nixon took credit for the suspension , and the Atomic Scientists of Chicago charged " political abuse of the national security system " , though Secretary Thomas denied Nixon had played a role . Condon withdrew his application for clearance and in December resigned from Corning because the company was seeking government research contracts and he lacked the clearance necessary for participating in military research . After citing the security reviews he had passed over the years , he said : " I am unwilling to continue a potentially indefinite series of reviews and re @-@ reviews " . Corning had paid Condon 's clearance @-@ related legal expenses while he worked there . 
 In 1958 , Condon wrote that his decision reflected his belief that the Eisenhower administration " was committed by policy to the persecution of scientists , or , at the very least , to a callous indifference toward what others were doing to attack and discredit them . I decided the situation was hopeless , and that I had done all that could be reasonably expected of me in having resisted these forces for seven long years " . 
 Years later , Carl Sagan reported how Condon described one encounter with a loyalty review board . A board member stated his concern : " Dr. Condon , it says here that you have been at the forefront of a revolutionary movement in physics called ... quantum mechanics . It strikes this hearing that if you could be at the forefront of one revolutionary movement ... you could be at the forefront of another " . Condon said he replied : " I believe in Archimedes ' Principle , formulated in the third century B.C. I believe in Kepler 's laws of planetary motion , discovered in the seventeenth century . I believe in Newton 's laws .... " and continued with a catalog of scientists from earlier centuries , including the Bernoulli , Fourier , Ampère , Boltzmann , and Maxwell . He once said privately : " I join every organization that seems to have noble goals . I don 't ask whether it contains Communists " .

 Condon was professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis from 1956 to 1963 and then at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1963 , where he was also a fellow of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics , until retiring in 1970 . 
 From 1966 to 1968 , Condon directed Boulder 's UFO Project , known as the Condon Committee . He was chosen for his eminence and his lack of any stated position on UFOs . He later wrote that he agreed to head the project " on the basis of appeals to duty to do a needed public service " on the part of the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research . Its final report concluded that unidentified flying objects had prosaic explanations . It has been cited as a key factor in the generally low levels of interest in UFOs among mainstream scientists and academics . 
 Condon was also president of the American Institute of Physics and the American Association of Physics Teachers in 1964 . He was president of the Society for Social Responsibility in Science ( 1968 – 69 ) and was co @-@ chairman of the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy ( 1970 ) . He co @-@ edited the Handbook of Physics with Hugh <unk> of the University of Arizona . He received the Frederic Ives Medal awarded by the Optical Society in 1968 . On his retirement , his colleagues honored him with the publication of a Festschrift . 
 Condon died on March 26 , 1974 , in Boulder Colorado Community Hospital . Atomic Structure , which Condon wrote with <unk> <unk> , appeared several years later in 1980 . The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) gives an annual award named for Condon . The Condon Award recognizes distinguished achievements in written exposition in science and technology at NIST . The award was initiated in 1974 . The crater Condon on the Moon is named in his honor .

 = Kylie Platt = 
 Kylie Platt ( née Turner ) is a fictional character from the British soap opera Coronation Street , played by Paula Lane . She was introduced as Becky McDonald 's ( Katherine Kelly ) half @-@ sister , making her on @-@ screen debut on 26 August 2010 . Lane landed the role , with executive producer Phil Collinson describing her as a brilliant casting . He also revealed that Kylie would have " major storylines " during her first six months in the serial . Lane created her approach to her portrayal from her own past experiences whilst growing up . Lane impressed the producers and had her contract extended until July 2012 . 
 Kylie 's backstory includes growing up in a broken home , living below the poverty threshold , and weak relationships with her estranged mother and sister . Kylie is characterised through her " full on personality " and has a feisty attitude . She has often been described as a " gobby female " who wants a better life and ultimately she is driven by money . Kylie has a son , Max ( Harry McDermott ) , who was placed into foster care . She had the child at a young age and she was not ready for the responsibility . Becky helps Kylie retrieve custody of Max . In one of her first big storyline arcs , Kylie sells her son to Becky for £ 20 @,@ 000 . The storyline was branded controversial by media outlets and Lane found it hard to compress her emotions whilst filming the plot . Lane said Kylie 's sheer audacity was highlighted when she dared to blackmail her barren sister for more cash . 
 Kylie remained off @-@ screen for episodic blocks in her first six months . Producers devised a storyline to give her permanent residence on Coronation Street , when she was revealed as the fiancée of David Platt ( Jack P. Shepherd ) . The development was to offer viewers " something new " and both actors have praised their pairing as a positive move . The storyline played the resurgence of Kylie 's love of money . Kylie has also engaged in feuds with Gail and Tina McIntyre , played by ( Helen Worth ) and ( Michelle Keegan ) respectively . Gail 's attempt to sabotage her son 's wedding to Kylie proved unsuccessful . It was a change in direction for the character , with the lure of money insufficient for her to leave " someone she loves " . In February 2016 , Lane announced her decision to leave Coronation Street . She filmed her final scenes as Kylie in June 2016 and producers decided to kill off the character . Kylie was murdered by Clayton Hibbs ( Callum Harrison ) while trying to protect her friend Gemma Winter ( Dolly @-@ Rose Campbell ) in the episode broadcast on 15 July 2016 , Lane last appeared as Kylie on 20 July 2016 . 
 Kylie has been well received by most critics for her image as a " gobby chav " . The general reaction to her pairing with David has also been positive . However , the Daily Mail has criticised Kylie for her deceit and branded some of her material as " dull " . Lane won Best Newcomer at the 2011 National Television Awards for her portrayal . She also garnered other nominations in awards ceremonies oriented to magazines .

 Kylie was created as the " tearaway " half @-@ sister of established character Becky McDonald ( Katherine Kelly ) . Actress Paula Lane was cast in the role and immediately received praise from executive producer Phil Collinson who described her as " brilliant " . Lane has stated she draws inspiration from her own past , as an angle to portray Kylie . Lane 's first scenes aired on 26 August 2010 . Lane later signed a new contract with the serial , which was later extended and meant Kylie would stay into July 2012 . Lane was delighted because it gave her the chance to " go full throttle with the character . " 
 Kylie was initially described as having a " full on " personality , similar to Becky . She was also labelled a " firecracker " . Lane described her as a " messed up girl , dragged up by an alcoholic mother " . In her life she had to " fight for survival " . Lane has also expressed her admiration of Kylie 's " comedy " . She has also said Kylie is " quite witty " and amid confrontation is " quick off the mark and won 't let someone stamp her down . " Viewers of the serial later observed Kylie to be as evil as Tracy Barlow ( Kate Ford ) . Lane said that the comparison was taken too far because Kylie has not murdered anyone , although she acknowledged that Kylie comes across as evil . She also stated : " Kylie will be a thorn in Becky and Steve 's sides for a long time to come " . 
 Kylie and Becky 's characterisation and backstory are similar . Lane felt it was important to portray certain differences between the two . This was to prevent the audience becoming bored through repetition . This was done through Kylie making the opposite choice Becky would make . In April 2011 Lane further described her as " volatile " because " you never know what she 'll do next . " Kylie proved to be unpredictable . Lane admitted it was fun to play her because " It 's difficult to imagine how she will react to things . " Through her relationships she is shown to be a " chancer " who wants to have fun and has " the bottle for anything . " One of Kylie 's main motivations in life is money and she develops a taste for better things in life . Lane also predicted that Kylie would do anything " if the price was right . " Lane opined that everyone 's perception of Kylie is " she 's conniving and only out for what she can get . " Kylie gained such a reputation as a trouble @-@ maker that Lane was often asked by members of the public to behave herself . Lane describes Kylie 's redeeming qualities the fact she is " bright and she 's a <unk> . " 
 = = = Introduction and selling Max = = = 
 Upon her introduction , Kylie was described as being a big character in her first six months of storylines . When she arrives she ruins Becky and Steve McDonald 's ( Simon Gregson ) plans for adoption . Kylie and Becky violently clash over the incident , and Lane received bruising from filming the scenes . The scenes were so violent that they were toned down before transmission . Lane said that the fight was her favourite set of scenes for Kylie . Kelly described Kylie and Becky as having a love @-@ hate relationship , but at the time Becky " wants to kill her " . Lane also sees Kylie as a " mixed @-@ up girl " , stating that she feels sorry for her . Lane herself stated that Kylie loves her sister but " feels resentful " that Becky left home when Kylie was only eight . " Becky was like a mother to Kylie . " 
 It is then revealed that Kylie has a son , Max ( Harry McDermott ) , who is in foster care . Lane said that this happened because Kylie " was drinking with his dad and not looking after him " . Kylie loves Max but is too " young and naive " too cope with motherhood . Kylie snatches Max while on a visit ; Lane opined it was a spur of the moment decision , but " she couldn 't bear to lose him " . Becky helps Kylie regain custody of him . The " turning point " in the storyline was attributed to scenes in which Kylie stands up in court and vows to change . Lane said that they were " touching " scenes , which included a rare moment in which Kylie applauds Becky for being " a great sister " . Lane stated that when she gets Max back , Kylie takes advantage of Becky . In another storyline Kylie makes a pass at Steve . Gregson who plays him opined that in Kylie 's mind she thought " that fat bald guy wants a bit " . He also said that Steve was " extremely shocked " but was not interested . Steve decides not to say anything to Becky because he doesn 't trust Kylie and knows that she will take Max away from Becky . Gregson said that in Steve 's opinion " she 's been trouble from the start and he 's sure that 's not going to change . " 
 Kylie plays on the fact that Becky is desperate for a child and offers to sell Max to her . Gregson said that he felt it immoral to buy a child , but stressed " Kylie isn 't an ordinary mother – she only cares about herself . " He said that Steve believes Max would be better off with Steve and Becky . Steve is the first to take Kylie seriously ; Gregson believed this was because Kylie has " proved herself ruthless " and " not the best mum " . Lane defended Kylie 's actions because she did " love her son " , but she makes the money @-@ making scam because she is " immature and irresponsible " . Lane herself was so shocked by the storyline that it made her over @-@ emotional on set , to the point where she had to take breaks from filming scenes . After selling Max for twenty thousand pounds , Kylie travels abroad , but later reappears during the serial 's live episode . She demands more money , which Becky has to steal . 
 = = = Marriage to David Platt = = = 
 In late 2010 Jack P. Shepherd , who plays fellow character David Platt , revealed his desire for more scenes with Lane as he thought that they worked well together . In January 2011 it was announced that Kylie would marry David in a " shock storyline " . Revealing the news whilst interviewed on talk show Loose Women , Lane said that the pair would meet off @-@ screen in Tenerife . Though she had not read the scripts , Lane thought they would be " a really good combination " . Coronation Street publicity said it would make " exciting viewing " for fans . They further stated : " Kylie and David are trouble as individuals so the thought of the two of them getting together is a nightmare prospect for both their families [ ... ] there is no end to the trouble they will cause for everyone . " Lane also revealed that the storyline was implemented because there was no other plausible way for Kylie to return . They did not carry on with the scenario with Becky and Steve , because the viewers needed " something new " . Lane was happy with the direction of the storyline because it paved the way for more " explosive " material . Kylie was also tipped to be the one in control of the relationship . She also acknowledged that certain aspects of their relationship would mirror Becky and Steve 's relationship , in the sense that when Kylie is with David , a " loved up " nicer side to Kylie surfaces . 
 David 's mother Gail McIntyre ( Helen Worth ) is shocked to learn the identity of his mystery fiancée , and disapproves of Kylie . The pair repeatedly clash in scenes that serve as comic relief . Gail dislikes Kylie because she " knows her type " , and the fact that she is related to Becky does not bode well . Lane said that Gail 's reaction was understandable because Kylie is not the epitome of " the perfect daughter @-@ in @-@ law . " She added that because Gail is so possessive of David , " it doesn 't bode well for the future . " Shepherd added that they are " the match made in hell " and revealed that David lets her do as she pleases because he is in love with her . He later said that David appeared obsessed and shared the similar dynamic he had with previous girlfriend Tina McIntyre ( Michelle Keegan ) . He concluded : " I think he 's keener on her than she is on him . " David fools Kylie into believing he owns a salon . Lane explained " Kylie sees an opportunity for a better life , but not in a money @-@ grubbing , scheming way . She does love David , and she 's not doing anything wrong . " Kylie sees the situation as an " added bonus " . After Kylie finds out the truth , the pair come up with a plan to " <unk> " his grandmother Audrey Roberts ' ( Sue Nicholls ) salon off her . 
 Gail tries to use the fact that Kylie gave Max up against her . Lane revealed that it did not work because Kylie revealed her past hardships and gained sympathy from David . The scenes also offered viewers the chance to gain a better perspective on who Kylie is and learn about her past . The night before their wedding , Gail unsuccessfully tries to pay Kylie one thousand pounds to leave for good . Lane said that Kylie had the audacity to come back after " £ <unk> for Max " so " £ 1000 to give up a salon and someone she loves is nothing " , though she still keeps the money . Up until this point Kylie had been " playing the game with Gail " , but she was not on " Kylie 's radar " . Kylie then realises how determined Gail is to ruin her wedding . Lane said " Gail has taken a pretty intense disliking to Kylie , so of course Kylie is going to fight her corner - that 's the kind of girl she is . " 
 When the pair marry , Lane described them as still being on the " honeymoon period " , equating to more lust than love . She opined that the serial had developed a " lovely relationship " which had " explosive chemistry " . David decides Kylie should have Max back . Lane explained that it was not the right time because Kylie still wasn 't ready for responsibility . Kylie " doesn 't want to mess with the little boy 's head anymore " and accepts he is safe with Becky . However David is " inquisitive " about the situation , but Kylie " brushes over " the hurt she really feels . 
 = = = Affair with Nick Tilsley = = = 
 Producers created an infidelity story for the character which involved David 's half @-@ brother Nick Tilsley ( Ben Price ) . David discovers the truth but decides not to let Kylie know . Shepherd told Alison Gardner from What 's on TV that David thinks if he confronts Kylie their relationship will end . He has to decide who should be punished for the affair . He decides that Nick is too blame and if he is too get revenge on him then Kylie must remain oblivious . He then contemplates committing suicide and then vandalises Nick 's flat . The actor concluded that David could forgive Kylie for her infidelity . 
 David begins by sending poison pen letters to Nick 's wife Leanne Battersby ( Jane Danson ) , which state that Nick is having an affair . Nick realises David is behind the letters . Price told Kilkelly ( Digital Spy ) his character panics and becomes annoyed . Nick is arrogant to his actions and believes David will just forgive him because they are related . He then tells David that they should discuss the affair with Kylie and move on . Price explained that David is worried that Kylie will feel betrayed he knew all along and does not want her to leave him . He decides he must stop Nick and grabs the steering wheel and causes a car crash . Price believed David was not trying to murder Nick , just prevent him from contacting Kylie . 
 Kylie begins to suspect that David intentionally caused the crash out of revenge . Kylie gain evidence and confronts David over his scheming at Lily 's christening . <unk> <unk> of The Guardian observed that " David 's family went on to pronounce him wicked and cast him out into darkness . " Writers kept the paternity of Kylie 's baby a secret up until birth . On @-@ screen the child , named Lily , has a paternity test taken in which it is revealed that David is her biological father . David then boasts about the result to Nick to cause further trouble . Producer Stuart Blackburn said that he used the story to " push Kylie to the edge " . It also created the opportunity for writers to revisit David 's bad persona . He said the revelation damages their relationship but his team were keeping the possibility of the pair reuniting . Kylie is angry at herself and David . Blackburn explained " in her head she 's a screw @-@ up , and she 'll be furious with herself for imagining she could ever have a normal life .

 In June 2014 , Lane announced that she was pregnant and Kylie would be written out of the show while the actress took maternity leave . Coronation Street producer Stuart Blackburn met with Lane and devised an exit storyline .

 To prepare for the storyline Lane discussed her character 's backstory with directors . She recalled that Kylie had previously suffered addiction which adds to the drama . Writers devised " heavy scripts " for Lane and she had to thoroughly research the issue . Lane hoped the story would raise awareness and also convey that ADHD is not a disease . After the story was broadcast , Lane has explained that Kylie blamed herself for Max 's ADHD . She believes her past actions have contributed to his behavioural issues and she refuses to listen to reassurance from her family . The actress blamed Kylie 's " very low self @-@ esteem " as a mother and she thinks other residents are judging her . Kylie becomes stressed with managing Max 's condition and looking after Lily . She wants to feel calm after working herself into a " tired and frustrated " state . She takes his medication thinking it will calm her down but she regrets her actions . 
 Kylie locates Max 's father Callum Logan ( Sean Ward ) to find answers about his ADHD . She finds it exciting revisiting her old neighbourhood . After the Platt family block her access to Max 's medication , Kylie buys amphetamine from Callum . Lane told Kilkelly that the drug gives her a similar effect and she is after a quick drug fix following withdrawals from Max 's medication . Off @-@ screen , the actress met with a recovering drug addict and discussed the mental and psychological effects of amphetamine addition , which aided her portrayal of Kylie 's struggle .

He makes it clear he is not interested in Max and just wants Kylie . Lane described Callum as having " a very dark presence " in Kylie 's life . 
 Lane 's temporary departure scenes aired on Christmas Day 2014 . The festive episode included David witnessing Callum trying to give Kylie drugs . He is furious and throws her out of their home . She decides to leave the area and her family . Blackburn then announced that upon the character 's return she would need to change her ways . He explained that the consequences of Kylie 's drug taking cause a custody battle for Max between David and Callum . The producer added " she 's going to have to get her act together , she really is . " Lane returned to filming as Kylie in April 2015 .

Sarah becomes hysterical , David stays calm and scheming , whereas Kylie remained in a state of shock and she had to " strip [ her performance ] right back " . The story played out with David attempting to help Sarah and Kylie move on . As Lane noted , the characters turn on each other and " it just becomes one big crazy fight for survival , it 's a mess . " They feel trapped with in the secret and the situation get out of control .

But when they argue with Gemma , they fear she will uncover the truth behind Callum 's death . 
 The show planned a dramatic stunt which would lead to the discovery of Callum 's body . The scene featured Carla Connor ( Alison King ) causing a car accident , colliding with Tyrone Dobbs ' ( Alan Halsall ) pick @-@ up truck which smashes into the Platt 's home . This causes the floor to give way and a recovery team unearthing Callum 's body . Producers decided to conclude the story without Kylie being held accountable for the murder . Instead they used a character that had been recently killed off , Tony Stewart ( Terence Maynard ) , who had publicly feuded with Callum . When Sarah confesses the truth to Todd Grimshaw ( Bruno Langley ) , he decides to frame Tony for the crime - a scheme which proved successful .

 = The Altar and the Door = 
 The Altar and the Door is the third studio album by American Christian rock band Casting Crowns , released on August 28 , 2007 on Beach Street Records and Reunion Records . Produced by Mark A. Miller , the album was inspired by lead singer Mark Hall 's experience looking at the MySpace pages of his youth ministry students . The album 's main theme is the difference between how Christians feel in church and the compromises they make outside of it . Its musical tone , which Hall says is different and more progressive , incorporates more of a rock sound than their previous , more polished studio efforts . 
 The Altar and the Door received positive to mixed reviews from critics upon its release . Particular praise was given to the lyrics and the album 's overall concept , but some critics felt the album 's sound was mediocre and uninventive . The album received the award for Pop / Contemporary Album of the Year at the 39th GMA Dove Awards . It sold 129 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , a record for a Christian album with no secular media support , enabling a debut at number one on the Billboard Christian Albums chart and number two on the Billboard 200 and Digital Albums charts , only blocked on the latter charts by the soundtrack for High School Musical 2 . It later topped the Catalog Albums chart in 2010 . The 18th best @-@ selling Christian album of the 2000s , The Altar and the Door has sold 1 @.@ 2 million copies and has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . The lead single from The Altar and the Door , " East to West " , was one of the most successful Christian singles of the 2000s , spending a total of 19 weeks atop the Billboard Christian Songs chart and peaking at twenty @-@ five on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart . While not as successful as " East to West " , follow @-@ up singles " Every Man " and " Slow Fade " were both top five hits on the Christian Songs chart .

 The main ideas for The Altar and the Door were inspired roughly eighteen months before the album 's release . Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co @-@ youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace . According to Hall , “ It wasn ’ t any major surprise , but we did see a lot of kids who had two worlds going on . MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain , this place you can go and not think anyone ’ s ever going to find out . Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are . They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page . The temptation was to just get upset and think that ’ s terrible . But MySpace isn ’ t really a big problem – it ’ s just revealing what the problem is " . He noted that this situation isn 't unique to teenagers and that while at church " we [ Christians ] want to serve [ God ] " but when " we get out there in the world ... it ’ s just different . We want to be accepted ; we want friends . The compromises start coming in small little increments until you ’ re just kind of out there . Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord . It ’ s a nasty place to live , and we all live there " . Hall says that " When we ’ re at the altar , everything ’ s clear , and it all makes perfect sense , and we know how to live . We know what ’ s right and what ’ s wrong . The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door ... That ’ s the problem ; we ’ re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle " . Hall elaborated in a separate interview that " Somewhere between the altar and the door , it all leaks out and I 'm out here wondering what to do , rationalising things instead of living the life that 's in me . So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths ( that are ) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet . The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that " . Although Hall says that he " always think [ s ] lyrics first " , he felt that " Once we [ Casting Crowns ] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different , a more progressive approach to the music . These songs sounded different in my head ; they 've been a big challenge for us as a band . And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project " . 
 The Altar and the Door was produced by Mark A. Miller . Most of the recording and all of the mixing for the album was done by Sam Hewitt at Zoo Studio in Franklin , Tennessee and My Refuge Studio in McDonough , Georgia ; additional recording was done by Michael Hewitt and Dale Oliver at those same locations . The strings on The Altar and the Door were arranged by Bernie Herms and recorded by Bill Whittington and Steve Beers at The Sound Kitchen in Franklin , Tennessee . The album was mastered by Richard Dodd . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Musically , The Altar and the Door has more influence from rock as compared to the group 's earlier efforts , which had influences from AC and pop . The album 's sound has been characterized as " flatter , rougher pop / rock " than the band 's previous , more polished efforts . The album mixes up @-@ tempo , guitar driven songs with " anthemic , arms in the air tracks " . " What This World Needs " demonstrates influences from rock music while the title track is driven by guitar . Tracks such as " The Word is Alive " and " Somewhere in the Middle " , the latter driven by piano , have a " huge " , anthemic sound . Ballads on the album include " Slow Fade " and " I Know You 're There " . 
 Lyrically , The Altar and the Door deals with Christian themes . " Slow Fade " deals with how moments of compromise and mistakes can lead to a " downward spiritual spiral " ; it urges listeners to make the right choices . " East to West " is about forgiveness and the skepticism with which humans accept it . " What This World Needs " calls the Christian church out for making Jesus ' message confusing by adding stuff to it ; it also looks at the current state of society . " Prayer for a Friend " is a " simple " song of intercession .

 The Altar and the Door received positive to mixed reviews upon its release . Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave it four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars , saying it has a " slightly greater dose of rock " and " Casting Crowns gave fans no reason to be disappointed on Alter [ sic ] " . Deborah Evans @-@ Price of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars , commenting that " With this new set , [ Mark ] Hall and his companions again deliver songs that are musically engaging and lyrically insightful ... Few acts more eloquently capture the complexities of being a Christian in today ’ s tumultuous world , but these fine folks continue to help light the path for the rest of us " . Jennifer E. Jones of <unk> gave it four out of five spins , opining that " There ’ s a reason why Casting Crowns is one of the best Christian bands out today , and that reason is evident when you listen to The Altar and The Door . After three albums , lead singer / songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot ... The Altar and The Door leaves plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus " . Mark Lawrence of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares , saying " Traditionally album number three is a defining point in a band 's legacy : some bands self implode and produce an album high on production sheen but low on song quality ... other bands though go on to produce their masterpiece ... The Altar and the Door leans closer to the masterpiece than the flop but leaves you with a sense that they have even greater things to come ... The Altar And The Door ' is clearly a Casting Crowns album in sound , content and style but this is far from being a negative thing and will appeal to both existing fans as well as draw in new ones " . Brian Mansfield gave it two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of four stars , commenting that " [ Casting Crowns ] concern themselves with the space between the title ’ s two fixtures – that is , between intention and action , between doing good and getting in the way , or , as one song puts it , between “ the God we want and the God who is . ” That ’ s a space worth exploring , and the band ’ s motives may be the best , but their anthems are as predictable as a televangelist ’ s tears : start soft , build big , then cue the strings " . 
 Andree Farias of Christianity Today gave the album a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars , Farias praised Mark Hall 's lyrical style and the album 's lyrical concept and themes , but he criticized the music as being " meandering melodies and an all @-@ too @-@ solemn disposition " and said " core fans will undoubtedly support this album , but those expecting the vitality and radio @-@ friendliness of the band 's previous releases will find it a relatively challenging listening experience " . Justin Mabee of Jesus Freak Hideout gave it two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars , calling the lyrical content " slightly better [ than the band 's previous works ] " but deriding the music as " more of the same " . 
 At the 39th GMA Dove Awards , The Altar and the Door received the award for Pop / Contemporary Album of the Year .
