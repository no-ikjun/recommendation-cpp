 General Krueger was gravely concerned about the seriousness of the situation on Los Negros . In response to urgent request from General Chase , Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for the movement of the rest of the 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited . At Krueger 's request , the 2nd Squadron , 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs . Other units would arrive on 6 and 9 March instead of 9 and 16 March . Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division , but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros . In order to use them , and to permit a shore @-@ to @-@ shore operation against Manus from Los Negros , Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up . 
 From the Japanese perspective , the battle was not going too well either . The Japanese had expected a landing on Seeadler Harbour , this being the logical American objective , and had concentrated their forces around the Lorengau airfield . The defence of the Momote airstrip and Hyane harbour was the responsibility of Baba Force , built around Captain Baba 's 1st Battalion , 229th Infantry Regiment . Colonel Ezaki ordered Baba to attack the beachhead but a suspicion the Hyane Harbour landing was a diversion , coupled with false reports of enemy activity at Salami had him retain the 2nd ( Iwakami ) Battalion of the 1st Independent Infantry Regiment there instead of sending it to assist Baba Force . By 2 March , Ezaki had resolved to attack the Hyane beachhead with his whole force . The difficulties imposed by the terrain , and disruption by American artillery and Allied naval gunfire , forced a postponement of the attack to the night of 3 March . 
 At 21 : 00 , a lone Japanese plane dropped eight bombs , cutting telephone wires . Once it had departed , yellow flares went up and a Japanese infantry attack was launched , supported by mortar fire . Offshore , Dechaineux ' destroyers came under attack from four Betty bombers . 1st Squadron , 5th Cavalry , was attacked by about two reinforced platoons , which were met by heavy automatic weapons and mortar fire . The heavy jungle in this sector permitted some infiltration but the Japanese force was not strong enough to overrun the position . The main Japanese attack was delivered by 2nd Battalion , 1st Independent Mixed Regiment , from the direction of the native skidway , together with detachments from the Porlaka area , and fell on 2nd Squadron , 5th Cavalry . The troopers noticed a change in Japanese tactics . Instead of infiltrating silently , they advanced across the open , talking and in some cases singing . Their advance took them straight into anti @-@ personnel mines and booby traps , which duly exploded , and then into the fields of fire of the Americans ' automatic weapons , including several .30 water @-@ cooled Browning machineguns , but the advance continued . The guns of the 211th Coast Artillery ( AA ) Battalion and 99th Field Artillery Battalion fired through the night , attempting to break up the Japanese attack from Porlaka . Shortly after midnight , Japanese barges attempted to cross Hyane harbour but were engaged by anti @-@ aircraft guns and did not reach the American positions . A Bofors 40 mm gun position was captured by the Japanese , who in turn were driven off by the Seabees . Manning the <unk> , the 5th Cavalry 's gunners piled up the Japanese dead until the guns had to be moved to get clear fields of fire . One of the Browning guns that held the position was later left in its place , as a monument . Sergeant Troy McGill occupied a revetment with his squad of eight men . All were killed or wounded except McGill and another man , whom he ordered to fall back to the next revetment . McGill fired his rifle until it jammed , then clubbed the Japanese with it until he was killed . He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor . 
 By dawn , the Japanese attack had subsided . Over 750 Japanese dead were counted in and around the American positions . No prisoners were taken . American casualties were 61 dead , and 244 wounded , including nine dead and 38 wounded Seabees . The 2nd Squadron , 5th Cavalry and the 40th Naval Construction Battalion received Presidential Unit Citations . General Chase called for an airdrop of ammunition , prodigious quantities of which had been expended during the night , and had Warramunga fire on the native skidway . 
 = = = Securing Seeadler Harbour = = = 
 The morning of 4 March saw the arrival of the 2nd Squadron , 7th Cavalry , which relieved the 2nd Squadron , 5th Cavalry . The next day Major General Innis P. Swift , the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division , arrived aboard Bush and assumed command . He ordered the 2nd Squadron , 7th Cavalry to attack across the native skidway . The 2nd Squadron , 5th Cavalry therefore went back into the line to relieve them . While the relief was taking place , the Japanese launched a daylight attack . This was repulsed by the cavalrymen , with the help of artillery and mortar fire , but the American attack was delayed until late afternoon . It then ran into a Japanese minefield and by dawn the advance had only reached as far as the skidway . 
 On the morning of 6 March , another convoy arrived at Hyane Harbour : five LSTs , each towing an LCM , with the 12th Cavalry and other units and equipment including five Landing Vehicles Tracked ( LVTs ) of the 592nd EBSR , three M3 light tanks of the 603rd Tank Company , and twelve 105mm howitzers of the 271st Field Artillery Battalion . The 12th Cavalry was ordered to follow the 2nd Squadron , 7th Cavalry in its advance to the north , and to capture the Salami Plantation . The road to Salami was little more than a muddy track in which vehicles soon became bogged . The Japanese also obstructed the route with ditches , felled trees , snipers , and booby traps . WO2 R. J. Booker of ANGAU used his local knowledge to guide the 12th Cavalry and the three tanks to Salami . Here the Japanese put up a fierce fight that lasted over an hour . The tanks fired canister shot shells into buildings and high @-@ explosive shells into the slits of Japanese bunkers . 
 The inhabitants of the area informed the ANGAU detachment the Japanese had retreated across Seeadler Harbour to Papitalai Mission . This , therefore , became the next objective . The 5th Cavalry would attack Papitalai Plantation from the east while the 2nd Squadron , 12th Cavalry would attack Papitalai Mission . The 5th Cavalry captured Porlaka without opposition and crossed <unk> Creek in canvas and rubber boats . A patrol under Captain William C. Cornelius fought an estimated 50 Japanese , who ultimately withdrew . Captain Cornelius , who was credited with killing four , was severely wounded and died the next day . He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross . 
 Because of the coral reef , conventional landing craft could not be used for the landing at Papitalai Mission . The five LVTs , one a combat type and the other four cargo @-@ carrying , set out from Hyane Harbour to Salami Plantation but the road was so bad that only the combat and one cargo LVT were available in time . The attack went ahead anyway , preceded by an airstrike and artillery bombardment by the 271st Field Artillery Battalion . The combat LVT fired 24 M8 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch rockets . Return fire was received from Japanese mortars and machine guns , and a 75mm howitzer . The first wave had to hold alone in the face of fire from Japanese bunkers for 45 minutes until the LVTs returned with the next wave . Later , they fought off a counterattack by about 30 Japanese . Joined by a third LVT which had eventually managed to make it to Salami , the LVTs made 16 trips across the harbour before nightfall curtailed operations , transporting part of the 2nd Squadron , 12th Cavalry , along with rations , water and ammunition , and evacuating the dead and wounded . 
 Colonel Ezaki reported the American attack on Papitalai Mission to the Eighth Area Army in Rabaul , promising a night counterattack on the position ; but no attack was delivered . The Japanese withdrew , and no further messages were ever received from Colonel Ezaki . 
 The task of silencing the Japanese guns guarding Seeadler Harbour fell to Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley 's Task Force 74 ( <unk> ) , consisting of the heavy cruiser HMAS Shropshire , light cruisers USS Phoenix and Nashville , and destroyers USS Bache , Beale , Daly , and Hutchins . They bombarded Hauwei Island for an hour on 4 March but on 6 March USS Nicholson was struck by a Japanese shell fired from Hauwei . With minesweepers scheduled to attempt to enter Seeadler Harbour again on 8 March , Admiral Kinkaid ordered Crutchley to try again . On the afternoon of 7 March , <unk> bombarded Hauwei , Ndrilo , <unk> , Pityilu and northern Los Negros . Shropshire fired 64 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and 92 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) shells , while the American cruisers and destroyers expended 1 @,@ 144 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) and 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) shells . The next day , two destroyers , two minesweepers , an LCM ( flak ) and six LCMs carrying trucks and supplies entered the Seeadler Harbour without being fired upon . This cleared the way for the 2nd Brigade , 1st Cavalry Division to land at Salmi on 9 March . 
 By 7 March , the Seabees had the Momote airfield ready . Artillery spotting aircraft began operating from the strip on 6 March and a B @-@ 25 made an emergency landing the next day . Guided by a B @-@ 25 , twelve P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron RAAF arrived from Kiriwina via Finschhafen on 9 March , the remaining twelve aircraft of the squadron following the next day . They were joined by the ground crew of No. 77 Squadron RAAF , which had arrived by LST on 6 March . The rest of No. 73 Wing RAAF arrived over the next two weeks , including the Kittyhawks of No. 77 Squadron RAAF and Supermarine Spitfires of No. 79 Squadron RAAF . Operations began on 10 March and henceforth ships and ground units in the Admiralties had air support just minutes away . 
 The ANGAU Detachment reached the town of Mokerang on 9 March and found fifty inhabitants . The Detachment was relieved to find islanders had not been deliberately ill @-@ treated by the Japanese . The retreating Japanese had stripped their gardens of food , leaving the civilian population hungry , so ANGAU arranged for them to be provisioned by the Americans .

 = = = Hauwei = = = 
 Operations on Los Negros had now reached the mopping @-@ up stage , but an estimated 2 @,@ 700 Japanese troops remained on Manus . General Swift decided to land Brigadier General Verne D. Mudge 's 2nd Brigade at Lugos Mission , west of Lorengau . Lorengau , known to be heavily fortified , was an important objective . It had an airfield , and four roads converged there . As a preliminary , the 302nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop was ordered to locate sites from which the artillery could cover landings on Manus . Three patrols were sent out by LCVP on 11 March . The first found Bear Point on Manus free of Japanese but lacking sites for artillery emplacements . The second scouted the Butjo Luo Islands . They found the islands apparently unoccupied , with good sites on the northern island . The third patrol , 25 officers and men of the 302nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop , two officers from the 99th Field Artillery Battalion , with WO2 A. L. Robinson of ANGAU and Kaihu , a native of Mokerang , as guides , set out for Hauwei in an LCVP , escorted by PT 329 , one of the PT boats now operating from the tender USS Oyster Bay in Seeadler Harbour . 
 As the patrol moved ashore , Major Carter S. <unk> spotted a well camouflaged bunker and threw two hand grenades into it . When they exploded , concealed Japanese mortars and machine guns commenced firing on the patrol and the craft offshore . The PT was hit , her commander wounded , and she withdrew . The LCVP headed toward the shore where it picked up five men , including Robinson and Kaihu . The LCVP retracted and headed out to sea but then sighted another group on the beach . She headed back in to pick them up , despite her commander being wounded , and succeeded . As she backed off the beach again , she was holed by a mortar round and began taking on water . Meanwhile , the damaged PT had reported what had happened and a bomber was sent to investigate . Flying low , it spotted the men in the water , and another PT boat was sent to the rescue , covered by the destroyer HMAS Arunta . After three hours in the water , the LCVP 's survivors were picked up by the PT boat . Eight Americans , including Major <unk> , had been killed and fifteen wounded , including the entire LCVP crew . Kaihu was missing and Robinson was contemplating how he would break the news to his family when Kaihu walked in , having swum back to Los Negros . 
 General Swift postponed the landing on Lugos and ordered the 2nd Squadron , 7th Cavalry to capture Hauwei . Once again , Robinson acted as guide , notwithstanding severe sunburn from his time in the water the previous day . The landing was covered by the destroyers Arunta , Bush , Stockton and Thorn ; a pair of rocket @-@ firing LCVPs and the LCM ( flak ) , which fired 168 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 114 mm ) rockets ; the guns of the 61st Field Artillery Battalion on Los Negros ; and six Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron dropped 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bombs . The assault was made from three cargo @-@ carrying LVTs . To save wear and tear , they were towed across Seeadler Harbour by LCMs and cut loose for the final run in to shore . The cavalrymen found well constructed and sited bunkers with interlocking fields of fire covering all approaches , and deadly accurate snipers . The next morning an LCM brought over a medium tank , for which the Japanese had no answer , and the cavalrymen were able to overcome the defenders at a cost of eight killed and 46 wounded ; 43 dead Japanese naval personnel were counted . The 61st and 271st Field Artillery Battalions moved to Hauwei , while the 99th established itself on Butjo <unk> . 
 = = = Lorengau = = = 
 The attack on Manus got underway on 15 March . Before dawn , two troops of the 8th Cavalry , six cargo carrying LVTs and the combat LVT were loaded on board an LST for the 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) trip across Seeadler Harbour from Salami . Beaches at Lugos , about 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) west of Lorengau were chosen in preference to those nearer Lorengau , which were known to be heavily defended . The destroyers Gillespie , Hobby , Kalk and Reid bombarded the area with their 5 inch guns ; the two rocket LCVPs , the LCM ( flak ) and the combat LVT raked the shoreline with rockets ; the artillery on Hauwei and Butjo Luo engaged targets ; and 18 B @-@ 25s of the 499th and 500th Bombardment Squadrons dropped 81 500 @-@ pound ( 227 kg ) bombs and strafed the area . 
 The Japanese had evidently not expected a landing at Lugos and their positions there were quickly overrun . The 1st Squadron , 8th Cavalry then advanced eastward until it was stopped by a Japanese bunker complex on the edge of the Lorengau airstrip . An artillery barrage was brought down , followed by an airstrike by Kittyhawks with 500 pound bombs . The cavalry resumed their advance and occupied a ridge overlooking the airstrip without opposition . In the meantime , the 7th Cavalry had been landed at Lugos from the LST on its second trip and took over the defense of the area , freeing the 2nd Squadron , 8th Cavalry to join the attack on Lorengau . The first attempt to capture the airstrip was checked by an enemy bunker complex . A second attempt on 17 March , reinforced by the 1st Squadron , 7th Cavalry and tanks , made good progress . The advance then resumed , with Lorengau itself falling on 18 March . 
 Although there had been plenty of fighting , the main Japanese force on Manus had not been located . Advancing inland towards Rossum , the 7th Cavalry found it on 20 March . Six days of fighting around Rossum were required before the 7th and 8th Cavalry reduced the entrenched Japanese positions there . The Japanese bunkers , actually log and earth pillboxes , proved resistant to artillery fire . 
 = = = Outlying islands = = = 
 As the Japanese on Los Negros ran out of food and ammunition , the fight became increasingly unequal . A last stand by fifty Japanese in the Papitalai Hills on 24 March marked the end of organised Japanese resistance on Los Negros . The end of organised resistance on Los Negros and Manus still left a number of islands in Japanese hands . To minimise civilian casualties , ANGAU quietly evacuated these islands in advance of the American operations . Pityilu was believed occupied by about 60 Japanese . On 30 March the 1st Squadron , 7th Cavalry was transported there from Lorengau by 10 LCMs towing seven LVTs . With the lessons of Hauwei in mind , the landing was covered by bombardment by destroyers , artillery , and two Landing Craft Support , plus an air strike by Kittyhawks and Spitfires . The landing was unopposed , but a strong Japanese position was encountered which was overcome with the aid of artillery and tanks . Some 59 Japanese were killed compared with eight Americans killed and six wounded . 
 The same treatment was given to Ndrilo and <unk> on 1 April but the 1st Squadron , 12th Cavalry found them unoccupied . This was notable for being the only amphibious operation of the war carried out by the United States in dugout canoes . The final landing was on <unk> on 3 April by the 2nd Squadron , 12th Cavalry . This time , six LCMs and six LCVPs were used instead of the LVTs . As a result , the first waves grounded on a reef and troopers had to wade ashore through the surf . Fortunately for them , there was no opposition . The Japanese , hiding in the interior , were eventually located by ANGAU and 30 Japanese were killed and five captured . Patrols continued hunting for Japanese throughout the islands . Increasingly , the cavalry followed up sightings reported by the natives . On Los Negros , the 302nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop killed 48 and captured 15 Japanese during May . On Manus , some 586 Japanese dead were counted and 47 prisoners taken . General Krueger officially declared the campaign over on 18 May .

 A diary found on a dead Japanese soldier recounted his last days : 
 28 March . Last night 's duty was rather quiet except for the occasional mortar and rifle fire that could be heard . According to the conference of the various unit leaders , it has been decided to abandon the present position and withdraw . The preparation for this has been made . However , it seems as though this has been cancelled and we will firmly hold this position . Ah ! This is honorable defeat and I suppose we must be proud of the way we have handled ourselves . Only our names will remain , and this is something I don 't altogether like . Yes , the lives of those remaining , 300 of us , are now limited to a few days . 
 30 March . This is the eighth day since we began the withdrawal . We have been wandering around and around the mountain roads because of the enemy . We have not yet arrived at our destination but we have completely exhausted our rations . Our bodies are becoming weaker and weaker , and this hunger is getting <unk> March . Although we are completely out of rations , the march continues . When will we reach Lorengau ? Or will this unit be annihilated in the mountains ? As we go along , we throw away our equipment and weapons one by <unk> April . Arrived at native shack . According to a communication , friendly troops in Lorengau cannot help but withdraw . Hereafter there is no choice but to live as the natives do .

 = = = Conflict over command = = = 
 Discussions concerning the scope and nature of base development in the Admiralty Islands were held in early February between representatives of SWPA and Admiral William Halsey , Jr . ' s neighbouring South Pacific Area ( SOPAC ) . The original intention was forces from SWPA would capture the islands and construct the airbase , while SOPAC would be responsible for the development of the naval base . The SOPAC representatives indicated they would not be able to supply troops or materials in the early stages , so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake the initial stages of naval base development . 
 Admiral Nimitz recommended to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that development and control of the base facilities be placed under SOPAC by extending its border westward to include the Admiralties . MacArthur was furious ; the borders of SWPA could not be changed without the consent of the Australian government . Nimitz 's proposal was eventually turned down by the Joint Chiefs but not before MacArthur restricted access to the facilities to ships of the United States Seventh Fleet and British Pacific Fleet . Halsey was summoned to MacArthur 's headquarters in Brisbane on 3 March 1944 , and the two agreed to a compromise . Responsibility for the development of the base passed from Krueger 's Alamo Force to Kinkaid 's Allied Naval Forces on 18 May 1944 . It was proposed control would ultimately pass to SOPAC but it never did . 
 = = = Airbase development = = = 
 Momote airfield was found to have been constructed on a coral subbase with an overburden of coconut palm humus , over which the Japanese had laid a thin layer of coral and coral sand . This would not withstand heavy use , so 40th Naval Construction Battalion , 8th Engineer Squadron , and Shore Battalion of the 592nd EBSR had to strip away the humus and lay a new coral surface . Just 3 @,@ 600 feet ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) of runway was sufficient for the Kittyhawks and Spitfires but the runway was increased to 7 @,@ 800 feet ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) by late April . B @-@ 24s of 5th Bombardment Group moved in on 18 April 1944 and flew their first mission , against Woleai two days later . 
 Plans called for a second airfield at Salami Plantation , but surveys revealed that the site was unsuitable and a new site was found in a coconut plantation near Mokerang . While the 46th Naval Construction Battalion cleared an access road , the <unk> Engineer Aviation Battalion constructed the runway , and the 104th and 46th Naval Construction Battalions built the taxiways and dispersal areas . As at Momote , the humus had to be removed to reach the coral <unk> , which was then graded and compacted . In places the coral was so hard explosives had to be used . The work required the clearing of 1 @,@ 100 acres ( 4 @.@ 5 km2 ) and the removal of 18 @,@ 000 coconut trees . B @-@ 24s of 307th Bombardment Group ( the " Long Rangers " ) arrived on 21 April 1944 . They participated in raids on Biak and supported the Battle of Biak in May . 
 A fighter base to provide repair and overhaul facilities for carrier aircraft was constructed by the 78th Naval Construction Battalion on <unk> Island . As half of the work area was swamp , coral was blasted and dredged from the ocean bed and used as landfill . Another facility for carrier aircraft was built on Pityilu by the 71st Naval Construction Battalion in May and June 1944 , along with accommodation for 2 @,@ 500 men . The eastern end of Pityilu was cleared and a fleet recreation centre was built that could accommodate up to 10 @,@ 000 at a time . 
 = = = Naval base development = = = 
 Construction of the naval base on Los Negros was the responsibility of the 2nd Naval Construction Regiment , with the 11th , 58th and 71st Naval Construction Battalions . Work included a bulk storage at Papitalai for 500 @,@ 000 barrels ( ~ 68 @,@ 000 t ) of fuel oil , 100 @,@ 000 barrels ( ~ 14 @,@ 000 t ) of distillate , 76 @,@ 000 barrels ( ~ 10 @,@ 000 t ) of avgas and 30 @,@ 000 barrels ( ~ 4 @,@ 100 t ) of <unk> ; a 500 bed evacuation hospital ; two Liberty ship wharves ; 24 warehouses and 83 administration buildings in Quonset huts . At <unk> Point , the Seabees built three installations : a seaplane repair base , a ship repair base , and a landing craft repair base . A 250 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 250 t ) pontoon drydock was provided for servicing the landing craft . 
 Development of facilities on Manus was taken in hand by the 5th Naval Construction Regiment , with the 35th , 44th and 57th Naval Construction Battalions , which arrived in mid @-@ April . They erected 128 storage buildings and 50 refrigerators , each of 680 cubic feet ( 19 m3 ) capacity . A water supply system was developed to supply 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 15 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 l ) per day . Two systems were developed , one using streams in the <unk> area that supplied 2 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 l ) per day , and another for outlying areas that used wells to produce 850 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 3 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 l ) per day . The system included water treatment plants , reservoirs , and pipes . All construction work was completed by April 1945 , with the base remaining in use until the end of the war .

 = = Analysis = = 
 The value of the Admiralty Islands to the Allies was enormous . Their capture saved more lives than they cost by obviating the need to capture Truk , Kavieng , Rabaul , and Hansa Bay and thereby speeding up the Allied advance by several months . As an airbase , the Admiralties ' value was great , for aircraft based there ranged over Truk , Wewak , and beyond . As a naval base , their value was greater still , as they combined a fleet anchorage with major facilities . 
 A well @-@ known rule of thumb is that an attacking force needs a 3 : 1 superiority to ensure success . In the opening stages of the battle of Los Negros , the ratio was more like 1 : 4 . In the end the Allies won , " simply because , " wrote Morison , " the United States and Australia dominated that stretch of ocean and the air over it . " When queried about the naval support , General Chase replied , " they didn 't support us ; they saved our necks " . Chase 's own defensive tactics were also a vital factor . He was awarded the Bronze Star for his part , as was MacArthur . 
 Allied commanders , and later historians , debated whether the Admiralty Islands Campaign was the bold action of a great commander or a reckless endeavour that courted disaster . Admiral Fechteler felt , " we 're damn lucky we didn 't get run off the island , " and Admiral Barbey , for one , believed the original plan would have resulted in overrunning the islands in short order with fewer casualties . It would certainly have been much less risky , but it is doubtful whether an assault on the well @-@ defended beaches of Seeadler Harbour would have resulted in fewer casualties . Whereas , in accelerating both MacArthur and Nimitz 's campaigns , it shortened the war by at least a month . Thus , in the final analysis , the campaign " had the great virtue of hastening victory while reducing the number of dead and wounded " . 
 For the Japanese , the loss of the Admiralties meant the loss of their outpost line in the South Eastern Area . Imperial Headquarters now ordered the preparation of a new line in Western New Guinea . The Admiralties operation also indicated the Allies were becoming more ambitious and might bypass Hansa Bay . Accordingly , the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well . 
 = Concorde = 
 Aérospatiale / BAC Concorde / <unk> / is a turbojet @-@ powered supersonic passenger jet airliner that was operated until 2003 . It had a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound at Mach 2 @.@ 04 ( 1 @,@ 354 mph or 2 @,@ 180 km / h at cruise altitude ) , with seating for 92 to 128 passengers . First flown in 1969 , Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued flying for the next 27 years . It is one of only two supersonic transports to have been operated commercially ; the other is the Soviet @-@ built Tupolev Tu @-@ 144 , which was operated for a much shorter period of time . 
 Concorde was jointly developed and manufactured by Aérospatiale and the British Aircraft Corporation ( BAC ) under an Anglo @-@ French treaty . Concorde 's name , meaning harmony or union , reflects the co @-@ operation on the project between the United Kingdom and France . In the UK , any or all of the type are known simply as " Concorde " , with no definite article the . Twenty aircraft were built including six prototypes and development aircraft . Air France ( AF ) and British Airways ( BA ) each received seven aircraft . The research and development failed to make a profit and the two then state @-@ owned airlines bought the aircraft at a huge discount . 
 Among other destinations , Concorde flew regular transatlantic flights from London 's Heathrow Airport and Paris 's Charles de Gaulle Airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York , Washington Dulles International Airport and Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados ; it flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners . Over time , the aircraft became profitable when it found a customer base willing to pay for flights on what was , for most of its career , the fastest commercial airliner in the world . The aircraft is regarded by many as an aviation icon and an engineering marvel while it was also criticised for being uneconomical , and lacking a credible market . 
 Concorde was retired in 2003 after the type 's only crash in 2000 , as well as after a general downturn in the commercial aviation industry , the September 11 attacks in 2001 , and a decision by Airbus , the successor to Aérospatiale and BAC , to discontinue maintenance support . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Early studies = = = 
 The origins of the Concorde project date to the early 1950s , when Arnold Hall , director of the Royal Aircraft Establishment ( RAE ) asked <unk> Morgan to form a committee to study the supersonic transport ( SST ) concept . The group met for the first time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955 . 
 At the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing . This led to the use of very short @-@ span , very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles , or in aircraft like the Lockheed F @-@ 104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied . The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730 . 
 This same short span produced very little lift at low speed , which resulted in extremely long take @-@ off runs and frighteningly high landing speeds . In an SST design , this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways , and to provide the fuel needed , " some horribly large aeroplanes " resulted . Based on this , the group considered the concept of an SST unfeasible , and instead suggested continued low @-@ level studies into supersonic aerodynamics . 
 = = = Slender deltas = = = 
 Soon after , Johanna Weber and Dietrich Küchemann at the RAE published a series of reports on a new wing planform , known in the UK as the " slender delta " concept . The team , including Eric Maskell , worked with the fact that delta wings can produce strong vortexes on their upper surfaces at high angles of attack . The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased . This effect had been noticed earlier , notably by Chuck Yeager in the Convair XF @-@ 92 , but its qualities had not been fully appreciated . Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity , and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance . 
 Küchemann 's and Weber 's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design almost overnight . Although the delta had already been used on aircraft prior to this point , these designs used <unk> that were not much different from a swept wing of the same span . Weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over , which suggested that the effect would be maximised by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible . Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span , while also offering reasonable take @-@ off and landing speeds using vortex generation . The only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to take off and land very " nose high " to generate the required vortex lift , which led to questions about the low speed handling qualities of such a design . It would also need to have long landing gear to produce the required angles while still on the runway . 
 Küchemann presented the idea at a meeting where Morgan was also present . Test pilot Eric Brown recalls Morgan 's reaction to the presentation , saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the SST problem . Brown considers this moment as being the true birth of the Concorde project .

 On 1 October 1956 the Ministry of Supply asked Morgan to form a new study group , the Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee ( STAC ) , with the explicit goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it . At the very first meeting , on 5 November 1956 , the decision was made to fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low speed performance of the slender delta , a contract that eventually produced the Handley Page <unk> This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as 69 mph , about ⅓ that of the F @-@ 104 Starfighter . 
 STAC stated that an SST would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types . Although they would burn more fuel in cruise , they would be able to fly more sorties in a given period of time , so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route . This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs , as it did at the time . STAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work , a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2 , and a shorter @-@ range version flying at perhaps Mach 1 @.@ 2 . Morgan suggested that a 150 passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £ 75 to £ 90 million to develop to production , and be in service in 1970 . The smaller 100 passenger short @-@ range version would cost perhaps £ 50 to £ 80 million , and be ready for service in 1968 . To meet this schedule , development would need to begin in 1960 , with production contracts let in 1962 . Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project , and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft . 
 In 1959 , a study contract was awarded to Hawker Siddeley and Bristol for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept , which developed as the <unk> and Bristol 198 . Armstrong Whitworth also responded with an internal design , the M @-@ Wing , for the lower @-@ speed shorter @-@ range category . Even at this early time , both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs . In September 1959 , Hawker approached Lockheed , and after the creation of British Aircraft Corporation in 1960 , the former Bristol team immediately started talks with Boeing , General Dynamics , Douglas Aircraft and Sud Aviation . 
 = = = <unk> planform selected = = = 
 Küchemann and others at the RAE continued their work on the slender delta throughout , considering three basic shapes ; the classic straight @-@ edge delta , the " gothic delta " that was rounded outwards to appear like a gothic arch , and the " ogival wing " that was compound @-@ rounded into the shape of an ogee . Each of these <unk> had their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of aerodynamics . As they worked with these shapes , a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs . 
 Generally one wants to have the wing 's centre of pressure ( CP , or " lift point " ) close to the aircraft 's centre of gravity ( CG , or " balance point " ) to reduce the amount of control force required to pitch the aircraft . As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase , it is common for the CG to move fore or aft . With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this . With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage , this was no longer easy ; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail . Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes , both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight , the ogee planform immediately came to the fore . 
 While the wing planform was evolving , so was the basic SST concept . Bristol 's original Type 198 was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing , but evolved into the larger Type 223 with an ogival wing and canards as well . 
 = = = Partnership with Sud = = = 
 By this time similar political and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans . In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government @-@ owned Sud and Nord , as well as Dassault . All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber 's slender delta ; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3 , the other two were jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other . Of the three , the Sud Aviation Super @-@ Caravelle won the design contest with a medium @-@ range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board . 
 As soon as the design was complete , in April 1960 , Pierre Satre , the company 's technical director , was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership . Bristol was surprised to find that the Sud team had designed a very similar aircraft after considering the SST problem and coming to the very same conclusions as the Bristol and STAC teams in terms of economics . It was later revealed that the original STAC report , marked " For UK Eyes Only " , had secretly been passed to the French to win political favour . Sud made minor changes to the paper , and presented it as their own work . 
 Unsurprisingly , the two teams found much to agree on . The French had no modern large jet engines , and had already concluded they would buy a British design anyway ( as they had on the earlier subsonic Caravelle ) . As neither company had experience in the use of high @-@ heat metals for airframes , a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used – above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften . This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans . Finally , everyone involved agreed that Küchemann 's ogee shaped wing was the right one . 
 The only disagreements were over the size and range . The UK team was still focused on a 150 passenger design serving transatlantic routes , while the French were deliberately avoiding these . However , this proved not to be the barrier it might seem ; common components could be used in both designs , with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines , the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines , leaving only the wing to be extensively re @-@ designed . The teams continued to meet through 1961 , and by this time it was clear that the two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements . A single design emerged that differed primarily in fuel load . More powerful Bristol Siddeley Olympus engines , being developed for the TSR @-@ 2 , allowed either design to be powered by only four engines . 
 = = = Cabinet response , treaty = = = 
 While the development teams met , French Minister of Public Works and Transport Robert Buron was meeting with the UK Minister of Aviation Peter Thorneycroft , and Thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the French were much more serious about a partnership than any of the US companies . The various US companies had proved uninterested in such a venture , likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company , and the risk of " giving away " US technological leadership to a European partner . 
 When the STAC plans were presented to the UK cabinet , a very negative reaction resulted . The economic considerations were considered highly questionable , especially as these were based on development costs , now estimated to be £ 150 million , which were repeatedly overrun in the industry . The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view , suggesting that there was no way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government , especially in light that " the industry 's past record of over @-@ optimistic estimating ( including the recent history of the <unk> ) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the £ 150 million [ cost ] to turn out much too low . " 
 This concern led to an independent review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development , which met on topic between July and September 1962 . The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments , including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft . Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome , but that the project should still be considered for the simple reason that everyone else was going supersonic , and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets . Conversely , it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other , more important , research efforts . 
 After considerable argument , the decision to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency . At the time , the UK was pressing for admission to the European Common Market , which was being controlled by Charles de Gaulle who felt the UK 's Special Relationship with the US made them unacceptable in a pan @-@ European group . Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would pave the way for Common Market entry , and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal . It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French . However , De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design , and continued to block the UK 's entry into the Common Market . 
 The development project was negotiated as an international treaty between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause , originally asked for by the UK , imposing heavy penalties for cancellation . A draft treaty was signed on 29 November 1962 . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 Reflecting the treaty between the British and French governments that led to Concorde 's construction , the name Concorde is from the French word <unk> ( IPA : [ kɔ ̃ <unk> ] ) , which has an English equivalent , concord . Both words mean agreement , harmony or union . The name was officially changed to Concord by Harold Macmillan in response to a perceived slight by Charles de Gaulle . At the French roll @-@ out in Toulouse in late 1967 , the British Government Minister for Technology , Tony Benn , announced that he would change the spelling back to Concorde . This created a nationalist uproar that died down when Benn stated that the suffixed ' e ' represented " Excellence , England , Europe and Entente ( Cordiale ) . " In his memoirs , he recounts a tale of a letter from an irate Scotsman claiming : " [ Y ] ou talk about ' E ' for England , but part of it is made in Scotland . " Given Scotland 's contribution of providing the nose cone for the aircraft , Benn replied , " [ I ] t was also ' E ' for ' <unk> ' ( the French name for Scotland ) – and I might have added ' e ' for extravagance and ' e ' for escalation as well ! " 
 Concorde also acquired an unusual nomenclature for an aircraft . In common usage in the United Kingdom , the type is known as Concorde without an article , rather than the Concorde or a Concorde .

 At first , the new consortium intended to produce one long @-@ range and one short @-@ range version . However , prospective customers showed no interest in the short @-@ range version and it was dropped . 
 An advertisement covering two full pages , promoting Concorde , ran in 29 May 1967 issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology . The advertisement predicted a market for 350 aircraft by 1980 and boasted of Concorde 's head start over the United States ' SST project . 
 The consortium secured orders ( i.e. , non @-@ binding options ) for over 100 of the long @-@ range version from the major airlines of the day : Pan Am , BOAC , and Air France were the launch customers , with six Concordes each . Other airlines in the order book included Panair do Brasil , Continental Airlines , Japan Airlines , Lufthansa , American Airlines , United Airlines , Air India , Air Canada , Braniff , Singapore Airlines , Iran Air , Olympic Airways , Qantas , <unk> , Middle East Airlines , and TWA . At the time of the first flight the options list contained 74 options from 16 airlines :

 The design work was supported by a preceding research programme studying the flight characteristics of low ratio delta wings . A supersonic Fairey Delta 2 was modified and – as the BAC 221 – was used for flight tests of the high speed flight envelope , the Handley Page <unk> also provided valuable information on low speed performance . 
 Construction of two prototypes began in February 1965 : 001 , built by Aérospatiale at Toulouse , and 002 , by BAC at Filton , Bristol . Concorde 001 made its first test flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969 , piloted by André <unk> , and first went supersonic on 1 October . The first UK @-@ built Concorde flew from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969 , piloted by Brian Trubshaw . Both prototypes were presented to the public for the first time on 7 – 8 June 1969 at the Paris Air Show . As the flight programme progressed , 001 embarked on a sales and demonstration tour on 4 September 1971 , which was also the first transatlantic crossing of Concorde . Concorde 002 followed suit on 2 June 1972 with a tour of the Middle and Far East . Concorde 002 made the first visit to the United States in 1973 , landing at the new Dallas / Fort Worth Regional Airport to mark that airport 's opening . 
 While Concorde had initially held a great deal of customer interest , the project was hit by a large number of order cancellations . The Paris Le Bourget air show crash of the competing Soviet Tupolev Tu @-@ 144 had shocked potential buyers , and public concern over the environmental issues presented by a supersonic aircraft – the sonic boom , take @-@ off noise and pollution – had produced a shift in public opinion of SSTs . By 1976 four nations remained as prospective buyers : Britain , France , China , and Iran . Only Air France and British Airways ( the successor to BOAC ) took up their orders , with the two governments taking a cut of any profits made . 
 The United States cancelled the Boeing 2707 , its rival supersonic transport programme , in 1971 . Observers have suggested that opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution had been encouraged by the United States Government , as it lacked its own competitor . The US , India , and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern , although some of these restrictions were later relaxed . Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President Jimmy Carter 's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers . Concorde flew to an altitude of 68 @,@ 000 ft ( 20 @,@ 700 m ) during a test flight in June 1973 . 
 Concorde had other considerable difficulties that led to its dismal sales performance . Costs had spiralled during development to more than six times the original projections , arriving at a unit cost of £ 23 million in 1977 . World events had also dampened Concorde sales prospects , the 1973 oil crisis made many airlines think twice about aircraft with high fuel consumption rates ; and new wide @-@ body aircraft , such as the Boeing 747 , had recently made subsonic aircraft significantly more efficient and presented a low @-@ risk option for airlines . While carrying a full load , Concorde achieved 15 @.@ 8 passenger miles per gallon of fuel , while the Boeing 707 reached 33 @.@ 3 pm / g , the Boeing 747 46 @.@ 4 pm / g , and the McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10 53 @.@ 6 pm / g . An emerging trend in the industry in favour of cheaper airline tickets had also caused airlines such as Qantas to question Concorde 's market suitability .

 Concorde is an ogival delta winged aircraft with four Olympus engines based on those employed in the RAF 's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber . It is one of the few commercial aircraft to employ a tailless design ( the Tupolev Tu @-@ 144 being another ) . Concorde was the first airliner to have a ( in this case , analogue ) fly @-@ by @-@ wire flight @-@ control system ; the avionics system the Concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits . The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre , with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy . 
 Concorde pioneered the following technologies : 
 For high speed and optimisation of flight : 
 Double delta ( ogee / ogival ) shaped wings 
 Variable engine air intake ramp system controlled by digital computers 
 Supercruise capability 
 Thrust @-@ by @-@ wire engines , predecessor of today 's FADEC @-@ controlled engines 
 Droop @-@ nose section for better landing visibility 
 For weight @-@ saving and enhanced performance : 
 Mach 2 @.@ 04 ( ~ 2 @,@ 179 km / h or 1 @,@ 354 mph ) cruising speed for optimum fuel consumption ( supersonic drag minimum although turbojet engines are more efficient at higher speed ) Fuel consumption at Mach 2 @.@ 0 and at altitude of 60 @,@ 000 feet ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) was 4 @,@ 800 gallons per hour ( 22 @,@ 000 L / h ) . 
 Mainly aluminium construction for low weight and conventional manufacture ( higher speeds would have ruled out aluminium ) 
 Full @-@ regime autopilot and autothrottle allowing " hands off " control of the aircraft from climb out to landing 
 Fully electrically controlled analogue fly @-@ by @-@ wire flight controls systems 
 High @-@ pressure hydraulic system of 28 MPa ( 4 @,@ 000 lbf / in ² ) for lighter hydraulic components , tripled independent systems ( " Blue " , " Green " , and " Yellow " ) for redundancy , with an emergency ram air turbine ( RAT ) stored in the port @-@ inner <unk> jack fairing supplying " Green " and " Yellow " as backup . 
 Complex Air data computer ( ADC ) for the automated monitoring and transmission of aerodynamic measurements ( total pressure , static pressure , angle of attack , side @-@ slip ) . 
 Fully electrically controlled analogue brake @-@ by @-@ wire system 
 Pitch trim by shifting fuel around the fuselage for centre @-@ of @-@ gravity ( <unk> ) control at the approach to Mach 1 and above with no drag penalty . 
 Parts made using " sculpture milling " , reducing the part count while saving weight and adding strength . 
 No auxiliary power unit , as Concorde would only visit large airports where ground air start carts are available . 
 = = = Powerplant = = = 
 Concorde needed to fly long distances to be economically viable ; this required high efficiency . <unk> engines were rejected due to their larger cross @-@ section producing excessive drag . <unk> were found to be the best choice of engines . The engine used was the twin spool Rolls @-@ Royce / Snecma Olympus 593 , a development of the Bristol engine first used for the Avro Vulcan bomber , and developed into an afterburning supersonic variant for the BAC TSR @-@ 2 strike bomber . Rolls @-@ Royce 's own engine proposed for the aircraft at the time of Concorde 's initial design was the <unk> 
 The aircraft used reheat ( afterburners ) at take @-@ off and to pass through the upper transonic regime and to supersonic speeds , between Mach 0 @.@ 95 and Mach 1 @.@ 7 . The afterburners were switched off at all other times . Due to jet engines being highly inefficient at low speeds , Concorde burned two tonnes of fuel ( almost 2 % of the maximum fuel load ) taxiing to the runway . Fuel used is Jet A @-@ 1 . Due to the high thrust produced even with the engines at idle , only the two outer engines were run after landing for easier taxiing and less brake pad wear - at low weights after landing the aircraft would not remain stationary with all four engines idling requiring the brakes to be continuously applied to prevent the aircraft moving . 
 The intake design for Concorde 's engines was especially critical . The intakes had to provide low distortion levels ( to prevent engine surge ) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures to be met in cruise . They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine @-@ face distortion at take @-@ off . They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns . The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps , a dump door , an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle . 
 As well as supplying air to the engine , the intake also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle . The nozzle ejector ( or aerodynamic ) design , with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake , contributed to good expansion efficiency from take @-@ off to cruise . 
 Engine failure causes problems on conventional subsonic aircraft ; not only does the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag , causing the aircraft to yaw and bank in the direction of the failed engine . If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds , it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe . Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems , in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties . During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero so , on Concorde , engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps , which deflected the air downwards past the engine , gaining lift and minimising drag . Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure . 
 Concorde 's Air Intake Control Units ( <unk> ) made use of a digital processor to provide the necessary accuracy for intake control . It was the world 's first use of a digital processor to be given full authority control of an essential system in a passenger aircraft . It was developed by the Electronics and Space Systems ( ESS ) division of the British Aircraft Corporation after it became clear that the analogue <unk> fitted to the prototype aircraft and developed by Ultra Electronics were found to be insufficiently accurate for the tasks in hand . 
 Concorde 's thrust @-@ by @-@ wire engine control system was also developed by Ultra Electronics . 
 = = = Heating issues = = = 
 Air compression on the outer surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight . Every surface , such as windows and panels , was warm to the touch by the end of the flight . Besides engines , the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft , due to aerodynamic heating , is the nose . The engineers used <unk> R.R. 58 , an aluminium alloy , throughout the aircraft due to its familiarity , cost and ease of construction . The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was 127 ° C ( 261 ° F ) , which limited the top speed to Mach 2 @.@ 02 . Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight , first cooling down as it gained altitude , then heating up after going supersonic . The reverse happened when descending and slowing down . This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling . A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full @-@ size section of the wing , and then cooled it , and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing . The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45 @,@ 000 flying hours . 
 Owing to air compression in front of the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed , the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300 mm ( almost 1 ft ) . The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer 's console and the bulkhead . On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight , the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap , wedging the cap when it shrank again . To keep the cabin cool , Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning . The same method also cooled the hydraulics . During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated , and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit . 
 Concorde had livery restrictions ; the majority of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2 . The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius . In 1996 , Air France briefly painted F @-@ BTSD in a predominantly blue livery , with the exception of the wings , in a promotional deal with Pepsi . In this paint scheme , Air France were advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time , but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1 @.@ 7 . F @-@ BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations . 
 = = = Structural issues = = = 
 Due to its high speeds , large forces were applied to the aircraft during banks and turns , and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft 's structure . In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds . Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons , varying at differing speeds including supersonic . Only the innermost elevons , which are attached to the stiffest area of the wings , were active at high speed . Additionally , the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed . This was visible from the rear passengers ' viewpoints . 
 When any aircraft passes the critical mach of that particular airframe , the centre of pressure shifts rearwards . This causes a pitch down force on the aircraft if the centre of mass remains where it was . The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift , but there was still a shift of about 2 metres . This could have been countered by the use of trim controls , but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag . Instead , the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of mass , effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control . 
 = = = Range = = = 
 To fly non @-@ stop across the Atlantic Ocean , Concorde required the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft . This was achieved by a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds , a slender fuselage with high fineness ratio , and a complex wing shape for a high lift @-@ to @-@ drag ratio . This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity , and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag . 
 Nevertheless , soon after Concorde began flying , a Concorde " B " model was designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds , with the objective of expanding the range to reach markets in new regions . It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel @-@ hungry and noisy afterburner . It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25 % gain in efficiency over the Rolls @-@ Royce / Snecma Olympus 593 . This would have given 500 mi ( 805 km ) additional range and a greater payload , making new commercial routes possible . This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde , but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s . 
 = = = Radiation concerns = = = 
 Concorde 's high cruising altitude meant passengers received almost twice the flux of extraterrestrial ionising radiation as those travelling on a conventional long @-@ haul flight . Upon Concorde 's introduction , it was speculated that this exposure during supersonic travels would increase the likelihood of skin cancer . Due to the proportionally reduced flight time , the overall equivalent dose would normally be less than a conventional flight over the same distance . Unusual solar activity might lead to an increase in incident radiation . To prevent incidents of excessive radiation exposure , the flight deck had a radiometer and an instrument to measure the rate of decrease of radiation . If the radiation level became too high , Concorde would descend below 47 @,@ 000 feet ( 14 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 = = = Cabin pressurisation = = = 
 Airliner cabins were usually maintained at a pressure equivalent to 6 @,@ 000 – 8 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 – 2 @,@ 400 m ) elevation . Concorde 's pressurisation was set to an altitude at the lower end of this range , 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) . Concorde 's maximum cruising altitude was 60 @,@ 000 feet ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) ; subsonic airliners typically cruise below 40 @,@ 000 feet ( 12 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 A sudden reduction in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew . Above 50 @,@ 000 feet ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) , a sudden cabin depressurisation would leave a " time of useful consciousness " up to 10 – 15 seconds for a conditioned athlete . At Concorde 's altitude , the air density is very low ; a breach of cabin integrity would result in a loss of pressure severe enough so that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would soon suffer from hypoxia despite quickly donning them . Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss in the event of a breach , a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure , and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude . The FAA enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and noting Concorde 's higher operating altitude , concluded that the best response to pressure loss would be a rapid descent . Continuous positive airway pressure would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks . 
 = = = Flight characteristics = = = 
 While subsonic commercial jets took eight hours to fly from New York to Paris , the average supersonic flight time on the transatlantic routes was just under 3 @.@ 5 hours . Concorde had a maximum cruise altitude of 18 @,@ 300 metres ( 60 @,@ 039 ft ) and an average cruise speed of Mach 2 @.@ 02 , about 1155 knots ( <unk> km / h or 1334 mph ) , more than twice the speed of conventional aircraft . 
 With no other civil traffic operating at its cruising altitude of about 56 @,@ 000 ft ( 17 @,@ 000 m ) , dedicated oceanic airways or " tracks " were used by Concorde to cross the Atlantic . Due to the nature of high altitude winds , these SST tracks were fixed in terms of their co @-@ ordinates , unlike the North Atlantic Tracks at lower altitudes whose co @-@ ordinates alter daily according to forecast weather patterns ( <unk> ) . Concorde would also be cleared in a 15 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) block , allowing for a slow climb from 45 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 ft ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased . In regular service , Concorde employed an efficient cruise @-@ climb flight profile following take @-@ off . 
 The delta @-@ shaped wings required Concorde to adopt a higher angle of attack at low speeds than conventional aircraft , but it allowed the formation of large low pressure vortices over the entire upper wing surface , maintaining lift . The normal landing speed was 170 miles per hour ( 274 km / h ) . Because of this high angle , during a landing approach Concorde was on the " back side " of the drag force curve , where raising the nose would increase the rate of descent ; the aircraft was thus largely flown on the throttle and was fitted with an autothrottle to reduce the pilot 's workload . 
 " The only thing that tells you that you 're moving is that occasionally when you 're flying over the subsonic aeroplanes you can see all these 747s 20 @,@ 000 feet below you almost appearing to go backwards , I mean you are going 800 miles an hour or thereabouts faster than they are . The aeroplane was an absolute delight to fly , it handled beautifully . And remember we are talking about an aeroplane that was being designed in the late 1950s – mid 1960s . I think it 's absolutely amazing and here we are , now in the 21st century , and it remains unique . " 
 = = = Brakes and undercarriage = = = 
 Because of the way Concorde 's delta @-@ wing generated lift , the undercarriage had to be unusually strong . At rotation , Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack , about 18 degrees . Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift , unlike typical aircraft wings . Combined with the high airspeed at rotation ( 199 knots indicated airspeed ) , this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage in a way that was initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign . Due to the high angle needed at rotation , a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent <unk> . The main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to retract telescopically before swinging to clear each other when stowed . The four main wheel tyres on each bogie unit are inflated to 232 lb / sq in . The twin @-@ wheel nose undercarriage retracts forwards and its tyres are inflated to a pressure of 191 lb / sq in , and the wheel assembly carries a spray deflector to prevent standing water being thrown up into the engine intakes . The tyres are rated to 250 mph . The starboard nose wheel carries a single disc brake to halt wheel rotation during retraction of the undercarriage . The port nose wheel carries speed generators for the anti @-@ skid braking system which prevents brake activation until nose and main wheels rotate at the same rate . 
 Additionally , due to the high average take @-@ off speed of 250 miles per hour ( 400 km / h ) , Concorde needed upgraded brakes . Like most airliners , Concorde has anti @-@ skid braking – a system which prevents the tyres from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll @-@ out . The brakes , developed by Dunlop , were the first carbon @-@ based brakes used on an airliner . The use of carbon over equivalent steel brakes provided a weight @-@ saving of 1 @,@ 200 lb ( 544 kg ) . Each wheel has multiple discs which are cooled by electric fans . Wheel sensors include brake overload , brake temperature , and tyre deflation . After a typical landing at Heathrow , brake temperatures were around 300 – 400 ° C ( 572 – 752 ° F ) . For landing Concorde required a minimum of 6 @,@ 000 feet runway length , this in fact being considerably less than the shortest runway Concorde ever actually landed on , that of Cardiff Airport . 
 = = = Droop nose = = = 
 Concorde 's drooping nose , developed by Marshall Aerospace , enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimum aerodynamic efficiency , and not obstructing the pilot 's view during taxi , take @-@ off , and landing operations . Due to the high angle of attack , the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop . The droop nose was accompanied by a moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered . When the nose was raised to horizontal , the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining . 
 A controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5 ° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take @-@ off . Following take @-@ off and after clearing the airport , the nose and visor were raised . Prior to landing , the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12 @.@ 5 ° below horizontal for maximum visibility . Upon landing the nose was raised to the five @-@ degree position to avoid the possibility of damage . 
 The US Federal Aviation Administration had objected to the restrictive visibility of the visor used on the first two prototype Concordes and thus requiring alteration before the FAA would permit Concorde to serve US airports ; this led to the redesigned visor used on the production and the four pre @-@ production aircraft ( 101 , 102 , 201 , and 202 ) . The nose window and visor glass needed to endure temperatures in excess of 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) at supersonic flight were developed by Triplex .

 = = = Scheduled flights = = = 
 Scheduled flights began on 21 January 1976 on the London – Bahrain and Paris – Rio de Janeiro ( via Dakar ) routes , with BA flights using the Speedbird Concorde call sign to notify air traffic control of the aircraft 's unique abilities and restrictions , but the French using their normal call signs . The Paris @-@ Caracas route ( via Azores ) began on 10 April . The US Congress had just banned Concorde landings in the US , mainly due to citizen protest over sonic booms , preventing launch on the coveted North Atlantic routes . The US Secretary of Transportation , William Coleman , gave permission for Concorde service to Washington Dulles International Airport , and Air France and British Airways simultaneously began service to Dulles on 24 May 1976 . 
 When the US ban on JFK Concorde operations was lifted in February 1977 , New York banned Concorde locally . The ban came to an end on 17 October 1977 when the Supreme Court of the United States declined to overturn a lower court 's ruling rejecting efforts by the Port Authority and a grass @-@ roots campaign led by Carol Berman to continue the ban . In spite of complaints about noise , the noise report noted that Air Force One , at the time a Boeing VC @-@ 137 , was louder than Concorde at subsonic speeds and during take @-@ off and landing . Scheduled service from Paris and London to New York 's John F. Kennedy Airport began on 22 November 1977 . 
 In 1977 , British Airways and Singapore Airlines shared a Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain . The aircraft , BA 's Concorde G @-@ BOAD , was painted in Singapore Airlines livery on the port side and British Airways livery on the starboard side . The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government ; it could only be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979 . A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace , so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980 . 
 During the Mexican oil boom , Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City 's Benito Juárez International Airport via Washington , DC , or New York City , from September 1978 to November 1982 . The worldwide economic crisis during that period resulted in this route 's cancellation ; the last flights were almost empty . The routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration , from Mach 2 @.@ 02 to Mach 0 @.@ 95 , to cross Florida <unk> and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state ; Concorde then re @-@ accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico . On 1 April 1989 , on an around @-@ the @-@ world luxury tour charter , British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G @-@ BOAF to maintain Mach 2 @.@ 02 by passing around Florida to the east and south . Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco . 
 From December 1978 to May 1980 , Braniff International Airways leased 11 Concordes , five from Air France and six from British Airways . These were used on subsonic flights between Dallas @-@ Fort Worth and Washington Dulles International Airport , flown by Braniff flight crews . Air France and British Airways crews then took over for the continuing supersonic flights to London and Paris . The aircraft were registered in both the United States and their home countries ; the European registration was covered while being operated by Braniff , retaining full AF / BA liveries . The flights were not profitable and typically less than 50 % booked , forcing Braniff to end its tenure as the only US Concorde operator in May 1980 . 
 In its early years , the British Airways Concorde service had a greater number of " no shows " ( passengers who booked a flight and then failed to appear at the gate for boarding ) than any other aircraft in the fleet . 
 = = = British Caledonian interest = = = 
 Following the launch of British Airways Concorde services , Britain 's other major airline , British Caledonian ( BCal ) , set up a task force headed by Gordon Davidson , BA 's former Concorde director , to investigate the possibility of their own Concorde operations . This was seen as particularly viable for the airline 's long @-@ haul network as there were two unsold aircraft then available for purchase . 
 One important reason for BCal 's interest in Concorde was that the British Government 's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal 's established sphere of influence . To counteract this potential threat , BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans , as well as a partnership with BA . BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick – Lagos route , a major source of revenue and profits within BCal 's scheduled route network ; BCal 's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route . 
 BCal entered into a bid to acquire at least one Concorde . However , BCal eventually arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and Aérospatiale respectively , to be maintained by either BA or Air France . BCal 's envisaged two @-@ Concorde fleet would have required a high level of aircraft utilisation to be cost @-@ effective ; therefore , BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta , with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax . Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage . Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980 ; however , steeply rising oil prices caused by the 1979 energy crisis led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions . 
 = = = British Airways buys its Concordes outright = = = 
 By around 1981 in the UK , the future for Concorde looked bleak . The British government had lost money operating Concorde every year , and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely . A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down . Despite this , the government was not keen to continue . In 1983 , BA 's managing director , Sir John King , convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to British Airways for £ 16 @.@ 5 million plus the first year 's profits . 
 King recognised that , in Concorde , BA had a premier product that was <unk> . Market research had revealed that many customers thought Concorde was more expensive than it actually was ; thus ticket prices were progressively raised to match these perceptions . It is reported that British Airways then ran Concorde at a profit , unlike their French counterpart . 
 Between 1984 and 1991 , British Airways flew a thrice @-@ weekly Concorde service between London and Miami , stopping at Washington Dulles International Airport . Until 2003 , Air France and British Airways continued to operate the New York services daily . Concorde routinely flew to Grantley Adams International Airport , Barbados , during the winter holiday season . 
 Prior to the Air France Paris crash , several UK and French tour operators operated charter flights to European destinations on a regular basis ; the charter business was viewed as lucrative by British Airways and Air France . 
 In 1997 , British Airways held a promotional contest to mark the 10th anniversary of the airline 's move into the private sector . The promotion was a lottery to fly to New York held for 190 tickets valued at £ 5 @,@ 400 each , to be offered at £ 10 . Contestants had to call a special hotline to compete with up to 20 million people . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 On 10 April 2003 , Air France and British Airways simultaneously announced that they would retire Concorde later that year . They cited low passenger numbers following 25 July 2000 crash , the slump in air travel following the September 11 attacks , and rising maintenance costs . Although Concorde was technologically advanced when introduced in the 1970s , 30 years later , its analogue cockpit was outdated . There had been little commercial pressure to upgrade Concorde due to a lack of competing aircraft , unlike other airliners of the same era such as the Boeing 747 . By its retirement , it was the last aircraft in the British Airways fleet that had a flight engineer ; other aircraft , such as the modernised 747 @-@ 400 , had eliminated the role . 
 On 11 April 2003 , Virgin Atlantic founder Sir Richard Branson announced that the company was interested in purchasing British Airways ' Concorde fleet for their nominal original price of £ 1 ( US $ 1 @.@ 57 in April 2003 ) each . British Airways dismissed the idea , prompting Virgin to increase their offer to £ 1 million each . Branson claimed that when BA was privatised , a clause in the agreement required them to allow another British airline to operate Concorde if BA ceased to do so , but the Government denied the existence of such a clause . In October 2003 , Branson wrote in The Economist that his final offer was " over £ 5 million " and that he had intended to operate the fleet " for many years to come " . The chances for keeping Concorde in service were stifled by Airbus 's lack of support for continued maintenance . 
 It has been suggested that Concorde was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given but that it became apparent during the grounding of Concorde that the airlines could make more profit carrying first class passengers <unk> . A lack of commitment to Concorde from Director of Engineering Alan MacDonald was cited as having undermined BA 's resolve to continue operating Concorde .

 Air France made its final commercial Concorde landing in the United States in New York City from Paris on 30 May 2003 . Air France 's final Concorde flight took place on 27 June 2003 when F @-@ <unk> retired to Toulouse . 
 An auction of Concorde parts and memorabilia for Air France was held at Christie 's in Paris on 15 November 2003 ; 1 @,@ 300 people attended , and several lots exceeded their predicted values . French Concorde F @-@ <unk> was retired to Toulouse and kept functional for a short time after the end of service , in case taxi runs were required in support of the French judicial enquiry into the 2000 crash . The aircraft is now fully retired and no longer functional . 
 French Concorde F @-@ BTSD has been retired to the " Musée de l 'Air " at Paris – Le Bourget Airport near Paris ; unlike the other museum Concordes , a few of the systems are being kept functional . For instance , the famous " droop nose " can still be lowered and raised . This led to rumours that they could be prepared for future flights for special occasions . 
 French Concorde F @-@ <unk> currently rests at the Auto & Technik Museum Sinsheim at Sinsheim , Germany , after its last flight from Paris to Baden @-@ Baden , followed by a spectacular transport to Sinsheim via barge and road . The museum also has a Tupolev Tu @-@ 144 on display – this is the only place where both supersonic airliners can be seen together . 
 In 1989 , Air France signed a letter of agreement to donate a Concorde to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. upon the aircraft 's retirement . On 12 June 2003 , Air France honoured that agreement , donating Concorde F @-@ <unk> ( serial 205 ) to the Museum upon the completion of its last flight . This aircraft was the first Air France Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro , Washington , D.C. , and New York and had flown 17 @,@ 824 hours . It is on display at the Smithsonian 's Steven F. Udvar @-@ Hazy Center at Dulles Airport .

 British Airways conducted a North American farewell tour in October 2003 . G @-@ BOAG visited Toronto Pearson International Airport on 1 October , after which it flew to New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport . G @-@ BOAD visited Boston 's Logan International Airport on 8 October , and G @-@ BOAG visited Washington Dulles International Airport on 14 October . It has been claimed that G @-@ BOAD 's flight from London Heathrow to Boston set a transatlantic flight record of 3 hours , 5 minutes , 34 seconds . However the fastest transatlantic flight was from New York JFK airport to Heathrow on 7 February 1996 , taking 2 hours , 52 minutes , 59 seconds ; 90 seconds less than a record set in April 1990 . 
 In a week of farewell flights around the United Kingdom , Concorde visited Birmingham on 20 October , Belfast on 21 October , Manchester on 22 October , Cardiff on 23 October , and Edinburgh on 24 October . Each day the aircraft made a return flight out and back into Heathrow to the cities , often overflying them at low altitude . On 22 October , both Concorde flight <unk> , a special from Manchester , and <unk> from New York landed simultaneously on both of Heathrow 's runways . On 23 October 2003 , the Queen consented to the illumination of Windsor Castle , an honour reserved for state events and visiting dignitaries , as Concorde 's last west @-@ bound commercial flight departed London . 
 British Airways retired its Concorde fleet on 24 October 2003 . G @-@ BOAG left New York to a fanfare similar to that given for Air France 's F @-@ BTSD , while two more made round trips , G @-@ BOAF over the Bay of Biscay , carrying VIP guests including former Concorde pilots , and G @-@ <unk> to Edinburgh . The three aircraft then circled over London , having received special permission to fly at low altitude , before landing in sequence at Heathrow . The captain of the New York to London flight was Mike Bannister . The final flight of a Concorde in the US occurred on 5 November 2003 when G @-@ BOAG flew from New York 's JFK Airport to Seattle 's Boeing Field to join the Museum of Flight 's permanent collection . The plane was piloted by Mike Bannister and Les <unk> who claimed a flight time of three hours , 55 minutes and 12 seconds , a record between the two cities . The museum had been pursuing a Concorde for their collection since 1984 . The final flight of a Concorde world @-@ wide took place on 26 November 2003 with a landing at Filton , Bristol , UK . 
 All of BA 's Concorde fleet have been grounded , drained of hydraulic fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn . Jock Lowe , ex @-@ chief Concorde pilot and manager of the fleet estimated in 2004 that it would cost £ 10 – 15 million to make G @-@ BOAF airworthy again . BA maintain ownership and have stated that they will not fly again due to a lack of support from Airbus . On 1 December 2003 , Bonhams held an auction of British Airways Concorde artefacts , including a nose cone , at Kensington Olympia in London . Proceeds of around £ 750 @,@ 000 were raised , with the majority going to charity . G @-@ BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea , Air & Space Museum in New York . In 2007 , BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40 % scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained ; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum .

 Although only used for spares after being retired from test flying and trials work in 1981 , Concorde G @-@ <unk> was dismantled and transported by road from Filton then restored from essentially a shell at the Brooklands Museum in Surrey , where it remains open to visitors to the museum . 
 One of the youngest Concordes ( F @-@ BTSD ) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris . In February 2010 , it was announced that the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F @-@ BTSD so it can taxi under its own power . In May 2010 , it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum ; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations . Save Concorde Group hoped to get F @-@ BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics , but this never happened . The work for restoring F @-@ BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently not very well known , and it is still being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit . In 2015 , the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £ 120 million for a static display and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget , restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019 , to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Concorde 's first flight . 
 In July 2015 , it was reported that planning permission had been granted for the construction of the museum at Bristol Filton Airport to house G @-@ BOAF the last Concorde where it is intended to form a key exhibit of the new Bristol Aviation Heritage Museum .

 In September 2015 , it was publicly revealed that the Club Concorde had secured over £ 160 million to return an aircraft to service .

Now that money is no longer the problem it 's over to those who can help us make it happen . " The organisation aims to buy the Concorde currently on display at Le Bourget airport . A tentative date of 2019 has been put forward for the first flight – 50 years after its maiden journey .

 = = = Air France Flight 4590 = = = 
 On 25 July 2000 , Air France Flight 4590 , registration F @-@ <unk> , crashed in <unk> , France after departing from Paris @-@ Charles de Gaulle en route to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City , killing all 100 passengers and 9 crew members on board the flight , and 4 people on the ground . It was the only fatal accident involving Concorde . 
 According to the official investigation conducted by the Bureau d 'Enquêtes et d 'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l 'Aviation Civile ( BEA ) , the crash was caused by a metallic strip that fell from a Continental Airlines DC @-@ 10 that had taken off minutes earlier . This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde 's left main wheel bogie during take @-@ off . The tyre exploded , and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank , which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire . The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning , and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power , the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed . The aircraft entered a rapid pitch @-@ up then a violent descent , rolling left and crashing tail @-@ low into the <unk> Les <unk> Bleus Hotel in <unk> . 
 The claim that a metallic strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses ( including the pilot of Jacques Chirac 's aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when Flight 4590 caught fire ) and by an independent French TV investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left @-@ side main gear and that the plane caught fire some 1 @,@ 000 feet from where the metallic strip lay . 
 On 6 December 2010 , Continental Airlines and John Taylor , one of its mechanics , were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter , but on 30 November 2012 , a French court overturned the conviction , saying mistakes by Continental and Taylor did not make them criminally responsible . 
 Prior to the accident , Concorde had been arguably the safest operational passenger airliner in the world in passenger deaths @-@ per @-@ kilometres travelled with zero , but there had been two prior non @-@ fatal accidents and a rate of tyre damage some 30 times higher than subsonic airliners from 1995 to 2000 . Safety improvements were made in the wake of the crash , including more secure electrical controls , Kevlar lining on the fuel tanks and specially developed burst @-@ resistant tyres . The first flight with the modifications departed from London Heathrow on 17 July 2001 , piloted by BA Chief Concorde Pilot Mike Bannister . During the 3 @-@ hour 20 @-@ minute flight over the mid @-@ Atlantic towards Iceland , Bannister attained Mach 2 @.@ 02 and 60 @,@ 000 ft ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) before returning to RAF <unk> Norton . The test flight , intended to resemble the London – New York route , was declared a success and was watched on live TV , and by crowds on the ground at both locations . 
 The first flight with passengers after the accident took place on 11 September 2001 , landing shortly before the World Trade Center attacks in the United States . This was not a commercial flight : all the passengers were BA employees . Normal commercial operations resumed on 7 November 2001 by BA and AF ( aircraft G @-@ <unk> and F @-@ BTSD ) , with service to New York JFK , where mayor Rudy Giuliani greeted the passengers . 
 = = = Other accidents and incidents = = = 
 Concorde had suffered two previous non @-@ fatal accidents that were similar to each other . 
 12 April 1989 : A Concorde of British registration , G @-@ BOAF , on a chartered flight from Christchurch , New Zealand , to Sydney , suffered a structural failure in @-@ flight at supersonic speed . As the aircraft was climbing and accelerating through Mach 1 @.@ 7 a " thud " was heard . The crew did not notice any handling problems , and they assumed the thud they heard was a minor engine surge . No further difficulty was encountered until descent through 40 @,@ 000 feet at Mach 1 @.@ 3 , when a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft , lasting two to three minutes . Most of the upper rudder had become separated from the aircraft at this point . Aircraft handling was unaffected , and the aircraft made a safe landing at Sydney . The UK 's Air Accidents Investigation Branch ( AAIB ) concluded that the skin of the rudder had been separating from the rudder structure over a period of time before the accident due to moisture seepage past the rivets in the rudder . Furthermore , production staff had not followed proper procedures during an earlier modification of the rudder , but the procedures were difficult to adhere to . 
 21 March 1992 : A Concorde of British registration , G @-@ <unk> , on a scheduled flight from London to New York , also suffered a structural failure in @-@ flight at supersonic speed . While cruising at Mach 2 , at approximately 53 @,@ 000 feet above mean sea level , the crew heard a " thump " . No difficulties in handling were noticed , and no instruments gave any irregular indications . This crew also suspected there had been a minor engine surge . One hour later , during descent and decelerating below Mach 1 @.@ 4 , a sudden " severe " vibration began throughout the aircraft . The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine , and it was attenuated when that engine 's power was reduced . The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York , noting only that increased rudder control was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course . Again , the skin had become separated from the structure of the rudder , which led to most of the upper rudder becoming separated in @-@ flight . The ( AAIB ) concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair , weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder , leading to it breaking up in @-@ flight . The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure , and prior to this accident , the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated . 
 A 2010 trial involving Continental Airlines over the crash of Flight 4590 established that from 1976 until Flight 4590 there had been 57 tyre failures involving Concordes during takeoffs , including a near @-@ crash at Dulles Airport on 14 June 1979 involving Air France Flight 54 where a tyre blowout pierced the plane 's fuel tank and damaged the port @-@ side engine , electrical cables , with the loss of two of the craft 's hydraulic systems .

 The only supersonic airliner in direct competition with Concorde was the Soviet Tupolev Tu @-@ 144 , nicknamed " <unk> " by Western European journalists for its outward similarity to Concorde . It had been alleged that Soviet espionage efforts had resulted in the theft of Concorde blueprints , ostensibly to assist in the design of the Tu @-@ 144 . As a result of a rushed development programme , the first Tu @-@ 144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines , but both were cruder than Concorde . The Tu @-@ <unk> had a significantly shorter range than Concorde , due to its low @-@ bypass turbofan engines . The aircraft had poor control at low speeds because of a simpler supersonic wing design ; in addition the Tu @-@ 144 required braking parachutes to land while Concorde used anti @-@ lock brakes . The Tu @-@ 144 had two crashes , one at the 1973 Paris Air Show , and another during a pre @-@ delivery test flight in May 1978 . 
 Later production Tu @-@ 144 versions were more refined and competitive . They had retractable canards for better low @-@ speed control , turbojet engines providing nearly the fuel efficiency and range of Concorde and a top speed of Mach 2 @.@ 35 . Passenger service commenced in November 1977 , but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of service . The aircraft had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing . 
 The American designs , the Boeing 2707 and the Lockheed L @-@ 2000 , were to have been larger , with seating for up to 300 people . Running a few years behind Concorde , the Boeing 2707 was redesigned to a cropped delta layout ; the extra cost of these changes helped to kill the project . The operation of US military aircraft such as the XB @-@ 70 Valkyrie and B @-@ 58 Hustler had shown that sonic booms were quite capable of reaching the ground , and the experience from the Oklahoma City sonic boom tests led to the same environmental concerns that hindered the commercial success of Concorde . The American government cancelled its SST project in 1971 , after having spent more than $ 1 billion . 
 The only other large supersonic aircraft comparable to Concorde are strategic bombers , principally the Russian Tu @-@ 22 , Tu @-@ 22M , M @-@ 50 ( experimental ) , T @-@ 4 ( experimental ) , Tu @-@ 160 and the American XB @-@ 70 ( experimental ) and B @-@ 1 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 = = = Environmental = = = 
 Before Concorde 's flight trials , developments in the civil aviation industry were largely accepted by governments and their respective electorates . Opposition to Concorde 's noise , particularly on the east coast of the United States , forged a new political agenda on both sides of the Atlantic , with scientists and technology experts across a multitude of industries beginning to take the environmental and social impact more seriously . Although Concorde led directly to the introduction of a general noise abatement programme for aircraft flying out of John F. Kennedy Airport , many found that Concorde was quieter than expected , partly due to the pilots temporarily throttling back their engines to reduce noise during overflight of residential areas . Even before commercial flights started , it had been claimed that Concorde was quieter than many other aircraft . In 1971 , BAC 's technical director was quoted as saying , " It is certain on present evidence and calculations that in the airport context , production Concordes will be no worse than aircraft now in service and will in fact be better than many of them . " 
 Concorde produced nitrogen oxides in its exhaust , which , despite complicated interactions with other ozone @-@ depleting chemicals , are understood to result in degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised . It has been pointed out that other , lower @-@ flying , airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere , but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted . The small fleet meant overall ozone @-@ layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible . In 1995 , David Fahey , of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States , warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce in a 2 per cent drop in global ozone levels , much higher than previously thought . Each 1 per cent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non @-@ melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent . Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel , as he believed , then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone @-@ destroying impact of supersonic transport . 
 Concorde 's technical leap forward boosted the public 's understanding of conflicts between technology and the environment as well as awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts . In France , the use of acoustic fencing alongside TGV tracks might not have been achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise . In the UK , the <unk> has issued tranquillity maps since 1990 . 
 Some sources say Concorde typically flew 17 miles per U.S. gallon ( 14 L / 100 km ; 20 mpg @-@ imp ) per passenger . 
 = = = Public perception = = = 
 Concorde was normally perceived as a privilege of the rich , but special circular or one @-@ way ( with return by other flight or ship ) charter flights were arranged to bring a trip within the means of moderately well @-@ off enthusiasts . 
 The aircraft was usually referred to by the British as simply " Concorde " . In France it was known as " le Concorde " due to " le " , the definite article , used in French grammar to introduce the name of a ship or aircraft , and the capital being used to distinguish a proper name from a common noun of the same spelling . In French , the common noun <unk> means " agreement , harmony , or peace " . Concorde 's pilots and British Airways in official publications often refer to Concorde both in the singular and plural as " she " or " her " . 
 As a symbol of national pride , an example from the BA fleet made occasional flypasts at selected Royal events , major air shows and other special occasions , sometimes in formation with the Red Arrows . On the final day of commercial service , public interest was so great that grandstands were erected at Heathrow Airport . Significant numbers of people attended the final landings ; the event received widespread media coverage . 
 In 2006 , 37 years after its first test flight , Concorde was announced the winner of the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum . A total of 212 @,@ 000 votes were cast with Concorde beating design icons such as the Mini , mini skirt , Jaguar E @-@ type , Tube map and the Supermarine Spitfire . 
 = = = Special missions = = = 
 Heads of France and the United Kingdom flew Concorde many times . Presidents Georges Pompidou , Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing and François Mitterrand regularly used Concorde as French flagman aircraft in foreign visits . Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Ministers Edward Heath , Jim Callaghan , Margaret Thatcher , John Major , Tony Blair took Concorde in some charter flights such as the Queen 's trips to Barbados on her Silver Jubilee in 1977 , in 1987 and in 2003 , to Middle East in 1984 and to the United States in 1991 . 
 Pope John Paul II flew on Concorde in May 1989 . The British Prime Minister flew in a British Airways Concorde ( G @-@ BOAC ) to San Juan for the second G @-@ 6 Economic Summit , held in the United States and hosted by President Gerald Ford at the Dorado Beach Hotel in Dorado , Puerto Rico on 27 – 28 June 1976 . 
 Concorde sometimes made special flights for demonstrations , air shows ( such as the Farnborough , Paris @-@ <unk> and MAKS air shows ) as well as parades and celebrations ( for example , of Zürich airport 's anniversary in 1998 ) . The aircraft were also used for private charters ( including by the President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko on multiple occasions ) , for advertising companies ( including for the firm <unk> ) , for Olympic torch relays ( 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville ) and for observing solar eclipses .

 The fastest transatlantic airliner flight was from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 7 February 1996 by the British Airways G @-@ BOAD in 2 hours , 52 minutes , 59 seconds from take @-@ off to touchdown aided by a 175 mph ( 282 km / h ) tailwind . On 13 February 1985 , a Concorde charter flight flew from London Heathrow to Sydney — on the opposite side of the world — in a time of 17 hours , 3 minutes and 45 seconds , including refuelling stops . 
 Concorde also set other records , including the official FAI " Westbound Around the World " and " Eastbound Around the World " world air speed records . On 12 – 13 October 1992 , in commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus ’ first New World landing , Concorde Spirit Tours ( US ) chartered Air France Concorde F @-@ BTSD and circumnavigated the world in 32 hours 49 minutes and 3 seconds , from Lisbon , Portugal , including six refuelling stops at Santo Domingo , Acapulco , Honolulu , Guam , Bangkok , and Bahrain . 
 The eastbound record was set by the same Air France Concorde ( F @-@ BTSD ) under charter to Concorde Spirit Tours in the US on 15 – 16 August 1995 . This promotional flight circumnavigated the world from New York / JFK International Airport in 31 hours 27 minutes 49 seconds , including six refuelling stops at Toulouse , Dubai , Bangkok , Andersen AFB in Guam , Honolulu , and Acapulco . By its 30th flight anniversary on 2 March 1999 Concorde had clocked up 920 @,@ 000 flight hours , with more than 600 @,@ 000 supersonic , many more than all of the other supersonic aircraft in the Western world combined . 
 On its way to the Museum of Flight in November 2003 , G @-@ BOAG set a New York City @-@ to @-@ Seattle speed record of 3 hours , 55 minutes , and 12 seconds .

 = Project A119 = 
 Project A119 , also known as " A Study of Lunar Research Flights " , was a top @-@ secret plan developed in 1958 by the United States Air Force . The aim of the project was to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and <unk> . Had the explosive device not entered into a lunar crater , the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye , a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States , a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project . 
 The project was never carried out , being cancelled primarily out of a fear of a negative public reaction , with the potential militarization of space that it would also have signified , and because a moon landing would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement in the eyes of the American and international public alike . A similar project by the Soviet Union also never came to fruition . 
 The existence of the US project was revealed in 2000 by a former executive at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , Leonard Reiffel , who led the project in 1958 . A young Carl Sagan was part of the team responsible for predicting the effects of a nuclear explosion in vacuum and low gravity and in evaluating the scientific value of the project . The project documents remained secret for nearly 45 years , and despite Reiffel 's revelations , the United States government has never officially recognized its involvement in the study . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the Cold War , the Soviet Union took the lead in the Space Race with the launch of Sputnik 1 on October 4 , 1957 . Sputnik was the first artificial satellite in orbit around the Earth , and the surprise of its successful launch , compounded by the resounding failure of Project Vanguard to launch an American satellite after two attempts , has been dubbed the " Sputnik crisis " and was the impetus for the beginning of the Space Race . Trying to reclaim lost ground , the United States embarked on a series of new projects and studies , which eventually included the launch of Explorer 1 and the creation of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) and NASA . 
 = = Project = = 
 In 1949 , the Armour Research Foundation ( ARF ) , based at the Illinois Institute of Technology , began studying the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment . These studies would continue until 1962 . In May 1958 , ARF began covertly researching the potential consequences of an atomic explosion on the Moon . The main objective of the program , which ran under the auspices of the United States Air Force , which had initially proposed it , was to cause a nuclear explosion that would be visible from Earth . It was hoped that such a display would boost the morale of the American people . 
 At the time of the project 's conception , newspapers were reporting a rumor that the Soviet Union was planning to detonate a hydrogen bomb on the Moon . According to press reports in late 1957 , an anonymous source had divulged to a United States Secret Service agent that the Soviets planned to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution by causing a nuclear explosion on the Moon to coincide with a lunar eclipse on November 7 . News reports of the rumored launch included mention of targeting the dark side of the terminator — Project A119 would also consider this boundary as the target for an explosion . It was also reported that a failure to hit the Moon would likely result in the missile returning to Earth . 
 A similar idea had been put forward by Edward Teller , the " father of the H @-@ bomb " , who , in February 1957 , proposed the detonation of atomic devices both on and some distance from the lunar surface to analyze the effects of the explosion . 
 = = = Research = = = 
 A ten @-@ member team led by Leonard Reiffel was assembled at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago to study the potential visibility of the explosion , benefits to science , and implications for the lunar surface . Among the members of the research team were astronomer Gerard Kuiper and his doctoral student Carl Sagan , who was responsible for the mathematical projection of the expansion of a dust cloud in space around the Moon , an essential element in determining its visibility from Earth . 
 Scientists initially considered using a hydrogen bomb for the project , but the United States Air Force vetoed this idea due to the weight of such a device , as it would be too heavy to be propelled by the missile which would have been used . It was then decided to use a W25 warhead , a small , lightweight warhead with a relatively low 1 @.@ 7 kiloton yield . By contrast , the Little Boy bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of some 13 – 18 kilotons . The W25 would be carried by a rocket toward the unlit side of the Moon , near the terminator , where it would detonate on impact . The dust cloud resulting from the explosion would be lit by the Sun and therefore visible from Earth . According to Reiffel , the Air Force 's progress in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles would have made such a launch feasible by 1959 . 
 = = = Cancellation = = = 
 The project was eventually canceled by the Air Force in January 1959 , seemingly out of fear of a negative public reaction and the risk to the population should anything have gone wrong with the launch . Another factor , cited by project leader Leonard Reiffel , was the possible implications of the nuclear fallout for future lunar research projects and colonization . 
 Later reports show that a corresponding Soviet project did indeed exist , but differed from the scenario reported in the press . Started in January 1958 , it was part of a series of proposals under the codename " E " . Project E @-@ 1 entailed plans to reach the Moon , while projects E @-@ 2 and E @-@ 3 involved sending a probe around the far side of the Moon to take a series of photographs of its surface . The final stage of the project , E @-@ 4 , was to be a nuclear strike on the Moon as a display of force . As with the American plan , the E series of projects was canceled while still in its planning stages due to concerns regarding the safety and reliability of the launch vehicle . 
 = = Consequences = = 
 The signing of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 and the Outer Space Treaty in 1967 prevented future exploration of the concept of detonating a nuclear device on the Moon . However , by this time both the United States and the Soviet Union had performed several high @-@ altitude nuclear explosions , including those of Operation Hardtack I , Operation Argus , Operation Dominic I and II , and The K Project . 
 By 1969 , the United States had achieved a considerable victory in the Space Race after the success of the Apollo 11 mission . In December that year , Apollo scientist Gary Latham suggested detonating a " smallish " nuclear device on the Moon in order to facilitate research into its geologic make @-@ up . The idea was dismissed , however , as it would interfere with plans to measure the Moon 's natural background radiation . 
 The existence of Project A119 remained largely secret until the mid @-@ 1990s , when writer Keay Davidson discovered the story while researching the life of Carl Sagan for a biography . Sagan 's involvement with the project was apparent from his application for an academic scholarship at the University of California , Berkeley 's Miller Institute in 1959 . In the application , Sagan gave details of the project research , which Davidson felt constituted a violation of national security . The leak consisted of Sagan revealing the titles of two classified papers from the A119 project — the 1958 paper Possible Contribution of Lunar Nuclear Weapons Detonations to the Solution of Some Problems in Planetary Astronomy , and the 1959 paper Radiological Contamination of the Moon by Nuclear Weapons Detonations . A 1958 paper titled Cosmic Radiation and Lunar Radioactivity , credited to I. <unk> , was also named by Sagan in a 1961 paper written for the United States National Research Council . These were among the eight reports created by the project , all of which were destroyed in 1987 . 
 The resulting biography — Carl Sagan : A Life — was published in 1999 . Shortly after , a review published in Nature highlighted the discovery of the leaked information . This led Reiffel to break his anonymity and write a letter to the journal confirming that Sagan 's activity had at the time been considered a breach in the confidentiality of the project . Reiffel took the opportunity to reveal details of the studies , and his statements would later be widely reported in the media . Reiffel 's public admission of the project was accompanied by his denouncement of the work carried out , with the scientist noting that he was " horrified that such a gesture to sway public opinion was ever considered " . 
 As a result of the publicity the correspondence created , a freedom of information request was lodged concerning Project A119 . It was only then that A Study of Lunar Research Flights – Volume I was made public , over forty years after its inception . A search for the other volumes of documentation , however , revealed that other reports were destroyed in the 1980s by the Illinois Institute of Technology . 
 Dr. David Lowry , a nuclear historian from the United Kingdom , has called the project 's proposals " obscene " , adding " had they gone ahead , we would never have had the romantic image of Neil Armstrong taking " one giant leap for mankind " . " 
 = = Explosions in lunar science = = 
 A vacuum stable chemical explosive filled the seismic source mortar ammunition canisters used as part of the Apollo Lunar Active Seismic Experiments . These explosive experiments investigated the composition of the Lunar mantle during the Apollo Program , analogous to the exploration geophysics practice of mineral prospecting with chemical explosives in " deep seismic sounding " reflection seismology . 
 The scientific objectives of Project A119 would have been the detonating of a " smallish " nuclear device ( 1700 + tons of TNT ) on the Moon in order to facilitate research into its geologic make @-@ up " . This could have been attempted by non @-@ nuclear means , for example , using the much lower yield explosion created by the water prospecting Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) mission , which was launched in 2009 and released the " Centaur " kinetic energy impactor , with a mass of 2 @,@ 305 kilograms ( 5 @,@ 082 lb ) and an impact velocity of about 9 @,@ 000 km / h ( 5 @,@ 600 mph ) . 
 The question of if LCROSS would find water had been stated to be influential in whether or not the United States government pursues creating a Moon base . On November 13 , 2009 , NASA confirmed that water was detected after the Centaur impacted the crater . The LCROSS " Centaur " kinetic energy impactor was however underpowered and therefore only partially successful , having not produced the expected earth visible flash , nor succeeding in excavating and vaporizing enough subsurface material for a complete lunar soil spectral analysis , that would identify the lunar soil composition to a high depth . 
 = Adrift ( Stargate Atlantis ) = 
 " Adrift " is the 61st episode and the fourth season premiere of the science fiction television series Stargate Atlantis . The episode first aired in the United States on September 28 , 2007 on the Sci Fi Channel , and subsequently aired October 9 on Sky One in the United Kingdom . It was written by executive producer Martin Gero , and directed by Martin Wood . The episode continues from the third season finale " First Strike " , where Atlantis drops out of hyperspace in the middle of deep space with 24 hours of power left after an Asuran attack . 
 " Adrift " was a visual effects milestone for the series . It introduced several cast changes for the season , including the departure of Carson Beckett ( Paul McGillion ) and Elizabeth Weir ( Torri Higginson ) , and the inclusion of Samantha Carter ( Amanda Tapping ) to the main cast . Before its release , an incomplete version of the episode was leaked on the Internet . After its release , " Adrift " started the season with a drop in ratings since the last season finale . The episode earned the series Emmy and Visual Effects Society Award nominations , and was generally well received . 
 = = Plot = = 
 With Weir ( Torri Higginson ) incapacitated , Sheppard ( Joe Flanigan ) is forced to take command of Atlantis . McKay ( David Hewlett ) determines that the power conduits are damaged , preventing Atlantis from completing its jump to the planet M12 @-@ 578 . While teams are sent to patch them up , the shield starts to collapse , resulting in the deaths of one team . McKay later decides to collapse the shield to cover the central tower in order to conserve power , and give Zelenka ( David Nykl ) time to patch up the conduits . However , the city approaches an asteroid belt , and the only way to go through without using up the power is for Sheppard to lead a fleet of Puddle Jumpers and clear a path . Although inexperienced , the pilots succeed , but impacts from the stragglers damage the stardrive control crystals , and they have to fix it before jumping again . 
 In the midway station , Colonel Carter ( Amanda Tapping ) and Bill Lee ( Bill Dow ) are contacted by the Apollo , informing them Atlantis did not arrive . Carter and Lee eventually decide to find the city by using the Apollo to perform small jumps along the city 's path and augment their sensors to increase the chance of finding Atlantis . Dr. Keller ( Jewel Staite ) exhausts her medical expertise to save Weir , and asks McKay to <unk> the nanites Weir was infected with in " The Real World " . Against Sheppard 's orders , McKay goes ahead with it . 
 In space suits , Sheppard and Zelenka reach the controls and repair them , but in the process Zelenka is injured by a micro @-@ asteroid . By then , Atlantis has lost too much power to jump again . Furthermore , Sheppard learns McKay has disobeyed his order and angrily tells him to deactivate the nanites . Weir , having apparently fully recovered , regains consciousness . When she learns the nanites are keeping her alive , she warns Teyla ( Rachel Luttrell ) that saving her this way is a bad idea . McKay apologises to Sheppard , and they continue working . In the end , McKay decides to use an experimental Jumper with a hyperdrive he worked on since " Tao of Rodney " and use it to steal a Zero Point Module from the Asuran homeworld .

 " Adrift " first surfaced on February 2007 , before the airing of " First Strike " . By March it was confirmed to be the first of a two @-@ part opening for the fourth season along with " Lifeline " and would be similar in style to " Progeny " and " The Real World " . The producers kept trying to find new ways to " out @-@ do " the efforts of the previous seasons , which they described was " different " to them , since they introduced more of a balance between team @-@ based and character @-@ based episodes . After the completion of " First Strike " , the producers thought it was the biggest episode they have ever done , and wondered how the fourth season would top that . During the writing stages , Martin Gero wanted the episode to " tee up " with the last episode of the season , and hence wanted the episode to become part of a story @-@ arc for the entire season . Gero also wanted the episode to have " no down time " for the characters like the previous season premieres . After Zelenka gets injured , a scene where a Puddle Jumper was originally meant to pick them both up . However , having a Jumper set nearby in an Atlantis set would not be practical enough , and was cut . He also wrote to have Sheppard in an <unk> state while forced to take command of Atlantis . The scene where McKay and Zelenka converse and finish each other 's sentences were parallel to the arguing between Gero and Wood while working together on set . He considered the scene between Teyla and Weir to be the cliffhanger , but was changed to the following scene , as Gero felt that would be the better cliffhanger , similar to the one for " The Return , Part 1 " . 
 The episode , and the season itself has introduced Amanda Tapping as Samantha Carter for her first of 14 episode appearance , after finishing her appearances on all ten seasons of the sister series , Stargate SG @-@ 1 . Carter would replace Elizabeth Weir as the leader of the Atlantis Expedition after the episode . However , Carter would only have a supporting role as opposed to a lead role on SG @-@ 1 . The episode would also give the audience " an opportunity to really get to know Dr. Jennifer Keller " ( Staite ) . Gero was reluctant to accept an updated opening title sequence , which mentioned the departure of Weir and the introduction of Carter , which would give the casual viewers a tip . 
 While filming the scene where Keller and her team perform a <unk> craniectomy on Weir , an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away , and directed the cast on what to do . While following the surgeon , Staite was nervous about doing the scene . After filming was completed , the surgeon 's voice was removed from the final cut . During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field , the producers wanted the scene where Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible , so in the control room , not only the cameras , but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well . 
 The episode was one of the most expensive in the series at the time , with two visual effects milestones for the series . During one of the sequences , the visual effects team switched from stock explosions on 2D to 3D versions . The producers wished to exceed the minute @-@ long Horizon sequence in the previous episode . The scene where the doors close while the shield is collapsing was merely stock footage from " Hot Zone " , with the CGI of the shield added on . When the producers conceived the idea for the space jump between Sheppard and Zelenka , they thought it would be " cool " , as well as thinking that they were possibly too apprehensive . However , the sequence was pulled off , and Paul Mullie described the jump as " one of the best visual effects we have ever done . " The scene were one team dies from the collapsing shield however , was not performed as well as the producers hoped . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Before the episode originally aired , a near @-@ complete version was leaked onto the Internet . After it aired in the United States , " Adrift " earned a 1 @.@ 2 household Nielsen rating , representing 1 @.@ 7 million viewers ; 896 @,@ 000 from ages 18 to 49 , and 962 @,@ 000 from the 25 to 54 demographic . The episode decreased viewership by six percent from the average ratings from the back half of the third season , and dropped from a 1 @.@ 5 household rating from the third season premiere , " No Man 's Land " . The reasoning may be the fact that several well @-@ known series aired on the same time slot . However , according to the Live + 3 Day rating , the ratings boosted to 1 @.@ 4 . In the United Kingdom , " Adrift " received 527 @,@ 000 viewers , placing Atlantis number six in the top ten broadcasts for Sky One for that week . 
 Tory Ireland Mell of IGN thought the season premiere performed well without Stargate SG @-@ 1 , and liked the episode 's visual effects sequences and action , but was critical about the lack of Ronon 's presence after his injury in the last episode , giving " Adrift " a " descent " rating of 7 @.@ 0 out of 10 . Critical Myth rated the episode 8 out of 10 , praising the direction the writers took with the episode , Sheppard being rather forced to be command of the city with the incapacitation of Weir , as well as comparing the characters ' " chance to prove their meddle through extreme adversity " to " The Siege , Part 2 " . Joe Flanigan ( who plays John Sheppard ) described this and the following episode as " fun to do , " and praised the idea of Atlantis being marooned in space , and wished the arc would last " seven or eight " episodes . " Adrift " was nominated for two awards . In 2008 , the visual effects team submitted " Adrift " for a " Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects " , but lost to Battlestar Galactica 's " He That Believeth in Me " . The episode was also nominated for the sixth annual Visual Effects Society Award for " Outstanding Visual Effects in a Broadcast Series " , but lost to Fight for Life . 
 = Ekbletomys = 
 " Ekbletomys hypenemus " is an extinct oryzomyine rodent from the islands of Antigua and Barbuda , Lesser Antilles . It was described as the only species of the subgenus " Ekbletomys " of genus Oryzomys in a 1962 Ph.D. thesis , but that name is not available under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and the species remains formally unnamed . It is currently referred to as " Ekbletomys hypenemus " in the absence of a formally available name . The species is now thought to be extinct , but association with introduced Rattus indicates that it survived until after 1500 CE on Antigua . 
 It is known from abundant skeletal elements , which document it as the largest known oryzomyine , on par with Megalomys desmarestii , another Antillean endemic . Its morphological features indicate that it is distinct from Megalomys , which includes various other Antillean oryzomyines , and derives from a separate colonization of the Lesser Antilles by oryzomyines . In the original description , it was placed close to a species now placed in Nephelomys , but its relationships have not been studied since . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Remains of " Ekbletomys " were first found on Barbuda in the summer of 1958 and subsequently on Antigua in 1961 . In his 1962 Ph.D. thesis at Harvard University , paleontologist Clayton E. Ray described them as a new species , Oryzomys hypenemus , which he considered distinctive enough to merit its own subgenus , Ekbletomys . The specific name , hypenemus , is derived from <unk> ( <unk> ) , which means " leeward " in Ancient Greek and refers to the species ' distribution in the Leeward Islands , and the subgeneric name , Ekbletomys , combines Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) " cast up " and μυς ( mus ) " mouse " , referring to the way " Ekbletomys " probably reached its islands . Because Ray 's thesis does not meet the definition of a " published work " in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , both new names proposed by Ray are not available and cannot be used in formal zoological nomenclature . The name has rarely been used in the literature on Antillean oryzomyines since , and no formal description has been published ; thus , the animal still lacks a formally available name . 
 Large oryzomyines from Antigua and Barbuda have been reported in several subsequent studies , but these did not explicitly refer the material to Ray 's " Oryzomys hypenemus " . New material has come from Indian Creek and Burma 's Quarry on Antigua and from Indiantown Trail and Sufferers on Barbuda . These studies referred the Antigua and Barbuda material to " <unk> species B " , which is also known from archeological material on Guadeloupe , Montserrat and Marie @-@ Galante . In addition to this large species , other , smaller oryzomyines may also have occurred on Antigua ; two species of oryzomyine were also formerly present on Barbuda . 
 = = Description = = 
 " Ekbletomys " is known from numerous bones from Barbuda , including over a hundred femora and <unk> ( bones of the hindlimb ) , four substantial cranium ( skull ) fragments , one of which was designated by Ray as the holotype , and various others . At the time of Ray 's writing , the material from Antigua had not yet been completely sorted out , and consequently the description is based mainly on specimens from Barbuda . 
 The Barbudan material , and particularly the skulls , shows a number of features distinctive enough for an oryzomyine to persuade Ray to allocate it to its own subgenus and species . The front part of the skull is short and broad . The interorbital region of the skull ( located between the eyes ) is narrower than that of any other oryzomyine . The squamosal ( back ) roots of the zygomatic arches ( cheekbones ) are oriented perpendicular to the main axis of the skull . The incisive foramina ( openings in the palate between the incisors and the molars ) are extremely short . The molars are large . The palate is short , extending barely beyond the third molar . The anterocone ( front cusp ) of the first upper molar is divided by a marked anteromedian flexus . The length of the holotype skull is larger than that of all specimens but one of Megalomys desmarestii , indicating that " Ekbletomys " is among the largest oryzomyine species known . 
 As " Ekbletomys " and Megalomys audreyae are from the same island , a close relation between the two would be expected , but the two differ so much that Ray declared any special relationship between the genus Megalomys and " Ekbletomys " to be " out of the question " . In all measurements that could be examined , M. audreyae , which is known only from an upper incisor and a lower jaw with the first molar missing , falls far outside the range of variation of " Ekbletomys " and in addition , it differs in the shape of the folds of the molars , which are broader than in " Ekbletomys " , and in the more elongate form of the lower third molar . 
 More complete material is available for the two Megalomys species known to have survived into historic times , M. desmarestii and M. luciae . M. desmarestii is about as large as " Ekbletomys " and M. luciae is slightly smaller . In sharp contrast to the relatively narrow interorbital in " Ekbletomys " , these two taxa show a very broad interorbital . Also , " Ekbletomys " shows a relatively large zygomatic breadth of the skull , whereas the relative value is at the lower end of the variation among oryzomyines in Megalomys . The <unk> process of the squamosal bone is much longer and more slender in " Ekbletomys . Megalomys also has relatively short incisive foramina , but not nearly as short as those in " Ekbletomys " . Although overall skull length is about equal in both species , molars of Megalomys are smaller than those of " Ekbletomys " and incisors are larger , reflecting relatively large molars and slender incisors in " Ekbletomys " and the reverse in Megalomys . 
 Ray considered " Ekbletomys " to be most closely related to Oryzomys <unk> , a species which at the time encompassed virtually all forms now placed in the genus Nephelomys . The two agree in their robust skull with short incisive foramina , a broad braincase , a similarly formed interorbital , supraorbital crests situated close together near the middle of the skull , and presence of an anteromedian flexus on the upper first molar . Ray suggested that the origin of " Ekbletomys " lies in a continental ancestor similar to Nephelomys . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 " Ekbletomys hypenemus " is known from material from two small limestone caves at Two Foot Bay at the eastern side of the island of Barbuda , Antigua and Barbuda and from a site named Mill Reef in the far east of Antigua , also in Antigua and Barbuda , which has not been described in detail . In both Barbuda caves , the " Ekbletomys " material was found in red to yellow unconsolidated sediments on the cave floor which were partially overlain by a darker sediment that yielded the introduced Rattus , indicating deposition after the first European contact around 1500 . These sediments are probably ancient owl pellets deposited by a burrowing owl ( Athene <unk> ) and they also yielded the frog Eleutherodactylus <unk> ; the lizards <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Anolis <unk> ; the birds Puffinus <unk> , Zenaida <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> bicolor , and an unidentified <unk> ; and the bats <unk> blainvillei , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> brasiliensis , and <unk> <unk> . The deposits that included " Ekbletomys " are probably very late Quaternary , but pre @-@ Columbian , and the Antigua material ranges in age from about 2500 BCE to post @-@ Columbian . 
 In order to colonize Barbuda and Antigua , " Ekbletomys " must have reached the islands through overwater dispersal , probably by means of rafting . Ray thought it improbable that the ancestor of the animal reached the islands through repeated overwater dispersal ( island hopping ) from mainland South America along the Lesser Antilles all the way to Barbuda . Even when sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene , the animal would still have been required to overcome seven water barriers , a series of voyages " no less wondrous than those of <unk> . " Instead , he argued that the animal reached the islands directly on a raft from mainland South America , probably from one of the continent 's large rivers . 
 = Shielded metal arc welding = 
 Shielded metal arc welding ( SMAW ) , also known as manual metal arc welding ( MMA or <unk> ) , flux shielded arc welding or informally as stick welding , is a manual arc welding process that uses a consumable electrode covered with a flux to lay the weld . 
 An electric current , in the form of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply , is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined . The workpiece and the electrode melts forming the weld pool that cools to form a joint . As the weld is laid , the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates , giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag , both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination . 
 Because of the versatility of the process and the simplicity of its equipment and operation , shielded metal arc welding is one of the world 's first and most popular welding processes . It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry , and though flux @-@ cored arc welding is growing in popularity , SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication . The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels ( including stainless steel ) but aluminium , nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method . 
 = = Development = = 
 After the discovery of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov , there was little development in electrical welding until Auguste de <unk> developed a carbon arc torch that was patented in 1881 . 
 In 1885 , Nikolay <unk> and Stanisław Olszewski developed carbon arc welding , obtaining American patents from 1887 showing a rudimentary electrode holder . In 1888 , the consumable metal electrode was invented by Nikolay Slavyanov . Later in 1890 , C. L. Coffin received U.S. Patent 428 @,@ 459 for his arc welding method that utilized a metal electrode . The process , like SMAW , deposited melted electrode metal into the weld as filler . 
 Around 1900 , A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg released the first coated electrodes . Strohmenger used clay and lime coating to stabilize the arc , while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the electrode . In 1912 , Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode , but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity . In 1927 , the development of an extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications . In the 1950s , manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating , making it possible to increase the welding speed . 
 In 1938 K. K. Madsen described an automated variation of SMAW , now known as gravity welding . It briefly gained popularity in the 1960s after receiving publicity for its use in Japanese shipyards though today its applications are limited . Another little used variation of the process , known as firecracker welding , was developed around the same time by George <unk> in Austria . 
 = = Operation = = 
 To strike the electric arc , the electrode is brought into contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly . This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode , and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool . Striking an arc , which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition , can be the hardest skill for beginners . The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble , if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stuck which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly . The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece , which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc . As the electrode melts , the flux covering disintegrates , giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases . In addition , the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool . Once part of the weld pool , the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies . Once hardened , it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld . As welding progresses and the electrode melts , the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder . This activity , combined with chipping away the slag , reduces the amount of time that the welder can spend laying the weld , making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes . In general , the operator factor , or the percentage of operator 's time spent laying weld , is approximately 25 % . 
 The actual welding technique utilized depends on the electrode , the composition of the workpiece , and the position of the joint being welded . The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the welding speed . Flat welds require the least operator skill , and can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly . This permits higher welding speeds . 
 Sloped , vertical or upside @-@ down welding requires more operator skill , and often necessitates the use of an electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the molten metal from flowing out of the weld pool . However , this generally means that the electrode melts less quickly , thus increasing the time required to lay the weld . 
 = = = Quality = = = 
 The most common quality problems associated with SMAW include weld spatter , porosity , poor fusion , shallow penetration , and cracking . 
 Weld spatter , while not affecting the integrity of the weld , damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs . It can be caused by excessively high current , a long arc , or arc blow , a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces . Arc blow can also cause porosity in the weld , as can joint contamination , high welding speed , and a long welding arc , especially when low @-@ hydrogen electrodes are used . 
 <unk> , often not visible without the use of advanced nondestructive testing methods , is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld . Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion , though it is often easily visible . It is caused by low current , contaminated joint surfaces , or the use of an improper electrode . 
 Shallow penetration , another detriment to weld strength , can be addressed by decreasing welding speed , increasing the current or using a smaller electrode . Any of these weld @-@ strength @-@ related defects can make the weld prone to cracking , but other factors are involved as well . High carbon , alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking , especially if low @-@ hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed . Furthermore , the workpieces should not be excessively restrained , as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts . 
 = = = Safety = = = 
 SMAW welding , like other welding methods , can be a dangerous and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken . The process uses an open electric arc , which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets . Additionally , the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye , in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes . Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure , and in recent years , new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self @-@ darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light . To protect bystanders , especially in industrial environments , translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area . These curtains , made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film , shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc , but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets . 
 In addition , the vaporizing metal and flux materials expose welders to dangerous gases and particulate matter . The smoke produced contains particles of various types of oxides . The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes , with smaller particles presenting a greater danger . Additionally , gases like carbon dioxide and ozone can form , which can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate . Some of the latest welding masks are fitted with an electric powered fan to help disperse harmful fumes .

 Shielded metal arc welding is one of the world 's most popular welding processes , accounting for over half of all welding in some countries . Because of its versatility and simplicity , it is particularly dominant in the maintenance and repair industry , and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication . In recent years its use has declined as flux @-@ cored arc welding has expanded in the construction industry and gas metal arc welding has become more popular in industrial environments . However , because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability , the process will likely remain popular , especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary . 
 SMAW is often used to weld carbon steel , low and high alloy steel , stainless steel , cast iron , and ductile iron . While less popular for nonferrous materials , it can be used on nickel and copper and their alloys and , in rare cases , on aluminium . The thickness of the material being welded is bounded on the low end primarily by the skill of the welder , but rarely does it drop below 1 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 06 in ) . No upper bound exists : with proper joint preparation and use of multiple passes , materials of virtually unlimited thicknesses can be joined . Furthermore , depending on the electrode used and the skill of the welder , SMAW can be used in any position . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 Shielded metal arc welding equipment typically consists of a constant current welding power supply and an electrode , with an electrode holder , a ' ground ' clamp , and welding cables ( also known as welding leads ) connecting the two . 
 = = = Power supply = = = 
 The power supply used in SMAW has constant current output , ensuring that the current ( and thus the heat ) remains relatively constant , even if the arc distance and voltage change . This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual , requiring that an operator hold the torch . Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead , since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult . However , because the current is not maintained absolutely constant , skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor fluctuations in the current . 
 The preferred polarity of the SMAW system depends primarily upon the electrode being used and the desired properties of the weld . Direct current with a negatively charged electrode ( DCEN ) causes heat to build up on the electrode , increasing the electrode melting rate and decreasing the depth of the weld . Reversing the polarity so that the electrode is positively charged ( DCEP ) and the workpiece is negatively charged increases the weld penetration . With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second , creating an even heat distribution and providing a balance between electrode melting rate and penetration . 
 Typically , the equipment used for SMAW consists of a step @-@ down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier , which converts alternating current into direct current . Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high @-@ voltage alternating current , the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current . As a result , instead of 220 V at 50 A , for example , the power supplied by the transformer is around 17 – 45 V at currents up to 600 A. A number of different types of transformers can be used to produce this effect , including multiple coil and inverter machines , with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current . The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil ( in tap @-@ type transformers ) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils ( in movable coil or movable core transformers ) . <unk> , which are smaller and thus more portable , use electronic components to change the current characteristics . 
 Electrical generators and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies , but because of lower efficiency and greater costs , they are less frequently used in industry . Maintenance also tends to be more difficult , because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source . However , in one sense they are simpler : the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC . However , the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed . 
 In some units the alternator is essentially the same as that used in portable generating sets used to supply mains power , modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60 Hz grid frequency . In higher @-@ quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency , such as 400 Hz . The smaller amount of time the high @-@ frequency waveform spends near zero makes it much easier to strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid @-@ frequency sets or grid @-@ frequency mains @-@ powered units . 
 = = = Electrode = = = 
 The choice of electrode for SMAW depends on a number of factors , including the weld material , welding position and the desired weld properties . The electrode is coated in a metal mixture called flux , which gives off gases as it decomposes to prevent weld contamination , introduces deoxidizers to purify the weld , causes weld @-@ protecting slag to form , improves the arc stability , and provides alloying elements to improve the weld quality . Electrodes can be divided into three groups — those designed to melt quickly are called " fast @-@ fill " electrodes , those designed to solidify quickly are called " fast @-@ freeze " electrodes , and intermediate electrodes go by the name " fill @-@ freeze " or " fast @-@ follow " electrodes . Fast @-@ fill electrodes are designed to melt quickly so that the welding speed can be maximized , while fast @-@ freeze electrodes supply filler metal that solidifies quickly , making welding in a variety of positions possible by preventing the weld pool from shifting significantly before solidifying . 
 The composition of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical to that of the base material . But even though a number of feasible options exist , a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld . This is especially true of alloy steels such as <unk> steels . Likewise , electrodes of compositions similar to those of the base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper . However , sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material . For example , stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel , and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces . 
 Electrode coatings can consist of a number of different compounds , including rutile , calcium fluoride , cellulose , and iron powder . <unk> electrodes , coated with 25 % – 45 % TiO2 , are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld . However , they create welds with high hydrogen content , encouraging embrittlement and cracking . Electrodes containing calcium fluoride ( CaF2 ) , sometimes known as basic or low @-@ hydrogen electrodes , are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions . They produce strong welds , but with a coarse and convex @-@ shaped joint surface . Electrodes coated with cellulose , especially when combined with rutile , provide deep weld penetration , but because of their high moisture content , special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking . Finally , iron powder is a common coating additive that increases the rate at which the electrode fills the weld joint , up to twice as fast . 
 To identify different electrodes , the American Welding Society established a system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five @-@ digit number . Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E , followed by their number . The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal , in thousand pounds per square inch ( ksi ) . The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode , typically using the values 1 ( normally fast @-@ freeze electrodes , implying all position welding ) and 2 ( normally fast @-@ fill electrodes , implying horizontal welding only ) . The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together . When applicable , a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode . 
 Common electrodes include the <unk> , a fast @-@ freeze , all @-@ position electrode with a minimum tensile strength of 60 ksi ( 410 MPa ) which is operated using DCEP . <unk> is similar except its flux coating allows it to be used with alternating current in addition to DCEP . <unk> is a fast @-@ fill electrode , used primarily to make flat or horizontal welds using AC , DCEN , or DCEP . Examples of fill @-@ freeze electrodes are the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , all of which provide a compromise between fast welding speeds and all @-@ position welding . 
 = = = Process variations = = = 
 Though SMAW is almost exclusively a manual arc welding process , one notable process variation exists , known as gravity welding or gravity arc welding . It serves as an automated version of the traditional shielded metal arc welding process , employing an electrode holder attached to an inclined bar along the length of the weld . Once started , the process continues until the electrode is spent , allowing the operator to manage multiple gravity welding systems . The electrodes employed ( often <unk> or <unk> ) are coated heavily in flux , and are typically 71 cm ( 28 in ) in length and about 6 @.@ 35 mm ( 0 @.@ 25 in ) thick . As in manual SMAW , a constant current welding power supply is used , with either negative polarity direct current or alternating current . Due to a rise in the use of semiautomatic welding processes such as flux @-@ cored arc welding , the popularity of gravity welding has fallen as its economic advantage over such methods is often minimal . Other SMAW @-@ related methods that are even less frequently used include firecracker welding , an automatic method for making butt and fillet welds , and massive electrode welding , a process for welding large components or structures that can deposit up to 27 kg ( 60 lb ) of weld metal per hour . 
 = Broken Sword : The Sleeping Dragon = 
 Broken Sword : The Sleeping Dragon is an adventure game released on Windows , Xbox , and PlayStation 2 in 2003 , while in Japan , the PlayStation 2 version ( released only in Europe and Japan ) was released in September 2004 . A Nintendo GameCube version was planned , but was cancelled . It is the third instalment in the Broken Sword series , released six years after the previous instalment , The Smoking Mirror . The Sleeping Dragon moved the series to 3D graphics , and is the only game in the series not to use a point and click interface . The player assumes the role of George Stobbart , an American patent lawyer who flies to the Congo to write a patent for a scientist who claims to have found a source of unlimited energy . 
 The idea was first discussed in 2000 . To make the game feel like a film , Revolution brought in a cinematic consultant , Bob Keen , who made sure the game conveyed emotions and atmosphere appropriate for each scene . The game was originally planned to have similar cartoon @-@ quality visuals as its prequels , but the developers decided to aim at a style similar to Japanese animated films . Unlike the first two Broken Sword games , which used the Virtual Theatre engine , The Sleeping Dragon was built with the RenderWare engine . The game 's music was composed by Ben McCullough , and Rolf Saxon returned to voice George Stobbart . 
 The game has received highly positive reviews . Critics praised the game 's story , writing , humour , cinematic feel , and graphics . The game 's music was also lauded . Criticism focused primarily on the control interface and repetitive puzzles . According to Charles Cecil , the game sold a few hundred thousand copies . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay in Broken Sword : The Sleeping Dragon is a departure from previous instalments in the series , using a direct control interface . The player guides George Stobbart 's movements with a keyboard or gamepad , while Nicole Collard is also a playable character at certain times . George must collect objects that can be used with other collectable objects , parts of the scenery , or other people in the game world in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game . George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot . The player has action choices in the bottom right of the screen - there are four circles with anywhere from one to four actions available at any time ; the player selects the desired action with the corresponding key . As in the first two Broken Sword games , in The Sleeping Dragon player character death is possible . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Following the events in Smoking Mirror a few years ago , George Stobbart has returned to his life as a lawyer , and finds himself flying to the Congo Basin , alongside his pilot , Harry Gilligan , to meet a scientist by the name of <unk> , who claims to have created a machine that can make limitless energy . However , a storm forces the pair 's plane to crash land on a cliff @-@ top , right close to the scientist 's lab . Escaping the wreckage , George makes his way to the lab , arriving just in time to see the scientist gunned down by a pale , lanky man , known as Susarro , and his bodyguard , after being questioned on an unknown subject . A postcard hidden in the lab prompts George to travel to Glastonbury , England , to search for a man named Bruno , and a friend of the scientist , who had advised him to flee . In his attempts to find out where Bruno is , he quickly learns that he disappeared before his arrival and is now in danger . Although not knowing where he is exactly , after visiting a fortune teller , George spots a building that caught fire , and goes to deal with it , saving an old man trapped within it . When they chat , he quickly learns that the old man 's name is Bruno <unk> , the scientist he met in the Hotel Ubu in Paris , and a Neo @-@ Templar . Bruno reveals to George that he left the group after the events of Shadows of the Templar , and that they are now led by Susarro , who took over and renamed it the Cult of the Dragon . Susarro is seeking to gain immortality through the use of the Earth ’ s ley lines , which <unk> was using in his experiments , and Bruno explains that he is able to track these with a special device he has , believing Susarro may be going to a site in Paris to find something important , prompting the pair to follow after him . 
 During these events , in Paris , Nicole Collard prepares to meet and interview a hacker named Vernon <unk> in his apartment , who recently decoded the Voynich manuscript , but is afraid for his life because of what he found out from it . Unfortunately , Vernon is murdered in his home by a woman impersonating Nico , named Petra , just before the former gets there . When the two confront each other inside the apartment , Petra fails to kill Nico , and flees , leaving a few clues behind . Nico quickly tries to find what she needs to prove her innocence , but after the police arrive to investigate the murder , the detective in charge chooses to arrest her , based on the witness account of Vernon 's landlady . Following her arrest and subsequent release two days later , Nico decides to find out more about what Vernon had found out , and returns to his apartment , finding his girlfriend , Beatrice , residing inside , still coping with the loss of Vernon . Finding and managing to open a hidden safe , Nico finds diagrams and a DVD , with the latter she plays back at her own apartment before showing it to Andre Lobineau , an old friend of hers , finding it contained a message from Vernon about what he found , believing the bizarre storms happening across the world are a sign of a global catastrophe in the making . Finding out about an abandoned theatre on the Ile St Louis in Paris , connected to a mask the killer had with her when she fled Vernon 's murder , Nico heads out to investigate it but gets captured by Petra and her boss , Susarro . 
 Shortly afterwards , Bruno and George arrive at the same theatre , following Bruno 's device to an energy source he was tracing . George decides to break in , finding Susarro , Petra , and Flap ( who survived falling out of the train in Shadows of the Templars ) interrogating Nico about her investigations ; George quickly rescues her when Flap is left on his own with her , knocking him out in the process . After the pair reveal what led them to crossing paths with each other , they decide to continue searching the theatre , looking for the source of the energy Bruno detected . In the process , they find two keys - one in a safe , which is made of stone and decorated with crystals , and was the energy source Bruno detected , while the other , a stone , is found in a weird chamber , within a column of energy , bearing an omega symbol on it . Heading outside , after escaping from Susarro and Petra ( who had been dealing with a mysterious , hooded man ) , George is <unk> by an unknown assailant , who takes the strange energy key from him . 
 Back at Nico ’ s apartment , Bruno reveals that the stolen key was the Key of Solomon ; Susarro would need it to access a special armillary in an ancient building , the location of which is unknown . Whilst looking at the Omega Stone , George realises he saw the same symbol , in exactly the same style as the key , in the Congo , leading him and Nico to travel there and investigate . The pair quickly find another stone with the alpha symbol upon it , and manage to evade Petra , who had come after them and the site . Upon returning to Paris , the pair learn that Bruno had been captured whilst Nico 's apartment was ransacked , and taken to Prague , leaving Nico to find out where exactly by returning to the abandoned theatre and searching it for clues , quickly finding out that he was taken to a large castle owned by Susarro . Whilst there , they manage to track down Bruno , along with the discovery that the armillary is in Egypt , and that the Key of Solomon was taken by the St. Stefan chapter of the Knights Templar - a surviving remnant of the Templars that still exist , and known to Susarro . He promptly returns to Paris to confront them , while Bruno is taken to Egypt . George decides to track the St. Stefan chapter as well , and returns to Paris and the Montfauçon where they are based , only to arrive too late to stop their base being invaded . Despite finding bodies , George manages to find survivors of the attack , including the Preceptor for the chapter 's temple . The Preceptor tasks George with stopping Susarro , revealing the key was taken from them , before handing over a third stone key needed to pinpoint the armillary , bearing a psi symbol on it , and knighting George . 
 Locating the armillary building in Egypt with the three stone keys , George and Nico sneak into the building , only to see Susarro forcing Bruno to activate the armillary . As it powers up , George and Nico subdue Susarro , just before Petra arrives with a hooded man seen twice before during their adventure , who proceeds to kill Susarro with supernatural powers . The figure turns out to be the Grand Master of the Neo @-@ Templars , thought to have been killed back in Bannockburn , but had survived , having Petra work with Susarro until he learnt what the Grand Master needed . With the armillary active and the location of a large power site displayed , the Grand Master sets off dynamite in the building as he escapes with Petra , trapping George , Nico , and Bruno inside and killing Flap . The group find the only way for them to escape is for one of them to sacrifice themselves in one of the puzzle rooms , forcing Bruno to take the responsibility , hoping to atone for past sins so that George and Nico can stop the Grand Master . 
 George and Nico quickly arrive at the power site , which had been located in Glastonbury , as bad storms across the world begin to strike ; the town is badly flooded when they reach the area . As Nico confronts Petra , George tries to stop the Grand Master , arriving in time to see the Grand Master absorb the energy at the site , turning him into a dragon and causing the ground beneath them to collapse . George finds a sword in the cavern he lands in , which he uses to slay the dragon and save the world . As Nico arrives to congratulate him , Petra dying from the dragon 's death , George tosses the sword into the floodwaters , as the pair wonder how things will be in the future .

 Revolution first discussed the idea for the game in 2000 . At first , The Sleeping Dragon was planned to have similar cartoon @-@ quality visuals to the first two Broken Sword games ; however , Revolution decided not to use the " flat " look , claiming it lacked visual depth . The team wanted the game to look believable , but not necessarily realistic , similar to Japanese animated films . 
 Textures were hand drawn to achieve the " cartoon " look , while the light @-@ map employed radiosity to create realistic lighting . Advances in hardware plus the changes in methodology allowed the game to move to 24 @-@ bit colour . 
 Charles Cecil was the director of the game , and Tony Warriner was responsible for AI programming and some aspects of the game 's design . To make the game feel like a film , Revolution brought in a cinematic consultant , Bob Keen , who made sure the game conveyed emotions and atmosphere appropriate for each scene . The music in the game was composed by Ben McCullough . The voice recording was scheduled to take five days ; however , the entire process took four days . The voices were recorded with the voice actors together , enabling better acting and interaction . The full script is 6 @,@ 000 lines in total , similar to Broken Sword II . While Rolf Saxon returned to voice George Stobbart , Nicole " Nico " Collard was played by Sarah Crook . 
 Revolution held a casting session at a studio called The Spotlight ( in Leicester Square in London ) , in which multiple parts were auditioned for by multiple actors . Originally , Nico was planned to be voiced by a native French speaker , to get the right accent ; however , she ended up being voiced by Sarah Crook , a native English speaker . The rest of the credited voice actors were Alison Pettit , Andrew Secombe , Bob Golding , Jay Benedict , John Bull , Laurence Bouvard , Peter <unk> , Rachael Rogers , Rachel Preece , Simon Treves , and Seamus O 'Neil . 
 Cecil stated in an interview that the development costs were £ 2 million . Though the game made $ 40 million , as a developer Revolution suffered a massive loss . 
 Although the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions are no longer available , the PC version may be purchased from Steam , Mastertronic and GOG.com , and is also a part of the Broken Sword Complete package from Mastertronic .

Edge magazine gave the game a 9 , praising the storytelling , dialogues and visuals , and while pointing out some sporadic glitches that break the illusion Edge magazine refers to this game as " a fairytale comeback " and " the adventure 's glorious return " . IGN gave the game a rating of 8 @.@ 4 , placing it under the " Impressive " category , but noted that the interface was difficult to use and the puzzles in the game were repetitive . Adventure Gamers gave it 4 out of 5 stars , called it a " technical masterpiece " , and praised its cinematic introduction , cutscenes , lifelike character faces , and said " it certainly raise [ s ] the bar for any seen in adventures to this date " , but criticised its controls and repetitive puzzles . GameSpot had an overall positive review ; their Scott Osborne praised its plot , characters , and setting , and ( unlike most ) found the interface to have its points , although he was frustrated with times in which quick reflexes are required and bored ( like most ) with some of the puzzles ; he also ran into a sound problem , which does not appear to have happened to any other reviewer . Although Laura MacDonald of Mr. Bill 's Adventureland panned its repetitive puzzles , she called it an " instant classic " and praised its story , controls , characters and music . Steven Carter of Game Over Online was less positive ( criticising its plot , interface , and puzzles – calling most of the last " trivially easy " ) , but did praise its general appearance , voice acting , and music . Computer Games Magazine was less positive , mainly due to heavily criticising the interface .

 Juwan Antonio Howard ( born February 7 , 1973 ) is an American retired professional basketball player who currently serves as an assistant coach for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . Howard formerly played for the Heat from 2010 until 2013 . A one @-@ time All @-@ Star and one @-@ time All @-@ NBA power forward , he began his NBA career as the fifth overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft , selected by the Washington Bullets . Before he was drafted , he starred as an All @-@ American on the Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball team . At Michigan he was part of the Fab Five recruiting class of 1991 that reached the finals of the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Men 's Division I Basketball Championship in 1992 and 1993 . Howard won his first NBA championship with Miami in the 2012 NBA Finals and his second NBA championship in the 2013 NBA Finals . 
 Howard was an All @-@ American center and an honors student at Chicago Vocational Career Academy . Michigan was able to sign him early over numerous competing offers and then convince others in his recruiting class to join him . The Fab Five , which included Chris Webber , Jalen Rose , Jimmy King and Ray Jackson , served as regular starters during their freshman and sophomore years for the 1991 – 92 and 1992 – 93 Wolverines . Howard was the last member of the Fab Five to remain active as a professional basketball player . Although many of the Wolverines ' accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 were forfeited due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal , which involved booster payments to players to launder money from illegal gambling , Howard 's 1993 – 94 All @-@ American season continues to be recognized . 
 Howard has played six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half seasons ( 1994 – 2001 ) for the Bullets franchise ( renamed the Wizards in 1997 ) , three full seasons ( 2004 – 07 ) for the Houston Rockets , two plus seasons for the Heat and shorter stints for several other teams . During his rookie year with the Bullets , he became the first player to graduate on time with his class after leaving college early to play in the NBA . After one season as an All @-@ Rookie player and a second as an All @-@ Star and an All @-@ NBA performer , he became the first NBA player to sign a $ 100 million contract . While he continued to be a productive starter , he was never again selected to play in an All @-@ Star Game . Towards the end of his contract , he was traded at the NBA trade deadline twice to make salary cap room . He was most recently a regular starter during the 2005 – 06 NBA season . In 2010 , he signed with the Heat and entered his 17th NBA season , during which he reached the playoffs for the sixth time and made his first career NBA Finals appearance . He remained with the Heat the following season and won his first NBA championship during the 2012 NBA Finals . He returned to the Heat for part of the following season , and won a second championship . Howard has developed a reputation as a humanitarian for his civic commitment . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Howard 's grandmother , Jannie Mae Howard , was the daughter of sharecroppers from Belzoni , Mississippi . She had four daughters by her 19th birthday , including Howard 's mother Helena . Helena was an employee at a Chicago restaurant when she became pregnant with Juwan . Howard 's father , Leroy Watson , had just returned from the Army to a phone company job in Chicago . The two married quickly once they realized Helena was pregnant . For Howard 's first week of life , his high school junior mother kept him in a drawer at Jannie Mae 's house . Helena , who was 17 years old , did not want to be restricted or burdened raising her child , so Jannie Mae adopted him . His biological father , Leroy Watson , Jr . , wanted to name him Leroy Watson , III , but his grandmother rejected the suggestion , insisting on Juwan Antonio Howard . Although his mother visited on occasion as he was growing up , his grandmother raised him , along with two cousins . Howard has no siblings and is not close to his biological parents ; his grandmother was the primary influence in his life . He moved with her to several low @-@ income Chicago South Side projects ; she kept him out of trouble and away from gangs as he was growing up . One of their residences was a three @-@ bedroom apartment on 69th Street on the South Side of Chicago . As he blossomed under his grandmother 's influence and discipline , he became her " pride and joy " . 
 = = High school = = 
 Howard went to Chicago Vocational Career Academy , where he went on to play three seasons of varsity basketball . Vocational had an unheated gym and no locker rooms , which required that the team dress for games in a history classroom . Nonetheless , Howard went on to be named a 1991 All @-@ American basketball player by Parade magazine and won McDonald 's All American honors . He was also chosen for the National Honor Society and served as Vocational 's homecoming king . During recruiting visits by college coaches such as Illinois ' Lou Henson , DePaul 's Joey Meyer and Michigan 's Steve Fisher , Jannie Mae Howard did most of the questioning . 
 = = = Sophomore year = = = 
 At the start of his sophomore year in 1988 , Howard was 15 years old and already expected to be a coveted blue chip recruit in 1991 . He was regarded as one of the best sophomore basketball players in the Chicago metropolitan area . He scored 26 points in a Chicago Public High School League quarterfinal loss against a Deon Thomas @-@ led Simeon Career Academy team . Vocational ended the year with a 23 – 7 record . Howard was a second @-@ team selection and the only sophomore named to the league coaches ' 20 @-@ man 1988 – 89 All @-@ Public League team . 
 The summer after his sophomore year , the 6 @-@ foot @-@ 8 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 03 m ) center attended the Nike Academic Betterment and Career Development ( ABCD ) camp , which was held annually in Princeton , New Jersey , during the late 1980s . There he was matched against the 7 @-@ foot @-@ 4 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 24 m ) Shawn Bradley . At this camp , even though the much @-@ taller Bradley blocked his shots several times , Howard established himself as one of the best junior @-@ year big men in the country . He was involved in controversy for receiving a second pair of sneakers at the camp because he was suspected of stealing them . Howard denied theft , but he was sent home on the last day of the six @-@ day camp . 
 Howard also participated in the Bill <unk> camp in Rensselaer , Indiana , which more than 100 college coaches attended . According to the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , he was ranked as one of the top 10 underclassmen in the country during the camp . Howard attended other camps that summer ; his goal was to overcome Thomas , who was the reigning Chicago Tribune basketball player of the year , as the best big man in the state . By the time he ended his college career in 1994 , Howard was drafted a full round ahead of Thomas . 
 = = = Junior year = = = 
 As Howard entered his junior year , some sources listed him as the best junior basketball player in Illinois , while others ranked Tom Kleinschmidt ahead of him . Taylor Bell of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times noted that Howard was leaning toward playing either for DePaul or for Illinois . Howard was interested in Illinois because Thomas , whom Howard admired , had become a member of the 1989 – 90 Fighting Illini team . By the end of his junior year , league coaches named him to the first @-@ team All @-@ Chicago Public School League . He was selected to the Chicago Sun @-@ Times All @-@ Area team as well as the Class @-@ AA All @-@ State team and established himself as the top Chicago @-@ area junior ahead of Kleinschmidt . Howard had a sub @-@ par performance against King High School in the Chicago Public School League semifinals , but the Chicago Tribune named him to its All @-@ State second team . Vocational finished the year 24 – 7 . 
 Howard was also an honors student . After his junior year , he was one of 10 Illinois players invited back to the Nike All @-@ American Camp at Princeton . Others invited included Kleinschmidt , Donnie Boyce , William Gates , Billy Taylor , Rashard Griffith and Howard Nathan . Although Howard was considered one of the top prospects in the city of Chicago at that time , the player perceived as the best Chicago @-@ area prospect was Glenn Robinson of Gary , Indiana . By this time , Howard had eliminated DePaul from consideration since <unk> Cunningham , another Chicago @-@ area all @-@ star who might have otherwise convinced Howard to stay in Chicago , had transferred to Kansas State . He was considering Michigan , Michigan State , Kentucky , Arizona , Dayton , Marquette and Illinois . Howard was evaluated as the best senior basketball player at the camp ; the group of players in attendance included Chris Webber , Cherokee Parks , Robinson and Alan Henderson . 
 After being named Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) at the prestigious Boston Shootout and acknowledged as the leading participant at the Nike camp , Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country . By this time , he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well . Following his time at the Nike camp , his household was besieged by recruiters . Howard issued the following statement : " Contact my coach . I do not want my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all times of the day and night . I 'm not the only person who lives in this house . I think my wishes should be respected . If not , when it comes time to make my decision , I 'll take those things into account . " Although Howard was the best performer at the camp , talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects . Despite Howard 's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations , Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit . By the end of July 1990 , Howard was projected to sign with Michigan . 
 = = = Senior year = = = 
 During Michigan 's in @-@ home visit , Howard 's grandmother treated Michigan head coach Fisher , his assistants Mike Boyd and Brian Dutcher , Vocational coach Cook , Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey , Lois Howard ( Howard 's aunt ) and Howard to a soul food dinner . Dutcher had the responsibility to contact Howard several times a week . Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey , often staying at his house and using his car once he got a driver 's license . During the summer 1990 30 @-@ day visitation period , Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days . Dutcher developed an understanding of the dynamics of Howard 's relationship with his grandmother . While other coaches , such as Lute Olsen , almost ignored her during the recruiting , Dutcher understood that she was the key influence on his life , and understood that Kirskey also had sway with Howard . He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp that , which became the young athlete 's introduction to Ann Arbor , Michigan . 
 Howard was the president of Vocational 's Senior Boys ' Council . In the final days before his senior season decision regarding his college basketball team , Howard wavered between Arizona State and Michigan . He also made an official visit to Dayton . Despite the ongoing recruiting scandal , he made an unofficial visit to Illinois , which had recruited four of the five previous Chicago Public School League Illinois Players of the Year . At the time of his decision , Howard was considered one of the top five seniors in the country , but unlike many top basketball recruits , he decided not to hold a press conference to announce his choice . Although the official signing period was set for November 14 – 21 , 1990 , he selected Michigan on November 2 . Howard 's grandmother died of a heart attack a few hours after he announced that he would attend Michigan , and he moved in with his high school coach , Richard Cook . 
 Howard averaged 26 @.@ 9 points , 8 @.@ 4 rebounds and 3 @.@ 4 assists during his senior season , and finished in the top 10 percent of his academic class . He took Vocational to the Public League semifinals where they lost to Westinghouse College Prep , finishing with a 25 – 5 record , despite his 25 points and 12 rebounds . He befriended Jimmy King when they visited Michigan on the same weekend ; according to the Chicago Tribune Fisher Howard influenced King 's decision to also enroll there . According to Clyde Travis of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , Howard 's verbal commitment made up for Fisher 's failure to recruit Eric <unk> the prior year , even though <unk> ' father and grandfather had played for Michigan . With Jalen Rose , Webber , Howard and King – along with Ray Jackson , a less @-@ heralded prospect – the Michigan recruiting class was considered to be the best in the nation . Some regarded the class as among the greatest recruiting classes of all time . 
 As a senior , Howard edged Griffith and <unk> Garris for the most votes to the Sun @-@ Times ' annual All @-@ Chicago Public School League boys ' basketball team . He was also selected to the All @-@ Area team and was a repeat Class @-@ AA All @-@ State selection . Howard , Kleinschmidt and Robinson were all selected to the 10 @-@ member first team of Parade magazine 's 40 @-@ member high school All @-@ America boys ' basketball team . They were also chosen to play in the McDonald 's All @-@ America game . West MVP Webber posted 28 points and 12 rebounds in the game ; with Howard adding 16 points , the West won 108 – 106 . Howard also earned the Gatorade Circle of Champions ' Illinois Player of the Year Award . Howard 's ACT test score was high enough to make him eligible under Proposition 48 academic requirements to play as a freshman . Only eight of the top 25 Chicago Public School League players achieved a qualifying score on the test .

 Howard matriculated to the University of Michigan and joined his fellow freshmen for the 1991 – 92 Michigan Wolverines in forming a group that became known as the Fab Five . He also joined future NBA personalities Eric Riley and Rob Pelinka . As Michigan celebrated Midnight Madness on October 15 , 1991 , there was already talk that at least four of the five freshmen would be starting before the season ended . ( The five eventually started in a combined 304 of a possible 350 man @-@ games among them during their first two seasons . ) Early in his freshman season , Howard started in some games and came off the bench in others for the highly rated Wolverines . Over time , he won a starting role from Riley . In Michigan 's first matchup against Illinois , Howard scored 13 points and denied Thomas the ball consistently enough to hold him to 8 shots . His biggest contribution in the game was getting his hand on a loose ball to force a jump ball with 16 seconds left and Michigan leading by only three points . In the Elite Eight round of the 1992 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament , Michigan faced a Jimmy Jackson @-@ led Ohio State Buckeyes team that had beaten them twice during the regular season by double @-@ digit margins . Michigan won the rematch , during which the Fab Five scored all but two of the Wolverines ' points . 
 The victory gave the 24 – 8 Wolverines a berth in the Final Four , where they found themselves matched against a 29 – 4 Bob Huggins @-@ coached Cincinnati Bearcats team that averaged 83 @.@ 6 points per game and had lost to only three teams , two of which had beaten Michigan . Nick Van Exel led Cincinnati in postseason scoring . Howard , King and Riley shaved their heads for the game . Michigan won and earned a rematch with a Duke Blue Devils team that had beaten them by three points in overtime in December . In the initial contest , Howard had scored only four points . Entering the final game , he was averaging 11 @.@ 2 points and 6 @.@ 3 rebounds for the season . The day before the game , Howard had stomach cramps and fever and received fluids to combat dehydration . As a result , he was exempted from mandatory media meetings . Howard was part of a rotation with Webber and Riley that guarded the National Player of the Year , Christian Laettner . During Laettner 's first six possessions against Howard , Laettner dribbled the basketball off his foot , missed a shot , threw a pass that resulted in a turnover , traveled , threw the ball away and hit the backboard with a shot . Duke scored in its final 12 possessions of the championship game , going on a 23 – 6 run to win by a final margin of 71 – 51 . Despite his condition , Howard contributed 9 points in 29 minutes . Howard earned a reputation for his quick feet , ability to grasp fundamentals , and excellent moves in the low post , but also for his 1 @-@ to @-@ 2 assist @-@ to @-@ turnover ratio and a high number of fouls . 
 = = = Sophomore year = = = 
 As his sophomore year began , media reports alleged that three Wolverines basketball players were paid $ 300 each to participate in a charity basketball tournament in mid @-@ 1992 , during the off @-@ season . The reports further alleged that some others , including Howard , appeared at several summer basketball camps together , which was a possible violation of NCAA rules . At the beginning of his 1992 – 93 sophomore season , Michigan returned its top nine scorers and began the season ranked number one in the country by the Associated Press . Michigan lost its second game of the season in a rematch with Duke . Howard was described as the steadiest player on the team that season by coach Fisher . During the season , Howard purchased a million @-@ dollar disability insurance policy approved by the NCAA under the Exceptional Student Athlete Disability Insurance Program available to student @-@ athletes who are projected to be chosen high in the NBA , National Football League ( NFL ) , and Major League Baseball drafts . 
 In the semifinals of the 1993 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament against Kentucky , Howard contributed on offense and held Jamal Mashburn in check defensively ; Mashburn did not make a field goal in the last 12 : 36 of regulation . Sportswriter Jay Mariotti wrote that Howard had done " a terrific defensive job " in guarding Mashburn . The 31 – 4 Wolverines were matched up against the 33 – 4 North Carolina Tar Heels in the championship game ; both Fisher and North Carolina head coach Dean Smith were seeking their second national title . During the championship game Howard picked up his second personal foul with 9 minutes 42 seconds remaining in the first half and was soon substituted out as the entire team dealt with an accumulation of fouls . The game would be remembered for a late technical foul against Webber for attempting to call a time out when the Wolverines had none left ; this led to a Tar Heels victory . Over the course of the season , Howard averaged 14 @.@ 6 points and 7 @.@ 4 rebounds . After the season , Webber and Howard were invited to try out for the United States national basketball team that would compete at the 1993 World University Games and Under @-@ 22 World Championships . Howard did not make the team . 
 = = = Junior year = = = 
 With Webber 's departure for the NBA after his sophomore season , the 1993 – 94 Wolverines team entered the season ranked fifth in the nation as it opened the season against number 13 Georgia Tech . Since his grandmother had been born on December 25 , Howard got a tattoo reading " Jannie Mae " over his heart during Christmas break . During the season , Howard contracted the chicken pox in January . Michigan had a 21 – 6 ( 13 – 4 Big Ten ) record and tied with the Purdue Boilermakers for the conference lead with one game remaining . Michigan then lost ( for the third time in its last four games ) to a struggling Northwestern Wildcats team , and finished second in the Big Ten . After the season , Howard was selected as a first team All @-@ Big @-@ Ten member along with his teammate Rose , Purdue 's Robinson , Michigan State 's Shawn Respert , and Indiana 's Damon Bailey . In the opening round of the 1994 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament , Howard helped Michigan to a 78 – 74 overtime victory over Pepperdine by scoring 28 points and adding 9 rebounds before fouling out . In the second round , Howard posted 34 points and 18 rebounds to lead the team to an 84 – 79 victory over Texas . Michigan faced a Joe Smith @-@ led Maryland in the Sweet Sixteen round . Howard scored 24 points and had 11 rebounds before fouling out with 2 : 49 remaining in the 78 – 71 victory . Howard earned the regional MVP award with a game @-@ high 30 points and 13 rebounds in the Elite Eight round , despite collecting two fouls in the first two minutes and losing against the Arkansas Razorbacks , which had United States President Bill Clinton in attendance as a vocal supporter . On April 18 , Howard announced his intention to enter the 1994 NBA Draft . The following day , Rose announced he would enter the draft as well . Howard was 37 credit hours short of University of Michigan degree requirements , but said he intended to keep his promise to his grandmother that he would earn his diploma . 
 Howard left Michigan after being named an Associated Press third team All @-@ American during his junior year , and was taken by the Washington Bullets fifth overall in the 1994 NBA Draft . Howard was represented by David Falk . Although the Fab Five 's games in the Final Four have since been forfeited , Howard was not among the players , which included Robert Traylor , Webber , Rose , Maurice Taylor , and Louis Bullock , called before a grand jury to testify in the University of Michigan basketball scandal . He was not implicated in the scandal . Although the NCAA sanctioned Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball by forfeiting many of its records and accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 , Howard 's status as a 1993 – 94 All @-@ American remained intact .

 Entering the 1994 – 95 season , the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement , and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began . He continued to train in Chicago in late September amidst rumors that his draft rights could be traded to another team . While holding out , he was rumored to be part of a trade package with the Chicago Bulls that included <unk> <unk> and a first @-@ round draft choice in exchange for Scottie Pippen . Another rumor had Howard being packaged with Rex Chapman and Don MacLean for Pippen . On November 9 , eleventh overall 1994 NBA draft selection Carlos Rogers signed an NBA contract , making Howard the last first @-@ round selection without a contract . He missed most of the first month of the season and resided at an O 'Hare Airport hotel while protracted talks continued . Howard 's agent David Falk said that one of the main problems was that the Bullets wanted Howard to sign for a lower average salary than number six selection Sharone Wright . The Bullets stuck to a 10 @-@ year , $ 30 million ( $ 47 @.@ 9 million in 2016 dollars ) offer . On November 17 , Howard signed what was believed to be a 12 @-@ year , $ 37 @.@ 5 million ( $ 59 @.@ 9 million ) contract . Howard 's contract , which Sports Illustrated later said was an 11 @-@ year $ 36 million ( $ 57 @.@ 5 million ) deal , had an escape clause . Once he signed , he was reunited with Michigan teammate Webber as a member of the Bullets . Webber , who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season , was traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Bullets on November 18 for Tom <unk> and three first @-@ round draft choices . 
 After Webber joined the Bullets , many thought that the two former Fab Five members would bring success to the team , coached by Lynam . The Washington front line was expected to include Webber , Howard , and Kevin Duckworth and to have Gheorghe <unk> , a 7 @-@ foot @-@ 7 @-@ inch ( 231 cm ) Romanian center , coming off the bench . Chapman , MacLean , <unk> , Mitchell Butler and Scott Skiles were expected to provide solid perimeter play . Experts projected the Bullets as contenders for the Eastern Conference title . The Howard / Webber Bullets debut against the Boston Celtics established new Bullets television ratings records for the Home Team Sports network . However , the early season trade left the team in a state of confusion due to lack of familiarity , which resulted in communication difficulties on the court . Howard eventually moved into the starting lineup . As a power forward , Howard posted impressive numbers after he became a regular starter . Howard participated in the February 11 , 1995 , NBA All @-@ Star weekend events as a member of the Rookie Challenge . He earned second team All @-@ Rookie honors at the end of the season . That month , he became the second Bullet ( since the award 's inception in 1981 ) and first since Jeff Ruland in January 1982 to be named NBA Rookie of the Month . During the month he averaged 20 @.@ 1 points , 8 rebounds and 1 @.@ 2 blocks in 14 games , including his first two 30 @-@ point games . The following month Howard suffered an ankle injury , missing a total of 10 games ( all of which were Bullets losses ) . Over the course of the season , he averaged 17 @.@ 0 points per game and posted 17 double @-@ doubles in 65 games played ( 52 starts ) . He totalled 30 points or more on three separate occasions . The members of the team combined to miss a total of 317 games due to injury , and the team finished the season with a 21 – 61 record . 
 Howard became the first NBA athlete who entered the draft early and graduated with his academic class , thus fulfilling a promise he had made to his grandmother on the last day he saw her alive . He told Mitch Albom that when he made it to the NBA , he realized how much leisure time the multimillionaire players had and decided to do something productive instead of find ways to spend his new riches . " I knew if I kept pushing it off , I 'd never get it done , " he said . He completed his final 32 course hours by taking summer classes in 1994 during the NBA off @-@ season . He took correspondence classes and independent study courses during the following season , studying on road trips and mailing in his papers from the nearest post office . In the end , he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in radio @-@ television communication ( with a minor in business ) at Michigan . He told Albom that earning his degree made him a better example when speaking about staying in school . Although Howard had spent the prior year playing in the NBA , he returned to campus to partake in graduation ceremonies with his classmates . During the graduation , keynote speaker Marian Wright Edelman paid special recognition to Howard and Fab Five teammates King and Jackson , who graduated together , and noted that Howard 's graduation made him a role model for children . 
 In the off @-@ season , the Bullets traded Chapman , MacLean and Duckworth , and drafted Rasheed Wallace in the 1995 NBA Draft . In the preseason , the Bullets played the Detroit Pistons in an October game at the University of Michigan 's Crisler Arena , marking a homecoming for Howard . Webber was sidelined with a shoulder injury and missed the homecoming . Prior to the 1995 – 96 season , the Bullets were expected to be a contender with Webber , Howard , <unk> , Mark Price , and Robert Pack . However , Webber , Price and Pack missed almost the entire year ( 65 , 75 and 51 games respectively ) because of injuries . In February , the New York Knicks made two trades that put them in position to bid on Howard in the 1996 free agent market . Since Falk was the agent for both Patrick Ewing and Howard , sportswriter Dave Anderson of The New York Times felt the Knicks would have a good chance at Howard in July when the free agent market began . 
 Howard earned his only career NBA All @-@ Star Game selection for the February 11 , 1996 game . A Sports Illustrated story showed examples of him dominating games at will during that season . Howard also made news that season for his theatrics after being ejected from a February 27 game against the Charlotte Hornets . He kicked a water cooler across the court and was fined $ 5 @,@ 000 for making an obscene gesture . He concluded the season by scoring at least 20 points in his last 16 games . Howard became just the second player in Washington franchise history , after Bernard King , to post back @-@ to @-@ back 40 @-@ point games ( against Boston on April 17 , 1996 , with 40 , and at Toronto on April 19 , 1996 , with 42 ) . The 42 points proved to be his career high . His strong finish earned him an NBA Player of the Month award for April . In spite of the injuries to key teammates , 1995 – 96 was Howard 's best season , statistically . During the season , he finished 3rd in the NBA in minutes played , 6th in points scored and 10th in points per game ( 22 @.@ 1 ) . He was the Bullets ' leading scorer . Over the course of the season , he accumulated 22 double @-@ doubles in 81 games , including 6 in his last 8 games . At the end of the season , he was named to the All @-@ NBA team . In addition to his two 40 @-@ point performances , he posted 3 additional 30 @-@ point performances and scored at least 20 points in 56 of 81 games . Averaging 22 @.@ 1 points , 8 @.@ 1 rebounds and 4 @.@ 4 assists , he helped the Bullets record 39 victories . This was not enough for the Bullets to make the playoffs during their ninth consecutive losing season . 
 After averaging 17 points per game as a rookie and more than 22 per game in his second season , Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions . The Bullets offered Howard an $ 89 million contract , but the Miami Heat outbid them with a seven @-@ year deal estimated to be worth $ 98 to $ 101 million . However , according to the NBA league office , the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the salary cap by excluding performance bonuses for Tim Hardaway and P. J. Brown and failing to account for the impact of renegotiating Alonzo Mourning 's contract before coming to terms with Howard . The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard 's $ 9 million for the 1996 – 97 season placed the Heat over the cap . Howard then re @-@ signed with the Bullets on August 5 . He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $ 100 million ; his seven @-@ year contract was worth $ 105 million . The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re @-@ sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign Tracy Murray and Lorenzo Williams if they forfeited their 1997 NBA Draft first @-@ round selection rights . The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re @-@ signing their own player . The Heat pursued legal remedy in Florida state courts , seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract . Although an arbitration case involving the two contracts that Howard had signed appeared likely , ESPN reported that the Heat dropped their legal pursuit of Howard . The league moved for federal jurisdiction although the case remained on the docket for New York University law professor Daniel Collins to serve as arbitrator on three issues : " 1 . ) Did the Heat circumvent the cap in first signing Mourning ? ; 2 . ) Did the Heat <unk> bonus money for forward P. J. Brown and guard Tim Hardaway that was not counted correctly against the cap . ? ; 3 . ) Did the Heat add an illegal performance clause to Brown 's contract ? . " Meanwhile , the Heat 's contract was protected by a temporary injunction in Florida state court , which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract . The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team , especially head coach Pat Riley , continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid . If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap , the team could have been fined $ 5 million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season . By dropping their actions , the Heat avoided any possible penalties . In addition to signing free agents Murray and Williams , the Bullets traded for Rod Strickland and Harvey Grant . 
 As a statement against gun violence , Bullets owner Abe Pollin sought to change the franchise 's name . The Bullets became the Washington Wizards after asking fans to vote on the name . Although before the 1996 – 97 NBA season the Bullets / Wizards were expected to make the playoffs with Webber , Howard , and Strickland , there were rumors that Webber had difficulty adjusting to being a less important part of the offensive game plan in the presence of All @-@ Star Howard . Howard was plagued with shin splints , causing him to miss several preseason games . On November 11 , 1996 , Howard failed a sobriety test when he was caught speeding and was charged with driving while intoxicated . The following month he pleaded not guilty and committed to enter an alcohol rehabilitation and education program . After Lynam coached the Bullets to a 22 – 24 record , he was fired and the Bullets hired Bernie Bickerstaff , who posted a 22 – 13 record . Over the course of the 1996 – 97 season , Howard accumulated 24 double doubles in 82 games , while averaging 19 @.@ 1 points and 8 @.@ 1 rebounds . Although Howard averaged over 19 points per game and played all 82 games , he only scored 30 or more points twice during the regular season . The team finished its regular season with a 44 – 38 record but was swept in three games in the Eastern Conference first round by the Chicago Bulls , who went on to win their second consecutive NBA championship . The 1997 NBA Playoffs were Howard 's only NBA playoff appearance in his six @-@ plus seasons with the Washington franchise , and he averaged 18 @.@ 7 points and 6 rebounds while playing 43 minutes per game . The playoff appearance marked the franchise 's first playoff appearance since the 1988 NBA Playoffs . 
 The Wizards relocated from the US Airways Arena to the MCI Center for the 1997 – 98 season , during which Howard totaled 11 double @-@ doubles in 64 games , while averaging 18 @.@ 5 points and 8 @.@ 0 rebounds . He scored between 20 and 29 points 31 times that season but failed to score 30 points in any game . Howard injured his ankle and was unable to play between February 5 and March 17 . During Bickerstaff 's only full season as the Washington coach , the team posted a 42 – 40 record . 
 On April 6 , 1998 , Melissa Reed filed a sexual assault complaint against Howard and Webber after a party at Howard 's house . Lawyers for both offered different accounts . Howard 's lawyer said that Reed had initiated an unspecified consensual sex act with one of the men , but Reed , who could not afford a lawyer , claimed to have entered a room with Webber before being struck and restrained prior to being sexually assaulted . Neither Howard nor Webber testified in the case , and although the accuser and approximately 40 of the party attendees appeared before a grand jury , the Montgomery County State 's Attorney announced that prosecution was not warranted and closed the case in May . This came just after the Wizards ' general manager Wes Unseld separated Webber and Howard on May 15 by trading Webber to the Sacramento Kings , receiving Mitch Richmond and Otis Thorpe in exchange . In June , Howard filed suit against Reed , seeking compensation for emotional distress for damage to his reputation and image . The accuser was absent during the proceeding and failed to respond to the lawsuit for defamation . In November , Howard was awarded the $ 1 in compensatory damages that he sought to clear his name and $ 100 @,@ 000 in punitive damages plus legal costs . 
 After the 1998 – 99 NBA lockout , the Wizards posted an 18 – 32 record in the shortened season . The team started out 13 – 19 under Bickerstaff and was 5 – 13 under Jim <unk> after Bickerstaff was fired . Howard was a vocal critic of Bickerstaff throughout his tenure , stating the coach was unable to make proper in @-@ game adjustments . Howard , who again had an ankle injury , missed the last 14 games of the season . Over the course of the 1998 – 99 season , he posted 11 double @-@ doubles and two 15 @-@ rebound performances in 36 games , while averaging 18 @.@ 9 points and 7 @.@ 0 rebounds . 
 During the 1999 – 2000 season , Howard accumulated 10 double @-@ doubles in 82 games , while averaging 14 @.@ 9 points and 8 @.@ 1 rebounds . The Wizards endured a 14 – 30 start under head coach Gar Heard before going 15 – 23 under Heard 's replacement , Darrell Walker . According to Sam Smith from the Chicago Tribune , Howard had become unpopular and a bit of a disappointment by his sixth season in Washington . He posted 30 points twice , including a season @-@ high 36 in a fourth @-@ quarter comeback to end a five @-@ game losing streak in January . During the offseason , Howard 's name surfaced in trade rumors that had him going to the New York Knicks in exchange for Ewing because the Wizards ' management thought that the trade would better position the team for the 2001 free agent market . Following the season , Walker was replaced by Leonard Hamilton , becoming the team 's sixth head coach since last making the NBA Playoffs four years earlier . 
 Although it had been five years since his only All @-@ Star appearance , Howard was the fourth @-@ highest @-@ paid player in the NBA during the 2000 – 01 season , behind Kevin Garnett , Shaquille O 'Neal and Mourning . Howard , along with Strickland and Richmond , were marquee names on the team under contract to earn at least $ 10 million . On December 31 , 2000 , Howard , posted his career high of 15 made free throws in a game against the Detroit Pistons . Despite the fact that the February 11 , 2001 NBA All @-@ Star Game was hosted by Washington at the MCI Center , Howard was not included on the Eastern Conference team even when it had to make two late additions ( Anthony Mason and Latrell Sprewell ) . According to Milton Kent of The Baltimore Sun , not only did Howard 's statistics ( approximately 18 points , 7 rebounds and 2 @.@ 8 assists ) compare favorably to both players , but his role as his team 's primary scoring option made his statistics more significant than those of Mason and Sprewell .

 Jordan , who had become the Wizards ' head of basketball operations the prior season , traded Howard , Obinna <unk> , and Calvin Booth to the Dallas Mavericks for Laettner , Loy Vaught , Etan Thomas , Hubert Davis , Courtney Alexander and $ 3 million on February 22 , 2001 , at the NBA trade deadline . Jordan 's move was praised for freeing up salary cap space in advance of the NBA 's first season with a luxury tax . The trade served the Mavericks by giving them a new offensive weapon and enabling them to match up defensively against the NBA Western Conference power forwards such as Wallace , Tim Duncan , Karl Malone and Webber . Washington finished the year with a 19 – 63 record under coach Hamilton . 
 During the 2000 – 01 season , the Mavericks finished 53 – 29 under coach Don Nelson . Howard provided the Mavericks with a back @-@ to @-@ the @-@ basket player who moved into the starting power @-@ forward position , enabling Dirk Nowitzki to play small forward and Shawn Bradley to play center . During the season , Howard tallied 16 double @-@ doubles and five 30 @-@ point performances in 81 games , while averaging 18 @.@ 0 points and 7 @.@ 1 rebounds . On a team with All @-@ Star Michael Finley and future MVPs Steve Nash and Nowitzki , Howard was the highest @-@ paid player . On March 20 , Howard blocked five shots , his career high , against the Portland Trail Blazers . In the 2001 NBA Playoffs , the Mavericks advanced past the Utah Jazz 3 games to 2 before losing to the San Antonio Spurs , 4 games to 1 . The Utah games marked the first time Howard played for a team that won an NBA playoff series . In the first game of the series against the Spurs , Howard slammed Spurs guard Derek Anderson to the floor while trying to block Anderson 's layup late in the game . Anderson suffered a separated shoulder on the play , and Howard received a flagrant foul and was ejected . After the game , Howard , Spurs coach Gregg Popovich , and Mavs owner Mark Cuban all said the foul was committed without malice or intent to injure Anderson . In the Mavericks ' 10 playoff games , Howard totaled three double @-@ doubles while averaging 13 @.@ 4 points and 8 @.@ 3 rebounds in 39 @.@ 1 minutes . 
 During the 2001 – 02 season , he posted 17 double @-@ doubles and three 30 @-@ point performances in 81 games ( 72 starts ) , while averaging 14 @.@ 6 points and 7 @.@ 6 rebounds . This was the first time since his rookie holdout season that he did not start every game he played in . All reserve appearances occurred between November 21 and December 11 , and eight of them were in consecutive games between November 21 and December 5 . On January 31 , he posted a career @-@ high 16 rebounds against the Houston Rockets .

 The Mavericks traded him with Donnell Harvey , Hardaway and a 2002 first @-@ round pick to the Denver Nuggets for Raef LaFrentz , Avery Johnson , Van Exel and Tariq Abdul @-@ Wahad on February 21 , 2002 . At the time of the trade , Howard was considered the Mavericks ' best low @-@ post defender . On March 25 , 2002 , he scored his 10,000th career point at Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks . Howard started all 28 games that he played for the Nuggets . Don Nelson 's Mavericks went to the second round of the 2002 NBA Playoffs after trading Howard , while the Nuggets failed to make the playoffs under coaches Dan Issel and Mike Evans . By the end of the season , Nuggets general manager Vandeweghe had cleared almost $ 20 million of salary cap space , leaving the team with few veterans and only Howard and Marcus Camby as well @-@ known players . This made the team an undesirable coaching assignment for veteran coaches . In the offseason , the Nuggets replaced Evans with the relatively unknown Jeff <unk> . 
 During a preseason game , Howard attempted to punch Al Harrington and Jermaine O 'Neal , which earned him a suspension on October 25 , 2002 . As a result , Howard missed the Nuggets ' first two games of the regular season , and this cost him $ 458 @,@ 000 in salary . Howard first attempted to hit Harrington late in the fourth quarter on a night when Howard had missed nine of ten shots . When O 'Neal intervened , the two pushed and shoved each other before Howard started punching again . At around the same time , the University of Michigan basketball scandal investigation came to an end with many of the accomplishments of the Fab Five being rescinded through National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctions . Although many of the records of the Fab Five were erased , Howard 's and teammate Rose 's 1994 All @-@ American recognitions were unaffected by the scandal . During the 2002 – 03 regular season , he accumulated 18 double @-@ doubles , two 30 @-@ point performances , and three 15 @-@ rebound performances in 77 games , while averaging 18 @.@ 4 points and 7 @.@ 6 rebounds . The 2002 – 03 Nuggets were 17 – 65 under <unk> . The team struggled with the league 's lowest payroll and three rookies in the starting lineup . Howard started all 77 games in which he played . 
 = = = Orlando Magic ( 2003 – 2004 ) = = = 
 Howard signed what was believed to be a five @-@ year , $ 28 million contract as a free agent with the Orlando Magic on July 16 , 2003 ; he had been expected to sign with either Detroit or Minnesota . During the season , teammate Tracy McGrady successfully defended his scoring championship , while Howard attempted to be a positive influence when the situation arose , such as when he attempted to stop McGrady from kicking the basketball into the stands twice in a row . McGrady missed the last 10 games of the season with knee problems ( ending his season on March 24 ) , leading to Howard 's best performances of the season : Howard had 33 points and 11 rebounds on April 2 against the Atlanta Hawks , and he had 38 points on April 12 against the Chicago Bulls . Over the course of the 2003 – 04 season , he had 16 double @-@ doubles and two 30 @-@ point performances in 81 games ( 77 starts ) , while averaging 17 @.@ 2 points and 7 @.@ 1 rebounds . The team compiled a 21 – 61 record , the worst in the NBA , under coaches Doc Rivers and Johnny Davis . 
 = = = Houston Rockets ( 2004 – 07 ) = = = 
 On June 29 , 2004 , Howard and Magic teammates McGrady , <unk> Lue and Reece Gaines were part of a seven @-@ player trade that sent 2003 – 04 Houston Rockets starting guards Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley , plus Kelvin Cato , to the Magic . In late November , as a short term experiment , head coach Jeff Van Gundy decided to reduce Howard 's playing time so that Scott Padgett could move up in the rotation to backup power forward . Meanwhile , Maurice Taylor started the first 16 games of the season for the Rockets at power forward . Van Gundy was unsatisfied with his power forward rotation , so he made the first starting lineup change of the season not mandated by injury by putting Howard into the starting lineup ahead of Taylor . Although Taylor was available and played , Howard became the regular starter on December 2 and started for the rest of the season , and the team traded Taylor before the trade deadline in February . 
 The 2004 – 05 Rockets were 51 – 31 under Van Gundy and lost in the first round of the 2005 NBA Playoffs to the Dallas Mavericks , four games to three . Although the Rockets made the playoffs , Howard 's season ended on March 14 , when he left a game with a sprained medial collateral ligament ( MCL ) in his right knee . Initially , the injury was supposed to sideline Howard for four weeks . The injury coincided with a period in which he developed symptoms of viral myocarditis , including heart palpitations , mild chest pains and fever and was diagnosed with a viral infection in his heart . His limited physical activity impaired his MCL rehabilitation . Over the course of the 2004 – 05 season , Howard achieved seven double @-@ doubles in 61 games ( 47 starts ) , while averaging 9 @.@ 6 points and 5 @.@ 7 rebounds . His 26 @.@ 6 minutes per game marked the first season that he played less than 32 minutes per game . 
 During the 2005 – 06 season , Howard recorded 10 double @-@ doubles and two 30 @-@ point performances in 80 games ( all as a starter ) , while averaging 11 @.@ 8 points and 6 @.@ 7 rebounds . He played 31 @.@ 7 minutes per game , and this was the last season in which he averaged 30 minutes per game ; this was also the final season in which Howard started at least half of the games in which he played . The Rockets were 34 – 48 under Van Gundy and missed the playoffs . Howard was suspended one game without pay in January for shoving the basketball into the face of Toronto guard Mike James in an exchange that occurred after Howard fouled James on a drive to the basket . On April 10 , Yao Ming suffered a season @-@ ending broken foot . In Yao 's absence , Howard posted a season @-@ high 31 points on April 17 against the Denver Nuggets . 
 In the 2006 – 07 season , Howard achieved nine double @-@ doubles in 80 games played ( 37 starts ) , while averaging 9 @.@ 7 points and 5 @.@ 9 rebounds . During the season , he lost the starting power forward position to Chuck Hayes , but got back in the starting lineup when Yao got injured . His 26 @.@ 5 minutes per game marked a new career low . Howard only started 38 games , including 32 consecutive starts between December 26 , 2006 , and March 3 , 2007 , while center Yao was recovering from his fractured right leg . The 2006 – 07 Rockets were 52 – 30 under Van Gundy for the regular season . The Rockets entered the 2007 NBA Playoffs with little experience ; Howard was one of only three players on the team ( along with Rafer Alston and Dikembe Mutombo ) to have previously won any NBA playoff series . Once the playoffs began , Howard served as a key reserve on the Rockets ' short bench rotation that also included Luther Head and Mutombo . The Rockets managed to split the first 4 games even though Head and Howard only combined to average 7 @.@ 6 points , including a combined pointless 0 @-@ for @-@ 10 game three . Although Howard had a productive game five with 12 points and 6 rebounds which contributed to a Rockets victory , the team lost in the first round of the 2007 playoffs to the Utah Jazz , four games to three . In the playoffs , reserve Howard averaged 5 @.@ 0 points and 4 @.@ 4 rebounds in 22 @.@ 4 minutes . Although Howard was described as a consistent role player and locker @-@ room leader , his salary continued to be perceived as outrageous by sportswriters such as the Houston Chronicle 's Jerome Solomon . 
 On June 14 , 2007 , Howard was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for James and Justin Reed . According to ESPN , he regretted not choosing Minnesota the last time he had been a free agent and was looking forward to playing with Garnett . Soon after Howard signed with Minnesota , the team traded Garnett to the Boston Celtics . Howard made it clear he was not interested in being on a team in Minnesota that was focused on developing young talent and consequently requested a trade once Garnett was no longer a member of the team . Howard still had $ 6 @.@ 88 million and $ 7 @.@ 38 million in salary owed to him over the next two seasons , which made him difficult to trade . Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor noted that the team would attempt to accommodate his wishes but acknowledged that doing so would be difficult . On October 29 , 2007 , the Timberwolves waived Howard after agreeing to a contractual buyout agreement worth $ 10 million spread over four years instead of the roughly $ 14 @.@ 25 million ( $ 6 @.@ 88 million plus $ 7 @.@ 38 million ) that Minnesota would otherwise have owed him .

 Howard agreed to terms with the Dallas Mavericks on October 30 , 2007 , but was not able to officially sign until the next day , when he cleared waivers .

In his limited role he never played more than 18 minutes and had season @-@ highs of seven rebounds and six points . The 2007 – 08 Mavericks were 51 – 31 under coach Johnson and lost in the first round of the 2008 NBA Playoffs to the New Orleans Hornets four games to one .

 On October 3 , 2008 , Howard rejoined the Denver Nuggets , but was later released when the Nuggets made a three @-@ for @-@ one trade of Allen Iverson for Chauncey Billups , Antonio McDyess and Cheikh <unk> on November 3 that put them over the 15 @-@ man roster size limit . When he was waived , Howard was the only player on the Nuggets ' roster without a guaranteed contract . Before the trade , Howard had played in three games during the 2008 – 09 season . His appearances had all come from off the bench and lasted between 7 and 8 minutes . After Howard departed , the Nuggets went on to post a 54 – 28 record and reach the Western Conference finals under George Karl .

He had his other double @-@ double of the 2009 – 10 season the next night when he made his first start of the season . All of Howard 's performances with 10 rebounds or more occurred between December 22 and February 3 . December 23 marked the start of 14 consecutive starting appearances and 24 starts in 26 appearances ( ending on February 16 ) for him .

At age 39 , Howard was the third @-@ oldest active player in the league during the 2011 – 12 NBA season , behind Kurt Thomas and Grant Hill . Before Game 4 of an 2012 NBA playoffs series against the Indiana Pacers , Howard engaged in pregame verbal sparring with Lance Stephenson after Stephenson mocked Howard 's teammate James . Despite this incident , Howard was a maturing influence on the team during the playoffs ; according to David Neal of The Miami Herald , " More often , Howard stood as the body of reason — getting between Dwyane Wade and Spoelstra against Indiana in Game 3 of the second round , pulling Mario Chalmers away from Oklahoma City star Kevin Durant . " On June 21 , 2012 , Howard became the first and only member of the Fab Five to win an NBA championship , as a role player on the 2011 – 12 Miami Heat . Howard was on the court as time expired in the series @-@ clinching game because the three stars of the Heat ( James , Wade and Bosh ) had arranged it . Howard spoke about representing the Fab Five after the Heat won the 2012 NBA Finals . A teammate with the Heat was Shane Battier , who grew up in Detroit as a fan of the Fab Five and idolized Howard .

 In college , Howard was regarded as one of the best defensive big men in the country . According to Mariotti , he was also regarded as a " rock @-@ solid " power forward who provided rebounds and defense , in contrast to his flamboyant teammate Webber . Fisher referred to Howard as his " Rock of Gibraltar " . His consistency was described by Chicago Tribune journalist Skip <unk> as Michigan 's " ballast , steadying them on those many occasions when they wavered . And their savior , rescuing them from their many follies " . 
 After the 1994 draft , NBA analyst Doug Collins described Howard as a player who could " play with his back to the basket " and " shoot from about 16 feet outside " and who played " with a lot of energy and emotion " . The Bullets ' general manager , John Nash , who was disappointed that Jason Kidd was no longer available at the fifth pick of the draft , told Jerry Bembry of The Baltimore Sun that Howard was " as fundamentally sound as any player in the draft " and that he " [ had ] a discipline about his game and [ used ] a high level of skill and technique " . Bembry said , " Not only can Howard post up , he passes effectively and is able to hit a jumper up to 17 feet , " adding that he also was " an excellent position defender " . Later Bembry noted that he was a power forward who was able to play center , adding that at Michigan he was " most effective playing with his back to the basket " but could also pass effectively and hit medium @-@ range jumpers . The Bullets ' head coach , Jim Lynam , described Howard as a " complete player " and noted , " [ H ] e can defend you and he can score over you " .

 = Boron nitride = 
 Boron nitride is a heat- and chemically resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN . It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice . The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite is the most stable and soft among BN polymorphs , and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products . The cubic ( sphalerite structure ) variety analogous to diamond is called c @-@ BN ; it is softer than diamond , but its thermal and chemical stability is superior . The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form . 
 Because of excellent thermal and chemical stability , boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high @-@ temperature equipment . Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology . <unk> of BN can be produced that have a structure similar to that of carbon nanotubes , i.e. graphene ( or BN ) sheets rolled on themselves , but the properties are very different .

 The most stable crystalline form is the hexagonal one , also called h @-@ BN , α @-@ BN , g @-@ BN , and graphitic boron nitride . Hexagonal boron nitride ( point group 
 = <unk> ; space group = 
 P63 / mmc ) has a layered structure similar to graphite . Within each layer , boron and nitrogen atoms are bound by strong covalent bonds , whereas the layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces . The <unk> " registry " of these sheets differs , however , from the pattern seen for graphite , because the atoms are eclipsed , with boron atoms lying over and above nitrogen atoms . This registry reflects the polarity of the B – N bonds . Still , h @-@ BN and graphite are very close neighbors and even the <unk> hybrids have been synthesized where carbon substitutes for some B and N atoms . 
 = = = Cubic form ( c @-@ BN ) = = = 
 Cubic boron nitride has a crystal structure analogous to that of diamond . Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite , the cubic form is less stable than the hexagonal form , but the conversion rate between the two is negligible at room temperature , as it is for diamond . The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure , the same as that of diamond , and is also called β @-@ BN or c @-@ BN . 
 = = = Wurtzite form ( w @-@ BN ) = = = 
 The wurtzite form of boron nitride ( w @-@ BN ; point group 
 = <unk> ; space group = 
 <unk> ) has the same structure as lonsdaleite , a rare hexagonal polymorph of carbon . As in the cubic form , the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into tetrahedra , but in w @-@ BN the angles between neighboring tetrahedra are different .

 Sources : amorphous BN , crystalline BN , graphite , diamond . 
 The partly ionic structure of BN layers in h @-@ BN reduces <unk> and electrical conductivity , whereas the <unk> interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h @-@ BN relative to graphite . The reduced electron @-@ delocalization in hexagonal @-@ BN is also indicated by its absence of color and a large band gap . Very different bonding – strong covalent within the basal planes ( planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded ) and weak between them – causes high anisotropy of most properties of h @-@ BN . 
 For example , the hardness , electrical and thermal conductivity are much higher within the planes than perpendicular to them . On the contrary , the properties of c @-@ BN and w @-@ BN are more homogeneous and isotropic . 
 Those materials are extremely hard , with the hardness of bulk c @-@ BN being slightly smaller and w @-@ BN even higher than that of diamond . Polycrystalline c @-@ BN with grain sizes on the order of 10 nm is also reported to have Vickers hardness comparable or higher than diamond . Because of much better stability to heat and transition metals , c @-@ BN surpasses diamond in mechanical applications , such as machining steel . The thermal conductivity of BN is among the highest of all electric insulators ( see table ) . 
 Boron nitride can be doped p @-@ type with beryllium and n @-@ type with boron , sulfur , silicon or if co @-@ doped with carbon and nitrogen . Both hexagonal and cubic BN are wide @-@ gap semiconductors with a band @-@ gap energy corresponding to the UV region . If voltage is applied to h @-@ BN or c @-@ BN , then it emits UV light in the range 215 – 250 nm and therefore can potentially be used as light @-@ emitting diodes ( LEDs ) or lasers . 
 Little is known on melting behavior of boron nitride . It sublimates at 2973 ° C at normal pressure releasing nitrogen gas and boron , but melts at elevated pressure . 
 = = = Thermal stability = = = 
 Hexagonal and cubic ( and probably w @-@ BN ) BN show remarkable chemical and thermal stabilities . For example , h @-@ BN is stable to decomposition at temperatures up to 1000 ° C in air , 1400 ° C in vacuum , and 2800 ° C in an inert atmosphere . The reactivity of h @-@ BN and c @-@ BN is relatively similar , and the data for c @-@ BN are summarized in the table below . 
 Thermal stability of c @-@ BN can be summarized as follows : 
 In air or oxygen : B2O3 protective layer prevents further oxidation to ~ 1300 ° C ; no conversion to hexagonal form at 1400 ° C. 
 In nitrogen : some conversion to h @-@ BN at 1525 ° C after 12 h . 
 In vacuum ( 10 − 5 Pa ) : conversion to h @-@ BN at 1550 – 1600 ° C. 
 = = = Chemical stability = = = 
 Boron nitride is insoluble in the usual acids , but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides , such as LiOH , KOH , NaOH @-@ Na2CO3 , <unk> , Li3N , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , which are therefore used to etch BN . 
 = = = Thermal conductivity = = = 
 The theoretical thermal conductivity of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons ( BNNRs ) can approach 1700 – 2000 W / ( m · K ) , which has the same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for graphene , and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons . Moreover , the thermal transport in the BNNRs is anisotropic . The thermal conductivity of zigzag @-@ edged BNNRs is about 20 % larger than that of armchair @-@ edged nanoribbons at room temperature .

 In 2009 , a naturally occurring boron nitride mineral ( proposed name <unk> ) was reported in Tibet . The substance was found in dispersed micron @-@ sized inclusions of <unk> ( c @-@ BN ) in chromium @-@ rich rocks in Tibet . In 2013 , the International Mineralogical Association affirmed the mineral and the name . 
 = = Synthesis = = 
 = = = Preparation and reactivity of hexagonal BN = = = 
 Boron nitride is produced synthetically . Hexagonal boron nitride is obtained by the reacting boron trioxide ( B2O3 ) or boric acid ( B ( OH ) 3 ) with ammonia ( NH3 ) or urea ( CO ( NH2 ) 2 ) in a nitrogen atmosphere : 
 B2O3 + 2 NH3 → 2 BN + 3 H2O ( T 
 = 900 ° C ) 
 B ( OH ) 3 + NH3 → BN + 3 H2O ( T = 
 900 ° C ) 
 B2O3 + CO ( NH2 ) 2 → 2 BN + CO2 + 2 H2O ( T > 1000 ° C ) 
 B2O3 + 3 <unk> + 10 N2 → 20 BN + 3 CaO ( T > 1500 ° C ) 
 The resulting disordered ( amorphous ) boron nitride contains 92 – 95 % BN and 5 – 8 % B2O3 . The remaining B2O3 can be evaporated in a second step at temperatures > 1500 ° C in order to achieve BN concentration > 98 % . Such annealing also crystallizes BN , the size of the crystallites increasing with the annealing temperature . 
 h @-@ BN parts can be fabricated inexpensively by hot @-@ pressing with subsequent machining . The parts are made from boron nitride powders adding boron oxide for better compressibility . Thin films of boron nitride can be obtained by chemical vapor deposition from boron trichloride and nitrogen precursors . Combustion of boron powder in nitrogen plasma at 5500 ° C yields ultrafine boron nitride used for lubricants and <unk> . 
 Boron nitride reacts with iodine fluoride in <unk> at − 30 ° C to produce an extremely sensitive contact explosive , <unk> , in low yield . Boron nitride reacts with nitrides of alkali metals and lanthanides to form <unk> compounds . For example : 
 Li3N + BN → <unk>

 Similar to graphite , various molecules , such as NH3 or alkali metals , can be intercalated into hexagonal boron nitride , that is inserted between its layers . Both experiment and theory suggest the intercalation is much more difficult for BN than for graphite . 
 = = = Preparation of cubic BN = = = 
 Synthesis of c @-@ BN uses same methods as that of diamond : Cubic boron nitride is produced by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature , much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite . Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18 GPa and temperatures between 1730 and <unk> ° C , that is similar parameters as for direct graphite @-@ diamond conversion . The addition of a small amount of boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4 – 7 GPa and temperature to 1500 ° C. As in diamond synthesis , to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures , a catalyst is added , such as lithium , potassium , or magnesium , their nitrides , their <unk> , water with ammonium compounds , or hydrazine . Other industrial synthesis methods , again borrowed from diamond growth , use crystal growth in a temperature gradient , or explosive shock wave . The shock wave method is used to produce material called <unk> , a <unk> compound of boron , carbon , and nitrogen . 
 Low @-@ pressure deposition of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible . As in diamond growth , the major problem is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases ( h @-@ BN or graphite , respectively ) . Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas , boron trifluoride is used for c @-@ BN . Ion beam deposition , plasma @-@ enhanced chemical vapor deposition , pulsed laser deposition , reactive sputtering , and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well . 
 = = = Preparation of wurtzite BN = = = 
 Wurtzite BN can be obtained via static high @-@ pressure or dynamic shock methods . The limits of its stability are not well defined . Both c @-@ BN and w @-@ BN are formed by compressing h @-@ BN , but formation of w @-@ BN occurs at much lower temperatures close to 1700 ° C. 
 = = = Production statistics = = = 
 Whereas the production and consumption figures for the raw materials used for BN synthesis , namely boric acid and boron trioxide , are well known ( see boron ) , the corresponding numbers for the boron nitride are not listed in statistical reports . An estimate for the 1999 world production is 300 to 350 metric tons . The major producers and consumers of BN are located in the United States , Japan , China and Germany . In 2000 , prices varied from about $ 75 / kg to $ 120 / kg for standard industrial @-@ quality h @-@ BN and were about up to $ 200 – $ 400 / kg for high purity BN grades . 
 = = Applications = = 
 = = = Hexagonal BN = = = 
 Hexagonal BN ( h @-@ BN ) is the most widely used polymorph . It is a good lubricant at both low and high temperatures ( up to 900 ° C , even in an oxidizing atmosphere ) . h @-@ BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite ( alternative lubricant ) would be problematic . Another advantage of h @-@ BN over graphite is that its <unk> does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers . Therefore , h @-@ BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum , e.g. in space applications . The lubricating properties of fine @-@ grained h @-@ BN are used in cosmetics , paints , dental cements , and pencil leads . 
 Hexagonal BN was first used in cosmetics around 1940 in Japan . However , because of its high price , h @-@ BN was soon abandoned for this application . Its use was revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h @-@ BN production processes , and currently h @-@ BN is used by nearly all leading producers of cosmetic products for foundations , make @-@ up , eye shadows , <unk> , kohl pencils , lipsticks and other skincare products . 
 Because of its excellent thermal and chemical stability , boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high @-@ temperature <unk> h @-@ BN can be included in ceramics , alloys , resins , plastics , rubbers , and other materials , giving them self @-@ lubricating properties . Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking . Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity . Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties , BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors , microwave @-@ transparent windows , and as a structural material for seals . 
 Hexagonal BN is used in xerographic process and laser printers as a charge leakage barrier layer of the photo drum . In the automotive industry , h @-@ BN mixed with a binder ( boron oxide ) is used for sealing oxygen sensors , which provide feedback for adjusting fuel flow . The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h @-@ BN . 
 Parts can be made by hot pressing from four commercial grades of h @-@ BN . Grade <unk> contains a boron oxide binder ; it is usable up to 550 – 850 ° C in oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600 ° C in vacuum , but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water . Grade <unk> uses a calcium borate binder and is usable at 1600 ° C. Grades HBC and HBT contain no binder and can be used up to 3000 ° C. 
 Two @-@ dimensional <unk> ( monolayer thick sheets ) has been shown to be an excellent proton conductor , yielding unexpectedly high proton transport rates . This high proton transport rate , combined with the high electrical resistance of h @-@ BN , may lead to important advances in research such as fuel cells and water electrolysis . 
 h @-@ BN has been used since the mid @-@ 2000s as a bullet and bore lubricant in precision target rifle applications as an alternative to molybdenum disulfide coating , commonly referred to as " <unk> " . It is claimed to increase effective barrel life , increase intervals between bore cleaning , and decrease the deviation in point of impact between clean bore first shots and subsequent shots . 
 = = = Cubic boron nitride = = = 
 Cubic boron nitride ( CBN or c @-@ BN ) is widely used as an abrasive . Its usefulness arises from its insolubility in iron , nickel , and related alloys at high temperatures , whereas diamond is soluble in these metals to give carbides . Polycrystalline c @-@ BN ( <unk> ) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel , whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys , ceramics , and stone . When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures , BN forms a passivation layer of boron oxide . Boron nitride binds well with metals , due to formation of <unk> of metal borides or nitrides . Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used in the tool bits of cutting tools . For grinding applications , softer binders , e.g. resin , porous ceramics , and soft metals , are used . Ceramic binders can be used as well . Commercial products are known under names " Borazon " ( by Diamond Innovations ) , and " <unk> " or " <unk> " ( by Russian vendors ) . Similar to diamond , the combination in c @-@ BN of highest thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is ideal for heat spreaders . Contrary to diamond , large c @-@ BN pellets can be produced in a simple process ( called sintering ) of annealing c @-@ BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures slightly below the BN decomposition temperature . This ability of c @-@ BN and h @-@ BN powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts . 
 As cubic boron nitride consists of light atoms and is very robust chemically and mechanically , it is one of the popular materials for X @-@ ray membranes : low mass results in small X @-@ ray absorption , and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes , thus further reducing the absorption . 
 = = = Amorphous boron nitride = = = 
 Layers of amorphous boron nitride ( a @-@ BN ) are used in some semiconductor devices , e.g. <unk> . They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of <unk> with caesium , or by thermal chemical vapor deposition methods . Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h @-@ BN layers , or at high temperatures , c @-@ BN .

 = = = Boron nitride nanomesh = = = 
 Boron nitride nanomesh is a nanostructured two @-@ dimensional material . It consists of a single BN layer , which forms by self @-@ assembly a highly regular mesh after high @-@ temperature exposure of a clean rhodium or ruthenium surface to <unk> under ultra @-@ high vacuum . The nanomesh looks like an assembly of hexagonal pores . The distance between 2 pore centers is 3 @.@ 2 nm and the pore diameter is ~ 2 nm . Other terms for this material are <unk> or white graphene . 
 The boron nitride nanomesh is not only stable to decomposition under vacuum , air and some liquids , but also up to temperatures of 800 ° C. In addition , it shows the extraordinary ability to trap molecules and metallic clusters which have similar sizes to the nanomesh pores , forming a well @-@ ordered array . These characteristics promise interesting applications of the nanomesh in areas like catalysis , surface functionalisation , spintronics , quantum computing and data storage media like hard drives . 
 = = = Boron nitride nanotubes = = = 
 Boron nitride nanotubes were predicted in 1994 and experimentally discovered in 1995 . They can be imagined as a rolled up sheet of boron nitride . Structurally , it is a close analog of the carbon nanotube , namely a long cylinder with diameter of several to hundred nanometers and length of many micrometers , except carbon atoms are alternately substituted by nitrogen and boron atoms . However , the properties of BN nanotubes are very different : whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius , a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator with a bandgap of ~ 5 @.@ 5 eV , basically independent of tube chirality and morphology . In addition , a layered BN structure is much more thermally and chemically stable than a graphitic carbon structure . 
 = = = Composites containing BN = = = 
 Addition of boron nitride to silicon nitride ceramics improves the thermal shock resistance of the resulting material . For the same purpose , BN is added also to silicon nitride @-@ alumina and titanium nitride @-@ alumina ceramics . Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia , borosilicate glasses , glass ceramics , enamels , and composite ceramics with titanium boride @-@ boron nitride , titanium boride @-@ aluminium nitride @-@ boron nitride , and silicon carbide @-@ boron nitride composition . 
 = = Health issues = = 
 Boron nitride ( along with Si3N4 , <unk> , and BNC ) is reported to show weak <unk> activity , and to cause pneumoconiosis when inhaled in particulate form . The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10 mg / m3 for BN and 4 for <unk> or <unk> . 
 = Structural coloration = 
 Structural coloration is the production of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light , sometimes in combination with pigments . For example , peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown , but their microscopic structure makes them also reflect blue , turquoise , and green light , and they are often iridescent . 
 Structural coloration was first observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton , and its principle – wave interference – explained by Thomas Young a century later . Young described iridescence as the result of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films , combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films . The geometry then determines that at certain angles , the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively , while at other angles , the light interferes destructively . Different colours therefore appear at different angles . 
 In animals such as on the feathers of birds and the scales of butterflies , interference is created by a range of photonic mechanisms , including diffraction gratings , selective mirrors , photonic crystals , crystal fibres , matrices of <unk> and proteins that can vary their configuration . Some cuts of meat also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres . Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy . In plants , brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells . The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue is found in the marble berries of Pollia <unk> , where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces Bragg 's law scattering of light . 
 Structural coloration has potential for industrial , commercial and military application , with biomimetic surfaces that could provide brilliant colours , adaptive camouflage , efficient optical switches and low @-@ reflectance glass . 
 = = History = = 
 In his 1665 book Micrographia , Robert Hooke described the " fantastical " colours of the peacock 's feathers : 
 " The parts of the Feathers of this glorious Bird appear , through the Microscope , no less gaudy then do the whole Feathers ; for , as to the naked eye ' tis evident that the stem or quill of each Feather in the tail sends out multitudes of Lateral branches , … so each of those threads in the Microscope appears a large long body , consisting of a multitude of bright reflecting parts . 
 … their upper sides seem to me to consist of a multitude of thin plated bodies , which are exceeding thin , and lie very close together , and thereby , like mother of Pearl shells , do not onely reflect a very brisk light , but tinge that light in a most curious manner ; and by means of various positions , in respect of the light , they reflect back now one colour , and then another , and those most vividly . Now , that these colours are onely fantastical ones , that is , such as arise immediately from the refractions of the light , I found by this , that water wetting these colour 'd parts , destroy 'd their colours , which seem 'd to proceed from the alteration of the reflection and refraction . " 
 In his 1704 book Opticks , Isaac Newton described the mechanism of the colours other than the brown pigment of peacock tail feathers . Newton noted that 
 " The finely colour 'd Feathers of some Birds , and particularly those of Peacocks Tails , do , in the very same part of the Feather , appear of several Colours in several Positions of the Eye , after the very same manner that thin Plates were found to do in the 7th and 19th Observations , and therefore their Colours arise from the thinness of the transparent parts of the Feathers ; that is , from the slenderness of the very fine Hairs , or <unk> , which grow out of the sides of the grosser lateral Branches or Fibres of those Feathers . " 
 Thomas Young ( 1773 – 1829 ) extended Newton 's particle theory of light by showing that light could also behave as a wave . He showed in 1803 that light could diffract from sharp edges or slits , creating interference patterns . 
 In his 1892 book Animal Coloration , Frank Evers Beddard ( 1858 – 1925 ) acknowledged the existence of structural colours : 
 " The colours of animals are due either solely to the presence of definite pigments in the skin , or … beneath the skin ; or they are partly caused by optical effects due to the scattering , diffraction or unequal refraction of the light rays . Colours of the latter kind are often spoken of as structural colours ; they are caused by the structure of the coloured surfaces . The metallic lustre of the feathers of many birds , such as the humming birds , is due to the presence of excessively fine striae upon the surface of the feathers . " 
 But Beddard then largely dismissed structural coloration , firstly as subservient to pigments : " in every case the [ structural ] colour needs for its display a background of dark pigment ; " and then by asserting its rarity : " By far the commonest source of colour in invertebrate animals is the presence in the skin of definite pigments ... " , though he does later admit that the Cape golden mole has " structural peculiarities " in its hair that " give rise to brilliant colours " . 
 = = Principles = = 
 = = = Structure not pigment = = = 
 Structural coloration is caused by interference effects rather than by pigments . Colours are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines , formed of one or more parallel thin layers , or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the colour 's wavelength . 
 Structural coloration is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds ( the bee @-@ eater , kingfisher and roller , for example ) , as well as many butterfly wings and beetle wing @-@ cases ( elytra ) . These are often iridescent , as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters ( <unk> ) and Nautilus . This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle , which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible . Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours : peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin . 
 = = = Principle of iridescence = = = 
 <unk> , as explained by Thomas Young in 1803 , is created when extremely thin films reflect part of the light falling on them from their top surfaces . The rest of the light goes through the films , and a further part of it is reflected from their bottom surfaces . The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction . But since the bottom @-@ reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film , and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are out of phase . When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles , they add ( interfere constructively ) , giving a strong reflection . At other angles and phase differences , they can subtract , giving weak reflections . The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle , but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles . So , as a thin @-@ film structure like a butterfly 's wing or bird 's feather moves , it seems to change colour . 
 = = Mechanisms = = 
 = = = Fixed structures = = = 
 A number of fixed structures can create structural colours , by mechanisms including diffraction gratings , selective mirrors , photonic crystals , crystal fibres and deformed matrices . Structures can be far more elaborate than a single thin film : films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence , to combine two colours , or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse , less iridescent effect . Each mechanism offers a specific solution to the problem of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions . 
 A diffraction grating constructed of layers of chitin and air gives rise to the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales as well as to the tail feathers of birds such as the peacock . Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock 's colours are created by interference , but the structures responsible , being close to the wavelength of light in scale ( see micrographs ) , were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes . Another way to produce a diffraction grating is with tree @-@ shaped arrays of chitin , as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies ( see drawing ) . Yet another variant exists in <unk> <unk> , Lawes 's <unk> , a bird of paradise . The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V @-@ shaped , creating thin @-@ film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours , bright blue @-@ green and orange @-@ yellow . When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours , rather than drifting <unk> . During courtship , the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females , so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection . 
 <unk> crystals can be formed in different ways . In <unk> <unk> , the emerald @-@ patched <unk> butterfly , photonic crystals are formed of arrays of nano @-@ sized holes in the chitin of the wing scales . The holes have a diameter of about 150 nanometres and are about the same distance apart . The holes are arranged regularly in small patches ; neighbouring patches contain arrays with differing orientations . The result is that these emerald @-@ patched <unk> scales reflect green light evenly at different angles instead of being iridescent . In <unk> augustus , a weevil from Brazil , the chitin exoskeleton is covered in iridescent green oval scales . These contain diamond @-@ based crystal lattices oriented in all directions to give a brilliant green coloration that hardly varies with angle . The scales are effectively divided into pixels about a <unk> wide . Each such pixel is a single crystal and reflects light in a direction different from its neighbours . 
 Selective mirrors to create interference effects are formed of micron @-@ sized bowl @-@ shaped pits lined with multiple layers of chitin in the wing scales of Papilio <unk> , the emerald swallowtail butterfly . These act as highly selective mirrors for two wavelengths of light . Yellow light is reflected directly from the centres of the pits ; blue light is reflected twice by the sides of the pits . The combination appears green , but can be seen as an array of yellow spots surrounded by blue circles under a microscope . 
 Crystal fibres , formed of hexagonal arrays of hollow <unk> , create the bright iridescent colours of the bristles of <unk> , the sea mouse , a non @-@ wormlike genus of marine annelids . The colours are aposematic , warning predators not to attack . The chitin walls of the hollow bristles form a hexagonal honeycomb @-@ shaped photonic crystal ; the hexagonal holes are 0 @.@ 51 <unk> apart . The structure behaves optically as if it consisted of a stack of 88 diffraction gratings , making <unk> one of the most iridescent of marine organisms . 
 <unk> matrices , consisting of randomly oriented <unk> in a <unk> keratin matrix , create the diffuse non @-@ iridescent blue colour of Ara ararauna , the blue @-@ and @-@ yellow macaw . Since the reflections are not all arranged in the same direction , the colours , while still magnificent , do not vary much with angle , so they are not iridescent . 
 Spiral coils , formed of <unk> stacked cellulose <unk> , create Bragg reflection in the " marble berries " of the African herb Pollia <unk> , resulting in the most intense blue coloration known in nature . The berry 's surface has four layers of cells with thick walls , containing spirals of transparent cellulose spaced so as to allow constructive interference with blue light . Below these cells is a layer two or three cells thick containing dark brown tannins . Pollia produces a stronger colour than the wings of Morpho butterflies , and is one of the first instances of structural coloration known from any plant . Each cell has its own thickness of stacked fibres , making it reflect a different colour from its neighbours , and producing a pixellated or pointillist effect with different blues speckled with brilliant green , purple and red dots . The fibres in any one cell are either left @-@ handed or right @-@ handed , so each cell circularly polarizes the light it reflects in one direction or the other . Pollia is the first organism known to show such random polarization of light , which , nevertheless does not have a visual function , as the seed @-@ eating birds that visit this plant species are not able to perceive polarised light . Spiral microstructures are also found in scarab beetles where they produce iridescent colours . 
 Surface gratings , consisting on ordered surface features due exposure of ordered muscle cells on cuts of meat . The structural coloration on meat cuts appears only after the ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils . The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils . <unk> the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse , thus , the structural coloration to disappear . 
 = = = Variable structures = = = 
 Some animals including cephalopods like squid are able to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling . The mechanisms include reversible proteins which can be switched between two configurations . The configuration of <unk> proteins in chromatophore cells in the skin of the Loligo <unk> squid is controlled by electric charge . When charge is absent , the proteins stack together tightly , forming a thin , more reflective layer ; when charge is present , the molecules stack more loosely , forming a thicker layer . Since chromatophores contain multiple <unk> layers , the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected . 
 Blue @-@ ringed octopuses spend much of their time hiding in crevices whilst displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal chromatophore cells . If they are provoked , they quickly change colour , becoming bright yellow with each of the 50 @-@ 60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second . In the greater blue @-@ ringed octopus ( <unk> lunulata ) , the rings contain multi @-@ layer iridophores . These are arranged to reflect blue – green light in a wide viewing direction . The fast flashes of the blue rings are achieved using muscles under neural control . Under normal circumstances , each ring is hidden by contraction of muscles above the iridophores . When these relax and muscles outside the ring contract , the bright blue rings are exposed .

 Structural coloration could be exploited industrially and commercially , and research that could lead to such applications is under way . A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments , just as chameleons and cephalopods do . The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors , enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers . 
 The surface of the compound eye of the housefly is densely packed with microscopic projections that have the effect of reducing reflection and hence increasing transmission of incident light . Similarly , the eyes of some moths have <unk> surfaces , again using arrays of pillars smaller than the wavelength of light . " Moth @-@ eye " nanostructures could be used to create low @-@ reflectance glass for windows , solar cells , display devices , and military stealth technologies . <unk> biomimetic surfaces using the " moth @-@ eye " principle can be manufactured by first creating a mask by lithography with gold nanoparticles , and then performing reactive @-@ ion etching .

 The Central Troy Historic District is an irregularly shaped , 96 @-@ acre ( 39 ha ) area of downtown Troy , New York , United States . It has been described as " one of the most perfectly preserved 19th @-@ century downtowns in the [ country ] " with nearly 700 properties in a variety of architectural styles from the early 19th to mid @-@ 20th centuries . These include most of Russell Sage College , one of two privately owned urban parks in New York , and two National Historic Landmarks . Visitors ranging from the Duke de la Rochefoucauld to Philip Johnson have praised aspects of it . Martin Scorsese used parts of downtown Troy as a stand @-@ in for 19th @-@ century Manhattan in The Age of Innocence . 
 In 1986 , it was added to the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) , superseding five smaller historic districts that had been listed on the Register in the early 1970s . ( Two years later , in 1988 , the extension of the previous River Street Historic District north of Federal Street was added separately to the NRHP as the Northern River Street Historic District . ) In late 2014 , the State Historic Preservation Board began considering an adjustment to the district 's boundaries that would be a net expansion , particularly in its southeast . ; that increase was made official in <unk> name = " Boundary increase announcement " / > Most of the buildings , structures and objects within the district contribute to its historic character . Two of Troy 's four National Historic Landmarks , the Gurley Building and Troy Savings Bank , are located within its boundaries . Nine other buildings are listed on the Register in their own right . Among the architects represented are Alexander Jackson Davis , George B. Post , Calvert Vaux and Frederick Clarke Withers . There are many buildings designed by the regionally significant architect Marcus F. Cummings . The downtown street plan was borrowed from Philadelphia , and one neighborhood , Washington Square , was influenced by London 's squares of its era . 
 The district reflects Troy 's evolution from its origins as a Hudson River port into an early industrial center built around textile manufacture and steelmaking . During this period it was rebuilt twice in the wake of two devastating fires , resulting in its mix of architecture styles . After the decline of its industries in the mid @-@ 20th century , downtown Troy was threatened by urban renewal efforts that galvanized local preservationists , leading to the early NRHP listings and eventually the creation of the district . 
 Today , the city of Troy protects and preserves the district with special provisions in its zoning and programs which , with assistance from the state of New York , encourage and subsidize property owners who maintain and restore historic buildings . These efforts have paid off with increased attention from developers , the revival of much of the area , and praise from visitors to the city . With the collaboration of nearby Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ( RPI ) , Troy is hoping to make the district a center for the development of cutting @-@ edge technologies , a " Silicon Valley of the 19th century . "

 The district boundary was drawn to include the highest concentration of historic resources . The street plan dates to 1787 and the most recent historic building dates to 1940 , making those years the period of significance . While some newer buildings are inevitably located within the area , the boundary , where possible , excluded significant mid and late 20th @-@ century buildings like the city hall , low @-@ income housing projects , and the Uncle Sam Atrium , a large shopping mall downtown . All of the original five historic districts are included in full , along with other historic neighborhoods , for a total of 10 % of the city 's area . 
 It is centered around the axes of US 4 and NY 2 , both of which divide into one @-@ way streets ( Third and Fourth and Congress and Ferry , respectively ) to facilitate traffic flow through the city . Monument Square , the center of Troy since the late 19th century , along with all the buildings around it ( save for the late 20th @-@ century , brutalist City Hall , demolished in 2011 ) are located within its northwestern corner . At its western end it is partially bounded by the Hudson River , and the former River Street Historic District . 
 To the south it includes the older buildings of Russell Sage College , Washington Square Park and the houses on Adams Street , the district 's southern boundary . The mostly regular southeastern boundary follows Clinton Street until it reaches Ferry . Then it becomes ragged and irregular , reaching the district 's northernmost extent at the former Grand Street Historic District . This extension allows it to include as well the Gurley Building and its surrounding neighborhood , formerly the Fifth Street @-@ Fulton Street Historic District . 
 To the east of the district Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ( RPI ) , Troy 's most notable institution of higher learning , is situated on a low rise overlooking downtown . RPI has played an increasing role in the district in recent years , and now owns several notable buildings . 
 The entire district is densely developed , primarily residential in its northern and southern portions , with commercial use concentrated in central blocks near Monument Square . The only significant open spaces within it are the one @-@ block Washington Park near its southern end and Seminary Park , the main quad at Russell Sage . Most of the major streets and the central area of the district are lined with multi @-@ story dwellings that are primarily commercial but with a mix of office and residential space on their upper floors . On the side streets , there are smaller @-@ scale residential townhouses . Institutional use is limited to Russell Sage , a few churches , RPI 's buildings and governmental structures like the county courthouse and post office . No industrial use , past or present , is within the district , with the notable exception of the Gurley Building , and even that has been scaled back in recent years .

 In 2014 the State Historic Preservation Board considered a boundary adjustment that removes a small area at the northeast corner but adds far more , primarily at the southeast . It would include a total of 200 new contributing properties and extend the district 's period of significance to 1978 , to take into account the city 's urban renewal era . Most of the new areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated . Two years later the National Park Service officially approved the expansion . 
 The most significant change to the district is the extension on the southeast , to the boundary of the city 's Eighth Ward in 1870 . Between Adams and Ferry streets , three blocks would be added , with the new boundary following the west side of St. Mary 's Avenue , excluding a newer house at the northwest corner of the Washington Avenue intersection , and then rear property lines to Kennedy Lane and Hill Street just south of Adams . Two @-@ story rowhouses predominate in this area , many built as worker housing during the 19th century , some as early as the Federal period . Some have intact storefronts . It also has the only significant industrial building in the proposed expanded district , the former Lusco Paper Works on the northwest corner of Fifth and Liberty streets . The area has begun to see some restoration efforts , such as some Greek Revival rowhouses on Liberty Street near Fourth , which will benefit from state tax credits should the area be added to the district . 
 On the west side the boundary would be extended a block , from First to River Street at the Congress Street Bridge approaches , between Division and Ferry streets . This includes a large brick dorm complex built by Russell Sage College ( RSC ) in the early 1960s . It was the college 's last large @-@ scale construction project in the city ; with its inclusion all of RSC would be within the district . To its south another proposed extension reaches across a small park on First to include the 1905 Beth <unk> synagogue , a neoclassical brick structure that retains most of its integrity . 
 Two other changes take in other significant buildings . Along the north side of Ferry at the district 's east , just north of the Eighth Ward addition , the boundary would be extended east , taking in another set of rowhouses on the west side of Fifth and the city 's former jail and sheriff 's office at the northeast corner of Ferry and Fifth . On the north , the Uncle Sam Atrium shopping mall and parking garage complex , occupying most of the block between Broadway and Third , Fourth and Fulton streets would now be included . Built in 1978 , it is the only significant example of modern architecture in the district and the last large @-@ scale project built in downtown Troy . 
 Other , smaller areas proposed for inclusion are a group of brick houses , some of them blighted along the south side of Washington Street between First Street Alley and River , a rowhouse and community garden on the corners of Adams Street and Second Street Alley , and another group of rowhouses along the west side of Fifth Street between State and Congress streets . The only areas proposed for removal are large portions of the blocks on the west side of Sixth Avenue on either side of Fulton . At the time the district was established , they were occupied by large industrial buildings . Both were later demolished , and have been replaced by parking lots . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of the Central Troy Historic District is , particularly in its earlier years , the history of Troy itself . Until the later 19th century , the present downtown area was the city . Two devastating fires , along with changes in the economy brought about by industrialization , shaped the district into today 's architecturally diverse downtown . 
 = = = Pre @-@ industrial years = = = 
 Prior to independence , there had only been a few scattered Dutch farmers settled on the Hudson above Albany . In 1787 , a group of New Englanders headed west and persuaded one Jacob <unk> to sell them a large tract which they then subdivided and named Troy . The dividing line between two of the family 's farms was called Grand Division Street , later shortened to Grand Street . 
 They based its grid @-@ like street plan on Philadelphia 's , with numbered north @-@ south streets running inland from the river after River Street , the city 's first commercial center . Lots there , at the time , ran all the way to the river 's waterline , giving their owners the unusual advantage of river and street frontage . The sloping bluff also allowed them to build multi @-@ story warehouses and granaries closer to the unloading points along the river . 
 In 1793 , the new settlement was designated the Rensselaer County seat . Two years later , the visiting Duke de la Rochefoucauld noted the " neat and numerous houses " and active businesses engaged in river @-@ based trade . " The sight of this activity is truly charming " , he said , in one of the earliest published descriptions of the city . In 1798 Troy incorporated as a village . 
 The village 's population more than tripled in the first 15 years of the new century , leading it to reincorporate as a city in 1816 . With River Street getting built out , banks began taking advantage of the street plan and locating on First Street , previously a residential area . By 1807 , another visitor from abroad , British painter John Lambert , described a town that had already grown considerably from what de la Rochefoucauld saw a dozen years earlier : 
 Troy is a well built town , consisting chiefly of one street of handsome red brick houses ... There are two or three short streets which branch off from the main one , but it is in the latter that all of the principal stores , warehouses and shops are situated . It also contains several excellent inns and taverns . The houses are all new and lofty and built with much taste and simplicity , though convenience and accommodation seem to have guided the architect more than ornament . The deep red bricks , well pointed , give the buildings an air of neatness and cleanliness seldom met in old towns . 
 Little of that Troy remains due to an 1820 fire which started in a First Street stable and eventually consumed much of the extant village . A column at 225 River Street bears a stone indicating that this was where the fire was stopped after it had gone on for weeks . Unlike its classical namesake , Troy rebuilt quickly , with newer brick homes and commercial buildings , built to stricter standards , replacing the old ones and expanding again . The Hart @-@ Cluett Mansion , an 1827 Federal style house on Second Street , is one of the best surviving buildings from this era . Although previously attributed to Philip Hooker new research has determined that the house 's architect was Martin Euclid Thompson and the builder was John Bard Colegrove . 
 = = = Industrialization and growth = = = 
 In 1824 , a gazetteer of the state echoed earlier accounts in calling River Street " the mart of business " . The same year , RPI was founded on the hill to the east of downtown , to train engineers for the city 's burgeoning industrial sector . The relationship between the city and university would later become significant in preserving the historic district . 
 This growth would continue due to transportation improvements in the 1820s . Troy 's businessmen had already built a turnpike to Schenectady , the path followed today by Route 2 from Troy to Colonie . These trade routes were enhanced by the Erie and Champlain canals , which opened new markets to the north and west , while the Troy Steamboat Company 's debut did likewise for the south . The access to iron ore mines in the Adirondack Mountains also got some local businessmen into iron refining . In 1835 the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad brought that technology to the city , and in 1842 the completion of the Schenectady and Troy Railroad linked Troy to the vast network that reached as far west as Buffalo . 
 The stage was set for Troy 's industrialization . The development of the detachable collar by Hannah Lord Montague in 1827 had given the city the product that still lends it its " Collar City " nickname . Plants were built to manufacture them commercially , as well as cuffs and other textile products . Most of these were located to the north of the downtown area , as it was continuing to grow as the city 's commercial district and residential area for the well @-@ to @-@ do of the time along Second Street . 
 With the newer money and newer neighborhoods came newer architectural trends . St. Paul 's Episcopal Church , built in 1827 , is an early Gothic Revival church , based on Ithiel Town 's Trinity Church in New Haven , Connecticut . Eight years later , Town himself would design the Cannon Building in collaboration with Alexander Jackson Davis . 
 Greek Revival residences were first built in Troy along Second Street in the late 1820s . In 1839 , six local businessmen bought a parcel of land between Second and Third at the south end of what was then the developed area of the city and created Washington Park . Modeled on contemporary British residential squares such as those found in London 's Bloomsbury neighborhoods , its first phase , on Washington Place , featured rows of townhouses with a unified facade fronting on a park reserved exclusively for residents , whose deeds require a monthly maintenance fee . It retains its integrity despite some later alterations and damage , and is one of only two privately owned urban parks in New York . 
 In 1843 , another group of planned Greek Revival townhouses was built at 160 @-@ 168 Second Street . Unusual for urban houses , they featured one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ story porticos on their front facades , with Ionic columns , and ( originally ) side yards . Another house was built at 170 , several years later , in a similar style . They were widely imitated elsewhere in the city . 
 The city 's industries reached their peak in the 1850s , and the wealth it created explored new architectural trends . The emerging Italianate style began to make its mark , particularly in commercial buildings around Monument Square and along " Bankers ' Row " , First between State and River . St. Paul 's Place was built around 1850 on the south side of State between Fourth and Fifth . Following the dictates of the Washington Park @-@ area deeds , the houses were built with a unified facade as well as a central parapet . The Gilbert Mansion on Second Street west of Washington Park is the most significant detached Italianate home from that era . 
 Russell Sage built a row of Gothic Revival houses on Second Street in 1846 that survives , albeit without some of their original ornamentation . On the edges of town , some architects began exploring that style 's Picturesque mode . A new row of townhouses at Washington Park went up , and another Second Street row followed in 1855 . The following year , St. John 's Episcopal Church , at First and Liberty streets , was the first use of that style for a city church . 
 During the Civil War , Troy 's industries played a key role in supporting the Union cause . The Burden Ironworks is said to have supplied all the Union Army 's horseshoes , and another local ironworks supplied the USS Monitor 's hull plating . Its owners would later produce the first Bessemer process steel in the United States after the war . 
 In 1862 Troy suffered another major fire , the worst in its history . A locomotive 's spark ignited the wooden Green Island drawbridge that existed at the time , and when that could not be contained to the bridge it spread to the east , ultimately devastating 507 buildings over a 16 @-@ block area . As before , the city rebuilt quickly , with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street , where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth , most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction . The Gurley Building , too , rose in just eight months from the ashes of its predecessor . The nearby neighborhood also became desirable , with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth . 
 = = = Postwar prosperity = = = 
 As the postwar years yielded to the Gilded Age , Troy 's prosperity continued . The wealth created by its industries built some of the city 's most notable Victorian buildings . Frederick Clarke Withers designed First Street 's Rice Building in 1871 , a five @-@ story flatiron @-@ shaped building representative of his Victorian Gothic style . The Cannon Building got a contemporary mansard roof after two fires . Cummings ' 1870 Congregation <unk> Sholom Temple on Third Street is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States , the oldest Reform synagogue in New York , and one of the most significant religious buildings in the district from this period . In 1875 , George B. Post won a competition to build a new home for the Troy Savings Bank , with an upstairs auditorium . While his building was in the Renaissance Revival style of the time , its forms and decorations anticipated his later work in the Beaux @-@ Arts vein . 
 The Panic of 1873 put a damper on this growth , and in the interim the city 's steel industry began to decline , squeezed by competition from newer , more efficient producers in Western Pennsylvania and the Midwest on one side and labor unrest at home . But the textile industry remained strong , and even grew . Accordingly , its residents continued to embrace new movements in architecture . The 1880 pharmacy building at 137 Second Street featured a highly decorated cast iron storefront and curved windows showing the influence of the Queen Anne Style . Further down Second Street , industrialist Jonas <unk> 's house built that same year is one of the best residential applications of the same style . 
 Cummings explored the Richardsonian Romanesque mode in several of his buildings at Russell Sage . The Paine Mansion at 49 Second Street applied the same style , with arcaded entrance loggia and corner tower , to a home . The brick drugstore annex at 155 @-@ 157 River Street is a particularly representative commercial example of the style . In 1893 the World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago popularized the Classical and Renaissance revivals and Beaux @-@ Arts style . They came to Troy very quickly when Marcus Cummings and his son Frederick designed the Classical Revival county courthouse at 80 Second Street , the third to occupy the site , the following year . A short distance away three years later , the Renaissance Revival Hart Memorial Library was built of Vermont marble , joining the similarly styled 1895 Frear Mansion , also on Second Street . 
 As the 20th century dawned , builders and architects concentrated their efforts in the northern half of the district , primarily on commercial structures as the downtown area was no longer popular as a place for new residences . Monument Square , created in 1891 when a statue of Columbia was erected atop the Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Monument in the triangular area formed by the intersection of Broadway , River and Second streets , became a new focal point of development . There the McCarthy Building on Monument Square , and the similar National State Bank and Ilium buildings on Broadway , all built in 1904 , show the decorative influence of the era 's revival styles . Proctor 's Theater , ten years later on Fourth Street , continued the tradition . 
 Other architects chose the era 's simpler styles , like Arts and Crafts , as a contrast . The marble @-@ and @-@ brick 1905 YMCA building on Second Street , and the six @-@ story Caldwell Apartments at State and Second streets are two of the district 's best examples of that style . The latter building , built in 1907 , was also the first large @-@ scale apartment building in the city . The Colonial Revival style would also leave its mark in Troy with several buildings . Most notable among them is the Hendrick Hudson Hotel on the east side of Monument Square , a six @-@ story structure that was the largest building ever built in the city at the time . Projects of similar scale , and the city 's annexation of the village of Lansingburgh to its north , helped swell its population to over 72 @,@ 000 in 1930 , its <unk> peak .
