 = California State Route 195 = 
 State Route 195 ( SR 195 ) was a state highway in the U.S. state of California , branching westward from SR 111 to SR 86 near the town of Mecca and the Salton Sea . The route formerly extended east to Interstate 10 ( I @-@ 10 ) near Joshua Tree National Park as a longer route extending to Blythe and points further east . After the main route was shifted north , the older route remained as an alternate known as Box Canyon Road . The route was designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering , although the Box Canyon Road portion was removed as a state highway in 1972 . Following the construction of the SR 86 expressway , SR 195 was curtailed in 2009 , and removed entirely in 2014 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Before the route was mostly removed in 2009 , it began at Harrison Street , the old routing of SR 86 , in Riverside County . It then headed north as Pierce Street until intersecting 66th Street , where SR 195 turned east . The highway intersected SR 86 and continued to the town of Mecca , where it met its north end at SR 111 . The route loosely paralleled the northern end of the Salton Sea , passing through farmland for its entire length . 
 In 2013 , SR 195 had an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 4500 at Buchanan Street , and 6 @,@ 000 at the eastern terminus with SR 111 , the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway . 
 = = History = = 
 Route 64 , a highway from Mecca to Blythe , was added to the state highway system in 1919 . In 1935 , Pierce Street from Route 26 near Oasis to Avenue 66 , and Avenue 66 from Route 26 to Mecca were added to the state highway system . Two years later , Pierce Street was designated as Route 203 , and Avenue 66 was designated as Route 204 . By 1926 , the road existed east of Mecca to Blythe , but was unpaved ; by 1930 , the road connected from Mecca to the road along the western side of the Salton Sea to Indio and points further west . 
 Between 1932 and 1934 , the road east of Mecca had been paved . The western part of the road , known as the Box Canyon road , from Mecca to Blythe served as part of US 60 and US 70 until it was eventually bypassed in favor of a more direct route to Indio , diverging at Shavers ' Summit . Between 1934 and 1936 , US 60 and US 70 had made the shift north towards Indio , and the portion between US 99 and Mecca was paved . Initial opposition was later overcome after the road was washed out during a storm and forced motorists to take refuge in the nearby foothills . By 1940 , the SR 195 designation was signed . In the 1940s , the highway continued due west of Mecca to end at an intersection with US 99 , rather than turning south . 
 In 1953 , efforts to remove the road from Mecca to the highway from Blythe to Indio , from the state highway system were met with community opposition , since it served as an alternate route for the other highway . State Senator Nelson Dilworth proposed legislation to require the road from Banning through Idyllwild to Mountain Center to be added to the state highway system if SR 195 was removed , as the two were of roughly the same length , but the latter remained in the system . 
 SR 195 was officially designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering . The original alignment continued past SR 111 and the Salton Sea before ending at US 60 , which later became I @-@ 10 , at the southern end of Joshua Tree National Park . The Division of Highways proposed deleting this part of the state highway in 1971 , though similar plans had been revived in 1969 . This portion was removed in 1972 . 
 In 1988 , the California Transportation Commission ( CTC ) approved shifting SR 111 onto the new SR 86 expressway after it was completed , using SR 195 to make the connection . When the SR 86 expressway was fully constructed , SR 195 was to be removed from the state highway system according to state law ; that expressway was finished in 2001 . However , this removed the connection from the highway portion of SR 111 to the new expressway carrying both SR 111 and SR 86 north from the state highway system . Caltrans officially deleted most of SR 195 in 2009 , leaving a gap in SR 111 following deletions of the old routing that was now bypassed by the expressway . In December 2014 , with Riverside County and Caltrans both supporting , the CTC transferred the remaining portion of SR 195 , from the new SR 86 expressway to SR 111 , to become part of SR 111 . SR 195 still appears in Caltrans documents dated from 2014 .

 = 66th Division ( United Kingdom ) = 
 The 66th ( 2nd East Lancashire ) Division was an infantry division of the British Army , part of the Territorial Force , which saw service in the trenches of the Western Front , during the later years of the Great War . Disbanded after the war , it was reformed in 1939 in the Territorial Army as the 66th Infantry Division but disbanded in 1940 , without seeing active service in the Second World War . 
 The division was created shortly after the outbreak of the First World War at the end of August 1914 , as the 2nd East Lancashire Division , a second @-@ line formation of the East Lancashire Division , composed primarily of soldiers from eastern Lancashire and the industrial towns around Manchester . After training and home service , it deployed to the Western Front in early 1917 ; its first major combat came in October of that year , at the Battle of Poelcappelle . In March 1918 , it suffered extremely heavy losses during Operation Michael the German Spring Offensive and was withdrawn from the line and reduced to a cadre to be rebuilt . It returned to the front in time for the Battle of Cambrai , part of the Hundred Days Offensive and the Battle of the Selle . Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 , it was stationed in Belgium , where it was demobilised in March 1919 . 
 The division was not reformed after the war but was reconstituted as the 66th Infantry Division ( with no regional title ) , again as a duplicate of the 42nd Division , during the hurried expansion of the Territorial Army in early 1939 . It was active for slightly over a year , before being disbanded in June 1940 , having only seen home service with most of its component units being transferred to other divisions .

 = = = Formation and home service = = = 
 The division was created at the end of August 1914 , as the 2nd East Lancashire Division , a second @-@ line formation of the East Lancashire Division . Territorial Force soldiers could not be deployed overseas without their consent and the Territorial units were accordingly split into a " first line " , with men who had volunteered for overseas service and a " second line " , which was intended for home service , by the ten percent who refused to volunteer on 12 August . The second line units also served to absorb the large number of recruits who had joined the Territorial Force following the outbreak of war . The first commander was Brigadier @-@ General Charles Beckett , a 65 @-@ year @-@ old retired officer , who had commanded a Yeomanry brigade some years earlier . 
 As with the original East Lancashire Division , the 2nd East Lancashire was organised in three infantry brigades of four battalions each . These were later numbered as the 197th ( Lancashire Fusiliers ) Brigade , composed of the 2 / 5th , 2 / 6th , 2 / 7th and 2 / 8th Lancashire Fusiliers ; the 198th ( East Lancashire ) Brigade , composed of the 2 / 4th and 2 / 5th East Lancashire Regiment and the 2 / 9th and 2 / 10th Manchester Regiment ; and the 199th ( Manchester ) Brigade , composed of the 2 / 5th , 2 / 6th , 2 / 7th and 2 / 8th Manchester Regiment . The 197th Brigade drew its men from Bury and Salford , Greater Manchester ; the 198th Brigade from Blackburn , Burnley Ashton @-@ under @-@ Lyne and Oldham and the 199th Brigade from Wigan , Manchester and Ardwick . The division also raised second @-@ line Territorial artillery , Royal Army Medical Corps and Royal Engineer units , all from the Lancashire – Manchester recruiting area and had an attached squadron of the Bedfordshire Yeomanry . 
 For two years , the 2nd East Lancashire Division ( numbered the 66th Division in August 1915 ) , provided trained replacements for its parent unit and carried out home defence duties in England . Elements of the division assembled near Southport in late 1914 , then moved south to the Kent – Sussex area in May 1915 and to Essex in early 1916 . In early 1915 , the 2 / 5th Lancashire Fusiliers , a second @-@ line battalion , was detached for overseas service and joined the 51st ( Highland ) Division . The battalion was replaced by another duplicate battalion , the 3 / 5th Lancashire Fusiliers , which became one of the few third @-@ line territorial battalions to see active service . One of the three companies of Royal Engineers , was sent to France in 1915 to join the 48th ( South Midland ) Division and during 1916 , three of the four heavy and howitzer artillery batteries were withdrawn or broken up . Following the Military Service Act of January 1916 , all Territorial soldiers were deemed to liable for overseas service and in February 1917 , the 66th Division was instructed to prepare for a move to continental Europe and received a new and experienced commander , Major @-@ General Herbert Lawrence . 
 = = = Flanders and Poelcappelle , 1917 = = = 
 The division arrived in France in early 1917 as part of the last batch of second @-@ line Territorial divisions to be sent from Britain , and was attached to the First Army . On 12 April , Brigadier @-@ General Godfrey Matthews , a former Royal Marine officer commanding 198th Brigade , was wounded by shellfire and died the next day . In June , the division was transferred to the XV Corps of the Fourth Army on the relatively quiet coastal sector in Flanders . During the summer , XV Corps was held ready for Operation Hush , an amphibious landing by the 1st Division and a coastal offensive by the rest of XV Corps , which was planned to support an advance from Passchendaele Ridge east of Ypres , by the Fifth Army . The operation was postponed several times and was cancelled in October . At the end of September , the 66th Division was relieved by its parent unit , the 42nd ( East Lancashire ) Division . After a few days of overlap , where many men were able to meet friends and relations they had not seen since 1914 , the division moved south to the Ypres area . The division was assigned to II Anzac Corps , a predominantly Australian formation and the 199th Brigade moved into the front line to replace the 3rd Australian Division on 5 October . The relief was badly mismanaged , leaving the Australian staff officers doubtful of the efficiency of the division . On 9 October , the division made its debut in the Battle of Poelcappelle . 
 On the night of 8 / 9 October , the 197th and 198th brigades had begun to cover the 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) to the front line , which usually took about 1 1 ⁄ 2 hours . Despite starting ten hours before the attack , the 197th Brigade was late . At zero hour , the 198th Brigade attacked on the left flank of the divisional front , into defences which had been little damaged by the artillery bombardment , advancing behind a meagre creeping barrage and were held up 300 yards ( 270 m ) short of the first objective . The 197th Brigade arrived late on the right flank , exhausted and disorganised after a twelve @-@ hour march through mud but attacked as soon as it arrived . The brigade rapidly advanced over drier sandy ground and reached the final objective , 700 yards ( 640 m ) short of Passchendaele village at 10 : 00 a.m. ; an officer 's patrol entered the village and found it empty . Around midday , the 197th Brigade battalions near the village withdrew their flanks , to gain touch with the units on either side at the first objective ; the troops in the centre misinterpreted this and also withdrew the same distance . A German counter @-@ attack was repulsed at 5 : 10 p.m. and before nightfall , the divisional commander ordered a short withdrawal , to link with the 49th Division on the left and to avoid enfilade fire from the Bellevue Spur . The brigade ended the day 500 yards ( 460 m ) beyond the start line for the loss of 3 @,@ 119 casualties ; the division was relieved by the 3rd Australian Division on the night of 10 / 11 October . 
 A second senior officer was killed in action , when Brigadier @-@ General Arthur Lowe , commanding the divisional artillery , was killed near Ypres on 24 November . In late December 1917 , a new commanding officer , Major @-@ General Neill Malcolm was appointed to the 66th Division . Malcolm was a decorated veteran of several colonial wars , who had served in staff posts since being wounded in the Second Boer War and had most recently served as chief of staff of the Fifth Army . The division was reorganised over the winter , with the brigade machine @-@ gun companies being consolidated into a battalion and a pioneer battalion , the 1 / 5th Border Regiment joining the division . The most substantial change was the loss of three battalions , the 3 / 5th Lancashire Fusiliers and 2 / 8th and 2 / 10th Manchester Regiment , one from each brigade . This was a change made in all British divisions , to bring the remaining battalions in France up to strength and to increase the ratio of artillery to infantry . At this point , there was a general exchange of men between the 42nd and 66th Divisions ; the core of the 1 / 6th Lancashire Fusiliers , 1 / 4th East Lancashires , and 1 / 9th Manchesters were transferred to the 66th Division , where they amalgamated with their second @-@ line counterparts , while the 42nd Division received the men from the disbanded battalions in the 66th Division . The division remained in the Passchendaele area until February 1918 . 
 = = = Battle of St. Quentin = = = 
 In March 1918 , the 66th Division was assigned to XIX Corps in the Fifth Army , holding an area north of Saint @-@ Quentin , bordering the 24th Division of XIX Corps on the right and 16th ( Irish ) Division of VII Corps on the left . The corps sector was between the River Cologne in the north and the Omicron in the south . Under a new defence in depth scheme , small strongpoints in a " forward zone " was to delay and disrupt an attack , harassing it with machine @-@ gun fire . The main body of the division remained in a " battle zone " further back , to make local counter @-@ attacks into the forward zone or in reserve in a third " rear zone " . The British were used to deliberate attacks in trench warfare conditions , not the rapid counter @-@ attacks on the defensive that the German army had perfected since early 1915 and felt vulnerable in what they saw as exposed positions . Combat units were still kept too close to the front line ( across the front , 84 percent of battalions were in the two forward zones ) , leaving them vulnerable to an attack and a lack of manpower meant that very few of the defensive positions necessary for the scheme to work had been prepared in the rear zone of the Fifth Army . 
 On the morning of 21 March , the German spring offensive began at the Battle of St. Quentin . Elements of the German 25th Division and 208th Division attacked through a thick fog at dawn , overrunning the two battalions ( 4th East Lancashires and 2 / 8th Lancashire Fusiliers ) which held positions in the forward zone . By 10 @.@ 30 am , they had reached the " battle zone " , where the fighting intensified . On the right flank , near the boundary with 24th Division , a reserve company of 2 / 7th Manchesters held a defensive position from 11 : 00 am to 7 : 00 pm , when they surrendered , having lost 70 percent casualties and run out of ammunition . To their left , the 2 / 6th Manchesters held out until the early afternoon , when the 160 survivors were forced to retreat further into the battle zone . The northern element of the division 's defensive plan was a fortified quarry outside the village of <unk> @-@ le @-@ <unk> , held by the 2 / 7th Lancashire Fusiliers and 1 / 5th Border Regiment but this had been quickly surrounded and bypassed by the attackers , to be mopped up later in the day , with only a few men escaping . The village was defended by the 2 / 6th Lancashire Fusiliers and an artillery battery ; in the course of the day , the battery was destroyed while the fusiliers were pushed back towards the edge of the village , clinging on to their positions as night fell . During the day , 711 men of 66th Division had been killed ; while detailed figures are not available this would suggest around 1 @,@ 000 men were wounded and another 2 @,@ 000 captured . British casualties for the day were 7 @,@ 500 killed , 10 @,@ 000 wounded and 21 @,@ 000 captured ; 66th Division is known to have lost 711 men killed . 
 On the morning of 22 March , German attacks continued to push back the remaining units of the 66th Division , now supported by the 1st Cavalry Division and a handful of tanks . The composite force managed a fighting retreat , with most units avoiding encirclement . Shortly after noon the remnants of the division were ordered to retreat behind the 50th ( Northumbrian ) Division , which were preparing fresh defences on the original Green Line along the edge of the rear zone . The 66th Division retreated through the new defensive line by 4 : 00 pm , with the aid of the 5th Durham Light Infantry ( DLI ) , which had been temporarily transferred to support them and the 50th Division took over the front line . Over the following days , the divisions of XIX Corps fell back towards the line of the River Somme , where the 66th Division ( plus the 5th DLI ) took up positions on the west bank of the river around <unk> and <unk> @-@ en @-@ Santerre , west of Peronne . On 24 March , the German army crossed the Somme and the 2 / 8th Lancashire Fusiliers counter @-@ attacked the bridgeheads without success but continued to hold a line close to the river . Expecting a follow @-@ up attack the next day , 149th Brigade was temporarily attached to 66th Division and both units were slowly pushed back from the banks of the Somme , withdrawing to <unk> as night fell on 25 March . 
 The remnants of the 66th Division were holding a position south of the Somme , with the 50th Division to the right and troops from the Third Army over the river to the left . An attack on the morning of 26 March , opening the Battle of Rosières , pushed back the units on the north bank and the 66th Division retired , losing contact with the 50th Division , which fell back on Rosières @-@ en @-@ Santerre to avoid being flanked . " Little 's Composite Battalion " with the remaining troops of the 198th Brigade , moved from reserve to <unk> and defended the village until the early afternoon , retired to <unk> and then filled a 3 @,@ 000 @-@ yard ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) gap between the 66th and 39th divisions . The battalion had been formed from stragglers and reinforcement drafts by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel W. B. Little , commander of 1 / 5th Borders , who had been on leave when the German offensive began and moved up towards the front line during 25 March . Other British troops were north of the 66th Division around <unk> and by that night , the line south of the Somme was held by 16th , 39th , 66th and 50th divisions . The battle continued continued on 27 March , with the 66th Division pushed back to <unk> . That night , the division took up positions between <unk> and <unk> , facing north on a line of about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) . The three brigade headquarters had moved forward to reinforce the front line ; until the 66th Division was reorganised later in the year , casualties were so numerous that the brigade structure was not reformed and the brigadiers took turns to command the infantry . On the morning of 28 March , a German attack broke through at <unk> and the 66th Division retreated south to Cayeux @-@ en @-@ Santerre , with the 39th Division on the left . By nightfall , the line had been pushed back to <unk> , a few miles from Amiens . 
 Elements of the division remained in the fighting line as late as 30 March , when they fought in a counter @-@ attack near <unk> under the command of one of the 66th Division brigadiers . The division was relieved by part of the 18th Division on the night of 30 / 31 March . After ten days ' fighting , only 2 @,@ 500 men remained in the division and it had almost ceased to function as an organised unit . Two of the three infantry brigades and eight of the twelve infantry battalions had lost their commanders and the front @-@ line strength was reduced to 1 @,@ 200 riflemen , fewer than a company per battalion . A proposal to disband the division was discussed in the first week of April but quickly rejected . On 29 March , near <unk> @-@ lès @-@ <unk> , Malcolm had been badly wounded in his good leg ( he was lame in the other , following an injury in South Africa ) and left the division to recover , command being taken temporarily by Brigadier @-@ General A. J. Hunter . On 31 March , Keppel Bethell , who had commanded the New Army 74th Brigade in the 25th Division since October 1916 , was promoted to take over the division . At 35 , Bethell became the youngest man to command a division during the war ; while a temporary Major @-@ General , he still held the substantive rank of captain . 
 A driven and mercurial figure , Bethell inspired both admiration and loathing from his contemporaries , who saw him as an outstanding commander but with a furious and often unjustified , temper . During his time at 74th Brigade , relations with his staff had diminished to the point where they refused to take meals with him . He also believed in commandeering from other units and after leaving 25th Division , he repeatedly returned to poach staff officers and battalion commanders . The 74th Brigade would later provide the new divisional <unk> , Walter Guinness ( transferred after Bethell 's intervention to the Chief of Staff at army headquarters ) and the <unk> , John Marriott ( simply taken by Bethell from hospital ) . This approach extended to reorganising his new command . On 2 April , Bethell sent Gordon Macready , the divisional <unk> , to acquire several hundred guns in order to reform the 66th Division as a machine @-@ gun division , an idea that appears to have been entirely Bethell 's own . After raiding other divisions and emptying the Machine Gun Corps training school , Bethell reported to Field Marshal Douglas Haig that the division was ready to return to combat ; he was surprised to find that his friend " Duggie " disapproved of these methods , rejected the proposal and informed him that his division would instead be withdrawn and used as a training unit . Bethell was later offered a new division but chose to remain in the 66th Division , hoping that it would return to the front lines at a later date . 
 = = = Reconstitution = = = 
 Following its losses , the 66th Division was reduced to cadre early in May ; which meant that infantry battalions were cut to ten officers and about 45 men , the surplus being sent to base depots ; the artillery , engineer and machine @-@ gun units were distributed among other formations . The divisional artillery was attached to XIX Corps during the Battle of the <unk> on 4 April and with XI Corps at the Battle of the Lys later in the month . During the summer , Bethell continued planning for the rebuilding of the division , having recruited a staff he felt he could work with , expecting that experienced men would become available as drafts returned from the Mediterranean . Overseas divisions there had suffered fewer casualties and the reduction from four to three battalions per brigade meant that large numbers of men would be returning . While reinforcements were assembled , the divisional cadres of the 66th Division and the 39th Division were used to train five American divisions in the British zone . The training process was complicated by a rigid schedule laid down by the American high command , who strongly objected to any deviation from their plans . In July , the American divisions moved up to the front and British troops began to arrive from Salonika and Palestine , though the assembly of the division was delayed by the returning men being given home leave and having to spend time <unk> . 
 The division had a complicated organisational history during this period , with a large number of units being attached or withdrawn for short periods , while others were merged or disbanded . About thirty infantry battalions were attached for short periods and the divisional artillery and supply columns remained in support of the front line , while one ambulance company was later transferred to serve with the American 27th Division . The future of the division was again in doubt by early September ; the 197th Brigade had been transferred to a training role and the division was expected to be disbanded . Bethell argued for retaining the division and was ordered to prepare it for front @-@ line service ; the 197th Brigade was replaced by the South African Brigade to bring the division back up to strength . By the end of September , following amalgamations and reorganisation , the division was left with the South African Brigade ( 1st , 2nd , and 4th South African Infantry regiments ) , the 198th Brigade ( 5th Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers , 6th Royal Dublin Fusiliers and 6th Lancashire Fusiliers ) and the 199th Brigade , with the 9th Manchester Regiment , 5th Connaught Rangers and 18th King 's ( Liverpool Regiment ) . The divisional pioneers were the 9th Gloucestershire Regiment . Less than a year and a half after arriving in France , the division retained only the 6th Lancashire and 9th Manchester of its twelve original battalions and both of these had been amalgamated with other units from the 42nd Division . 
 = = = Hundred Days Offensive = = = 
 The division reached the forward areas on 27 September , under the command of XIII Corps , the reserve corps of the Fourth Army and moved into the line on 5 October , relieving the 25th Division . The division attacked at dawn on 8 October , in the opening phase of the Second Battle of Cambrai and captured the village of <unk> by nightfall against determined resistance . After this breakthrough , the division moved forward 14 miles ( 23 km ) in three days , with patrols of the Connaught Rangers entering the outskirts of Le Cateau on 10 October . On the night of 16 October , the divisional pioneers and engineers bridged the Selle and the South African Brigade crossed in thick fog to capture Le Cateau , in a costly attack . The river crossing was the opening stage of the Battle of the Selle ( 17 – 25 October ) , the final advance into Germany . 
 The division was withdrawn for a short rest , moving back into the line on 2 November . From this point onwards the 66th Division moved almost continually , in close pursuit of the retreating German army . It supported the 25th Division at the Battle of the Sambre on 4 November and on 7 November leapfrogged past the 25th Division to advance as one of the leading units of the Fourth Army . Supplies ran short and the supply services struggled to bring up sufficient food and ammunition over cratered roads and wrecked bridges and the main British advance was forced to halt . On 9 November , to maintain the pursuit , the Fourth Army improvised " Bethell 's Force " , consisting of 5th Cavalry Brigade , the South African Brigade and two RAF squadrons , along with various support units from 66th Division . It began pushing forward on 10 November and advanced several miles along a broad front , with a second advance on 11 November , only stopped at the last minute by the divisional staff , who had received warning that the armistice would begin at 11 am . 
 At the Armistice of 11 November 1918 , Bethell 's Force had reached the <unk> – Beaumont area . From 27 September to 12 November the division had incurred 2 @,@ 195 casualties , and during the Hundred Days offensive was one of only two Allied divisions to succeed in every attack . The 66th Division was ordered to move north to secure eastern Belgium . On 18 November , it began to move north into the Namur region , where it was stationed between Huy and Rochefort . The division remained there while it demobilised and was disbanded on 24 March 1919 . Bethell remained in Germany as Colonel @-@ Commandant of the 2nd Rhine Brigade , headquartered at Wiesbaden .

 = = = Background = = = 
 Throughout the 1930s tensions built between Nazi Germany and the United Kingdom as well as its allies . During late 1937 , and throughout 1938 , German demands for the annexation of Czechoslovakia 's Sudetenland led to an international crisis . In an attempt to avoid war , British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler in September and brokered the Munich Agreement . The agreement averted war and allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland . While it had been intended as an agreement to reconcile differences , and for future issues to be resolved peacefully , relations between both countries soon deteriorated . On 15 March 1939 , Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying the remnants of the Czech state . 
 In response , on 29 March , the British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore @-@ Belisha announced plans to increase the Territorial Army from 130 @,@ 000 men to 340 @,@ 000 and in so doing double the number of territorial divisions . The intended plan of action was for the existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments ( aided by an increase in pay for territorials , the removal of restrictions on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during the preceding years , the construction of better quality barracks , and an increase in supper @-@ time rations ) and then form ' Second Line ' divisions from small cadres that could be built upon . As a result , the 66th Infantry Division was to be created as a Second Line unit , a duplicate of the First Line 42nd ( East Lancashire ) Infantry Division . In April , limited conscription was introduced . At that time 34 @,@ 500 ' Militiamen ' , all of the age of 20 , were conscripted into the regular army with the intent of being trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units . However , despite the intention for the army to grow in size , the programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on the expansion and duplication process , and issues regarding the lack of facilities , equipment , and instructors . 
 = = = History = = = 
 Despite the ongoing efforts and some regiments being able to recruit the required numbers to form new battalions , the whole process had – in the words of historian James P. Levy – " not progressed beyond the paper stage when [ the Second World War ] began in September . " The 66th Infantry Division finally became active on 27 September 1939 , although its constituent units had already formed and had been administered by the 42nd ( East Lancashire ) Infantry Division . The division was headquartered in Manchester , and was again composed of the 197th , 198th , and 199th Infantry Brigades . Major @-@ General Arthur William Purser was given command , and the division was assigned to Western Command . In November , the division was transferred to Northern Command . On 10 January , Major @-@ General Alan Cunningham was given command of the division . By May , the division was based north of Manchester , spread out across parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire . 
 The war @-@ time deployment of the Territorial Army envisioned it being deployed piecemeal , to reinforce the regular army that had already been deployed to the European mainland , as equipment became available . The plan envisioned the deployment of the whole force in waves , as divisions completed their training , with the final divisions not being deployed until a year had elapsed from the outbreak of war . As a result , the division did not leave the United Kingdom as the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from France during May and June of 1940 . 
 As soon as the troops returned from France , the British Army began implementing lessons learned from the campaign and re @-@ organizing formations . As part of this , the army 's five motor divisions ( made up of two brigades ) were to be reformed as regular infantry divisions ( made up of three brigades ) . As a result , the 66th Infantry Division was disbanded on 23 June .

 Hot Fuzz is a 2007 British satirical action comedy film directed by Edgar Wright , written by Wright and Simon Pegg , and starring Pegg and Nick Frost . The three and the film 's producer Nira Park had previously worked together on the television series Spaced and the 2004 film Shaun of the Dead . The film follows two police officers attempting to solve a series of mysterious deaths in Sandford , a fictional small English village . 
 Over a hundred action films were used as inspiration for developing the script . Filming took place over eleven weeks in early 2006 , and featured an extensive cast along with various uncredited cameos . Visual effects were developed by ten artists to expand on or add explosions , gore , and gunfire scenes . 
 Debuting on 14 February 2007 in the United Kingdom and 20 April in the United States , Hot Fuzz received critical and commercial success . Shortly after the film 's release , two different soundtracks were released in the UK and US . 
 The film is the second in Wright and Pegg 's Three <unk> Cornetto trilogy and was preceded by 2004 's Shaun of the Dead and followed by 2013 's The World 's End , each of them featuring a different flavour of Cornetto ice cream . It is also the most financially successful film in the trilogy . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Police Constable Nicholas Angel , a high @-@ achieving member of the Metropolitan Police Service , is promoted to Sergeant . He is then transferred to the village of Sandford , Gloucestershire , for making his colleagues look bad by comparison . 
 The village is generally devoid of any crime , with its local Neighbourhood Watch Alliance ( NWA ) helping to keep the peace . To Angel 's frustration , the local police service is lazy and complacent . He meets police officer Danny Butterman , the son of town chief Inspector Frank Butterman . Danny is assigned as Angel 's new partner , and constantly discusses his love for action and buddy cop films . 
 Angel and Danny attend a rendition of " Romeo and Juliet " , with its leading roles played by Martin Blower and Eve Draper . After everyone leaves , Blower and Draper are killed by a cloaked figure . The next morning , they are found decapitated in Blower 's convertible . Angel suspects foul play , but everyone else passes it off as an accident . Angel is called to solve a neighborhood argument , discovering and confiscating a large stash of unlicensed firearms in an elderly man 's shed . 
 Danny invites Angel to a drink at the local bar , where Angel discusses how he can 't stop thinking of work . They meet Simon Skinner , the local supermarket manager , and George Merchant , who made a fortune selling kitchen goods . Danny takes Angel home and the two binge @-@ watch action movies . An unseen person causes a gas explosion that destroys Merchant 's mansion , killing him . The incident is deemed an accident and Angel is ridiculed for believing otherwise . 
 At the local fair , Tim Messenger , editor and journalist at The Sandford Citizen newspaper , approaches Angel , claiming to have information regarding Merchant , and requests to meet him alone . An unseen person pushes a church spire onto Messenger 's head , killing him . Angel declares the incident to be a murder and Inspector Butterman believes him . Angel reads through the copies of The Sandford Citizen and discovers a link between the victims . 
 Angel stops at the flower shop of Leslie Tiller , and learns that she intends to sell her shop and move to the city . As he is distracted , Tiller is murdered by a cloaked figure . Angel gives chase but fails to catch the murderer . <unk> together what he knows , he accuses Skinner of the murders . However , Skinner 's alibi is backed up by video footage . Angel considers the possibility of more than one killer being involved , but Inspector Butterman shoots down his idea . 
 As Angel returns home , he is attacked by Michael Armstrong , one of Skinner 's supermarket employees . Angel subdues Armstrong , then discovers the NWA 's meeting location . Angel confronts the NWA and tries to arrest them . They confess to the murders , their motive being that the victims are a threat to Sandford 's chances of winning " Village of the Year " . After Inspector Butterman reveals himself to be the leader , Angel flees and discovers the bodies of many victims . As Angel is cornered , Danny appears , and after faking Angel 's murder , begs him to leave Sandford for his own safety . 
 At a gas station , Angel is inspired by the movies he watched with Danny , and returns to Sandford . He arms himself with the confiscated guns and reunites with Danny . After several gunfights with the NWA members , the two rally their colleagues and besiege the supermarket , forcing Skinner to flee with Inspector Butterman . After a chase , they are both arrested . 
 Angel 's former superiors beg him to return to London , as the crime rate has risen heavily in his absence , but Angel remains in Sandford . As the police officers process the paperwork , Tom Weaver , the last NWA member , who works in the station attempts to kill Angel . Danny takes a bullet for Angel , and in the process Weaver accidentally activates a confiscated sea mine , which destroys the station but kills no one . One year later , Angel and Danny are in charge of the Sandford Police as Inspector and Sergeant , respectively .

 While writing the script , the film 's director and writer , Edgar Wright , as well as Pegg , intended to include Frost as the partner for Pegg 's character . Frost revealed that he would do the film only if he could name his character , and he chose " Danny Butterman " . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Wright wanted to write and direct a cop film because " there isn 't really any tradition of cop films in the UK ... We felt that every other country in the world had its own tradition of great cop action films and we had none . " Wright and Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script . The first draft took eight months to develop , and after watching 138 cop @-@ related films for dialogue and plot ideas and conducting over fifty interviews with police officers for research , the script was completed after another nine months . The title was based on the various two @-@ word titles of action films in the 1980s and 1990s . In one interview Wright declared that he " wanted to make a title that really had very little meaning ... like Lethal Weapon and Point Break and Executive Decision . " In the same interview , Pegg joked that many action films ' titles " seem to be generated from two hats filled with adjectives and nouns and you just , ' Okay , that 'll do . ' " 
 = = = Preparation and filming = = = 
 During the latter half of 2005 , Working Title approached several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location . Pegg commented , " We 're both [ Pegg and Wright ] from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up , so you could see high @-@ octane balls @-@ to @-@ the @-@ wall action in Frome " . Stow @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Wold was considered amongst others , but after being turned away , the company settled upon Wells in Somerset , Wright 's hometown , of which he has said " I love it but I also want to trash it " . Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city , as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford ; however , the Bishop 's Palace is identifiable in some shots ( and was itself used as the setting for some scenes ) . While shooting scenes in their uniforms , Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers @-@ by . Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College , including the driving school skid pan and athletic track . Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks . After editing , Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film . 
 = = = Homage = = = 
 Wright has said that Hot Fuzz takes elements from his final amateur film , Dead Right , which he described as both " Lethal Weapon set in Somerset " and " a Dirty Harry film in Somerset " . He uses some of the same locations in both films , including the Somerfield supermarket , where he used to work as a shelf @-@ stacker . In the scene in the Somerfield store , when Angel is confronting a chav for shoplifting , a DVD copy of Shaun of the Dead can be seen for a few frames . The title is Zombies ' Party , the Spanish and Portuguese title for the film . 
 Further homages to Shaun of the Dead are also present in the film . In one scene , Nicholas wants to chase a shoplifter by jumping over garden fences ; however , Danny is reluctant . Nicholas says , " What 's the matter , Danny ? You never taken a shortcut before ? " He smiles arrogantly before jumping over three in a row ( according to the DVD commentary , Pegg vaulted over three fences , and a stunt man did a back flip over the fourth ) . When Danny attempts it , he trips and falls through the fence . This is almost identical to a scene in Shaun of the Dead , including the fall @-@ through @-@ fence gag ( in Shaun of the Dead , however , it happens to Pegg 's character rather than Frost 's , and he falls over the fence rather than through it ) . The DVD commentary says that Frost purposely looked back at the camera after crashing through the fence , to show that he had done the stunt rather than someone else . 
 Frost 's characters ( Danny in Hot Fuzz , Ed in Shaun of the Dead ) have a liking for <unk> . Pegg and Wright have referred to Hot Fuzz as being the second film in " Three <unk> Cornetto Trilogy " with Shaun of the Dead as the first and The World 's End as the third . 
 Various scenes in Hot Fuzz feature a variety of action film DVDs such as <unk> and scenes from Point Break and Bad Boys II . Wright revealed that he had to get permission from every actor in each video clip , including stunt men , to use the clips and for the use of the DVD covers had to pay for the rights from the respective studios . The film parodies clichés used in other action movies . On the topic of perceived gun fetishes in these movies , Pegg has said , " Men can 't do that thing , which is the greatest achievement of humankind , which is to make another human , so we make metal versions of our own penises and fire more bits of metal out of the end into people 's heads ... It 's our turn to grab the gun by the hilt and fire it into your face . " Despite this , Pegg maintains that the film is not a spoof , in that " They lack the sneer that a lot of parodies have that look down on their source material . Because we 're looking up to it . " The film also includes various references to The Wicker Man , in which Edward Woodward had played a policeman tough on law and order . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 To illustrate the destruction of the mansion as a result of the gas explosion , gas mortars were placed in front of the building to create large @-@ scale fireballs . The wave of fire engulfs the camera , and to achieve that effect , gas mortars were used again but were fired upwards into a black ceiling piece that sloped up towards the camera . When the sequence was shot at a high speed , the flames appeared to surge across the ground . For one of the final scenes of the film , the Sandford police station is destroyed by an explosion . Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being blown out , while the building remained intact . The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station . 
 Similar to the work in Shaun of the Dead , blood and gore was prevalent throughout the film . Visual effects supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood : " In many ways , the more extreme you make it , the more people know it is stylised and enjoy the humour inherent in how ridiculous it is . It 's rather like the ( eventually ) limbless Black Knight in Monty Python 's Holy Grail . " The most time @-@ consuming gore sequence involved a character 's head being crushed by a section of a church . A dummy was used against a green screen and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body . Throughout the film , over seventy gunfight shots were digitally augmented ; Briscoe 's rationale for adding the additional effects was that " The town square shootout , for example , is full of extra little hits scattered throughout , so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off , all around them . It was a great demonstration of [ how ] seemingly very trivial enhancements can make a difference when combined across a sequence . " 
 = = Promotion = = 
 The first two teaser trailers were released on 16 October 2006 . Wright , Pegg , and Frost maintained several video blogs , which were released at various times throughout the production of the film . Wright and Frost held a panel at the 2006 Comic @-@ Con convention in San Diego , California to promote Hot Fuzz , which included preliminary footage and a question and answer session . The two returned to the convention again in 2007 to promote the US DVD release . Advance screenings of the film took place on 14 February 2007 in the UK and the world premiere was on 16 February 2007 . The premiere included escorts from motorcycle police officers and the use of blue carpet instead of the traditional red carpet .

The result is a bitingly satiric and hugely entertaining parody . " It also has a Metacritic score of 81 / 100 . Olly Richards of Empire praised the chemistry between Pegg and Frost , saying : " After almost a decade together , they ’ re clearly so comfortable in each other ’ s presence that they feel no need to fight for the punchline , making them terrific company for two hours " . Johnny Vaughan of The Sun already called it the " most arresting Brit @-@ com of 2007 " .

 = Nashville Sounds = 
 The Nashville Sounds are a Minor League Baseball team of the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) and the Triple @-@ A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics . They are located in Nashville , Tennessee , and are named for the city 's association with the music industry . The team plays its home games at First Tennessee Park which opened in 2015 and is partially located on the former site of the historic Sulphur Dell ballpark . The Sounds previously played at Herschel Greer Stadium from its opening in 1978 until the end of the 2014 season . 
 Established as an expansion team of the Double @-@ A Southern League in 1978 , the Sounds were replaced by a Triple @-@ A American Association team in 1985 . The Triple @-@ A Sounds carried on the history of the Double @-@ A team that preceded it . The Sounds later joined the PCL in 1998 . The team has served as a farm club for seven major league franchises . A total of 26 managers have led the club and its more than 1 @,@ 100 players . As of the completion of the 2015 season , the team has played in 5 @,@ 445 regular season games and compiled a win – loss record of 2 @,@ 794 – 2 @,@ 651 ( .513 ) . 
 The team fielded in 1980 was recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time . The 2006 team tied the record for the longest game in PCL history . Of the three nine @-@ inning perfect games in the history of the PCL , two have been pitched by members of the Sounds . In 2016 , Forbes listed the Sounds as the 19th @-@ most valuable Minor League Baseball team with a value of $ 30 @.@ 5 million . 
 The Sounds won the PCL Championship in 2005 as the Triple @-@ A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers .

 Nashville 's professional baseball history dates back to 1885 , beginning with the Nashville Americans . They were followed by the Blues , Tigers , <unk> , Centennials , and Vols . The city was without a professional baseball team for 14 years after the Double @-@ A Vols ceased operations after their 1963 season . In 1978 , the Nashville Sounds were added as an expansion team in the Double @-@ A Southern League . Fans responded well to the return of baseball to the city , evidenced by Nashville leading the Southern League in attendance in each of their seven seasons as a member of the league . 
 President and part owner Larry Schmittou , head coach of the Vanderbilt University baseball team from 1968 to 1978 , was instrumental in bringing professional baseball back to Nashville . Schmittou 's business philosophy revolved around earning profits not from ticket sales , but from the sale of souvenirs and concessions . This philosophy also involved promoting entertainment value , or fun , instead of promoting the baseball game . The franchise was later recognized for its promotion efforts when it won the Larry MacPhail Award for outstanding minor league promotions in 1978 , 1980 , and 1981 . With the help of country music star Conway Twitty , who heard about the proposed team in local newspapers , Schmittou brought in other recording artists such as Larry Gatlin and Jerry Reed , as well as other <unk> , as Sounds shareholders . 
 The club played their home games at a newly constructed facility , Herschel Greer Stadium , located south of downtown Nashville at the foot of St. Cloud Hill in Fort Negley Park . Schmittou invited fans to submit suggestions for the team 's name . Among the finalists were Stars , Notes , Hits , and Strings . > The chosen name , Sounds , is a play on the term " Nashville sound " , a subgenre of American country music that traces its roots to the area in the late @-@ 1950s . The team 's wordmark and color scheme were lifted from the Memphis Sounds of the American Basketball Association ( ABA ) , who used them for one season in 1974 before the team relocated and became the Baltimore Claws . When the ABA merged with the National Basketball Association in 1976 , some of the copyrights were allowed to lapse , and Nashville 's baseball team adopted the abandoned schemes . The color blue was added to Memphis ' red and white palette . Nashville 's original logo , which was used from 1978 into 1998 , and was initially sketched by Schmittou , reflects the city 's association with the country music industry . It depicts a mustachioed old @-@ time baseball player , nicknamed " Slugger " , swinging at a baseball with a guitar , a staple of country music , in place of a bat . Further illustrating the city 's musical ties is the typeface , with letters resembling musical notes and treble clefs , used to display the team name . A minor league ice hockey team also owned by Schmittou from 1981 to 1983 , the Nashville South Stars , used a nearly @-@ identical ( albeit hockey @-@ themed ) wordmark and logo as the Sounds , except with green and gold colors to match its affiliated National Hockey League club , the Minnesota North Stars . 
 = = = = Reds era ( 1978 – 1979 ) = = = = 
 As the Double @-@ A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds , the Sounds played their first game on April 15 , 1978 , against the Memphis Chicks at Memphis ' Tim McCarver Stadium , which they lost , 4 – 2 . Meanwhile , construction on Greer Stadium continued in order to be ready for the home opener . The team requested to open the season on the road and had to swap a series with the Chattanooga Lookouts in order to have enough time to complete the stadium . On April 26 , the Sounds played their first home game , a 12 – 4 victory , against the Savannah Braves in front of a sellout crowd of 8 @,@ 156 fans . The home opener was scheduled to take place the previous evening , but was rained out . Tractors and grading machines were still preparing the field on game day , and the electricity was turned on only five minutes before the gates opened . The sod , which arrived late , was laid the day before the scheduled opening game with the help of an estimated group of 50 fans who heard an announcement from general manager Farrell Owens on local radio stations inviting them to a " sod party " . The Sounds finished ninth out of ten teams during their inaugural campaign of 1978 under manager Chuck Goggin , but led all of minor league baseball in attendance by drawing 380 @,@ 000 fans . Additionally , Bruce <unk> was selected as the league 's Most Outstanding Pitcher . 
 Under manager George Scherger , the Sounds started the 1979 season poorly , before rallying to win 20 of 31 games in late May and June . They entered the last day of the first half of the season in first place , but lost their game to cross @-@ state rivals the Memphis Chicks and finished in second place . The Sounds and Chicks met again on the last day of the second half in a split doubleheader ; both games were won by Nashville . The two teams then faced @-@ off in a best @-@ of @-@ three series to determine the Western Division champion . The Sounds won the series two games to one before advancing to the Southern League championship series against the Columbus Astros . Nashville captured their first league title by defeating the Astros three games to one . Schmittou wanted to give each player a $ 1 @,@ 000 bonus for winning the pennant , but as that would have been against the National Association 's rules , he settled for buying them championship rings instead . Geoff Combe won the league 's Most Outstanding Pitcher Award . Also in 1979 , the team played host to the Southern League All @-@ Star Game . The contest pitted a team of the league 's all @-@ stars against the major league Atlanta Braves . The all @-@ stars defeated the Braves , five runs to two . Nashville 's Duane Walker was named the MVP . 
 Originally , the Reds allowed Nashville to use a designated hitter ( DH ) in their lineup . However , this allowance was later revoked , as the Reds were a part of the National League which did not use a DH . President Larry Schmittou issued an ultimatum : if Cincinnati would not let the Sounds use a DH in their lineups , they would not renew their contract and would look for a new major league affiliate . The Reds did not renege on their decision to prohibit the designated hitter , so the Sounds looked for a new affiliate after 1979 . Schmittou was then approached by five or six clubs looking to enter the Southern League as a Sounds affiliate . 
 = = = = Yankees era ( 1980 – 1984 ) = = = = 
 Larry Schmittou had originally been encouraged by the New York Yankees organization to establish the Sounds as a Triple @-@ A team , but he refused to go back on a previous promise to partner with the Reds at Double @-@ A. After the split with Cincinnati , the Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980 , becoming the Double @-@ A affiliate of the Yankees . Managers Stump Merrill ( 1980 – 81 ) and Johnny Oates ( 1982 ) and future major leaguers such as Steve Balboni , Don Mattingly , Buck Showalter , Otis Nixon , Willie McGee , Pat Tabler , and Dan Pasqua helped lead Nashville to first or second @-@ place divisional finishes from 1980 to 1984 . 
 The 1980 Sounds finished the first half of the season one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half games behind the Memphis Chicks . In the second half , the team finished in first place , 14 games ahead of the second @-@ place team . In the Western Division championship series , Nashville lost to Memphis , three games to one . Nine Southern League records were set during the season , the team 's pitching staff led the league in ERA and strikeouts , and Steve Balboni , the league MVP , led the league in runs , home runs , and total bases . Pitcher Andy <unk> was selected as the league 's top pitcher . The team also set a league attendance record , when a total of 575 @,@ 676 fans visited Greer Stadium . This record still stands as of the completion of the 2015 season . In 2001 , the 1980 Sounds were ranked as the sixty @-@ ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all @-@ time by baseball historians . 
 On April 16 , 1981 , the New York Yankees made a stop in Nashville to play an exhibition game against the Sounds . The 10 – 1 Yankees victory was played in front of a standing room only crowd of 17 @,@ 318 fans . Also on hand for the game were Yankees owner George Steinbrenner , coach Yogi Berra , and players Reggie Jackson , Bucky Dent , Lou Piniella , Bobby Murcer , Goose Gossage , Tommy John , and Johnny Oates . The Sounds won the second half of the season and went on to win the Western Division championship after defeating the Memphis Chicks in three straight games . The team suffered in the best @-@ of @-@ five league championship series , falling to the Orlando Twins , 3 – 1 . Jamie <unk> won the Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award . Don Mattingly and Willie McGee , who both played for the Sounds in 1981 , were later promoted to the major leagues . In 1985 , Mattingly was named the American League Most Valuable Player and McGee named the National League MVP . 
 The 1982 Sounds won the second half of the season and met the Knoxville Blue Jays in the division playoffs . After defeating the Blue Jays , 3 – 1 , the Sounds advanced to the league championship series to play against the Jacksonville Suns . Nashville defeated the Suns , three games to one , clinching the Southern League championship , giving the franchise their second league title . Brian <unk> was selected as the Southern League MVP , and Stefan Wever was the league 's Most Outstanding Pitcher . Wever was the fifth Sounds pitcher in five years to win the award . 
 The New York Yankees returned for another exhibition game against the Sounds on April 28 , 1983 . New York had a four @-@ run lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning , but a five @-@ run rally with two outs propelled the Sounds to a 5 – 4 win in front of 13 @,@ 641 fans . Among the Yankees in attendance for the game were Billy Martin , Yogi Berra , Goose Gossage , Ken Griffey , Sr. , Dave Winfield , Lou Piniella , and Willie Randolph . During the season , manager Doug Holmquist , frustrated with the team 's disappointing first half , instituted a system of fines for player infractions or poor performance on the field . The program ranged from a US $ 10 fine for a pitcher walking a batter with one on and two outs to a US $ 100 fine for missing curfew . Rebounding , Nashville won the second half pennant , earning the team a shot at the Western Division championship . The Sounds , however , lost the fifth game of the best @-@ of @-@ five series to the Birmingham Barons by a score of seven runs to five , ending their season . On June 21 , during a road trip to Orlando , Florida , teammates Scott Bradley , Mike Pagliarulo , Erik Peterson , and Buck Showalter were walking back to their hotel when Peterson was hit by an automobile . When he began to <unk> , Bradley put his fingers down Peterson 's throat to keep him from swallowing his tongue . He survived , but with a bruised leg and several lacerations to the head , and he returned to play later in the season . The Southern League All @-@ Star Game returned to Nashville in 1983 . Not only did the Sounds host the event , but they also served as the all @-@ star team 's competition . The all @-@ stars recorded the victory with a score of three runs to two . 
 The Sounds were one game shy of winning the first half pennant in 1984 . Winning the first half title is something that eluded the team during its entire seven @-@ year span at the Double @-@ A level . Nashville captured the second half title , however , for the sixth consecutive season , after defeating Knoxville in a playoff game . The two teams met again in the divisional playoffs , but Knoxville emerged the victor , ending the Sounds ' season . One important highlight of the first half of 1984 took place on May 4 , when Jim Deshaies pitched the club 's first no @-@ hitter against the Columbus Astros in the second game of a seven @-@ inning doubleheader . The 5 – 1 Sounds victory was cut short of being a perfect game following three walks and a batter being hit by a pitch , advancing the runner home for the only Astros run of the game . 
 = = = Triple @-@ A ( 1985 – present ) = = = 
 In 1983 , Sounds President Larry Schmittou noticed a 5 % drop in season ticket sales , a higher ratio of no @-@ shows from season ticket holders , and a slight decline in overall attendance . These issues with spectator turnout were accompanied by a decline in local media coverage , particularly in regard to road games . In order to boost interest in the team , Schmittou tried , unsuccessfully , to purchase a Triple @-@ A franchise late in the 1983 season . Attendance continued to drop in 1984 , as season ticket sales were down 12 % and overall attendance was down almost 20 % . 
 Schmittou and team owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to purchase the Evansville Triplets of the American Association , with plans to move the franchise from Evansville , Indiana , to Nashville for the 1985 season . In order to prove to the team 's Nashville banks , which would back the purchase , that the move was financially viable , Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple @-@ A team versus a Double @-@ A team . Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision , the banks were not impressed . As a result , the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation . Schmittou had planned to send Nashville 's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double @-@ A. However , when the City of Evansville balked at the request for stadium upgrades , the team was instead moved to Huntsville , Alabama , where it became the Huntsville Stars . The Triple @-@ A Sounds carried on the history of the Double @-@ A team that preceded it . The Triplets ' legacy was retired , and the Stars were established as an entirely @-@ new franchise . 
 = = = = Tigers era ( 1985 – 1986 ) = = = = 
 The Sounds entered the Triple @-@ A playing level in 1985 as an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers playing in the American Association . They played their first Triple @-@ A game on April 11 , a 3 – 1 win , against the Buffalo Bisons at Greer Stadium . The next day , Nashville competed in an exhibition game against their major league affiliate . The Tigers outlasted the Sounds , winning by a score of 9 – 3 in the tenth inning . Seven games into the season , manager Lee Walls came down with an illness , and Nashville outfielder Leon Roberts became the acting manager for seven games until Gordon Mackenzie was brought on to lead the club for the rest of year . On July 17 , Bryan Kelly pitched the club 's second no @-@ hitter against the Oklahoma City 89ers , in which the Sounds won , 6 – 0 . Nashville ended the season in second place in the Eastern Division , two and a half games out of first behind the eventual league champion Louisville Redbirds . 
 The 1986 team was managed by former player Leon Roberts who had temporarily lead the team the previous season . The Sounds finished third in their division with a 68 – 74 regular season record , their first losing season since the inaugural 1978 campaign . Also that season , the Sounds were enlisted to serve as the competition in the Southern League All @-@ Star Game , held in Huntsville , Alabama . The game was won by Nashville with a score of four runs to two . 
 = = = = Reds era , part II ( 1987 – 1992 ) = = = = 
 The Sounds rejoined the Cincinnati Reds farm system in 1987 , this time as their Triple @-@ A affiliate . As a result , a number of minor leaguers played in the Reds organization at two different levels with Nashville . Spending the beginning of the 1987 season around the top of the standings , the team hit a slump after losing a few key players midseason . The result was a 64 – 76 record and a last place finish . One player lost due to injuries was third baseman Chris Sabo . Sabo was promoted to Cincinnati in 1988 and was named the National League Rookie of the Year , a first for any former Sounds player . 
 The 1988 Sounds were in last @-@ place and had a losing record until making numerous management changes late in the season . During a two @-@ week period in July and August 1988 , the Sounds went through five different managers . The team started the season with Jack Lind , who left due to health problems . His position was filled on an interim basis by pitching coach Wayne Garland until former manager George Scherger , manager of the 1979 Southern League championship Sounds , was brought in . He retired after one game and was replaced by Jim Hoff , who stayed a few days before taking up a position with the Reds ' front office . Finally , former Texas Rangers manager Frank Lucchesi was hired to lead the Sounds for the rest of the season . Lucchesi managed the team 's last 39 games , leading them to a final record of 73 – 69 . They finished second in the East Division , sixteen games behind the Indianapolis Indians who went on to win the league championship . 
 Greer Stadium was home to a rare baseball occurrence on August 6 and August 7 , 1988 , when Nashville and Indianapolis exchanged no @-@ hitters on back @-@ to @-@ back nights . First , Indianapolis ' Randy Johnson and Pat <unk> combined for a no @-@ hit loss against the Sounds , a 1 – 0 Nashville win . That game was won by Nashville when Lenny Harris walked to first base , stole second base , stole third base , and then came home , scoring on a groundout . The next night , Nashville 's Jack Armstrong pitched a no @-@ hit game against the Indians , a 4 – 0 Sounds victory . This was the first time in American Association history that teams played in back @-@ to @-@ back no @-@ hit games , and was the third no @-@ hitter in Sounds franchise history . 
 After finishing in third @-@ place with a 74 – 72 record in 1989 , the Sounds returned in 1990 to experience their most successful season as a part of the American Association , when they compiled an 86 – 61 record under manager Pete Mackanin . Ending the regular season in a tie with the Buffalo Bisons , the Sounds won the Eastern Division championship in a one @-@ game playoff . The extra @-@ inning affair was ended by Chris Jones ' two @-@ run homer in the top of the eighteenth inning . The Sounds advanced to their first American Association championship series , where they lost to the Omaha Royals three games to two . Left @-@ hander Chris Hammond won the league 's Most Valuable Pitcher Award for 1990 . That year , Nashville set their all @-@ time attendance record when a total of 605 @,@ 122 fans came out to Greer Stadium . 
 In 1991 , the Sounds started the year in first @-@ place , where they remained for only ten days . By May 1 , the team had fallen into third @-@ place in the Eastern Division , where they remained for the rest of the season . Nashville posted a losing record every month during the season and finished the year 16 games behind first @-@ place Buffalo . The following year was Nashville 's last as a Reds affiliate . The team posted a 67 – 77 record in 1992 , winding up in fourth @-@ place . 
 = = = = White Sox era ( 1993 – 1997 ) = = = = 
 Nashville switched affiliations again in 1993 , this time becoming the top farm club of the Chicago White Sox . In addition to a new affiliation , the 1993 season also brought the addition of Greer Stadium 's signature guitar @-@ shaped scoreboard . In their first year with the White Sox , the Sounds clinched the East Division title with an 81 – 62 record . In the league championship series , the Iowa Cubs defeated the Sounds in extra innings in game seven . Nashville 's Rick Renick , who managed the club from 1993 to 1996 , was named the American Association Manager of the Year in his first season . 
 The Sounds shared Greer Stadium with the Southern League 's Nashville Xpress , previously known as the Charlotte Knights , during the 1993 and 1994 seasons . This came about when Charlotte acquired a Triple @-@ A expansion franchise in 1993 , leaving the city 's Double @-@ A team without a home . Sounds owner Larry Schmittou offered Greer as a temporary home ballpark for the team . In order to accommodate an additional team at Greer , the Xpress scheduled its home games during the Sounds ' road trips . Baseball America ranked the dual Nashville teams as number one on its list of the " top 10 happenings in minor league baseball . " In 1995 , the Xpress relocated to Wilmington , North Carolina , and became the Port City Roosters . 
 In 1994 , the Sounds earned an 83 – 61 record , placing them in second . They also made their second consecutive appearance in the league 's championship series . In the first round , Nashville swept the New Orleans Zephyrs in three straight games to advance to the league finals . In the best @-@ of @-@ five series , the Indianapolis Indians defeated the Sounds three games to one . Nashville hosted the midseason Triple @-@ A All @-@ Star Game in 1994 . Sounds players Ray Durham , Drew Denson , and Scott Ruffcorn were selected for the event , however Ruffcorn was later placed on the disabled list and replaced by Steve Schrenk . Durham won the " Stars of Stars " award , recognizing him as the most valuable All @-@ Star representing the American Association . Ruffcorn won the association 's Most Valuable Pitcher Award for 1994 . 
 The Sounds compiled a 68 – 76 record , 20 games out of first @-@ place , in 1995 . Originally , Michael Jordan , who played with the White Sox 's Double @-@ A Birmingham Barons in 1994 , was signed to play the 1995 season as a non @-@ drafted free agent for the Sounds . However , with the ongoing MLB strike , Jordan decided to quit the sport rather than becoming a replacement player and being labeled a strikebreaker . 
 The team improved their record in 1996 , ending up with 77 wins and 67 losses . Despite a decent winning percentage , Nashville failed to secure a spot in the playoffs . Outfielder Jeff Abbott won the Rookie of the Year Award , and Rick Renick earned his second Manager of the Year Award . This season marked the last that Larry Schmittou was the team 's principal owner . With the city prepared to welcome a National Football League franchise , the Tennessee Titans , Schmittou felt that revenue would be drawn away from his baseball team . He sold his entire financial interest in the Sounds to Al Gordon , president of <unk> Companies LLC . The following year , Nashville put together a 74 – 68 campaign , again failing to win either half of the season , excluding them from the postseason . In addition to being selected for both the midseason and postseason All @-@ Star teams , outfielder Magglio Ordóñez garnered the league 's Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year Awards . 
 = = = = Pirates era ( 1998 – 2004 ) = = = = 
 Following the 1997 season , the American Association , of which the Sounds were a member , disbanded , and its teams were absorbed by the two remaining Triple @-@ A leagues — the International League and Pacific Coast League . Nashville joined the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) . The franchise also picked up a new major league affiliation , becoming the top farm club of the Pittsburgh Pirates . For the first time since the team 's foundation in 1978 , the Sounds adopted a new logo , color scheme , and uniforms that were introduced over the course of the 1998 and 1999 seasons . The original red , white , and blue colors were replaced by black and red . The new team logo , replacing the original " Slugger " , consisted of a black and red music note enclosed in a circle of the same colors bearing the team name . 
 In 1998 , the team 's first season as a Pirates affiliate , the Sounds finished last in the division with a 67 – 76 record . The Sounds were led by manager Trent Jewett who would go on to win 320 games from 1998 to 2000 and 2003 to 2004 , placing him first on the all @-@ time wins list for Sounds managers . Improving from the previous year , the 1999 team put together an 80 – 60 record , but their second @-@ place finish left them out of the postseason picture . 
 Nashville finished the 2000 season with a 63 – 79 record , resulting in a last @-@ place finish in the divisional standings . Former All @-@ Star Sounds infielder Marty Brown returned to the club to serve as its 25th manager in 2001 , becoming the third former Nashville player to serve as the team 's skipper . The Sounds compiled a 64 – 77 record , leaving them in third @-@ place . On June 30 , <unk> Redman became the first Sounds player to hit for the cycle . Redman also holds the Sounds franchise record for the most triples ( 30 ) during his career with the team . The season resulted in a third @-@ place divisional finish with a 72 – 71 record in 2002 . Chad Hermansen , who played for the Sounds from 1998 to 2002 , holds three career franchise records : runs ( 303 ) , home runs ( 92 ) , and runs batted in ( 286 ) . 
 On April 7 , 2003 , right @-@ hander John Wasdin pitched the first perfect game in Nashville Sounds history in his first start of the season against the Albuquerque Isotopes . The 4 – 0 Sounds win was only the second nine @-@ inning perfect game in PCL history . That year , Trent Jewett led the Sounds to an 81 – 62 record . The team clinched the Eastern Division title , giving them their first postseason berth as a member of the Pacific Coast League and first postseason appearance since 1994 . Nashville met Albuquerque in the American Conference championship series , defeating the Isotopes three games to one . The Sounds then lost the best @-@ of @-@ five league championship series in three straight games to the Sacramento River Cats . 
 On May 21 , 2004 , catcher J. R. House became the second Sounds player to hit for the cycle . The team completed the 2004 campaign with a 63 – 79 record , finishing last in the division . Early in the season , Jason Bay played four games in Nashville before being promoted to Pittsburgh . Following the major league season , he was named the National League Rookie of the Year . This made him the second former player from Nashville to receive such honors . 
 = = = = Brewers era ( 2005 – 2014 ) = = = = 
 The Sounds changed affiliates in 2005 , welcoming the Milwaukee Brewers as their sixth different major league franchise . Coincidentally , the major / minor league sports connection between Nashville and Milwaukee was duplicated from 2005 to 2014 , but with reverse roles , in ice hockey , as the Milwaukee Admirals were the top @-@ level minor league affiliate of the National Hockey League 's Nashville Predators . The Sounds also debuted a new oval @-@ shaped logo with a baseball player silhouetted against a yellow background hitting a ball toward the Nashville skyline with the city 's name written above and the team name written in script below . The new Brewers affiliate was managed by Frank Kremblas and featured top prospects such as Rickie Weeks , Prince Fielder , Nelson Cruz , and Corey Hart . The Sounds ' new affiliation started well as the club won the American North Division title on the second @-@ to @-@ last day of the season with a 75 – 69 record . The team went on to win the American Conference championship against the Oklahoma RedHawks , three games to two , before sweeping the Tacoma Rainiers in three straight games in the finals to win the 2005 Pacific Coast League championship . This was Nashville 's first title since their previous league crown in 1982 and their first Triple @-@ A title . 
 On July 15 , 2006 , Nashville pitchers Carlos Villanueva , Mike Meyers , and Alec Zumwalt combined to pitch the fifth no @-@ hitter in team history , a 2 – 0 win over the Memphis Redbirds . On May 5 – 6 , the Sounds participated in a 24 @-@ inning game against the New Orleans Zephyrs . The contest , played over the course of two days , lasted a total of eight hours and seven minutes . This game matched the longest game , in terms of innings played , in PCL history . Additionally , several team and league records were broken by both clubs . The record was originally set on June 8 , 1909 in a game between the San Francisco Seals and Oakland Oaks . A few years later , on September 10 , 1911 , the record was tied by a contest between the Sacramento Solons and Portland Beavers . The Sounds finished the season with a 76 – 68 record , tied with the Iowa Cubs for first place in the American North Division . Nashville won the division title and advanced to the postseason by means of a tiebreaker ( winning the regular season series versus Iowa nine games to seven ) . In the conference championship series , Nashville lost to the Round Rock Express , three games to two . 
 The 2007 Sounds featured top Brewers prospects Yovani Gallardo and Ryan Braun . Braun , who made his major league debut on May 25 , was named National League Rookie of the Year following the season , making him the third former Sounds player to receive this honor . On June 25 , Manny Parra pitched the club 's second perfect game , only the third nine @-@ inning perfect game in PCL history , against the Round Rock Express . The team , led by PCL Manager of the Year Frank Kremblas , captured the American North Division title for the third straight year and finished the season with a league best .618 winning percentage ( 89 – 55 ) . In the conference championship series , they were defeated by the New Orleans Zephyrs , three games to one . <unk> pitcher R.A. Dickey won the Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Year Award . 
 On June 14 , 2008 , following massive flooding in the Midwest , the Sounds and the Iowa Cubs played a game with an official attendance of zero . Though downtown Des Moines was under a mandatory evacuation , team officials received permission from the city to play the game as long as no fans were allowed into Principal Park . In order to keep fans away , the lights and scoreboard were not turned on , the game was not broadcast in the local market , and a message on the team 's website announced that the game was postponed . PCL Commissioner Branch Rickey III believed that this was the first time such actions were taken out of necessity . The Sounds were further affected by weather when Hurricane Gustav forced the cancellation of the last three games of their season against the New Orleans Zephyrs . The team 's 59 – 81 record ( .421 ) is the second @-@ lowest in the team 's history . 
 On October 30 , 2008 , <unk> Companies LLC entered into an agreement to sell the Sounds to MFP Baseball , a New York @-@ based group of investors consisting of Masahiro <unk> , Steve Posner , and Frank Ward . Keeping the team in Nashville was one of the PCL 's top criteria for approval of the sale . The transaction received final approval from Major League Baseball and the PCL on February 26 , 2009 . MFP made significant renovations to Greer Stadium while it continued to explore building a new downtown ballpark for the club . 
 Rebounding from their 2008 campaign , the 2009 Sounds achieved a 75 – 69 record under new manager Don Money . Despite a winning record and spending the majority of the season in first place , the Sounds finished the season two games behind their cross @-@ state rivals , and eventual league champions , the Memphis Redbirds . The 2010 season proved to be reminiscent of the previous campaign . Though Nashville finished the year with a winning 77 – 67 record , it was only good enough to place fourth ( last ) in the division . 
 Sounds right fielder Caleb <unk> became the third player in team history to hit for the cycle when he accomplished the feat on July 10 , 2011 . Center fielder Logan Schafer garnered national media attention when he initiated a triple play on August 20 , 2011 , against the Omaha Storm Chasers . What made the rare occurrence even more unusual is that the ball first bounced off Schafer 's glove and head before landing in his glove for the first out . He then returned the ball to the infield where second baseman Eric Farris and first baseman Mat Gamel completed the triple play by stepping on their respective bases . Nashville ended the year with a 71 – 73 record , placing third in the American North Division . 
 Managed by Mike Guerrero , the Sounds finished the 2012 season in second place with a losing 67 – 77 record , sixteen games behind first @-@ place Omaha . Nashville set a franchise record low win – loss record in 2013 . The 57 – 87 season eclipsed the previous franchise record ( 59 – 81 ) set in 2008 . Despite this performance , pitcher Johnny Hellweg won the PCL Pitcher of the Year Award , and Guerrero was selected for the Mike Coolbaugh Award in recognition for his contributions to the game . 
 Prior to the 2014 season , the Sounds , Metro Nashville , and the State of Tennessee entered into an agreement to build a new ballpark to replace Greer Stadium at the beginning of the 2015 season . On August 27 , 2014 , the Sounds hosted the final game at Greer Stadium , an 8 – 5 loss to the Sacramento River Cats . In his only plate appearance , Nashville catcher Lucas May struck out swinging with a full count and the bases loaded to end the game . The announced attendance at the game was a standing @-@ room @-@ only crowd of 11 @,@ 067 , the first sellout since 2010 , and the largest crowd since 2007 . The team , led by veteran minor league manager Rick Sweet , finished the season with a 76 – 67 record , in second place , two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half games behind the Memphis Redbirds . Jimmy Nelson , the Brewers ' top prospect at the start of the season , was elected PCL Pitcher of the Year ; he received all but one of the votes . 
 = = = = Athletics era ( 2015 – present ) = = = = 
 Nashville entered into a four @-@ year player development contract , a working agreement between a major and minor league baseball team , with the Oakland Athletics that runs from 2015 through 2018 . The Sounds also adopted a new color scheme , set of logos , and uniforms before the season . The team hired sports design firm <unk> to create their new visual identity . At one point , the firm was asked to explore new team names which included " <unk> " , " Hits " , " <unk> " , " Picks " , " <unk> " , and " Roosters . " Nashville chose to stick with the Sounds moniker , but elected to embrace a new color scheme that originally included Broadway Burnt Orange , Sunburst Tan , Neon Orange , and Cash Black . However , the team returned to the previous red and black color scheme with the addition of platinum silver as an accent color before the start of the season following mixed feedback from team fans . The new logos incorporated elements that reflect Nashville 's " Music City " moniker , such as guitars , guitar picks , and a guitar 's sound hole , as well as neon signs such as those in the city 's Broadway entertainment district . 
 The start of the 2015 season marked the first time that the Sounds played at the new downtown First Tennessee Park . The Sounds defeated the Colorado Springs Sky Sox , 3 – 2 in 10 innings , in the inaugural home opener in front of an announced paid attendance of 10 @,@ 459 . Prior to the game , Mayor Karl Dean threw out the ceremonial first pitch . " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " was performed by Charles Esten ( a star of the television series Nashville ) , who also sang at the park 's ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony earlier in the day . Under manager Steve <unk> , Nashville finished their first season as an A 's affiliate in third place with a 66 – 78 record . 
 Barry Zito , who won the American League Cy Young Award in 2002 , made his return to professional baseball with the Sounds in 2015 after sitting out the 2014 season . Zito was lauded by his Nashville teammates for embracing the Triple @-@ A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team : charting pitches between starts , coaching first base , and even buying dinner for the entire team on his birthday . 
 The Sounds added the Country Legends Race , similar to major league mascot races , such as the Sausage Race and Presidents Race , to its between @-@ innings entertainment in 2016 . In the middle of the fifth inning , people in oversized foam caricature costumes depicting country musicians Johnny Cash , George Jones , and Reba McEntire race around the warning track from center field , through the visiting bullpen , and to the home plate side of the first base dugout .

 = = Rivals = = 
 Nashville 's chief rivals have been those based in Memphis , Tennessee . Located approximately 200 miles ( 320 km ) to the south west and connected to Nashville by Interstate 40 , Memphis has fielded several teams which have competed in the same leagues as Nashville 's teams since the late 19th century . The Sounds entered the rivalry when they joined the Southern League in 1978 . Nashville played in the West Division against the Memphis Chicks . In 1979 , the Chicks won the first half of the division and the Sounds won the second half . In the best @-@ of @-@ three division finals , the Sounds defeated the Chicks in two out of three games before going on to win the Southern League Championship . Memphis and Nashville each won the first and second halves , respectively , of the 1980 season . This time , however , Memphis won the Western Division title , defeating Nashville in three out of four games . The teams met again under the same circumstances in 1981 . The Sounds swept the Chicks in three straight games to win the Western Division finals . 
 The interstate rivalry was interrupted when Nashville moved to the American Association in 1985 , but was renewed when the Sounds joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998 . The Sounds and the Memphis Redbirds were division rivals in the American Conference East Division from 1998 to 2004 , the American Conference North Division from 2005 to 2013 , and the American Conference Southern Division since 2014 . In 2009 , Memphis clinched the American Conference North Division title , finishing the season just two games ahead of Nashville which spent the majority of the season in first place . Similarly , Nashville finished the 2014 season two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half games behind Memphis after having led the division for most of the season . 
 From 2012 to 2015 , the two teams competed in the I @-@ 40 Cup Series , a season @-@ long , 16 @-@ game series between the clubs . Whichever of the two won the most games played between them was declared the winner and received a trophy cup to keep until the next season . The losing team donated game tickets to a charity selected by the winner . The Sounds won the inaugural 2012 contest ( 9 – 7 ) , and Memphis won the 2013 series ( 7 – 9 ) . The teams tied the 2014 and 2015 series ( both 8 – 8 ) ; the Redbirds retained the title in both instances . The teams discontinued the trophy cup , friendly wager , and promotional references to the Series after 2015 . 
 As of the completion of the 2015 series , Memphis leads the all @-@ time series against Nashville with a record of 897 – 872 ( <unk> ) . This record encompasses all 91 years of competition in the original Southern League , Southern Association , Southern League , and Pacific Coast League . Nashville , however , leads the all @-@ time 18 @-@ year PCL series with a record of 154 – 132 ( .538 ) .

 = = = Herschel Greer Stadium ( 1978 – 2014 ) = = = 
 The Sounds originally played at Herschel Greer Stadium from 1978 through 2014 . The ballpark , which still stands , is located on the grounds of Fort Negley , an American Civil War fortification approximately two miles ( 3 km ) south of downtown Nashville . The venue experienced numerous expansions and contractions after its completion in 1978 , but seated 10 @,@ 300 spectators during its final 2014 season . Its best known feature is the giant 115 @.@ 6 foot ( 35 @.@ 2 m ) guitar @-@ shaped scoreboard behind the left field wall . 
 Following the construction of newer , relatively luxurious minor league ballparks , Greer Stadium had fallen below the standards set for Triple @-@ A stadiums by professional baseball in 1990 . At the time , owner Larry Schmittou tried to convince the city to approve a new ballpark , but was unsuccessful . Throughout the 2000s , the team continued in its attempts to gather approval and financing for a new ballpark to replace Greer . At one point , a new stadium , First Tennessee Field , was planned for construction on the west bank of the Cumberland River in downtown . Disagreements over who would pay for the ballpark repeatedly pushed back opening day at the field , and eventually resulted in the cancellation of the project altogether . In the meantime , numerous upgrades and repairs , including over $ 3 @.@ 5 million worth of improvements from 2008 to 2009 , were made to Greer in order to preserve its functionality until a new stadium could be built . A deal for such a new ballpark was achieved in late 2013 . The Sounds played their final game at Greer on August 27 , 2014 . 
 = = = First Tennessee Park ( 2015 – present ) = = = 
 The Sounds ' current home ballpark is First Tennessee Park , which opened on April 17 , 2015 . It is located in downtown Nashville at the location of the former Sulphur Dell ballpark . Construction on the $ 47 million stadium began with a ceremonial groundbreaking on January 27 , 2014 . The stadium has a fixed seating capacity of 8 @,@ 500 people , but can accommodate up to 10 @,@ 000 people with additional berm seating . The stadium features wide concourses with direct views of the playing field . Its design , which incorporates the use of musical and baseball imagery , is meant to connect the park with the city 's entertainment and sports heritage . 
 Like Greer Stadium before it , one of First Tennessee Park 's most recognizable features is a 142 by 55 foot ( 43 by 17 m ) guitar @-@ shaped scoreboard beyond the right @-@ center field wall . Unlike Greer 's guitar , which was only able to display basic in @-@ game information such as the line score , count , and brief player statistics , the new , larger version is also capable of displaying colorful graphics and animations , the batting order , fielding positions , expanded statistics , and player photographs . 
 = = Uniforms = = 
 Nashville 's current uniforms , which were adopted in 2015 , use a similar color scheme to that which was used from 1998 through 2014 . The palette consists of red , black , and platinum silver . Additionally , new uniforms and logos incorporate elements that reflect Nashville 's " Music City " moniker . Home uniforms consist of white jerseys with single lines of red piping around the sleeve openings and up the front going around the neck . The word " Sounds " is sewn on the chest in red letters surrounded by platinum silver and black which resemble the sound holes on a guitar . A patch of a red , silver , black , and white guitar shown hitting a baseball is located on the left sleeve . An Oakland Athletics elephant logo is sewn on the right sleeve . The player 's last name is sewn on the back in black block characters , and his number is displayed below his name in red sound @-@ hole lettering with a silver border and black drop shadow . White pants with a single line of red piping going up the sides are worn with black belts and black socks . The home cap is solid black with the primary " N " guitar pick logo . Batting helmets are glossy black with the same " N " pick logo . 
 Road uniforms are identical to those worn for home games with only a few exceptions : jerseys and pants are made from gray material , " Nashville " is written across the chest instead of " Sounds " , pants have no pinstripes , and the cap bears a guitar pick logo with an " S " in place of an " N " . The team wears an alternate jersey for all Friday games and occasionally on the road . These black mesh jerseys are similar to the home and road versions , but with " Music City " written across the chest , no names on the back , and " Nashville " sewn in red letters under the Athletics sleeve logo . They are usually worn with a cap with the letters " MC " , for " Music City " , over a guitar pick . The batting practice cap is solid red with the guitar patch on the front . 
 A second set of alternate uniforms honoring the 1978 Sounds are worn for Thursday home games in conjunction with Throwback Thursday promotions . The jerseys , similar to those worn by the 1978 team , are white pullover v @-@ necks with bands of red , white , and blue around the neck , with larger bands at the sleeve openings . The word " Sounds " is written across the chest in red @-@ on @-@ blue music note @-@ like script , with the player 's number below the team name on the player 's left chest in blue block characters surrounded by red . The right sleeve bears a " Slugger " patch . White pants are worn with blue belts and blue stirrups . The cap is blue with a red brim , displaying an " N " styled like a music note in white , bordered by red . The team wears camouflage jerseys paired with the home pants and home caps for all Sunday home games as a part of Military Sundays . The jerseys feature a desert camouflage pattern incorporating brown , sand , and light tan . With the addition of an American flag on the left sleeve , the same " Sounds " wordmark , front numbers , and back numbers as appear on home uniforms are printed on these jerseys .

 The team has utilized two color palettes prior to its current color scheme . The original colors , used from 1978 to 1998 , consisted of red , white , and blue . From 1998 to 2014 , the Sounds used a black and red palette similar to the club 's current colors . Both color schemes were used in the 1998 season during the transition from one to the other . 
 From 1978 to 1986 , the team wore pullover v @-@ neck jerseys made of white fabric , for home games , gray , for road games , and red or blue , for use as alternates . Bands of red , white , and blue were worn around the neck , with larger bands at the sleeve openings ( the blue jerseys had one white band and two red bands ) . The word " Sounds " was written across the chest in red @-@ on @-@ blue music note @-@ like script . Numbers , but not names , were sewn on the back of jerseys . The team 's pants were white and also displayed small red , white , and blue stripes down the legs and larger stripes around the waistband . Similar gray pants were worn for road games . Beginning in 1984 , numbers were also located on the front of jerseys on the player 's left chest , below the team name . The team wore a blue cap with a red brim , displaying an " N " styled like a music note in white , bordered by red ; this was the official team cap from 1978 through the mid @-@ 1990s . 
 From 1987 to 1998 , the team wore button up jerseys made of white fabric , for home games , and gray , for road games . The design of the home jerseys remained the same as their previous uniforms . The word " Sounds " was still written across the chest in blue music note @-@ like script , with a red border ; though , the font was changed briefly from 1987 to 1988 . Numbers were present on the front of jerseys below the team name on the player 's left chest in blue block characters surrounded by red . The back of the jersey carried the player 's number ; during some years , names were also present . Road grays had " Nashville " written across the chest and were missing the tri @-@ color bands at both the neck and sleeves . During this time , the team also added a blue mesh v @-@ neck jersey with the red and white guitar swinger logo on the left chest . The wide tri @-@ color stripes were dropped from the pants and were replaced by a blue belt . The Sounds continued to wear the original red @-@ billed blue cap with all uniforms until approximately 1993 when a new cap was introduced . The new all @-@ blue cap added the guitar @-@ swinger logo to accompany the " N. " The two caps were worn interchangeably through 1998 . 
 The team switched to a red and black color scheme over the course of the 1998 and 1999 seasons . In the latter season , uniforms consisted of pinstriped pants and jerseys , with black sleeves bearing a music note logo on the left sleeve . There was also an alternate jersey made of red fabric with black and gray trim around the sleeve opening and a music note logo on the left chest . Another alternate , made of black material , had red and white trim at the sleeve openings and a similar music note logo on the left chest . 
 In 2003 , the team switched to solid white pants and jerseys for home games . These jerseys had " Sounds " written across the chest in red script surrounded by black , had red and black piping around sleeve openings , around the neck , and along the row of buttons going up the chest , a music note logo on the left sleeve , and numbers on the front of jerseys below the team name . Pants had the same piping going down the legs on the outside . From 2006 to 2012 , similar jerseys without sleeves or player 's number on the front were worn . Players wore these vest @-@ like jerseys over black T @-@ shirts of varying sleeve lengths . Player 's names were written on the back in black block characters ; numbers were also displayed in large red characters surrounded by black . Road jerseys initially bared " Sounds " across the chest , but were later changed to " Nashville " ; these usually lacked the player 's name on the back . A Milwaukee Brewers logo was added to the front left shoulder in 2007 . The official home and road caps were black with a red and white music note logo on the front . 
 From 2013 to 2014 , team jerseys were made of mesh @-@ like material with black underarm sections at the armpits and a single line of black piping going down the sleeves and across the shoulders to the neck . A Brewers logo was sewn on the left sleeve . On home jerseys , the word " Sounds " was written across the chest in red script surrounded by black . The player 's name was displayed on the back in black block characters ; numbers were also shown in large red characters surrounded by black . Road jerseys were the same , but with " Nashville " across the chest , red underarm sections and sleeve piping in place of black , and no name on the back . The team 's alternate uniforms from 2010 to 2014 were similar to these jerseys , except they were made of red material with black underarm sections and sleeve piping . " Sounds " was written across the chest in white script surrounded by black . A Brewers logo was located on the front of the left shoulder . Numbers , in white surrounded by black , were sewn on the back in block characters .

 During the opening season of 1978 , Nashville Sounds games were broadcast on <unk> 96 @.@ 3 FM by announcer and station owner , Monte Hale . He died following the inaugural season , after which Bob Jamison was hired for the 1979 season . Nashville @-@ native and future sports talk show host George Plaster served as a color commentator from 1980 to 1981 and 1985 to 1986 . Jamison remained the voice of the Sounds through 1990 when he was hired as the radio broadcaster for the California Angels . For the 1991 season , the Sounds hired former Huntsville Stars and Iowa Cubs broadcaster Steve Carroll . After 1995 , Carroll left to become the radio voice of the NHL 's Philadelphia Flyers and , later , the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim . 
 Steve Selby served as the lead broadcaster for the Sounds from 1996 to 1999 . Chuck <unk> , a former assistant broadcaster , was promoted to the role of lead broadcaster at the beginning of 2000 . Stu Paul was the Sounds ' play @-@ by @-@ play broadcaster for the 2010 and 2011 seasons . Since 2012 , Jeff Hem has been the team 's lead broadcaster . All Sounds home and road games are broadcast on <unk> 102 @.@ 5 FM or its sister station , <unk> 94 @.@ 9 FM . Live audio broadcasts are also available online through the team 's website . 
 Games can be viewed through the <unk> subscription feature of the official website of Minor League Baseball , with audio provided by a radio simulcast . Sounds home games were regularly televised by <unk> from 1982 to 1992 . A few games were also aired by <unk> in 1999 . From 2005 to 2008 , a monthly television program , called Sounds On Demand , aired throughout Middle Tennessee via Comcast cable , and was also available " On Demand " through Comcast Digital Cable programming . The 30 @-@ minute show , hosted by Chuck <unk> , featured player interviews , team news , tips from players on how to play the game , and other related content . 
 = = Mascots = = 
 The Nashville Sounds ' mascot is an anthropomorphic rooster named Booster . He is bright red with yellow legs , beak , comb , and palms and yellow and orange tail feathers resembling flames . He wears the same style jerseys as the team with the number zero on the back . He made his debut on April 17 , 2015 , at the Sounds ' first game at First Tennessee Park . The name refers to " boosting " or building enthusiasm for the team , while the costume is a play on Nashville hot chicken . 
 The first Sounds mascot was introduced during the team 's inaugural 1978 season . Homer <unk> , whose name was selected in a naming contest , resembled their major league affiliate 's mascot — Mr. Red of the Cincinnati Reds . The character was human in appearance , with the exception of an oversized anthropomorphized baseball in place of a human head . The mustachioed mascot donned a uniform identical to that of Sounds players . 
 From 1995 to 1996 , a lime @-@ green dinosaur named Champ was the team 's mascot . Following altercations with team management and league personnel during games , Champ , vis @-@ à @-@ vis his performer , did not return for the 1997 season . 
 An anthropomorphic cougar named Ozzie was the team 's mascot from 1997 to 2014 . The original Ozzie came from the Class A Kane County Cougars minor league team , which had an extra mascot uniform . The surplus cougar outfit was sent to Nashville , and , after building a fan following during Ozzie 's first season , team management decided to make him the permanent mascot . In 1997 , the Ozzie costume was identical to the brown cougar costume which is still in use by Kane County . In 1998 , a new yellow costume was introduced . Ozzie wore the same style of uniform as the team , but with no hat . Ozzie was retired when the Sounds left Greer Stadium in 2014 , although he continued to make appearances during the 2014 to 2015 off @-@ season . 
 = = Faith Nights = = 
 In addition to promotions that are synonymous with minor league baseball like giveaways , theme nights , fireworks nights , and discounted ticket or concessions nights , the Nashville Sounds also host what are called Faith Nights . In 2002 , the Sounds became the first sports team to host Faith Night promotions . These Christian @-@ based promotional evenings include pre @-@ game concerts from Christian music artists , Bible @-@ themed bobblehead giveaways , and testimonials from players about their faith . Artists who performed at Nashville 's Greer Stadium include Jars of Clay , Hawk Nelson , and Matthew West . Chris August , Plumb , and Citizen Way have performed at First Tennessee Park . Brent High , then Vice President of Sales for the Sounds , and Mike Snider , the president and owner of Third Coast Sports , an entertainment and sports marketing firm in Nashville , are credited with developing the promotion . 
 Since their inception , Faith Nights have been among the top @-@ ten most @-@ attended games each season . During Faith Nights in 2004 , the Sounds experienced a 93 % increase in attendance over their average season attendance for non @-@ Faith Night dates ; over 500 church groups attended these games . That fall , the team partnered with the Nashville Area Habitat for Humanity to build a home for a family in need . The team raised more than $ 45 @,@ 000 from donations and 10 % of ticket proceeds on Faith Nights . 
 The promotion has since been adopted by at least 40 other minor league teams . It has also been used by major league teams such as the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals . Teams from the National Football League and National Basketball Association have also shown interest in holding Faith Night promotions . The program has garnered national media attention for the Sounds from The New York Times and National Public Radio .

 = Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 9 = 
 The Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 9 ( Russian : Микоян и Гуревич МиГ @-@ 9 , USAF / DOD designation Type 1 , NATO reporting name : Fargo ) was the first turbojet fighter developed by Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich in the years immediately after World War II . It used reverse @-@ engineered German BMW 003 engines . Categorized as a first generation jet fighter , it was moderately successful , but suffered from persistent problems with engine flameouts when firing its guns at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion . A number of different armament configurations were tested , but nothing solved the problem . Several different engines were evaluated , but none were flown as the prototype of the MiG @-@ 15 promised superior performance . 
 A total of 610 aircraft were built , including prototypes , and they entered service in 1948 with the Soviet Air Forces . At least 372 were transferred to the People 's Liberation Army Air Force in 1950 to defend Chinese cities against air raids by the Nationalist Chinese and train the Chinese pilots in jet operations . The MiG @-@ 9 was quickly replaced by the MiG @-@ 15 , and three are known to survive . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 In February 1945 , the Council of People 's Commissars ordered the Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich ( MiG ) OKB to develop a single @-@ seat jet fighter to be equipped with two German BMW 003 engines . Intended to destroy bombers , the aircraft was to be equipped with a single 57 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) or 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) gun , plus two 23 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 9 in ) guns . A more detailed directive was issued on 9 April setting out requirements that the aircraft should have a maximum speed of 900 kilometers per hour ( 559 mph ) at sea level and a speed of 910 km / h ( 565 mph ) at an altitude of 5 @,@ 000 meters ( 16 @,@ 400 ft ) . It should be able to climb to that altitude in four minutes or less and it should have a maximum range of 820 kilometers ( 510 mi ) . Three prototypes were ordered to be ready for flight tests by 15 March 1946 . 
 The OKB chose a " pod @-@ and @-@ boom " layout for their new fighter , the I @-@ 300 ( also called the izdeliye F ( model or product F ) by the OKB ) because it offered the advantages of improved landing performance and better visibility from the cockpit when landing , but it had some drawbacks like the unfamiliar tricycle arrangement of the landing gear , protecting the rear fuselage from the jet exhaust , and where to place the aircraft 's armament . The all @-@ metal aircraft had unswept , mid @-@ mounted wings with two prominent air intakes in the nose . Its two @-@ spar wings were fitted with slotted flaps and Frise ailerons . Its powerplant comprised two RD @-@ 20 turbojets , which were Soviet @-@ manufactured versions of the BMW 003 . The two engines were located behind the cockpit in the lower fuselage , with the exhaust exiting under the tail unit . A steel laminate heatshield was installed on the bottom of the rear fuselage to protect it from the exhaust gasses . There were four bag @-@ type fuel tanks in the fuselage and three in each wing , providing a total internal fuel capacity of 1 @,@ 625 liters ( 429 US gallons ) . The cockpit was not pressurized . The planned armament consisted of a 57 mm NL @-@ 57 cannon mounted in the centerline engine intake bulkhead and two 23 mm Nudelman @-@ Suranov NS @-@ 23 autocannon mounted on the lower lip of the air intakes . The N @-@ 57 gun was provided with 28 rounds and the two NS @-@ 23 cannon had 80 rounds each . 
 Construction of the three prototypes began in late 1945 and the first prototype began manufacturer 's testing on 30 December . The ground testing revealed that the engine exhaust caused a low @-@ pressure area under the rear fuselage which caused the fighter to tilt tail @-@ down during engine tests . The rigidly mounted heatshield caused the underside of the rear fuselage to deform because the steel and the duralumin skin of the fuselage had different expansion ratios when heated . The rear fuselage and the heatshield were both redesigned to eliminate these problems . On 23 March the prototype was trucked to the Flight Research Institute ( LII ) ' s airfield at Ramenskoye to begin preparations for flight testing . 
 According to aviation historian Bill Gunston , on 24 April 1946 representatives from Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin to determine which aircraft would be the first Soviet jet to fly . ( MiG had brought the I @-@ 300 , and Yakovlev the <unk> ( 3 ) -15 . ) MiG won and the I @-@ 300 's first flight lasted six minutes . These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield . It was stiffened before the twelfth flight , but that only partially cured the problem . The first aircraft crashed , killing the pilot , during a demonstration in front of high @-@ ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and they hit the horizontal stabilizers . The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month , but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December . Meanwhile , the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight , but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely . Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced . 
 The aircraft was given the service designation of MiG @-@ 9 ( internal OKB designations of I @-@ 301 and izdeliye FS ) and a small batch of ten aircraft , equipped with original German engines , was ordered during 1946 from Factory No. 1 in Kazan before flight testing was completed . They were intended to be used in the parade , but bad weather forced the cancellation of their flypast . Two of them were assigned to participate in the state acceptance trials while others were used as testbeds for various programs . The trials were concluded in June and the MiG @-@ 9 generally met the performance goals set by the Council of People 's Commissars . The test pilots found the fighter easy and simple to fly . Defects noted during testing were that the engines flamed out when firing the cannon at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion , no ejection seat was fitted , nor were air brakes or a fire suppression system . The fuel tanks were not self @-@ sealing and no armor was provided for the pilot . Despite these drawbacks , the MiG @-@ 9 was ordered into production at Factory No. 1 before the acceptance tests were completed as the Soviet leadership believed that its shortcomings could be rectified during production . A batch of 50 aircraft , 40 single @-@ seat fighters and 10 two @-@ seat trainers , were ordered in late 1946 to participate in the 1947 May Day parade . In recognition of their accomplishment Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1947 . 
 The two @-@ seat trainer had the internal OKB designations of I @-@ <unk> and izdeliye FT and the first prototype was converted from one of the " parade " aircraft during 1946 . Its fuel capacity had to be reduced by one third to make room for the second tandem cockpit . Dual controls were fitted as was an intercom to allow the instructor and student to communicate in the air . Each man had an ejection seat designed after that used by the Germans in their Heinkel He 162 fighter . This aircraft was delivered on 17 January 1947 , although flight testing was not completed until 5 April . The ejection seats were not tested in the air , but they required extensive testing on the ground to ensure the proper operation of the seat . State acceptance trials were not completed until 2 June and the aircraft was rejected because of the poor visibility from the rear cockpit . A second aircraft was completed on 15 July and the visibility from the rear cockpit was improved by replacing the original bulletproof windscreen with a larger glass plate , reshaping the canopy 's side panels , and removing a partition between the cockpits . This aircraft was fitted with air brakes in the wings and two 260 @-@ litre ( 57 imp gal ; 69 US gal ) drop tanks hung under its wingtips . It passed its state acceptance trials later in 1947 and was recommended for production with the service designation of UTI MiG @-@ 9 . The ejection seats were extensively tested during 1948 and approved for use , but by this time the aircraft was deemed obsolete and there was no point in building a training version . 
 The order for 50 aircraft placed in 1946 was modified to 48 single seaters and one aircraft for the OKB itself , all lacking armament . They were manufactured in March – April 1947 with the standard armament of one 37 mm Nudelman N @-@ 37 autocannon , with 40 rounds , and two 23 mm Nudelman @-@ Suranov NS @-@ 23 guns , but the production line shut down afterward to incorporate some of the desired changes . These included reinforcement and enlargement of the vertical tail to improve lateral stability ; air brakes were added on the wings and the fuel system was improved . The underside of the rear fuselage was recontoured to smooth the air flow of the engine exhaust and air suction inside the fuselage was eliminated . Production restarted and a total of 243 single seaters were completed during the remainder of the year . 250 fighters and 60 trainers were scheduled to be built in 1948 , but production was disrupted by preparations to begin manufacture of the vastly superior MiG @-@ 15 later that year . Only 302 fighters were delivered that year before production ceased . 
 The fourth and fifth aircraft of the parade batch were used in flight tests to eliminate the engine flameout problem from late 1947 through early 1948 . They were fitted with a prominent rectangular hollow vane on the barrel of the N @-@ 37 cannon that was nicknamed the " butterfly " ( <unk> ) . This allowed all three cannon to be fired simultaneously at altitudes up to 10 @,@ 100 meters ( 33 @,@ 100 ft ) , but the fin disintegrated after only 813 shots , which could be very dangerous if the debris from the fin was ingested by the engines . An additional problem was that the fin hampered the directional stability of the aircraft and caused it to yaw after 3 – 5 shots . Another attempt to fix the problem was made in the I @-@ 302 ( izdeliye FP ) , a modification of a production aircraft , that moved the N @-@ 37 to the port side of the aircraft , but this was apparently not successful either . Other attempts to ameliorate the problem included fitting a muzzle brake on the N @-@ 37 as well as extending its barrel , but nothing worked .

 The I @-@ 305 ( izdeliye FT ) was a MiG @-@ 9 airframe with a single Lyulka TR @-@ 1 turbojet of 1 @,@ 500 kgf ( 15 kN ; 3 @,@ 300 lbf ) that replaced the pair of RD @-@ 20 turbojets . The armament was rearranged with the 23 mm cannon moved to each side of the fuselage , even with the N @-@ 37 gun in the centerline bulkhead ; the latter 's ammunition supply was increased to 45 rounds . The aircraft was intended to have a pressurized cockpit and its overall weight was reduced to 4 @,@ 500 kilograms ( 9 @,@ 900 lb ) . The engine , however , was not ready for testing and the aircraft 's development was cancelled after the prototype MiG @-@ 15 began flight testing in early 1948 . 
 In mid @-@ 1946 , the Council of Ministers ordered the development of a MiG @-@ 9 with afterburning versions of the RD @-@ 20 , based on the BMW <unk> engine . These engines had a maximum power of 1 @,@ 000 – 1 @,@ 050 kgf ( 9 @.@ 8 – 10 @.@ 3 kN ; 2 @,@ 200 – 2 @,@ 300 lbf ) and were intended to increase the aircraft 's speed to 920 km / h ( 570 mph ) at sea level and 950 km / h ( 590 mph ) at 5 @,@ 000 meters ( 16 @,@ 000 ft ) . The OKB was directed to build two prototypes , with a 45 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) gun replacing the N @-@ 37 , that would begin flight tests in April 1947 . The OKB added 12 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 47 in ) armor plates fore and aft to protect the pilot and he was provided with a bulletproof windscreen , but no other changes were made to the aircraft . The I @-@ 307 ( izdeliye FF ) was ready for flight testing a month late and had to use German engines because the Soviet @-@ built versions had not yet been tested . Manufacturer 's flight tests were completed on 21 June and the fighter began its state acceptance trials on 2 August , after its engines were replaced , but crashed on 19 August . The second prototype was converted from the fifth aircraft of the parade batch and retained the butterfly used during its earlier gun trials . It was given the same cockpit armor and windscreen as the first prototype , but it used Soviet @-@ built RD @-@ <unk> ( later RD @-@ 21 ) engines . It began its flight trials in December and it demonstrated a top speed of 947 km / h ( 588 mph ) at an altitude of 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 9 @,@ 843 ft ) and 928 km / h ( 577 mph ) at 5 @,@ 200 meters ( 17 @,@ 100 ft ) , but no further development work was done . Some late @-@ production aircraft received this engine . 
 Another prototype equipped with RD @-@ 21 engines and a pressurized cockpit was completed in June 1947 . It was known internally as the I @-@ 307 ( izdeliye FR ) and was given the service designation of MiG @-@ 9M . The armament was rearranged in another attempt to ameliorate the gun gas ingestion problem with the N @-@ 37 being mounted on the starboard side of the fuselage and the two NS @-@ 23s on the port side , well aft so that the gun barrels did not protrude beyond the air intake . This caused the cockpit to be moved forward slightly which gave the pilot a better view when landing . The number of fuel tanks was reduced to five , but the aircraft 's total capacity remained the same . It made its first flight in July , but the factory flight tests were not completed until early 1948 . Despite a top speed of 965 km / h ( 600 mph ) at 5 @,@ 000 meters ( 16 @,@ 000 ft ) , it failed its state acceptance tests . The reasons given were that the engines continued to flame out if they were run at low rpm at altitudes above 8 @,@ 000 meters ( 26 @,@ 000 ft ) , the mounts for the cannon were not fully developed and the workmanship of the pressurized cockpit was low . The real reason was that the aircraft was inferior to the MiG @-@ 15 already in flight testing . 
 Another re @-@ engined version of the MiG @-@ 9 was the I @-@ 320 ( izdeliye FN ) . It had an imported Rolls @-@ Royce Nene I centrifugal @-@ flow turbojet rated at 2 @,@ 230 kgf ( 21 @.@ 9 kN ; 4 @,@ 900 lbf ) and the armament was rearranged yet again in another attempt to eliminate the gas ingestion problem . The N @-@ 37 cannon was moved to the underside of the fuselage and the NS @-@ 23 guns were moved to each side of the fuselage as in the I @-@ 305 , although none of the gun barrels protruded past the lips of the air intakes . Construction began in late 1947 , but it was never completed as the MiG @-@ 15 prototype used the same engine and had a higher performance . 
 One MiG @-@ 9 ( izdeliye FK ) was modified in 1949 to serve as a testbed for the Raduga KS @-@ 1 Komet air @-@ launched anti @-@ shipping cruise missile . A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator . The aircraft was fitted with two radars , a K @-@ 1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet @-@ shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft @-@ looking radar mounted in a cigar @-@ shaped fairing at the top of the vertical stabilizer . This latter system was intended to test the mid @-@ course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile . Signals from the K @-@ 1M radar were received in small bullet @-@ shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings . The aircraft served in this role for four years , until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952 – 53 .

 = 2011 Philadelphia , Mississippi tornado = 
 During the afternoon of April 27 , 2011 , a violent EF5 tornado touched down in eastern Mississippi , killing three people . Part of the historic 2011 Super Outbreak , the largest tornado outbreak on record , this was the first of four EF5 tornadoes to touch down that day and the first such storm in Mississippi since the 1966 Candlestick Park tornado . While on the ground for 30 minutes , it traveled along a near 29 @-@ mile ( 47 km ) path through four counties , leaving behind three deaths , eight injuries , and $ 1 @.@ 1 million in damage . 
 The supercell thunderstorm that produced this tornado formed around 1 : 00 p.m. CDT south of Jackson , Mississippi . Traveling briskly to the northeast , it became severe within 25 minutes and potentially tornadic by 1 : 36 p.m. CDT . A tornado finally touched down at 2 : 30 p.m. CDT just east of the Philadelphia Municipal Airport . It quickly intensified and began producing EF5 damage by 2 : 38 p.m. CDT ; extreme ground scouring , up to 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) deep in places , occurred in northeastern Neshoba County . After crossing into Kemper County , the tornado obliterated a mobile home , killing all three inside . It reached EF5 strength a second time near the Kemper – Winston county line where extreme ground scouring again took place and pavement was scoured from roads . Extensive tree damage took place elsewhere along the track and it ultimately dissipated at 3 : 00 p.m. CDT about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) north of <unk> . 
 = = Meteorological synopsis = = 
 The environmental conditions leading up to the April 2011 Super Outbreak were among the " most conducive to violent tornadoes ever documented " . On April 25 , a vigorous upper @-@ level shortwave trough moved into the Southern Plains states . Ample instability , low @-@ level moisture , and wind shear fueled a significant tornado outbreak from Texas to Tennessee ; at least 64 tornadoes touched down that same day . An area of low pressure consolidated over Texas on April 26 and traveled east while the aforementioned shortwave trough traversed the Mississippi River and Ohio River valleys . Another 50 tornadoes touched down on that day . The multi @-@ day outbreak culminated on April 27 with the most violent recorded day of tornadic activity since the 1974 Super Outbreak . Multiple episodes of tornadic activity ensued with two waves of mesoscale convective systems in the morning hours , followed by a widespread outbreak of supercells from Mississippi to North Carolina during the afternoon into the evening . 
 Activity on April 27 was precipitated by a 995 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 39 inHg ) surface low situated over Kentucky and a deep , negatively tilted ( aligned northwest to southeast ) trough over Arkansas and Louisiana . A strong southwesterly surface jet intersected these systems at a 60 ° angle , an <unk> flow that led to storm @-@ relative helicity values in excess of 500 <unk> @-@ 2 — indicative of extreme wind shear and a very high potential for rotating updrafts within supercells . Ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico was brought north across the Deep South , leading to daytime high temperatures of 77 to 81 ° F ( 25 to 27 ° C ) and <unk> of 66 to 72 ° F ( 19 to 22 ° C ) . Furthermore , convective available potential energy ( CAPE ) values reached 2 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 J / kg @-@ 1 .

 Around 1 : 00 p.m. CDT , a supercell thunderstorm developed south of Jackson , Mississippi , and traveled northeast at 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) . About 25 minutes later , the intensifying storm became severe and prompted a severe thunderstorm warning — advising residents of damaging winds in excess of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) and 1 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) diameter hail — from the National Weather Service office in Jackson for Leake , Rankin , and Scott counties . The developing storm gradually developed a hook echo signature , and a tornado warning was issued for Leake and Scott counties at 1 : 36 p.m. CDT , and extended to Neshoba County at 2 : 03 p.m. CDT . At 2 : 30 p.m. CDT , the storm produced a small tornado along the northern edge of Philadelphia , just east of Philadelphia Municipal Airport and near an Army National Guard armory . Here , large trees were downed and a building sustained significant roof damage . Within minutes , the tornado began producing EF2 damage to homes and other structures . It soon grew to 900 yards ( 820 m ) in diameter and warranted the issuance of a tornado emergency for northeastern Neshoba County at 2 : 36 p.m. CDT . 
 Traveling along and parallel to Highway 21 , the tornado leveled and partially swept away a brick home near the intersection with Highway 491 , indicative of low @-@ end EF4 damage . A debris ball was apparent on Doppler weather radar imagery by this time . The storm began producing EF5 damage at 2 : 38 p.m. CDT in northeastern Neshoba County . Tremendous ground scouring took place in the county , with up to 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) of soil removed . Grass was torn out by the roots and in clumps by suction vortices embedded within the tornado . Large trees were entirely uprooted , debarked , defoliated , and thrown up to 20 yards ( 18 m ) as well . Maximum winds in the tornado were estimated at 205 mph ( 330 km / h ) . The storm moved through the Pearl River Resort , where it destroyed a historic log cabin , fencing , lighting , and dugouts at two baseball fields . As the storm neared the edge of Neshoba County , the tornado emergency was extended to include northern Kemper County , southeastern Winston County , and all of Noxubee County . The tornado weakened briefly as it passed through the small community of Coy along the Neshoba – Kemper border . Extensive tree damage took place in the area and a mobile home was destroyed . Upon leaving the community , the tornado intensified and produced EF5 damage again by 2 : 47 p.m. CDT . Throughout Neshoba County , the tornado damaged or destroyed 91 structures , rendering 32 people homeless . 
 In Kemper County , a 3 @,@ 000 ft2 ( 280 m2 ) mini @-@ mart was damaged beyond repair . Eleven people sought refuge inside the building 's bathroom when the tornado struck ; all escaped without injury . Along the border of Kemper and Winston counties , EF5 damage occurred as extremely deep ground scouring took place again and asphalt was ripped from roads . On Green Road , a double @-@ wide mobile home , anchored to the ground , was lofted 300 yards ( 270 m ) and obliterated when it landed in a nearby tree line ; debris from the home was scattered hundreds of yards farther . The survey team found no evidence of it having bounced or rolled from where it was picked up to where it impacted the tree line . All three occupants were killed , the sole fatalities from this tornado . Nearby , the tornado weakened to EF3 <unk> as two brick homes were destroyed with barely any interior walls left standing ; two people sustained serious injuries . A well @-@ built frame wood home was nearly swept clean off its foundation and two trailers were destroyed . Cars were hurled hundreds of yards , often bouncing along the way , and some were rendered almost unrecognizable and were wrapped around trees . Continuing through southeastern Winston County , the tornado weakened slightly to EF2 strength but continued to produce extensive tree and property damage . As it crossed Central McDonald Road , it destroyed a single @-@ wide mobile home and leveled a nearby grove of pine trees . 
 As the tornado approached the Winston – Noxubee border , it caused substantial roof damage to a church and left impact holes in the back wall . Extreme tree damage was noted along the border as the tornado regained EF3 intensity . Along Butler Road , to the southwest of Macon , additional pavement scouring took place , along with the destruction of a shop and a bus being rolled . Thereafter , the tornado steadily weakened before dissipating roughly 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) north of <unk> at 3 : 00 p.m. CDT . Throughout its 30 minute track , the tornado traveled almost 29 miles ( 47 km ) , killed three people , injured eight others , and caused $ 1 @.@ 1 million in damage . 
 The supercell that produced this EF5 tornado later spawned an EF1 in northeastern Noxubee County at 3 : 18 p.m. CDT . The parent storm dissipated around 3 : 29 p.m. CDT as another supercell overtook it near the Mississippi – Alabama state line . The cell produced an exceptionally long @-@ lived EF4 that traveled nearly 124 miles ( 200 km ) across Alabama . The Philadelphia tornado marked the first instance of an F5 or EF5 tornado in Mississippi since the March 3 , 1966 , Candlestick Park tornado . Following another EF5 that struck Smithville later on April 27 , the outbreak marked the first known instance of two EF5 tornadoes on a single day in Mississippi . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Immediately following the destructive tornadoes , Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour declared a state of emergency for 39 counties . On April 29 , President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for 29 Mississippi counties in the wake of the Super Outbreak and another deadly outbreak on April 15 . This allowed residents and some local governments to sign up to receive federal funding to repair damage incurred from the storms . More than 60 members of the Longino Baptist Church assisted residents of Neshoba County with debris removal and cleaning ; also providing refreshments . The Salvation Army established a feeding center at the Coy Methodist Church . Disaster unemployment assistance was made available for people who lost their jobs due to storms and flooding , starting on May 17 . By July , a total of $ 15 @,@ 734 @,@ 072 in federal funding was approved through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for victims of the April 15 – 28 storms . 
 = Pomeranian ( dog ) = 
 The Pomeranian ( often known as a Pom or Pom Pom ) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type , named for the Pomerania region in Central Europe ( today part of northern Poland and eastern Germany ) . <unk> as a toy dog breed because of its small size , the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz type dogs , specifically the German Spitz . It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed ; and in many countries , they are known as the <unk> ( " Dwarf @-@ Spitz " ) . 
 The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century . Queen Victoria owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently the smaller variety became universally popular . During Queen Victoria 's lifetime alone , the size of the breed decreased by 50 % . Overall , the Pomeranian is a sturdy , healthy dog . The most common health issues are luxating patella and tracheal collapse . More rarely , the breed can suffer from <unk> X , a skin condition colloquially known as " black skin disease " . This is a genetic disease which causes the dog 's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair . As at 2013 , in terms of registration figures , since at least 1998 , the breed has ranked among the top twenty most popular breeds in the USA , and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide . 
 = = Appearance = = 
 Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1 @.@ 9 – 3 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 4 @.@ 2 – 7 @.@ 7 lb ) and standing 5 @.@ 0 – 11 inches ( 13 – 28 cm ) high at the withers . They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat . The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck , which Poms are well known for , and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters . 
 The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black . Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888 , which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century . In modern times , the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed , including white , black , brown , red , orange , cream , blue , sable , black and tan , brown and tan , spotted , brindle , plus combinations of those colors . The most common colors are orange , black or cream / white . 
 The merle Pomeranian is a recent color developed by breeders . It is a combination of a solid base color with lighter blue / grey patch which gives a mottled effect . The most common base colors for the effect are red / brown or black , although it can also appear with other colors . Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard . In addition , the eye , nose and paw pad are marshmallow color , changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black . 
 Pomeranians have a thick , double coat . While grooming is not difficult , breeders recommend that it be done daily to maintain the quality of the coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding , with trimming every 1 – 2 months . The outer coat is long , straight , and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft , thick and short . The coat knots and tangles easily , particularly when the undercoat is being shed , which happens twice a year . 
 = = Temperament = = 
 Pomeranians are typically friendly , playful and lively but are often aggressive to other dogs and try to prove themselves Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation . They are somewhat defensive of their territory and will thus bark a lot when they encounter any outside noises . Pomeranians are intelligent dogs , respond well to training , and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners . They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention but can become quite aggressive and dominant if not well trained . The use of toys can be an effective tool in encouraging <unk> to spend time alone . 
 = = Health = = 
 = = = Overall health = = = 
 The life expectancy of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years . A well @-@ bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems ; and , if kept trim and fit , a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog . The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds , although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian 's lightweight build . Some health issues can develop as a result of lack of attention to grooming and <unk> , <unk> , and eye @-@ cleaning . With routine care , these problems can be avoided . They are prone to early tooth loss , and dry food is recommended . Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size , with various source giving numbers of between 1 @.@ 9 and 2 @.@ 7 puppies per litter . 
 = = = Common problems = = = 
 Merle colored dogs may suffer from mild to severe deafness , increased intraocular pressure , <unk> , microphthalmia , and <unk> . Merle dogs born from parents who are also both <unk> may additionally suffer from abnormalities of the skeletal , cardiac and reproductive systems . 
 <unk> patella is another health issue in the Pomeranian breed . It occurs when , through either malformation or trauma , the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely . This can cause the patella to " <unk> " ( jump out of the groove ) sideways which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the ground . While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position . The initial pain is caused by the knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur . Once out of position , the dog does not feel any pain caused by the slipped disc . 
 Tracheal collapse is caused by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe . It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse , closing the airway . The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk , an intolerance to exercise , fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather , exercise and excitement . The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages . 
 In Pomeranians , a condition often called " black skin disease " occurs which is a combination of alopecia ( hair loss ) and hyperpigmentation ( a darkening of the skin ) . Other names for this condition include woolly coat , coat funk , pseudo @-@ Cushing 's disease , or severe hair loss syndrome . This condition affects male Pomeranians more than females , and may be inherited . Although most affected dogs show signs following puberty , it can occur at any age . Other conditions can mimic this condition including Cushing 's syndrome , hypothyroidism , chronic skin infections , and reproductive hormone disorders . 
 Another common disorder in male Pomeranians is cryptorchidism . This is when either one or both of the testicles do not descend into the scrotum . It is treated through surgical removal of the retained testicle . 
 = = = Exercise = = = 
 The Pomeranian is a small but energetic breed of dog . Although Pomeranians benefit from frequent attention , they need relatively little exercise : it is recommended to take them on a short daily walk or let them run around an enclosed space . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 The forerunners of today 's Pomeranian breed were large working dogs from the Arctic regions . These dogs are commonly known as the <unk> or Spitz type , which is German for " sharp point " which was the term originally used by Count Eberhard zu Sayn in the 16th Century as a reference to the features of the dog 's nose and muzzle . The Pomeranian is considered to be descended from the German Spitz . 
 The breed is thought to have acquired its name by association with the area known as Pomerania which is located in northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea . Although not the origin of the breed , this area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog . Proper documentation was lacking until the breed 's introduction into the United Kingdom . 
 An early modern recorded reference to the Pomeranian breed is from 2 November 1764 , in a diary entry in James Boswell 's Boswell on the Grand Tour : Germany and Switzerland . " The Frenchman had a Pomeranian dog named <unk> whom he was mighty fond of . " The offspring of a Pomeranian and a wolf bred by an animal merchant from London is discussed in Thomas Pennant 's A Tour in Scotland from 1769 . 
 Two members of the British Royal Family influenced the evolution of the breed . In 1767 , Queen Charlotte , Queen @-@ consort of King George III of England , brought two Pomeranians to England . 
 Named Phoebe and Mercury , the dogs were depicted in paintings by Sir Thomas Gainsborough . These paintings depicted a dog larger than the modern breed , reportedly weighing as much as 30 – 50 lb ( 14 – 23 kg ) , but showing modern traits such as the heavy coat , ears and a tail curled over the back . 
 Queen Victoria , Queen Charlotte 's granddaughter , was also an enthusiast and established a large breeding kennel . One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian which she possibly named " Windsor 's Marco " and was reported to weigh only 12 lb ( 5 @.@ 4 kg ) . When she first exhibited Marco in 1891 , it caused the smaller type Pomeranian to become immediately popular and breeders began selecting only the smaller specimens for breeding . During her lifetime , the size of the Pomeranian breed was reported to have decreased by 50 % . Queen Victoria worked to improve and promote the Pomeranian breed by importing smaller Pomeranians of different colors from various European countries to add to her breeding program . Royal owners during this period also included Joséphine de Beauharnais , the wife of Napoleon I of France , and King George IV of England . 
 The first breed club was set up in England in 1891 , and the first breed standard was written shortly afterwards . The first member of the breed was registered in America to the American Kennel Club in 1898 , and it was recognized in 1900 . 
 In 1912 , two Pomeranians were among only three dogs to survive the sinking of RMS Titanic . A Pomeranian called " Lady " , owned by Miss Margaret Hays , escaped with her owner in lifeboat number seven , while Elizabeth Barrett Rothschild took her pet to safety with her in lifeboat number six . 
 Glen Rose <unk> won the Toy Group at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1926 , the first Pomeranian to win a group at Westminster . It would take until 1988 for the first Pomeranian , " Great Elms Prince Charming II " , to win the Best in Show prize from the Westminster Kennel Club . 
 In the standard published in 1998 , the Pomeranian is included in the German Spitz standard , along with the <unk> , by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale . According to the standard " Spitz breeds are captivating " and have a " unique characteristic , cheeky appearance . " 
 = = = Popularity = = = 
 The Pomeranian has been among the more popular dog breeds in the United States , featuring consistently in the top 20 of registered AKC dog breeds since at least 1998 , when it was ranked # 10 ; the breed was # 17 in the 2011 rankings , dropping two spots from the previous year . In 2012 and 2013 it remained in the top twenty and was ranked at # 19 . 
 It is not listed in the top 20 breeds in the UK in either 2007 or 2008 . In Australia their popularity has declined since 1986 , with a peak of 1128 Pomeranians registered with the Australian National Kennel Council in 1987 ; only 577 were registered in 2008 . However , this is an increase from 2004 , when only 491 dogs were registered . 
 It is more popular in American cities in 2008 , ranking joint tenth ( with American Bulldog ) in Detroit and Orlando , ninth in Los Angeles , a joint seventh in Seattle ( again , with the American Bulldog ) , but third in Honolulu , only bested by the Labrador Retriever and the German Shepherd Dog .

 At age five , she joined a drama group and developed public speaking skills . At that same time , Lorde was attending Vauxhall School and later Belmont Intermediate School . Her mother encouraged her to read a range of genres , which Lorde cited as a lyrical influence , " I guess my mum influenced my lyrical style by always buying me books . She 'd give me a mixture of kid and adult books too , there weren 't really any books I wasn 't allowed to read . I remember reading Feed by M.T.

 In May 2009 , Lorde and musician friend Louis McDonald won the Belmont Intermediate School annual talent show as a duo . On August 13 , 2009 , Lorde and McDonald were invited in for a chat on Jim Mora 's Afternoons show on Radio New Zealand . There , they performed covers of Pixie Lott 's " Mama Do ( Uh Oh , Uh Oh ) " and Kings of Leon 's " Use Somebody " . McDonald 's father Ian sent both his home audio recording of her and Louis McDonald covering Duffy 's song " Warwick Avenue " and his home video recording of the pair singing Pixie Lott 's " Mama Do " to Universal Music Group ( UMG ) ' s A & R Scott Maclachlan . In 2009 Maclachlan signed her to UMG for development . Lorde was also part of the Belmont Intermediate School band Extreme ; the band placed third in the North Shore Battle of the Bands finals at the Bruce Mason Centre , Takapuna , Auckland on 18 November 2009 . 
 In 2010 Lorde and McDonald performed covers live on a regular basis as a duet called " Ella & Louis " , playing at The Leigh Sawmill Cafe on 15 August , at Roasted <unk> Cafe in Kingsland on 20 August , at The Vic Unplugged at Victoria Theatre , Devonport on 27 October , and at <unk> in Devonport on 12 December . While working on her music career , she attended Takapuna Grammar School from 2010 to 2013 , completing Year Twelve . She later chose not to return in 2014 to finish Year Thirteen . 
 In 2011 , UMG hired vocal coach Frances Dickinson to give Lorde singing lessons twice a week for a year . During this time , she began writing songs and was set up with a succession of songwriters , but without success . At the age of fourteen , Lorde started reading short fiction and learned how to " put words together " . She performed her own original songs publicly for the first time at The Vic Unplugged II on the Devonport Victoria Theatre main stage on 16 November 2011 . In December 2011 , MacLachlan paired Lorde with Joel Little , a songwriter , record producer , and former Goodnight Nurse lead singer .

 = Clotted cream = 
 Clotted cream ( sometimes called scalded , <unk> , Devonshire or Cornish cream ) is a thick cream made by indirectly heating full @-@ cream cow 's milk using steam or a water bath and then leaving it in shallow pans to cool slowly . During this time , the cream content rises to the surface and forms " clots " or " <unk> " . It forms an essential part of a cream tea . 
 Although its origin is uncertain , the cream 's production is commonly associated with dairy farms in southwest England and in particular the counties of Cornwall and Devon . The current largest commercial producer in the UK is Rodda 's in Redruth , Cornwall , which can produce up to 25 tons ( 25 @,@ 000 kg ; 55 @,@ 000 lb ) of clotted cream a day . In 1998 the term Cornish clotted cream became a Protected Designation of Origin ( PDO ) by European Union directive , as long as the milk is produced in Cornwall and the minimum fat content is 55 % . 
 = = Description = = 
 Clotted cream has been described as having a " nutty , cooked milk " flavour , and a " rich sweet flavour " with a texture that is grainy , sometimes with oily globules on the crusted surface . It is a thick cream , with a very high fat content ( a minimum of 55 percent , but an average of 64 percent ) ; in the United States it would be classified as butter . For comparison , the fat content of single cream is only 18 percent . Despite its popularity , virtually none is exported due to its short shelf life . 
 Due to its high saturated fat content , the regular consumption of clotted cream is usually thought to be bad for health , though some dairy fat in the diet is considered beneficial . A 2006 survey of nutrition professionals ranked clotted cream as the least healthy of 120 foods selected to be representative of the British diet . According to the United Kingdom 's Food Standards Agency , a 100 @-@ gram ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) tub of clotted cream provides 586 kilocalories ( 2 @,@ 450 kJ ) , roughly equivalent to a 200 @-@ gram ( 7 @.@ 1 oz ) cheeseburger . 
 = = History = = 
 Originally made by farmers to reduce the amount of waste from their milk , clotted cream has become so deep @-@ rooted in the culture of southwest Britain that it is embedded as part of the region 's tourist attraction . While there is no doubt of its strong and long association with Cornwall and Devon , it is not clear of its actual antiquity , or more recent development . 
 The Oxford Companion to Food follows traditional folklore by suggesting it may have been introduced to Cornwall by Phoenician traders in search of tin . It is similar to kaymak ( or <unk> ) , a Near Eastern delicacy that is made throughout the Middle East , southeast Europe , Iran , Afghanistan , India , and Turkey . A similar clotted cream known as ' <unk> ' ( <unk> ) is also made in Mongolia . 
 However , contemporary ancient food experts , noting Strabo 's commentaries on Britain ; 
 " They live off their herds ... As they have mines of tin and lead , they give these metals and hides from their cattle to the sea traders ... instead of olive oil they use butter . " 
 have proposed that the early Britons would probably have clotted cream to preserve its freshness . 
 More recently , regional archaeologists have associated the stone <unk> ( dial . ' <unk> @-@ hole ' ) , or souterrains , found across Atlantic Britain , France , and Ireland as a possible form of " cold store " for dairy production of milk , cream , and cheese in particular . Similar functions are ascribed the <unk> ( dial . ' lean @-@ to ' ) stone @-@ built form , often used as a dairy in later medieval longhouses in the same regions . 
 It has long been disputed whether clotted cream originated in Devon or Cornwall , and which county makes it the best . There is evidence that the monks of Tavistock Abbey were making clotted cream in the early 14th century . After their abbey had been ransacked by Vikings in 997 CE , the monks rebuilt it with the help of <unk> , Earl of Devon . Local workers were drafted in to help with the repairs , and the monks rewarded them with bread , clotted cream , and strawberry preserves . The 1658 cookery book The Compleat Cook had a recipe for " <unk> cream " . 
 In the 19th century it was regarded as better nourishment than " raw " cream because that cream was liable to go sour and be difficult to digest , causing illness . An article from 1853 calculates that creating clotted cream will produce 25 percent more cream than regular methods . In Devon , it was so common that in the mid @-@ 19th century it was used in the formative processes of butter , instead of churning cream or milk . The butter made in this way had a longer lifespan and was free from any negative flavours added by the churning . 
 It has long been the practice for local residents in southwest England , or those on holiday , to send small tins or tubs of clotted cream by post to friends and relations in other parts of the British Isles . Food regulations for perishable goods prohibit it being sent abroad . 
 = = = EU directives = = = 
 In 1993 , an application was made for the name Cornish clotted cream to have a Protected Designation of Origin ( PDO ) in the European Union for cream produced by the traditional recipe in Cornwall . This was accepted in 1998 . Cornish clotted cream must be made from milk produced in Cornwall and have a minimum butterfat content of 55 percent . The unique , slightly yellow , Cornish clotted cream colour is due to the high carotene levels in the grass . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 Traditionally , clotted cream was created by straining fresh cow 's milk , letting it stand in a shallow pan in a cool place for several hours to allow the cream to rise to the surface , then heating it either over hot cinders or in a water bath , before a slow cooling . The clots that had formed on the top were then skimmed off with a long @-@ handled cream @-@ skimmer , known in Devon as a <unk> or <unk> . By the mid @-@ 1930s , the traditional way of using milk brought straight from the dairy was becoming a rarity in Devon because using a cream separator actively separated the cream from the milk using centrifugal force , which produced far more clotted cream than the traditional method from the same amount of milk . As a farmer 's wife in <unk> said , " the separator saves a whole cow ! " 
 Today , there are two distinct modern methods for making clotted cream . The " float cream method " includes scalding a floating layer of double cream in milk ( skimmed or whole ) in shallow trays . To scald , the trays are heated using steam or very hot water . After the mixture has been heated for up to an hour it is slowly cooled for 12 hours or more , before the cream is separated and packaged . The " scald cream method " is similar , but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used . This cream is then heated in a similar manner , but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged . In the United Kingdom the resultant cream is deemed to be equivalent to pasteurised for legal purposes . Unlike pasteurisation , however , there is no requirement for the temperatures to be recorded on <unk> charts . As the temperatures are lower than used in standard pasteurisation , much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene . 
 The largest UK manufacturer is Rodda 's , a family @-@ owned business based in <unk> , Cornwall . Founded in 1890 , the company was producing over 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 pounds ( 450 @,@ 000 kg ) per year in 1985 , and in 2010 the managing director said that they might produce as little as 5 or 6 tons ( 5 @,@ 000 or 6 @,@ 000 kg ) a day in January , but up to 25 tons ( 25 @,@ 000 kg ) a day as Christmas approached . In the early 1980s , Rodda 's signed deals with international airlines to serve small tubs of clotted cream with the in @-@ flight desserts . The company considers the annual Wimbledon tennis championships one of their peak selling periods . As a by @-@ product , for every 100 imperial gallons ( 450 l ; 120 US gal ) of milk used , 94 imperial gallons ( 430 l ; 113 US gal ) of skimmed milk is produced , which is then used in food manufacture . 
 One Devon manufacturer , Definitely Devon was purchased by Robert Wiseman Dairies in March 2006 , closing one of the two Devon dairies and moving all production to Okehampton . However , in 2011 Robert Wiseman sold the Definitely Devon Brand to Rodda 's , who moved the production of Definitely Devon to Cornwall , which caused some controversy as the name was not changed , prompting an investigation by Trading Standards . 
 Throughout Cornwall and southwest England , clotted cream manufacture is a cottage industry , with many farms and dairies producing cream for sale in local outlets . Clotted cream is also produced in Somerset , Dorset , Herefordshire , Pembrokeshire , and the Isle of Wight . 
 When authentic clotted cream is not available , there are ways to create a substitute product , such as by mixing <unk> with whipped cream , a little sugar , and vanilla extract .

 Clotted cream is an essential part of a cream tea , a favourite with tourists in Cornwall and Devon . It is served on scones — or the more traditional " splits " in Cornwall — with strawberry or raspberry jam , along with a pot of tea . Traditionally , there are differences in the way it is eaten in each county : in Devon , the cream is traditionally spread first on the <unk> , with the jam <unk> on top . In Cornwall the jam is spread first with a dollop of cream . Cream teas spread to southern Australia as early immigrants from Cornwall and Devon took their traditional recipes with them . In 2010 , Langage Farm in Devon started a campaign for " Devon cream tea " to have protected designation of origin similar to " Cornish clotted cream " . One variation on a cream tea is called " Thunder and Lightning " which consists of a round of bread topped with clotted cream and golden syrup , honey , or treacle .

 Clotted cream was mentioned in The Shepheardes Calendar , a poem by Edmund Spenser in 1579 : 
 As with many Cornish and Devonian icons , clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore .

Another myth , from Dartmoor , tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince , but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first . Unfortunately , a witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream . Eventually , the prince offered the princess clotted cream , which the witch was unable to sour . 
 = Edmund Andros = 
 Sir Edmund Andros ( 6 December 1637 – 24 February 1714 ) was an English colonial administrator in North America . He was the governor of the Dominion of New England during most of its three @-@ year existence . At other times , Andros served as governor of the provinces of New York , East and West Jersey , Virginia , and Maryland . 
 Before his service in North America , he served as bailiff of Guernsey . His tenure in New England was authoritarian and turbulent , as his views were decidedly pro @-@ Anglican , a negative quality in a region home to many Puritans . His actions in New England resulted in his overthrow during the 1689 Boston revolt . 
 Andros was considered to have been a more effective governor in New York and Virginia , although he became the enemy of prominent figures in both colonies , many of whom worked to remove him from office . Despite these enmities , he managed to negotiate several treaties of the Covenant Chain with the Iroquois , establishing a long @-@ lived peace involving the colonies and other tribes that interacted with that confederacy . His actions and governance generally followed the instructions he was given upon appointment to office , and he received approbation from the monarchs and governments that appointed him . 
 Andros was recalled to England from Virginia in 1698 , and resumed the title of bailiff of Guernsey . Although he no longer resided entirely on Guernsey , he was appointed lieutenant governor of the island , and served in this position for four years . Andros died in 1714 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Andros was born in London on 6 December 1637 . <unk> Andros , his father , was Bailiff of Guernsey and a staunch supporter of Charles I. His mother was Elizabeth Stone , whose sister was a courtier to the king 's sister , Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia . Although it has been claimed that Andros was present at the surrender in 1651 of Guernsey 's Castle Cornet , the last royalist stronghold to surrender in the English Civil War , there is no firm evidence to support this . It is possible that he fled Guernsey with his mother in 1645 . In 1656 , he was apprenticed to his uncle , Sir Robert Stone , captain of a cavalry company . Andros then served in two winter campaigns in Denmark , including the relief of Copenhagen in 1659 . As a result of these experiences he gained fluency in French , Swedish , and Dutch . 
 He remained a firm supporter of the Stuarts while they were in exile . Charles II , after his restoration to the throne , specifically commended the Andros family for its support . 
 Andros served as a courtier to Elizabeth of Bohemia from 1660 until her death in 1662 . In 1671 , he married Mary Craven , the daughter of Thomas Craven of Burnsall in the West Riding of Yorkshire ( now North Yorkshire ) , the son of a cousin to the Earl of Craven , one of the queen 's closest advisors , and a friend who served as his patron for many years . During the 1660s he served in the English army against the Dutch . He was next commissioned a major in the regiment of Sir Tobias Bridge , which was sent to Barbados in 1666 . He returned to England two years later , carrying despatches and letters . 
 = = Governor of New York = = 
 After his father died in 1674 , Andros was named to succeed as bailiff of Guernsey . He was also appointed by the Duke of York to be the first proprietary governor of the Province of New York . The province 's territory included the former territories of New Netherland , ceded to England by the Treaty of Westminster , including all of present @-@ day New Jersey , the Dutch holdings on the Hudson River from New Amsterdam ( renamed New York City ) to Albany , as well as Long Island , Martha 's Vineyard , and Nantucket . 
 In 1664 Charles II had granted James all of this territory , as well as all of the land in present @-@ day Maine between the Kennebec and St. Croix Rivers , but with the intervening Dutch retaking of the territory , Charles issued a new patent to James . Andros arrived in New York harbor in late October , and negotiated the handover of the Dutch territories with local representatives and Dutch Governor Anthony <unk> , which took place on 10 November 1674 . Andros agreed to confirm the existing property holdings and to allow the Dutch inhabitants of the territory to maintain their Protestant religion . 
 = = = Connecticut boundary dispute = = = 
 Andros was also involved in boundary disputes with the neighboring Connecticut Colony . Dutch claims had originally extended as far east as the Connecticut River , but these claims had been ceded in the 1650 Treaty of Hartford , and reduced to a boundary line 20 miles ( 32 km ) east of the Hudson in 1664 . York 's territorial claim did not acknowledge these , and Andros announced to Connecticut authorities his intentions to reclaim that territory ( which included Connecticut capital , Hartford ) in early 1675 . Connecticut leaders pointed out the later revisions to Connecticut 's boundaries , but Andros pressed his claim , arguing that those revisions had been superseded by York 's grant . Andros used the outbreak of King Philip 's War in July 1675 as an excuse to go by ship to Connecticut with a small military force to establish the duke 's claim . When he arrived at Saybrook at the mouth of the river on 8 July he found the fort there occupied by Connecticut militia , who were flying the English flag . Andros came ashore , had a brief conversation with the fort commander , read his commission , and returned to New York City . This was the full extent of Andros ' attempt to claim the territory , but it would be remembered in Connecticut when later attempts were made to assert New York authority . 
 = = = King Philip 's War = = = 
 Following his Connecticut expedition , Andros traveled into Iroquois country to establish relations there . He was well received , and agreed to continue the Dutch practice of supplying firearms to the Iroquois . This action successfully blunted French diplomatic successes with the Iroquois . It also led to charges in New England that Andros provided arms to Indians allied to King Philip ( as the Wampanoag leader <unk> was known to the English ) ; in fact , Andros provided gunpowder to Rhode Island that was used in the Great Swamp Fight against the Narragansetts in December 1675 , and specifically outlawed the sale of munitions to tribes known to be allied to Philip . The charges poisoned the atmosphere between Andros and Massachusetts leaders , even though Andros ' conduct met with approval in London . 
 In the meeting with the Iroquois Andros was given the name " <unk> " , which was used thereafter by the Iroquois to refer to the New York governor ( in the same way the French governor was dubbed " <unk> " ) . One other consequence was the establishment at Albany of a colonial department for Indian affairs , with Robert Livingston as its first head . 
 Philip was known to be in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts that winter , and New Englanders accused Andros of sheltering him . Historian John Fiske suggests that Philip 's purpose was not to draw the Iroquois into the conflict , but instead to draw the Mahicans into the conflict with a view toward attacking Albany . An offer by Andros to send New York troops into Massachusetts to attack Philip was rebuffed , based on the idea that it was covert ploy to again assert authority to the Connecticut River . Instead , Mohawks from the Albany area did battle with Philip , driving him eastward . When Connecticut authorities later appealed to Andros for assistance , Andros replied that it was " strange " that they would do so , considering their previous behavior , and refused to help . 
 In July 1676 Andros established a haven for the Mahicans and other Indian war refugees at Schaghticoke . Although the conflict came to an end in southern New England in 1676 , there continued to be friction between the Abenakis of northern New England and English settlers . These prompted Andros to send a force to the duke 's territory in Maine , where they established a fort at Pemaquid ( present @-@ day Bristol ) . Andros annoyed Massachusetts fishermen by restricting their use of the duke 's land for drying fish . 
 In November 1677 Andros departed for England , where he would spend the next year . During this visit he was knighted as a reward for his performance as governor , and he sat in on meetings of the Lords of Trade in which agents for Massachusetts Bay defended its charter , and gave detailed accounts of the state of his colony . 
 = = = Southern border disputes = = = 
 The southernmost territories of the duke , roughly encompassing northern Delaware , were desired by Charles Calvert , Baron Baltimore , who sought to extend the reach of his proprietary Province of Maryland into the area . At the same time Calvert was seeking an end to a frontier war with the Iroquois to the north , having persuaded the intervening Susquehannocks to move to the Potomac River , well within Maryland territory . Furthermore , the Lenape , who dominated Delaware Bay , were unhappy with seizures of their lands by Virginia and Maryland settlers , and war between these groups had been imminent in 1673 when the Dutch retook New York . 
 When Andros came to New York , he moved to stabilize the situation . He befriended the Lenape sachems ( chiefs ) , convincing them to act as mediators between the English and other tribes . Peace appeared to be imminent when Bacon 's Rebellion broke out in Maryland , resulting in an attack on the Susquehannock fort on the Potomac . The surviving Susquehannocks sneaked out of the fort one night , some of them making their way east toward Delaware Bay . In June 1676 Andros offered , in exchange for their moving into his jurisdiction , to protect them from their enemies among the Virginian and Maryland settlers . He also extended an offer given by the Mohawk for the Susquehannocks to settle among them . These offers were well received , but Maryland authorities were unable to convince their Indian allies to make the peace offered by Andros , and organized them to march toward the Delaware , which would also fulfil the goal of strengthening the Maryland claim to the area . Andros responded by urging the Susquehannocks to retreat into New York , where they would be beyond Maryland 's reach , and delivering a strongly worded threat to Maryland , that it would either have to acknowledge his sovereignty over the Susquehannocks , or they would have to <unk> take them back . He also offered his services as a mediator , pointing out that the absence of the Susquehannocks now left Maryland settlements open to direct attack by the Iroquois . 
 In a council held at the Lenape village of Shackamaxon ( site of present @-@ day Philadelphia ) in February and March 1677 , all of the major parties met , but no final agreements were reached , and Andros ordered the Susquehannocks remaining with the Lenape to disperse to other parts of New York in April . Maryland sent Henry Coursey to New York to engage Andros and eventually the Iroquois in peace talks , while at the same time they sent surveyors to lay out plots on land also claimed by New York on Delaware Bay . Coursey was instructed to offer Andros what was in essence a £ 100 bribe that an Indian peace might be reached in exchange for that land . Andros refused the bribe , and Coursey ended up being compelled to negotiate further through Andros and the Mohawk in Albany . The peace agreed in negotiations that followed in Albany in the summer of 1677 is considered one of the foundations of the set of alliances and treaties called the Covenant Chain . 
 Although Andros was unable to prevent Baltimore from granting some land on the Delaware , he did successfully blunt the Maryland leader 's attempt to control an even greater portion of land . The duke eventually deeded those lands to William Penn , and they became part of the state of Delaware . 
 = = = Control of the Jerseys = = = 
 Governance of the Jerseys also created problems for Andros . James had awarded the territory west of the Hudson River to proprietors John Berkeley and George Carteret , and Berkeley had then deeded the western portion ( which became known as West Jersey ) to a partnership of Quakers . Berkeley had not transferred his proprietary rights to this group , and the exact nature of the rights James had given both Berkeley and Carteret was disputed , in part because James believed that the second patent granted to him in 1674 overrode the earlier grants he had made to Berkeley and Carteret . 
 This resulted in conflict when Andros attempted to extend his government over East Jersey , the territory governed on behalf of Carteret by the latter 's cousin Philip . Possibly based on orders given to him during his visit to England , Andros began to assert New York authority over East Jersey after George Carteret 's death in 1680 . Despite a friendly personal relationship between Andros and Governor Carteret , the issue of governance eventually prompted Andros to have Carteret arrested . In a dispute centering on the collection of customs duties in ports on the Jersey side of the Hudson , Andros in 1680 sent a company of soldiers to Philip Carteret 's home in Elizabethtown . According to Carteret 's account of the incident , he was beaten by the troops , who jailed him in New York . 
 In a trial over which Andros presided , Carteret was acquitted by a jury on all charges . Carteret returned to New Jersey , but injuries he sustained in the arrest affected his health , and he died in 1682 . In the aftermath of the incident the Duke of York surrendered his claims to East Jersey to the <unk> . 
 A less contentious standoff also occurred when settlers sent by William Penn sought to establish what is now Burlington , New Jersey . Andros insisted they had no right to settle there without the duke 's permission , but agreed to allow their settlement after they agreed to receive commissions falling under the authority of the New York gubernatorial administration . This situation was permanently resolved in 1680 when York renounced in favor of Penn his remaining claims to West Jersey . 
 = = = Recall and analysis = = = 
 The political opponents of Andros in the colony brought a number of charges against him to the Duke of York . Among them were accusations of favoritism toward Dutch businessmen , and engaging in business for private gain rather than that of the duke . Statements were also made to the duke that claimed that his revenues were lower than they should have been ; this , in addition to the other complaints , led the duke to order Andros back to England to explain the situation . Andros left the province in January 1681 , charging Anthony <unk> with the administration of the New York government . Expecting a short visit to England , his wife remained in New York . 
 During his time in New York he was thought to have demonstrated good administrative abilities , but his manner was considered imperious by his opponents among the colonists , and he made numerous enemies during his tenure as governor . 
 = = Dominion of New England = = 
 In 1686 he was appointed governor of the Dominion of New England . He arrived in Boston on 20 December 1686 , and immediately assumed the reins of power . His commission called for governance by himself , with a council . The initial composition of the council included representatives from each of the colonies the dominion absorbed , but because of the inconvenience of travel and the fact that travel costs were not reimbursed , the council 's quorums were dominated by representatives from Massachusetts and Plymouth . The Lords of Trade had insisted that he govern without an assembly , something he expressed concern over while his commission was being drafted . In a brief work , Sir Edmund Andros , historian Henry Ferguson attested to the fact that the deliberation of certain policies by an assembly of legislators may have proven inefficient . 
 The Dominion initially consisted of the territories of the Massachusetts Bay Colony ( including present @-@ day Maine ) , Plymouth Colony , Rhode Island , Connecticut and New Hampshire , and was extended to include New York , and East and West Jersey in 1688 . Andros ' wife , who had joined him in Boston , died there in 1688 not long after her arrival . 
 = = = Church of England = = = 
 Shortly after his arrival , Andros asked each of the Puritan churches in Boston if its meetinghouse could be used for services of the Church of England . When he was rebuffed , he demanded and was given keys to Samuel Willard 's Third Church in 1687 . Services were held there under the auspices of Rev. Robert Ratcliff until 1688 , when King 's Chapel was built . These actions highlighted him as pro @-@ Anglican in the eyes of local Puritans , who would later accuse him of involvement in a " horrid Popish plot . " 
 = = = Revenue laws = = = 
 His council engaged in a lengthy process to harmonize dominion and English laws . This work consumed such a great amount of time that Andros in March 1687 issued a proclamation stating that pre @-@ existing laws would remain in effect until they were revised . Since Massachusetts had no pre @-@ existing tax laws , a scheme of taxation was created that would apply to the entire dominion . Developed by a committee of landowners , the first proposal derived its revenues from import duties , principally alcohol . After much debate , a different proposal was abruptly proposed and adopted , essentially reviving previous Massachusetts tax laws . These laws had been unpopular with farmers who felt the taxes on livestock were too high . To bring in immediate revenue , Andros also received approval to increase the import duties on alcohol . 
 The first attempts to enforce the revenue laws were met with stiff resistance from a number of Massachusetts communities . Several towns refused to choose commissioners to assess the town population and estates , and officials from a number of them were consequently arrested and brought to Boston . Some were fined and released , while others were imprisoned until they promised to perform their duties . The leaders of Ipswich , who had been most vocal in their opposition to the law , were tried and convicted of misdemeanor offenses . 
 The other provinces did not resist the imposition of the new law , even though , at least in Rhode Island , the rates were higher than they had been under the previous colonial administration . Plymouth 's relatively poor landowners were hard hit because of the high rates on livestock , and funds derived from whaling , once sources of profit for the individual towns , were now directed to the dominion government . 
 = = = Town meeting laws = = = 
 One consequence of the tax protest was that Andros sought to restrict town meetings , since these were where that protest had begun . He therefore introduced a law that limited meetings to a single annual meeting , solely for the purpose of electing officials , and explicitly banning meetings at other times for any reason . This loss of local power was widely hated . Many protests were made that the town meeting and tax laws were violations of the Magna Carta , which guaranteed taxation by representatives of the people . It was noted that those who made these complaints had , during the colonial charter , excluded large numbers of voters through the requirement of church membership , and then taxed them . 
 = = = Land title reform = = = 
 Andros had been instructed to bring colonial land title practices more in line with those in England , and introduce quit @-@ rents as a means of raising colonial revenues . Titles previously issued in Massachusetts , New Hampshire , and Maine under the colonial administration often suffered from defects of form ( for example , lacking an imprint of the colonial seal ) , and most of them did not include a quit @-@ rent payment . Land grants in colonial Connecticut and Rhode Island had been made before either colony had a charter , and there were conflicting claims in a number of areas . 
 The manner in which Andros approached the issue was necessarily divisive , since it threatened any landowner whose title was in any way dubious . Some landowners went through the confirmation process , but many refused , since they did not want to face the possibility of losing their land , and they viewed the process as a thinly veiled land grab . The Puritans of Plymouth and Massachusetts , some of whom had extensive landholdings , were among the latter . Since all of the existing land titles in Massachusetts had been granted under the now @-@ vacated colonial charter , Andros essentially declared them to be void , and required landowners to recertify their ownership , paying fees to the dominion and becoming subject to the charging of a quit @-@ rent . 
 Andros attempted to compel the certification of ownership by issuing writs of intrusion , but large landowners who owned many parcels contested these individually , rather than <unk> all of their lands . 
 = = = Connecticut charter = = = 
 Since Andros ' commission included Connecticut , he asked Connecticut Governor Robert Treat to surrender the colonial charter not long after his arrival in Boston . Unlike Rhode Island , whose officials readily acceded to the dominion , Connecticut officials formally acknowledged Andros ' authority , but did little to assist him . They continued to run their government according to the charter , holding quarterly meetings of the legislature and electing colony @-@ wide officials , while Treat and Andros negotiated over the surrender of the charter . 
 In October 1687 Andros finally decided to travel to Connecticut to personally see to the matter . Accompanied by an honour guard , he arrived in Hartford on 31 October , and met that evening with the colonial leadership . According to legend , during this meeting the charter was laid out on the table for all to see . The lights in the room unexpectedly went out , and when relit , the charter had disappeared . The charter was said to have been hidden in a nearby oak tree ( referred to afterward as the Charter Oak ) so that a search of nearby buildings would not locate the document . 
 Whatever the truth of the account , Connecticut records show that its government formally surrendered its seals and ceased operation that day . Andros then traveled throughout the colony , making judicial and other appointments , before returning to Boston . On 29 December 1687 , the dominion council formally extended its laws over Connecticut , completing the assimilation of the New England colonies . 
 = = = Inclusion of New York and the Jerseys = = = 
 On 7 May 1688 , the provinces of New York , East Jersey , and West Jersey were added to the Dominion . Because they were remote from Boston , where Andros had his seat , New York and the Jerseys were run by Lieutenant Governor Francis Nicholson from New York City . Nicholson , an army captain and protégé of colonial secretary William Blathwayt , came to Boston in early 1687 as part of Andros ' honor guard , and had been promoted to his council . 
 During the summer of 1688 , Andros traveled first to New York , and then to the Jerseys , to establish his commission . Dominion governance of the Jerseys was complicated by the fact that the proprietors , whose charters had been revoked , had retained their property , and petitioned Andros for what were traditional manorial rights . The dominion period in the Jerseys was relatively uneventful , due to their distance from the power centers , and the unexpected end of the dominion in 1689 . 
 = = = Indian diplomacy = = = 
 In 1687 the governor of New France , the Marquis de Denonville , launched an attack against Seneca villages in what is now western New York . His objective was to disrupt trade between the English at Albany and the Iroquois confederation , to which the Seneca belonged , and to break the Covenant Chain , a peace Andros had negotiated in 1677 while he was governor of New York . New York Governor Thomas Dongan appealed for help , and King James ordered Andros to render assistance . James also entered into negotiations with Louis XIV of France , which resulted in an easing of tensions on the northwestern frontier . On New England 's northeastern frontier , however , the Abenaki harbored grievances against English settlers , and began an offensive in early 1688 . Andros made an expedition into Maine early in the year , in which he raided a number of Indian settlements . He also raided the trading outpost and home of Jean @-@ Vincent d 'Abbadie de Saint @-@ Castin on Penobscot Bay . His careful preservation of the Catholic Castin 's chapel would be a source of later accusations of " popery " against Andros . 
 When Andros took over the administration of New York in August 1688 , he met with the Iroquois at Albany to renew to covenant . In this meeting he annoyed the Iroquois by referring to them as " children " ( implying subservience to the English ) , rather than " brethren " ( implying equality ) . He returned to Boston amid further attacks on the New England frontier by Abenaki parties , who admitted that they were doing so in part because of French encouragement . 
 During Andros 's presence in New York , the situation in Maine had deteriorated again , as well , with English colonists raiding Indian villages and taking prisoners . These actions were taken in accordance with a directive issued by dominion councillors remaining in Boston , who ordered that frontier militia commanders were to take into custody any Abenaki suspected of participating in the raids . This directive sparked a problem in Maine , when twenty Abenaki , including women and children , were taken into custody by colonial militia . The local authorities were faced with the dilemma of housing the captives , shipping them first to Falmouth and then to Boston , angering other natives in the area , who seized English hostages to ensure the safe return of the captives . Andros castigated the <unk> for their unwarranted acts and ordered the Indians released and returned to Maine . A brief skirmish during the process of exchanging captives resulted in the deaths of four English hostages , and sparked discontent in Maine . Faced with this discord , Andros returned to Maine with a significant force , and began the construction of additional fortifications to protect the settlers . Andros spent the winter in Maine , and returned to Boston in March upon hearing rumors of revolution in England and discontent in Boston . 
 = = = Revolt = = = 
 On 18 April 1689 , soon after news reached Boston of the overthrow of James II of England , the colonists of Boston rose up against his rule . A well @-@ organized " mob " descended on the city , arresting dominion officials and Anglicans . Andros had his quarters in Fort Mary , a garrison house on the south side of the city , where a number of officials took refuge . The old Massachusetts colonial leadership , restored due to the rebellion and headed by ex @-@ governor Simon Bradstreet , then summoned Governor Andros to surrender , for his own safety because of the mob which they claimed " whereof we were wholly ignorant " . He refused , and instead tried to escape to the Rose , the sole element of the Royal Navy present near Boston at the time of the revolt . However , the boat sent from the Rose was intercepted by militia , and Andros was forced back into Fort Mary . Negotiations ensued , and Andros agreed to leave the fort to meet with the rebel council . Promised safe conduct , he was marched under guard to the townhouse where the council had assembled . There he was told that " they must & would have the Government in their own hands " , and that he was under arrest . He was taken to the home of dominion treasurer John Usher , and held under close watch . 
 After Fort Mary fell into rebel hands on the 19th , Andros was moved there from Usher 's house . He was confined there with Joseph Dudley and other dominion officials until 7 June , when he was transferred to Castle Island . It is during this period of captivity that he is said to have attempted an escape dressed in women 's clothing . The story , although it circulated widely , was disputed by the Anglican minister Robert Ratcliff , who claimed that story and others had " not the least foundation of Truth " , and that they were " falsehoods , and lies " propagated to " render the Governour odious to his people . " He did make a successful escape from Castle Island on 2 August , after his servant plied the sentries with drink . He managed to flee to Rhode Island , but was quickly recaptured and thereafter kept in virtual solitary confinement . He and others were held for 10 months before being sent to England for trial . The Massachusetts agents in London refused to sign the charges made against him , so the court summarily dismissed them , and freed him . When Andros was questioned about the various accusations that had been levelled against him , he pointed out that all of his actions had been taken to bring colonial laws into conformance with English law , or they were specifically taken in pursuit of his commission and instructions . 
 While Andros was in captivity , the New York government of Lieutenant Governor Francis Nicholson was simultaneously deposed by a military faction led by Jacob Leisler , in an event that came to be known as Leisler 's Rebellion . Leisler would govern New York until 1691 , when he was captured and executed by a force led by newly appointed provincial governor Henry Sloughter . Andros was eventually allowed to depart for England ; by that point , the Dominion of New England had effectively ceased to exist , with the colonies in the dominion having reverted to their previous forms of governance . Massachusetts and its surrounding territories were reorganized into the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691 . 
 = = Governor of Virginia = = 
 Andros was well received at court upon his return to England . The king in particular recalled that Andros had visited his court in the Netherlands , and expressed approval of Andros ' service . In search of employment , Andros offered his services as a spy , offering the idea of going to Paris , ostensibly to meet with the exiled James , but to actually attempt to acquire French military plans . This plan was rejected . While in England he married for the second time , to Elizabeth Crisp Clapham , in July 1691 . She was the widow of Christopher Clapham , who was connected by that marriage to his first wife 's family . 
 Andros ' next opportunity for employment came with the resignation in February 1692 of Lord Effingham as governor of the Province of Virginia . Although Francis Nicholson , formerly dominion lieutenant governor , was then serving as lieutenant governor or Virginia and sought the superior position , William awarded the governorship to Andros , and awarded Nicholson yet another lieutenant governorship , this time that of Maryland . This was destined to make Andros ' tenure more difficult , because his relationship with Nicholson had deteriorated for other reasons . The exact reasons for this enmity are unclear : one contemporary wrote that Nicholson " especially [ resented ] Sir Edmund Andros , against whom he has a particular pique on account of some earlier dealings " . 
 Andros arrived in Virginia on 13 September 1692 , and began his duties a week later . Nicholson graciously received him , and not long after sailed for England . Andros settled at Middle Plantation ( the future site of Williamsburg ) , where he would live until 1695 . He worked to organize the provincial records , the maintenance of which had suffered since Bacon 's Rebellion , and promoted the enforcement of laws designed to prevent slave rebellions . 
 He encouraged the diversification of Virginia 's economy , which was then almost entirely dependent on tobacco . The export @-@ oriented economy was also being badly hurt by the ongoing Nine Years ' War , because of which merchant ships were required to travel in convoys . For several years Virginia did not receive any military escorts , so their products were not going to market in Europe . Andros encouraged the introduction of new crops like cotton and flax , and the manufacture of fabric . 
 Virginia was the first colonial posting in which Andros had to work with a local assembly . His relationship with the House of Burgesses was generally cordial , but he encountered some resistance , especially to measures related to the war and colonial defenses . He hired armed vessels to patrol the colony 's waters and contributed financially to New York 's colonial defenses , which formed a bulwark against the possibility of French and Indian incursions into Virginia . In 1696 Andros was ordered by the king to send troops to New York , for which the burgesses reluctantly appropriated £ 1 @,@ 000 . Andros ' management of colonial defense and Indian relations were successful : Virginia , unlike New York and New England , was not attacked during the war . 
 During his tenure , Andros made an enemy of James Blair , a prominent Anglican minister . Blair was working to establish a new college for educating Anglican ministers , and he believed that Andros was not supportive of the idea . However , Blair and Nicholson worked closely together on this idea , with Nicholson often coming from Maryland for meetings on the subject . The two men were united in their dislike of Andros , and their activities helped to cause Andros ' resignation . The College of William and Mary was founded in 1693 . Despite Blair 's claims that Andros was unsupportive , Andros donated the cost of the bricks to construct the college 's chapel from his own funds , and convinced the House of Burgesses to approve funding of £ 100 per year for the college . 
 Blair 's complaints , many of them vague and inaccurate , made their way to London , where proceedings into Andros ' conduct began at the Board of Trade and the ecclesiastical courts of the Church of England in 1697 . Andros had lost most of his support on the Board of Trade when a Whig faction came to power , and his advocates were unable to sway the board in favor of him . Anglican bishops staunchly supported Blair and Nicholson . In March 1698 Andros , complaining of fatigue and illness , asked to be recalled . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Andros ' recall was announced in London in May 1698 ; he was replaced by Nicholson . He returned to England , and resumed his post as bailiff of Guernsey . He divided his time between Guernsey and London , where he had a house in Denmark Hill . His second wife died in 1703 , and he married for the third time in 1707 , to Elizabeth <unk> . In 1704 Queen Anne named him lieutenant governor of Guernsey , a post he held until 1708 . He died in London on 24 February 1714 and was buried at St Anne 's Church , Soho . His wife died in 1717 and was buried nearby . The church was destroyed during the Second World War , and there is no longer any trace of their graves . He had no issue by any of his wives . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Andros remains a notorious figure in New England , especially in Connecticut . Connecticut officially excludes him from its list of colonial governors , but his portrait hangs in the Hall of Governors in the State Museum across from the State Capitol in Hartford . Although he was disliked in the colonies , he was recognized in England as an effective administrator , implementing the policies that he had been ordered to carry out and advancing the crown 's agenda . Biographer Mary Lou Lustig notes that he was " an accomplished statesman , a brave soldier , a polished courtier , and a devoted servant " , but that his style was often " autocratic , arbitrary , and dictatorial " , that he lacked tact , and that he had difficulty reaching compromises . 
 Similarly , Andros was featured as an antagonist in the 1879 novel Captain Nelson , described as a " romance of colonial days " . 
 Andros appears in several episodes of The Witch of Blackbird Pond , where his conflict with the Connecticut colonists forms the background to the protagonist 's more personal problems . It is believed that Andros Island in the Bahamas was named for him . Early proprietors of the Bahamas included members of his first wife 's family , the Cravens . 
 = Trevor Philips = 
 Trevor Philips is a fictional character and one of the three lead protagonists of Grand Theft Auto V , a video game in the Grand Theft Auto series made by Rockstar Games . He appears as one of the three main protagonists , alongside Michael De Santa and Franklin Clinton . He is played by actor Steven Ogg , who provided the voice and motion capture for the character . 
 Rockstar based Trevor 's appearance on Ogg 's physical appearance , while his personality was inspired by Charles Bronson . Grand Theft Auto V co @-@ writer Dan Houser described Trevor as purely driven by desire and resentment . To make players care for the character , the designers gave the character more emotions . Trevor is shown to truly care about people very close to him , despite his psychopathic actions . 
 Trevor is considered one of the most controversial characters in video game history . Although the general attention given to Trevor by critics and gamers was mostly very positive , he has been criticised by many critics and players because of his violent personality and actions , but has also been praised for fitting in the world of the game . His design and personality have drawn comparisons to other influential video game and film characters . Many reviewers have called Trevor a likeable and believable character , and felt that he is one of the few protagonists in the Grand Theft Auto series that would willingly execute popular player actions , such as murder and violence . 
 = = Character design = = 
 Grand Theft Auto V co @-@ writer Dan Houser explained that Trevor " appeared to [ Rockstar ] pretty much out of nowhere as the embodiment of another side of criminality [ ... ] If Michael was meant to be the idea of some version of criminal control [ ... ] what about the guy who didn 't do that ? " He later described Trevor as " the person who 's driven purely by desire , resentment , no thought for tomorrow whatsoever , completely id rather than ego @-@ driven . " He stated that Trevor " kills without remorse , like a true psychopath , but very sentimental for the right reasons when it suits him . " 
 Rockstar drew upon game protagonist archetypes during the scripting the characters ; Trevor was considered to embody insanity . Houser said the team characterised Michael and Trevor as juxtapositions of each other . He said , " Michael is like the criminal who wants to compartmentalise and be a good guy some of the time and Trevor is the maniac who isn 't a hypocrite " . He said that having three lead characters would help move the game 's plot into more original territory than its predecessors , which traditionally followed a single protagonist rising through the ranks of a criminal underworld . In Grand Theft Auto V , Steven Ogg portrayed Trevor . During the initial audition process , Ogg noticed an on @-@ set chemistry between him and Ned Luke ( who portrayed Michael ) , which he felt helped secure them the roles . Ogg said , " When [ Luke ] and I went in the room together we immediately had something " . While the actors knew their auditions were for Rockstar Games , it was when they signed contracts that they learned they would be involved in a Grand Theft Auto title . Ogg felt Trevor 's characterisation had evolved over time . He said , " <unk> and character traits that began to appear — his walk , his manner of speech , his reactions , definitely informed his development throughout the game " . 
 The actors began working on the game in 2010 . Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology . Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios . Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on @-@ set , they considered their performances were no different from those of film or television roles . Their dialogue was scripted so that it did not allow the actors to ad @-@ lib ; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with approval from the directors . 
 = = Attributes = = 
 Trevor is depicted as a sociopath in Grand Theft Auto V. He is relentless and easily kills without remorse . However , he is honest about everything and rarely shows hypocrisy , which he often points out in others . He appears to be very insecure about being born in Canada , and takes offence to people mocking his accent . Despite his sociopathic actions , Trevor is very emotional ; he seems to care about people very close to him , and he can be truly loyal to them . These people include his mother , Ashley Butler , Patricia Madrazo , Maude , Michael De Santa and his children Tracey and Jimmy , Lamar Davis , Ron , Lester , Wade and Franklin Clinton . Nevertheless , the other characters regard Trevor as dangerously unstable ; during the prologue , Michael leads Trevor into a trap where he is supposed to be shot and killed , and later implores Franklin to plead insanity if he is ever arrested with Trevor . It is implied that the knowledge and extent of Trevor 's crimes , the belief that Trevor 's depravity escalated without anyone to keep him in check and his silence on the matter all weigh heavily on Michael 's conscience . 
 When portraying Trevor , Ogg cites Tom Hardy 's depiction of English criminal Charles Bronson in the 2008 biopic Bronson as a strong stylistic influence on his portrayal of Trevor . Ogg reflected that while Trevor embodies the violent , psychopathic Grand Theft Auto anti @-@ hero archetype , he wanted players to sympathise with Trevor 's story . " To elicit other emotions was tough , and it was the biggest challenge and it 's something that meant a lot to me , " Ogg said .

 Trevor is Canadian , born just north of the border of the United States . He grew up with a physically abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother . Trevor had a brother , Ryan , who died prior to the game 's events . Trevor 's father abandoned him in a shopping mall , which Trevor burnt down in retaliation . This upbringing combined with Trevor 's violent temper led Trevor to be severely unhinged , leading to numerous fights at school , including an assault on a teacher . Trevor loved planes , and at some point entered the military as a pilot , but was quickly forced to leave after being reproved in a psychological evaluation . Later on , Trevor committed crimes , the first one being a small robbery that landed him in jail for six months . He would continue his criminal ways , including using his piloting skills to become a smuggler . Trevor eventually met Michael Townley and both men realised that they wanted to earn money by performing large heists , and both men became successful in doing so . However , their partnership began to strain after Michael married a stripper named Amanda and started a family with her . 
 During one of their heists with their mutual accomplice Brad Snider , Michael and Brad are shot by police while Trevor escapes , and he believes Michael died and Brad was sent to jail . Trevor eventually settles in Sandy Shores , Blaine County , where he establishes a small criminal enterprise that he dubs " Trevor Philips Industries " that smuggles weapons and manufactures methamphetamine , which he hopes will grow into a large empire . Due to raging abandonment issues , Trevor surrounds himself with two loyal friends that he kidnapped and brainwashed from their previous lives named " Nervous " Ron <unk> and Wade Hebert . Trevor also enters an uneasy truce with his competitors in Sandy Shores , including The Lost Motorcycle Club led by Johnny <unk> , the <unk> Los Aztecas gang , and the O 'Neil Brothers . 
 Nine years after the fateful heist , Trevor finds out that Michael faked his death , and is so spooked and enraged that he breaks the truce and kills most of his competition in one burst of violence , a deadly streak that continues when a potential game @-@ changing deal with the Triads falls through . He drives to Los Santos , taking over the apartment and ruining the life of Wade 's cousin Floyd , and reunites with Michael , who now took on the name " De Santa " . After Michael introduces Trevor to Franklin Clinton , the two perform heists again , this time including Franklin . Trevor is determined to rob anything guarded by Merryweather Security Consulting , a private security firm that he dislikes , but he often fails . After not getting paid for a job , Trevor kidnaps Patricia , the wife of kingpin Martin Madrazo . Due to her kind maternal nature and his own abandonment issues , Trevor falls in love with her and only returns her after much demanding from Michael . However , the two stay in contact until the end of the game . 
 Trevor eventually discovers that Michael set him and Brad up , and that Brad is not in jail but buried in Michael 's fake grave . This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael , but needing him alive for one last heist . When that heist is successful , Trevor is so pleased that he lifts the death vow but still hates Michael . Near the end of the game , Franklin is given a choice : kill Trevor , kill Michael , or let them live and face their enemies . If the latter is chosen , Trevor kills Haines , before capturing Weston , and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin . Trevor once again considers Michael his friend , albeit a friend that he hates , which Michael accepts . If the second option is chosen , Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael 's death . If the first option is chosen , Franklin meets up with Trevor , before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant . When Trevor crashes into an oil tank , causing himself to be covered in oil , either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil , setting Trevor alight and killing him . If Trevor and Michael are spared , they continue to spend time together with Franklin , during which Trevor eventually admits that he over @-@ reacted after learning the truth about Brad , and refers to himself and Michael as friends .

 Trevor appears as a main character in Grand Theft Auto Online , the online multiplayer mode of Grand Theft Auto V. He provides missions to the player character once they reach Rank 13 ; after the player steals Trevor 's rolling meth lab , Trevor demands that they are to complete jobs for him to settle the issue . The jobs that Trevor demands generally consist of stealing drugs from rival groups , specifically the Lost Motorcycle Club , while killing the dealers .

 Trevor 's character was met with generally positive feedback following the release of Grand Theft Auto V. Edge singled out Trevor as the stand @-@ out of the three protagonists , which they owed to his volatile personality . Like Edge , Caroline Petit of GameSpot considered Trevor " a truly horrible , terrifying , psychotic human being — and a terrific character . " Eurogamer 's Tom Bramwell , however , felt that Trevor undermined the other characters because he was a " shallow and unconvincing " sensationalised anti @-@ hero , and that " his antics derail [ ed ] the narrative " and overshadowed the character development of Michael and Franklin . Xav de Matos of Joystiq found all three characters unlikable to the extent that they had an alienating effect on the story , noting that " though each character has a valid motivation for his journey , it 's difficult to want them to succeed . " He also felt that the ambivalence between Trevor and Michael was a tired device by the conclusion of the story as it became a " seemingly endless cycle " of conflict between them . 
 Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar praised Trevor for being the first character in the series that " makes sense " . He stated that , upon their first playthrough of a Grand Theft Auto game , most players " carjacked some poor <unk> , then started doing <unk> on the sidewalk , mowing over civilians " , as opposed to playing peacefully . " Trevor 's existence isn 't a commentary on any group of people – he 's just the first logical fit to the way people have been playing GTA games for the past decade , " he said . Sullivan concluded that Trevor is one of the few protagonists in the Grand Theft Auto series that would willingly execute popular player actions , such as murder and violence . Trevor has been compared to many other characters in video games and films . Calvin Khan of IGN compared Trevor to Heath Ledger 's Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight . Khan felt that Trevor is the only character in Grand Theft Auto V not trying to fake his persona , stating " Trevor absolutely knows that he 's a monster but just doesn 't care . He enjoys causing misery and harm , lives for it and embraces it and – much like Heath Ledger 's Joker – he exists purely for unadulterated anarchy . " He also felt that Trevor 's only reasoning for hurting people and messing everything up around him is simply because it 's just too much fun not to . Khan concluded saying that it 's clear that the world through the eyes of Trevor is already royally broken and he sees no harm in messing it up some more , hence the reason for Trevor 's actions .

 The mission " By the Book " from Grand Theft Auto V was criticised for its depiction of torture . In the mission , Trevor interrogates a man named Ferdinand Kerimov ( called Mr. K ) for information about a suspected Azerbaijani fugitive who poses a threat to the FIB ( the game 's version of the FBI ) . Trevor uses torture equipment on the restrained man , which players select from a table . Once Mr. K provides the FIB with the information , Trevor is asked to kill him , but instead drives him to the airport , providing him an opportunity to escape . While driving Kerimov , Trevor monologues about the ineffectiveness of torture , pointing out Kerimov 's readiness to supply the FIB with the information without being tortured , and expressing that torture is used as a power play " to assert ourselves " . 
 Reviewers echoed that while the mission served as political commentary on the use of torture by the United States government , its use of torture was in poor taste . GameSpot 's Petit felt that placing the torture scene in context with the monologue created a hypocrisy in the mission 's function as a commentary device , and IGN 's MacDonald felt it " pushed the boundaries of taste " . In an editorial , Bramwell discussed whether the political commentary was overshadowed by the violent content , comparing the mission to Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 's " No Russian " controversy . He considered the sequence lacking enough context to justify its violence and summarised its function as " flawed " . Labour MP Keith Vaz expressed concern that underage players could be exposed to the mission . Keith Best of Freedom from Torture said the torturer role @-@ play " crossed a line " . Tom Chick defended the torture sequence , and wrote that unlike the " No Russian " mission or the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty , the underlying political commentary on torture in " By the Book " necessitated the violent content . 
 = Punctuated equilibrium = 
 Punctuated equilibrium ( also called punctuated equilibria ) is a theory in evolutionary biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record they will become stable , showing little net evolutionary change for most of their geological history . This state is called stasis . When significant evolutionary change occurs , the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called <unk> . <unk> is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species , rather than one species gradually transforming into another . 
 Punctuated equilibrium is commonly contrasted against phyletic gradualism , the belief that evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages ( called anagenesis ) . In this view , evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous . 
 In 1972 , paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould published a landmark paper developing their theory and called it punctuated equilibria . Their paper built upon Ernst Mayr 's model of geographic speciation , I. Michael Lerner 's theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis , as well as their own empirical research . Eldredge and Gould proposed that the degree of gradualism commonly attributed to Charles Darwin is virtually nonexistent in the fossil record , and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species . 
 = = History = = 
 Punctuated equilibrium originated as a logical extension of Ernst Mayr 's concept of genetic revolutions by allopatric and especially peripatric speciation as applied to the fossil record . Although some of the basic workings of the theory were proposed and identified by Mayr in 1954 , historians of science generally recognize the 1972 paper by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould as the foundation of the new <unk> research program . Punctuated equilibrium differs from Mayr 's theory mainly in that Eldredge and Gould placed considerably greater emphasis on stasis , whereas Mayr was generally concerned with explaining the morphological discontinuity ( or " sudden jumps " ) found in the fossil record . Mayr later complimented Eldredge and Gould 's paper , stating that evolutionary stasis had been " unexpected by most evolutionary biologists " and that punctuated equilibrium " had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology . " 
 A year before their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper , Niles Eldredge published a paper in the journal Evolution which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr 's standard mechanism of allopatric speciation might suggest a possible resolution . 
 The Eldredge and Gould paper was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America in 1971 . The symposium focused its attention on the possibility that modern <unk> studies could revitalize various aspects of paleontology and macroevolution . Tom Schopf , who organized that year 's meeting , assigned Gould the topic of speciation . Gould recalls that " Eldredge 's 1971 publication [ on Paleozoic trilobites ] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject — so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly . " According to Gould " the ideas came mostly from Niles , with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe . I coined the term punctuated equilibrium and wrote most of our 1972 paper , but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould . " In his book Time Frames Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair " each wrote roughly half . Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other — I remember for example , writing the section on Gould 's snails . Other parts are harder to reconstruct . Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency . We sent it in , and Schopf reacted strongly against it — thus signaling the tenor of the reaction it has engendered , though for shifting reasons , down to the present day . " 
 John Wilkins and Gareth Nelson have argued that French architect Pierre <unk> proposed an " anticipation of the theory of punctuated equilibrium of Gould and Eldredge . " 
 = = The fossil record = = 
 The fossil record of an evolutionary progression typically consists of species that suddenly appear , and ultimately disappear , in many cases close to a million years later , without any change in external appearance . Graphically , these fossil species are represented by horizontal lines , whose lengths depict how long each of them existed . The <unk> of the lines illustrates the unchanging appearance of each of the fossil species depicted on the graph . During each species ' existence new species appear at random intervals , each also lasting many hundreds of thousands of years before disappearing without a change in appearance . The exact relatedness of these concurrent species is generally impossible to determine . This is illustrated in the following diagram depicting the evolution of modern humans from the time that the <unk> separated from the line that led to the evolution of our closest living primate relatives , the chimpanzees . 
 For similar evolutionary time lines , showing the identical pattern of evolutionary change , see , for instance , the paleontological list of African dinosaurs , Asian dinosaurs , the <unk> and Amiiformes . ( Note the different time scales in these different diagrams . )

 When Eldredge and Gould published their 1972 paper , allopatric speciation was considered the " standard " model of speciation . This model was popularized by Ernst Mayr in his 1954 paper " Change of genetic environment and evolution , " and his classic volume Animal Species and Evolution ( 1963 ) . 
 Allopatric speciation suggests that species with large central populations are stabilized by their large volume and the process of gene flow . New and even beneficial mutations are diluted by the population 's large size and are unable to reach fixation , due to such factors as constantly changing environments . If this is the case , then the transformation of whole lineages should be rare , as the fossil record indicates . Smaller populations on the other hand , which are isolated from the parental stock , are decoupled from the homogenizing effects of gene flow . In addition , pressure from natural selection is especially intense , as peripheral isolated populations exist at the outer edges of ecological tolerance . If most evolution happens in these rare instances of allopatric speciation then evidence of gradual evolution in the fossil record should be rare . This hypothesis was alluded to by Mayr in the closing paragraph of his 1954 paper : 
 Rapidly evolving peripherally isolated populations may be the place of origin of many evolutionary novelties . Their isolation and comparatively small size may explain phenomena of rapid evolution and lack of documentation in the fossil record , hitherto puzzling to the palaeontologist . " 
 As time went on Gould moved away from wedding punctuated equilibrium to allopatric speciation , particularly as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation . Gould was particularly attracted to Douglas <unk> 's work on the importance of reproductive isolating mechanisms . 
 Other biologists have also applied punctuated equilibrium to non @-@ sexual species , including the evolution of viruses . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Before Eldredge and Gould alerted their colleagues to the prominence of stasis in the fossil record , most evolutionists considered stasis to be rare or unimportant . George Gaylord Simpson , for example , believed that phyletic gradual evolution ( called <unk> in his terminology ) comprised 90 % of evolution . However one meta @-@ analysis examining 58 published studies on speciation patterns in the fossil record showed that 71 % exhibited stasis , 63 % of which were also associated with punctuated patterns of evolutionary change . According to Michael Benton , " it seems clear then that stasis is common , and that had not been predicted from modern genetic studies . " 
 Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the putative causes of stasis . Gould was initially attracted to I. Michael Lerner 's theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis . However this hypothesis was rejected over time , as evidence accumulated against it . Other plausible mechanisms which have been suggested include : habitat tracking , stabilizing selection , the <unk> @-@ Maynard Smith stability hypothesis , constraints imposed by the nature of subdivided populations , normalizing clade selection , and <unk> . 
 Evidence for the existence of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of sibling species , species which are morphologically indistinguishable , but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have been separated for millions of years . A paramount example of evolutionary stasis is the fern Osmunda <unk> . Based on paleontological evidence it has remained unchanged , even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes , for at least 180 million years . 
 According to Gould , " stasis may emerge as the theory 's most important contribution to evolutionary science . " Philosopher Kim <unk> adds , " In claiming that species typically undergo no further evolutionary change once speciation is complete , they are not claiming that there is no change at all between one generation and the next . Lineages do change . But the change between generations does not accumulate . Instead , over time , the species wobbles about its phenotypic mean . Jonathan Weiner 's The Beak of the Finch describes this very process . " 
 The fossil record includes well documented examples of phyletic gradualism and punctuational evolution . As such , much debate persists over the prominence of stasis in the fossil record .

 Punctuated equilibrium has also been cited as contributing to the hypothesis that species are Darwinian individuals , and not just classes , thereby providing a stronger framework for a hierarchical theory of evolution .

 Much confusion has arisen over what proponents of punctuated equilibrium actually argued , what mechanisms they advocated , how fast the punctuations were , what taxonomic scale their theory applied to , how revolutionary their claims were intended to be , and how punctuated equilibrium related to other ideas like quantum evolution , saltationism , and mass extinction . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The punctuational nature of punctuated equilibrium has engendered perhaps the most confusion over Eldredge and Gould 's theory . Gould 's sympathetic treatment of Richard Goldschmidt , the controversial geneticist who advocated the idea of " hopeful monsters , " led some biologists to conclude that Gould 's punctuations were occurring in single @-@ generation jumps . This interpretation has frequently been exploited by creationists to <unk> the weakness of the paleontological record , and to portray contemporary evolutionary biology as advancing neo @-@ saltationism . In an often quoted remark , Gould stated , " Since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends , it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists — whether through design or stupidity , I do not know — as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms . Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level , but they are abundant between larger groups . " Although there exist some debate over how long the punctuations last , supporters of punctuated equilibrium generally place the figure between 50 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 years .
