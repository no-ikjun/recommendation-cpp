 Mating starts in late autumn and continues to the end of winter . Little is known about mating behaviour or breeding grounds . In the fall , males will follow females for prolonged periods of time . Occasionally , a second male will attempt to displace the first , and the whales will race each other at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour ( 32 km / h ) . This often causes the racing whales to breach , which is rare in blue whales . This racing behavior may even escalate to physical violence between the males . Scientists have observed this behavior in multiple parts of the world , including the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada and the South Taranaki Bight in New Zealand . 
 Females typically give birth once every two to three years at the start of the winter after a gestation period of 10 to 12 months . The calf weighs about 2 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 2 @.@ 8 short tons ) and is around 7 metres ( 23 ft ) in length . Blue whale calves drink 380 – 570 litres ( 100 – 150 U.S. gallons ) of milk a day . Blue whale milk has an energy content of about 18 @,@ 300 kJ / kg ( 4 @,@ 370 kcal / kg ) . The calf is weaned after six months , by which time it has doubled in length . The first video of a calf thought to be nursing was made 5 February 2016 . 
 Sexual maturity is typically reached at five to ten years of age . In the Northern Hemisphere , whaling records show that males averaged 20 – 21 m ( 66 – 69 ft ) and females 21 – 23 m ( 69 – 75 ft ) at sexual maturity , while in the Southern Hemisphere it was 22 @.@ 6 and 24 m ( 74 and 79 ft ) , respectively . In the Northern Hemisphere , as adults , males averaged 24 m ( 79 ft ) and females 25 m ( 82 ft ) with average calculated weights of 90 @.@ 5 and 101 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 100 and 112 tons ) , respectively . Blue whales in the eastern North Pacific population were found to be on average 0 @.@ 91 meters ( 3 ft ) shorter , therefore with males averaging 23 @.@ 3 meters ( 76 ft ) and 80 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 88 @.@ 5 tons ) and females 24 meters ( 79 ft ) and 90 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 100 tons ) . Antarctic males averaged 25 m ( 82 ft ) and females 26 @.@ 2 m ( 86 ft ) , averaging 101 @.@ 5 and 118 tonnes ( 112 and 130 tons ) . Pygmy blue whales average 19 @.@ 2 meters ( 63 feet ) at sexual maturity , with males averaging 21 meters and females 22 meters ( 69 and 72 feet ) when fully grown , averaging 76 and 90 tonnes ( 83 @.@ 5 and 99 tons ) . 
 In the eastern North Pacific , photogrammetric studies have shown sexually mature ( but not necessarily fully grown ) blue whales today average 21 @.@ 7 m ( 71 ft ) , and about 65 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 72 tons ) with the largest found being about 24 @.@ 5 m ( 80 @.@ 5 ft ) – although a 26 @.@ 5 m ( 87 ft ) female stranded near Pescadero , California in 1979 . 
 Antarctic blue whales gain 50 % of their lean body weight in the summer feeding season , i.e. a blue whale entering the Antarctic weighing 100 tons would leave weighing 150 tons . The fattened weight is 120 % the average weight and the lean weight is 80 % . 
 Scientists estimate that blue whales can live for at least 80 years , but since individual records do not date back into the whaling era , this will not be known with certainty for many years . The longest recorded study of a single individual is 34 years , in the eastern North Pacific . 
 The whales ' only natural predator is the orca . Studies report that as many as 25 % of mature blue whales have scars resulting from orca attacks . The mortality rate of such attacks is unknown . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Blue whale strandings are extremely uncommon , and , because of the species ' social structure , mass strandings are unheard of . When strandings do occur , they can become the focus of public interest . In 1920 , a blue whale washed up near <unk> on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland . It had been shot by whalers , but the harpoon had failed to explode . As with other mammals , the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs , even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning . Two of the whale 's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction . 
 In June 2015 , a female blue whale estimated at 12 @.@ 2 meters ( 40 feet ) and 20 tonnes ( 22 tons ) was stranded on a beach in Maharashtra , India , the first live stranding in the region . Despite efforts by the <unk> forest department and local fisherman , the whale died 10 hours after being stranded . In August 2009 , a wounded blue whale was stranded in a bay in <unk> , Iceland . The first rescue attempt failed , as the whale ( thought to be over 20 meters long ) towed the > 20 ton boat back to shore at speeds of up to 7 miles per hour ( 11 km / h ) . The whale was towed to sea after 7 hours by a stronger boat . It is unknown whether it survived . In December 2015 , a live blue whale thought to be over 20 metres ( 65 feet ) long was rescued from a beach in Chile . Another stranded blue whale , thought to be about 12 @.@ 2 metres ( 40 feet ) long , was rescued in India in February 2016 . Boats were used in all successful cases . 
 = = = Vocalizations = = = 
 Estimates made by Cummings and Thompson ( 1971 ) suggest the source level of sounds made by blue whales are between 155 and 188 decibels when measured relative to a reference pressure of one micropascal at one metre . All blue whale groups make calls at a fundamental frequency between 10 and 40 Hz ; the lowest frequency sound a human can typically perceive is 20 Hz . Blue whale calls last between ten and thirty seconds . Blue whales off the coast of Sri Lanka have been repeatedly recorded making " songs " of four notes , lasting about two minutes each , reminiscent of the well @-@ known humpback whale songs . As this phenomenon has not been seen in any other populations , researchers believe it may be unique to the B. m. brevicauda ( pygmy ) subspecies . 
 The purpose of vocalization is unknown . Richardson et al . ( 1995 ) discuss six possible reasons : 
 Maintenance of inter @-@ individual distance 
 Species and individual recognition 
 Contextual information transmission ( for example feeding , alarm , courtship ) 
 Maintenance of social organization ( for example contact calls between females and males ) 
 Location of topographic features 
 Location of prey resources 
 = = Population and whaling = = 
 = = = Hunting era = = = 
 Blue whales are not easy to catch or kill . Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers , who instead targeted sperm and right whales . In 1864 , the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales . Although it was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate , Foyn perfected the harpoon gun , and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway . Because of disputes with the local fishermen , the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904 . 
 Soon , blue whales were being hunted off Iceland ( 1883 ) , the Faroe Islands ( 1894 ) , Newfoundland ( 1898 ) , and Spitsbergen ( 1903 ) . In 1904 – 05 the first blue whales were taken off South Georgia . By 1925 , with the advent of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam @-@ driven whale catchers , the catch of blue whales , and baleen whales as a whole , in the Antarctic and sub @-@ Antarctic began to increase dramatically . In the 1930 – 31 season , these ships caught 29 @,@ 400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone . By the end of World War II , populations had been significantly depleted , and , in 1946 , the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced , but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species . Rare species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative abundance . 
 Arthur C. Clarke , in his 1962 book Profiles of the Future , was the first prominent intellectual to call attention to the plight of the blue whale . He mentioned its large brain and said , " we do not know the true nature of the entity we are destroying . " 
 All of the historical coastal Asian groups were driven to near @-@ extinction in short order by Japanese industrial hunts . Those groups which once migrated along western Japan to the East China Sea were likely wiped out much earlier , as the last catches on Amami Oshima were between the 1910s and the 1930s , and the last known stranding records on the Japanese archipelago , excluding the Ryukyu Islands , were over a half @-@ century ago . Commercial catches were continued until 1965 and whaling stations targeting blues were mainly placed along the Hokkaido and Sanriku coasts . 
 Blue whale hunting was banned in 1966 by the International Whaling Commission , and illegal whaling by the Soviet Union finally halted in the 1970s , by which time 330 @,@ 000 blue whales had been caught in the Antarctic , 33 @,@ 000 in the rest of the Southern Hemisphere , 8 @,@ 200 in the North Pacific , and 7 @,@ 000 in the North Atlantic . The largest original population , in the Antarctic , had been reduced to a mere 360 individuals , about 0 @.@ 15 % of their initial numbers . 
 = = = Population and distribution today = = = 
 Since the introduction of the whaling ban , studies have examined whether the conservation reliant global blue whale population is increasing or remaining stable . In the Antarctic , best estimates show an increase of 7 @.@ 3 % per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling , but numbers remain at under 1 % of their original levels . Recovery varies regionally , however , and the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population ( historically a relatively small proportion of the global total ) has rebounded to about 2 @,@ 200 individuals , an estimated 97 % of its pre @-@ hunting population . 
 The total world population was estimated to be between 5 @,@ 000 and 12 @,@ 000 in 2002 , although there are high levels of uncertainty in available estimates for many areas . A more recent estimate by the IUCN puts the global population at 10 @,@ 000 – 25 @,@ 000 . 
 The IUCN Red List counts the blue whale as " endangered " , as it has since the list 's inception . In the United States , the National Marine Fisheries Service lists them as endangered under the Endangered Species Act . The largest known concentration , consisting of about 2 @,@ 800 individuals , is the northeast Pacific population of the northern blue whale ( B. m. musculus ) subspecies that ranges from Alaska to Costa Rica , but is most commonly seen from California in summer . Infrequently , this population visits the northwest Pacific between Kamchatka and the northern tip of Japan . 
 = = = = North Atlantic = = = = 
 In the North Atlantic , two stocks of B. m. musculus are recognised . The first is found off Greenland , Newfoundland , Nova Scotia and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence . This group is estimated to total about 500 . The second , more easterly group is spotted from the Azores in spring to Iceland in July and August ; it is presumed the whales follow the Mid @-@ Atlantic Ridge between the two volcanic islands . Beyond Iceland , blue whales have been spotted as far north as Spitsbergen and Jan Mayen , though such sightings are rare . Scientists do not know where these whales spend their winters . The total North Atlantic population is estimated to be between 600 and 1 @,@ 500 . Off Ireland , the first confirmed sightings were made in 2008 , since then Porcupine Seabight has been regarded as a prominent habitat for the species along with fin whales . 
 = = = = North Pacific = = = = 
 Five or more subpopulations have been suggested , and several of these mainly in western north Pacific have been considered either functionally or virtually extinct . Of the populations that once existed off coastal Japan , the last recorded confirmed stranding was in the 1910s . Today , call types suggest only two populations in the north Pacific . Some scientists regard that historical populations off Japan were driven to extinction by whaling activities , mostly from the <unk> Sea off Wakayama , in Gulf of Tosa , and in the Sea of Hyūga . Nowadays , possible vagrants from either eastern or offshore populations are observed on very rare occasions off Kushiro . There were also small , but constant catch records around the Korean Peninsula and in the coastal waters of the Sea of Japan although this species is normally considered not to frequent into marginal seas , such as the Sea of Okhotsk , on usual migrations . Whales were known to migrate further north to eastern Kamchatka , the Gulf of Anadyr , off Abashiri or southern Sea of Okhotsk , and the Commander Islands . Only three sightings were made between 1994 and 2004 in Russia and the last known occurrence in eastern Sea of Okhotsk was in 1948 . In addition , whales have not been confirmed in Commander Islands for over past 80 years . Historically , wintering grounds existed off the Hawaiian Archipelago , Northern Mariana Islands , Bonin Islands and Ryukyu Islands , Philippines , Taiwan , Zhoushan Archipelago , and South China Sea coasts such as in Daya Bay , Leizhou Peninsula , and Hainan Island , and further south to Paracel Islands . Archaeological records suggest Blue whales once migrated into Sea of Japan , coasts of Korean Peninsula and northwestern Kyushu , and to Yellow and Bohai Sea as well . During cetacean sighting visual surveys in Tsushima Strait conducted by Japanese Coast Guard , several gigantic whales measuring over 20m in length have been observed in recent years , however their exact identities are unclear . A stranding was recorded in <unk> in 2005 . Although the exact species is unclear , a large rorqual with small dorsal fin was observed in pelagic water of China or Taiwan in 2012 . For further status in Chinese and Korean waters , see Wildlife of China . 
 As of 2014 , the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population has rebounded to an estimated 2 @,@ 200 individuals , which is thought to be about 97 % of its pre @-@ whaling numbers . 
 = = = = Southern Hemisphere and vicinity to Northern Indian Ocean = = = = 
 In the Southern Hemisphere , there appear to be two distinct subspecies , B. m. intermedia , the Antarctic blue whale , and the little @-@ studied pygmy blue whale , B. m. brevicauda , found in Indian Ocean waters . The most recent surveys ( midpoint 1998 ) provided an estimate of 2 @,@ 280 blue whales in the Antarctic ( of which fewer than 1 % are likely to be pygmy blue whales ) . Estimates from a 1996 survey show that 424 pygmy blue whales were in a small area south of Madagascar alone , thus it is likely that numbers in the entire Indian Ocean are in the thousands . If this is true , the global numbers would be much higher than estimates predict . 
 Several congregating grounds are recently confirmed in Oceania , such as Perth Canyon off Rottnest Island , the Great Australian Bight off Portland , and in South Taranaki Bight . Southern blue and pygmy blue females use waters off Western Australia , and coastal areas of eastern North Island of New Zealand , from Northland waters such as the Bay of Islands and Hauraki Gulf to the Bay of Plenty in the south , as breeding and calving grounds . Whales off southern and western Australia are known to migrate into tropical coastal waters in Indonesia , Philippines , and off East Timor . ( Animals in the Philippines may or may not originate from North Pacific populations or from a pygmy blue population in the northern Indian ocean as whales regularly appear off Bohol , north of the Equator . ) At least on occasions , whales also migrate through remote islands such as Cook Islands , and Chilean pelagic waters adjacent to Easter Island and Isla Salas y Gómez , where possibilities of undiscovered wintering grounds have been considered . Both true and pygmy blue whales are expected to migrate to Fiji . 
 Blue whales also migrate through western African waters such as off Angola and Mauritania , and at least whales around Iceland are known to migrate to Mauritania . 
 = = = = Subspecies ' distribution = = = = 
 A fourth subspecies , B. m. indica , was identified by Blyth in 1859 in the northern Indian Ocean , but is now thought to be the same subspecies as B. m. brevicauda , the pygmy blue whale . Records for Soviet catches seem to indicate that the female adult size is closer to that of the pygmy blue than B. m. musculus , although the populations of B. m. indica and B. m. brevicauda appear to be discrete , and the breeding seasons differ by almost six months . Along mainland Indian coasts , appearances of whales had been very scarce that excluding unconfirmed record ( s ) , the first blue whale since after the last stranding record in Maharashtra in 1914 , was sighted off <unk> along with several Bryde 's whales in May 2015 . 
 Migratory patterns of these subspecies are not well known . For example , pygmy blue whales have been recorded in the northern Indian Ocean ( Oman , Maldives and Sri Lanka ) , where they may form a distinct resident population . In addition , the population of blue whales occurring off Chile and Peru may also be a distinct subspecies . Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter , and occasionally , their vocalizations are heard off Peru , Western Australia , and in the northern Indian Ocean . In Chile , the Cetacean Conservation Center , with support from the Chilean Navy , is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of <unk> Island in the Gulf of Corcovado ( Chiloé National Park ) , where 326 blue whales were spotted in 2007 . In this regions , it is normal for blue whales to enter <unk> . Whales also reach southern Los Lagos , such as off Caleta Zorra , live along with other rorquals . 
 Efforts to calculate the blue whale population more accurately are supported by marine <unk> at Duke University , who maintain the Ocean Biogeographic Information System — Spatial Ecological Analysis of <unk> Populations ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , a collation of marine mammal sighting data from around 130 sources . 
 = = = Threats other than hunting = = = 
 Due to their enormous size , power and speed , adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators . There is one documented case in National Geographic Magazine of a blue whale being attacked by orcas off the Baja California Peninsula ; although the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack , the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably died as a result of them shortly after the attack . In March 2014 , a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale off of California , with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale 's tail fluke . The blue whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed . Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks . 
 Blue whales may be wounded , sometimes fatally , after colliding with ocean vessels , as well as becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear . Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California . In September 2007 , three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes . Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka , although scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south . The ever @-@ increasing amount of ocean noise , including sonar , drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales , which makes it harder for them to communicate . Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid @-@ frequency sonar is activated , even though the sonar frequency range ( 1 – 8 kHz ) far exceeds their sound production range ( 25 – 100 Hz ) . Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB ) chemicals within the whale 's body . 
 With global warming causing glaciers and permafrost to melt rapidly and allowing a large amount of fresh water to flow into the oceans , there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point , there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation . Considering the blue whale 's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature , a disruption in this circulation , which moves warm and cold water around the world , would be likely to have an effect on their migration . The whales summer in the cool , high latitudes , where they feed in krill @-@ abundant waters ; they winter in warmer , low latitudes , where they mate and give birth . 
 The change in ocean temperature would also affect the blue whale 's food supply . The warming trend and decreased salinity levels would cause a significant shift in krill location and abundance .

 The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach , California features a life @-@ size model of a mother blue whale with her calf suspended from the ceiling of its main hall . The Beaty Biodiversity Museum at the University of British Columbia , Canada , houses a display of a blue whale skeleton ( skull is cast replica ) directly on the main campus boulevard . A real skeleton of a blue whale at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa was also unveiled in May 2010 . 
 The Museum of Natural History in Gothenburg , Sweden contains the only stuffed blue whale in the world . There one can also find the skeleton of the whale mounted beside the whale . Two skeletons are held in Ukraine in Odessa and Kherson . 
 The Melbourne Museum and Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa both feature a skeleton of the pygmy blue whale . The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh , North Carolina features a mounted skeleton of a blue whale . 
 The South African Museum in Cape Town , South Africa , features a considerable hall devoted to whales and natural history known as the Whale Well . The centrepiece of the exhibit is a suspended mounted Blue Whale skeleton , gleaned from the carcass of a partially mature specimen which washed ashore in the mid 1980s . The skeleton 's jaw bones are mounted on the floor of Whale Well to permit visitors a direct contact with them , and to walk between them so as to appreciate the size of the animal . Other mounted skeletons include that of a Humpback Whale and a Right Whale , together with in @-@ scale composite models of other whales , dolphins and porpoises . 
 The Tokyo National Museum in Ueno Park displays a life @-@ sized model of a blue whale in the front . Several other institutions such as Tokai University and Taiji Whale Museum hold skeleton of skeleton model of Pygmy blue whales , while several churches and buildings in western Japan including Nagasaki Prefecture display jawbone of captured animals as a gate . 
 = = Whale @-@ watching = = 
 Blue whales may be encountered ( but rarely ) on whale @-@ watching cruises in the Gulf of Maine and are the main attractions along the north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and in the Saint Lawrence estuary . Blue whales can also be seen off Southern California , starting as early as March and April , with the peak between July and September . More whales have been observed close to shore along with fin whales . 
 In Chile , the <unk> project combines conservation measures for the population of blue whales feeding off Chiloé Island with whale watching and other ecotourism activities that bring economic benefits to the local people . Whale @-@ watching , principally blue whales , is also carried out south of Sri Lanka . Whales are widely seen along the coast of Chile and Peru near the coast , occasionally making mixed groups with fin , sei , and Bryde 's whales . 
 In Australia , pygmy blue and Antarctic blue whales have been observed from various tours in almost all the coastlines of the continent . Among these , tours with sightings likely the highest rate are on west coast such as in <unk> Bay and in southern bight off Portland . For later , special tours to observe pygmy blues by helicopters are organized . 
 In New Zealand , whales have been seen in many areas close to shore , most notably around the Northland coast , in the Hauraki Gulf and the Bay of Plenty , off South Taranaki Bight , in Cook Strait and off Kaikoura with remarkably increasing sighting trends in recent years with some whales started staying in the same area near the shore for several days . Similar approaches with Portland 's case to use helicopters was once attempted in South Taranaki Bight , but seemingly been cancelled according to considerations . 
 = SMS Beowulf = 
 SMS Beowulf was the second vessel of the six @-@ member Siegfried class of coastal defense ships ( Küstenpanzerschiffe ) built for the German Imperial Navy . Her sister ships were Siegfried , Frithjof , Heimdall , Hildebrand , and Hagen . Beowulf was built by the AG Weser shipyard between 1890 and 1892 , and was armed with a main battery of three 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns . She served in the German fleet throughout the 1890s and was rebuilt in 1900 - 1902 . She served in the VI Battle Squadron after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , but saw no action . Beowulf was demobilized in 1915 and used as a target ship for U @-@ boats thereafter . She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Beowulf was 79 meters ( 259 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 14 @.@ 90 m ( 48 @.@ 9 ft ) and a maximum draft of 5 @.@ 74 m ( 18 @.@ 8 ft ) . She displaced 3 @,@ 741 long tons ( 3 @,@ 801 t ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two vertical 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines . Steam for the engines was provided by four coal @-@ fired boilers . The ship 's propulsion system provided a top speed of 15 @.@ 1 kn ( 28 @.@ 0 km / h ; 17 @.@ 4 mph ) and a range of approximately 1 @,@ 490 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 760 km ; 1 @,@ 710 mi ) at 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Beowulf had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with three 24 cm K L / 35 guns mounted in three single gun turrets . Two were placed side by side forward , and the third was located aft of the main superstructure . They were supplied with a total of 204 rounds of ammunition . The ship was also equipped with eight 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 30 guns in single mounts . Beowulf also carried four 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes , all in swivel mounts on the deck . One was at the bow , another at the stern , and two amidships . The ship was protected by an armored belt that was 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) amidships , and an armored deck that was 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The conning tower had 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick sides . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Beowulf was laid down in 1890 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen . She was launched on 8 November 1890 , and completed on 1 April 1892 . Among the crew that commissioned the ship was the officer Franz von Hipper , who would go on to command the German battle fleet during World War I. Directly after her commissioning , she joined the I Division of the fleet for its annual training exercises , along with the three ironclads Baden , Bayern , and Württemberg . Beowulf remained on active service through the winter of 1892 - 1893 , when she and her sister ship Siegfried joined the elderly ironclads König Wilhelm and Deutschland for a winter training cruise in the Mediterranean Sea . 
 In 1893 , Beowulf again participated in the annual fleet maneuvers , this time alongside her recently @-@ commissioned sister Frithjof and several old ironclads . On the first set of maneuvers , Beowulf and the other capital ships performed as the hostile French fleet , which was " attacked " by torpedo boats in the North Sea . The second set of maneuvers took place in the Baltic Sea , and Beowulf and the ironclads again simulated a French fleet . In 1897 , Beowulf again participated in the annual summer maneuvers in the III Division , along with Siegfried and Hildebrand . Her other three sisters were assigned to the IV Division . Following her service in the 1899 summer maneuvers , Beowulf was placed in reserve , as the flagship of the reserve squadron in the North Sea . 
 Beowulf served on active duty with the fleet until 1900 , when she was taken into drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Danzig for an extensive reconstruction . The ship was lengthened to 86 @.@ 13 m ( 282 @.@ 6 ft ) , which increased displacement to 4 @,@ 320 t ( 4 @,@ 250 long tons ; 4 @,@ 760 short tons ) . Her old boilers were replaced with eight new Marine type boilers , and a second funnel was added . Her secondary battery was increased to ten 8 @.@ 8 cm guns , and the 35 cm torpedo tubes were replaced with three 45 cm ( 18 in ) tubes . Work was completed by 1902 . She then returned to service with the fleet , and in 1903 , was assigned to the II Division , along with three of her sister ships . 
 She remained in the fleet until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , when she was mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense , along with her sister ships . In May 1915 , Beowulf participated in a combined naval and ground assault on the port of Libau in the Baltic . The attack took place on 7 May , and consisted of Beowulf , the armored cruisers Prinz Adalbert , Roon , and Prinz Heinrich , and the light cruisers Augsburg , Thetis , and Lübeck . They were escorted by a number of destroyers , torpedo boats , and minesweepers . The IV Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet was detached from the North Sea to provide cover for the operation . The bombardment went as planned , though the destroyer V107 struck a mine in Libau 's harbor , which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship . German ground forces were successful in their assault however , and took the city . On 31 August 1915 , the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized , and Beowulf 's crew was transferred to other warships . She was then used as a target ship for U @-@ boats . Starting in 1918 , she was used as an icebreaker in the Baltic Sea . On 17 June 1919 , she was stricken from the naval register . She was sold to Norddeutscher Tiefbaugesellschaft in Berlin . Beowulf was broken up for scrap in 1921 in Danzig . 
 = Sera Monastery = 
 Sera Monastery ( Tibetan : <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> , Wylie : se ra dgon pa " Wild Roses Monastery " ; Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) is one of the " great three " Gelug university monasteries of Tibet , located 1 @.@ 25 miles ( 2 @.@ 01 km ) north of Lhasa and about 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) north of the Jokhang . The other two are Ganden Monastery and Drepung Monastery . The origin of its name is attributed to a fact that the site where the monastery was built was surrounded by wild roses in bloom . 
 The original Sera Monastery is responsible for some 19 hermitages , including four nunneries , which are all located in the foot hills north of Lhasa . 
 The Sera Monastery , as a complex of structures with the Great Assembly Hall and three colleges , was founded in 1419 by Jamchen Chojey of Sakya Yeshe of Zel <unk> ( 1355 – 1435 ) , a disciple of Je Tsongkhapa . 
 During the 1959 revolt in Lhasa , Sera monastery suffered severe damage , with its colleges destroyed and hundreds of monks killed . After the Dalai Lama took asylum in India , many of the monks of Sera who survived the attack moved to Bylakuppe in Mysore , India . After initial tribulations , they established a parallel Sera Monastery with Sera Me and Sera Je colleges and a Great Assembly Hall on similar lines to the original monastery , with help from the Government of India . There are now 3000 or more monks living in Sera , India and this community has also spread its missionary activities to several countries by establishing Dharma centres , propagating knowledge of Buddhism . 
 Sera Monastery in Tibet and its counterpart in Mysore , India are noted for their debate sessions .

 The original Sera Monastery is a complex of structures founded in 1419 by Jamchen Chojey Sakya Yeshe of Zel <unk> ( 1355 – 1435 ) , a disciple of Je Tsongkhapa . Prior to establishing this monastery , Tsongkhapa , assisted by his disciples , had set up hermitages at higher elevations above Sera Utsé Hermitage . 
 The Sera complex is divided into two sectors by pathways ; the eastern part contains the Great Assembly Hall and the dwellings and the western part has the well @-@ known three colleges : the Sera Je Dratsang , the Sera Me Dratsang ; and the Ngakpa Dratsang , all instituted by Tsongkhapa as monastic universities that catered to monks in the age range 8 @-@ 70 . All the structures within this complex formed a clockwise pilgrimage circuit , starting with the colleges ( in the order stated ) , followed by the hall , the dwelling units and finally ending at the hermitage of Tsongkhapa above the Great Assembly Hall . 
 The Jé and Mé colleges were established to train monks , over a 20 @-@ year programme of <unk> mtshan <unk> <unk> tshang ( philosophical knowledge ) , which concludes with a <unk> degree . The Ngakpa college , which predated the other two colleges , was exclusively devoted to the practice of tantric ritual . Before 1959 , the administration of each college comprised an abbot with council of ten lamas for each college . 
 Over the years , the monastery developed into a hermitage where about 6000 monks resided . The monastery was one of the finest locations in Tibet to witness the debate sessions , which were held according to a fixed schedule . The monastery belongs to the Gelug Order and was one of the largest in Lhasa . In 2008 , Sera had 550 monks in residence . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of the monastery is strongly connected to Master Lama Tsongkhapa ( 1357 – 1419 ) , the founder of the Gelukpa Order , the much venerated and highly learned guru in Buddhist scriptures . It was under his divine tutelage that his disciple Jetsun Kunkhen Lodroe Rinchen Senge established the Sera Jey Monastery complex in the early 15th century AD . <unk> Lodroe Rinchen Senge initially served as a teacher in the Drepung Monastery before he formed the Sera Jey . The religious legend narrated for how the site was chosen was a clairvoyant vision that Tsongkhapa had in which he saw the full text of Prajnaparamita 's 20 <unk> on Shunyata captioned in the sky . This psychic spell gave him a full insight into the <unk> ( Fundamentals of <unk> or Shunyata ) text . Further , he also perceived the " vision of a rain like " AA " characters descending from the sky " . It was only 12 years later that one of his pupils , Jamchen <unk> , fulfilled the prophecy of his guru by establishing the Sera Je as a seat of learning knowledge of the complete teachings and practices of the Mahayana tradition . 
 <unk> , the then King <unk> <unk> Gyaltsen supported the noble venture with required finances and also , in 1419 , performed the foundation laying ceremony for construction of the monastery . Further detailing with regard to the building development including installing sacred images / idols and other objects of worship were completed according to the supreme wishes of great Lama Tsongkhapa . The monastery soon came to be known as " the Seat of <unk> ling ( Mahayana Tradition ) " . Another version for the name ' Sera ' that came to be prefixed with ' Monastery ' was its location that was surrounded by raspberry shrubs called ' Sewa ' in Tibetan , that formed like a ' Rawa ' in Tibetan , meaning " Fence " . 
 = = = Post @-@ 1959 events = = = 
 The 14th Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 and sought asylum there . During the month of March of the same year the Sera Jey Monastery had been destroyed by bombardment , which resulted in death of hundreds of monks ( in 1959 , the count of monks living in Sera Jey was <unk> ) , apart from destruction of ancient texts and loss of innumerable , invaluable , ancient and antique works of art . Many of those who survived ( monks and common people ) this onslaught by the Chinese fled to India , under severe winter weather conditions , across the Himalayas . Following this mass exodus of people from Tibet ( including , a few hundred Sera Jey lamas , <unk> and monks ) , when they arrived in India , they were resettled at Bylakuppe near Mysore , Karnataka state among many other locations spread across the country , as one of the exclusive Tibetan establishments with ready assistance forthcoming from the Government of India . It was in 1970 that the group of 197 Sera Jey monks with 103 of Sera Mey monks established a special monastery within the resettlement of Bylakuppe as a counterpart of the Tibetan Sera Jey Monastery . As none of the monks of the <unk> Dratsang ( Tantric College ) had survived the invasion , only the Sera Mey College and Sera Jey College were re @-@ formed in India . The Bylakuppe Monastery now houses 5 @,@ 000 Buddhist monks comprising some migrants and many other Tibetans who were not born in their ancestral homeland . 
 With forest land allotted by the Government of India , two arms of the Sera Monastery , representing the migrant monks of the Tibetan Sera Je and Sera Me colleges were established ; 193 Sera je monks got 147 @.@ 75 acres ( 59 @.@ 79 ha ) and 107 monks of Sera Me got an allotment of the balance area . Further , 38 tenements were built with grants by the Government of India for the Monks to reside and pursue their vocation of monkshood coupled with tilling the surrounding allotted land for raising food crops for survival . Well established as an organised Monastery with dedicated efforts of the monks , an Assembly Prayer Hall that could accommodate 1500 monks was also completed in 1978 . This Monastery is now the nodal monastery , with its affiliation to several smaller monasteries spread across various regions in Tibet ; its popularity could be gauged by the 3000 or more monks living here now . Encouraged by this success and noting the pressure on existing infrastructure , an additional , much larger and an impressive Assembly hall ( measuring 23 @,@ 275 square feet ( 2 @,@ 162 @.@ 3 m2 ) , 31 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) high with 110 pillars ) has been built that can accommodate 3500 monks to assemble for prayers . With this development , Sera has now two facets , the original “ Tibetan Sera ” and the Bylakuppe “ New Sera ” of the “ Tibetan Diaspora ” with the counterpart Jé , Mé monasteries , with the Ngakpa college counterpart also added recently . The Sera @-@ India monk community of the Bylakuppe Monastery , has gone global with their missionary activity by establishing “ dharma centers ” in many parts the world , thus removing the cultural isolation of pre @-@ 1959 years in Tibet . 
 Sera , Tibet that housed more than 5 @,@ 000 monks in 1959 , though badly damaged following the invasion of Tibet and the 1959 Revolution , is still functional after restoration . In 2011 , according to local sources , there are about 300 monks . The reason for this decline is attributed to the 2008 Tibetan unrest .

 = = = Sera Je College = = = 
 Sera Je <unk> ( College ) or <unk> , the largest college in Sera complex , measured an area of 17 @,@ 000 square metres ( 180 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . It was initially a three storied building ; a fourth floor was added in the 18th century by strengthening the building with a total of 100 columns . It had a statue of the Hayagriva ( said to have been sculpted by Lodro Rinchen himself in gilded copper ) , also known popularly as Avalokiteśvara , which was considered the protective deity of the monastery . This wrathful deity was worshipped as <unk> of obstacles with healing powers . <unk> Yonten <unk> , worshipped this deity first and on divine injunction initiated his son <unk> , to follow this tradition . <unk> , with the blessings of Lama Tsongkhapa , institutionalised the name of Hayagriva or Tamdin <unk> as the supreme protector deity of the monastery .

 <unk> Khang is the hermitage located just behind the Great Assembly Hall ( on the hill slope of Sera <unk> ) . This is where Je Tsongkhapa meditated . The hermitage is accessed through a track where painted rock carvings of Tsongkhapa , Jamchen and Dharma Raja ( the protector ) are seen flanking the stepped approaches , along the route . A new building has been constructed in place of the old hermitage , which was destroyed during the Revolution .

 Sera Monastery that developed over the centuries into a renowned place of learning , which trained hundreds of scholars who attained name and fame in the Buddhist nations , has under its affiliation 19 hermitages , including four nunneries , which are all located in the foot hills above Lhasa . The nunneries established are the Chupzang Nunnery , the Garu Nunnery , the Negodong Nunnery and the Nenang Nunnery and a few nuns of some of these nunneries held protest marches against the Chinese rule , and as a result suffered incarnation and indignities .

 Pabonka Hermitage ( pha bong kha ri khrod ) , the largest and most important of the Sera hermitages is located about 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) northwest of Lhasa in the Nyang bran Valley on the slopes of Mount Parasol . 
 The site , which is over 1 @,@ 300 years old , dates back to Songtsän Gampo , the founder of the Tibetan Empire , and was amongst the first buildings built in the Lhasa area by him during the 7th century after settlement . Although originally the site of his castle or fort , the Tibetan Annals have revealed that Pabonka was converted into a monastery , possibly under the reign of the second great Buddhist king of Tibet <unk> Detsen . Detsen , along with Guru Rinpoche and the first seven monks of the new Tibetan Empire used to meditate at the hermitage and it became one of Tibet 's very earliest Buddhist monasteries , possibly even pre @-@ dating Jokhang . The original nine @-@ storied monastery was partially destroyed by King <unk> in 841 AD during his campaign to destroy monastic Buddhism ; it was rebuilt in the 11th century as a two @-@ storied structure that housed 200 monks . 
 Je Tsongkhapa ( 1357 – 1419 ) lived at the site as a hermit , and it eventually became a scholarly institution . The Fifth Dalai Lama was known to be fond of the monastery and funded the building of an upper floor for Pabonka . 
 Before 1959 , Pabonka was independent of Sera Monastery , and from 1960 to the mid @-@ 1980s it was controlled by the Chinese . It then came under the control of Sera , whose monks renovated it and are continuing its traditions . 
 This temple is noted for its many shrines , and its blue and carved gold mantra in the hallway , inscribed with words meaning , " Hail to the jewel in the lotus " . A number of stone relics were buried during the Cultural Revolution but when Sera monks restored the hermitage they excavated the relics and restored most of them . A central shrine , dating back 1300 years to Gampo , is located in the temple and depicts <unk> , <unk> and Chana Dorje , the so @-@ called " <unk> <unk> Trinity " from which the temple takes its name . Up the hill from the hermitage , past a group of chortens , is Palden Lhamo Cave , a cave known to have been a meditation chamber of <unk> Gampo himself and contains statues of himself , his two wives and a rock carving of Palden Lhamo , the protectress . 
 The hermitage notably has its own tradition of monthly and yearly ritual cycles . The most important of these yearly ritual events ( at least for the laity ) are the six @-@ day ( three sets of two @-@ day ) Avalokiteśvara fasting rituals that take place during the Tibetan New Year ( Losar ) celebrations , the sixteen @-@ day ( eight sets of two @-@ day ) Avalokiteśvara fasting rituals that take place during the fourth Tibetan month ( they attract many people from Lhasa and the surrounding districts ) , and a ritual and other events that take place during the “ Sixth @-@ Month Fourth @-@ Day ” pilgrimage . 
 = = = = Drakri Hermitage = = = = 
 Drakri Hermitage ( brag ri ri khrod ) , also known as Bari Hermitage ( <unk> ri ri khrod ) lies about three kilometres north and slightly east of downtown Lhasa . Drakri , believed to have been founded by the abbot of Pha bong kh in the 18th century , was used as a <unk> retreat by Klong <unk> bla ma ngag dbang blo bzang ( 1719 – 1794 ) , one of the most renowned scholars of the <unk> Regional House ( Lho pa khang tshan ) of the Jé College ( <unk> tshang byes ) . Drakri Hermitage had control over Garu Nunnery since its early history and supervised the training of the Garu nuns until 1959 . In 1959 , the monks of the hermitage were evicted and the hermitage was turned into the notorious <unk> Prison , which gained a reputation for being one of the most severe penal institutions run by the Chinese in Tibet . 
 In the 1980s a citizen of Lhasa re @-@ established the monastery under the Nyingma sect to remember his late physician mother . After receiving permission from the Lhasa municipal government , he began renovating the site , although a former official of the Bari Lama ’ s estate who had previously controlled the monastery initially objected to it being converted into Nyingma practice centre . Today the hermitage , still partly ruined , consists of five major sections ; a main temple compound around a central courtyard with a temple , kitchen , and some of the monks ’ living quarters , an extensive ruined terraced complex just south of the main temple which before 1959 served as the meeting rooms and the living quarters of the workers and business managers of the Drakri Lama ’ s estate , a building that had served as the living quarters for the eight fully ordained monks who formed the ritual core of the monastic community , a stable for <unk> , a yak @-@ cow hybrid and several huts . The main temple contains statues of Guru Rinpoche and several tantric deities and a three @-@ dimensional model of Guru Rinpoche 's celestial palace , the Glorious Copper @-@ Coloured Mountain ( <unk> <unk> dpal ri ) . Today there are four tantric priests residing in the main temple compound and two nuns living in huts to the southeast .

 The ruins of Jokpo Hermitage ( ’ jog po ri khrod ) is located in the far western end of the Nyang bran Valley . The former property of the Jokpo Lama ’ s estate before the Chinese invasion in 1959 , it originally served as the meditation retreat of a monk named ’ Jog po rin po che of the Sera Mé College . The monk was a great meditator and according to tradition , after he died , his body remained in a state of perpetual meditative <unk> and was kept inside the <unk> Regional House temple where the monks reported that his hair and nails continued to grow even after his death . Before the Chinese invasion his body was buried and decayed and when the regional house ( khang tshan ) was rebuilt in the 1980s , his bones were exhumed . These are today placed inside the altar 's clay statue in the regional house temple . 
 = = = = Keutsang Hermitage = = = = 
 Keutsang Hermitage ( Ke ’ u tshang ri khrod ) was a precariously perched cave hermitage inhabited by the great Tibetan guru Tsongkhapa . However , the original cave collapsed in a landslide . What is present now was rebuilt , adjoining the ruined Keutsang West Hermitage , at a safer location . As it exists now , Keutsang is located to the east of Sera on a hill side above Lhasa ’ s principal cemetery . Rakhadrak Hermitage is located below this hermitage , within a close distance . This hermitage is also part of the Sera Mountain Circumambulation Circuit ( se ra ’ i ri ’ khor ) that pilgrims undertake during the ‘ Sixth @-@ Month Fourth @-@ Day ( drug pa tshe bzhi ) ’ celebrations . The hermitage had smooth relationship with Sera all through its history so much so that every official monk of the hermitage enjoyed de facto status of a monk of the <unk> Regional House ( Har gdong khang tshan ) of the Jé College also . The monastery also observes all ritualistic practices . 
 Some special aspects of the temple complex are : the belief that Maitreya ( <unk> pa ) assures rebirth to those whose remains are brought to the cemetery below <unk> tshang and it is also believed that light rays are exchanged between the Maitreya image here and the Maitreya Chapel at the northern end of the <unk> in Lhasa . 
 During the 1959 Cultural Revolution , the present and the fifth Keutsang incarnation ( <unk> sku phreng lnga pa ) was incarcerated for a time and later he sought asylum in India in the 1980s . 
 The hermitage was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution . Rebuilding it was started by a former monk of the hermitage in 1991 and was completed by 1992 . The rebuilt hermitage now houses 25 monks .

 Khardo Hermitage ( Mkhar rdo ri khrod ) is a historical hermitage in the <unk> Valley , to the northeast of Lhasa and Sera monastery , which is named after the local deity ( <unk> bdag ) , known as Mkhar rdo <unk> <unk> . Its setting is in a charnel ground ideal to perform tantric rites . The hermitage known as the " abode of saints " is surrounded by mountains on three sides which are all assigned divine names such as the ‘ Soul Mountain of the Buddhas of the Five Families ( <unk> ba ’ i rigs lnga bla ri ) ' for a group of hills behind the monastery , ' Soul Mountain of <unk> ( Bde <unk> bla ri ) where hand implements and bone ornaments of the deity were found , and the ‘ Birth Deity Peak ( <unk> ba ’ i lha ri or ’ <unk> ’ fro ) ' for the hill to the left of the hermitage . A cave here is known by the name the ' Offering Place Cave ( Brag <unk> sa ) ' , ( a copy of the holy Scriptures ( <unk> ’ <unk> ) is said to have been found here ) . Several local legends are narrated in respect of the history of founding the hermitage by Bzod pa rgya mtsho who lived in a cave here under the direction of the local deity . It was established in 1706 . The hermitage , now in ruins , was originally built in three tiers ( one above the other ) : the lowest tier was the hermitage or the main compound , the middle tier was known as the Upper Residence ( <unk> khang gong ma ) and top tier was the Temple of the Sixteen Arhats ( Gnas <unk> lha khang ) . The Seventh Dalai Lama , who was a student , fully supported Bzod pa rgya mtsho to build the first temple ( Temple of the Sixteen Arhats ) and also a residence for himself to stay during his visits to the hermitage , which came to be known as the ' Upper Residence ' . The Dalai Lama 's reverence for his guru was so deep that when the Bzod pa rgya mtsho died , he even performed the last rites for him , got installed his funerary <unk> and statue . He also located the Incarnate Lama of his guru at ' Phan po ' near Lhasa . The second Bzod pa rgya mtsho also had excellent equation with the Eighth Dalai Lama , <unk> Gyatso ( Da lai bla ma sku phreng brgyad pa ’ jam dpal rgya mtsho ) . This power equation resulted in two more monasteries being built as satellite monasteries .

Panglung was attempted to be renovated in the 1990s , but met opposition from the local people because the site had always been associated with this controversial protector deity , so redevelopment was prevented . 
 = = = = <unk> Hermitage = = = = 
 <unk> Hermitage ( Phur bu lcog ri khrod ) is situated in the Lhasa suburb of Dog bde in the northern mountains at the north @-@ east corner of the Lhasa Valley . It is the last hermitage to be visited on the “ Sixth @-@ Month Fourth @-@ Day ” ( drug pa tshe bzhi ) pilgrimage circuit . Fairly fully rehabilitated , it is considered an attractive hermitage . The hills surrounding the monastery have been given name tags of the three protectors of the divine paradise namely the Avalokiteśvara , <unk> and <unk> . It is also identified with the six syllables divine mantra ( <unk> ) - " OM Mani Padme Hum " . 
 History of the hermitage is traced to the 9th century when Padmasambhava ( Padma ’ <unk> <unk> ) meditated here . The main cave where he did penance is known as the ‘ Cavern of <unk> Chongzhi ( Rdo <unk> <unk> zhi ’ i <unk> pa ) ’ . Over the centuries , the monastery has seen many leading lights of the Tibetan monastic order playing a role in its building , such as the Zhang ’ <unk> ba ’ i <unk> po <unk> brag pa ( 1123 – 1193 ) , female saint Ma <unk> lab <unk> , Sgrub khang <unk> legs rgya mtsho ’ s ( 1641 – 1713 ) , Ngawang Jampa ( Phur lcog sku phreng dang po ngag dbang byams pa , 1682 – 1762 ) and Pan chen blo bzang ye shes ( 1663 – 1737 ) . Royal family members like the Queen Tsering Trashi ( <unk> mo tshe ring <unk> <unk> ) and the Tibetan King Pho lha nas ( 1689 – 1747 ) also supported the activities of the hermitage . However , the most significant face of development occurred during the third Purchok incarnation Lozang <unk> Jampa Gyatso ( Phur lcog sku phreng <unk> pa blo bzang <unk> <unk> byams pa rgya mtsho ) who was teacher of the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas . 
 However , the Cultural Revolution of 1959 saw almost total destruction of the hermitage . Since 1984 , with approval of the local government , a reconstruction face was begun and the hermitage has been substantially restored now to its past glory .

 Sera <unk> Hermitage ( Se ra chos <unk> ri khrod ) was a tantric college ( <unk> <unk> <unk> tshang ) before the 1959 Cultural Revolution . Located close to Sera and facing south , it has a yellow retreat house which was built first for the Tsongkhapa . The interesting story of this house is that a local ' site @-@ spirit ' ( <unk> bdag ) used to visit Tsongkhapa through a narrow window in the house . Tsong kha pa ’ s mural image is seen here on the wall , which is credited with special powers as an “ image that speaks ” or known as speaking @-@ statue ( <unk> <unk> ma ) . It was Tsongkhapa 's favourite hermitage where he spent substantial time and composed his <unk> , the “ Great Commentary on the <unk> ( <unk> shes <unk> chen ) . He also taught here . It is also known as the hermitage where Tsongkhapa assigned his Tantric teachings to <unk> shes <unk> seng ge ( 1383 – 1445 ) , the founder of the Tantric Colleges .

 Sera Utsé Hermitage ( se ra <unk> <unk> ri khrod ) , meaning “ Sera Peak ” is located on the mountain directly behind Sera Monastery itself , which is about 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) north of the Jokhang , about a 1 ½ hours walk up the hill from the main complex of Sera . It is reputedly older than Sera Gompa . According to tradition , the site contained one of Tsongkhapa ’ s ( 1357 – 1419 ) meditation huts and Sgrub khang <unk> legs rgya mtsho ( 1641 – 1713 ) was reputed to have meditated here at end of the seventeenth or early eighteenth century . He was a distinguished meditator , who brought his knowledge of the philosophical tradition to Sera Utsé and attracted many students , amongst them included Phur lcog ngag dbang byams pa ( 1682 – 1762 ) , and Mkhar rdo <unk> pa rgya mtsho ( 1672 – 1749 ) . 
 Historically the monastery was of substantial size but following its destruction by the Chinese in 1959 it was drastically reduced and only a section rebuilt . Sera Utsé has a two @-@ storied chapel and monks ' quarters with magnificent views over the city of Lhasa . There is a protector shrine to <unk> and Shridevi .

 The hermitage is believed to have been founded by <unk> las rgya mtsho ( d . 1667 ) , who was the regent of Tibet from 1665 to his death . He was a student of the Fifth Dalai Lama and requested his permission to build a hermitage for eight to sixteen monks in the foothills above his native <unk> and invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to perform a “ site investigation ” ( sa <unk> ) to determine the most auspicious location on which to build the monastery . The Dalai Lama made the treasure ( <unk> ) discovery of the self @-@ arisen stone image of the Buddha that is still located in Chupzang ’ s lower temple . However , the initial hermitage fell into ruin and the official founding of the monastery is credited to <unk> las rgya mtsho 's nephew , Sde <unk> <unk> <unk> rgya mtsho , in around 1696 . 
 The hermitage belonged to <unk> ye shes rgya mtsho for sometime who built a four @-@ pillar temple with rear chapel and porticos at the site . It was later under the possession of <unk> chub chos ’ <unk> ( 1756 – 1838 ) and <unk> <unk> sku phreng <unk> pa blo bzang <unk> , who was a junior tutor to the living 14th Dalai Lama . 
 In 1921 , Pha bong kha bde chen <unk> po ( 1878 – 1941 ) stayed at <unk> and published his teachings through his most famous work , Liberation in Our Hands ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . 
 In the 1950s , the site began to be used as a religious retirement community by elderly <unk> , who constructed small huts in which they could live out the final years of their lives in intensive Buddhist practice . Nuns began to renovate the site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery , as it is seen today , in 1984 , and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley .

 = = Debates = = 
 Debates among monks on the Buddhist doctrines are integral to the learning process in the colleges in the Sera Monastery complex . This facilitates better comprehension of the Buddhist philosophy to attain higher levels of study . This exemplary debating tradition supplemented with gestures is said to be exclusive to this monastery , among the several other monasteries of Lhasa . Visitors also attend to witness these debates that are held as per a set schedule , every day in the ' Debating Courtyard ' of the monastery . 
 = = = Procedures and rules = = = 
 The debate among monks unfolds in the presence of their teachers , with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners . The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘ Hindu Orthodoxy ’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century . Such debates usually take place within the monastery ’ s precincts . The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate . The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone . The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined ; the questioner has to succinctly present his case ( all on Buddhism related topics ) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame . The finality of the debate is with specific answers like : “ I accept ( do ) , the reason is not established ( ta <unk> ) or there is no <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) ” . Many a time , the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender . If the defender does not reply within a time frame , an expression of derision is witnessed . In the Tibetan debating sessions , there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator . This leads to “ conflicting opinions of participants and listeners . ” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part , the outcome is , however , formally decided . 
 = = = Physical gestures = = = 
 Debates are punctuated with vigorous gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion . Each gesture has a meaning . The debater presents his case with subtlety , robed in a formal monk ’ s attire . Some of the gestures ( said to have symbolic value ) , made during the debates , generally subtle dramatic gestures are : clapping after each question ; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm ; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender ’ s arguments denoting his self @-@ assurance ; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender , the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender ; opponent 's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist ; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common ; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument . Each time a new question is asked , the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm . When a question is answered correctly , it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing the back of his right hand to his left palm . When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist . 
 = = = Schedule = = = 
 The tradition of conducting debates in the Gelukpa tradition was set in many monasteries of the Gelukpa sect , namely the Ganden Monastery , the Sera Monastery , the Drepung Monastery and the <unk> , not only in pre @-@ modern Tibet but also in other similar monasteries established in exile , such as in Sera , India . At each location in Tibet , the debates are held under eight debating schedules in a year , depending on the rituals and festivals observed during the whole year . Each daily session is held between eight breaks when students debate on issues of Buddhist scriptures and related subjects . In the Sera monastery , the debate alternated by rituals has a daily schedule ( with alterations to suit the climatic season ) of the Morning debate ( 7 AM to 10 AM ) , Noon debate ( 11 AM to 1 PM ) , Afternoon debate ( 2 PM to 4 PM ) and Night debate ( 8 @.@ 30 PM to 9 @.@ 30 PM ) . 
 = = Festivals = = 
 The monastery hosts an impressive festival , popularly known as the ‘ Sera <unk> Festival ’ , which is largely attended by monks and devotees . The festival is held some time in February as per the Gregorian calendar corresponding to specific date fixed by the monastery according to the Tibetan calendar . On the festival day , a Dorje Pestle is ceremoniously taken to the Potala Palace . The Dalai Lama offers prayers to the Buddha to bestow strength and blesses the Pestle . Thereafter , the pestle is briefly placed on the heads of the monks and disciples by the Khenpo ( president ) of the <unk> <unk> . 
 Another popular festival witnessed by visitors and locals is the Sho Dun Festival held in the month of August in the Gregorian calendar . The festival represents the symbolic Buddha @-@ Unfolding , where worship of the Buddha is the essential part .

 Afghanistan participated in the 2002 Asian Games held in Busan , South Korea , from September 29 to October 14 , 2002 . This marked Afghanistan 's return to international sporting events after the fall of the Taliban regime . The Afghan delegation consisted of 12 officials ( 11 men and one woman ) and 44 competitors ( 40 men and four women ) participating in seven different sports . The Afghanistan national football team played its first international match since the 1984 AFC Asian Cup qualification phase . An English teacher from Kabul , Roia Zamani , won a bronze medal in the 72 kg middleweight class of taekwondo without winning a single match . Zamani was the only medalist from the Afghan side and the first Afghan medalist in 20 years . None of the remaining athletes advanced past the qualifying stages , and as such did not win any medals . 
 = = Background = = 
 Afghanistan is a member of the South Asian zone of the Olympic Council of Asia , and has competed in the Asian Games since the inaugural edition of the Games in 1951 in New Delhi . On September 26 , 1996 , the Taliban annexed the Kabul and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan . Under the Taliban regime all types of sporting activities were deprecated , as according to the Taliban , most of them were against the teachings of Islam and Islamic law . Many stadiums , like Ghazi Stadium of Kabul , were either destroyed or converted into venues for public executions and punishments . Women were banned from taking part in any type of sport ; male athletes were allowed to participate in a few sports , but were forced to wear long sleeves , trousers and beards . Following such incidents and discrimination against women , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) banned Afghanistan National Olympic Committee and barred them from taking part in the Olympic Games . 
 A few months before the 2000 Summer Olympics , the IOC offered the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee the opportunity to send a contingent to the Games without the Taliban flag . The Committee declined to take part on this condition . 
 Afghanistan did not send any delegation to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok , Thailand , due to economic difficulties . Laws implemented by the Taliban government also made it impossible for Afghan athletes to compete . For example , the International Boxing Association ( AIBA ) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches , but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their facial hair . Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games after the fall of the Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war . In June 2003 , the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague .

 = John Floyd ( Virginia politician ) = 
 John Floyd ( April 24 , 1783 – August 17 , 1837 ) was a Virginia politician and soldier . He represented Virginia in the United States House of Representatives and later served as the 25th Governor of Virginia . 
 During his career in the House of Representatives , Floyd was an advocate of settling the Oregon Country , unsuccessfully arguing on its behalf from 1820 until he left Congress in 1829 ; the area did not become a territory of the United States until 1848 . 
 In 1832 , Floyd received votes for the Presidency of the United States , running in the <unk> Party . He carried South Carolina and its 11 electoral votes . While governor of Virginia , the Nat Turner slave rebellion occurred and Floyd initially supported emancipation of slavery , but eventually went with the majority . His term as governor saw economic prosperity for the state . 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 Floyd was born at <unk> Station , Virginia , near what is now Louisville , Kentucky . His parents were pioneer John Floyd , who was killed by Native Americans twelve days before his son 's birth , and Jane Buchanan . His first cousin was Charles Floyd , the only member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition to die . In a letter dated 15 December 1830 , Sam Houston stated that Floyd was the first cousin of another Lewis and Clark Explorer , Nathaniel Pryor . 
 Floyd was educated at home and at a nearby log schoolhouse before enrolling in Dickinson College in Carlisle , Pennsylvania at the age of thirteen . He became a member of the Union Philosophical Society in 1797 . Although he matriculated with the class of 1798 , he had to withdraw due to financial troubles . His guardian had failed in his payments and family accounts relate Floyd was so poor that " he was obliged to borrow a pair of <unk> from a boatman " to return to his home in Kentucky . 
 When his step @-@ father , Alexander Breckinridge , died in 1801 , he was able to return , but had to withdraw again due to a lung illness . He moved to Philadelphia and was placed under the care of Dr. Benjamin Rush , an experience that influenced his decision to pursue a medical career . After an apprenticeship in Louisville , Kentucky , Floyd enrolled in the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1804 and became an honorary member of the Philadelphia Medical Society and a member of the Philadelphia Medical Lyceum . Floyd was graduated in 1806 and his graduating dissertation was entitled An Enquiry into the Medical Properties of the Magnolia <unk> and Magnolia <unk> . He moved to Lexington , Virginia and then to the town of <unk> , Virginia . Floyd also served as a Justice of the Peace in 1807 . 
 In 1804 Floyd married Letitia Preston , who came from a prominent southwest Virginian family . She was the daughter of William Preston and Susannah Smith , and sister of Francis Preston , of Abingdon , Washington County Virginia . They had 12 children , including : 
 John Buchanan Floyd , ( 1806 – 1863 ) , Governor of Virginia , and Secretary of War under President Buchanan . 
 Nicketti Buchanan Floyd , married United States Senator John Warfield Johnston . 
 George Rogers Clark Floyd , Secretary of Wisconsin Territory and later a member of the West Virginia Legislature 
 Eliza <unk> Floyd , married professor George Frederick Holmes 
 Floyd was a surgeon with the rank of major in the Virginia State Militia from 1807 to 1812 . At the outbreak of the War of 1812 , Floyd moved his family to a new home near present @-@ day Virginia Tech to be near friends and entered the regular army . On July 13 , 1813 , he was appointed surgeon of Lt. Col. James McDowell 's Flying Camp in the Virginia militia . When he returned from a leave of absence , he discovered someone else had been appointed to replace him , and so his service in this role ended on November 16 , 1813 . Floyd was then commissioned as major of the militia on April 20 , 1814 and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general of the 17th Brigade of Virginia militia . He served until he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1814 . During this time , he moved his family again , this time to Thorn Spring , a large plantation in Montgomery County , Virginia . Thornspring ( Pulaski ) ( Thornspring Golf Course ) was inherited by Letitia Preston Floyd from her father William Preston and was located near her older brother , Virginia Treasurer , Gen John Preston , and his Horseshoe Bottoms Plantation ( Radford Army Ammunition Plant ) . They both were near the <unk> Smithfield home ( Virginia Tech ) that their father had completed in Montgomery county for their mother , Susannah Smith Preston , before he died . John Floyd used to keep Bears chained to the tree on the lawns of the Thornspring Plantation ( Pulaski , VA ) . 
 = = Political career = = 
 From 1814 to 1815 , Floyd was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and established a record as a strong nationalist . He supported a joint resolution to coordinate Virginia 's defense with the Federal government as opposed to the contending resolution to " authorize the governor to ' communicate ' with the ' Government of the United States ' " . In addition , Floyd supported a bill that authorized Virginia to raise troops and place them at the order of the federal government , as well as supporting a resolution to condemn the terms of peace proposed by the British commissioners at Ghent . He was also an opponent of the tactics of the Federalist leader , Charles F. Mercer , who questioned whether the United States was a sovereign country . 
 In 1816 , Floyd was elected as a Democratic @-@ Republican to the United States House of Representatives , and served from March 4 , 1817 to March 3 , 1829 . When Henry Clay 's proposition to send a minister to Buenos Aires and therefore recognize Argentina in its bid for independence from Spain , Floyd was in support and urged recognition as a matter of national self @-@ interest and justice . As Floyd 's biographer noted : 
 This proposed recognition meant more to Floyd even than trade advantages and justice ; it was another step in the <unk> of America . It would afford relief from that political plexus which had made it impossible for one European nation to move , even in matters relating to America , without creating a corresponding movement in each of the others . He was tired of negotiating the things which related exclusively to America in London , Paris , and Madrid . 
 When General Andrew Jackson tried and executed two British agents during the First Seminole War in Spanish @-@ held Florida , it precipitated the Great Seminole Debate of 1818 – 1819 in Congress , with some claiming he exceeded his orders from President James Monroe and demanding his censure . Floyd , however , supported Jackson 's actions , maintaining he had acted according to precedent and his orders . He also denied the sovereignty of the Seminole tribes . 
 When Missouri sought statehood in 1820 , it sparked a heated debate that eventually ended with the Missouri Compromise , which allowed it to be a slave state with the admission of Maine as a free state . Prior to this compromise , various proposals were floated all swirling around allowing or prohibiting slavery in the new state . A majority of Virginia 's representatives in Congress desired the retention of slavery in Missouri at any price , however Floyd was silent , and his biographer , Ambler , has inferred from various statements made by Floyd , that he preferred immediate statehood to an extension of slavery , though admits there is " little evidence to show that he opposed the latter on general principles . " However , when anti @-@ slavery forces in Congress tried to expunge a clause in Missouri 's state constitution that would have prevented free blacks from settling in the state , Floyd opposed on the principal of state 's rights to decide its own matters and also because he was opposed to the growing Federal power . He stated : 
 If gentlemen would only expunge from their memories the progress of European liberty and institutions , they would find in America a number of states , or separate , independent , and distinct nations , confederated for common safety , and mutual protection , taught wisdom by the eternal feuds of Spain , England , France , and Germany , now consolidated into large empires . These states before the confederation could make war and peace , raise armies , or build a navy , coin money , pass bankrupt laws , naturalize foreigners , or regulate commerce ... Informed by Europe they knew <unk> would arise , and constant strife render armies in every nation necessary to their defence , which would endanger their liberties and homes . These states then , in their sovereign and independent characters , were willing to enter into a compact , by which the power of making war and peace , and regulating commerce , possessed alike by all , should be transferred to a congress of the states , to be exercised with uniformity , for their mutual benefit ; thus avoiding the evils of " <unk> and enslaved " Europe . These two were the only powers ever intended to be granted by the states . All other powers conferred by the compact are necessary to carry these two into execution . 
 Floyd 's position was that Congress had allowed Missouri to become a sovereign state and that now its only choice was whether or not to admit it into the Union . Missouri came up again during the Presidential election of 1820 . At issue was whether its electoral votes were valid , since it was still awaiting final approval of its constitution by the Congress . Floyd argued for counting its votes and the " debate which followed precipitated one of the liveliest ' scenes ' ever witnessed ... " . Disorder followed , and both Floyd and John Randolph were " so persistent in their interruptions as to necessitate an adjournment of the joint session " . A compromise was brought forward to count it as " so many with the vote of Missouri and so many without it " , but both Randolph and Floyd opposed this , which later prompted John Quincy Adams to describe their action as " an effort to bring Missouri into the Union ' by storm . ' " 
 = = = Oregon Country = = = 
 Since the end of the War of 1812 , the Oregon Country was claimed by both Britain and the United States , but neither side pressed their claim . Floyd wanted to pursue America 's interests there more aggressively and so on December 20 , 1820 , he brought this question , the first person to do so , to the attention of Congress with a resolution to appoint a committee and " inquire into the situation of the settlements upon the Pacific Ocean and the expediency of occupying the Columbia River . " The resolution passed and the committee was formed with Floyd as the chairman , and Thomas Metcalfe of Kentucky and Thomas Van Swearingen of Virginia as members . Floyd presented the committee 's report on January 21 , 1821 , along with a bill to authorize the occupation of the Columbia River area . Nothing happened with the bill , and John Quincy Adams criticized Floyd and characterized him as " a ' flaunting ' canvasser and a politician seeking to win prestige and patronage , particularly the latter , by a vigorous opposition to the party in power " and attributed his motives for occupation by " a desire to provide a retreat for a defaulting relative and possibly for himself . " Floyd then brought forth a resolution on December 10 , 1821 , to inquire into the expediency of occupying the area , and a week later presented another resolution to have the Secretary of the Navy give an estimate for a survey of harbors on the Pacific Coast . 
 On January 18 , 1822 , he introduced a bill to authorize and require the president to occupy " the territory of the United States " on the waters of the Columbia River and to organize the territory north of the 42d parallel of latitude and west of the Rocky Mountains as the " Territory of Oregon " as soon as the population reached 2000 . Floyd then asked that all the correspondence relating to the Treaty of Ghent be presented to the House , which was possibly done in an attempt to damage John Quincy Adams ' political ambitions by intimating that his negotiation neglected the United States ' interests in the West . However , Floyd 's bill was unsuccessful , as was possible attempt to discredit Adams . Floyd next capitalized on the fear of Russia 's claims of sovereignty in the area and succeeded in having a resolution adopted asking the president to inform the House whether any foreign government had communicated any claims to the territory , but the information was then deemed too sensitive to disclose to the House . 
 Not deterred in his attempt to discredit Adams , Floyd learned of a letter written by Jonathan Russell to James Monroe on December 15 , 1814 that contained " proof positive " of Adams ' neglect of the West in the treaty negotiations and he was successful in passing a resolution of inquiry that gave him the letter , but his actions backfired when the press attacked Floyd and forced him to defend his conduct . Adams certainly saw it as an attempt to damage his chances for the presidency . When President Monroe acknowledged that it was time to consider the rights of the United States in this area in December 1822 , Floyd reintroduced his bill , and argued for its passage . When a vote was taken on January 27 , 1823 , it failed to pass by a tally of 61 to 100 . Throughout the rest of 1823 and 1824 , Floyd continued in his pursuit , and when President Monroe suggested that the second session of the 18th United States Congress look into establishing a military base at the mouth of the Columbia River , Floyd reintroduced his bill . He argued : 
 I ... appeal to the House to consider well our interests in the Western Ocean , on our western coast , and the trade to China and India ; and the ease with which it can be brought down the Missouri . What is this commerce ? Thousands of years have passed by , and , year after year , all the nations of the earth have , each year , sought the rich commerce of that country ; all have enjoyed the riches of the East . That trade was sought by King Solomon , by Tyre , Sidon ; this wealth found its way to Egypt , and at last to Rome , to France , Portugal , Spain , Holland , England , and finally to this Republic . How vast and incomparably rich must be that country and commerce , which has never ceased , one day , from the highest point of Jewish splendor to the instant that I am speaking , to supply the whole globe with all the busy imagination of man can desire for his ease , comfort , and enjoyment ! Whilst we Rave so fair an opportunity offered to participate so largely in all this wealth and enjoyment , if not to govern and direct the whole , can it be possible that doubt , or mere points of speculation , will weigh with the House and cause us to lose forever the brightest prospect ever presented to the eyes of a nation ? " 
 His bill passed this time , with a vote of 115 to 57 , but if failed in the Senate . He continued to argue for settling Oregon throughout the rest of his term in Congress .

 In the period leading up to the 1824 presidential election , a leading candidate was William H. Crawford . However , malfeasance charges were brought up against Crawford and a select committee was formed to investigate the charges , the chairman of which was Floyd . Crawford rivals were determined to remove Floyd , as it was known he favored Crawford 's candidacy , but their efforts failed . The committee acquitted Crawford of the charges . 
 The 1828 presidential election did not have a clear front runner at first for the southern politicians . They were united in their determination to unseat Adams , but thought at first that Andrew Jackson 's time had passed after his unsuccessful bid in 1824 . However , his popularity had grown , and convinced that Jackson could serve as a figurehead only , while the cabinet ran things , an alliance was formed between northern " plain republicans " , with Martin Van Buren as their spokesperson , and southern " planters " , with Senator Littleton Waller Tazewell of Virginia , an intimate friend of Floyd , as their spokesperson , to put Jackson in the White House . Floyd later wrote : 
 " At this moment [ 1828 ] came the <unk> struggle between the great parties in Congress founded upon the claim which the majority ... from the north of the Potomac made to the right to lay any tax upon the importations into the United States which was intended to act as a protection to northern manufacturers by excluding foreign fabrics of the same kind . Hence all the states to the south of the Potomac became dependent upon the Northern States for a supply of whatever thing they might want , and in this way the South was compelled to sell its products low and buy from the North all articles it needed from twenty @-@ five to one hundred and twenty @-@ five per cent higher than from France to England ... At this juncture the southern party brought out Jackson . " 
 Floyd worked hard on Jackson 's behalf and considered his efforts sufficient for a post in the new cabinet , and so declined to run again for Congress . However , he did not receive this post . 
 = = = Governor of Virginia = = = 
 Floyd was Governor of Virginia from 1830 to 1834 . A rift was already forming between Floyd and other Southern politicians , as Jackson failed to act on the tariff issue and other matters . On December 27 , 1830 , Floyd wrote to a friend : 
 As you long ago wrote me , and told me personally , nay predicted , Jackson has thrown me overboard ; he is not only unwilling to give me employment , as he promised after I declined a reelection to Congress , but has in every single instance refused office to my friends , and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others . Nor does he stop here . I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him , his friends , and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia , and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill . Without having much reputation for political matters , I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly ... I am not of a temper to pocket insult , neglect , or injury . I have , my dear friend , determined on my course . I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors , and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet , but when the day of retribution shall come , it will be marked by the effects of the tomahawk . You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection . Then I will begin to formulate a message in which , as you know , my own principles will be maintained . 
 In January 1831 , Floyd was successful in his bid for re @-@ election as governor , this time for three years , and as the first governor under the new state constitution enacted in 1830 . Virginia 's economy had seen an upswing under his stewardship and in his December address he wanted to see this continue . He unveiled a " bold economic program " that included a network of state @-@ subsidized internal improvements designed to make Virginia a " commercial empire " . The success of his plan and Virginia 's future , however , depended on national politics and who captured the White House in 1832 . His preoccupation with economic growth for Virginia , and how the Jackson plans were threatening this , made him different from other southern " <unk> " , whose main fear was the abolition of slavery . Floyd opposed slavery , but purely for economic reasons as he viewed it as inefficient . " Though an implacable Southern @-@ rights man , the governor was a foe of the peculiar institution . " 
 The presidential election of 1832 was approaching , and Floyd was torn : He wanted to see Vice President Calhoun as the presidential candidate , but wondered if he should first be proposed as the vice presidential candidate for the second term . He felt Calhoun had a better chance to beat Jackson than Clay , and he wrote to Calhoun in April 1831 to know his opinion : " Under all these views I really do not know which course to take ; whether to announce you a candidate for the presidency and take the hazard of war , or wait the fate of Clay . We would be glad to know your opinion about these things . " Floyd , along with Tazewell and John Tyler , were considered the leaders of the Virginians that had become disaffected with Jackson and had turned to Calhoun . They felt that Jackson had repudiated " virtue and ability as well as Old Republican tenets . " According to historian Stephen Oates , " In Floyd 's opinion , the federal government under " King Andrew " had usurped power left and right , thus allowing the majority to run roughshod over the minority . " 
 Clay , however , did not agree to postpone his bid for presidency in favor of Calhoun , and Calhoun did not put himself forward . At some point , Floyd went home to rest for a time , and then returned to in time to witness his political friends courting the Anti @-@ Masonic party and their candidate for president , William Wirt . Floyd " refused absolutely to have anything to do with one of Wirt 's ' laxity in morals ' and ' opportune ' political thinking ; with one who would turn the federal government over to ' fanatics , knaves , and religious bigots . ' " Floyd however , ceased his objections against Jackson for a time . 
 It was at this time , that the Nat Turner slave rebellion occurred on August 21 , 1831 . In November , he decided to recommend to the General Assembly gradual abolition of slavery , either for the whole state , or for the counties west of the Blue Ridge Mountains if the former could not be attained , but with a goal for abolition for the whole state in time . However , something caused him to change his mind , for his annual message did not contain this recommendation . Instead he encouraged delegates from the western counties to introduce its discussion . However , the debate became heated and Floyd and others " became alarmed " and eastern delegates talked of splitting the state . As Floyd observed : " a sensation had been engendered which required great delicacy and caution in touching . " As a result , a vote was instead put forth on whether the state should legislate this issue . The pro @-@ slavery party narrowly won sixty @-@ seven to sixty . During Floyd 's address to the General Assembly , he did , however , touch upon the national issues swirling around the country . As Floyd 's biographer noted : 
 In clear and forceful language Floyd reasserted the state sovereignty theory of government , as guaranteed by the ' Compact or Constitution , ' holding the Federal Government to be merely the ' Agent of the States ' entrusted only with such powers as were originally intended to operate ' externally ' and ' upon nations foreign to those composing the Confederacy . ' He called attention to the disregard with which ' an unrestrained majority ' had received the memorials and protests of some of the ' sovereign states , ' justifying their acts by precedent and expediency and thus melting away ' the solder of the Federal chain ; ' also to the fact that it was then ' strongly insinuated ' that the states could not ' interpose to arrest an unconstitutional measure . ' Such a course , he was certain , could result only in nullifying the federal constitution and in a complete failure in our experiment in government . 
 When the Democratic Party announced that Van Buren would be their vice presidential candidate , Floyd was not happy . He renewed his antagonism with Jackson accordingly . Floyd felt that Van Buren 's would inject " Northern principles " into the government and would " lead with a rapidity of lightening [ sic ] to the sudden and immediate emancipation of slavery " . Virginians led the movement to prevent Van Buren 's election . Philip P. Barbour was brought forward as a running mate on a Jackson @-@ Barbour ticket . " In this way Floyd expected to throw the choice of the vice @-@ president into the Senate , where , it was thought , Van Buren 's election could be prevented . " As historian William J. Cooper noted , " For the <unk> in Virginia , replacing Van Buren with Barbour would achieve two desired goals : eliminate the man they designated as the great enemy both of Calhoun and of the Virginia doctrine as well as symbolize the political resurgence of Virginia . " Barbour , however , later withdrew his candidacy to accept Jackson 's appointment as judge of the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Virginia , and Van Buren became Vice President . 
 The Nullification Crisis had been ongoing since 1828 , and in December 1832 , Jackson came down squarely against " the <unk> " in his proclamation . However , in the presidential election of 1832 , Jackson confirmed his power in the South by winning his re @-@ election . Jackson had skillfully neutralized Barbour 's movement , and Clay did not even appear on several southern tickets . It was only in Calhoun 's stronghold of South Carolina that Jackson did not fare well : they put all their electoral votes ( 11 ) for Floyd , their ally , for President of the United States . South Carolina , at that time , had the legislature appoint their electors , and was the only state in this election to do so . 
 Floyd 's biographer commented that despite advocating moderation in his annual message in December 1832 , he was " secretly counting the costs and horrors of war " and that Floyd characterized Jackson 's Proclamation in response to South Carolina 's Nullification Ordinance as an " outrage upon our institutions " and a " satire upon the revolution " making war inevitable . A letter to Tazewell at this time called Jackson the " tyrant usurper " and feared a civil war would be the result . When Floyd learned that Clay was willing to compromise on the tariff and that South Carolina would submit her issues to a " convention of the states " , he supported both . The crisis averted , he toned down his opposition to Jackson , but was unwilling to return to the Democratic Party while Van Buren was the leader . As a result , he turned to Clay , and attempted to bring him and John C. Calhoun together in a new political party to support these views . " ... the elimination of both Clay and Calhoun from the list of <unk> for the presidency had become temporarily imperative . Accordingly Floyd set himself to the task of working out a fighting alliance between all the factions opposed to the administration . To this end he encouraged discord within the Democratic party , while scrupulously keeping the conflicting ambitions of his own friends in the background . " This was the beginnings of the Whig Party . 
 Floyd suffered a stroke in 1834 while still in office , but was able to serve out his term . He approached Littleton Waller Tazewell to be his successor , who was ultimately successful . " Believing that ' great events are in the gale ' he urged Tazewell to hasten to Richmond and to be prepared to lay down his share in the power of the state as he had lain [ sic ] it down for the ' Confederacy , ' ' uninjured and undiminished . ' " On April 16 , 1834 , he left Richmond for his home , escorted by Bigger 's Blues , Richardson 's Artillery , Myer 's Cavalry , and Richardson 's Riflemen , Richmond 's volunteer companies .

 = Mathew Charles Lamb = 
 Mathew Charles " Matt " Lamb ( 5 January 1948 – 7 November 1976 ) was a Canadian spree killer who , in 1967 , avoided Canada 's then @-@ mandatory death penalty for capital murder by being found not guilty by reason of insanity . Abandoned by his teenage mother soon after his birth in Windsor , Ontario , Lamb suffered an abusive upbringing at the hands of his step @-@ grandfather , leading him to become emotionally detached from his relatives and peers . He developed violent tendencies that manifested themselves in his physical assault of a police officer at the age of 16 in February 1964 , and his engaging in a brief shoot @-@ out with law enforcement ten months later . After this latter incident he spent 14 months , starting in April 1965 , at Kingston Penitentiary , a maximum security prison in eastern Ontario . 
 Seventeen days after his release from jail in June 1966 , Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle 's house and went on a shooting spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood , killing two strangers and wounding two others . He was charged with capital murder , which under the era 's Criminal Code called for a mandatory death penalty , but he avoided this fate when the court found , in January 1967 , that he had not been sane at the time of the incident . He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit . Over the course of six years in care at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre 's Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery , prompting an independent five @-@ man committee to recommend to the Executive Council of Ontario that he be released , saying that he was no longer a danger to society . The Council approved Lamb 's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge 's top psychiatrists , Elliot Barker . 
 Lamb continued to show improvement , becoming a productive labourer on Barker 's farm and earning the trust of the doctor 's family . With Barker 's encouragement , Lamb joined the Rhodesian Army in late 1973 and fought for the unrecognised government of Rhodesia ( modern @-@ day Zimbabwe ) for the rest of his life . He started his service in the Rhodesian Light Infantry , and won a place in the crack Special Air Service unit in 1975 , but was granted a transfer back to his former regiment a year later . Soon after he was promoted to lance @-@ corporal , Lamb was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men . He received what Newsweek called " a hero 's funeral " in the Rhodesian capital , Salisbury , before his ashes were returned to Windsor and buried by his relatives . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Mathew Charles Lamb was born in Windsor , Ontario on 5 January 1948 , the only child of a 15 @-@ year @-@ old mother who abandoned him soon after birth . Raised by an assortment of grandparents , aunts and uncles , he rarely saw his mother while growing up and never knew his father , who died in the United States while Lamb was young . Lamb spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandmother and her new husband Christopher Collins at their home on York Street in the South Central neighbourhood of Windsor , where his presence was resented by the step @-@ grandfather Collins . According to interviews with relatives , friends and neighbours conducted by Lamb 's legal counsel Saul Nosanchuk in the mid @-@ 1960s , Collins subjected the boy to sustained emotional and physical abuse , beating him and frequently calling him a " little bastard " . The direction of this violence was not limited to Lamb himself , however ; he often witnessed his step @-@ grandfather and grandmother fighting while he was still a small boy . 
 Lamb started exhibiting violent traits of his own from an early age . Nosanchuk writes that the young boy lured his cousins into his bedroom , locked them in a closet and threatened them . On one occasion he followed through with these threats and beat one of his cousins so badly that medical attention was required at a local hospital . " I remember once , " said Greg Sweet , a childhood friend , " when he was about seven years old , he held a knife to a smaller kid and made him eat dog faeces " . Lamb first attended Colbourne School in Tecumseh , where Collins later said he appeared to be normal . School staff agreed , later telling the Windsor Star that he rarely got into trouble , and was capable , but unable to concentrate for extended periods . 
 Starting with Grade 8 , when he was 13 , Lamb went to St Jude 's School in Windsor , where the other pupils found him to be distant and quiet . According to a fellow pupil , he spurned attempts by the other children to include him in their social circles . For example , Lamb once refused an invitation to a party , saying that he " didn 't like to dance . " Developing a keen interest in weapons , Lamb began to carry a knife to school , which he had little hesitation in showing off . He also became fascinated with firearms ; according to Sweet , he and Lamb " always had guns , from the time [ they ] were about 12 years old " . Sweet later told the Windsor Star that police were not informed when , as a teenager , Lamb strolled down a residential street " firing a shotgun at the houses of people he didn 't like " . Sweet also said that around this time Lamb assembled a collection of bullets and wrote the names of various local policemen on them . Lamb 's hobby even extended to crude bombs , which he taught himself to produce using parts of various weapons . When he accidentally detonated one of these concoctions during preparation his leg was sprayed with shrapnel . 
 On 10 February 1964 , barely a month after he turned 16 , Lamb confronted a physically imposing police sergeant outside the Windsor Arena and , in front of a large crowd of people , leapt upon the far larger man and repeatedly punched him in the face . According to journalist Bob Sutton 's account in the Windsor Star ( published three years later ) , Lamb did this " for no apparent reason " . Lamb was convicted of assault under the Juvenile Delinquents Act and served six months at the House of Concord , a young offenders ' unit near London , Ontario , run by the Salvation Army . Upon his release , Lamb was sent by his step @-@ grandfather to live in East Windsor with his uncle , Earl Hesketh . With Hesketh 's support , Lamb briefly attended Assumption College School , where apart from a dislike for learning Latin , he performed creditably . However , with no real motivation to study , the boy soon dropped out to look for work . He was unable to hold down a permanent job and drifted through a series of short @-@ term engagements , none lasting more than three months . 
 = = Kingston Penitentiary = = 
 On the evening of 24 December 1964 , Lamb smashed the front window of Lakeview Marine and Equipment , a sporting goods store in Tecumseh , and stole three revolvers and a double @-@ barrelled shotgun . Using one of the revolvers , he fired twice on a police constable and the shop 's co @-@ owner , missing both times . The officer returned several shots , leading Lamb to come forward with his hands raised . " Don 't shoot . I give up , " he said . He then showed the constable where he had hidden the other two handguns and the shotgun . Lamb , who turned 17 during the trial , was tried and convicted as an adult for " breaking , entering and theft ... [ and ] possession of a .22 calibre revolver , dangerous to public peace " . Motivated by a <unk> investigation report characterising Lamb as exceptionally violent , Magistrate J. Arthur Hanrahan sentenced him to two years at Kingston Penitentiary , a maximum security prison . According to Nosanchuk 's account , the severity of the sentence was unusual for a first @-@ time adult offender who had not caused anybody physical harm . Hanrahan , Nosanchuk writes , must have deemed Lamb beyond rehabilitation . The boy arrived at the penitentiary in April 1965 . 
 Psychiatric examinations and psychological tests conducted on Lamb at Kingston revealed an extremely immature young man who was strongly drawn to weapons . The prison doctors noted that the boy was very aggressive , did not tolerate discipline and had very little control over his behaviour . Soon after he arrived , Lamb assaulted another prisoner and had to be put into solitary confinement . The prison 's director of psychiatry , George Scott , said that the boy had shown signs of " an obvious mental breakdown " . Not long after this , Lamb knelt beside his bed and pushed a broom handle into his rectum . When he was discovered in this state by a guard , Scott examined the boy immediately , having to sedate him to do so . " I think this young man is developing a mental illness of hypomanic nature , " he wrote in his report . In further interviews conducted by Scott , Lamb related what the doctor described as " elaborate fantasies involving robberies , fights , and shootings that demonstrated enormous hostility " . 
 Lamb attempted suicide several times and for years afterwards bore scars where he had tried to slit his wrists . According to Nosanchuk , by early March 1966 the prisoner 's behaviour " bordered on psychotic " . During this month he threw food at an officer and was once again found with a broomstick in his rectum , this time dragging it around the floor of his cell and laughing . When Scott sedated Lamb and questioned him on the latter incident , the boy said he had just been trying to annoy the guard on duty . Scott once again noted his concern that Lamb was developing a hypomanic condition , a mania of low intensity , and on 18 March committed him to Kingston Psychiatric Hospital for a month . Scott wrote in his report to the hospital that he was not sure whether Lamb 's condition was genuine or whether he was just putting on an act . 
 Lamb returned to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that , if released , he would probably relapse into recidivism . Scott grew nervous as Lamb 's release date approached : he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community , but at the same time he was not certain about the young man 's psychiatric state , describing it as " borderline " or " marginal " . Lamb had , Scott noted , shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital . Even discounting this , the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not think he had evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound . He even still considered that the boy could just be playing immature games with the penal system . In this uncertainty , Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb 's release . The 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966 , ten months ahead of schedule , and returned home to Windsor . He was taken in by another uncle , Stanley Hesketh , who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard . Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct .

 = = = Incident = = = 
 Seventeen days after his release from Kingston Penitentiary , on the evening of 25 June 1966 , Lamb discovered a shotgun in his uncle 's house . He took the weapon and left the house shortly before 22 : 00 Eastern Time , then walked a single block north along Ford Boulevard and hid behind a tree outside number 1872 . Six young people — Edith Chaykoski , 20 , her 22 @-@ year @-@ old brother Kenneth , his wife and three friends , 21 @-@ year @-@ old Andrew Woloch , Vincent Franco and Don <unk> — were heading south from 1635 Ford Boulevard on their way to a bus stop on Tecumseh Road when they approached the tree behind which Lamb was hiding at about 22 : 15 . Lamb suddenly stepped out in front of the strangers , pointed the shotgun at them and said " Stop . Put up your hands ! " When Edith Chaykoski stepped forward , towards Lamb , he shot her in the abdomen . Woloch then moved and was hit in the stomach by a second shot , which also wounded Kenneth Chaykoski . Lamb then ran across the street to 1867 Ford Boulevard and fired on a girl whose silhouette he had spotted in a side doorway of the house ; his target , 19 @-@ year @-@ old Grace Dunlop , was injured . As law enforcement and medical assistance were summoned , Lamb strolled away and walked two blocks before knocking on a door , which he had seemingly chosen at random . Pointing the shotgun at the elderly lady who lived there , Ann Heaton , he threatened to kill her . When Heaton cried out to her husband Forrest to phone the police , Lamb fled , throwing the shotgun over the old couple 's fence into a field . He returned to the Hesketh house and went to sleep . 
 Edith Chaykoski died from her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05 : 30 on 26 June . Police searched the neighbourhood during the morning and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it . They identified it as Hesketh 's and concluded that the 18 @-@ year @-@ old must have taken it and gone on a shooting spree the previous day . Lamb was arrested at 15 : 30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski . Under the terms of Canadian law at that time , he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted . When Woloch 's injuries also proved fatal at 14 : 45 on 11 July 1966 , his murder was added to Lamb 's charge . 
 = = = Psychiatric examination = = = 
 On the morning of 27 June 1966 , Lamb appeared without legal counsel at Essex County Magistrate 's Court in Windsor , where he was remanded for psychiatric examination . As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon , the boy attempted to escape custody and , when restrained , begged the officers to shoot him . A private psychiatrist from Windsor , Walter Yaworsky , gauged the teenager 's mental state in an interview starting at 12 : 30 . Yaworsky said that Lamb was " hyperactive and agitated " ; he was unable to sit still and periodically rose from his seat and paced around the room . He was silent for a few minutes , apparently irritated , then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria . When questioned by Yaworsky directly , Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview : he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing . 
 After dismissing a few more questions as " unimportant " , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old giggled childishly and said he " needed a lawyer " . Lamb 's conversation with the doctor continued incoherently , with Lamb " leaping from topic to topic " , in Yaworsky 's words . The young man continued to rise and pace around the room as the interview went on ; he spoke in a casual , off @-@ hand manner , giving non @-@ specific answers to the doctor 's questions and describing people especially vaguely . When asked about his parents , he simply said " I don 't remember . " Yaworsky then inquired where his mother was , leading the boy to laugh as he replied , " I don 't remember . Somewhere . " When the doctor finally asked directly about the night of the shootings , Lamb said that he could not recall shooting anybody and that all he remembered was going home in a taxi , then being awoken by his uncle shaking him . 
 When the interview ended at 13 : 35 , the doctor noted that he found Lamb 's hour @-@ long maintenance of this seemingly hypomanic behaviour " remarkable " . Simulation on Lamb 's part was unlikely , Yaworsky believed , and lack of memory credible . The doctor wrote in his report that Lamb had been " suffering from a disease of the mind " at the time of the shootings , which had caused him to be in a kind of dream world , outside of reality . Standing before the magistrate that same afternoon , Yaworsky testified that Lamb was mentally unsound and not fit to stand trial . The magistrate once again remanded Lamb , this time to custody at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre for a minimum of 30 days . Lamb was again examined on 29 June 1966 , this time by James Dolan , the Clinical Director of Psychiatry at St Thomas Elgin General Hospital . 
 Lamb described the incident for Dolan in far more detail . He said that on 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15 : 00 , refused to work overtime ( having put in 62 hours that week ) , then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21 : 00 . He woke up soon after , he said , and loaded his uncle 's shotgun , intending to kill himself . " Next thing I knew , " he continued , " I was on the street . " He told Dolan that he had seen people " as if they were on television " . He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away , and remembered a voice that was not his own saying " Put up your hands " . He then remembered hearing the dim , far @-@ off gun again , a vision of a terrified man standing before him , then yet another shot . He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street , seeing a girl 's outline in a doorway and " somehow " shooting at her . Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car , and that " everything seemed unreal . " He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby , suddenly thinking " what the hell am I in here for " and leaving . He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of <unk> and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle 's house . 
 After 30 days , on 27 July , the staff at Penetanguishene still deemed him unfit to stand trial , but by 27 August 1966 his state had improved enough for the doctors to allow his return to custody at Windsor . The doctors reported that he could now face the court — they said that the young man was now able to understand what the proceedings against him meant , and capable of working alongside a legal advisor . Because Lamb could not afford legal counsel , Justice Saul Nosanchuk was assigned by a local legal aid plan to advise him in the upcoming trial . Nosanchuk says that Lamb had " no hesitation " in signing a paper authorising the justice to represent him . 
 = = = Mental disorder defence = = = 
 Nosanchuk quickly resolved that the only way to win the case and prevent the teenager from being hanged was to explore the background and circumstances both of the incident and of Lamb himself with a view to a mental disorder defence . At their first interview together , Nosanchuk says that Lamb was a " slightly built , almost frail , quiet and detached 18 @-@ year @-@ old ... very boyish in appearance . He had an exceedingly polite demeanour . He was most appreciative and grateful that I had undertaken his defence . " When Nosanchuk asked the boy about the events of 25 June , Lamb became hesitant , disjointed and confused in his conversation ; " he seemed to view these events as if he was not really involved in them , " Nosanchuk recalled . Lamb said that although he did have a faint recollection of what had happened , he could not remember taking the shotgun , loading it or shooting anybody . He said that earlier during the afternoon on 25 June he had watched a film on television in which somebody had shot and killed several people , but did not make clear whether he had been re @-@ enacting this . The lawyer then asked Lamb to discuss his personal background , childhood and family . The 18 @-@ year @-@ old was very reluctant to do so and when he did , Nosanchuk says that the boy seemed emotionally detached from the relatives and events he described . 
 Lamb appeared to the justice to be a profoundly troubled young man . There was no doubt that he had killed Chaykoski and Woloch , he had not acted in self @-@ defence and there was no evidence of provocation ; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim . Nosanchuk felt obliged , in the light of Lamb 's psychiatric and personal history , to explore an insanity plea . The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan , secured them as witnesses for the trial , and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client . According to this report , Lamb had been amiable , fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible ; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June , but on continued questioning related what had happened " in detail " . He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened . He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions , even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong . When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done , they wrote that he " clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse " . He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness , mental or otherwise . The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb " suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti @-@ social or psychopathic personality " , which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court . 
 However , Nosanchuk was still not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds . In Ontario at that time , a defendant found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province 's Executive Council , acting on the advice of a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge . Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won , Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life . It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain , offering to plead guilty to non @-@ capital murder , which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years . In any case , Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity . Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter , Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence . The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms , the state still had the right to detain him for the rest of his life . 
 Nosanchuk then considered whether or not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial . He already had a strong defence , with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary , who had agreed to testify on his behalf . The lawyer considered the boy 's probable reaction to a cross @-@ examination by the prosecution in court . Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface , and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way . Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb 's answers for what they really were , Nosanchuk feared that Lamb 's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane , which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows . He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand . 
 = = Trial = = 
 After a brief preliminary hearing starting on 8 October 1966 , during which Lamb reportedly showed no signs of emotion , the young man 's trial for capital murder began on 16 January 1967 at Essex County Courthouse in Windsor . Because of the charge 's severity , the case was heard by a judge and jury under the auspices of Ontario 's Supreme Court , which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside . The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch ; Nosanchuk then opened his mental disorder defence under Section 562 of the Canadian Criminal Code . Stark gave an order allowing all relevant psychiatric doctors to remain , then allowed the Crown to open its case against Lamb . 
 = = = <unk> and cross @-@ examinations = = = 
 Prosecution 
 The prosecutor , Eugene Duchesne QC , began his case by calling Mathew Lamb 's uncle , Stanley Hesketh , to the stand . Hesketh testified that three hours after the shootings his nephew had told him that he " must have done it " . He said that since his nephew had come to live with him following his release from prison , he had always been exceptionally polite and helpful to his family . However , during the morning of 26 June Lamb had for the first time been hesitant , not giving full answers to questions and generally acting in a less open manner . Duchesne then called witnesses of the shootings , who agreed unanimously that Lamb had been unhurried , cool and collected . When cross @-@ examined by Nosanchuk about this unusual calmness , they said that Lamb had appeared very distant and did not seem to have any bearing on what was happening around him : one of the witnesses said that Lamb had not appeared to even notice a very loud party in progress across the street . Heaton said that the boy had looked frightened and had fled without reason when she called to her husband . The police officers who arrested Lamb also agreed that the defendant had been unusually cool and silent . Hesketh told the court that when he had come home his nephew had been fast asleep in bed . 
 Defence 
 The defence began to present its psychiatric evidence on the third day of the trial , 18 January 1967 , when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb 's behalf . Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings ; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June , and had at one point giggled and exclaimed " poor broad " , referring to Edith Chaykoski . So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence , showing no emotion whatsoever , but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy 's having " giggled " at this point of the 27 June interview , Lamb did so again in a similar manner . Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial , and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident ; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street , but that everything had then " felt fuzzy " when he fired the gun . Yaworsky quoted Lamb : " It was as if I was invisible . ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room . All of a sudden , I was standing there with a gun in my hand — that is when I ran out . " The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality . Dolan then testified along similar lines , describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky 's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate " the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being " . 
 In his cross @-@ examination of the two doctors , Duchesne cited the psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966 , which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125 , far above most of his 18 @-@ year @-@ old peers . The prosecutor proposed that it was not beyond Lamb , with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence , to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people . Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible , they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident . 
 John Robinson , the governor of Essex County Jail , was then called by the defence . Robinson testified that during Lamb 's time in the county jail , his conduct had been impeccable except for an incident five weeks before the trial , on 10 December 1966 , when he had , for no apparent reason , gone on what Robinson called a " rampage " . In an episode lasting three hours , the defendant had smashed over 100 windows , set fire to blankets and broken plumbing , causing cells to flood . " I was amazed by what I saw , " Robinson said . " The pupils were dilated like someone who comes in heavy on narcotics — except their eyes appear sunk in and his were bulged out . " George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary then told the court that Lamb lived in a fantasy dream world , which had existed in his mind since early childhood , and had been in a pre @-@ psychotic state when released from jail on 8 June 1966 . This , he said , had boiled over into an " acute schizoid episode " on the night of the shootings . In cross @-@ examination , Scott was pressed as to why he had allowed Lamb 's release from Kingston if this was the case ; he replied that although the prison officers had been concerned about Lamb 's mental state on his release , there had not been conclusive grounds to certify him insane at that time . 
 Three more psychiatrists from Penetanguishene were then called by Nosanchuk . George Darby told the court that in his conversations with Lamb the defendant had changed his story three times . He considered Lamb to be anti @-@ social , aggressive and psychopathic — unable to appreciate the incident 's consequences with any depth of feeling . Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him in an interview that he treated all people " like bugs " except for his uncle and grandmother ; killing a human being , Barker told the court , meant nothing more to Lamb than <unk> a fly . Barry Boyd then confirmed what Barker had said , and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview : " I hate everybody on the street . I probably will kill someone else before I die — it doesn 't bother me — it 's like killing a bug . " Elizabeth Willet , a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit , then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ , but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child , aged between 3 and 6 . He had few defence mechanisms , she said , and when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences . 
 Prosecution 
 Duchesne now called on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd to counter the defence 's evidence . Orchard , another doctor from Penetanguishene , testified that Lamb had suddenly abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966 . He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane and said that he was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them . Boothroyd , of <unk> Hospital in Toronto , then spoke , arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted , knowing and understanding what that meant . Lamb , he said , was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able to understand the nature of what he had done . Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd 's testimony , asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him . He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far . 
 = = = Closing statements = = = 
 Defence 
 Nosanchuk gave his final statement to the court first . Speaking for the defence , he reminded the jury that every one of the doctors speaking on Lamb 's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector . He conceded that the defendant 's actions were senseless and violent , but stressed that if found not guilty by reason of insanity , Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary . He argued that Lamb 's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to carefully consider them : the victims were not known to Lamb ; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself ; Lamb acted alone ; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act ; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway ; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant , then left without doing anything ; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon , leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found ; then , finally , the boy simply went home to bed as if nothing had happened . Was this , Nosanchuk asked , the behaviour of a premeditated killer , or of a profoundly disturbed young man who did not appreciate what he was doing ? 
 Prosecution 
 In response , Duchesne gave what Nosanchuk writes was a " well @-@ reasoned argument " , which the jury paid rapt attention to . Duchesne declared that the incident had been the cold , calculated murder of a defenceless group of innocent young people by an ex @-@ convict , released only three weeks earlier and already known as an anti @-@ social psychopath . The defendant had given wildly conflicting stories to different doctors , Duchesne said , yet had convinced each one . Duchesne said that this was possible as Lamb was highly intelligent and able to project a false front if it suited him . The prosecutor then moved off the topic of Lamb 's mental state and focussed on the matter of criminal responsibility in general . Five out of the eight psychiatrists in the court , the prosecutor said , had testified that Lamb had understood on an intellectual level that shooting Chaykoski and Woloch would kill them , which he asserted should be enough to incur criminal responsibility , even taking the psychiatric evidence into account . Finding Lamb not guilty by reason of insanity , he reasoned , would provide an inexpedient precedent in Canadian law and cause a spate of similar insanity defence attempts . 
 = = = Verdict = = = 
 Justice Stark then reviewed the evidence and advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence ; however , he reminded them , it was up to them to decide . The jury retired at 16 : 30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision , and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19 : 00 to give their verdict . They found Lamb to be not guilty by reason of insanity . Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read . 
 = = Psychiatric care = = 
 = = = Treatment at Oak Ridge = = = 
 As had been made clear several times before and during the trial , Lamb 's court victory did not make him a free man . He was escorted by police back to Penetanguishene and placed in the hospital 's maximum security unit at Oak Ridge , where he was to remain indefinitely pending an order from the Ontario Executive Council . 
 Elliot Barker , the head of Oak Ridge 's therapeutic division , had already interviewed Lamb in 1966 and spoken on his behalf at his trial . The doctor had arrived at Penetanguishene in 1959 , and in 1965 stepped up his efforts to reform the unit 's programmes , which on his arrival were still based around the traditional methods of neuroleptic <unk> and electroconvulsive therapy , supplemented by long periods of isolation for each inmate . Barker innovated a programme whereby the patients could spend more of their time in each other 's company , in a more natural environment ; he believed that the key to overcoming these illnesses was communication . " My original vision , " he writes , " was that I wasn 't really dealing with patients . I thought we could evolve a social structure where people could resolve the internal conflicts in community . " Barker 's " Social Therapy Unit " ( STU ) , initially made up exclusively of young male psychopaths and schizophrenics of normal intelligence , began in September 1965 , with a programme of 80 hours of treatment a week , focussing on cures brought about by mutual cooperation and interaction . Joan <unk> , the medical editor of the Toronto Globe and Mail , volunteered in 1967 to spend two days at Oak Ridge as if she were a patient , and afterwards heaped praise on the inmates , saying that they were " pioneering a brave and exciting experiment in self @-@ government and self @-@ therapy ... [ displaying ] individual responsibility , co @-@ operation with colleagues and authority , and acceptance of rules reached by consensus . " 
 In August 1968 the unit created a " Total Encounter Capsule " , which was a windowless , soundproofed room , 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) wide and 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) long , with green @-@ painted walls , a green wall @-@ to @-@ wall mat on the floor and a ceiling containing a one @-@ way mirror . It was empty apart from a sink and lavatory . In one of the earliest uses of videotape in therapy , television cameras were trained through the mirrored ceiling and through holes in the walls . Liquid nourishment was provided through drinking straws that were built into the door . The Capsule 's purpose , Barker writes , was to provide " a place of undisturbed security where a small group of patients could focus on issues they felt important enough to warrant the exclusion of the usual physical and psychological distractions . " Though participation in the STU programme was required , entering the Capsule was voluntary , and each patient could choose how many days he spent inside . Groups numbered between two and seven and stayed in the room for as little as 24 hours or for sustained periods as long as 11 days . Because Barker believed that they were more inclined to reveal their inner selves if unclothed , the inmates entered the Capsule naked . To further encourage communication , they were administered with LSD @-@ 25 . The room was lit at all times , making day indistinguishable from night . While members of the programme were inside the Capsule , other patients operated the room and watched over those inside , running the cameras , keeping records and maintaining an appropriate room temperature . 
 Following his arrival in January 1967 , Lamb enthusiastically took part and thrived in Barker 's new programmes , becoming , the Montreal Gazette writes , " a model inmate " . He became widely respected by his fellow patients and was successfully nominated as the ward 's " patient therapist " . " He was helpful to the other patients , " Barker told the Globe and Mail , " and they looked up to him . " Barker elaborated on this subject in an interview with the Windsor Star , telling them that during 1972 Lamb had been " one of the most respected therapists in the hospital " . Lamb started a newspaper at Oak Ridge , for which he wrote articles while also encouraging others to contribute . Barker and his colleagues were so impressed by the young man 's progress that they began to take him to lectures at Ontario Police College in Aylmer , where they introduced him as evidence of rehabilitation 's potential . After about five years at Oak Ridge , the matter of Lamb 's liberty was taken up by a five @-@ man Advisory Review Board made up of Ontario Supreme Court Justice Edson Haines , two independent psychiatrists unrelated to Lamb 's case , a lawyer and a lay person . The advisory board 's recommendation that Lamb be released was approved by the Ontario Executive Council in early 1973 ; the board gave him a clean bill of health and said he was no longer dangerous . 
 = = = Release and further improvement = = = 
 The conditions of Lamb 's release were that he must spend a year living with the Barker family on their 200 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 80 sq km ; 0 @.@ 31 sq mi ) farm , under the doctor 's observation . The former inmate proved to be an industrious labourer , helping to fence the property and becoming one of the farm 's best workers . Barker and his wife came to trust Lamb so closely that they allowed him to babysit their three @-@ year @-@ old daughter , who became very attached to the young man . During his time living and working on the farm , Lamb read a number of books on psychiatry , including The Mask of Sanity by Hervey M. Cleckley , which affected him particularly . He told the doctor that he had come to terms with his condition as a psychopath and that he wished to go overseas and do something purposeful with his life . At the same time , he considered a career in the military , which Barker supported . " He wanted that kind of life , " Barker later told the Globe and Mail . " He really seemed to need the esprit de corps of an army organisation . " When Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6 October 1973 , starting the Yom Kippur War , Lamb thought he had found his calling — using money he had saved from his labourer 's salary and gifts from his grandmother , he bought State of Israel Bonds and , with Barker 's encouragement , travelled to Israel to volunteer for the Israel Defense Forces . However , after hitch @-@ hiking to the Israeli lines , Lamb became disillusioned by conversations he had with the soldiers there , many of whom were loath to fight and wanted to go home . He applied anyway , but was turned down because of his psychiatric history . He resolved to instead tour the world , and to that end left Israel days after arriving , intending to travel to Australia . 
 = = Military career in Rhodesia = = 
 On his way to Australia in October 1973 , Lamb stopped off in South Africa and Rhodesia ( today Zimbabwe ) , where he cut his travels short to enlist in the Rhodesian Army . According to Barker , Lamb travelled to Africa with this intention all along . Rhodesia 's unrecognised and predominantly white government was at that time fighting a war against communist @-@ backed black nationalist guerrillas who were attempting to forcibly introduce majority rule . Like most of the foreign volunteers in the Rhodesian forces , Lamb mustered into the Rhodesian Light Infantry ( RLI ) , an all @-@ white heliborne commando battalion engaged largely in counter @-@ insurgency operations . He and the other foreign soldiers received the same pay and conditions of service as the Rhodesians they served alongside . " In many respects the RLI was a mirror of the French Foreign Legion , in that recruiters paid little heed as to a man 's past and asked no questions , " writes Chris Cocks , a veteran of the unit , " and like the Foreign Legion , once in the ranks , a man 's past was irrelevant . " So it proved for Lamb ; keeping his past a secret , he became a highly regarded and popular member of 3 Commando , RLI , noted for his professionalism and physical fitness . " The Rhodesians thought he was a first @-@ class soldier , " Barker later told the Globe and Mail . 
 Lamb visited his aunt and uncle in Windsor on leave in May 1975 , " proudly wearing his uniform " , journalist Tony Wanless writes . Turned out in the RLI 's tartan green ceremonial dress and green beret , he was conspicuous walking along Ouellette Avenue , one of the city 's main thoroughfares . Coincidentally , a funeral procession was being held for Edith Chaykoski 's grandmother along that very street at the same time , leading Edith 's younger brother Richard to spot Lamb on the pavement . The soldier remained oblivious , but his presence horrified the Chaykoski family . " He had the uniform and looked a little different , " Richard told the Windsor Star a year later , " but I never forgot his face . " Chaykoski 's mother was so upset by the incident that for some time afterwards she refused to leave the house alone . While staying with the Hesketh family , Lamb went to see Barker and told him that serving in the Rhodesian security forces had enriched him personally and made him respect himself for the first time . Because of this he wished to forget about his previous life in Canada ; in particular he said he " didn 't want it associated with his adopted country " . He expressed his concern that if he were killed or captured , the Canadian press might reveal his prior history and embarrass the Rhodesian Army , the Canadian government and the Penetanguishene mental hospital . However , he said , he felt great loyalty towards Rhodesia and would still go back to continue his service . 
 Lamb was deeply saddened by the bias he perceived the Western media to have against the Rhodesian government and army , but was reportedly conspicuous for leaping to the defence of any black Rhodesians he thought were receiving bad treatment . " He sympathised with the blacks , " Barker told the Windsor Star , " but believed that chaos would result if they took over immediately . He used to scrap with other soldiers who treated blacks badly . He was very bright and knew the blacks would eventually take over the country . " 
 Soon after his furlough to Canada , Lamb was transferred from the RLI to the elite Special Air Service ( SAS ) unit in September 1975 . There he trained as a paratrooper and , after passing selection , found himself in a vastly different role to the one he had become used to during his time in the RLI . Rather than taking part in the RLI 's fast and furious Fireforce counter @-@ strike procedures , he found himself taking part in covert reconnaissance actions , " acting as eyes and ears , " as Barbara Cole writes . Wishing to see more action , Lamb requested a posting back to the RLI , which was granted ; he rejoined 3 Commando . In late 1976 , at the age of 28 , he was promoted to lance @-@ corporal and took command of a " stick " of four men from 12 Troop , 3 Commando on Fireforce duty on Operation Thrasher , which covered Rhodesia 's eastern highlands against guerrilla activity . 
 In the late afternoon of 7 November 1976 , three insurgents from a group of seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the <unk> Tribal Trust Lands , just south @-@ west of Birchenough Bridge in <unk> province . Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas . There were eight four @-@ man " stops " involved in a Fireforce , and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2 . Just before they left , Lamb ran over to Lance @-@ Corporal Phil Kaye , the leader of Stop 3 , and shouted over the noise of the aircraft . " They are going to get me this time , " he yelled , sardonically ; " Just you watch , Phil Kaye ! " Kaye and his MAG gunner , Trooper Pat Grogan , waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving . " Go nail gooks ! " Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship . Lamb 's men were an 18 @-@ year @-@ old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese @-@ Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares ; Trooper Cornelius Olivier , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle ; and Trooper Tony Rok , an Australian Vietnam veteran , aged 28 and also equipped with an FN . Lamb carried the stick 's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands . 
 Stop 2 landed , formed up into a sweep line and marched carefully to the north alongside a dry riverbed . As darkness fell , just as they came to a widening in the riverbed , they were suddenly fired upon by an unseen foe . All four men dropped to the ground to avoid being hit . The Canadian lance @-@ corporal called for covering fire from Soares , which he provided as Lamb and Rok rose to their feet and cautiously moved forward . A dark figure suddenly ran across the soldiers ' line of sight , between Lamb and the riverbed , and from a distance of about 16 paces Olivier reflexively swung his rifle around and let off a frenzied , imprecise burst of fire . Mortally wounded by two errant shots through the chest , Lamb stumbled , slumped to the ground and lay face @-@ down in a heap . One of the bullets exited through the back of his body , smashing the radio he had been carrying . He died almost instantly . Meanwhile , the cadres ahead ran headlong into Stop 1 , led by Sergeant Derrick Taylor , and were all killed in the ensuing fire fight . Taylor 's stick sustained no casualties . When the battle was over , Stops 1 and 3 joined Olivier , Rok and Soares and waited beside Lamb 's lifeless body all night until it could be evacuated by helicopter to the local hospital at <unk> . The death was officially recorded as " killed in action " , with no reference to friendly fire . 
 = = Reactions to death ; military funeral and burial = = 
 As Lamb had predicted , his death provoked stories in the Canadian local and national media that strongly stressed his history of violence and insanity . It even caused a heated debate in the Canadian House of Commons over why , considering his personal history in Ontario and subsequent service in the armed forces of a country Canada did not recognise , Lamb had been issued a valid Canadian passport and allowed to renew it on 26 April 1976 . The Chaykoski family received the news with some relief , Wanless reported in the Windsor Star , having " lived in terror " since Lamb 's release from Penetanguishene three years earlier . 
 In Rhodesia , by contrast , Lamb was posthumously held in very high regard by the men who had served alongside him . His photograph in full dress uniform was placed on 3 Commando 's Wall of Honour and remained there until the RLI was disbanded in 1980 . When the story of his earlier life in Canada was run by the Rhodesia Herald , the paper received numerous strongly worded letters from soldiers who refused to believe it . They demanded a printed retraction and apology , which the Herald gave soon after to preempt any further scandal . The lance @-@ corporal was given what the Windsor Star and Newsweek both described as a " hero 's funeral " in the Rhodesian capital , Salisbury , on 15 November 1976 . No members of his family were present . His coffin , draped in the Rhodesian flag and topped with a large bouquet of flowers , was carried on a gun carriage to Warren Hills Cemetery , on the western outskirts of the city , where soldiers of the RLI fired three volleys of shots and senior officers saluted as the coffin was carried to the crematorium on the shoulders of eight RLI men . Lamb 's ashes were afterwards returned to his relatives in Windsor , Ontario , where they were buried alongside the remains of his grandmother . 
 = Dayton , Ohio = 
 Dayton ( / <unk> / ; local pronunciation : / <unk> / ) is the sixth @-@ largest city in the state of Ohio and is the county seat of Montgomery County . A small portion of the city extends into Greene County . In the 2010 census , the population was 141 @,@ 527 , and the Dayton metropolitan area had 799 @,@ 232 residents , making it the fourth @-@ largest metropolitan area in Ohio , after Cleveland , Cincinnati , and Columbus and the 63rd @-@ largest in the United States . The Dayton @-@ Springfield @-@ Greenville Combined Statistical Area had a population of 1 @,@ 080 @,@ 044 in 2010 , making it the 43rd @-@ largest in the United States . Dayton is situated within the Miami Valley region of Ohio , just north of the Cincinnati – Northern Kentucky metropolitan area . 
 Ohio 's borders are within 500 miles ( 800 km ) of roughly 60 percent of the country 's population and manufacturing infrastructure , making the Dayton area a logistical centroid for manufacturers , suppliers , and shippers . Dayton also plays host to significant research and development in fields like industrial , aeronautical , and <unk> engineering that have led to many technological innovations . Much of this innovation is due in part to Wright @-@ Patterson Air Force Base and its place within the community . With the decline of heavy manufacturing , Dayton 's businesses have diversified into a service economy that includes insurance and legal sectors as well as healthcare and government sectors . 
 Other than defense and aerospace , healthcare accounts for much of the Dayton area 's economy . Hospitals in the Greater Dayton area have an estimated combined employment of nearly 32 @,@ 000 and a yearly economic impact of $ 6 @.@ 8 billion . It is estimated that Premier Health Partners , a hospital network , contributes more than $ 2 billion a year to the region through operating , employment , and capital expenditures . In 2011 , Dayton was rated the No. 3 city in the nation out of the top 50 cities in the United States by HealthGrades for excellence in health care . Many hospitals in the Dayton area are consistently ranked by Forbes , U.S. News & World Report , and HealthGrades for clinical excellence . 
 Dayton is also noted for its association with aviation ; the city is home to the National Museum of the United States Air Force and is the birthplace of Orville Wright . Other well @-@ known individuals born in the city include poet Paul Laurence Dunbar and entrepreneur John H. Patterson . Dayton is also known for its many patents , inventions , and inventors that have come from the area , most notably the Wright brothers ' invention of powered flight . In 2008 , 2009 , and 2010 , Site Selection magazine ranked Dayton the No. 1 mid @-@ sized metropolitan area in the nation for economic development . Also in 2010 , Dayton was named one of the best places in the United States for college graduates to find a job . 
 = = History = = 
 Dayton was founded on April 1 , 1796 , by a group of 12 settlers known as " The Thompson Party . " They traveled in March from Cincinnati up the Great Miami River by pirogue and landed at what is now St. Clair Street , where they found two small camps of Native Americans . Among the settlers was Benjamin Van Cleve , whose memoirs provide insights into the history of the Ohio Valley . Two other groups who were traveling overland arrived several days later . 
 In 1797 , Daniel C. Cooper laid out Mad River Road , the first overland connection between Cincinnati and Dayton , opening the " Mad River Country " to settlement . Ohio was admitted into the Union in 1803 , and the city of Dayton was incorporated in 1805 . The city was named after Jonathan Dayton , a captain in the American Revolutionary War who signed the U.S. Constitution and owned a significant amount of land in the area . In 1827 , construction on the Dayton @-@ Cincinnati canal began , which would provide a better way to transport goods from Dayton to Cincinnati and contribute significantly to Dayton 's economic growth during the 1800s . 
 Historically , Dayton has been the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s . According to the National Park Service , citing information from the U.S. Patent Office , Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870 . The Wright brothers , inventors of the world 's first airplane , and Charles F. Kettering , world @-@ renowned for his numerous inventions , hailed from Dayton . The city was also home to James Ritty 's " <unk> Cashier " , the first mechanical cash register , and Arthur E. Morgan 's " hydraulic jump " , a flood prevention mechanism that helped pioneer modern @-@ day hydraulic engineering . Paul Laurence Dunbar – a famous African @-@ American poet and novelist – penned his most famous works in the late 19th century and became an integral part of the city 's history . 
 Innovation led to business growth in the region . In 1884 , John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty 's National Manufacturing Company along with his cash register patents and formed the National Cash Register Company ( NCR ) . The company manufactured the first mechanical cash registers and played a crucial role in the success and shaping of Dayton 's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s . In 1906 , Charles F. Kettering , a leading engineer at the company , helped develop the first electric cash register , which propelled NCR into the national spotlight . NCR also helped develop the US Navy bombe , a code @-@ breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II . 
 A catastrophic flood occurred in March 1913 , known as the Great Dayton Flood , which led to the establishment of the Miami Conservancy District , a series of dams and hydraulic jumps installed around Dayton , in 1914 . Like other cities across the country , Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II . Several locations around the city hosted the Dayton Project , a branch of the larger Manhattan Project , to develop polonium triggers which were used in early atomic bombs . The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city , including high demand for housing and other services . At one point , emergency housing was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region , much of which is still in use today . 
 Between the 1940s and the 1970s , the city saw significant growth in suburban areas as a result of population migration . Veterans were returning from military service in large numbers seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs , a part of the local industry that was expanding rapidly . Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom . New , modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further away from the downtown area . More than 127 @,@ 000 homes were built in Montgomery County alone during the 1950s . 
 Since the 1980s , however , Dayton 's population has been in decline , mainly due to the loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas , as well as the national housing crisis that began in 2008 . While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons , the negative impact on Dayton has been greater than most . Dayton had the third @-@ greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s , behind only Cleveland and Youngstown . Despite this , Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors of the local economy such as healthcare and education . New expansion downtown began in the 2000s helping to revitalize the city and encourage growth . Fifth Third Field , home of the Dayton Dragons , was built in 2000 . The highly successful minor league baseball team has been an integral part of Dayton 's culture . In 2001 , the city 's public park system , Five Rivers MetroParks , constructed an outdoor entertainment venue known as <unk> <unk> that attracts more than 400 @,@ 000 visitors a year . A new performance arts theater , the Schuster Center , opened in 2003 . A large health network in the region , Premier Health Partners , expanded its Miami Valley Hospital location with a 12 @-@ story tower addition . 
 In 2010 , the Downtown Dayton Partnership , in cooperation with the City of Dayton and community leaders , introduced the Greater Downtown Dayton Plan . It focuses on job creation and retention , infrastructure improvements , housing , recreation , and collaboration . The plan is to be implemented through the year 2020 . 
 = = = Peace accords = = = 
 In 1995 , the Dayton Agreement , a peace accord between the parties to the hostilities of the conflict in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia , was negotiated at Wright @-@ Patterson Air Force Base , near Fairborn , Ohio , from November 1 – 21 . 
 Richard Holbrooke wrote about this event in his memoirs : 
 There was also a real Dayton out there , a charming Ohio city , famous as the birthplace of the Wright <unk> citizens energized us from the outset . Unlike the population of , say , New York City , Geneva or Washington , which would scarcely notice another conference , <unk> were proud to be part of history . Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the " temporary center of international peace " . The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle , drawing the people deeper into the proceedings . When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown , people crowded around , saying that they were praying for us . Warren Christopher was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant . Families on the air base placed " candles of peace " in their front windows , and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base . One day they formed a " peace chain " , although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight @-@ thousand @-@ acre base . Ohio 's famous ethnic diversity was on display . 
 = = = Nickname = = = 
 Dayton is known as the " Gem City . " The origin of the nickname is uncertain , but several theories exist . In the early 19th century , a well @-@ known racehorse named " Gem " hailed from Dayton . In 1845 , an article published in the Cincinnati Daily Chronicle by an author known as " T " stated : 
 In a small bend of the Great Miami River , with canals on the east and south , it can be fairly said , without infringing on the rights of others , that Dayton is the gem of all our interior towns . It possesses wealth , refinement , enterprise , and a beautiful country , beautifully developed . 
 In the late 1840s , Major William D. Bickham of the Dayton Journal initiated a campaign to officially nickname Dayton as the " Gem City " . The name was eventually adopted by the city 's Board of Trade several years later . Paul Laurence Dunbar referred to the nickname in his poem , " Toast to Dayton " , as noted in the following excerpt : 
 Dayton also plays a role in a nickname given to the state of Ohio : " Birthplace of Aviation " . Dayton is the hometown of the Wright brothers , aviation pioneers who are credited with inventing and building the world 's first successful airplane . After their first manned flights in Kitty Hawk , North Carolina , which had been chosen due to its ideal weather and climate conditions , the Wrights returned to Dayton and continued testing at nearby Huffman Prairie . 
 Additionally , Dayton is colloquially referred to as " Little Detroit " . This nickname comes from Dayton 's prominence as a Midwestern manufacturing center .

 Unlike many Midwestern cities of its age , Dayton has very broad and straight downtown streets ( generally two or three full lanes in each direction ) , facilitating access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular .

 = Siege of Pondicherry ( 1793 ) = 
 For other sieges with this name , see Siege of Pondicherry ( disambiguation ) 
 The Siege of Pondicherry was a colonial military operation in the early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars . Britain and France both controlled colonies on the Indian Subcontinent and when the French National Convention declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793 , both sides were prepared for conflict in India . British India was centred on the principal ports of Bombay , Madras and Calcutta , administered by the East India Company . French India was governed from Pondicherry ( modern Puducherry ) on the Coromandel Coast . British forces in India were considerably stronger than the French , with the British Indian Army supported by British Army detachments and a Royal Navy squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral William Cornwallis . Pondicherry 's defenses were strong , but the garrison was too small to effectively man the walls , and although a French frigate squadron was stationed at the distant Île de France , it was unable to effectively protect the French Indian coast . 
 News of the outbreak of war took five months to reach the Indian Ocean but British forces , recently engaged in the Third Anglo @-@ Mysore War , were mobilised in preparation and immediately seized the ports of French India . Only Pondicherry was able to resist , and a siege was instigated on 1 August 1793 by Colonel John Braithwaite while Cornwallis imposed a naval blockade . British forces constructed trenches and batteries , often under heavy fire , over the following weeks . Twenty days after the city was cut off , Braithwaite began a bombardment of the defences . Within hours the French commander Colonel Prosper de Clermont requested a truce , followed the next morning by an unconditional surrender . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the 1790s Great Britain was the largest colonial power on the Indian Subcontinent , its administration based at the port of Calcutta in Bengal , supported by the cities of Madras and Bombay and a network of subsidiary coastal trading stations . The administration of British India was largely delegated to the East India Company , which maintained the standing British Indian Army supported by detachments from the regular British Army . This force had been heavily engaged in the Third Anglo @-@ Mysore War of 1789 to 1792 . Naval support was provided by a squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral William Cornwallis in the frigate HMS Minerva , which had blockaded Tellicherry during the Mysore War . 
 The French military position in India was considerably weaker than the British , with no significant investment in the colonies since the outbreak of the Seven Years ' War in 1754 . The French held a number of small trading ports , including Karaikal , Yanam , Mahé and Chandernagore but the most important colony was at Pondicherry , close to Madras . Pondicherry was formidably fortified , the extensive and modern defences designed by Camille Charles Leclerc , Chevalier de Fresne , but the garrison was far too small to effectively man the walls in the face of a determined siege . The French Navy presence in the Indian Ocean at the outbreak of war comprised the two frigates Cybèle and Prudente under Contre @-@ amiral Saint @-@ Félix but were not based in India at all , but on the distant Île de France ( modern Mauritius ) . 
 Tensions in Europe had been steadily mounting since the French Revolution of 1789 and in 1792 the French Revolutionary Wars began with war between the new French Republic and the Austrian and Prussian Empires . Great Britain was not initially engaged in this conflict , but diplomatic relations with France were rapidly deteriorating . On 1 February 1793 , shortly after the execution of the deposed King Louis XVI , the French National Convention declared war on Britain and the Dutch Republic . Due to the long distances involved , it took five months for news of the outbreak of war to reach India , passing through the British consul at Alexandria , George Baldwin . On 2 June the news arrived at Madras and passed to Calcutta on 11 June . The Governor @-@ General of India Lord Cornwallis issued instructions for operations against the territories of French India . Lord Cornwallis , brother to William , originally intended to participate in the surrender of Pondicherry himself in the seized French merchant ship Bien Aimé , but was eventually dissuaded . 
 = = Siege of Pondicherry = = 
 Admiral Cornwallis was anchored at Trincomalee in Dutch Ceylon when he learned of the outbreak of war on 19 June . He immediately gave orders to sail for Pondicherry , which he placed under blockade . Shortly afterward he captured a merchant ship carrying ammunition supplies to the French port and , after a brief stop at Madras , Minerva and three accompanying East Indiamen captured the French privateer Concorde leaving Pondicherry on 3 July and seized a snow in the roads on 9 July . On 13 July sails appeared to the southeast , Cornwallis assuming they belonged to reinforcements . On investigation , however , this ship proved to be the 40 @-@ gun Cybèle and three smaller vessels , carrying supplies and a unit of artillerymen to Pondicherry to reinforce the garrison . On closing with the French frigate , Cornwallis discovered that the East India Company ships supporting his blockade had become scattered and in the delay gathering them Cybèle successfully escaped pursuit . 
 On land , the army at Madras was placed under the command of Colonel John Braithwaite . After assembling his forces at <unk> , Braithwaite marched on Pondicherry , occupying <unk> to the southwest and Arian Coupang to the south , cutting off the garrison from the supporting hinterland of the city . On 28 July , Braithwaite reached the city and established positions on the Red Hill overlooking Pondicherry , sending a demand to its commander Colonel Prosper de Clement that he surrender . The demand was refused , and Braithwaite ordered detachments from the 71st and 74th Regiments of Foot to occupy positions to the south of the city 's walls on 30 July , a manoeuvre which prompted heavy fire from the bastions . This move was however a feint , Braithwaite planned to launch his main assault on the northeast corner where the defences were weaker and the ground drier . 
 Attempts were then made to establish batteries to the west and north of the city , but these efforts were hampered by heavy rain , delaying the construction of defensive earthworks which allowed the garrison to maintain a constant fire on the work parties , which suffered consequent casualties . Fire was especially heavy against the siege lines to the north of the city , which were easily targeted by the French gunners on 12 August . Operations to establish batteries on this front continued for several days even as losses mounted ; on 15 August Lieutenant Colonel George Maule , Braithwaite 's chief engineer , was killed by cannon fire while returning from a night inspection of the trenches . On the night of 21 August the main battery , known as the Royal Battery came under heavy shellfire and was damaged , but repairs were successful and on the morning of 22 August its battery of 24 @-@ pounder long guns opened return fire on the city . 
 Within hours of the first shots from the Royal Battery , the French defenses opposite fell silent , the only return fire coming from more distant flanking batteries . British fire intensified at noon when a battery of mortars opened a bombardment , and at 16 : 30 flags of truce were raised over the city 's bastions . Clermont 's offer requested a 24 ceasefire to negotiate terms , but Braithwaite allowed only until 08 : 00 the following morning , during which time the construction of British earthworks would continue . Clermont , isolated and unsupported , accepted the terms , and the following morning Braithwaite 's army entered the city and took possession , although the French garrison had seized liquor supplies during the night and were too drunk to formally surrender . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 British losses during the siege of 88 killed and 131 wounded were relatively heavy ; French casualties were not recorded but were thought to be negligible as few defenders were exposed to British fire during the only day of bombardment . Captured in the city were 645 French soldiers and 1 @,@ 014 sepoys with 167 guns of varying sizes and materials and substantial quantities of ammunition . Elsewhere the other French Indian colonies of Karaikal , Yanam , Mahé and Chandernagore all surrendered when summoned without conflict , assuring British dominance among the European powers on the Indian Subcontinent . It has been noted that British naval forces in the Bay of Bengal were unusually weak during this period , Minerva the only warship on active operations , and had the French managed to concentrate their forces in the region they might have considerably extended the siege of Pondicherry and caused considerable damage to British merchant shipping in the region . The French made no efforts to recapture their lost Indian territories during the war , but regained them under the terms of the Peace of Amiens in 1802 . 
 = Scottish Parliament = 
 The Scottish Parliament ( Scottish Gaelic : <unk> na h @-@ Alba ; Scots : The Scots <unk> ) , is the devolved national , unicameral legislature of Scotland . Located in the Holyrood area of the capital city , Edinburgh , it is frequently referred to by the metonym " Holyrood " . 
 The Parliament is a democratically elected body comprising 129 members known as Members of the Scottish Parliament ( MSPs ) , elected for four @-@ year terms under the additional member system : 73 MSPs represent individual geographical constituencies elected by the plurality ( " first past the post " ) system , while a further 56 are returned from eight additional member regions , each electing seven MSPs . The most recent general election to the Parliament was held on 5 May 2016 , with the Scottish National Party winning a plurality . 
 The original Parliament of Scotland ( or " Estates of Scotland " ) was the national legislature of the independent Kingdom of Scotland , and existed from the early 13th century until the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain . As a consequence , both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England ceased to exist , and the Parliament of Great Britain , which sat at Westminster in London was formed . 
 Following a referendum in 1997 , in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution , the current Parliament was convened by the Scotland Act 1998 , which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature . The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament – the areas in which it can make laws – by explicitly specifying powers that are " reserved " to the Parliament of the United Kingdom . The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster . The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament , and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws . The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999 . 
 = = History of the Scottish parliament = = 
 Before the Treaty of Union 1707 united the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England into a new state called " Great Britain " , Scotland had an independent parliament known as the Parliament of Scotland . Initial Scottish proposals in the negotiation over the Union suggested a devolved Parliament be retained in Scotland , but this was not accepted by the English negotiators . 
 For the next three hundred years , Scotland was directly governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom , both seated at Westminster , and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity . Suggestions for a ' devolved ' Parliament were made before 1914 , but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War . A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence , and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution . One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self @-@ government for Scotland , within the unitary state of the United Kingdom . Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs . 
 During this time , the discovery of oil in the North Sea and the following " It 's Scotland 's oil " campaign of the Scottish National Party ( SNP ) resulted in rising support for Scottish independence , as well as the SNP . The party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should . The combined effect of these events led to Prime Minister Wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974 . However , it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly were passed by the United Kingdom Parliament . 
 Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1978 , an elected assembly would be set up in Edinburgh provided that a referendum be held on 1 March 1979 , with at least 40 % of the total electorate voting in favor of the proposal . The 1979 Scottish devolution referendum failed : although the vote was 51 @.@ 6 % in favour of a Scottish Assembly , with a turnout of 63 @.@ 6 % , the majority represented only 32 @.@ 9 % of the eligible voting population . 
 Throughout the 1980s and 1990s , demand for a Scottish Parliament grew , in part because the government of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party , while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs . In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat , the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group , leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches , political parties and representatives of industry taking part . Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995 , the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament . 
 Devolution continued to be part of the platform of the Labour Party which , in May 1997 , took power under Tony Blair . In September 1997 , the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved Scottish Parliament , with tax @-@ varying powers , in Edinburgh . An election was held on 6 May 1999 , and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament . 
 = = Building and grounds = = 
 Since September 2004 , the official home of the Scottish Parliament has been a new Scottish Parliament Building , in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh . The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle . Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf @-@ shaped buildings , a grass @-@ roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings . Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs , such as shapes based on Raeburn 's Skating Minister . Crow @-@ stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby , complete the unique architecture . Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004 . 
 In March 2006 , one of the Holyrood building 's roof beams slipped out of its support and was left dangling above the back benches during a debate . The debating chamber was subsequently closed , and MSPs moved to The Hub for one week , whilst inspections were carried out . During repairs , all chamber business was conducted in the Parliament 's committee room two . 
 = = = Temporary accommodation 1999 – 2004 = = = 
 Whilst the permanent building at Holyrood was being constructed , the Parliament 's temporary home was the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh . Official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the Assembly Hall , which is part of the School of Divinity of the University of Edinburgh . This building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the Church 's General Assembly . In May 2000 , the Parliament was temporarily relocated to the former Strathclyde Regional Council debating chamber in Glasgow , and to the University of Aberdeen in May 2002 . 
 In addition to the General Assembly Hall , the Parliament also used buildings rented from the City of Edinburgh Council . The former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge was used for the MSP 's offices . Following the move to Holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished . The former Midlothian County Buildings facing Parliament Square , High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh ( originally built as the headquarters of the pre @-@ 1975 Midlothian County Council ) housed the Parliament 's visitors ' centre and shop , whilst the main hall was used as the Parliament 's principal committee room . 
 = = Officials = = 
 After each election to the Scottish Parliament , at the beginning of each parliamentary session , Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer , the equivalent of the speaker ( currently Ken Macintosh ) , and two MSPs to serve as deputies . The Presiding Officer and deputies are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs , which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament . Principally , the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body . When chairing meetings of the Parliament , the Presiding Officer and his / her deputies must be politically impartial . During debates , the Presiding Officer ( or the deputy ) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks , who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings . A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks . 
 As a member of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body , the Presiding Officer is responsible for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff , property and resources it requires to operate . <unk> the Parliamentary Bureau , which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber , is another of the roles of the Presiding Officer . Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the Presiding Officer and one representative from each political parties with five or more seats in the Parliament . Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber , establish the number , remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation ( bills ) through the Parliament . The Presiding Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity . 
 The Presiding Officer controls debates by calling on members to speak . If a member believes that a rule ( or standing order ) has been breached , he or she may raise a " point of order " , on which the Presiding Officer makes a ruling that is not subject to any debate or appeal . The Presiding Officer may also discipline members who fail to observe the rules of the Parliament . 
 The member of the Scottish Government whose duty it is to steer Executive business through Parliament is the Minister for Parliamentary Business ( currently Joe <unk> ) . The minister is appointed by the First Minister and is a Junior Minister in the Scottish Government , who does not attend cabinet . 
 = = Parliamentary chamber = = 
 The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle , which reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members . There are 131 seats in the debating chamber . Of the total 131 seats , 129 are occupied by the Parliament 's elected MSPs and 2 are seats for the Scottish Law Officers – the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland , who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members of the Scottish Government . As such the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but , as they are not elected MSPs , cannot vote . 
 Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber , but typically sit in their party groupings . The First Minister , Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers sit in the front row , in the middle section of the chamber . The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle , with opposing parties on either side . The Presiding Officer , parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber . 
 In front of the Presiding Officers ' desk is the parliamentary mace , which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words : Wisdom , Compassion , Justice and Integrity . The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament , which are the first words of the Scotland Act , are inscribed around the head of the mace , which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament , representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws . Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament 's official opening in July 1999 , the mace is displayed in a glass case , suspended from the lid . At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber , the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass , to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place . 
 = = Proceedings = = 
 Parliament typically sits Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Thursdays from early January to late June and from early September to mid December , with two @-@ week recesses in April and October . Plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on Wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 6 pm and on Thursdays from 9 : 15 am to 6 pm . Chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public . Entry is free , but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space . Meetings are broadcast on the Parliament 's own channel <unk> and on the BBC 's parliamentary channel BBC Parliament . Proceedings are also recorded in text form , in print and online , in the Official Report , which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates . 
 Since September 2012 , the first item of business on Tuesday afternoons is usually Time for Reflection at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes , sharing a perspective on issues of faith . This contrasts with the formal style of " Prayers " , which is the first item of business in meetings of the House of Commons . Speakers are drawn from across Scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the Scottish census . Invitations to address Parliament in this manner are determined by the Presiding Officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau . Faith groups can make direct representations to the Presiding Officer to nominate speakers . Before September 2012 , Time for reflection was held on Wednesday afternoons . 
 The Presiding Officer ( or Deputy Presiding Officer ) decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak . Normally , the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak . Typically , ministers or party leaders open debates , with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes , and succeeding speakers allocated less time . The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate . Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems . Members may call each other directly by name , rather than by constituency or cabinet position , and hand clapping is allowed . Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English , but members may use Scots , Gaelic , or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer . The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language . 
 Each sitting day , normally at 5 pm , MSPs decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day . This " Decision Time " is heralded by the sounding of the division bell , which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs who are not in the chamber to return and vote . At Decision Time , the Presiding Officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking " Are we all agreed ? " , to which the chamber first votes orally . If there is audible dissent , the Presiding Officer announces " There will be a division " and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks . Each MSP has a unique access card with a microchip which , when inserted into the console , identifies them and allows them to vote . As a result , the outcome of each division is known in seconds . 
 The outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote . Parties entrust some MSPs , known as whips , with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line . MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions , since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties . Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections , and , in serious cases , may be expelled from their parties outright . Thus , as with many Parliaments , the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low , and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party 's policies are rare . In some circumstances , however , parties announce " free votes " , which allows Members to vote as they please . This is typically done on moral issues . 
 Immediately after Decision Time a " Members Debate " is held , which lasts for 45 minutes . Members Business is a debate on a motion proposed by an MSP who is not a Scottish minister . Such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member 's own constituency , an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time . As well as the proposer , other members normally contribute to the debate . The relevant minister , whose department the debate and motion relate to " winds up " the debate by speaking after all other participants . 
 = = Committees = = 
 Much of the work of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee . The role of committees is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems , partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber . The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses , conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation . Committee meetings take place on Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting . Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland . 
 Committees comprise a small number of MSPs , with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament . There are different committees with their functions set out in different ways . Mandatory Committees are committees which are set down under the Scottish Parliament 's standing orders , which govern their remits and proceedings . The current Mandatory Committees in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are : Public Audit ; Equal Opportunities ; European and External Relations ; Finance ; Public Petitions ; Standards , Procedures and Public Appointments ; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform . 
 Subject Committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session , and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across Parliament . Typically each committee corresponds with one ( or more ) of the departments ( or ministries ) of the Scottish Government . The current Subject Committees in the fourth Session are : Economy , Energy and Tourism ; Education and Culture ; Health and Sport ; Justice ; Local Government and Regeneration ; Rural Affairs , Climate Change and Environment ; Welfare Reform ; and Infrastructure and Capital Investment . 
 A further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government . Private bills normally relate to large @-@ scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property . Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network , the Glasgow Airport Rail Link , the Airdrie @-@ Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland .

 The Scotland Act 1998 , which was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and given royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 November 1998 , governs the functions and role of the Scottish Parliament and delimits its legislative competence . The Scotland Act 2012 extends the devolved competencies . For the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty , the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of Scotland . However , under the terms of the Scotland Act , Westminster agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over Scottish domestic policy to the Scottish Parliament . Such " devolved matters " include education , health , agriculture and justice . The Scotland Act enabled the Scottish Parliament to pass primary legislation on these issues . A degree of domestic authority , and all foreign policy , remain with the UK Parliament in Westminster . The Scottish Parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax @-@ varying capability . Another of the roles of the Parliament is to hold the Scottish Government to account . 
 The specific devolved matters are all subjects which are not explicitly stated in Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act as reserved matters . All matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament . Most importantly , this includes agriculture , fisheries and forestry , economic development , education , environment , food standards , health , home affairs , Scots law – courts , police and fire services , local government , sport and the arts , transport , training , tourism , research and statistics and social work . The Scottish Parliament has the ability to alter income tax in Scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound . The 2012 Act conferred further fiscal devolution including borrowing powers and some other unconnected matters such as setting speed limits and control of air guns . 
 Reserved matters are subjects that are outside the legislative competence of the Scotland Parliament . The Scottish Parliament is unable to legislate on such issues that are reserved to , and dealt with at , Westminster ( and where Ministerial functions usually lie with UK Government ministers ) . These include abortion , broadcasting policy , civil service , common markets for UK goods and services , constitution , electricity , coal , oil , gas , nuclear energy , defence and national security , drug policy , employment , foreign policy and relations with Europe , most aspects of transport safety and regulation , National Lottery , protection of borders , social security and stability of UK 's fiscal , economic and monetary system . 
 Members of the public take part in Parliament in two ways that are not the case at Westminster : a public petitioning system , and cross @-@ party groups on policy topics which the interested public join and attend meetings of , alongside MSPs . The Parliament is able to debate any issue ( including those reserved to Westminster ) but is unable to make laws on issues that are outside its legislative competence . 
 = = = Bills = = = 
 As the Scottish Parliament is able to make laws on the areas constitutionally devolved to it , the legislative process begins with bills ( draft laws ) which are presented to Parliament . 
 Bills can be introduced to Parliament in a number of ways ; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill ; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit ; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member ; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer . Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party . Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages : 
 Stage 1 is the first , or introductory stage of the bill , where the minister or member in charge of the bill will formally introduce it to Parliament together with its accompanying documents – Explanatory Notes , a Policy Memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill , and a Financial Memorandum setting out the costs and savings associated with it . Statements from the Presiding Officer and the member in charge of the bill are also lodged indicating whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the Parliament . Stage 1 usually takes place , initially , in the relevant committee or committees and is then submitted to the whole Parliament for a full debate in the chamber on the general principles of the bill . If the whole Parliament agrees in a vote to the general principles of the bill , it then proceeds to Stage 2 . 
 Stage 2 is normally conducted entirely in the relevant committee , where amendments to the bill are proposed by committee members . At this stage , the bill is considered in substantial detail . Some bills – and all emergency bills – are considered in detail by a committee of the whole Parliament in the debating chamber ; the Presiding Officer acts as convener of the committee in such circumstances . 
 Stage 3 is the final stage of the bill and is considered at a meeting of the whole Parliament . This stage comprises two parts : consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate , and a final vote on the bill . Opposition members can table " wrecking amendments " to the bill , designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time , to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken . After a general debate on the final form of the bill , members proceed to vote at Decision Time on whether they agree to the general principles of the final bill . 
 Royal assent : After the bill has been passed , the Presiding Officer submits it to the Monarch for royal assent and it becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament . However he cannot do so until a 4 @-@ week period has elapsed , during which the Law Officers of the Scottish Government or UK Government can refer the bill to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom for a ruling on whether it is within the powers of the Parliament . Acts of the Scottish Parliament do not begin with a conventional enacting formula . Instead they begin with a phrase that reads : " The Bill for this Act of the Scottish Parliament was passed by the Parliament on [ Date ] and received royal assent on [ Date ] " . 
 = = Scrutiny of government = = 
 The party , or parties , that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament forms the Scottish Government . In contrast to many other parliamentary systems , Parliament elects a First Minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term ( after a general election ) . Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister , and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament . Normally , the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister , and head of the Scottish Government . Theoretically , Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet , but such ministers are , in practice , appointed to their roles by the First Minister . Junior ministers , who do not attend cabinet , are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments . Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs , with the exception of Scotland 's Chief Law Officers : the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General . Whilst the First Minister chooses the ministers – and may decide to remove them at any time – the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the Sovereign . 
 Under the Scotland Act 1998 , ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years ( 1999 , 2003 , 2007 and so on ) . The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer . If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved ( with at least two @-@ thirds of the Members voting in favour ) , or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant , the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation . Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections , unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election , in which case they supplant it . The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May , a multiple of four years after 1999 ( i.e. , 5 May 2011 , 7 May 2015 , etc . ) . 
 Several procedures enable the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government . The First Minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question . For example , at the beginning of each parliamentary year , the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government 's legislative programme for the forthcoming year . After the statement has been delivered , the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement . 
 Parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber . A " General Question Time " takes place on a Thursday between 11 : 40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the Scottish Government . At <unk> , a 40 @-@ minute long themed " Question Time " takes place , where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day , such as health and justice or education and transport . Between 12 p.m. and 12 : 30 p.m. on Thursdays , when Parliament is sitting , First Minister 's Question Time takes place . This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction . Opposition leaders ask a general question of the First Minister and then supplementary questions . Such a practice enables a " lead @-@ in " to the questioner , who then uses their supplementary question to ask the First Minister any issue . The four general questions available to opposition leaders are : 
 To ask the First Minister what engagements he / she has planned for the rest of the day ? 
 To ask the First Minister when he / she next plans to meet the Prime Minister and what issues they intend to discuss ? ; 
 To ask the First Minister when he / she next plans to meet the Secretary of State for Scotland and what issues they intend to discuss ? and 
 To ask the First Minister what issues he / she intends to discuss at the next meeting of the Scottish Government 's cabinet ? . 
 Members who wish to ask general or themed questions , or questions of the First Minister , must lodge them with parliamentary clerks beforehand and selections are made by the Presiding Officer . Written questions may also be submitted by members to ministers . Written questions and answers are published in the Official Report . 
 = = Members , constituencies and voting systems = = 
 Elections for the Scottish Parliament were amongst the first in Britain to use a mixed member proportional representation ( MMP ) system . The system is a form of the additional member method ( AMS ) of proportional representation , and is better known as such in Britain . Under the system , voters are given two votes : one for a specific candidate and one for a political party . 
 Of the 129 MSPs , 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as " Constituency MSPs " . Voters choose one member to represent the constituency , and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP . The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland , prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs , with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own constituency MSP . Currently , the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55 @,@ 000 electors . Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland , this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands , where the bulk of Scotland 's population live , and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country , which have a low population density . The island archipelagos of Orkney , Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of electors , due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh . If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament , this triggers a by @-@ election in his or her constituency , where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system . 
 The remaining 56 MSPs , called " List MSPs " , are elected by an additional members system , which seeks to make the overall results more proportional , countering any distortions in the constituency results . Seven List MSPs are elected from each of eight electoral regions , of which constituencies are sub @-@ divisions : 
 Central Scotland 
 Glasgow 
 Highlands and Islands 
 Lothian 
 Mid Scotland and Fife 
 North East Scotland 
 South Scotland 
 West Scotland 
 Each political party draws up a list of candidates standing in each electoral region , from which the List MSPs are elected . When a List MSP resigns , the next person on the resigning MSPs ' party 's list takes the seat . 
 The total number of seats in the Parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d 'Hondt method . For example , to determine who is awarded the first list seat , the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region ( at this point just constituency seats ) . The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat , which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat . This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated . 
 As in the House of Commons , a number of qualifications apply to being an MSP . Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981 . Specifically , members must be over the age of 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom , the Republic of Ireland , one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations , a citizen of a British overseas territory , or a European Union citizen resident in the UK . Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs , and similarly , civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified . An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament if he or she is judged to be insane under the terms of the Mental Health ( Care and Treatment ) ( Scotland ) Act 2003 . 
 = = Elections = = 
 There have been five elections to the Parliament , in 1999 , 2003 , 2007 , 2011 and 2016 . 
 The next Scottish Parliament election is due to be held on Thursday 6 May 2021 . Under the Scotland Act 1998 , an ordinary general election to the Scottish Parliament would normally have been held on the first Thursday in May four years after the 2016 election , i.e. in May 2020 . This would clash with the proposed date of the next United Kingdom general election . In November 2015 , the Scottish Government published a Scottish Elections ( Dates ) Bill , which proposed to extend the term of the Parliament to five years . That Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 25 February 2016 and received Royal Assent on 30 March 2016 , setting the new date for the election as 6 May 2021 . 
 As with all elections in the UK , Irish and qualifying Commonwealth citizens are entitled to vote . Unlike elections to the Westminster parliament , citizens of other non @-@ Commonwealth EU member states who are resident in Scotland are entitled to vote in elections to the Scottish Parliament . Overseas electors on Scottish electoral registers are not allowed to vote in Scottish Parliament elections . From the 2016 election , the franchise for Scottish Parliament elections was expanded to include 16 and 17 year olds .

 A procedural consequence of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament is that Scottish MPs sitting in the UK House of Commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to England , Wales and Northern Ireland – whilst English , Scottish , Welsh and Northern Irish Westminster MPs are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament . This phenomenon is known as the West Lothian question and has led to criticism . Following the Conservative victory in the 2015 UK election , standing orders of the House of Commons were changed to give MPs representing English constituencies a new " veto " over laws only affecting England . 
 = Revelation ( Third Day album ) = 
 Revelation is the ninth studio album by American Christian rock band Third Day , released on July 29 , 2008 . The album was produced by Howard Benson , who had decided to work with the band after rock singer Chris Daughtry drew attention to lead singer Mac Powell 's vocal ability . Although they were initially uncomfortable working with Benson , Third Day achieved a positive working relationship with Benson , who felt that their different religious beliefs made them challenge each other in a way reflected in the record . 
 In recording Revelation , Third Day aimed to produce a southern rock album while being more creative musically ; the band felt the end result was their best record to date . As a whole , the album is noted as adopting a heavier and edgier rock sound than Third Day 's previous adult contemporary @-@ projects such as Wherever You Are ( 2005 ) , while the album 's lyrics reflect Christian themes . The album features guest appearances from Chris Daughtry , Lacey Mosley of alternative metal band Flyleaf , and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph . 
 Revelation received positive reviews from music critics . Although some expressed minor concerns about the short length of the album 's songs and the quality of the record 's second half as compared to its first , many critics regarded it as one of Third Day 's best studio albums while others praised the guest appearances on the album . It won several awards at the 40th GMA Dove Awards while the song " Born Again " received multiple nominations at the 52nd Grammy Awards . Revelation debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 , number two on the Rock Albums chart , and number one on the Christian Albums chart , selling a total of 75 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . The album 's four singles all performed successfully on Christian radio , three of them topping at least one Christian chart format . Revelation has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , signifying shipments of over 500 @,@ 000 copies .

 Third Day , intending to " shake things up " , made some significant changes to its management prior to the production of Revelation . The band left Creative Trust Management and signed with Red Light , which represented such artists as Dave Matthews Band , Switchfoot , and Rodney Atkins . They also chose to work with mainstream producer Howard Benson , who had worked on projects with other bands that Third Day had enjoyed . Benson decided he wanted to work with Third Day after Chris Daughtry drew his attention to Mac Powell 's vocal ability . Benson , who is Jewish , said that he enjoys working with Christian artists such as Third Day because they believe in something . He added that their different religious beliefs prompted discussions about faith between himself and the band , which Benson said " comes out in the record because of the way I challenge them and they challenge me " . Third Day were initially uncomfortable at first working with Benson , as the band 's achievements in the Christian music realm meant nothing in the world of mainstream record production . Despite the band 's insecurity at the start , they appreciated the experience the end of the process . The decision to use Benson led to the band recording the album in Los Angeles instead of Atlanta , Georgia . 
 During production , Benson felt one recording session with Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf went beyond the ordinary to the point where he left the recording room and told Powell " You have to go out there , and you and her do this because you 're coming to God right now in front of my eyes . You guys handle it " . According to Benson , both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio . In a separate session with Mosley , bassist Tai Anderson said that , after recording the end of the song " Run to You " , Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band . Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration , Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn 't have to do the recording . Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band 's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years . 
 With Revelation , Third Day aimed to give their fans a record with their southern rock sound while being more creative . The band said they pushed themselves hard for the record , pushing the album 's release date back so they could work on lyrics and songs despite pressure from their label for a finished product . They ultimately felt the album was among their best lyrically and " more than what fans were expecting [ musically ] " . The band 's drummer , David Carr , acknowledged the cliche of a band member calling their latest effort their best one , but was confident that Revelation would be the best if all the band 's previous efforts were compared . Tai Anderson , the group 's bassist , said they did not intend the album to be a mainstream record , pointing to the cross on the album 's cover . However , he said that they didn 't rule out the possibility of mainstream exposure . After the album was complete , guitarist Brad Avery left the band . 
 Revelation was produced by Howard Benson . Recording was handled by Mike Plontikoff at Bay 7 Studios in Valley Village and at Sparky Dark Studio in Calabasas , California ; it was mixed by Chris Lord @-@ Alge at Resonate Music in Burbank , California . Pre @-@ production was handled at Haunted Hollow Studio in Charlottesville , Virginia by Rob Evans and Steve Miller , at Tree Sound Studios in Norcross , Georgia by Don McCollister , and at Sonica Recording in Atlanta , Georgia by Jon Briglevich . Mastering was handled by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering in Portland , Maine . Digital editing was handled by Paul <unk> , and audio engineering was handled by Ashburn Miller , with additional engineering handled by Hatsukazu Inagaki . 
 Chris Daughtry provided backing vocals on " Slow Down " . Lacey Mosley provided backing vocals on " Run to You " and a duet on " Born Again " . Robert Randolph provided pedal steel work on " Otherside " . Scotty Wilbanks provided piano on " Revelation " . Debbie Lurie created the string arrangement on " Let Me Love You " ; the string track was recorded at Entourage Studios . Brad Avery provided additional guitar work . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Revelation possesses a heavier , edgier rock sound than many of Third Day 's previous albums , which leaned towards an adult contemporary sound ; this is particularly noticeable when compared to 2005 's Wherever You Are . The opening track " This Is Who I Am " is a southern rock song seen by reviewers as demonstrating the band 's confidence and security in their musical style . Its lyrics call for God to accept people for their flaws and make them better . " Slow Down " is a rock song featuring backing vocals from Chris Daughtry of the rock band Daughtry and lyrics asking that God " pace our lives " . The first single from the album , " Call My Name " , is a pop rock song , while " Run to You " is a mid @-@ tempo ballad set in 6 / 8 time . 
 The title track addresses the uncertainty many Christians face in asking for God 's intervention . " Otherside " has a " bluesy " and southern rock sound with an accompaniment from pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph . " Let Me Love You " is a love song for humanity written from the perspective of God . " I Will Always Be True " has a " jangly pop / rock style " , while " Give Love " has influence from the folk music genre . " Ready " has a distinct energetic sound closer to past ballads made by Third Day , and " Take It All " is an adult contemporary song combining electric and acoustic guitar work with lyrics emphasizing spiritual surrender . 
 = = Packaging = = 
 The liner notes for Revelation state that the album art is " an artistic interpretation " of Salvation Mountain , a monument created by Leonard Knight as " a public art project designed to send the message that ' God Loves Everyone ' " . Located in Calipatria , California , the location is entered in the Congressional Record as a ' national treasure ' . The album cover is of Salvation Mountain with the song titles of Revelation composed on it , " to send [ Third Day 's ] own message of God 's love to the world " . According to bassist Tai Anderson , the idea to use Salvation Mountain as the album cover art was lead vocalist Mac Powell 's idea . Anderson recalled that Third Day received critiques about the album art , with people claiming it ripped off the cover art of Radiohead 's album Hail to the Thief ( 2003 ) . Although he admits there " are similarities " between the two , Anderson denied that the band based the design off of " outside sources " . Anderson also said he was more concerned with the album art 's coloring , as " red @-@ skewed " album covers had been used by bands such as U2 and Green Day . In hindsight , Anderson felt that the band " probably would have used one of the other images from the packaging on the cover just so we wouldn 't have to read the one star critiques on iTunes which never reference the music , just the album cover " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Reception to Revelation was positive , with some critics regarding the album as one of Third Day 's best albums to date . Andree Farias of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars and commented that " Revelation finds Third Day trying new things , but not to the extent that they sound like a different band " . He felt that the change of environment " intimidated [ Third Day ] for the better " , making them not settle for " middle of the road " songs . He described the album 's sound as " muscular " and " anthemic ... unquestionably populist , yet the closest Third Day has come to replicating the Southern @-@ fried goodness of Time " . He regarded Revelation as " the best album Third Day has released this decade " and considered the album a return to the " unbridled fervor " Third Day was characterized by early in their career . 
 Deborah Evans @-@ Price of Billboard magazine described the album as " one of the best of the year " and praised Mac Powell 's vocals as " possessing just the right amount of gritty intensity combined with sweet Southern charm " and as " equally effective on tender ballads like " Let Me Love You " and such hard @-@ charging rockers as " This Is Who I Am " . Matt Conner of CCM Magazine gave Revelation four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars , opining that " The production on Revelation showcases a seasoned band working with a new @-@ yet @-@ veteran producer in Howard Benson ... And the results are perhaps the band 's best work to date " and praising the guest appearances by Chris Daughtry and Lacey Mosley . 
 Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today commented that " I 've heard lead singer Mac Powell and the others say that they put more blood and sweat into their tenth studio album than any previous effort . It 's not just hyperbole , it 's a Revelation , and it ranks with their best albums so far " , but noted that the album is " briskly paced with 13 songs in just 43 minutes ; only the radio single " Call My Name " runs over 4 minutes . That 's a good thing in that the album easily holds your attention from one lean song to another , but it deprives Third Day the opportunity to delve into longer instrumental jams or deeper lyrics about the conversations we share with God during the darker times in life " . Graeme Crawford of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten stars and opined that " the newly slimmed down band deliver a quality record that all Third Day fans will enjoy " and that it " should be investigated by anyone with even a passing interest in rock music " . 
 John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave Revelation four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars and commented that " If the album doesn 't grab the listener from Powell 's soulful southern drawl and an accompanying acoustic before " This Is Who I Am " breaks wide open , closer attention to the words and themes that permeate the album should bring to light what is actually one of the strongest records so far this year " and stated that " Revelation is an honest , emotional , vulnerable , beautiful , and delicious southern rock record " ; however , he also stated that " only fault [ of Revelation ] may be that its greatest strengths double as a minor weakness " . He elaborated that the album 's second half , despite consisting of " wonderful " songs that he wouldn 't think to leave out , was slightly worse than the album 's first half , which he characterized as having an edgier sound . Debra Akins of Gospel Music Channel described Revelation as " a solid exclamation of who Third Day is musically , while underscoring the cultural relevancy they 've continued to display over the years " and also praised the album as a whole , commenting that " there are no throw @-@ away tracks on this CD , and that 's a rarity in today 's fast @-@ paced , song @-@ driven music industry " . 
 At the 40th GMA Dove Awards , Revelation won the award for Pop / Contemporary Album of the Year . The award was presented to them by Revive , a band who Third Day had discovered while touring in Australia . Revelation also won the award for Recording Music Packaging of the Year award , which recognized the artists of the album cover , Tim Parker and Becka Blackburn , both part of Provident Label Group 's creative team . " Born Again " was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the 52nd Grammy Awards – the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song and the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance .

 = Huế chemical attacks = 
 The Huế chemical attacks occurred on 3 June 1963 , when soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) poured liquid chemicals from tear gas grenades onto the heads of praying Buddhists in Huế , South Vietnam . The Buddhists were protesting against religious discrimination by the regime of the Roman Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm . The attacks caused 67 people to be hospitalised for blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments . 
 The protests were part of the Buddhist crisis , during which the Buddhist majority in South Vietnam campaigned for religious equality after nine people were killed by government forces while defying a ban that prevented them from flying the Buddhist flag on Vesak . The incident prompted the United States to privately threaten to withdraw support for Diệm 's government and when the Americans finally reduced aid a few months later , the army took it as a green light for a coup . An inquiry determined that the chemical used in the attack was a liquid component from old French tear gas grenades that had never functioned properly . The findings exonerated the ARVN soldiers from charges that they had used poison or mustard gas . The outcry over the attack had already forced Diệm to appoint a panel of three cabinet ministers to meet with Buddhist leaders for negotiations regarding religious equality . The talks led to the signing of the Joint Communique , but the policy changes it provided were not implemented and widespread protests continued , leading to the assassination of Diệm in a military coup .
