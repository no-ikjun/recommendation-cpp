 By May , most of the Indian interior experiences mean temperatures over 32 ° C ( 90 ° F ) , while maximum temperatures often exceed 40 ° C ( 104 ° F ) . In the hot months of April and May , western disturbances , with their cooling influence , may still arrive , but rapidly diminish in frequency as summer progresses . Notably , a higher frequency of such disturbances in April correlates with a delayed monsoon onset ( thus extending summer ) in northwest India . In eastern India , monsoon onset dates have been steadily advancing over the past several decades , resulting in shorter summers there . 
 Altitude affects the temperature to a large extent , with higher parts of the Deccan Plateau and other areas being relatively cooler . Hill stations , such as Ootacamund ( " Ooty " ) in the Western Ghats and Kalimpong in the eastern Himalayas , with average maximum temperatures of around 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) , offer some respite from the heat . At lower elevations , in parts of northern and western India , a strong , hot , and dry wind known as the <unk> in from the west during the daytime ; with very high temperatures , in some cases up to around 45 ° C ( 113 ° F ) ; it can cause fatal cases of sunstroke . Tornadoes may also occur , concentrated in a corridor stretching from northeastern India towards Pakistan . They are rare , however ; only several dozen have been reported since 1835 . 
 = = = Monsoon = = = 
 The southwest summer monsoon , a four @-@ month period when massive convective thunderstorms dominate India 's weather , is Earth 's most productive wet season . A product of southeast trade winds originating from a high @-@ pressure mass centred over the southern Indian Ocean , the monsoonal torrents supply over 80 % of India 's annual rainfall . Attracted by a low @-@ pressure region centred over South Asia , the mass spawns surface winds that ferry humid air into India from the southwest . These inflows ultimately result from a northward shift of the local jet stream , which itself results from rising summer temperatures over Tibet and the Indian subcontinent . The void left by the jet stream , which switches from a route just south of the Himalayas to one tracking north of Tibet , then attracts warm , humid air . 
 The main factor behind this shift is the high summer temperature difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean . This is accompanied by a seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial intertropical convergence zone ( ITCZ ) , a low @-@ pressure belt of highly unstable weather , northward towards India . This system intensified to its present strength as a result of the Tibetan Plateau 's uplift , which accompanied the Eocene – Oligocene transition event , a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34 – 49 Ma . 
 The southwest monsoon arrives in two branches : the Bay of Bengal branch and the Arabian Sea branch . The latter extends towards a low @-@ pressure area over the Thar Desert and is roughly three times stronger than the Bay of Bengal branch . The monsoon typically breaks over Indian territory by around 25 May , when it lashes the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal . It strikes the Indian mainland around 1 June near the Malabar Coast of Kerala . By 9 June , it reaches Mumbai ; it appears over Delhi by 29 June . The Bay of Bengal branch , which initially tracks the <unk> Coast northeast from Cape Comorin to Orissa , swerves to the northwest towards the Indo @-@ Gangetic Plain . The Arabian Sea branch moves northeast towards the Himalayas . By the first week of July , the entire country experiences monsoon rain ; on average , South India receives more rainfall than North India . However , Northeast India receives the most precipitation . Monsoon clouds begin retreating from North India by the end of August ; it withdraws from Mumbai by 5 October . As India further cools during September , the southwest monsoon weakens . By the end of November , it has left the country . 
 Monsoon rains impact the health of the Indian economy ; as Indian agriculture employs 600 million people and composes 20 % of the national GDP , good monsoons correlate with a booming economy . Weak or failed monsoons ( droughts ) result in widespread agricultural losses and substantially hinder overall economic growth . Yet such rains reduce temperatures and can replenish groundwater tables , rivers . 
 = = = Post @-@ monsoon = = = 
 During the post @-@ monsoon months of October to December , a different monsoon cycle , the northeast ( or " retreating " ) monsoon , brings dry , cool , and dense air masses to large parts of India . Winds spill across the Himalayas and flow to the southwest across the country , resulting in clear , sunny skies . Though the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) and other sources refers to this period as a fourth ( " post @-@ monsoon " ) season , other sources designate only three seasons . Depending on location , this period lasts from October to November , after the southwest monsoon has peaked . Less and less precipitation falls , and vegetation begins to dry out . In most parts of India , this period marks the transition from wet to dry seasonal conditions . Average daily maximum temperatures range between 28 and 34 ° C ( 82 and 93 ° F ) . 
 The northeast monsoon , which begins in September , lasts through the post @-@ monsoon seasons , and only ends in March . It carries winds that have already lost their moisture out to the ocean ( opposite from the summer monsoon ) . They cross India diagonally from northeast to southwest . However , the large indentation made by the Bay of Bengal into India 's eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching Cape Comorin and rest of Tamil Nadu , meaning that the state , and also some parts of Kerala , experience significant precipitation in the post @-@ monsoon and winter periods . However , parts of West Bengal , Orissa , Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and Mumbai also receive minor precipitation from the northeast monsoon .

 Climate @-@ related natural disasters cause massive losses of Indian life and property . Droughts , flash floods , cyclones , avalanches , landslides brought on by torrential rains , and snowstorms pose the greatest threats . Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms , which usually track from north to south ; they cause extensive property damage in North India and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions . Hail is also common in parts of India , causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice and wheat . 
 = = = Floods and landslides = = = 
 In the Lower Himalaya , landslides are common . The young age of the region 's hills result in labile rock formations , which are susceptible to <unk> . Rising population and development pressures , particularly from logging and tourism , cause deforestation . The result , denuded hillsides , exacerbates the severity of landslides , since tree cover impedes the downhill flow of water . Parts of the Western Ghats also suffer from low @-@ intensity landslides . Avalanches occur in Kashmir , Himachal Pradesh , and Sikkim . 
 Floods are the most common natural disaster in India . The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks , often flooding surrounding areas . Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation , the floods can kill thousands and displace millions . Excess , erratic , or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops . Almost all of India is flood @-@ prone , and extreme precipitation events , such as flash floods and torrential rains , have become increasingly common in central India over the past several decades , coinciding with rising temperatures . Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain . 
 = = = Cyclones = = = 
 Tropical cyclones , which are severe storms spun off from the Intertropical Convergence Zone , may affect thousands of Indians living in coastal regions . Tropical cyclogenesis is particularly common in the northern reaches of the Indian Ocean in and around the Bay of Bengal . Cyclones bring with them heavy rains , storm surges , and winds that often cut affected areas off from relief and supplies . In the North Indian Ocean Basin , the cyclone season runs from April to December , with peak activity between May and November . Each year , an average of eight storms with sustained wind speeds greater than 63 km / h ( 39 mph ) form ; of these , two strengthen into true tropical cyclones , which have sustained gusts greater than 117 km / h ( 73 mph ) . On average , a major ( Category 3 or higher ) cyclone develops every other year . 
 During summer , the Bay of Bengal is subject to intense heating , giving rise to humid and unstable air masses that morph into cyclones . The 1737 Calcutta cyclone , the 1970 Bhola cyclone , and the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone rank among the most powerful cyclones to strike India , devastating the coasts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh . Widespread death and property destruction are reported every year in the exposed coastal states of West Bengal , Orissa , Andhra Pradesh , and Tamil Nadu . India 's western coast , bordering the more placid Arabian Sea , experiences cyclones only rarely ; these mainly strike Gujarat and , less frequently , Kerala . 
 Cyclone 05B , a <unk> that struck Orissa on 29 October 1999 , was the deadliest in more than a quarter @-@ century . With peak winds of 160 miles per hour ( 257 km / h ) , it was the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane . Almost two million people were left homeless ; another 20 million people lives were disrupted by the cyclone . Officially , 9 @,@ 803 people died from the storm ; unofficial estimates place the death toll at over 10 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Droughts = = = 
 Indian agriculture is heavily dependent on the monsoon as a source of water . In some parts of India , the failure of the monsoons result in water shortages , resulting in below @-@ average crop yields . This is particularly true of major drought @-@ prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra , northern Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Western Orissa , Gujarat , and Rajasthan . In the past , droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines . These include the Bengal famine of 1770 , in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died ; the 1876 – 1877 famine , in which over five million people died ; the 1899 famine , in which over 4 @.@ 5 million died ; and the Bengal famine of 1943 , in which over five million died from starvation and famine @-@ related illnesses . 
 All such episodes of severe drought correlate with El Niño @-@ Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) events . El Niño @-@ related droughts have also been implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output . Nevertheless , ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean — in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to 3 ° C ( 5 ° F ) — have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation , resulting in unusually wet weather across India . Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell that began in the 1990s . A contrasting phenomenon is that , instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean , an ENSO @-@ related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms ; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia , desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season . This reversed air flow causes India 's droughts . The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought .

A severe heat wave in Orissa in 1998 , resulted in nearly 1300 deaths . Based on observations , heat wave related mortality has increased in India prior to 2005 .

 The average annual precipitation of 11 @,@ 872 millimetres ( 467 in ) in the village of Mawsynram , in the hilly northeastern state of Meghalaya , is the highest recorded in Asia , and possibly on Earth . The village , which sits at an elevation of 1 @,@ 401 metres ( 4 @,@ 596 ft ) , benefits from its proximity to both the Himalayas and the Bay of Bengal . However , since the town of Cherrapunji , 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) to the east , is the nearest town to host a meteorological office — none has ever existed in Mawsynram — it is officially credited as being the world 's wettest place . In recent years the Cherrapunji @-@ Mawsynram region has averaged between 9 @,@ 296 and 10 @,@ 820 millimetres ( 366 and 426 in ) of rain annually , though Cherrapunji has had at least one period of daily rainfall that lasted almost two years . India 's highest recorded one @-@ day rainfall total occurred on 26 July 2005 , when Mumbai received more than 650 mm ( 26 in ) ; the massive flooding that resulted killed over 900 people . 
 = = = Snowfall = = = 
 Remote regions of Jammu and Kashmir such as Baramulla district in the east and the Pir Panjal Range in the southeast experience exceptionally heavy snowfall . In southern areas around Jammu the climate is typically monsoonal , though the region is sufficiently far west to average 40 – 100 mm ( 2 – 4 in ) of rain monthly from January and March . In the hot season , Jammu city is very hot and can reach up to 40 ° C ( 104 ° F ) while in July and August , very heavy — though erratic — rainfall occurs with monthly extremes of up to 650 millimetres ( 26 in ) . Rainfall declines in September ; by October conditions are extremely dry , with temperatures of around 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) . Across from the Pir Panjal range , the South Asian monsoon is no longer a factor and most precipitation falls in the spring from southwestern <unk> . Because of its closeness to the Arabian Sea , Srinagar receives as much as 25 inches ( 635 mm ) of rain from this source , with the wettest months being March to May with around 85 mm ( 3 @.@ 3 inches ) per month . 
 = = = Leh and the Zanskars = = = 
 North of the main Himalaya Range , even the southwestern <unk> break up or founder ; hence the climate of Leh and the Zanskars is extremely dry and cold . Annual precipitation is only around 100 mm ( 4 inches ) per year and humidity is very low . This region is almost entirely above 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 750 ft ) above sea level ; thus winters are extremely cold . In the Zanskars , the average January temperature is − 20 ° C ( − 4 ° F ) with extremes as low as − 40 ° C ( − 40 ° F ) . All rivers freeze over ; locals cross unbridged rivers in winter because summer glacier melt deepens the waters and inhibits fording . Summer in Leh and the Zanskars are a pleasantly warm 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) , but the low humidity and thin air can render nights cold . Kashmir 's highest recorded monthly snowfall occurred in February 1967 , when 8 @.@ 4 metres ( 27 @.@ 6 ft ) fell in Gulmarg , though the IMD has recorded snowdrifts up to 12 metres ( 39 @.@ 4 ft ) in several Kashmiri districts . In February 2005 , more than 200 people died when , in four days , a western disturbance brought up to 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) of snowfall to parts of the state . 
 = = Global warming = = 
 Current sea level rise , increased cyclonic activity , increased ambient temperatures , and increasingly fickle precipitation patterns are effects of global warming that have affected or are projected to impact India . Thousands of people have been displaced by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low @-@ lying islands in the Sundarbans . Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing Himalayan glaciers to retreat , threatening the flow rate of the Ganges , Brahmaputra , Yamuna , and other major rivers ; the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmers depend on these rivers . A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) report states that the Indus River may run dry for the same reason . 
 Severe landslides and floods are projected to become increasingly common in such states as Assam . Ecological disasters , such as a 1998 coral bleaching event that killed off more than 70 % of corals in the reef ecosystems off Lakshadweep and the Andamans and was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied to global warming , are also projected to become increasingly common . Meghalaya and other northeastern states are also concerned that rising sea levels will submerge much of Bangladesh and spawn a refugee crisis . If severe climate changes occurs , Bangladesh and parts of India that border it may lose vast tracts of coastal land . 
 The Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research has reported that , if the predictions relating to global warming made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change come to fruition , climate @-@ related factors could cause India 's GDP to decline by up to 9 % . Contributing to this would be shifting growing seasons for major crops such as rice , production of which could fall by 40 % . Around seven million people are projected to be displaced due to , among other factors , submersion of parts of Mumbai and Chennai if global temperatures were to rise by a mere 2 ° C ( 3 @.@ 6 ° F ) . Such shifts are not new . Earlier in the Holocene epoch ( 4 @,@ 800 – 6 @,@ 300 years ago ) , parts of what is now the Thar Desert were wet enough to support perennial lakes ; researchers have proposed that this was due to much higher winter precipitation , which coincided with stronger monsoons . Kashmir 's erstwhile subtropical climate dramatically cooled 2 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 7 Ma and experienced prolonged cold spells starting 600 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 = = Atmospheric pollution = = 
 Thick haze and smoke originating from burning biomass in northwestern India and air pollution from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin . Prevailing westerlies carry aerosols along the southern margins of the sheer @-@ faced Tibetan Plateau towards eastern India and the Bay of Bengal . Dust and black carbon , which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern margins of the Himalayas , can absorb shortwave radiation and heat the air over the Tibetan Plateau . The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air to warm and <unk> upwards , increasing the concentration of moisture in the mid @-@ troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols . 
 = Ontario Highway 427 = 
 King 's Highway 427 ( pronounced " four twenty @-@ seven " ) , also known as Highway 427 and colloquially as the 427 , is a 400 @-@ series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that connects the Queen Elizabeth Way ( QEW ) and Gardiner Expressway with York Regional Road 7 ( formerly Highway 7 ) via Highway 401 . An arterial extension , known as York Regional Road 99 , continues 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) north to Zenway Boulevard . It is Ontario 's second busiest freeway by volume and third busiest in North America , behind Highway 401 and Interstate 405 in California . Like Highway 401 , a portion of the route is divided into a collector @-@ express system with twelve to fourteen continuous lanes . Notable about Highway 427 are its several multi @-@ level interchanges ; the junctions with QEW and Highway 401 are two of the largest interchanges in Ontario and were constructed between 1967 and 1971 , while the interchanges with Highway 409 and Highway 407 are more recent and were completed in 1992 and 1995 , respectively . 
 Highway 427 is the main feeder to Toronto Pearson International Airport from the north and south . However , while much of the traffic comes from Highway 407 , Highway 401 ( eastbound ) , and the QEW / Gardiner Expressway makes use of the freeway for airport access , it serves the western portion of Toronto ( Etobicoke ) , the northeastern portion of Mississauga ( Malton ) , the southeastern portion of Brampton ( Claireville ) , and the western portion of Vaughan ( Woodbridge ) . The section between Highway 401 and Dundas Street is a heavily traversed transit corridor ; GO Transit , <unk> , and the Toronto Transit Commission ( TTC ) all operate express buses along this section of the highway . 
 First designated in 1972 , Highway 427 follows what was originally a two lane roadway known as Highway 27 , as well as a short freeway north of Highway 401 known as the Airport Expressway . Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s , eventually becoming intertwined into the present configuration in 1972 . The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway 7 over the following twenty years . A short arterial extension was later built , though this section is designated as York Regional Road 99 ( Zenway Boulevard ) . Plans have been announced to extend Highway 427 north to Major Mackenzie Drive with funding beginning in 2017 ; no further timeline has been provided as of 2015 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 427 is the second busiest freeway in Canada with an average of 300 @,@ 000 vehicles that use it between the QEW and Highway 401 per day . The section between Burnhamthorpe Road and Rathburn Road has an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) count of 353 @,@ 100 . The route is 19 @.@ 9 km ( 12 @.@ 4 mi ) long . 
 At its southern terminus , the route begins at <unk> Court , where Brown 's Line becomes Highway 427 . Alderwood Plaza , located on the east side of the route , has a parking lot which provides access to the highway ; this is the only at @-@ grade access along the length of the route . The four lane road splits into a divided highway and descends below Evans Avenue . The highway weaves through a complicated interchange , providing northbound access to Evans Avenue and the Gardiner Expressway , and southbound access to The Queensway , QEW / Gardiner Expressway , and Evans Avenue . North of the interchange , the lanes from Brown 's Line diverge and form the collector lanes of a collector @-@ express system . Flyover ramps to and from the QEW / Gardiner pass over the southbound lanes and converge to form the express lanes . This collector @-@ express system serves to divide local traffic from freeway @-@ to @-@ freeway traffic ; the express lanes provide access between the QEW / Gardiner Expressway and Highway 401 , while the collector lanes provide local access between those interchanges . 
 After crossing Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) tracks , the freeway interchanges with Dundas Street . A set of criss @-@ crossing ramps provide access between the collector and express lanes north of here , referred to as The <unk> . The highway passes beneath Bloor Street West but does not provide direct access . Instead , it provides ramps to parallel arterial roads ; The East Mall and The West Mall run parallel with the freeway from Evans Avenue to Rathburn Road . A full interchange is provided shortly after with Burnhamthorpe Road , southwest of Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute . Across from the college , an offramp provides access from the southbound lanes to Holiday Drive and The West Mall . Following the offramp , to the north , is a partial interchange with Rathburn Road , which provides access from the northbound lanes and to the southbound lanes . 
 Transfers provide a second and final opportunity to cross between express and collector lanes , or vice versa , south of the complicated 1 @.@ 56 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 0 @.@ 60 sq mi ) Highway 401 interchange . A final set of ramps along the collector @-@ express system provides access to and from the southbound lanes and <unk> Drive , after which the collectors diverge , and the express lanes cross the southbound collectors . The collector lanes provide access to and from Eglinton Avenue then transition into Highway 27 , while the express lanes interchange with Highway 401 and continues the route of Highway 427 north . The Highway 427 express lanes and flyover ramps to / from Highway 401 are constructed around the Richview Memorial Cemetery . Highway 427 passes through the sprawling interchange and becomes displaced approximately 1 km ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the west . Despite its size , there are no ramps to provide access from southbound Highway 427 to eastbound Highway 401 and vice versa , as this connection is handled by Highway 409 . Highway 427 crosses Renforth Drive and then curves to the east of Runway 24R and <unk> of Pearson Airport . Shortly thereafter , it crosses and interchanges with Dixon Road and Airport Road , between which it forms the demarcation line . Several ramps diverge at this point to provide access to Pearson Airport , and the freeway narrows to eight lanes . 
 From here to Finch Avenue , the freeway follows the boundary line between Toronto and Mississauga . It encounters the third multi @-@ level junction along its length , with Highway 409 , which provides access to the airport as well as the southbound to eastbound movement that cannot be performed at the interchange with Highway 401 to the south . Highway 427 continues straight north and narrows again to six lanes . After crossing the Kitchener GO line , it passes west of Woodbine Racetrack and beneath <unk> Boulevard , Morning Star Drive , and Finch Avenue West , the first and last interchange with the route . The freeway bends slightly eastward , diverging from the Mississauga – Toronto boundary , and crosses the West Humber River where it drains from Claireville Reservoir . Approaching the fourth and final sprawling interchange , it crosses Steeles Avenue and enters Vaughan . It passes beneath Highway 407 and crosses through an undeveloped area before terminating at its final interchange with Highway 7 . The mainline continues north as a four lane arterial road to Zenway Boulevard and is designated as York Regional Road 99 .

 = = = QEW to Highway 401 = = = 
 Although Highway 427 was not officially designated until 1972 , several sections of freeway were already in place prior to that date . The designation was applied following the completion of the interchanges at the QEW and Highway 401 as well as the expansion of the section between them into a collector @-@ express system . 
 Highway 27 was designated as a two lane road travelling north from Highway 2 ( Lake Shore Boulevard ) towards Barrie . As Toronto grew outwards following the annexation of various municipalities , the Ontario Department of Highways ( DHO ) began planning for a bypass of the city , aptly named the Toronto Bypass . A significant portion of this bypass was designed to be incorporated into the <unk> Highway , now Highway 401 . The remainder was designed to follow the existing right @-@ of @-@ way of Highway 27 between the QEW and Richview Sideroad ( now Eglinton Avenue ) . 
 Construction of the Toronto Bypass began near Yonge Street in 1949 ( along present @-@ day Highway 401 ) and on the four @-@ laning of Highway 27 in 1953 . The Highway 27 work involved the construction of two interchanges : a three @-@ way stack at Highway 401 and a large cloverleaf at the QEW , the latter of which would become one of the worst bottlenecks in the province a decade after its completion , according to Minister of Transportation Charles MacNaughton . By September 1956 , it was possible to bypass Toronto entirely on the four lane divided highway composed of Highway 401 and Highway 27 . Highway 401 was extended to the west soon after , but Highway 27 remained a two lane highway north of it . 
 = = = Airport Expressway 1964 @-@ 1971 = = = 
 During the early 1960s , Toronto International Airport was expanded with the construction of the <unk> One terminal . To serve the expected demand of the expansion , the DHO built a new four lane freeway north from Highway 401 at Renforth Drive . This new route , which roughly followed the same route as Highway 427 as far as Dixon / Airport Road , was known as the Toronto Airport Expressway and was opened on January 3 , 1964 . It featured a connection with the western terminus of Richview Sideroad at the southern end of the interchange with Highway 401 as well as an interchange with Renforth Drive . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 In 1963 , it was announced by MacNaughton that Highway 401 would be widened from a four lane highway to a collector @-@ express system , modelled after the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago . Plans were soon developed to apply this model to the QEW between Highway 27 and Royal York Road and to Highway 27 between the QEW and Highway 401 , and were unveiled to Etobicoke council on October 13 , 1966 . Design work followed and was completed by May 1967 . This reconstruction once again involved the junctions with the QEW and Highway 401 , which were reconfigured into complicated multi @-@ level interchanges to permit free @-@ flow movement ; construction began in September 1968 . The widening of Highway 27 required the demolition and rebuilding of overpasses at Bloor Street , Burnhamthorpe Road and Rathburn Road constructed just over a decade earlier . 
 The junction with the QEW was built over 48 @.@ 5 ha ( 120 acres ) and required the construction of 19 bridges and the equivalent of 42 km ( 26 mi ) of two lane roadway . The junction with Highway 401 sprawls over 156 ha ( 385 acres ) and required the construction of 28 bridges and the equivalent of 46 @.@ 6 km ( 29 mi ) of two lane roadway , the largest interchange in Canada . The former was opened to traffic on November 14 , 1969 , while the latter required several more years of construction staging , fully opening on December 4 , 1971 ( though portions were opened in the weeks prior to that ) , just prior to Highway 27 's renumbering as Highway 427 . The rest of the route was rebuilt prior to the completion of these interchanges . 
 The completed project resulted in the creation of Highway 427 between the QEW and Dixon / Airport Road , north of which traffic was defaulted onto Indian Line . The entire Airport Expressway was removed to make way for the new interchange , but the new route still included direct access to the airport . 
 = = = Extensions beyond Highway 401 = = = 
 Ultimately , it was planned to extend Highway 427 north along Indian Line to the future Highway 407 , where ramps would direct northbound traffic onto Highway 27 . An extension north of Dixon / Airport Road began in 1976 as part of the work to build Highway 409 , and it included the construction of the interchange between the two freeways . By the beginning of 1980 , this work was completed , and construction was progressing on the section north to <unk> Boulevard , which opened by the end of the year . In 1982 , Construction began on the next section of Highway 427 , which would extend it to Albion Road , north of the West Humber River . This project included the extension of Finch Avenue west from Highway 27 to Steeles Avenue West and was completed in late 1984 . 
 As part of the initial phase of Highway 407 , Highway 427 was extended north to Highway 7 in Vaughan and began with the construction of the interchange between the two in 1988 . With the interchange only half @-@ completed , the extension was opened in late 1991 . By 1994 , the final at @-@ grade intersections — one at Morning Star Drive , and another as a left turn to the southbound lanes with eastbound Highway 409 — were replaced , making Highway 427 a fully controlled @-@ access freeway for its entire length . 
 = = Future = = 
 An environmental assessment has been completed on a northward extension of Highway 427 to Major Mackenzie Drive to relieve traffic issues on Highway 7 and provide improved access to the Canadian Pacific Intermodal Terminal . A temporary arterial road extension was opened in the autumn of 2008 by York Region and designated as Regional Road 99 . This road serves to provide improved access to Highway 27 and Highway 50 , but will be removed when construction begins on the freeway extension . Technical designs have been prepared for the approved route as far as Major Mackenzie Drive , but no timeline has been set for construction yet beyond inclusion in the 2017 provincial budget . 
 A section of Highway 427 between Campus Road @-@ <unk> Drive and Steeles Avenue is being expanded to four lanes in each direction as of 2015 . This project includes the installation of high @-@ mast lighting , median barriers , and the addition of an HOV lane in both directions . Completion is scheduled for fall 2017 . 
 On March 3 , 2016 , the Ontario government approved the extension of Highway 427 north towards Major Mackenzie Drive , along with road widening from 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) south of Albion Road to Highway 7 . Construction would start in 2017 , and the extension and widening would be completed by 2020 . In addition , the government will also install high occupancy toll lanes , which will run from south of Highway 409 towards north of Rutherford Road . These toll lanes will be completed in 2021 .

 = Helicobacter pylori = 
 Helicobacter pylori , previously Campylobacter pylori , is a gram @-@ negative , microaerophilic bacterium found usually in the stomach . It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren , who found that it was present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers , conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause . It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer . However , over 80 % of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic , and it may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology . 
 More than 50 % of the world 's population harbor H. pylori in their upper gastrointestinal tract . Infection is more prevalent in developing countries , and incidence is decreasing in Western countries . H. pylori 's helical shape ( from which the genus name is derived ) is thought to have evolved to penetrate the mucoid lining of the stomach . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Up to 85 % of people infected with H. pylori never experience symptoms or complications . Acute infection may appear as an acute gastritis with abdominal pain ( stomach ache ) or nausea . Where this develops into chronic gastritis , the symptoms , if present , are often those of non @-@ ulcer dyspepsia : stomach pains , nausea , bloating , belching , and sometimes vomiting or black stool . 
 Individuals infected with H. pylori have a 10 to 20 % lifetime risk of developing peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2 % risk of acquiring stomach cancer . Inflammation of the pyloric antrum is more likely to lead to duodenal ulcers , while inflammation of the corpus ( body of the stomach ) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma . However , H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation , but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis . A meta @-@ analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals , suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65 % for gastric cancers ; in terms of absolute risk , the increase was from 1 @.@ 1 % to 1 @.@ 7 % . 
 H. pylori has been associated with colorectal polyps and colorectal cancer . It may also be associated with eye disease . 
 = = Microbiology = = 
 H. pylori is a helix @-@ shaped ( classified as a curved rod , not spirochaete ) Gram @-@ negative bacterium about 3 μm long with a diameter of about 0 @.@ 5 μm . It is microaerophilic ; that is , it requires oxygen , but at lower concentration than is found in the atmosphere . It contains a <unk> which can be used to obtain energy by oxidizing molecular hydrogen ( H2 ) produced by intestinal bacteria . It produces oxidase , catalase , and urease . It is capable of forming biofilms and can convert from spiral to a possibly viable but <unk> <unk> form , both likely to favor its survival and be factors in the epidemiology of the bacterium . 
 H. pylori possesses five major outer membrane protein families . The largest family includes known and putative <unk> . The other four families are porins , iron transporters , flagellum @-@ associated proteins , and proteins of unknown function . Like other typical Gram @-@ negative bacteria , the outer membrane of H. pylori consists of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide ( <unk> ) . The O antigen of <unk> may be <unk> and mimic Lewis blood group antigens found on the gastric epithelium . The outer membrane also contains cholesterol glucosides , which are found in few other bacteria . H. pylori has four to six <unk> flagella ; all gastric and enterohepatic Helicobacter species are highly motile owing to flagella . The characteristic sheathed flagellar filaments of Helicobacter are composed of two <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = = Microscopy = = = 
 H. pylori can be demonstrated in tissue by Gram stain , Giemsa stain , <unk> @-@ <unk> stain , <unk> @-@ Starry silver stain , <unk> @-@ orange stain , and phase @-@ contrast microscopy . 
 = = = Genome = = = 
 H. pylori consists of a large diversity of strains , and the genomes of three have been completely sequenced . The genome of the strain " <unk> " consists of about 1 @.@ 7 million base pairs , with some 1 @,@ 576 genes . The two sequenced strains show large genetic differences , with up to 6 % of the nucleotides differing . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In 2010 , Sharma et al. presented a comprehensive analysis of transcription at single @-@ nucleotide resolution by differential RNA @-@ seq which confirmed the known acid induction of major virulence loci such as the urease ( ure ) operon or the cag pathogenicity island ( see below ) . More importantly , this study identified a total of 1 @,@ 907 transcriptional start sites , 337 primary operons , and 126 additional <unk> , and 66 <unk> . Until 2010 , only about 55 transcriptional start sites ( TSSs ) were known in this species . Notably , 27 % of the primary TSSs are also antisense TSSs , indicating that — similar to E. coli — antisense transcription occurs across the entire H. pylori genome . At least one antisense TSS is associated with about 46 % of all open reading frames , including many housekeeping genes . Most ( about 50 % ) of the 5 ' <unk> are 20 – 40 nucleotides ( nt ) in length and support the <unk> motif located about 6 nt ( median distance ) upstream of start codons as the consensus Shine – Dalgarno sequence in H. pylori . 
 = = = = Genes involved in virulence and pathogenesis = = = = 
 Study of the H. pylori genome is centered on attempts to understand pathogenesis , the ability of this organism to cause disease . About 29 % of the loci have a colonization defect when mutated . Two of sequenced strains have an around 40 @-@ kb @-@ long <unk> pathogenicity island ( a common gene sequence believed responsible for pathogenesis ) that contains over 40 genes . This pathogenicity island is usually absent from H. pylori strains isolated from humans who are carriers of H. pylori but remain asymptomatic . 
 The cagA gene codes for one of the major H. pylori virulence proteins . Bacterial strains with the cagA gene are associated with an ability to cause ulcers . The cagA gene codes for a relatively long ( 1186 @-@ amino acid ) protein . The cag pathogenicity island ( PAI ) has about 30 genes , part of which code for a complex type IV secretion system . The low GC @-@ content of the cag PAI relative to the rest of the Helicobacter genome suggests the island was acquired by horizontal transfer from another bacterial species . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 = = = Adaptation to the stomach ’ s acidic environment = = = 
 To avoid the acidic environment of the interior of the stomach ( lumen ) , H. pylori uses its flagella to burrow into the mucus lining of the stomach to reach the epithelial cells underneath , where the pH is more neutral . H. pylori is able to sense the pH gradient in the mucus and move towards the less acidic region ( chemotaxis ) . This also keeps the bacteria from being swept away into the lumen with the bacteria ’ s mucus environment , which is constantly moving from its site of creation at the epithelium to its dissolution at the lumen interface . 
 H. pylori is found in the mucus , on the inner surface of the epithelium , and occasionally inside the epithelial cells themselves . It adheres to the epithelial cells by producing <unk> , which bind to lipids and carbohydrates in the epithelial cell membrane . One such adhesion , <unk> , binds to the Lewis b antigen displayed on the surface of stomach epithelial cells . Another such adhesion , <unk> , binds to increased levels of <unk> @-@ Lewis x antigen expressed on gastric mucosa . 
 In addition to using chemotaxis to avoid areas of low pH , H. pylori also neutralizes the acid in its environment by producing large amounts of urease , which breaks down the urea present in the stomach to carbon dioxide and ammonia . The ammonia , which is basic , then neutralizes stomach acid . 
 = = = Inflammation , gastritis , and ulcer = = = 
 H. pylori harms the stomach and duodenal linings by several mechanisms . The ammonia produced to regulate pH is toxic to epithelial cells , as are biochemicals produced by H. pylori such as proteases , <unk> cytotoxin A ( <unk> ) [ this damages epithelial cells , disrupts tight junctions and causes apoptosis ] , and certain phospholipases . <unk> associated gene CagA can also cause inflammation and is potentially a carcinogen . 
 Colonization of the stomach by H. pylori can result in chronic gastritis , an inflammation of the stomach lining , at the site of infection . Helicobacter cysteine @-@ rich proteins ( <unk> ) , particularly <unk> ( <unk> ) , are known to trigger an immune response , causing inflammation . Chronic gastritis is likely to underlie H. pylori @-@ related diseases . 
 <unk> in the stomach and duodenum result when the consequences of inflammation allow stomach acid and the digestive enzyme pepsin to overwhelm the mechanisms that protect the stomach and duodenal mucous membranes . The location of colonization of H. pylori , which affects the location of the ulcer , depends on the acidity of the stomach . In people producing large amounts of acid , H. pylori colonizes near the pyloric antrum ( exit to the duodenum ) to avoid the acid @-@ secreting parietal cells at the fundus ( near the entrance to the stomach ) . In people producing normal or reduced amounts of acid , H. pylori can also colonize the rest of the stomach . 
 The inflammatory response caused by bacteria colonizing near the pyloric antrum induces G cells in the antrum to secrete the hormone gastrin , which travels through the bloodstream to parietal cells in the fundus . <unk> stimulates the parietal cells to secrete more acid into the stomach lumen , and over time increases the number of parietal cells , as well . The increased acid load damages the duodenum , which may eventually result in ulcers forming in the duodenum . 
 When H. pylori colonizes other areas of the stomach , the inflammatory response can result in atrophy of the stomach lining and eventually ulcers in the stomach . This also may increase the risk of stomach cancer . 
 = = = The cag pathogenicity island = = = 
 The pathogenicity of H. pylori may be increased by genes of the cag pathogenicity island ; about 50 – 70 % of H. pylori strains in Western countries carry it . Western people infected with strains carrying the cag PAI have a stronger inflammatory response in the stomach and are at a greater risk of developing peptic ulcers or stomach cancer than those infected with strains lacking the island . Following attachment of H. pylori to stomach epithelial cells , the type IV secretion system expressed by the cag PAI " injects " the inflammation @-@ inducing agent , peptidoglycan , from their own cell walls into the epithelial cells . The injected peptidoglycan is recognized by the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor ( immune sensor ) <unk> , which then stimulates expression of cytokines that promote inflammation . 
 The type @-@ IV secretion apparatus also injects the cag PAI @-@ encoded protein CagA into the stomach 's epithelial cells , where it disrupts the cytoskeleton , adherence to adjacent cells , intracellular signaling , cell polarity , and other cellular activities . Once inside the cell , the CagA protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by a host cell membrane @-@ associated tyrosine kinase ( TK ) . CagA then allosterically activates protein tyrosine phosphatase / <unk> <unk> . Pathogenic strains of H. pylori have been shown to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , a membrane protein with a TK domain . Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis . A C @-@ terminal region of the CagA protein ( amino acids 873 – 1002 ) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell gene transcription , independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation . A great deal of diversity exists between strains of H. pylori , and the strain with which one is infected is predictive of the outcome . 
 = = = Cancer = = = 
 Two related mechanisms by which H. pylori could promote cancer are under investigation . One mechanism involves the enhanced production of free radicals near H. pylori and an increased rate of host cell mutation . The other proposed mechanism has been called a " <unk> pathway " , and involves enhancement of the transformed host cell phenotype by means of alterations in cell proteins , such as adhesion proteins . H. pylori has been proposed to induce inflammation and locally high levels of TNF @-@ α and / or interleukin 6 ( IL @-@ 6 ) . According to the proposed <unk> mechanism , inflammation @-@ associated signaling molecules , such as TNF @-@ α , can alter gastric epithelial cell adhesion and lead to the dispersion and migration of mutated epithelial cells without the need for additional mutations in tumor suppressor genes , such as genes that code for cell adhesion proteins . 
 The strain of H. pylori to which a person is exposed may influence the risk of developing gastric cancer . Strains of H. pylori that produce high levels of two proteins , <unk> toxin A ( <unk> ) and the cytotoxin @-@ associated gene A ( CagA ) , appear to cause greater tissue damage than those that produce lower levels or that lack those genes completely . These proteins are directly toxic to cells lining the stomach and signal strongly to the immune system that an invasion is underway . As a result of the bacterial presence , neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in the tissue to fight the bacteria assault . 
 = = = Survival of H. pylori = = = 
 The pathogenesis of H. pylori depends on its ability to survive in the harsh gastric environment characterized by acidity , peristalsis , and attack by phagocytes accompanied by release of reactive oxygen species . In particular , H. pylori elicits an oxidative stress response during host colonization . This oxidative stress response induces potentially lethal and mutagenic oxidative DNA adducts in the H. pylori genome . 
 Vulnerability to oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage occurs commonly in many studied bacterial pathogens , including Neisseria gonorrhoeae , <unk> influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , S. mutans , and H. pylori . For each of these pathogens , surviving the DNA damage induced by oxidative stress appears to be supported by transformation @-@ mediated recombinational repair . Thus , transformation and recombinational repair appear to contribute to successful infection . 
 Transformation ( the transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium ) appears to be part of an adaptation for DNA repair . H. pylori is naturally competent for transformation . While many organisms are competent only under certain environmental conditions , such as starvation , H. pylori is competent throughout logarithmic growth . All organisms encode genetic programs for response to stressful conditions including those that cause DNA damage . In H. pylori , homologous recombination is required for repairing DNA double @-@ strand breaks ( DSBs ) . The <unk> helicase @-@ nuclease complex <unk> DSBs and loads RecA onto single @-@ strand DNA ( ssDNA ) , which then mediates strand exchange , leading to homologous recombination and repair . The requirement of RecA plus <unk> for efficient gastric colonization suggests , in the stomach , H. pylori is either exposed to double @-@ strand DNA damage that must be repaired or requires some other recombination @-@ mediated event . In particular , natural transformation is increased by DNA damage in H. pylori , and a connection exists between the DNA damage response and DNA uptake in H. pylori , suggesting natural competence contributes to persistence of H. pylori in its human host and explains the retention of competence in most clinical isolates . 
 RuvC protein is essential to the process of recombinational repair , since it resolves intermediates in this process termed Holliday junctions . H. pylori mutants that are defective in RuvC have increased sensitivity to DNA @-@ damaging agents and to oxidative stress , exhibit reduced survival within macrophages , and are unable to establish successful infection in a mouse model . Similarly , <unk> protein plays an important role in DSB repair in H. pylori . An H. pylori <unk> mutant displays an attenuated ability to colonize mouse stomachs , highlighting the importance of recombinational DNA repair in survival of H. pylori within its host . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Colonization with H. pylori is not a disease in and of itself , but a condition associated with a number of disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract . Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low @-@ grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present , after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer , first @-@ degree relatives h gastric cancer , and in certain cases of dyspepsia , not routinely . Several ways of testing exist . One can test <unk> for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test , stool antigen test , or with the carbon urea breath test ( in which the patient drinks 14C — or 13C @-@ labelled urea , which the bacterium metabolizes , producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath ) . Also , a urine ELISA test with a 96 % sensitivity and 79 % specificity is available . None of the test methods is completely failsafe . Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy . Blood antibody tests , for example , range from 76 % to 84 % sensitivity . Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea @-@ based tests . The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy , combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 H. pylori is a major cause of certain diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract . Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies ; this might include prevention in form of vaccination . Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases , including stomach cancer . Researchers are studying different adjuvants , antigens , and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection ; however , most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials . An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could , at least in the Netherlands , prove cost @-@ effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer . A similar approach has also been studied for the United States . 
 The presence of bacteria in the stomach may be beneficial , reducing the prevalence of asthma , rhinitis , dermatitis , inflammatory bowel disease , gastroesophageal reflux disease , and esophageal cancer by influencing systemic immune responses . 
 Recent evidence suggests that <unk> strains of H. pylori may be beneficial , e.g. , by normalizing stomach acid secretion , and may play a role in regulating appetite , since its presence in the stomach results in a persistent but reversible reduction in the level of ghrelin . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 Once H. pylori is detected in a person with a peptic ulcer , the normal procedure is to eradicate it and allow the ulcer to heal . The standard first @-@ line therapy is a one @-@ week " triple therapy " consisting of proton pump inhibitors such as <unk> and the antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin . Variations of the triple therapy have been developed over the years , such as using a different proton pump inhibitor , as with <unk> or <unk> , or replacing amoxicillin with metronidazole for people who are allergic to penicillin . Such a therapy has revolutionized the treatment of peptic ulcers and has made a cure to the disease possible . Previously , the only option was symptom control using antacids , H2 @-@ antagonists or proton pump inhibitors alone . 
 An increasing number of infected individuals are found to harbor antibiotic @-@ resistant bacteria . This results in initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies , such as a quadruple therapy , which adds a bismuth colloid , such as bismuth subsalicylate . For the treatment of clarithromycin @-@ resistant strains of H. pylori , the use of levofloxacin as part of the therapy has been suggested . 
 Ingesting lactic acid bacteria exerts a suppressive effect on H. pylori infection in both animals and humans , and supplementing with <unk> and <unk> @-@ containing yogurt improved the rates of eradication of H. pylori in humans . Symbiotic butyrate @-@ producing bacteria which are normally present in the intestine are sometimes used as probiotics to help suppress H. pylori infections as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy . <unk> itself is an antimicrobial which destroys the cell envelope of H. pylori by inducing regulatory T cell expression ( specifically , <unk> ) and synthesis of an antimicrobial peptide called LL @-@ 37 , which arises through its action as a histone deacetylase inhibitor . 
 The substance <unk> , which occurs in broccoli and cauliflower , has been proposed as a treatment . Periodontal therapy or scaling and root planing has also been suggested as an additional treatment . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 H. pylori colonizes the stomach and induces chronic gastritis , a long @-@ lasting inflammation of the stomach . The bacterium persists in the stomach for decades in most people . Most individuals infected by H. pylori will never experience clinical symptoms despite having chronic gastritis . About 10 – 20 % of those colonized by H. pylori will ultimately develop gastric and duodenal ulcers . H. pylori infection is also associated with a 1 – 2 % lifetime risk of stomach cancer and a less than 1 % risk of gastric MALT lymphoma . 
 In the absence of treatment , H. pylori infection — once established in its gastric niche — is widely believed to persist for life . In the elderly , however , infection likely can disappear as the stomach 's mucosa becomes increasingly atrophic and inhospitable to colonization . The proportion of acute infections that persist is not known , but several studies that followed the natural history in populations have reported apparent spontaneous elimination . 
 Mounting evidence suggests H. pylori has an important role in protection from some diseases . The incidence of acid reflux disease , Barrett 's esophagus , and esophageal cancer have been rising dramatically at the same time as H. pylori 's presence decreases . In 1996 , Martin J. <unk> advanced the hypothesis that H. pylori has a beneficial effect : by regulating the acidity of the stomach contents . The hypothesis is not universally accepted as several randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate worsening of acid reflux disease symptoms following eradication of H. pylori . Nevertheless , <unk> has reasserted his view that H. pylori is a member of the normal flora of the stomach . He postulates that the changes in gastric physiology caused by the loss of H. pylori account for the recent increase in incidence of several diseases , including type 2 diabetes , obesity , and asthma . His group has recently shown that H. pylori colonization is associated with a lower incidence of childhood asthma . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 At least half the world 's population is infected by the bacterium , making it the most widespread infection in the world . Actual infection rates vary from nation to nation ; the developing world has much higher infection rates than the West ( Western Europe , North America , Australasia ) , where rates are estimated to be around 25 % . The age at which this bacterium is acquired seems to influence the possible pathologic outcome of the infection ; people infected with it at an early age are likely to develop more intense inflammation that may be followed by atrophic gastritis with a higher subsequent risk of gastric ulcer , gastric cancer , or both . Acquisition at an older age brings different gastric changes more likely to lead to duodenal ulcer . Infections are usually acquired in early childhood in all countries . However , the infection rate of children in developing nations is higher than in industrialized nations , probably due to poor sanitary conditions , perhaps combined with lower antibiotics usage for unrelated pathologies . In developed nations , it is currently uncommon to find infected children , but the percentage of infected people increases with age , with about 50 % infected for those over the age of 60 compared with around 10 % between 18 and 30 years . The higher prevalence among the elderly reflects higher infection rates in the past when the individuals were children rather than more recent infection at a later age of the individual . In the United States , prevalence appears to be higher in African @-@ American and Hispanic populations , most likely due to socioeconomic factors . The lower rate of infection in the West is largely attributed to higher hygiene standards and widespread use of antibiotics . Despite high rates of infection in certain areas of the world , the overall frequency of H. pylori infection is declining . However , antibiotic resistance is appearing in H. pylori ; many <unk> and clarithromycin @-@ resistant strains are found in most parts of the world . 
 H. pylori is contagious , although the exact route of transmission is not known . Person @-@ to @-@ person transmission by either the oral @-@ oral or fecal @-@ oral route is most likely . Consistent with these transmission routes , the bacteria have been isolated from feces , saliva , and dental plaque of some infected people . Findings suggest H. pylori is more easily transmitted by gastric mucus than saliva . Transmission occurs mainly within families in developed nations , yet can also be acquired from the community in developing countries . H. pylori may also be transmitted orally by means of fecal matter through the ingestion of waste @-@ tainted water , so a hygienic environment could help decrease the risk of H. pylori infection . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 H. pylori migrated out of Africa along with its human host circa 60 @,@ 000 years ago . Its subsequent evolution created seven prototypes — Europe ( isolated from Europe , the Middle East , India , and Iran ) , NE Africa ( from northeast Africa ) , <unk> ( from countries in Western Africa and South Africa ) , <unk> ( from South Africa ) , <unk> ( from Northern India and among isolates from Bangladesh , Thailand , and Malaysia ) , <unk> ( from Australian Aboriginals and Papua New Guineans ) and East Asia with the subpopulations E Asia ( from East Asians ) , Maori ( from Taiwanese Aboriginals , Melanesians and Polynesians ) and <unk> ( Native Americans ) . The precursors of these prototypes have been named ancestral <unk> , ancestral <unk> , ancestral East Asia , ancestral <unk> , ancestral <unk> , and ancestral <unk> . These ancestral prototypes appear to have originated in Africa and Central and East Asia . European and African strains were introduced into the Americas along with its colonisation — both thousands of years ago and more recently in the slave trade . 
 Recent research states that genetic diversity in H. pylori , like that of its host , decreases with geographic distance from East Africa . Using the genetic diversity data , researchers have created simulations that indicate the bacteria seem to have spread from East Africa around 58 @,@ 000 years ago . Their results indicate modern humans were already infected by H. pylori before their migrations out of Africa , and it has remained associated with human hosts since that time . 
 = = History = = 
 H. pylori was first discovered in the stomachs of patients with gastritis and ulcers in 1982 by Drs. Barry Marshall and Robin Warren of Perth , Australia . At the time , the conventional thinking was that no bacterium could live in the acid environment of the human stomach . In recognition of their discovery , Marshall and Warren were awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . 
 Before the research of Marshall and Warren , German scientists found spiral @-@ shaped bacteria in the lining of the human stomach in 1875 , but they were unable to culture them , and the results were eventually forgotten . The Italian researcher Giulio <unk> described similarly shaped bacteria living in the acidic environment of the stomach of dogs in 1893 . Professor Walery Jaworski of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków investigated sediments of gastric washings obtained by lavage from humans in 1899 . Among some rod @-@ like bacteria , he also found bacteria with a characteristic spiral shape , which he called Vibrio <unk> . He was the first to suggest a possible role of this organism in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases . His work was included in the Handbook of Gastric Diseases , but it had little impact , as it was written in Polish . Several small studies conducted in the early 20th century demonstrated the presence of curved rods in the stomachs of many people with peptic ulcers and stomach cancers . Interest in the bacteria waned , however , when an American study published in 1954 failed to observe the bacteria in 1180 stomach biopsies . 
 Interest in understanding the role of bacteria in stomach diseases was rekindled in the 1970s , with the visualization of bacteria in the stomachs of people with gastric ulcers . The bacteria had also been observed in 1979 , by Robin Warren , who researched it further with Barry Marshall from 1981 . After unsuccessful attempts at culturing the bacteria from the stomach , they finally succeeded in visualizing colonies in 1982 , when they unintentionally left their Petri dishes incubating for five days over the Easter weekend . In their original paper , Warren and Marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by bacterial infection and not by stress or spicy food , as had been assumed before . 
 Some skepticism was expressed initially , but within a few years multiple research groups had verified the association of H. pylori with gastritis and , to a lesser extent , ulcers . To demonstrate H. pylori caused gastritis and was not merely a bystander , Marshall drank a beaker of H. pylori culture . He became ill with nausea and vomiting several days later . An endoscopy 10 days after inoculation revealed signs of gastritis and the presence of H. pylori . These results suggested H. pylori was the causative agent . Marshall and Warren went on to demonstrate antibiotics are effective in the treatment of many cases of gastritis . In 1987 , the Sydney gastroenterologist Thomas <unk> invented the first triple therapy for the treatment of duodenal ulcers . In 1994 , the National Institutes of Health stated most recurrent duodenal and gastric ulcers were caused by H. pylori , and recommended antibiotics be included in the treatment regimen . 
 The bacterium was initially named Campylobacter <unk> , then renamed C. pylori ( pylori being the genitive of pylorus , the circular opening leading from the stomach into the duodenum , from the Ancient Greek word <unk> , which means gatekeeper . ) . When 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and other research showed in 1989 that the bacterium did not belong in the genus Campylobacter , it was placed in its own genus , Helicobacter from the ancient Greek <unk> / <unk> " spiral " or " coil " . 
 In October 1987 , a group of experts met in Copenhagen to found the European Helicobacter Study Group ( <unk> ) , an international multidisciplinary research group and the only institution focused on H. pylori . The Group is involved with the Annual International Workshop on Helicobacter and Related Bacteria , the Maastricht Consensus Reports ( European Consensus on the management of H. pylori ) , and other educational and research projects , including two international long @-@ term projects : 
 European Registry on H. pylori Management ( Hp @-@ <unk> ) – a database systematically registering the routine clinical practice of European <unk> 
 Optimal H. pylori management in primary care ( <unk> ) – a long @-@ term educational project aiming to disseminate the evidence based recommendations of the Maastricht IV Consensus to primary care physicians in Europe , funded by an educational grant from United European Gastroenterology 
 = Tropical Depression Five @-@ E ( 2008 ) = 
 Tropical Depression Five @-@ E was a tropical depression which made landfall along the south @-@ western Mexican coastline in July 2008 . It was the fifth tropical cyclone of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season . The depression developed out of a weak tropical wave which formed off the coast of Africa on June 23 . The wave remained poorly organized throughout its journey through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea . The wave entered the Eastern Pacific on July 2 after passing through Central America . The wave developed into an area of low pressure that afternoon . 
 The low moved towards the northwest , paralleling the coastline . Continued development led to the eventual upgrade of the low to Tropical Depression Five @-@ E on July 5 . It was initially thought that the depression would become a tropical storm before landfall but the winds failed to increase above 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . The depression made a turn towards the north @-@ northwest and made landfall on July 7 . It dissipated shortly after landfall due to the mountainous terrain . The depression produced heavy rainfall in parts of southwestern Mexico , peaking at 12 @.@ 99 in ( 330 mm ) . These rains triggered flooding that killed two people and left roughly MXN 30 million ( $ 2 @.@ 2 million ) in damages . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Tropical Depression Five @-@ E formed out of a weak tropical wave , associated with scattered convection , which formed off the coast of Africa on June 23 . The wave was moving towards the west at the rate of 23 mph ( 37 km / h ) , due to an area of high pressure located over the north @-@ central Atlantic Ocean leading to a prevailing easterly flow . Some cyclonic turning was noted and convection was on either side of the axis — the center of the storm — but was mainly in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) . The wave remained very close to the intertropical convergence zone for the next several days without any further development . 
 On June 26 , a small burst of moisture in the system was noted in the area of the wave , but no other notable development occurred . On July 2 , the wave moved over Central America and produced scattered areas of strong convection off the coast of Honduras . Later in the day , the center of the wave became elongated as determined by a QuikSCAT satellite pass . By the afternoon , the wave developed into an area of low pressure and a tropical cyclone formation alert was issued as the possibility of a tropical cyclone developing within 48 hours was present . 
 Not long after the alert was issued , deep convection disappeared from the low while located 400 mi ( 645 km ) . Convection was anticipated to redeveloped later that night or early the next morning . The low was moving slowly towards the northwest due to a deep trough located over the Gulf of Mexico and a ridge of high pressure located over western Mexico . By the morning of July 3 , convection had redeveloped near the low and its forward motion quickly increased to 11 mph ( 18 km / h ) . The low remained disorganized for the next two days as it steadily moved towards the northwest . 
 During the morning of July 5 , deep convection rapidly increased and banding features formed despite strong easterly wind shear . The convection persisted into the afternoon and the low was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five @-@ E accordingly . Weak steering currents persisted as the depression moved towards the northwest at 4 mph ( 6 km / h ) to 5 mph ( 8 km / h ) .

 As Tropical Depression Five @-@ E approached Mexico , the country 's government released tropical storm watches and warnings for certain parts of the coastline . When the tropical depression formed on July 5 , the government issued a tropical storm warning from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo . Other interests in the Pacific Ocean were asked to keep an eye on the developing depression . The morning of July 6 , the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo . The earlier tropical storm warning remained in effect , for another six hours , when the warning was demoted into a tropical storm watch . On the afternoon of July 6 , the government discontinued the tropical storm watch up to Acapulco . The remaining tropical storm watch was discontinued on July 7 , after the tropical depression had made landfall and began to weaken . The government 's weather center also released thirteen tropical cyclone bulletins and four warnings for personal caution . 
 The tropical depression produced 5 @.@ 11 inches ( 130 mm ) of rain in Manzanillo , with other locations also experiencing isolated rainfall . Cerro de Ortega , Colima reported 12 @.@ 99 inches ( 330 mm ) of rain in a 24 @-@ hour period . The community of Ometepec reported 7 @.@ 88 inches ( 200 mm ) .

 = The Coral Island = 
 The Coral Island : A Tale of the Pacific Ocean ( 1858 ) is a novel written by Scottish author R. M. Ballantyne . One of the first works of juvenile fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes , the story relates the adventures of three boys marooned on a South Pacific island , the only survivors of a shipwreck . 
 A typical <unk> – a genre of fiction inspired by Daniel Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe – and one of the most popular of its type , the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print . Among the novel 's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity , 19th @-@ century British imperialism in the South Pacific , and the importance of hierarchy and leadership . It was the inspiration for William Golding 's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies ( 1954 ) , which inverted the morality of The Coral Island ; in Ballantyne 's story the children encounter evil , but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them . 
 In the early 20th century , the novel was considered a classic for primary school children in the UK , and in the United States it was a staple of high @-@ school suggested reading lists . Modern critics consider the book 's worldview to be dated and imperialist , but although less popular today , The Coral Island was adapted into a four @-@ part children 's television drama broadcast by ITV in 2000 .

 = = = Biographical background and publication = = = 
 Born in Edinburgh in 1825 , and raised there , Ballantyne was the ninth of ten children and the youngest son . <unk> by his mother and sisters , his only formal education was a brief period at Edinburgh Academy in 1835 – 37 . At the age of 16 he travelled to Canada , where he spent five years working for the Hudson 's Bay Company , trading with the Native Americans for furs . He returned to Scotland in 1847 and for some years worked for the publisher Messrs Constable , first as a clerk and then as a partner in the business . During his time in Canada he had helped to pass the time by writing long letters to his mother – to which he attributed " whatever small amount of facility in composition [ he ] may have acquired " – and began his first book . Ballantyne 's Canadian experiences formed the basis of his first novel , The Young Fur Traders , published in 1856 , the year he decided to become a full @-@ time writer and embarked on the adventure stories for the young with which his name is popularly associated . 
 Ballantyne never visited the coral islands of the South Pacific , relying instead on the accounts of others that were then beginning to emerge in Britain , which he exaggerated for theatrical effect by including " plenty of gore and violence meant to titillate his juvenile readership " . His ignorance of the South Pacific caused him to erroneously describe coconuts as being soft and easily opened ; a stickler for accuracy he resolved that in future , whenever possible , he would write only about things he had personal experience of . Ballantyne wrote The Coral Island while staying in a house on the Burntisland seafront opposite Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth in Fife . According to Ballantyne biographer Eric Quayle he borrowed extensively from an 1852 novel by the American author James F. Bowman , The Island Home . He also borrowed from John Williams ' Narrative of Missionary Enterprises ( 1837 ) , to the extent that cultural historian Rod Edmond has suggested that Ballantyne must have written one chapter of The Coral Island with Williams ' book open in front of him , so similar is the text . Edmond describes the novel as " a fruit cocktail of other writing about the Pacific " , adding that " by modern standards Ballantyne 's plagiarism in The Coral Island is startling " . 
 Although the first edition is dated 1858 it was on sale in bookshops from early December 1857 ; dating books forward was a common practice at the time , especially during the Christmas period , to " preserve their newness " into the new year . The Coral Island is Ballantyne 's second novel , and has never been out of print . He was an exceedingly prolific author who wrote more than 100 books in his 40 @-@ year career . According to professor and author John Rennie Short , Ballantyne had a " deep religious conviction " , and felt it his duty to educate Victorian middle @-@ class boys – his target audience – in " codes of honour , decency , and religiosity " . 
 The first edition of The Coral Island was published by T. Nelson & Sons , who in common with many other publishers of the time had a policy when accepting a manuscript of buying the copyright from the author rather than paying royalties ; as a result , authors generally did not receive any income from the sale of subsequent editions . Ballantyne received between £ 50 and £ 60 , equivalent to about £ 5800 as of 2012 , but when the novel 's popularity became evident and the number of editions increased he tried unsuccessfully to buy back the copyright . He wrote bitterly to Nelsons in 1893 about the copyrights they held on his books while he had earned nothing : " for thirty @-@ eight years [ you have ] reaped the whole profits " . 
 The Coral Island – still considered a classic – was republished by Penguin Books in 1995 , in their Popular Classics series . 
 = = = Literary and historical context = = = 
 Published during the " first golden age of children 's fiction " , The Coral Island began a trend in boys ' fiction by using boys as the main characters , a device now commonplace in the genre . It preserves , according to literary critic Minnie Singh , the moralizing aspects of didactic texts , but does so ( and in this regard it is a " founding text " ) by the " congruence of subject and implied reader " : the story is about boys and written retrospectively as though by a boy , for an audience of boys . 
 According to literary critic Frank Kermode , The Coral Island " could be used as a document in the history of ideas " . A scientific and social background for the novel is found in Darwinism , of the natural and the social kind . For instance , Charles Darwin 's 1842 The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs was one of the best @-@ known contemporary accounts of the growth of coral . Published a year before Darwin 's Origin of Species ( whose ideas were already being circulated and discussed widely ) , The Coral Island reflects the then prevalent view of evolutionary theory ; the Victorian age based its imperialist ideology in part on the idea that evolution had resulted in " white , English superiority that was anchored in the notion of a civilized nation elected by God to rule inferior peoples . " Ballantyne had been reading books by Darwin and by his rival Alfred Russel Wallace ; in later publications he also acknowledged the naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes . The interest in evolutionary theory was reflected in much contemporary popular literature , and social Darwinism was an important factor contributing to the world view of the Victorians and their empire building . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The story is written as a first person narrative from the perspective of 15 @-@ year @-@ old Ralph Rover , one of three boys shipwrecked on the coral reef of a large but uninhabited Polynesian island . Ralph tells the story retrospectively , looking back on his boyhood adventure : " I was a boy when I went through the wonderful adventures herein set down . With the memory of my boyish feelings strong upon me , I present my book specially to boys , in the earnest hope that they may derive valuable information , much pleasure , great profit , and unbounded amusement from its pages . " 
 The account starts briskly ; only four pages are devoted to Ralph 's early life and a further fourteen to his voyage to the Pacific Ocean on board the Arrow . He and his two companions – 18 @-@ year @-@ old Jack Martin and 13 @-@ year @-@ old Peterkin Gay – are the sole survivors of the shipwreck . The narrative is in two parts . The first describes how the boys feed themselves , what they drink , the clothing and shelter they fashion , and how they cope with having to rely on their own resources . The second half of the novel is more action @-@ packed , featuring conflicts with pirates , fighting between the native Polynesians , and the conversion efforts of Christian missionaries . 
 Fruit , fish and wild pigs provide plentiful food , and at first the boys ' life on the island is idyllic . They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions : a broken telescope , an iron @-@ bound oar , and a small axe . Their first contact with other humans comes after several months when they observe two large outrigger canoes in the distance , one pursued by the other . The two groups of Polynesians disembark on the beach and engage in battle ; the victors take fifteen prisoners , and kill and eat one immediately . But when they threaten to kill one of the three women captured , along with two children , the boys intervene to defeat the pursuers , earning them the gratitude of the chief , Tararo . The next morning they prevent another act of cannibalism . The natives leave , and the boys are alone once more . 
 More unwelcome visitors then arrive in the shape of British pirates , who make a living by trading or stealing sandalwood . The three boys hide in a cave , but Ralph is captured when he ventures out to see if the intruders have left , and is taken on board the pirate schooner . He strikes up a friendship with one of the crew , Bloody Bill , and when the ship calls at the island of Emo to trade for more wood Ralph experiences many facets of the island 's culture : the popular sport of surfing , the sacrificing of babies to eel gods , rape , and cannibalism . 
 Rising tensions result in the inhabitants attacking the pirates , leaving only Ralph and Bloody Bill alive . The pair succeed in making their escape in the schooner , but Bill is mortally wounded . He makes a death @-@ bed repentance for his evil life , leaving Ralph to sail back to the Coral Island alone , where he is reunited with his friends . 
 The three boys sail to the island of Mango , where a missionary has converted some of the population to Christianity . There they once again meet Tararo , whose daughter Avatea wishes to become a Christian against her father 's wishes . The boys attempt to take Avatea in a small boat to a nearby island the chief of which has been converted , but en route they are overtaken by one of Tararo 's war canoes and taken prisoner . They are released a month later after the arrival of another missionary , and Tararo 's conversion to Christianity . The " false gods " of Mango are consigned to the flames , and the boys set sail for home , older and wiser . They return as adults for another adventure in Ballantyne 's 1861 novel The Gorilla Hunters , a sequel to The Coral Island . 
 = = Genre and style = = 
 All Ballantyne 's novels are , in his own words , " adventure stories for young folks " , and The Coral Island is no exception . It is a <unk> , a genre of fiction inspired by Daniel Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe ( 1719 ) , one of the most popular of its type , and one of the first works of juvenile fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes . Susan Maher , professor of English , notes that in comparison to Robinson Crusoe such books generally replaced some of the original 's romance with a " pedestrian realism " , exemplified by works such as The Coral Island and Frederick Marryat 's 1841 novel Masterman Ready , or the Wreck of the Pacific . Romance , with its attention to character development , was only restored to the genre of boys ' fiction with Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island argues literary critic Lisa Honaker . The Coral Island , for all its adventure , is greatly occupied with the realism of domestic fiction ( the domain of the realist novel ) ; Ballantyne devotes about a third of the book to descriptions of the boys ' living arrangements . The book exhibits a " light @-@ hearted confidence " in its description of an adventure that was above all fun . As Ralph says in his preface : " If there is any boy or man who loves to be melancholy and morose , and who cannot enter with kindly sympathy into the regions of fun , let me seriously advise him to shut my book and put it away . It is not meant for him . " Professor of English M. Daphne Kutzer has observed that " the swift movement of the story from coastal England to exotic Pacific island is similar to the swift movement from the real world to the fantastic in children 's fantasy " . 
 To a modern reader Ballantyne 's books can seem overly concerned with accounts of flora and fauna , an " ethnographic gloss " intended to suggest that their settings are real places offering adventures to those who can reach them . They can also seem " <unk> pious " , but according to John Rennie Short , the moral tone of Ballantyne 's writing is compensated for by his ability to tell a " cracking good yarn in an accessible and well @-@ fashioned prose style " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The major themes of the novel revolve around the influence of Christianity , the importance of social hierarchies , and the inherent superiority of civilised Europeans over the South Sea islanders ; Martine <unk> , professor of English , considers the novel " a key text mapping out colonial relations in the Victorian period " . The basic subject of the novel is popular and widespread : " castaway children assuming adult responsibilities without adult supervision " , and The Coral Island is considered the classic example of such a book . 
 The supposed civilising influence of missionaries in spreading Christianity among the natives of the South Seas is an important theme of the second half of the story ; as Jack remarks to Peterkin , " all the natives of the South Sea Islands are fierce cannibals , and they have little respect for strangers " . Modern critics view this aspect of the novel less benevolently ; Jerry Phillips , in a 1995 article , sees in The Coral Island the " perfect <unk> [ ation ] " of " the official discourse of 19th century Pacific imperialism " , which he argues was " obsessed with the purity of God , Trade , and the Nation . " 
 The importance of hierarchy and leadership is also a significant element . The overarching hierarchy of race is informed by Victorian concepts , influenced by the new theories of evolution proposed by Darwin and others . In morals and culture , the natives are placed lower on the evolutionary ladder than are Europeans , as is evidenced in the battle over the native woman Avatea , which pits " the forces of civilization versus the forces of cannibalism " . Another hierarchy is seen in the organisation of the boys . Although Jack , Ralph and Peterkin each have a say in how they should organise themselves , ultimately the younger boys defer to Jack , " a natural leader " , particularly in a crisis , forming a natural hierarchy . The pirates also have a hierarchy , but one without democracy , and as a consequence are wiped out . The hierarchy of the natives is imposed by savagery . Ballantyne 's message is that leaders should be respected by those they lead , and govern with their consent . This educational message is especially appropriate considering Ballantyne 's adolescent audience , " the future rulers of the world " . 
 Modern critics find darker undertones in the novel . In an essay published in College English in 2001 , Martine <unk> states that The Coral Island can be thought of as epitomising a move away from " the confidence and optimism of the early Victorian proponents of British imperialism " toward " self @-@ consciousness and anxiety about colonial domination " . She locates this anxiety in what she calls the " rhetoric of excess " that features in the descriptions of cannibalism , and especially in the accounts of Fijian savagery provided by Bloody Bill ( most notably that of the sacrifice of children to the eel gods ) and the missionary , a representative of the London Missionary Society , an " emblematic figure of colonial fiction " . Others have also linked popular boys ' fiction of the period with imperialism ; Joseph Bristow 's Empire Boys ( 1991 ) claimed to see an " ' imperialist manhood , ' which shaped British attitudes towards empire and masculinity . " The novel 's portrayal of Pacific culture and the effects of colonisation are analyzed in studies such as Brian Street 's The Savage in Literature : Representations of ' Primitive ' Society in English Fiction ( 1975 ) and Rod Edmond 's Representing the South Pacific : Colonial Discourse from Cook to Gauguin ( 1998 ) . The domination imposed by " geographical mapping of a territory and policing of its native inhabitants " is an important theme in the novel both specifically and in general , in the topography of the island as mapped by the boys and the South Pacific 's " eventual subjugation and conversion to Christianity " , a topic continued in Stevenson 's Treasure Island . 
 The exploration of the relationship between nature and evangelical Christianity is another typically Victorian theme . Coral connects the two ideas . Literary critic Katharine Anderson explains that coral jewellery , popular in the period , had a " pious significance " . The " enchanted garden " of coral the boys discover at the bottom of their island 's lagoon is suggestive of " missionary encounters with the societies of the Pacific Island " . In Victorian society coral had been given an " evangelical framing " , and the little " coral insect " responsible for building coral reefs mirrored the " child reader 's productive capacity as a fundraiser for the missionary cause " ; literary critic Michelle Elleray discusses numerous children 's books from the early to mid @-@ 19th century , including The Coral Island , in which coral plays such an educational role . 
 The novel 's setting provides the backdrop for a meditation in the style of Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau , who promoted an educational setting in which lessons are provided by direct interactions with the natural world rather than by books and coercive teachers . Singh points out that Rousseau , in Emile , or On Education , promotes the reading and even imitation of Robinson Crusoe ; literary critic Fiona McCulloch argues that the unmediated knowledge the boys gain on their coral island resembles the " direct language for children " Rousseau advocates in Emile . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The Coral Island was an almost instant success , and was translated into almost every European language within fifty years of its publication . It was widely admired by its contemporary readers , although modern critics view the text as featuring " dated colonialist themes and arguably racist undertones " . Ballantyne 's blend of blood @-@ thirsty adventure and pious imperialism appealed not just to his target juvenile audience but also to their parents and teachers . He is today mainly remembered for The Coral Island , to the exclusion of much of his other work . 
 The novel was still considered a classic for English primary school children in the early 20th century . In the United States it was long a staple of suggested reading lists for high @-@ school students ; such a list , discussed in a 1915 article in The English Journal , recommends the novel in the category " Stories for Boys in Easy Style " . A simplified adaptation of the book was recommended in the 1950s for American 12 – 14 year olds . Although mostly neglected by modern scholars and generally considered to be dated in many aspects , in 2006 it was voted one of the top twenty Scottish novels at the 15th International World Wide Web Conference . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Robert Louis Stevenson 's 1882 novel Treasure Island was in part inspired by The Coral Island , which he admired for its " better qualities " , as was J. M. Barrie 's character Peter Pan ; both Stevenson and Barrie had been " fervent boy readers " of the novel . Novelist G. A. Henty was also influenced by Ballantyne 's audience @-@ friendly method of <unk> . 
 William Golding 's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies was written as a counterpoint to ( or even a parody of ) The Coral Island , and Golding makes explicit references to it . At the end of the novel , for instance , one of the naval officers who rescues the children mentions the book , commenting on the hunt for one of their number , Ralph , as a " jolly good show . Like the Coral Island " . Jack also makes an appearance in Lord of the Flies as Jack <unk> , representing the irrational nature of the boys . Indeed , Golding 's three central characters – Ralph , Piggy and Jack – are caricatures of Ballantyne 's heroes . Despite having enjoyed The Coral Island many times as a child , Golding strongly disagreed with the views that it espoused , and in contrast Lord of the Flies depicts the English boys as savages themselves , who forget more than they learn , unlike Ballantyne 's boys . Golding described the relationship between the two books by saying that The Coral Island " rotted to compost " in his mind , and in the compost " a new myth put down roots " . Neither is the idyllic nature of Ballantyne 's coral island to be found on Stevenson 's treasure island , which is unsuitable for settlement " but exists merely as a site from which to excavate treasure , a view consistent with the late @-@ Victorian imperial mission " according to Honaker .

 = Rudolf Wanderone = 
 Rudolf Walter Wanderone Jr . ( January 19 , 1913 – January 15 , 1996 ; originally spelled Wanderon ) was an American professional pocket billiards player , also known as " Minnesota Fats " . Though he never won a major pool tournament as " Fats " , he was perhaps the most publicly recognized pool player in the United States – not only as a player , but also as an entertainer . Wanderone was inducted in 1984 into the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame for his decades @-@ long public promotion of pool . 
 Wanderone began playing at a young age in New York City . As a teenager , he became a traveling pool hustler . Later , in his 30s , he moved to southern Illinois where he met and married his first wife , Evelyn . During World War II , he hustled servicemen in Norfolk , Virginia . With the end of the war , Wanderone returned to Illinois and entered semi @-@ retirement . 
 Wanderone adopted the nickname " Minnesota Fats " from a character in the 1961 film The Hustler , claiming that the character was based upon him . He parlayed the association with the film into his own book deals and television appearances , including a series of matches with rival Willie Mosconi . Later in life , Wanderone divorced Evelyn and moved to Nashville , Tennessee , where he married his second wife , Theresa , with whom he remained until his death . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Rudolf Walter Wanderon Jr. was born in New York City to Rosa and Rudolf Wanderon , Swiss immigrants . He was born in 1913 but sometimes hinted he was born earlier , even as early as 1900 . The surname was later changed to Wanderone . 
 Known as " Rudy " to friends and family , Wanderone started playing pool as a child while living in Washington Heights , Manhattan . In 1923 , he traveled to Europe with his father where he received training from German balkline billiards champion Erich <unk> . His first prominent match was in 1926 when he competed against former nine @-@ ball champion " Cowboy " Weston ( Wanderone won , handily ) . Wanderone left school in the eighth grade and became a traveling pool hustler , spending much of the 1920s playing at a pool hall called Cranfield 's in New York City , where Wanderone received his first nickname after beating another hustler known as " Smart Henry " . The intensity of their competition led Wanderone 's friend , Titanic Thompson , to dub Wanderone " Double @-@ Smart " . By the mid @-@ 1930s , during the Great Depression , Wanderone had become a manager of a pool hall , owned by a friend , in Anacostia , southeast Washington , D.C. He had acquired more notoriety and nicknames , including " Triple @-@ Smart Fats " , " New York Fats " , " Broadway Fats " , and " Chicago Fats " , attracting action from other hustlers , including the then unknown Luther " Wimpy " Lassiter . 
 In 1941 , Wanderone and friend Jimmy <unk> arrived in southern Illinois — major hustling center on a fast track to televised tournament play — and settled in Du <unk> , Illinois , where he continued hustling . Eventually he met Evelyn Inez Graff ; they married two months to the day later , on May 7 , 1941 . Following their wedding , the <unk> settled in Dowell , Illinois . In 1942 , the couple moved to Norfolk , Virginia . Norfolk had become a key mustering point for US soldiers , as well as a shipbuilding center . The growing population led to an enormous interest in gambling ; Wanderone , in partnership with fellow hustler Lassiter , quickly recognized the financial possibilities . Following World War II , however , the action " dried up " soon , and the <unk> returned to Little Egypt . For a period throughout the 1950s , Wanderone entered semi @-@ retirement , making only occasional hustling trips to New York City .

 In 1961 , the film version of Walter Tevis ' novel The Hustler was released . The film tells the story of a pool shark named " Fast Eddie " Felson and his quest to beat the greatest pool player in America , " Minnesota Fats " . World Champion Willie Mosconi served as a technical advisor and trick shot stunt man for the film . Wanderone almost immediately dropped his " New York Fats " nickname , adopted the name " Minnesota Fats " and began spreading the story that the character was based on him . Tevis denied this for the rest of his life . 
 Wanderone 's notoriety as " Minnesota Fats " led to a job as executive vice @-@ president of billiard table manufacturer Rozel Industries , playing exhibition matches and giving demonstrations . Rozel , in 1965 , published Wanderone 's first book : Minnesota " Fats " Book of Billiards . On January 17 , 1965 , he appeared on the television game show What 's My Line , successfully stumping the panel . 
 In 1966 , he wrote his autobiography , The Bank Shot , and Other Great Robberies , with Sports Illustrated journalist , Tom Fox . His first TV game show , Minnesota Fats <unk> the Pros , debuted in 1967 , featuring " Fats " playing against other pro players . 
 In 1967 he completed and published an instructional paperback , Minnesota Fats on Pool , which was reprinted through 1976 in large @-@ quantity editions , then reissued as a hardcover in 1993 , and remains to this day commonly available . 
 The next year , on January 24 , 1968 , Wanderone was a guest on The Joey Bishop Show . By 1970 , Celebrity Billiards with Minnesota Fats , another short @-@ lived TV game show series , featured Wanderone playing against celebrity guests such as Sid Caesar . 
 In a feature film , The Player ( produced in December 1970 , in Baton Rouge , Louisiana ) , Wanderone played himself as " Minnesota Fats " and was featured prominently on the promotional poster . The screenplay was written and directed by Thomas <unk> , also starred pool pro Jack <unk> , and had a limited release in 1971 by International Cinema . That same year Wanderone was a guest on both The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson ( September 21 , 1971 ) , on which he hustled Carson out of US $ 1 , and the British David Frost Show ( October 13 , 1971 ) . His fame as " Fats " had already made it difficult for Wanderone to hustle effectively , so he relied more and more on exhibition games for income . 
 By 1979 , Wanderone was well @-@ known enough to be playing himself as a celebrity guest star on a Season 2 episode of the popular TV detective drama Vega $ , titled " the Usurper " , the episode featured " Fats " and pro Jimmy <unk> playing one another in a game of pool . In 1980 , while visiting a one @-@ mile stretch of St. Louis , Wanderone had to double his order of autographed pictures after he was stopped thirty @-@ seven times . During this trip he was beaten by Michael Boulton 4 out of 10 times in games of pool . 
 = = Rivalry with Willie Mosconi = = 
 Wanderone enjoyed promoting a feud with world champion Mosconi over how to present pool – either as a rough @-@ and @-@ tumble gambling game ( Wanderone ) or as a genteel pastime and art form ( Mosconi ) . Mosconi 's widow , Flora , said of the rivalry , " My husband hated Minnesota Fats because he felt that [ Wanderone ] was always hurting the image of the game instead of helping it . " Wanderone would state smugly , " I may have ' given away ' a few games to deserving competitors , but I have never lost a real money game since I was old enough to spell ' <unk> <unk> ' . " The two competed on Valentine 's Day ( February 14 ) , 1978 in a televised match on ABC 's Wide World of Sports . With almost 11 million viewers , the game was the second @-@ highest rated episode of the show for that year , behind only the Muhammad Ali vs. Leon Spinks rematch . The game was held at New York 's Waldorf Astoria Hotel , and was announced by Howard Cosell . Although Wanderone lost the game , he won the audience with his banter , and with his joking manner . Mosconi on the other hand was reportedly perceived as cold . 
 " Fats " lost a number of rematches to Mosconi in the following years . However , in the nationally @-@ broadcast Resorts International Shoot @-@ Out of October 1984 – Wanderone 's last notable TV appearance – he finally turned the tables on his rival . The event began with a trick shot competition between four players : Wanderone , Mosconi , Steve Mizerak , and Allen Hopkins . 
 Next , Hopkins and Fats played against Mosconi and Mizerak in doubles seven @-@ ball , then nine @-@ ball . Wanderone and Mosconi ultimately played a one @-@ on @-@ one game of seven @-@ ball ; Wanderone won the match . During the exhibition , a very quiet and genteel Mosconi blocked Wanderone 's rough @-@ and @-@ tumble banter by wearing ear plugs ; yet that failed to stop Wanderone from putting on a show for his fans . In an interview , Wanderone was asked about his strategy to defeat Mosconi , and replied that he had thought to himself , " I 'll make [ the 7 ball ] on the break and end it ... then I 'll help carry Willie out on a stretcher . " 
 = = Later life = = 
 The Billiard Congress of America in 1984 inducted Wanderone into its Hall of Fame for " Meritorious Service " in recognition of his contributions to helping popularize the game of pool . In 1984 , Wanderone abandoned his wife , Evelyn ; they divorced a year later . 
 Wanderone moved into the Hermitage Hotel in downtown Nashville , Tennessee in 1985 , remaining there for several years . In 1992 , while undergoing surgery for a knee injury , he suffered a massive heart attack , but survived . In 1993 , he met and married his second wife , Theresa Ward Bell . He lived in Bell 's Nashville house until his death on January 15 , 1996 , four days shy of his 83rd birthday ( although some sources , including The New York Times , erroneously gave the date of his death on January 18 ) . 
 Wanderone had no known children . Singer Etta James said she believed that he was her biological father , having reportedly been told this by her mother , as well as by others who knew her mother and whom James described as " people who were there and should know " . However , there is no published evidence of such a relationship . James and Wanderone are only known to have met once , in 1987 . 
 In her autobiography , Rage to Survive , James recounted their meeting , writing that Wanderone neither confirmed nor denied his paternity . According to James , he told her that he did not recall the details of his life at the time of her conception well enough to know whether he could have been the father . 
 The epitaph on his tombstone reads : " Beat every living creature on Earth . ' St. Peter , rack ' em up . – Fats ' " . 
 = = Personal character = = 
 Wanderone was known for ostentation , self @-@ aggrandizement , tall tales , fast @-@ talk , and entertaining banter . He was even publicly recognized by famed boaster Muhammad Ali as better at boasting . His critical biographer , R. A. Dyer , documents that Wanderone completely fabricated a " here @-@ by @-@ fate " tale about a car wreck which brought the player to Little Egypt ; it was a tale that Wanderone encouraged to spread and further embellished in his autobiography , to lend an air of the mystical to his public persona . He made false claims about beating Willie Mosconi so frequently that Mosconi filed a slander lawsuit , to little avail . 
 According to Dyer , Wanderone was notorious for non @-@ stop chatter on subjects about which he knew little , or stories about himself . At the beginning of his first TV match against Mosconi , Wanderone claimed " I 've never lost [ a game ] for money in my life ; beat everyone that ever lived . " Yet , as Dyer concedes , " Pool hustlers are , by nature , liars . And by this measure , Minnesota Fats was just a very , very good pool hustler . " 
 Wanderone was a lover of animals , and was reported to have had dozens of cats and dogs simultaneously , and to have devoted a lot of time to finding homes for strays . " I 'm crazy about every living creature " , he wrote in The Bank Shot . " It doesn 't matter what it happens to be . I even love insects ; in fact , I wouldn 't swat a fly or a mosquito for a whole barrel of gold . " 
 Remembered well for his turns of phrase and his puns , Wanderone once wrote , " If you happened to drive from Mobile to Dowell [ Illinois ] with a carload of pool hustlers , you would get bit so hard and so often that you would need a malaria vaccine and a new bankroll as well " , a reference not only to the area 's notorious mosquitos but also the predatory nature of hustlers . Wanderone is remembered for saying on his way out a pool room door , " Boys , the only difference between me and everybody else is that everybody else drives around in a Volkswagen , and Minnesota Fats drives around in a Duesenberg . " Wanderone would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game , and he was a crowd @-@ pleaser . 
 Wanderone owned various limousines throughout his career . He once toured the country in a colorful Lincoln limo , with his extended moniker painted along the side panels in translucent paint , changing colors as it moved with the reflections from the sun : " Minnesota Fats , King of Pool " . His 1980 Cadillac Fleetwood limo was later in the Nashville auto museum , until the facility closed . 
 Wanderone was notorious for his spontaneous wit . When he was named the " uncrowned king " of pool because he never got actively involved in tournament circles ( due to being too busy hustling ) , his reply : " You judge a king by the size of his wallet and his palace . You can leave the crown in the toilet . "

 " Itchy & Scratchy Land " is the fourth episode of The Simpsons ' sixth season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 2 , 1994 . Wanting a perfect family vacation , the Simpson family visits Itchy & Scratchy Land , dubbed " The <unk> Place On Earth " ( a direct reference to Disneyland 's self @-@ description as " The Happiest Place On Earth " ) . The trip starts out great , but things take a turn for the worse when a horde of Itchy and Scratchy robots go on a murderous rampage . It was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wes Archer . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Bart and Lisa see a commercial for an amusement park named Itchy & Scratchy Land , and immediately want to visit it . Marge has already booked a family vacation to a bird sanctuary , but after revealing that the theme park has a place for adults , Bart and Lisa win their parents over , on the condition that they will not embarrass Marge as on previous holidays . After a long car journey , they reach the Itchy & Scratchy Land parking lot , where they are then flown to the park by a helicopter and told by the pilot that nothing can " possibly " ( he pronounces it " <unk> @-@ <unk> , " then hastily corrects himself ) go wrong . 
 Marge is slightly uneasy with the many references to violence at the park , but has an enjoyable time visiting the various violent attractions , which include a parade filled with Itchy and Scratchy robots . Homer and Marge eventually tire out and spend time away from the kids at the nearby " Parents Island " as Bart and Lisa continue having fun . Bart and Lisa also visit a movie theater , where a documentary about the history of Itchy & Scratchy is being presented , including clips of the old Itchy & Scratchy films " Scratchtasia " and " <unk> " . Although going well , the family 's vacation is ruined when Bart launches a stink bomb into an actor 's Itchy suit and is arrested by park security . When Bart arrives in a cell , he finds Homer , who is in there for kicking another Itchy character " in the butt . " Marge is informed of her son 's and husband 's transgressions through the park 's public address system and is immediately embarrassed . 
 Meanwhile , Professor Frink , chief of the animatronic robots in the park parades , tells the other staff that ( according to chaos theory ) all the Itchy & Scratchy robots will turn on their masters ; this happens seconds after he makes the announcement . Bart and Homer are released and just as Marge is lecturing them , all power is cut and a horde of Itchy and Scratchy robots advance towards them . One of the park staff refuses to let them escape on the helicopter with them due to Homer and Bart 's misdeeds at the park . Homer frantically throws everything he can at them and discovers that the flash of a camera short circuits the robots ' systems . The Simpsons then grab dozens of cameras from a closed gift shop and defeat the entire Itchy & Scratchy army . The family is thanked for saving the park and agree that it was their best vacation ever . Regardless , Marge demands that they never speak of the trip again , as she is still embarrassed by the actions of Homer and Bart. 
 = = Production = = 
 " Itchy & Scratchy Land " , written by the entire writing team but credited to John Swartzwelder , was a very difficult episode to produce . It involved creating an entirely new environment , which meant large amount of writing and all new sets . At the time that the episode was produced , new , more stringent censorship laws had been put in place . As a result , the Fox network tried to stop the writers from including Itchy & Scratchy cartoons in episodes . In response , the writers created this episode , which they decided would be as violent as possible . The network threatened that if the episode was produced , they would cut the Itchy & Scratchy parts out themselves , but relented when showrunner David Mirkin threatened to tell the media . The writers nevertheless promised to try not to overdo the violence and in some scenes the violence was cut . 
 Although the episode was quite difficult to animate , " Itchy & Scratchy Land " was " a dream come true " for the animators , as they enjoyed animating scenes filled with violence .

 Much of Itchy & Scratchy Land parodies Disneyland , such as the electric light parade . Euro Itchy & Scratchy Land is a parody of Disneyland Resort Paris , then known as EuroDisney , which at the time was failing . Several scenes , such as the helicopter ride , the logo visible on the helicopter 's side , and certain story elements parody the Michael Crichton book and film Jurassic Park . Other parts of the episode , such as the park 's claim to be the " theme park of the future , " and the plot of the robots at the park rebelling are based on another Crichton story , Westworld . " Scratchtasia " is a reference to the Sorcerer 's Apprentice segment of the Disney film Fantasia , with several shots and the music parodying it exactly . The parody segment is also one of the few moments in the show where Scratchy actually defeats Itchy ( chopping him up like Mickey Mouse chopped up the Broom from the original Fantasia segment ) , although Itchy immediately retaliates and wins yet again . " <unk> " is a parody of the 1940 Disney film Pinocchio . T.G.I. <unk> 's , " where it 's constantly New Year 's Eve , " is a parody of Pleasure Island , a former nightclub section of Walt Disney World 's Downtown Disney , where New Year 's Eve was celebrated every night at midnight . Hans Moleman being attacked by predatory birds while in the phone booth is a spoof of the 1963 Alfred Hitchcock film The Birds . Walt Disney 's alleged antisemitism is spoofed in the character of Roger Meyers , Sr. in his cartoon Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors . The sound made by the vehicle which takes Bart to the detention facility resembles the one made by the ground shuttles carrying the fighter pilots inside the Rebel Base in Star Wars Episode 4 : A New Hope . Marge 's Amish flashback recalls Peter Weir 's 1985 film Witness , while that involving Homer and Bart unintentionally scaring swimmers on a beach recalls Steven Spielberg 's Jaws . The episode of Itchy and Scratchy that Bart and Lisa watch is called " The Last Traction Hero " , a parody of the 1993 film Last Action Hero . The Simpson Family 's journey to Itchy and Scratchy Land parodies the film , National Lampoon 's Vacation , in such scenes as when Bart asks to stop at a nearby restaurant and Homer replies ' No ' , Homer nearly falling asleep at the wheel , and the rest of the events following until they reach the park .

 Homer sees an advertisement in the newspaper for a free trampoline . He rushes to the address from the advertisement , where Krusty the Clown is giving it away , and brings it home . While Bart and Lisa are thrilled by it , Marge is concerned about the potential dangers . Homer brushes her worries aside ; he has plans of turning their backyard into a theme park , and decides to charge a fee to use the trampoline . Inevitably , however , people start getting hurt , and Homer finally takes Marge 's advice to get rid of the trampoline . After failing at his various attempts to do so , Bart steps in to help Homer . They chain the trampoline to a pole using a bike lock and wait for Snake Jailbird to steal it . 
 Homer and Marge argue later that night . Homer admits that while Marge was right that getting the trampoline was a mistake , he adds that he 's at least willing to go out and try new things while she 's bossy , boring and just nags all the time . Marge , of course , disagrees with this , but after asking Bart and Lisa what they think , she discovers that they agree with their father 's assessment about her . Marge becomes offended that people see her that way and goes to her sisters ' apartment . While at Patty and Selma 's apartment , the twins introduce her to an infomercial featuring self @-@ help guru , Brad Goodman , who can supposedly help people like Marge with their chronic nagging . After Marge encourages Homer to watch a Brad Goodman video with her , she becomes more tolerant and the two start getting along better . After seeing how out of control Bart is , the family goes to see Brad Goodman 's live lecture in the hopes that it will change him . Bart interrupts the lecture , but Brad Goodman encourages the town to follow Bart 's spontaneous attitude . Soon , the whole town starts acting like Bart , who at first enjoys things , but eventually becomes upset by it . Lisa explains that it 's because he 's lost his unique identity as a rebel with everyone else in town acting like him . 
 To celebrate their new @-@ found attitude , the town holds a " Do What You Feel " festival . However , the festival soon goes awry because those responsible for building the stages and maintaining the rides " didn ’ t feel like " doing a thorough job , resulting in a runaway Ferris wheel causing chaos . Arguments begin , as everybody has been encouraged to always say exactly what is on their mind , and a riot soon breaks out . Bart is quickly blamed for starting the whole " do as you feel " trend , even with Reverend Lovejoy pointing out that Brad Goodman was the one who encouraged them to act like Bart in the first place . The town chases after him , prompting Homer to save Bart by driving in a float . Despite the very slow speed of the float , the town gives up the chase and goes to the old mill to get some cider . The Simpson family returns home , where they try to figure out what the lesson of the episode was . Homer claims that Bart should have been a better role model , but Marge comes to Bart 's defense by saying that self @-@ improvement is best left to people who live in big cities . But then Lisa says that self @-@ improvement can be accomplished , but through hard work and not a quick fix . Homer concludes that they 're all fine the way they are and the family starts to watch TV .

 " Bart 's Inner Child " was written by George Meyer and directed by Bob Anderson . It was Anderson 's directorial debut on The Simpsons . Meyer 's inspiration for the episode came from the fact that he was going through therapy at the time and he thought it would be a good idea " to send up these self @-@ help gurus " . 
 Actor Albert Brooks guest starred in the episode as Brad Goodman . It was Brooks ' third appearance on the show after playing Jacques in " Life on the Fast Lane " and Cowboy Bob in " The Call of the Simpsons " . He would later guest star as Hank Scorpio in " You Only Move Twice " , Tab Spangler in " The <unk> Kid " , and Russ Cargill in The Simpsons Movie . Executive producer David Mirkin describes Brooks as " really weird to direct " because " almost every one of his takes is flawless , but each one has different material . He makes up the stuff as he goes . " He uses a combination of the jokes in the script and his own material and because many of his takes are different , it is difficult for the producers to decide which lines to use . Goodman was based on the American self @-@ help author John Bradshaw , who popularized such psychological ideas as the " wounded inner child " and the dysfunctional family . 
 Singer James Brown guest stars as himself . Brown makes an appearance at the " Do What You Feel " festival , during which he sings his 1965 song " I Got You ( I Feel Good ) " . After a bandstand collapses , he proclaims " Hey , wait a minute , hold on here ! This bandstand wasn 't double @-@ bolted ! " He described the experience as " good , clean , and humorous . And we need more of that around . " According to Mirkin , the writers like to give guest stars awkward lines which then sound funny coming from them . They knew Brown would not be " the greatest actor in the world " but still " gave him these incredibly hilarious , stiff lines that killed . " Mirkin described Brown 's line as " horrible " but because of Brown 's reading , " you have something that just sounds perfectly wrong and it makes it funny . " In his book Planet Simpson , Chris Turner describes James Brown 's performance as " hilariously over @-@ the @-@ top " and uses it as an example of how the early seasons of the show would include celebrity cameos and not point out the " enormity of their fame " .

 = Haunting Ground = 
 Haunting Ground , known in Japan as Demento ( <unk> ) , is a survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom for the PlayStation 2 in 2005 . The story follows Fiona Belli , a young girl who wakes up in the dungeon of a castle after being involved in a car accident . She quickly befriends Hewie , a White Shepherd roaming the castle . With his aid , Fiona seeks to escape the castle and unravel the mysteries of it and its inhabitants . The game shares many similarities with Capcom 's earlier survival horror title Clock Tower 3 , and has been described as a spiritual successor to the Clock Tower series . The player controls Fiona as they explore the environment , evade and hide from enemy pursuers , and occasionally fight against the castle 's inhabitants . Hewie is a central part to the gameplay , and accompanies Fiona throughout the game . He can be given orders to explore the environment , attack enemies , and otherwise aid in Fiona 's survival . 
 Haunting Ground was first revealed in September 2004 . Capcom added the dog mechanic during development thinking retailers and players alike would not enjoy a survival horror title with a lone female protagonist . The game was released in April of next year garnering mixed to average reviews . The graphics and presentation were praised , as well as the sexual overtones which were described as " disturbing " and " off @-@ putting . " Hewie was credited for giving the game a unique feel . However , the story was found to be cliché , and some of the gameplay was noted as predictable and dated . Haunting Ground was re @-@ released digitally in Japan for the PlayStation 3 in 2015 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Haunting Ground is a survival horror game with similar gameplay elements to Clock Tower 3 . The player controls Fiona Belli directly and gives commands to her canine companion , Hewie . Fiona can run and perform a backstep maneuver , both of which reduce stamina . She can also crouch down to hide from enemy pursuers . Fiona can kick and tackle enemies as well , but tackling also reduces stamina . Losing too much stamina will result in Fiona becoming exhausted , causing her movements to slow down or possibly stop altogether . Exhaustion can be revived with certain items or with time . Fiona can interact with the environment by checking items , opening doors , and climbing ladders . The player can utilize hiding spots to evade pursuers . Other areas act as retaliation points that allow Fiona to use her environment to counterattack against her enemy , although some of these locations can only be used once . 
 Commanding Hewie is an integral part of Haunting Ground 's gameplay . At the beginning of the game , he won 't be completely friendly and obey all of Fiona 's commands . The player will have to build a friendship and gain his trust in order to survive the game . Hewie can be told to sniff out items , check suspicious areas or items , attack an enemy , or called back to Fiona 's side . The player can praise Hewie by petting and feeding him , both which can heal his vitality . Likewise , he can be scolded when he won 't listen to commands . He can be told to " stand ready " before attacking , which will increase his attack power . 
 Enemies can hear footsteps and other sounds . When Fiona is in a dangerous situation , she may fall into a panic . During panic mode , visibility gets worse , the menu can 't be opened , and she will begin running on her own , tripping and falling into walls . Panic mode will elapse after some time , or certain items can be used to calm her down . If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage , she will slow down and become unable to backstep . If she receives too much damage she can die . Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal . While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie , others are used to damage enemies . Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over . Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms .

 Fiona Belli is an 18 @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently moved to college . While visiting her parents , she is involved in a car accident , and awakens in a cage in the dungeon of a castle . Her memories of the incident are hazy . Noting that the cage that keeps her prisoner has been left unlocked , she steps out , but is startled by a large , fierce animal that runs past her . She quickly begins searching for answers and a way out of the castle . Soon , she befriends the animal that initially frightened her , a White Shepherd named Hewie . As Fiona begins to unravel the mystery in which she finds herself , she learns that she is the carrier of the Azoth , which , for unknown reasons , is sought after by Riccardo , the castle 's keeper . 
 The first enemy Fiona encounters is Debilitas , a large , mentally disabled groundskeeper who thinks of Fiona as one of his dolls . Fiona then makes contact with a mysterious man named Lorenzo , who seems to want to help her escape . He tells her that to do so , she needs a staff from the chapel . However , upon taking the staff , Debilitas corners Fiona and Hewie , forcing a confrontation . After eliminating Debilitas , Fiona soon finds her next enemy , Daniella , the icy maid . Daniella covets Fiona 's ability to smell , taste , touch , feel , and " experience pleasure . " She is especially jealous that Fiona can create life ( via a fertile womb ) . Daniella is defeated when she is impaled with a shard of broken glass from a ceiling window . 
 The third villain is Riccardo , who wields a flintlock pistol . For the majority of the game , Riccardo keeps his face hidden under a hood . Upon revealing himself however , Fiona is shocked to see her dead father 's face . Riccardo reveals that he and her father , Ugo , are clones . He murdered Ugo in the car accident as revenge for leaving the castle and marrying Fiona 's mother . He plans to use Fiona ( by means of her womb and use of her Azoth ) to bring about his own rebirth , so that he may live forever . As they fight atop a water tower , Hewie rescues Fiona by attacking Riccardo , causing him to fall from the summit . 
 The final enemy is Lorenzo , who seemed to be an ally , but who now menaces Fiona in several different forms . Fiona first meets him as an old , crippled man . He tells Fiona that Riccardo was always the problem child , and that he created both Riccardo and Ugo in an attempt to find a body with an Azoth which he could use to gain immortality . Ugo had the Azoth , but left the castle to marry Ayla . Now with Riccardo dead , Lorenzo believes that Fiona is his , so he can take the Azoth she inherited from her father . He chases after Fiona , but she is able to crush him in a rock press . However , she soon encounters a resurrected , youthful Lorenzo ; the life energy he acquired from Riccardo 's body has allowed him mastery over his own aging process . With the help of Hewie , Fiona causes Lorenzo to fall into a pit of lava . At this point , the castle begins to shake and collapse , and Lorenzo returns as a flaming skeleton . He chases Fiona as she heads for the exit , and attempts to block her escape , but as they reach the door , he finally dies , and Fiona and Hewie eventually leave the castle .

 Capcom began development knowing they wanted to make a survival horror game with a lead female character . Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike , they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies . After this change , they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic . On September 24 , 2004 , Capcom debuted Haunting Ground under its Japanese name Demento at the Tokyo Game Show after launching a teaser page on their official website two days prior . While the text was in Japanese only , the English translation of the teaser page read : " One person awakes / Continuation of a nightmare / An unknown place / <unk> with insanity . " Capcom released the game in Japan on April 21 , 2005 , in Europe and Australia on April 29 , 2005 , and in North America on May 10 , 2005 . Critics have described the game as a spiritual successor to the Clock Tower series , although it has never been officially declared as such . 
 In July 2012 , Haunting Ground appeared to be slated for a PlayStation 3 re @-@ release as a " PS2 Classic " , having been rated by the ESRB with Sony Computer Entertainment named as the publisher . On April 21 , 2015 , it was re @-@ released for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Store exclusively in Japan .

 Haunting Ground received " average " reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic . The game 's sexuality was noted as a positive point by critics . IGN wrote , " Haunting Ground 's combination of high @-@ end presentation , disturbing sexuality , and psychological <unk> makes it one of the most interesting games of the last couple of months , " and selected it as the " Game of the Month " for May 2005 . They described it as an " interesting horror experience " that would appeal to " old @-@ school adventure fans " , although they found weakness in the narrative , calling it " clichéd " storytelling . GameSetWatch also felt the sexuality of the game was a positive ; " <unk> Haunting Ground for its copious objectification of women is a facile task , and so is discrediting its storytelling for the gratuitous exposure . Easy , easy , to fetishize a horny maid , a half @-@ naked young blonde in dire straits and at the mercy of grasping , perverted men . But it 's precisely that off @-@ putting sexuality that makes Daniella terrifying , that makes Fiona 's circumstances so explicitly repugnant , that sharpens Haunting Ground 's fear factor to a knife in the gut . " 
 1UP.com praised the graphics , character models and environments , arguing that the game featured " some of the most detailed , lavish 3D environments Capcom has ever produced . " They did however feel the game was dated compared to the newly released Resident Evil 4 , stating it " isn 't without merit , it 's just that the merits are buried deep in an occasionally thrilling , mostly ' been there , done that ' game of indistinct origin . " GamePro stated that " despite a few fresh ideas , Haunting Ground is no classic . The thin story relies too often on cliché and titillation , the villains aren 't terribly frightening , and the gameplay becomes too predictable too quickly . Ultimately , this is Resident Evil Lite with a dog . " Despite this , they praised the cinematic presentation and found the visuals as " stark but appealing . " GameSpot noted that Hewie , despite being well @-@ trained , occasionally did not obey orders , adding realism to the game . They found the relationship between Fiona and Hewie and its gameplay mechanics give Haunting Ground " its own special place in the horror genre " . They believed the gameplay to have flaws , " but if you 're a big horror fan and don 't mind something different , Haunting Ground is worth a look . " Other critics also praised the use of Hewie .

 In a retrospective analysis , Kill Screen 's Zach <unk> compared Haunting Ground 's " psychological landscape " to Dario Argento 's 1977 film Suspiria . He commended the game for making symbolic choices in its design , over more literal and sensible choices , creating a dreamlike atmosphere . The game 's grotesque expressionism was also highlighted . <unk> found that removing the player 's control at critical points highlights Fiona 's subjectivity , with the sounds and images expressing ideas of " violation , transgression , and bodily autonomy . " He also found the drive for the enemies to kill Fiona creates a continuous tension , as its unclear nature lends to an uncomfortable confusion for both Fiona and the player . 
 = Lepidoptera = 
 The Lepidoptera ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ i @-@ DOP @-@ <unk> @-@ ə ) is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies ( both called lepidopterans ) . 180 @,@ 000 species of Lepidoptera are described , in 126 families and 46 superfamilies , 10 % of the total described species of living organisms . It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world , encompassing moths and the three superfamilies of butterflies , skipper butterflies , and moth @-@ butterflies . The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek <unk> ( scale ) and πτερόν ( wing ) . The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution . Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought , and is among the four most <unk> orders , along with the Hymenoptera , Diptera , and Coleoptera . 
 Lepidopteran species are characterized by more than three derived features , some of the most apparent being the scales covering their bodies and wings , and a proboscis . The scales are modified , flattened " hairs " , and give butterflies and moths their extraordinary variety of colors and patterns . Almost all species have some form of membranous wings , except for a few that have reduced wings or are wingless . Like most other insects , butterflies and moths are holometabolous , meaning they undergo complete metamorphosis . Mating and the laying of eggs are carried out by adults , normally near or on host plants for the larvae . The larvae are commonly called caterpillars , and are completely different from their adult moth or butterfly forms , having a cylindrical body with a well @-@ developed head , mandible mouth parts , three pairs of thoracic legs and from none up to five pairs of prolegs . As they grow , these larvae change in appearance , going through a series of stages called instars . Once fully matured , the larva develops into a pupa , referred to as a chrysalis in the case of butterflies and a cocoon in the case of moths . A few butterflies and many moth species spin a silk case or cocoon prior to pupating , while others do not , instead going underground . 
 The Lepidoptera have , over millions of years , evolved a wide range of wing patterns and coloration ranging from drab moths akin to the related order Trichoptera , to the brightly colored and complex @-@ patterned butterflies . Accordingly , this is the most recognized and popular of insect orders with many people involved in the observation , study , collection , rearing of , and commerce in these insects . A person who collects or studies this order is referred to as a <unk> . 
 Butterflies and moths play an important role in the natural ecosystem as pollinators and as food in the food chain ; conversely , their larvae are considered very problematic to vegetation in agriculture , as their main source of food is often live plant matter . In many species , the female may produce from 200 to 600 eggs , while in others , the number may approach 30 @,@ 000 eggs in one day . The caterpillars hatching from these eggs can cause damage to large quantities of crops . Many moth and butterfly species are of economic interest by virtue of their role as pollinators , the silk they produce , or as pest species . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word Lepidoptera comes from the Latin word for " scaly wing " , from the Ancient Greek <unk> ( lepis ) meaning scale and πτερόν ( pteron ) meaning wing . Sometimes , the term Rhopalocera is used to group the species that are butterflies , derived from the Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) and κέρας ( <unk> ) meaning " club " and " horn " , respectively , coming from the shape of the antennae of butterflies . 
 The origins of the common names " butterfly " and " moth " are varied and often obscure . The English word butterfly is from Old English <unk> , with many variations in spelling . Other than that , the origin is unknown , although it could be derived from the pale yellow color of many species ' wings suggesting the color of butter . The species of <unk> are commonly called moths . The origins of the English word moth are more clear , deriving from the Old English <unk> " ( cf . Northumbrian dialect <unk> ) from Common Germanic ( compare Old Norse motti , Dutch mot and German Motte all meaning " moth " ) . Perhaps its origins are related to Old English <unk> meaning " maggot " or from the root of " midge " , which until the 16th century was used mostly to indicate the larva , usually in reference to devouring clothes . 
 The etymological origins of the word " caterpillar " , the larval form of butterflies and moths , are from the early 16th century , from Middle English <unk> , <unk> , probably an alteration of Old North French <unk> : <unk> , cat ( from Latin <unk> ) + <unk> , hairy ( from Latin <unk> ) . 
 = = Distribution and diversity = = 
 The Lepidoptera are among the most successful groups of insects . They are found on all continents , except Antarctica , and inhabit all terrestrial habitats ranging from desert to rainforest , from lowland grasslands to montane plateaus , but almost always associated with higher plants , especially angiosperms ( flowering plants ) . Among the most northern dwelling species of butterflies and moths is the Arctic Apollo ( Parnassius <unk> ) , which is found in the Arctic Circle in northeastern Yakutia , at an altitude of 1500 meters above sea level . In the Himalayas , various Apollo species such as Parnassius <unk> have been recorded to occur up to an altitude of 6 @,@ 000 m above sea level . 
 Some lepidopteran species exhibit symbiotic , <unk> , or parasitic lifestyles , inhabiting the bodies of organisms rather than the environment . <unk> pyralid moth species , called sloth moths , such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , are unusual in that they are exclusively found inhabiting the fur of sloths , mammals found in Central and South America . Two species of <unk> moths have been recorded as feeding on horny tissue and have been bred from the horns of cattle . The larva of <unk> <unk> is an internal parasite of the <unk> Kermes species . Many species have been recorded as breeding in natural materials or refuse such as owl pellets , bat caves , honeycombs or diseased fruit . 
 As of 2007 , there was roughly 174 @,@ 250 lepidopteran species described , with butterflies and skippers estimated to comprise around 17 @,@ 950 , and moths making up the rest . The vast majority of Lepidoptera are to be found in the tropics , but substantial diversity exists on most continents . North America has over 700 species of butterflies and over 11 @,@ 000 species of moths , while about 400 species of butterflies and 14 @,@ 000 species of moths are reported from Australia . The diversity of Lepidoptera in each faunal region has been estimated by John Heppner in 1991 based partly on actual counts from the literature , partly on the card indices in the Natural History Museum ( London ) and the National Museum of Natural History ( Washington ) , and partly on estimates : 
 = = External morphology = = 
 Lepidoptera are morphologically distinguished from other orders principally by the presence of scales on the external parts of the body and appendages , especially the wings . Butterflies and moths vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimeters long , to conspicuous animals with a wingspan greater than 25 centimetres , such as the Monarch butterfly and Atlas moth . Lepidopterans undergo a four @-@ stage lifecycle : egg ; larva or caterpillar ; pupa or chrysalis ; and imago ( plural : imagines ) / adult and show many variations of the basic body structure , which have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution . 
 = = = Head = = = 
 The head is where many sensing organs and the mouth parts are found . Like the adult , the larva also has a toughened , or sclerotized head capsule . Here , two compound eyes , and <unk> , raised spots or clusters of sensory bristles unique to Lepidoptera , occur , though many taxa have lost one or both of these spots . The antennae have a wide variation in form among species and even between different sexes . The antennae of butterflies are usually filiform and shaped like clubs , those of the skippers are hooked , while those of moths have flagellar segments variously enlarged or branched . Some moths have enlarged antennae or ones that are tapered and hooked at the ends . 
 The maxillary galeae are modified and form an elongated proboscis . The proboscis consists of one to five segments , usually kept coiled up under the head by small muscles when it is not being used to suck up nectar from flowers or other liquids . Some basal moths still have mandibles , or separate moving jaws , like their ancestors , and these form the family Micropterigidae . 
 The larvae , called caterpillars , have a toughened head capsule . Caterpillars lack the proboscis and have separate chewing mouthparts . These mouthparts , called mandibles , are used to chew up the plant matter that the larvae eat . The lower jaw , or labium , is weak , but may carry a spinneret , an organ used to create silk . The head is made of large lateral lobes , each having an ellipse of up to six simple eyes . 
 = = = Thorax = = = 
 The thorax is made of three fused segments , the prothorax , mesothorax , and metathorax , each with a pair of legs . The first segment contains the first pair of legs . In some males of the butterfly family Nymphalidae , the fore legs are greatly reduced and are not used for walking or perching . The three pairs of legs are covered with scales . Lepidoptera also have olfactory organs on their feet , which aid the butterfly in " tasting " or " smelling " out its food . In the larval form there are 3 pairs of true legs , with up to 11 pairs of abdominal legs ( usually eight ) and <unk> , called apical crochets . 
 The two pairs of wings are found on the middle and third segments , or mesothorax and metathorax , respectively . In the more recent genera , the wings of the second segment are much more pronounced , although some more primitive forms have similarly sized wings of both segments . The wings are covered in scales arranged like shingles , which form an extraordinary variety of colors and patterns . The mesothorax is designed to have more powerful muscles to propel the moth or butterfly through the air , with the wing of this segment ( fore wing ) having a stronger vein structure . The largest superfamily , the Noctuidae , has their wings modified to act as tympanal or hearing organs . 
 The caterpillar has an elongated , soft body that may have hair @-@ like or other projections , three pairs of true legs , with none to 11 pairs of abdominal legs ( usually eight ) and <unk> , called apical crochets . The thorax usually has a pair of legs on each segment . The thorax is also lined with many spiracles on both the mesothorax and metathorax , except for a few aquatic species , which instead have a form of gills . 
 = = = Abdomen = = = 
 The abdomen , which is less sclerotized than the thorax , consists of 10 segments with membranes in between , allowing for articulated movement . The sternum , on the first segment , is small in some families and is completely absent in others . The last two or three segments form the external parts of the species ' sex organs . The genitalia of Lepidoptera are highly varied and are often the only means of differentiating between species . Male genitals include a <unk> , which is usually large , as it is used to grasp the female during mating . Female genitalia include three distinct sections . 
 The females of basal moths have only one sex organ , which is used for copulation and as an ovipositor , or egg @-@ laying organ . About 98 % of moth species have a separate organ for mating , and an external duct that carries the sperm from the male . 
 The abdomen of the caterpillar has four pairs of prolegs , normally located on the third to sixth segments of the abdomen , and a separate pair of prolegs by the anus , which have a pair of tiny hooks called <unk> . These aid in gripping and walking , especially in species that lack many prolegs ( e. g. larvae of Geometridae ) . In some basal moths , these prolegs may be on every segment of the body , while prolegs may be lost completely in other groups , which are more adapted to boring and living in sand ( e. g . , <unk> and Nepticulidae , respectively ) . 
 = = = Scales = = = 
 The wings , head , and parts of the thorax and abdomen of Lepidoptera are covered with minute scales , a feature from which the order derives its name . Most scales are lamellar , or blade @-@ like and attached with a pedicel , while other forms may be hair @-@ like or specialized as secondary sexual characteristics . 
 The lumen or surface of the lamella has a complex structure . It gives color either by colored pigments it contains , or through structural coloration with mechanisms that include photonic crystals and diffraction gratings . 
 Scales function in insulation , thermoregulation , producing pheromones ( in males only ) , and aiding gliding flight , but the most important is the large diversity of vivid or indistinct patterns they provide , which help the organism protect itself by camouflage or mimicry , and which act as signals to other animals including rivals and potential mates . 
 = = Internal morphology = = 
 = = = Reproductive system = = = 
 In the reproductive system of butterflies and moths , the male genitalia are complex and unclear . In females the three types of genitalia are based on the relating taxa : ' monotrysian ' , ' exoporian ' , and ' ditrysian ' . In the monotrysian type is an opening on the fused segments of the sterna 9 and 10 , which act as insemination and oviposition . In the exoporian type ( in <unk> and <unk> ) are two separate places for insemination and oviposition , both occurring on the same sterna as the monotrysian type , i.e. 9 and 10 . The ditrysian groups have an internal duct that carries sperm , with separate openings for copulation and egg @-@ laying . In most species , the genitalia are flanked by two soft lobes , although they may be specialized and sclerotized in some species for ovipositing in area such as crevices and inside plant tissue . Hormones and the glands that produce them run the development of butterflies and moths as they go through their lifecycles , called the endocrine system . The first insect hormone <unk> hormone ( PTTH ) operates the species lifecycle and diapause . This hormone is produced by corpora <unk> and corpora cardiaca , where it is also stored . Some glands are specialized to perform certain task such as producing silk or producing saliva in the palpi . While the corpora cardiaca produce PTTH , the corpora <unk> also produces juvenile hormones , and the <unk> glands produce moulting hormones . 
 = = = Digestive system = = = 
 In the digestive system , the anterior region of the foregut has been modified to form a pharyngeal sucking pump as they need it for the food they eat , which are for the most part liquids . An esophagus follows and leads to the posterior of the pharynx and in some species forms a form of crop . The midgut is short and straight , with the hindgut being longer and coiled . Ancestors of lepidopteran species , stemming from Hymenoptera , had midgut ceca , although this is lost in current butterflies and moths . Instead , all the digestive enzymes , other than initial digestion , are immobilized at the surface of the midgut cells . In larvae , long @-@ necked and stalked goblet cells are found in the anterior and posterior midgut regions , respectively . In insects , the goblet cells excrete positive potassium ions , which are absorbed from leaves ingested by the larvae . Most butterflies and moths display the usual digestive cycle , but species with different diets require adaptations to meet these new demands . 
 = = = Circulatory system = = = 
 In the circulatory system , hemolymph , or insect blood , is used to circulate heat in a form of thermoregulation , where muscles contraction produces heat , which is transferred to the rest of the body when conditions are unfavorable . In lepidopteran species , hemolymph is circulated through the veins in the wings by some form of pulsating organ , either by the heart or by the intake of air into the trachea . 
 = = = Respiratory system = = = 
 Air is taken in through spiracles along the sides of the abdomen and thorax supplying the trachea with oxygen as it goes through the lepidopteran 's respiratory system . Three different <unk> supply and diffuse oxygen throughout the species ' bodies . The dorsal tracheae supply oxygen to the dorsal musculature and vessels , while the ventral tracheae supply the ventral musculature and nerve cord , and the visceral tracheae supply the guts , fat bodies , and gonads . 
 = = Polymorphism = = 
 Polymorphism is the appearance of forms or " morphs " , which differ in color and number of attributes within a single species . In Lepidoptera , polymorphism can be seen not only between individuals in a population , but also between the sexes as sexual dimorphism , between geographically separated populations in geographical polymorphism , and between generations flying at different seasons of the year ( seasonal polymorphism or <unk> ) . In some species , the polymorphism is limited to one sex , typically the female . This often includes the phenomenon of mimicry when mimetic morphs fly alongside <unk> morphs in a population of a particular species . Polymorphism occurs both at specific level with heritable variation in the overall morphological design of individuals , as well as in certain specific morphological or physiological traits within a species . 
 Environmental polymorphism , in which traits are not inherited , is often termed as <unk> , which in Lepidoptera is commonly seen in the form of seasonal morphs , especially in the butterfly families of Nymphalidae and Pieridae . An Old World <unk> butterfly , the common grass yellow ( <unk> <unk> ) has a darker summer adult morph , triggered by a long day exceeding 13 hours in duration , while the shorter diurnal period of 12 hours or less induces a paler morph in the <unk> period . <unk> also occurs in caterpillars , an example being the peppered moth , <unk> betularia . 
 Geographical isolation causes a divergence of a species into different morphs . A good example is the Indian white admiral <unk> <unk> , which has five forms , each geographically separated from the other by large mountain ranges . An even more dramatic showcase of geographical polymorphism is the Apollo butterfly ( Parnassius <unk> ) . Because the Apollos live in small local populations , thus having no contact with each other , coupled with their strong <unk> nature and weak migration ability , interbreeding between populations of one species practically does not occur ; by this , they form over 600 different morphs , with the size of spots on the wings of which varies greatly . 
 Sexual dimorphism is the occurrence of differences between males and females in a species . In Lepidoptera , it is widespread and almost completely set by genetic determination . Sexual dimorphism is present in all families of the Papilionoidea and more prominent in the Lycaenidae , Pieridae , and certain taxa of the Nymphalidae . Apart from color variation , which may differ from slight to completely different color @-@ pattern combinations , secondary sexual characteristics may also be present . Different genotypes maintained by natural selection may also be expressed at the same time . <unk> and / or mimetic females occur in the case of some taxa in the Papilionidae primarily to obtain a level of protection not available to the male of their species . The most distinct case of sexual dimorphism is that of adult females of many <unk> species which have only vestigial wings , legs , and mouthparts as compared to the adult males that are strong fliers with well @-@ developed wings and feathery antennae . 
 = = Reproduction and development = = 
 Species of Lepidoptera undergo <unk> or " complete metamorphosis " . Their lifecycle normally consists of an egg , a larva , a pupa , and an imago or adult . The larvae are commonly called caterpillars , and the pupae of moths encapsulated in silk are called cocoons , while the uncovered pupae of butterflies are called <unk> . 
 = = = Lepidopterans in diapause = = = 
 Unless the species reproduces year @-@ round , a butterfly or moth may enter diapause , a state of dormancy that allows the insect to survive unfavorable environmental conditions . 
 = = = Mating = = = 
 Males usually start eclosion ( emergence ) earlier than females and peak in numbers before females . Both of the sexes are sexually mature by the time of eclosion . Butterflies and moths normally do not associate with each other , except for migrating species , staying relatively asocial . Mating begins with an adult ( female or male ) attracting a mate , normally using visual stimuli , especially in diurnal species like most butterflies . However , the females of most nocturnal species , including almost all moth species , use pheromones to attract males , sometimes from long distances . Some species engage in a form of acoustic courtship , or attract mates using sound or vibration such as the polka @-@ dot wasp moth , <unk> <unk> . 
 Adaptations include undergoing one seasonal generation , two or even more , called <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , respectively ) . Most lepidopterans in temperate climates are univoltine , while in tropical climates most have two seasonal broods . Some others may take advantage of any opportunity they can get , and mate continuously throughout the year . These seasonal adaptations are controlled by hormones , and these delays in reproduction are called diapause . Many lepidopteran species , after mating and laying their eggs , die shortly afterwards , having only lived for a few days after eclosion . Others may still be active for several weeks and then overwinter and become sexually active again when the weather becomes more favorable , or diapause . The sperm of the male that mated most recently with the female is most likely to have fertilized the eggs , but the sperm from a prior mating may still prevail . 
 = = = Lifecycle = = = 
 = = = = Eggs = = = = 
 Lepidoptera usually reproduce sexually and are oviparous ( egg @-@ laying ) , though some species exhibit live birth in a process called ovoviviparity . A variety of differences in egg @-@ laying and the number of eggs laid occur . Some species simply drop their eggs in flight ( these species normally have polyphagous larvae , meaning they eat a variety of plants e. g . , <unk> and some <unk> ) while most lay their eggs near or on the host plant on which the larvae feed . The number of eggs laid may vary from only a few to several thousand . The females of both butterflies and moths select the host plant instinctively , and primarily , by chemical cues . 
 The eggs are derived from materials ingested as a larvae and in some species , from the <unk> received from males during mating . An egg can only be 1 / 1000 the mass of the female , yet she may lay up to her own mass in eggs . Females lay smaller eggs as they age . Larger Females lay larger eggs . The egg is covered by a hard @-@ ridged protective outer layer of shell , called the chorion . It is lined with a thin coating of wax , which prevents the egg from drying out . Each egg contains a number of <unk> , or tiny funnel @-@ shaped openings at one end , the purpose of which is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg . Butterfly and moth eggs vary greatly in size between species , but they are all either spherical or ovate . 
 The egg stage lasts a few weeks in most butterflies , but eggs laid prior to winter , especially in temperate regions , go through diapause , and hatching may be delayed until spring . Other butterflies may lay their eggs in the spring and have them hatch in the summer . These butterflies are usually temperate species ( e. g . <unk> <unk> ) . 
 = = = = Larvae = = = = 
 The larvae or caterpillars are the first stage in the lifecycle after hatching . Caterpillars , are " characteristic <unk> larvae with cylindrical bodies , short thoracic legs , and abdominal prolegs ( pseudopods ) " . They have a toughened ( sclerotised ) head capsule with an <unk> suture formed by medial fusion of the sclerites , mandibles ( mouthparts ) for chewing , and a soft tubular , segmented body , that may have hair @-@ like or other projections , three pairs of true legs , and additional prolegs ( up to five pairs ) . The body consists of thirteen segments , of which three are thoracic and ten are abdominal . Most larvae are herbivores , but a few are carnivores ( some eat ants or other caterpillars ) and detritivores . 
 Different herbivorous species have adapted to feed on every part of the plant and are normally considered pests to their host plants ; some species have been found to lay their eggs on the fruit and other species lay their eggs on clothing or fur ( e. g . , <unk> bisselliella , the common clothes moth ) . Some species are carnivorous and others are even parasitic . Some lycaenid species such as Maculinea rebeli are social parasites of Myrmica ants nests . A species of Geometridae from Hawaii has carnivorous larvae that catch and eat flies . Some pyralid caterpillars are aquatic . 
 The larvae develop rapidly with several generations in a year ; however , some species may take up to 3 years to develop , and exceptional examples like <unk> <unk> take as long as seven years . The larval stage is where the feeding and growing stages occur , and the larvae periodically undergo hormone @-@ induced ecdysis , developing further with each instar , until they undergo the final larval @-@ pupal molt . The lepidopteran pupa , known as a chrysalis in the case of butterflies , has functional mandibles with appendages fused or glued to the body in most species , while the pupal mandibles are not functional in others . 
 The larvae of both butterflies and moths exhibit mimicry to deter potential predators . Some caterpillars have the ability to inflate parts of their heads to appear snake @-@ like . Many have false eye @-@ spots to enhance this effect . Some caterpillars have special structures called <unk> ( family Papilionidae ) , which are exposed to produce smelly chemicals used in defense . Host plants often have toxic substances in them and caterpillars are able to sequester these substances and retain them into the adult stage . This helps make them unpalatable to birds and other predators . Such unpalatability is advertised using bright red , orange , black , or white warning colors . The toxic chemicals in plants are often evolved specifically to prevent them from being eaten by insects . Insects , in turn , develop countermeasures or make use of these toxins for their own survival . This " arms race " has led to the coevolution of insects and their host plants . 
 = = = = Wing development = = = = 
 No form of wing is externally visible on the larva , but when larvae are dissected , developing wings can be seen as disks , which can be found on the second and third thoracic segments , in place of the spiracles that are apparent on abdominal segments . Wing disks develop in association with a trachea that runs along the base of the wing , and are surrounded by a thin <unk> membrane , which is linked to the outer epidermis of the larva by a tiny duct . Wing disks are very small until the last larval instar , when they increase dramatically in size , are invaded by branching tracheae from the wing base that precede the formation of the wing veins , and begin to develop patterns associated with several landmarks of the wing . 
 Near pupation , the wings are forced outside the epidermis under pressure from the hemolymph , and although they are initially quite flexible and fragile , by the time the pupa breaks free of the larval cuticle , they have adhered tightly to the outer cuticle of the pupa ( in obtect pupae ) . Within hours , the wings form a cuticle so hard and well @-@ joined to the body that pupae can be picked up and handled without damage to the wings . 
 = = = = Pupa = = = = 
 After about five to seven instars , or molts , certain hormones , like PTTH , stimulate the production of <unk> , which initiates insect molting . Then , the larva <unk> , a sclerotized or hardened cuticle of the last larval instar , develops into the pupa . Depending on the species , the pupa may be covered in silk and attached to many different types of debris , or may not be covered at all . The pupa stays attached to the leaf by silk spun by the caterpillar before it spins the silk for the full pupa . Features of the imago are externally recognizable in the pupa . All the appendages on the adult head and thorax are found cased inside the cuticle ( antennae , mouthparts , etc . ) , with the wings wrapped around , adjacent to the antennae . 
 While encased , some of the lower segments are not fused , and are able to move using small muscles found in between the membrane . Moving may help the pupa , for example , escape the sun , which would otherwise kill it . The pupa of the Mexican jumping bean moth ( Cydia <unk> ) does this . The larvae cut a trapdoor in the bean ( species of <unk> ) and use the bean as a shelter . With a sudden rise in temperature , the pupa inside twitches and jerks , pulling on the threads inside . <unk> may also help to deter parasitoid wasps from laying eggs on the pupa . Other species of moths are able to make clicks to deter predators . 
 The length of time before the pupa <unk> ( emerges ) varies greatly . The monarch butterfly may stay in its chrysalis for two weeks , while other species may need to stay for more than 10 months in diapause . The adult emerges from the pupa either by using abdominal hooks or from projections located on the head . The mandibles found in the most primitive moth families are used to escape from their cocoon ( e. g . , Micropterigoidea ) . 
 = = = = Adult = = = = 
 Most lepidopteran species do not live long after eclosion , only needing a few days to find a mate and then lay their eggs . Others may remain active for a longer period ( from one to several weeks ) , or go through diapause and overwintering as monarch butterflies do , or waiting out environmental stress . Some adult species of Microlepidoptera go through a stage where no reproductive @-@ related activity occurs , lasting through summer and winter , followed by mating and oviposition in the early spring . 
 While most butterflies and moths are terrestrial , many species of Pyralidae are truly aquatic with all stages except the adult occurring in water . Many species from other families such as Arctiidae , Nepticulidae , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Noctuidae , <unk> , and Sphingidae are aquatic or semiaquatic . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 Flight is an important aspect of the lives of butterflies and moths , and is used for evading predators , searching for food , and finding mates in a timely manner , as lepidopteran species do not live long after eclosion . It is the main form of locomotion in most species . In Lepidoptera , the fore wings and hind wings are mechanically coupled and flap in synchrony . Flight is <unk> , or being driven primarily by action of the fore wings . Although lepidopteran species reportedly can still fly when their hind wings are cut off , it reduces their linear flight and turning capabilities . 
 Lepidopteran species have to be warm , about 77 to 79 ° F ( 25 to 26 ° C ) , to fly . They depend on their body temperature being sufficiently high and since they cannot regulate it themselves , this is dependent on their environment . Butterflies living in cooler climates may use their wings to warm their bodies . They will bask in the sun , spreading out their wings so that they get maximum exposure to the sunlight . In hotter climates butterflies can easily overheat , so they are usually active only during the cooler parts of the day , early morning , late afternoon or early evening . During the heat of the day , they rest in the shade . Some larger thick @-@ bodied moths ( e.g. Sphingidae ) can generate their own heat to a limited degree by vibrating their wings . The heat generated by the flight muscles warms the thorax while the temperature of the abdomen is unimportant for flight . To avoid overheating , some moths rely on hairy scales , internal air sacs , and other structures to separate the thorax and abdomen and keep the abdomen cooler . 
 Some species of butterflies can reach fast speeds , such as the southern dart , which can go as fast as 48 @.@ 4 km / h . <unk> are some of the fastest flying insects , some are capable of flying at over 50 km / h ( 30 mi / h ) , having a wingspan of 35 – 150 mm . In some species , sometimes a gliding component to their flight exists . Flight occurs either as hovering , or as forward or backward motion . In butterfly and moth species , such as hawk moths , hovering is important as they need to maintain a certain stability over flowers when feeding on the nectar . 
 = = = = Navigation = = = = 
 Navigation is important to lepidoptera species , especially for those that migrate . Butterflies , which have more species that migrate , have been shown to navigate using time @-@ compensated sun compasses . They can see polarized light , so can orient even in cloudy conditions . The polarized light in the region close to the ultraviolet spectrum is suggested to be particularly important . Most migratory butterflies are those that live in semiarid areas where breeding seasons are short . The life histories of their host plants also influence the strategies of the butterflies . Other theories include the use of landscapes . Lepidoptera may use coastal lines , mountains , and even roads to orient themselves . Above sea , the flight direction is much more accurate if the coast is still visible . 
 Many studies have also shown that moths navigate . One study showed that many moths may use the Earth 's magnetic field to navigate , as a study of the moth heart and dart suggests . Another study , of the migratory behavior of the silver Y , showed , even at high altitudes , the species can correct its course with changing winds , and prefers flying with favourable winds , suggesting a great sense of direction . <unk> <unk> in Panama loses its navigational capacity when exposed to a magnetic field , suggesting it uses the Earth 's magnetic field . 
 Moths exhibit a tendency to circle artificial lights repeatedly . This suggests they use a technique of celestial navigation called transverse orientation . By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light , such as the Moon , they can fly in a straight line . Celestial objects are so far away , even after traveling great distances , the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible ; further , the moon will always be in the upper part of the visual field or on the horizon . When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation , the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance , in addition to being often below the horizon . The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light , causing airborne moths to come plummeting downwards , and at close range , which results in a spiral flight path that gets closer and closer to the light source . Other explanations have been suggested , such as the idea that moths may be impaired with a visual distortion called a Mach band by Henry Hsiao in 1972 . He stated that they fly towards the darkest part of the sky in pursuit of safety , thus are inclined to circle ambient objects in the Mach band region . 
 = = = = Migration = = = = 
 Lepidopteran migration is typically seasonal , as the insects moving to escape dry seasons or other disadvantageous conditions . Most lepidopterans that migrate are butterflies , and the distance travelled varies . Some butterflies that migrate include the mourning cloak , painted lady , American lady , red admiral , and the common buckeye . The most well @-@ known migrations are those of the eastern population of the monarch butterfly from Mexico to northern United States and southern Canada , a distance of about 4 @,@ 000 – 4 @,@ 800 km ( 2 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 mi ) . Other well @-@ known migratory species include the painted lady and several of the danaine butterflies . Spectacular and large @-@ scale migrations associated with the monsoons are seen in peninsular India . Migrations have been studied in more recent times using wing tags and stable hydrogen isotopes . 
 Moths also undertake migrations , an example being the <unk> . Urania fulgens undergoes population explosions and massive migrations that may be not surpassed by any other insect in the Neotropics . In Costa Rica and Panama , the first population movements may begin in July and early August and depending on the year , may be very massive , continuing unabated for as long as five months . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Pheromones are commonly involved in mating rituals among species , especially moths , but they are also an important aspect of other forms of communication . Usually , the pheromones are produced by either the male or the female and detected by members of the opposite sex with their antennae . In many species , a gland between the eighth and ninth segments under the abdomen in the female produces the pheromones . Communication can also occur through stridulation , or producing sounds by rubbing various parts of the body together . 
 Moths are known to engage in acoustic forms of communication , most often as courtship , attracting mates using sound or vibration . Like most other insects , moths pick up these sounds using tympanic membranes in their abdomens . An example is that of the polka @-@ dot wasp moth ( <unk> <unk> ) , which produces sounds with a frequency above that normally detectable by humans ( about 20 kHz ) . These sounds also function as tactile communication , or communication through touch , as they stridulate , or vibrate a substrate like leaves and stems . 
 Most moths lack bright colors , as many species use coloration as camouflage , but butterflies engage in visual communication . Female cabbage butterflies , for example , use ultraviolet light to communicate , with scales colored in this range on the dorsal wing surface . When they fly , each down stroke of the wing creates a brief flash of ultraviolet light which the males apparently recognize as the flight signature of a potential mate . These flashes from the wings may attract several males that engage in aerial courtship displays . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Moths and butterflies are important in the natural ecosystem . They are integral participants in the food chain ; having co @-@ evolved with flowering plants and predators , lepidopteran species have formed a network of trophic relationships between autotrophs and heterotrophs , which are included in the stages of Lepidoptera larvae , pupae , and adults . Larvae and pupae are links in the diets of birds and parasitic <unk> insects . The adults are included in food webs in a much broader range of consumers ( including birds , small mammals , reptiles , etc . ) . 
 = = = Defense and predation = = = 
 Lepidopteran species are soft bodied , fragile , and almost defenseless , while the immature stages move slowly or are immobile , hence all stages are exposed to predation . Adult butterflies and moths are preyed upon by birds , lizards , amphibians , dragonflies , and spiders . Caterpillars and pupae fall prey not only to birds , but also to invertebrate predators and small mammals , as well as fungi and bacteria . Parasitoid and parasitic wasps and flies may lay eggs in the caterpillar , which eventually kill it as they hatch inside its body and eat its tissues . Insect @-@ eating birds are probably the largest predators . Lepidoptera , especially the immature stages , are an ecologically important food to many insectivorous birds , such as the great tit in Europe . 
 An " evolutionary arms race " can be seen between predator and prey species . The Lepidoptera have developed a number of strategies for defense and protection , including evolution of morphological characters and changes in ecological lifestyles and behaviors . These include aposematism , mimicry , camouflage , and development of threat patterns and displays . Only a few birds , such as the nightjars , hunt nocturnal lepidopterans . Their main predators are bats . Again , an " evolutionary race " exists , which has led to numerous evolutionary adaptations of moths to escape from their main predators , such as the ability to hear ultrasonic sounds , or even to emit sounds in some cases . Lepidopteran eggs are also preyed upon . Some caterpillars , such as the zebra swallowtail butterfly larvae , are cannibalistic . 
 Some species of Lepidoptera are poisonous to predators , such as the monarch butterfly in the Americas , <unk> species ( roses , windmills , etc . ) in Asia , as well as Papilio <unk> , and the <unk> , the largest butterflies in Africa and Asia , respectively . They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues . Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins . Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently , learning not to eat those species . A predator which has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future , thus saving many other species , as well . Toxic butterflies and larvae tend to develop bright colors and striking patterns as an indicator to predators about their toxicity . This phenomenon is known as aposematism . Some caterpillars , especially members of Papilionidae , contain an <unk> , a Y @-@ shaped protrusible gland found in the <unk> segment of the larvae . When threatened , the caterpillar emits unpleasant smells from the organ to ward off the predators . 
 Camouflage is also an important defense strategy , which involves the use of coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment . Some lepidopteran species blend with their surroundings , making them difficult to spot by predators . Caterpillars can exhibit shades of green that match its host plant . Others look like inedible objects , such as twigs or leaves . For instance , the mourning cloak fades into the backdrop of trees when it folds its wings back . The larvae of some species , such as the common Mormon ( Papilio <unk> ) and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings . For example , adult Sesiidae species ( also known as clearwing moths ) have a general appearance sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry . <unk> are a type of automimicry used by some butterflies and moths . In butterflies , the spots are composed of concentric rings of scales in different colors . The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect attention of predators . Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator 's instinct to attack these wing patterns . 
 Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera . Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species ( the mimic ) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species ( the model ) . Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known in the example between the <unk> viceroy butterfly in relation to the inedible danaine monarch . The viceroy is , in fact , more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry . In Müllerian mimicry , inedible species , usually within a taxonomic order , find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators that need to learn about the insects ' inedibility . Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well @-@ known Müllerian complexes . The adults of the various species now resemble each other so well , the species cannot be distinguished without close morphological observation and , in some cases , dissection or genetic analysis . 
 Moths evidently are able to hear the range emitted by bat ] s , which in effect causes flying moths to make evasive maneuvers because bats are a main predator of moths . Ultrasonic frequencies trigger a reflex action in the noctuid moth that cause it to drop a few inches in its flight to evade attack . Tiger moths in a defense emit clicks within the same range of the bats , which interfere with the bats and foil their attempts to echolocate it . 
 = = = Pollination = = = 
 Most species of Lepidoptera engage in some form of <unk> ( more specifically <unk> and <unk> for butterflies and moths , respectively ) , or the pollination of flowers . Most adult butterflies and moths feed on the nectar inside flowers , using their <unk> to reach the nectar hidden at the base of the petals . In the process , the adults brush against the flowers ' stamens , on which the reproductive pollen is made and stored . The pollen is transferred on appendages on the adults , which fly to the next flower to feed and unwittingly deposit the pollen on the stigma of the next flower , where the pollen germinates and fertilizes the seeds . 
 Flowers pollinated by butterflies tend to be large and flamboyant , pink or lavender in color , frequently having a landing area , and usually scented , as butterflies are typically day @-@ flying . Since butterflies do not digest pollen ( except for <unk> species , ) more nectar is offered than pollen . The flowers have simple nectar guides , with the nectaries usually hidden in narrow tubes or spurs , reached by the long " tongue " of the butterflies . Butterflies such as Thymelicus flavus have been observed to engage in flower constancy , which means they are more likely to transfer pollen to other conspecific plants . This can be beneficial for the plants being pollinated , as flower constancy prevents the loss of pollen during different flights and the pollinators from clogging stigmas with pollen of other flower species . 
 Among the more important moth pollinator groups are the hawk moths of the family Sphingidae . Their behavior is similar to hummingbirds , i.e. , using rapid wing beats to hover in front of flowers . Most hawk moths are nocturnal or crepuscular , so moth @-@ pollinated flowers ( e.g. , Silene latifolia ) tend to be white , night @-@ opening , large , and showy with tubular <unk> and a strong , sweet scent produced in the evening , night , or early morning . A lot of nectar is produced to fuel the high metabolic rates needed to power their flight . Other moths ( e.g. , noctuids , <unk> , <unk> ) fly slowly and settle on the flower . They do not require as much nectar as the fast @-@ flying hawk moths , and the flowers tend to be small ( though they may be aggregated in heads ) . 
 = = = Mutualism = = = 
 Mutualism is a form of biological interaction wherein each individual involved benefits in some way . An example of a mutualistic relationship would be that shared by yucca moths ( <unk> ) and their host , yucca flowers ( Liliaceae ) . Female yucca moths enter the host flowers , collect the pollen into a ball using specialized maxillary palps , then move to the apex of the pistil , where pollen is deposited on the stigma , and lay eggs into the base of the pistil where seeds will develop . The larvae develop in the fruit pod and feed on a portion of the seeds . Thus , both insect and plant benefit , forming a highly mutualistic relationship . Another form of mutualism occurs between some larvae of butterflies and certain species of ants ( e. g . Lycaenidae ) . The larvae communicate with the ants using vibrations transmitted through a substrate , such as the wood of a tree or stems , as well as using chemical signals . The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions . 
 = = = Parasitism = = = 
 Only 41 species of parasitoid lepidopterans are known ( 1 @-@ Pyralidae ; 40 @-@ <unk> ) . The larvae of the greater and lesser wax moths feed on the honeycomb inside bee nests and may become pests ; they are also found in bumblebee and wasp nests , albeit to a lesser extent . In northern Europe , the wax moth is regarded as the most serious parasitoid of the bumblebee , and is found only in bumblebee nests . In some areas in southern England , as much as 80 % of nests can be destroyed . Other parasitic larvae are known to prey upon cicadas and leaf hoppers . 
 In reverse , moths and butterflies may be subject to parasitic wasps and flies , which may lay eggs on the caterpillars , which hatch and feed inside its body , resulting in death . Although , in a form of parasitism called <unk> , the adult paralyzes the host , so as not to kill it but for it to live as long as possible , for the parasitic larvae to benefit the most . In another form of parasitism , <unk> , the species live off their hosts while inside ( <unk> ) . These parasites live inside the host caterpillar throughout its lifecycle , or may affect it later on as an adult . In other orders , <unk> include flies , a majority of <unk> , and many hymenopteran parasitoids . Some species may be subject to a variety of parasites , such as the gypsy moth ( <unk> dispar ) , which is attacked by a series of 13 species , in six different taxa throughout its lifecycle . 
 In response to a <unk> egg or larva in the caterpillar 's body , the <unk> , or simply the host 's cells can form a multilayered capsule that eventually causes the <unk> to asphyxiate . The process , called encapsulation , is one of the caterpillar 's only means of defense against parasitoids . 
 = = = Other biological interactions = = = 
 A few species of Lepidoptera are secondary consumers , or predators . These species typically prey upon the eggs of other insects , aphids , scale insects , or ant larvae . Some caterpillars are cannibals , and others prey on caterpillars of other species ( e. g . Hawaiian <unk> ) . Those of the 15 species in <unk> that mirror inchworms , are the only known species of butterflies and moths that are ambush predators . Four species are known to eat snails . For example , the Hawaiian caterpillar , ( H. <unk> ) , uses silk traps , in a manner similar to that of spiders , to capture certain species of snails ( typically <unk> ) . 
 Larvae of some species of moths in the <unk> , <unk> , and Noctuidae ( family / superfamily / families , respectively ) , besides others , feed on detritus , or dead organic material , such as fallen leaves and fruit , fungi , and animal products , and turn it into humus . Well @-@ known species include the cloth moths ( <unk> bisselliella , T. <unk> , and T. <unk> ) , which feed on detritus containing keratin , including hair , feathers , cobwebs , bird nests ( particularly of domestic pigeons , Columba livia domestica ) and fruits or vegetables . These species are important to ecosystems as they remove substances that would otherwise take a long time to decompose . 
 In 2015 it was reported that wasp <unk> DNA was present in Lepidoptera such as Monarch butterflies , silkworms and moths . These were described in some newspaper articles as examples of a naturally occurring genetically engineered insects . 
 = = Evolution and systematics = = 
 = = = History of study = = = 
 Linnaeus in Systema Naturae ( 1758 ) recognized three divisions of the Lepidoptera : Papilio , Sphinx and <unk> , with seven subgroups in <unk> . These persist today as 9 of the superfamilies of Lepidoptera . Other works on classification followed including those by Michael Denis & Ignaz <unk> ( 1775 ) , Johan Christian Fabricius ( 1775 ) and Pierre André Latreille ( 1796 ) . Jacob Hübner described many genera , and the Lepidopteran genera were catalogued by Ferdinand <unk> and Georg Friedrich Treitschke in a series of volumes on the Lepidopteran fauna of Europe published between 1807 and 1835 . Gottlieb August Wilhelm <unk> @-@ Schäffer ( several volumes , 1843 – 1856 ) , and Edward Meyrick ( 1895 ) based their classifications primarily on wing venation . Sir George Francis Hampson worked on the ' Microlepidoptera ' during this period and Philipp Christoph Zeller published The Natural History of the <unk> also on Microlepidoptera ( 1855 ) . 
 Among the first entomologists to study fossil insects and their evolution was Samuel Hubbard Scudder ( 1837 – 1911 ) , who worked on butterflies . He published a study of the Florissant deposits of Colorado , including the exceptionally preserved Prodryas persephone . Andreas V. Martynov ( 1879 – 1938 ) recognized the close relationship between Lepidoptera and Trichoptera in his studies on phylogeny . 
 Major contributions in the 20th century included the creation of the <unk> and <unk> ( based on female genital structure ) by Borner in 1925 and 1939 . Willi Hennig ( 1913 – 1976 ) developed the cladistic methodology and applied it to insect phylogeny . Niels P. Kristensen , E. S. Nielsen and D. R. Davis studied the relationships among monotrysian families and Kristensen worked more generally on insect phylogeny and higher Lepidoptera too . While it is often found that DNA @-@ based phylogenies differ from those based on morphology , this has not been the case for the Lepidoptera ; DNA phylogenies correspond to a large extent to morphology @-@ based phylogenies . 
 Many attempts have been made to group the superfamilies of the Lepidoptera into natural groups , most of which fail because one of the two groups is not monophyletic : <unk> and Macrolepidoptera , <unk> and Rhopalocera , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and Ditrysia . 
 = = = Fossil record = = = 
 The fossil record for Lepidoptera is lacking in comparison to other winged species , and tending not to be as common as some other insects in the habitats that are most conducive to fossilization , such as lakes and ponds , and their juvenile stage has only the head capsule as a hard part that might be preserved . The location and abundance of the most common moth species are indicative that mass migrations of moths occurred over the Palaeogene North Sea , which is why there is a serious lack of moth fossils . Yet there are fossils , some preserved in amber and some in very fine sediments . Leaf mines are also seen in fossil leaves , although the interpretation of them is tricky . 
 Putative fossil stem group representatives of <unk> ( the clade comprising Trichoptera and Lepidoptera ) are known from the Triassic . The earliest known fossil lepidopteran is <unk> mane from the Jurassic , about 190 million years ago in Dorset , UK . The fossil belongs to a small primitive moth @-@ like species , and its wings are showing scales with parallel grooves under a scanning electron microscope and a characteristic wing venation pattern shared with Trichoptera ( Caddisflies ) . Only two more sets of Jurassic lepidopteran fossils have been found , as well as 13 sets from the Cretaceous , which all belong to primitive moth @-@ like families . Many more fossils are found from the Tertiary , and particularly the Eocene Baltic amber . The oldest genuine butterflies of the superfamily Papilionoidea have been found in the Paleocene <unk> or Fur Formation of Denmark . The best preserved fossil lepidopteran is the Eocene Prodryas persephone from the Florissant Fossil Beds . 
 = = = Phylogeny = = = 
 Lepidoptera and Trichoptera ( caddisflies ) are more closely related to each other than to any other insect order , sharing many similarities that are lacking in others ; for example the females of both orders are heterogametic , meaning they have two different sex chromosomes , whereas in most species the males are heterogametic and the females have two identical sex chromosomes . The adults in both orders display a particular wing venation pattern on their forewings . The larvae of both orders have mouth structures and gland with which they make and manipulate silk . Willi Hennig grouped the two sister orders into the <unk> superorder . This group probably evolved in the Jurassic , having split from the now extinct order <unk> . Lepidoptera descend from a diurnal moth @-@ like common ancestor that either fed on dead or living plants . 
 Micropterigidae , Agathiphagidae and Heterobathmiidae are the oldest and most basal lineages of Lepidoptera . The adults of these families do not have the curled tongue or proboscis , that are found in most members order , but instead have chewing mandibles adapted for a special diet . Micropterigidae larvae feed on leaves , fungi , or liverworts ( much like the Trichoptera ) . Adult Micropterigidae chew the pollen or spores of ferns . In the Agathiphagidae , larvae live inside kauri pines and feed on seeds . In Heterobathmiidae the larvae feed on the leaves of Nothofagus , the southern beech tree . These families also have mandibles in the pupal stage , which help the pupa emerge from the seed or cocoon after metamorphosis . 
 The <unk> have a short coiled proboscis in the adult stage , and though they retain their pupal mandibles with which they escaped the cocoon , their mandibles are non @-@ functional thereafter . Most of these non @-@ ditrysian families , are primarily leaf miners in the larval stage . In addition to the proboscis , there is a change in the scales among these basal lineages , with later lineages showing more complex perforated scales . 
 With the evolution of the Ditrysia in the mid @-@ Cretaceous , there was a major reproductive change . The Ditrysia , which comprise 98 % of the Lepidoptera , have two separate openings for reproduction in the females ( as well as a third opening for excretion ) , one for mating , and one for laying eggs . The two are linked internally by a seminal duct . ( In more basal lineages there is one cloaca , or later , two openings and an external sperm canal . ) Of the early lineages of Ditrysia , <unk> and <unk> are mostly leaf miners , but more recent lineages feed externally . In the <unk> , most species feed on plant and animal detritus and fungi , and build shelters in the larval stage . 
 The <unk> is the first group to have significant numbers of species whose larvae feed on herbaceous plants , as opposed to woody plants . They evolved about the time that flowering plants underwent an expansive adaptive radiation in the mid @-@ Cretaceous , and the <unk> that evolved at this time also have great diversity . Whether the processes involved coevolution or sequential evolution , the diversity of the Lepidoptera and the angiosperms increased together . 
 In the so @-@ called " Macrolepidoptera " , which constitutes about 60 % of lepidopteran species , there was a general increase in size , better flying ability ( via changes in wing shape and linkage of the forewings and hindwings ) , reduction in the adult mandibles , and a change in the arrangement of the crochets ( hooks ) on the larval prolegs , perhaps to improve the grip on the host plant . Many also have tympanal organs , that allow them to hear . These organs evolved eight times , at least , because they occur on different body parts and have structural differences . The main lineages in the Macrolepidoptera are the Noctuoidea , Bombycoidea , Lasiocampidae , <unk> , <unk> and Rhopalocera . Bombycoidea plus Lasiocampidae plus <unk> may be a monophyletic group . The Rhopalocera , comprising the Papilionoidea ( butterflies ) , Hesperioidea ( skippers ) , and the Hedyloidea ( moth @-@ butterflies ) , are the most recently evolved . There is quite a good fossil record for this group , with the oldest skipper dating from 56 million years ago . 
 = = = Taxonomy = = = 
 Taxonomy is the classification of species in selected taxa , the process of naming being called nomenclature . There are over 120 families in lepidoptera , in 45 to 48 superfamilies . Lepidoptera have always been , historically , classified in five suborders , one of which is of primitive moths that never lost the morphological features of its ancestors . The rest of the moths and butterflies make up ninety @-@ eight percent of the other taxa , making Ditrysia . More recently , findings of new taxa , larvae and pupa have aided in detailing the relationships of primitive taxa , phylogenetic analysis showing the primitive lineages to be paraphyletic compared to the rest of Lepidoptera lineages . Recently lepidopterists have abandoned clades like suborders , and those between orders and superfamilies . 
 <unk> is a clade with Micropterigoidea being its only superfamily , containing the single family Micropterigidae . Species of Micropterigoidea are practically living fossils , being one of the most primitive lepidopteran groups , still retaining chewing mouthparts ( mandibles ) in adults , unlike other clades of butterflies and moths . About 120 species are known worldwide , with more than half the species in the genus <unk> in the <unk> region . There are only 2 known in North America ( <unk> ) , with many more being found Asia and the southwest Pacific , particularly New Zealand with about 50 species . 
 Glossata contains a majority of the species , with the most obvious difference is non @-@ functioning mandibles , and elongated maxillary galeae or the proboscis . The basal clades still retaining some of the ancestral features of the wings such as similarly shaped fore- and hindwings with relatively complete venation . Glossata also contains the division Ditrysia , which contains 98 % of all described species in Lepidoptera . 
 <unk> it is the second most primitive lineage of lepidoptera ; being first described in 1952 by Lionel Jack <unk> . Agathiphagidae and Heterobathmiidae are the only families in <unk> . Agathiphagidae only contains about 2 species in its genus Agathiphaga . Agathiphaga <unk> and Agathiphaga vitiensis , being found along the north @-@ eastern coast of Queensland , Australia , and in Fiji to Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands , respectively . 
 <unk> was first described by Kristensen and Nielsen in 1979 . There are about 10 species , which are day @-@ flying , metallic moths , confined to southern South America , the adults eat the pollen of Nothofagus or Southern Beech and the larvae mine the leaves .

 = = = Culture = = = 
 Artistic depictions of butterflies have been used in many cultures including as early as 3500 years ago , in Egyptian hieroglyphs . Today , butterflies are widely used in various objects of art and jewelry : mounted in frames , embedded in resin , displayed in bottles , laminated in paper , and in some mixed media artworks and furnishings . Butterflies have also inspired the " butterfly fairy " as an art and fictional character . 
 In many cultures the soul of a dead person is associated with the butterfly , for example in Ancient Greece , where the word for butterfly <unk> ( psyche ) also means soul and breath . In Latin , as in Ancient Greece , the word for " butterfly " papilio was associated with the soul of the dead . The skull @-@ like marking on the thorax of the Death 's @-@ head <unk> has helped these moths , particularly A. <unk> , earn a negative reputation , such as associations with the supernatural and evil . The moth has been prominently featured in art and movies such as Un Chien Andalou ( by Buñuel and Dalí ) and The Silence of the Lambs , and in the artwork of the Japanese metal band Sigh 's album Hail Horror Hail . According to Kwaidan : Stories and Studies of Strange Things , by Lafcadio Hearn , a butterfly was seen in Japan as the personification of a person 's soul ; whether they be living , dying , or already dead . One Japanese superstition says that if a butterfly enters your <unk> and perches behind the bamboo screen , the person whom you most love is coming to see you . However , large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens . When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt , there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened — thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil . 
 In the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan , the brilliantly colored image of the butterfly was carved into many temples , buildings , jewelry , and emblazoned on incense burners in particular . The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar and some species were considered to be the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors . The close association of butterflies to fire and warfare persisted through to the Aztec civilization and evidence of similar jaguar @-@ butterfly images has been found among the Zapotec , and Maya civilizations . 
 = = = Pests = = = 
 The larvae of many Lepidopteran species are major pests in agriculture . Some of the major pests include <unk> , Noctuidae , and Pyralidae . The larvae of the Noctuidae genus <unk> ( <unk> ) , Helicoverpa ( corn earworm ) , or Pieris brassicae can cause extensive damage to certain crops . Helicoverpa zea larvae ( cotton <unk> or tomato <unk> ) are polyphagous , meaning they eat a variety of crops , including tomatoes and cotton . 
 Butterflies and moths are one of the largest taxa to solely feed and be dependent on living plants , in terms of the number of species , and they are in many ecosystems , making up the largest biomass to do so . In many species , the female may produce anywhere from 200 to 600 eggs , while in some others it may go as high as 30 @,@ 000 eggs in one day . This can create many problems for agriculture , where many caterpillars can affect acres of vegetation . Some reports estimate that there have been over 80 @,@ 000 caterpillars of several different taxa feeding on a single oak tree . In some cases , phytophagous larvae can lead to the destruction of entire trees in relatively short periods of time . 
 Ecological ways of removing pest lepidoptera species are becoming more economically viable , as research has shown ways like introducing parasitic wasp and flies . For example , <unk> <unk> , a fly which deposited larvae feed upon the pupae of the Forest Tent Caterpillar Moth . Pesticides can affect other species other than the species they are targeted to eliminate , damaging the natural ecosystem . Another good biological pest control method is the use of pheromone traps . A pheromone trap is a type of insect trap that uses pheromones to lure insects . Sex pheromones and aggregating pheromones are the most common types used . A pheromone @-@ impregnated lure is encased in a conventional trap such as a Delta trap , water @-@ pan trap , or funnel trap . 
 Species of moths that are detritivores would naturally eat detritus containing keratin , such as hairs or feathers . Well known species are cloth moths ( T. bisselliella , T. <unk> , and T. <unk> ) , feeding on foodstuffs that people find economically important , such as cotton , linen , silk and wool fabrics as well as furs ; furthermore they have been found on shed feathers and hair , bran , semolina and flour ( possibly preferring wheat flour ) , biscuits , casein , and insect specimens in museums . 
 = = = Beneficial insects = = = 
 Even though most butterflies and moths affect the economy negatively , some species are a valuable economic resource . The most prominent example is that of the Domesticated silkworm moth ( Bombyx mori ) , the larvae of which make their cocoons out of silk , which can be spun into cloth . Silk is and has been an important economic resource throughout history . The species Bombyx mori has been domesticated to the point where it is completely dependent on mankind for survival . A number of wild moths such as Bombyx <unk> , and <unk> species , besides others , provide commercially important silks . 
 The preference of the larvae of most Lepidopteran species to feed on a single species or limited range of plants is used as a mechanism for biological control of weeds in place of herbicides . The pyralid cactus moth was introduced from Argentina to Australia , where it successfully suppressed millions of acres of Prickly pear cactus . Another species of the Pyralidae , called the alligator weed stem borer ( <unk> <unk> ) , was used to control the aquatic plant known as alligator weed ( <unk> <unk> ) in conjunction with the alligator weed flea beetle ; in this case , the two insects work in synergy and the weed rarely recovers . 
 Breeding butterflies and moths , or butterfly gardening / rearing , has become an ecologically viable process of introducing species into the ecosystem to benefit it . Butterfly ranching in Papua New Guinea permits nationals of that country to " farm " economically valuable insect species for the collectors market in an ecologically sustainable manner . 
 = = = Food = = = 
 Lepidoptera feature prominently in <unk> as food items on almost every continent . While in most cases , adults , larvae or pupae are eaten as staples by indigenous people , <unk> or silkworm pupae are eaten as a snack in Korean cuisine while <unk> worm is considered a delicacy in Mexico . In the <unk> region of Italy , children catch and eat <unk> of the toxic Zygaena moths in early summer . The <unk> , despite having a very low cyanogenic content , serve as a convenient , supplementary source of sugar to the children who can include this resource as a seasonal delicacy at minimum risk . 
 = = = Health = = = 
 Some larvae of both moths and butterflies have a form of hair that has been known to be a cause of human health problems . Caterpillar hairs sometimes have toxins in them and species from approximately 12 families of moths or butterflies worldwide can inflict serious human injuries ( <unk> dermatitis and atopic asthma to osteochondritis , consumption coagulopathy , renal failure , and intracerebral hemorrhage ) . Skin rashes are the most common , but there have been fatalities . <unk> is a frequent cause of envenomation in humans in Brazil , with 354 cases reported between 1989 and 2005 . <unk> ranging up to 20 % with death caused most often by intracranial hemorrhage . 
 These hairs have also been known to cause <unk> @-@ conjunctivitis . The sharp barbs on the end of caterpillar hairs can get lodged in soft tissues and mucous membranes such as the eyes . Once they enter such tissues , they can be difficult to extract , often exacerbating the problem as they migrate across the membrane . This becomes a particular problem in an indoor setting . The hairs easily enter buildings through ventilation systems and accumulate in indoor environments because of their small size , which makes it difficult for them to be vented out . This accumulation increases the risk of human contact in indoor environments .

 = Pleione ( star ) = 
 Pleione ( 28 Tauri , BU Tauri ) is a binary star in the Pleiades star cluster ( M45 ) , located roughly 390 light years away in the constellation of Taurus . Pleione was not given a Bayer designation , but did receive a Flamsteed number — hence its designation 28 Tauri . Since the star is located close to Atlas , it 's difficult for stargazers to distinguish with the naked eye , even though it 's a hot type B star 190 times more luminous than the Sun . Pleione rotates even faster than Achernar on its axis , close to its breakup velocity . 
 The brighter star of the binary pair , component A , is a classical Be star with certain distinguishing traits : periodic phase changes and a complex circumstellar environment composed of two gaseous disks at different angles to each other . Although some research on the system has been performed , stellar characteristics of the orbiting B component are not well known . Pleione is the seventh brightest star in the Pleiades , after <unk> . 
 = = Visibility = = 
 With an apparent magnitude of + 5 @.@ 05 in V , the star is rather difficult to make out with the naked eye , especially since its close neighbour Atlas is 3 @.@ 7 times brighter and located less than 5 arcminutes away . Beginning in October of each year , Pleione along with the rest of the cluster can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before dawn . To see it after sunset , one will need to wait until December . By mid @-@ February , the star is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe , with only those south of 66 ° unable to see it . Even in cities like Cape Town , South Africa , at the tip of the African continent , the star rises almost 32 ° above the horizon . Due to its declination of roughly + 24 ° , Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66 ° North . Once late April arrives , the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon , soon to disappear with the other setting stars . 
 Pleione is classified as a Gamma Cassiopeiae type variable star , with brightness fluctuations that range between a 4 @.@ 8 and 5 @.@ 5 visual magnitude . Its variable star designation is BU Tauri . The SIMBAD astronomical database lists its spectral class as <unk> , although the current classification recognized by many researchers is <unk> . The suffix " ev " stands for " Spectral emission that exhibits variability " whilst the suffix " pe " refers to " Emission lines with peculiarity " . In the case of Pleione , the " peculiar " emissions come from gaseous circumstellar disks formed of material being ejected from the star . 
 There has been significant debate as to the star 's actual distance from Earth . The debate revolves around the different methodologies to measure distance — parallax being the most central , but photometric and spectroscopic observations yielding valuable insights as well . Before the Hipparcos mission , the estimated distance for the Pleiades star cluster was around 135 parsecs or 440 light years . However , when the Hipparcos Catalogue was published in 1997 , the new parallax measurement indicated a much closer distance of about 119 ± 1 @.@ 0 pc ( 388 ± 3 @.@ 2 ly ) , triggering substantial controversy among astronomers . If the Hipparcos estimate were accurate , some astronomers contend , then stars in the cluster would have to be fainter than Sun @-@ like stars — a notion that would challenge some of the fundamental precepts of stellar structure . Interferometric measurements taken in 2004 by the Hubble Telescope 's Fine Guidance Sensors and corroborated by studies from Caltech and NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory showed the original estimate of 135 pc or 440 ly to be the correct figure . However a recent study published in 2009 has argued otherwise , publishing a new parallax measurement of 8 @.@ 32 mas with a very tight error factor of 0 @.@ 13 mas yielding a distance of 120 @.@ 2 ± 1 @.@ 9 pc or 392 @.@ 0 ± 6 @.@ 0 ly . Which distance estimate future astrometric calculations will corroborate remains to be seen , although the upcoming Gaia mission with its expected launch in late 2012 could well prove to be the ultimate arbiter in this debate . 
 = = Properties = = 
 In 1942 Otto Struve , one of the early researchers of Be Stars , stated that Pleione is " the most interesting member of the Pleiades cluster " . Like many of the stars in the cluster , Pleione is a blue @-@ white B @-@ type main sequence dwarf star with a temperature of about 12 @,@ 000 Kelvin . It has a bolometric luminosity of 190 L ☉ assuming a distance of roughly 120 pc . With a radius of 3 @.@ 2 R ☉ and mass that is 3 @.@ 4 M ☉ , Pleione is considerably smaller than the brightest stars in the Pleiades . Alcyone for instance has a radius that is 10 R ☉ with a luminosity 2 @,@ 400 L ☉ , making it roughly 30 times more voluminous than Pleione and about 13 times brighter . 
 = = = Be star = = = 
 Pleione is a classical Be star , often referred to as an " active hot star " . Classical Be stars are B @-@ type stars close to the main sequence with an " e " added on , signifying that Pleione exhibits emission lines in its spectrum rather than absorption lines , which is what stars usually show . Emission lines usually indicate that a star is surrounded by gas . In the case of a Be star , the gas is typically in the form of an equatorial disk , resulting in electromagnetic radiation that emanates not just from the photosphere , but from the disk as well . The geometry and kinematics of this gaseous circumstellar environment are therefore best explained by a " Keplerian " disk — one that is supported against gravity by rotation rather than gas or radiation pressure . Circumstellar disks like this are sometimes referred to as " <unk> disks " , which is material being actively ejected by the star as opposed to " accretion disks " which involves material falling toward the star . 
 Be Stars are fast <unk> ( > 200 km / s ) with a large stellar wind and high mass loss rate , hence the causative factors behind these gaseous rings . Due to its apparent brightness , the star most recognized for its fast rotation is Achernar , a phenomenon which causes it to be highly oblate . Its rotational velocity , however , of 251 km / s is considerably slower than Pleione 's 329 km / s . As a result , Pleione actually revolves on its axis once every 11 @.@ 8 hours compared to Achernar 's 48 @.@ 4 hours . The Sun by comparison takes 25 @.@ 3 days to turn on its axis . Pleione is spinning so fast that it is close to the estimated breakup velocity for a B8V star of about 370 – 390 km / s . Another Be star whose rotational velocity is extremely fast is Alpha Arae at 470 km / s — a speed so extreme that it is on the verge of exploding . 
 What makes Pleione particularly unique is that it alternates between three different phases : 1 ) normal B star , 2 ) Be star and 3 ) Be shell star . The cause is likely the surrounding gaseous disk which in many Be stars will appear , then disappear , possibly reforming at a later time . Material in the disc is attracted back towards the star by the pull of gravity , but if it has enough energy it can escape into space , contributing to the stellar wind . Sometimes , Be stars will form multiple gas rings or " <unk> disks " , each with its own evolution , creating complex circumstellar dynamics . 
 As a result of such dynamics , Pleione exhibits prominent long @-@ term photometric and spectroscopic variations encompassing a period of about 35 years . In fact , during the last 100 years , Pleione has demonstrated notable phase changes — as a Be phase until 1903 , a B phase ( 1905 – 1936 ) , a B @-@ shell phase ( 1938 – 1954 ) , and another Be phase ( 1955 – 1972 ) . It then entered a Be @-@ shell phase in 1972 . Then , the star developed many shell absorption lines in its spectrum . At the same time , the star showed a decrease in brightness , beginning at the end of 1971 . After reaching the minimum brightness in late 1973 , the star gradually brightened . In 1989 , Pleione entered a Be phase and stayed as a Be star until the summer of 2005 . 
 The most recent disk responsible for these phase changes was formed in 1972 . What 's intriguing , however , is that Pleione 's long @-@ term <unk> observations show the intrinsic polarization angle has changed , providing direct evidence for a spatial motion of the disk axis . Because Pleione has a stellar companion with a relatively close orbit , the shift in the polarization angle has been attributed to the companion causing a precession ( wobble ) of the disk , with a precession period of roughly 81 years . 
 Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations from 2005 to 2007 indicate that a new disk has formed around the equator — thus constituting a double disk phenomenon with disks at different angles . The inclination angle of the new disk is estimated at 60 ° whereas the previous disk was inclined at around 30 ° . Such a misaligned double @-@ disk structure has never been observed before among Be stars . Thus , Pleione provides a rare opportunity to investigate the forming process of a new disk and the consequent interaction between the two . 
 = = Star system = = 
 Pleione is known to be a speckle binary , although its orbital parameters have yet to be fully established . In 1996 a group of Japanese and French astronomers discovered that Pleione is a single @-@ lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 218 @.@ 0 days and a large eccentricity of 0 @.@ 6 . The Washington Double Star Catalogue lists an angular separation between the two components of 0 @.@ 2 arcseconds — an angle which equates to a distance of about 24 AU , assuming a distance of 120 parsecs .

 = = = Mythology = = = 
 Pleione was an Oceanid nymph of Mount <unk> in Arkadia ( southern Greece ) , one of the three thousand daughters of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys . The nymphs in Greek mythology were the spirits of nature ; <unk> , spirits of the sea . Though considered lesser divinities , they were still very much venerated as the protectors of the natural world . Each <unk> was thence a patroness of a particular body of water — be it ocean , river , lake , spring or even cloud — and by extension activities related thereto . The sea @-@ nymph , Pleione , was the consort of Atlas , the Titan , and mother of the <unk> , Hyades and Pleiades . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 When names were assigned to the stars in the Pleiades cluster , the bright pair of stars in the East of the cluster were named Atlas and Pleione , while the seven other bright stars were named after the mythological Pleiades ( the ' Seven Sisters ' ) . The term " Pleiades " was used by Valerius Flaccus to apply to the cluster as a whole , and Riccioli called the star Mater Pleione . 
 There is some diversity of opinion as to the origin of the names Pleione and Pleiades . There are three possible derivations of note . Foremost is that both names come from the Greek word <unk> , ( pr. <unk> ' <unk> ) , meaning " to sail " . This is particularly plausible given that ancient Greece was a seafaring culture and because of Pleione 's mythical status as an Oceanid nymph . Pleione , as a result , is sometimes referred to as the " sailing queen " while her daughters the " sailing ones " . Also , the appearance of these stars coincided with the sailing season in antiquity ; sailors were well advised to set sail only when the Pleiades were visible at night , lest they meet with misfortune . 
 Another derivation of the name is the Greek word <unk> ( pr. <unk> ) , meaning " more " , " plenty " , or " full " — a <unk> with many English derivatives like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , plethora and Pliocene . This meaning also coincides with the biblical <unk> and the Arabic word for the Pleiades — Al Thurayya . In fact , Pleione may have been numbered amongst the <unk> ( nymphs of meadows and pastures ) and presided over the multiplication of the animals , as her name means " to increase in number " . 
 Finally , the last comes from <unk> ( Greek : <unk> , " doves " ) , a reference to the sisters ' mythical transformation by Zeus into a flock of doves following their pursuit by Orion , the giant huntsman , across the heavens .

 In the best @-@ selling 1955 nature book published by Time @-@ Life called The World We Live In , there is an artist 's impression of Pleione entitled Purple Pleione . The illustration is from the famed space artist Chesley Bonestell and carries the caption : " Purple Pleione , a star of the familiar Pleiades cluster , rotates so rapidly that it has flattened into a flying saucer and hurled forth a dark red ring of hydrogen . Where the excited gas crosses Pleione 's equator , it obscures her violet light . " 
 Given its mythical connection with sailing and orchids , the name Pleione is often associated with grace , speed and elegance . Some of the finest designs in racing yachts have the name Pleione , and the recent Shanghai Oriental Art Center draws its inspiration from an orchid . Fat Jon in his new album Hundred Eight Stars has a prismatic track dedicated to 28 Tauri .

 So Amazin ' is the third studio album by American singer Christina Milian . The album , her first studio release since 2004 's It 's About Time , was released by Island Records on May 16 , 2006 in the United States . Unlike previous records , which had contributions from many producers , Milian wrote and produced So Amazin ' primarily with hip hop producers Cool & Dre . During production , Milian was mentored by L.A. Reid and executive producer Jay @-@ Z of Def Jam Recordings . 
 The album 's musical style is primarily urban and R & B , in contrast to the pop sounds of Milian 's previous albums , a change suggested by Island Def Jam . Following criticism over her previous albums for a lack of consistency , Milian had ten of the album 's tracks produced by Cool & Dre . Lyrically , the album was inspired by Milian 's breakup with Nick Cannon . So Amazin ' was completed within a three @-@ month period , and Milian received writing credit for nine of the album 's songs . 
 The album debuted and peaked at number 11 on the U.S. Billboard 200 , and sold a total of 163 @,@ 000 copies . Internationally , the album charted in the United Kingdom , France and Switzerland . The album 's only single , " Say I " , featuring rapper Jeezy , saw peak positions of number four in the UK , and number 21 in the United States . The critical response to So Amazin ' was mixed . The album 's production and " Say I " were generally praised , while several critics did not feel that the album showcased Milian 's personality . One week after the release of So Amazin ' , Milian was dropped from Island Records . 
 = = Background = = 
 Milian 's previous release , It 's About Time ( 2004 ) , was her second studio album , but served as her debut in the US . The critical response to the album was mixed to generally negative . The club tracks , most notably lead single " Dip It Low " , were praised ; however , the ballads were said to be disappointing . The album only performed modestly commercially ; it debuted and peaked at number 14 on the Billboard 200 album chart , selling a total of 382 @,@ 000 copies , but managed to achieve Silver certification in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry . The album received a Grammy Award nomination for " Best Contemporary R & B Album " in 2005 . 
 Following the album 's release , Milian was cast in a lead role in the horror film Pulse , starring alongside Kristen Bell and Ian Somerhalder . Milian traveled to Romania for filming , and later discovered that her then @-@ boyfriend Nick Cannon had cheated on her while she was away . Milian said in an interview , " it was heartbreaking for me . I was a good girl , a really loyal girl – and I got beat real . " 
 Whereas Milian 's previous albums had pop and R & B stylings , she was encouraged by Island Def Jam to target a new audience and release an urban record . Explaining the change , Milian said that one of her main problems was that previous releases would often find mainstream success , but would be relatively unsuccessful on urban radio . As an R & B artist , she wanted to build her core audience – a true fan base that would support her through time – to increase her career 's longevity . The main purpose of her genre change was to go back to the streets and add to her core audience . 
 = = Production = = 
 To create a more urban record , Milian had a list of producers that she wanted to work with for So Amazin ' . She said that in most cases , even when she had R & B producers , most songs would end up being pop instead of R & B. L.A. Reid suggested to Milian that she should work with Cool & Dre , with whom she ended up working with as the first people to start off the album . Although Milian was originally supposed to work with several different music producers , she felt that the chemistry they had in the first week was so " instant and real " that she felt she could not get a better " vibe " with anybody else other than them . Together , they produced four songs in the first few days , which prompted Milian to ask her label if she could continue working with the duo . At the same time , Cool & Dre called their managers to ask if they could continue working with Milian . Milian felt that it was " just the perfect connection " , and that working with them " just felt so original " . The singer described Cool & Dre as " beat makers " , rather than just hip @-@ hop producers , and believed that she was really able to express herself lyrically through their music . 
 Milian ended up working with Cool & Dre on the majority of the production of the album , producing ten of the album 's eleven tracks together . Milian also wrote the track " Y 'all Ain 't Nothin ' " with Ne @-@ Yo , which was produced by The Heavyweights . Features on the album include Three 6 Mafia , Young Jeezy , and Dre of Cool & Dre . While working on the song , " Who 's Gonna Ride " , Dre ran into Three 6 Mafia at the studio and they agreed to feature on the song . The album completed within a three @-@ month period , whereas Milian 's previous albums would take six months to a year . 
 Milian received writing credit for nine songs on the album . Milian did not try to write mainstream records for the radio ; rather , she wrote about " everything , about your life and concentrate on you doing you . " For previous albums , Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past , whereas for So Amazin ' , she focused on the present . She compared the writing process to writing a diary ; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important , she would write it down for future reference . Milian felt that by writing down true experiences , her songs were like " captured emotion " . When writing songs , Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied . It would depend on what she was writing about , what was going on in her life , and if it pertained to that exact moment . Sometimes the process was quick , but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song . 
 Although Milian was a songwriter since her teenagers years , she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her , " there are no rules " . Previously , Milian would write songs that followed rules , where she would have a hook , a verse , and another verse with similar sound and melody . For So Amazin , she wrote with a " no rules theory " , which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album . She said , " It was just , you know what ? I can change up the melody I can do different things . Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it 'll come to you and end up being hot . So that 's probably my biggest obstacle , just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new . Once I got past all that , it was just easy . With flying colors , I started writing all the records . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 Milian described So Amazin ' as a " consistent , very real and personal album " . A problem Milian had with her previous album , It 's About Time , was that it did not flow . The various pop and urban influences in that album confused the audience , and Milian wanted So Amazin ' to paint a picture ; " you get led down the whole way , you kinda get to see my growth through one album " . Wanting a more consistent approach for her new album , Milian collaborated with only one team of producers , which made for a greater representation of a " more mature , settled " Milian . The purpose of the album was to record an album that had more realness , so that female fans could relate to what she was singing about . Milian felt that Cool & Dre brought their own style of beats to the album , giving it a " raw feel " and " street credibility " . Marcello " Cool " Valenzano of Cool & Dre said that " we come from an R & B background , and we bringing [ sic ] something new to the table , a style we think is hot . " For So Amazin ' , Milian knew that she needed to record material that had a " realness " . She wanted to make dance tracks , but also wanted to express more of herself at the same time . Milian found the album to be " so much more real and urban and street " than her previous albums . 
 The single , " Say I " , is an inspirational and motivational record ; Milian wanted to make a record that would be an inspiration to both her and her fans . Focusing on an urban audience , Milian said the record was " way more an urban record than anything I 've ever done . " The singer felt it was necessary to have Young Jeezy feature because he spoke for the streets , and thought his rap was " a very real message . It pertained to his life . " The track , " Twisted " , was one of the first songs recorded for the album . Lyrically , the song is about liking someone so much that you " can 't even go about [ your ] day in a normal way " . Milian compared the urban vibe of both tracks and said they were huge records , " where the music is just big and the hook is just big and you can ’ t help but sing [ along ] . " 
 Dre features on two tracks , " So Amazing " and " Hot Boy " , which both have a club vibe . Milian thought " So Amazing " had a similar vibe to several performance records she had done in the past . Milian raps in the track and described it as being " really street and sexy " . She also said " Hot Boy " is a " hot one for the streets and for the club and for performance . " " Foolin ' " was written when Milian heard an old record and sampled the line , " if you 're <unk> , only <unk> " . Hearing the original track , Milian knew she needed to write something original , and wrote about an ex @-@ boyfriend , whom she nicknamed " Mr. Big " , that was still interested in Milian but had a new girlfriend . The album 's final track , " She Don 't Know " , has a Latin vibe and features a Spanish guitar . Being Cuban , Milian wanted to incorporate a Spanish record on the album , and sings in English and Spanish in the song . Taking inspiration from Latin soap operas , Milian wanted to portray a very " dramatic feel " in the song . Lyrically , the song is about two people falling in love ; however , the man has a girlfriend who does not know about the new relationship or that he has moved on . 
 Milian wrote So Amazin ' based on her own life , and each record pertained to a different aspect , especially focused on relationships . During early production of the album , Milian was dealing with her break @-@ up with actor Nick Cannon and wrote several records based on that . While writing the mid @-@ tempo track " My Lovin ' Goes " , Milian felt she turned a new leaf . She said , " you see the change in So Amazin ' where life was just really coming into place . I was finally becoming the woman that I feel that I am right now . Also , I was leaving old love behind and learning about new types of love . Which is great , whether it be life , and also the dating scene is really nice . " Two tracks which Milian wrote about Cannon were " Gonna Tell Everybody " and " Who 's Gonna Ride " . When Milian and Cool & Dre had discussions , her break @-@ up with Cannon was regularly mentioned . Milian felt a need to express herself , and writing became therapeutic for Milian ; she was able to get through the break @-@ up by writing songs . The production by Cool & Dre also inspired Milian to write the tracks , as she felt comfortable with them and was able to be open . 
 Milian wrote the hip @-@ hop ballad " Gonna Tell Everybody " about " thinking that I had something good , what happens when it 's over , and going forward with my life . " The track was one of the final songs that Milian wrote about the break @-@ up as it " helped me get it all out " . While the record is about a break @-@ up , it focuses more on closure and moving past it . Milian and Cool & Dre used the melody of the Bone Thugs @-@ n @-@ Harmony song " Tha Crossroads " and changed the lyrics " and I 'm gonna miss everybody " to " and I 'm gonna tell everybody " . The other song , " Who 's Gonna Ride " , has a more street and gangster vibe , and contain more raw lyrics . Milian wrote the track with Dre , which she said helped because hip hop artists write about real things in their lives and are not afraid to say anything . While writing the track , Milian let her guard down and wrote what she was feeling and tried to be real . Lyrically , the song also deals with " the girls that come around and try to take your man . Or the groupie girls that are around , paying attention to the guys on TV that only hang out with them for those reasons . " Milian also said " Who 's Gonna Ride " was the hardest song to write because it was not safe , unlike previous songs she had written . The singer explained writing the lyrics was not hard , but the difficulty came from being real and actually writing about her true feelings . When writing the lyrics , Milian removed several lines that she thought were too harsh .

 So Amazin ' debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard 200 , selling 54 @,@ 000 copies in its first week and 163 @,@ 000 copies in total . Internationally , the album peaked at number 55 on the Swiss Albums Chart , 67 on the UK Albums Chart , and 139 on the France Albums Chart . The album 's lead single , " Say I " , featured rapper Young Jeezy and had a music video , directed by Ray Kay . The single peaked at number four in the UK , and number 21 in the United States . 
 In June 2006 , Milian 's representative confirmed that she had left Island Def Jam . Although she was dropped from the label , Milian continued to promote the album through live appearances , performing on Power 106 's Summer Splash . Milian hoped to take " Gonna Tell Everybody " , the proposed second single , to another label and shoot a video , but was not able to . Milian revealed in an interview with Rap @-@ Up that she was dropped a week after the release of her album . Milian stated that before the release of So Amazin ' , the label and L.A. Reid knew that the album would not have immediate large sales , since she was targeting a new urban audience , but promised to support her . However , after a week , L.A. Reid called to notify Milian that she had been dropped . The singer believed that it was a budget cut , and the label opted to spend money on Rihanna instead . Milian also dispelled rumors that she was originally offered Rihanna 's song " SOS " .

 The critical response to So Amazin ' was mixed . Metacritic gave the album a Metascore — a weighted average based on the impressions of a select 12 critical reviews — of 59 , signifying mixed or average reviews . David Peisner of Maxim gave the album three out of five stars and said that Milian 's " talent is real " , and commended her " silky and sassy " voice . He praised Cool & Dre 's " badass " production , as well as " intoxicating " lead single " Say I " . Clover Hope of Billboard wrote that Milian tried to transform from " sweet pop sweetheart " to " peppy urban <unk> " , but the album could not " pinpoint her true identity " and could " only [ scratch ] the surface of who she really is . " Hope praised lead single , " Say I " , describing it as " instantly rousing " . 
 Dan Gennoe of Yahoo ! Music UK said that the production by Cool & Dre ensured for " a cohesive whole , with a clear , unmistakable identity " . He praised single " Say I " , saying it " <unk> to a feisty ghetto strut and Shaft @-@ sized <unk> " , as well as " Twisted " , " Hot Boy " and " Just A Little Bit " . He described So Amazin ' as " almost the perfect R & B album " , only missing " a couple of killer singles " . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that while Milian claimed that she was " proudly displaying the various sides of her multifaceted personality " , he felt that " only personality displayed on So Amazin ' is that of her contemporaries and predecessors " . He felt that contrary to the album 's title , " So Amazin ' proves to be anything but " . 
 Andy Kellman , of review website Allmusic , felt that So Amazin ' was " Milian 's strongest album yet , if only by a narrow margin " . He said that the album was short on ideas , with Cool & Dre using beats from some of their recent hits . He felt that Milian 's weakness was ballads , which were " more like placeholders that merely apply some forced variety to the album " ; but described the club tracks as " perfectly functional and appealing " . Spence <unk> of IGN gave the album a 6 @.@ 9 out of 10 and said that " Milian glistens most brightly on the tracks that are the most stripped down , such as ' Gonna Tell Everybody ' " . He said given the nature of the style of music Milian was practicing , " there 's a fair share of rump shaking club jams offsetting the more slow tempo fare " . <unk> described single " Say I " as " a <unk> theatrical ditty " , and " Foolin ' " as one of the " few tracks that genuinely attempts to lift Milian up from the generic R & B / club stylings " . The reviewer found the overall sound was the album 's biggest flaw ; " the production rings with a sense of detached hollowness ... The result is an album severely lacking any of the warmth that usually accompanies R & B. Milian 's hauntingly beautiful voice deserves to be wrapped in a sunny glow of organic vibes . " Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters praised the album , " despite a few lyrical hiccups , a couple of lackluster hooks , and some obvious influences . "

 After the release of Aguilera 's sixth studio album , Bionic ( 2010 ) , which failed to generate her usual sales , she divorced from her husband Jordan Bratman , starred in a film called Burlesque , and recorded its accompanying soundtrack . The singer then became a coach on NBC 's singing contest show The Voice and appeared as a guest vocalist on Maroon 5 's single " Moves Like Jagger " ( 2011 ) , which spent four weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100 chart . Following these events , Aguilera announced that she wanted to record her seventh album , stating that she wanted high @-@ quality and personal songs to record . She stated that the album would be a " culmination of everything I 've experienced up until this point ... I 've been through a lot since the release of my last album , being on ( The Voice ) , having had a divorce ... This is all sort of a free rebirth for me . " She went on to say that " I 'm embracing many different things , but it 's all feel @-@ good , super @-@ expressive [ and ] super @-@ vulnerable . " She further expressed that the album would be about " self @-@ expression and freedom " because of the personal struggles she had overcome during the last couple of years . 
 On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2012 , Aguilera revealed that the album was taking a while to record because " I don 't like to just get songs from producers . I like them to come from a personal place ... I 'm very excited . It 's fun , exciting , introspective , it 's going to be great " . In an interview with Rolling Stone , Aguilera said that the album was a " very multi @-@ layered , very heartfelt record " reflecting different sides of her personality . On Lotus , Aguilera worked with new producers , notably Alex da Kid and Max Martin . Alex da Kid , who first teamed with Aguilera in the song " Castle Walls " from T.I. ' s No Mercy ( 2010 ) , commented about Aguilera 's approach in recording Lotus , " She definitely had a strong opinion , but she 'll go with the best idea in the room . That 's really rare for someone that 's had so much success . " Speaking about working with Max Martin , Aguilera said , " Max is legendary in the business . He 's known about me but we haven 't crossed paths . [ ... ] It 's taken us a decade in the same business and watching each other from a distance , so for us to now come together and respect each other 's work ethic and how we like to be heard and making a marriage out of it , I think ' Your Body ' is the best culmination of that . " 
 Aguilera announced via Twitter on September 12 , 2012 that the album would be titled Lotus . The album artwork was shot by fashion photographer Enrique <unk> . Aguilera unveiled the cover on October 5 , where she is shown nude with her long , blonde hair covering her nipples , while her vulva is shaded by a white light ; she extends her arms emerging from a lotus flower . It received a generally positive response from critics ; Tiffany Lee from Yahoo ! Music complimented Aguilera 's figure , while Sam Lansky from Idolator drew comparisons to the cover of her fourth studio album , Stripped ( 2002 ) . Lotus was released on November 13 , 2012 by RCA Records , but was leaked online on November 5 .

 Lotus received generally mixed reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 56 , based on 12 reviews . Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called it " a good start in the effort to refocus attention on Aguilera 's skills " , but observed " several tracks that sound mindlessly repetitive as sedentary listening experiences " . Q called it " generic " and felt that " nothing really stands out " . Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club felt that the album " often plays it safe " and accused Aguilera of " dumbing down her voice or lyrics for the sake of lightweight tunes or prevailing trends . " Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the album 's " self @-@ empowerment anthems ... as contradictory as they are unoriginal " and criticized its production for " digitally smother [ ing ] " Aguilera 's vocals and " draining all the emotion " . Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani asserted that because it is " Aguilera 's shortest album since her debut , it boasts less filler , but also fewer obvious standouts . " Jon Caramanica of The New York Times felt that the album 's conventional direction is " its biggest crime , more than its musical <unk> or its emphasis on bland self @-@ help lyrics or its reluctance to lean on [ ... ] Aguilera 's voice , the thing that makes her special " . Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone dismissed it as a " vitriol @-@ tsunami of a record " . 
 In a positive review , AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that Aguilera " feels comfortable in this familiar , slightly freshened territory " . Simon Price of The Independent felt that the album 's " best moments are its electro @-@ pop numbers " . Kitty Empire of The Observer characterized its subject matter as " wiffle of the highest order " , but wrote that " one of the pleasures of Aguilera is that she can use <unk> , even when talking the rot that fills women 's mags " . Although she criticized the album 's " upbeat pop anthems " , Melody Lau of Exclaim ! found Aguilera to be " reinvigorated " and felt that she " shines most when she 's direct , honest and vulnerable " . Celina Murphy of Hot Press felt that Lotus 's " safer " direction and Aguilera 's " default mode " makes the album an improvement from Bionic . At the end of 2012 , Lotus was ranked at number 17 on the list " 20 Best Pop Albums of 2012 " by Spin . In contrast , Entertainment Weekly named it the worst album of 2012 .

 = Abdul Amir al @-@ Jamri = 
 Sheikh Abdul Amir al @-@ Jamri ( pronunciation ; <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ ah @-@ <unk> @-@ al @-@ <unk> @-@ ree Arabic : <unk> <unk> الجمري ; 1 March 1938 – 18 December 2006 ) was one of the most prominent Shia clerics and opposition leaders in Bahrain . He was also a writer and a poet . 
 Born in the village of Bani Jamra , al @-@ Jamri became a Hussaini khatib ( Shia preacher ) after finishing primary school . At the age of 21 , he began his Islamic studies , first in Bahrain and later in the religious institute of Al Najaf , Iraq , where he remained for 11 years . He returned to Bahrain in 1973 and was elected to the newly formed parliament . The parliament was dissolved two years later by the Emir , Isa bin Salman al @-@ Khalifa , after it had rejected the State Security Law . In 1977 , al @-@ Jamri was appointed as a judge at the High Religious Court of Bahrain . He held the position until 1988 , when he was briefly arrested due to his criticism of the government . 
 Al @-@ Jamri is most notable for his role during the 1990s uprising in Bahrain . As the lead figure of the opposition , he succeeded in bringing Islamists , liberals and leftists together against the monarchy . The events began in the form of petitions in 1992 and 1994 calling for restoration of the parliament and reinstatement of the suspended constitution , but led to widespread violence and the death of 40 individuals . Due to his civil rights activity , al @-@ Jamri was imprisoned between April and September 1995 , before being arrested again in January 1996 and imprisoned until July 1999 , which was followed by a year and a half of house arrest . 
 In January 2001 , al @-@ Jamri was released along with other opposition activists . The new emir , Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa , proposed a reform plan , the National Action Charter of Bahrain , which was accepted by the opposition and later gained widespread popular support . A year later , Hamad issued a new constitution which al @-@ Jamri said fell short of the opposition 's demands . Disappointed , al @-@ Jamri soon fell ill , suffering from a series of strokes and eventually dying of multiple organ failure . 
 = = Early life and Islamic studies = = 
 Al @-@ Jamri was born in the village of Bani Jamra , Northern Bahrain , on 1 March 1938 . His full name was Abdul Amir bin Mansoor bin Mohammed bin <unk> bin Mohammed bin Hussain bin Ebrahim bin Makki bin Suleiman bin Makki al @-@ Jamri al @-@ Bahrani ( Arabic : <unk> بن منصور بن محمد بن <unk> بن محمد بن حسين بن إبراهيم بن <unk> بن سليمان بن <unk> الجمري <unk> ) , although he was also known by his kunya Abu Jameel ( Arabic : أبو <unk> ) . His father – known as Mansoor or Nasir – was a Quranic teacher , owner of a textile workshop , and head of a " devout Shia family " . Al @-@ Jamri 's father taught him the Quran and basics of Islamic prayer when he was 6 , although died four years later . Al @-@ Jamri finished formal education at Budaiya primary school when he was 12 , before becoming a Hussaini khatib ( Shia preacher ) , learning from other well @-@ known <unk> in his village such as his cousin , the renovator Shia khatib Mulla Atiya al @-@ Jamri . He also obtained a job in the Manama Souq , working there until 1962 . 
 In 1957 , al @-@ Jamri married his cousin 's granddaughter , Zahra ' Yousif Atiya al @-@ Jamri , who was 16 at the time . In his book The Story of My Life , al @-@ Jamri devoted a section to speak about his marriage , in which he described it as a happy one and praised his wife for her patience and loyalty . They had 10 children together : 7 sons and 3 daughters . One of their sons is Mansoor Al @-@ Jamri , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Al @-@ Wasat newspaper . 
 In 1959 , al @-@ Jamri began his religious studies in Bahrain . He was taught by Sheikh Abdulla al @-@ Bahrani ( died 1961 ) and Sheikh Baqir al @-@ <unk> . In 1962 , following the death of his mentor , al @-@ Jamri traveled to Iraq to study Islamic theology and law in the religious institute of Al Najaf . Mentored for two years by Ayatollah Mohammad Baqir al @-@ Sadr and Abu al @-@ Qasim al @-@ <unk> , he reached the stage of independent research ( <unk> al @-@ <unk> ; Arabic : <unk> <unk> ) , the highest level of study in religious seminaries . He also wrote several religious articles which were published in Iraqi newspapers and magazines . In the country , al @-@ Jamri used the pseudonym Abdulla Mansoor Mohammed in order to avoid trouble when passing through customs in Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Iraq , where it was believed that the prefix " Abdul " should only be used with the name of God . The pseudonym also helped him evade Iraq 's Ba 'athist regime of Saddam Hussein following an anti @-@ Ba 'athist speech which al @-@ Jamri gave in 1970 . Spending 11 years in Iraq , al @-@ Jamri returned to Bahrain in 1973 . Between 1973 and 1981 , al @-@ Jamri was a frequent host on Bahrain TV , giving religious talks on Islamic occasions such as Ramadan and Ashura . In 1985 , he founded a small <unk> in the mosque next to his house . 
 = = Member of Parliament = = 
 Bahrain became independent from the United Kingdom in 1971 and the Constituent Assembly of 1972 had drafted a new constitution by 1973 . Like his study colleague Isa Qassim , al @-@ Jamri initially wanted to complete his religious studies and did not care much about politics . His mentor in Iraq , Mohammad Baqir al @-@ Sadr , issued a binding fatwā for participation in the 1973 parliamentary election . Al @-@ Jamri and five others formed the " Religious Bloc " which adopted a wide program including supporting the labor 's union and demands , forbidding trade of alcoholic beverages , and separating men and women in education institutes . The bloc also called for prohibiting male doctors from treating female patients ( especially in pregnancy ) as well as other demands connected to traditional Islamic customs . Al @-@ Jamri was elected to the National Assembly of Bahrain , ranking second behind Isa Qassim . 
 In August 1975 , the constitution was suspended and the assembly dissolved by the Emir , Isa bin Salman al @-@ Khalifa , after it had rejected the State Security Law . The act – also known as " the precautionary law " – was proposed by the British adviser Ian Henderson . It gave police wide powers of arrest and allowed individuals to be held in prison without trial or charge for up to three years ( renewable ) for suspicion " that they might be a threat to the state " . Al @-@ Jamri was a member of a foreign relations committee , and an outspoken critic of the State Security Law . 
 = = 1977 – 1988 = = 
 In the period from 1975 to 2001 , the Emir ruled by decree . Human rights activists and opposition leaders made repeated allegations of systematic torture , the arbitrary arrest of thousands , and assassinations , all of which were denied by the authorities . Bahrain 's Shia population widely claimed that they were being discriminated against by the government , and that they were being treated as second class citizens . 
 = = = Judge = = = 
 In 1977 , the government offered al @-@ Jamri the opportunity to serve as a judge at the High Religious Court of Bahrain ( Shia branch ) . Al @-@ Jamri agreed after Abu al @-@ Qasim al @-@ <unk> issued him with a religious permit to do so . The decision was controversial within Bahrain , as many Shia clerics had refused to participate in the government @-@ run judiciary ever since its foundation in the 1920s . Al @-@ Jamri held the position until June 1988 , when he was suspended due to his criticism of the government . 
 = = = Political activism = = = 
 Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution , and continuing throughout the 1980s , the intensity of Bahrain 's political situation sharply increased . Al @-@ Jamri , who was then participating in several petitions , was questioned multiple times and put under strict surveillance by the Security and Intelligence Service . In 1984 , the Islamic Enlightenment institution , with which al @-@ Jamri was associated , was closed by the government . The government also closed other places of meeting and prohibited public seminars . Al @-@ <unk> however opened his house for daily meetings , also offering a weekly space for public debates ; he continued to do so despite several government attempts to stop him . 
 In 1988 , the situation came to a head when al @-@ Jamri ignored a final warning by the government . In June , he was dismissed from his job as a judge . In August , his son @-@ in @-@ law Abduljalil Khalil was arrested and sentenced to seven years imprisonment . In September , his elder son Mohamed Jameel was arrested and sentenced to ten years . The authorities then ordered al @-@ Jamri 's arrest ; on 6 September , Colonel Adel <unk> and a number of security forces arrived at his house . Al @-@ Jamri 's wife rushed to the nearby mosque and called people from its speakers . Amid neighbors ' protests , security forces decided to let al @-@ <unk> go after only an hour 's detention . 
 = = Role during the 1990s uprising = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 There was a time of civil strife in Bahrain from 1994 to 1999 , during which leftists , liberals and Islamists joined forces to demand democratic reforms . The uprising was the largest in the country 's history , and included widespread demonstrations and violence . 
 In 1992 , a petition was signed by 280 leading figures in civil society , demanding the restoration of parliament , reinstatement of the suspended constitution , the release of political prisoners , and the start of a reconciliation dialogue . The government rejected their demands and instead set up a thirty @-@ member appointed " Shura council " assigned with " commenting " on government proposed legislation . In 1994 , another petition was launched with the same demands , this time open to all citizens . Organizers said that they had collected over 20 @,@ 000 signatures . 
 Violence broke out in June 1994 when riot police used tear gas on 1 @,@ 500 demonstrators who had organized a sit @-@ in in front of the Ministry of Labor . The protesters were campaigning against the increasing rate of unemployment , which had reached 15 percent . Over the following years , many opposition leaders were arrested and others exiled . Some protesters used Molotov cocktails to attack " police stations , banks and commercial properties " . Riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets , some of which were fired at the crowd from police helicopters . It was also reported that police used live ammunition in some cases . Overall , about forty people were killed , including several detainees who were in police custody ( allegedly due to torture ) , and at least three policemen . 
 During the uprising , al @-@ Jamri " rose to prominence " , becoming the lead figure among the opposition , who saw him as " their father figure and spiritual mentor . " To the Shia , he was their " spiritual leader " . He was a " chief architect " and a signatory of the 1992 and 1994 petitions . He was also the informal leader of the U.K.-based Bahrain Freedom Movement . Al @-@ Jamri , himself a Shia Islamist , had good relations with secular and liberal opposition forces and united them into " an effective opposition movement " . Due to his civil rights activity , the pro @-@ democracy cleric was arrested and placed under house arrest for years . 
 = = = First arrest = = = 
 In 1995 , following clashes between security forces and students , the government accused al @-@ Jamri of having links to Iran and seeking to establish an " Islamic republic " in Bahrain . Al @-@ Jamri denied the accusations . Nevertheless , on 1 April the government imposed a blockade on al @-@ Jamri 's home of Bani Jamra , placing him and 18 members of his family under house arrest . At least one man was killed and 16 others injured during clashes with police . That day became known locally as the Black Saturday . Two weeks later , al @-@ Jamri was transferred to a detention center . Along with other opposition figures he was released on 25 September 1995 , following a deal with the government to calm down the situation in return for opening up talks on the restoration of parliament . Tens of thousands of Bahrainis gathered to welcome al @-@ Jamri following his release . He gave a speech in which he promised to stay loyal to the hopes and sufferings of the Bahraini people . 
 = = = Second arrest , trial and conviction = = = 
 On 23 October , al @-@ Jamri and other released opposition activists began a 10 @-@ day hunger strike in his house to protest what they called the government 's failure to fulfill its pledges . Tens of thousands gathered in solidarity with the activists on the final day of the hunger strike ( 1 November ) . On 21 January 1996 al @-@ Jamri was detained again along with 7 other opposition leaders , including Abdulwahab Hussain and Hassan Mushaima , following the collapse of the talks . The arrests provoked further unrest . The activists denied the charges of forming a militia group called " Bahraini Hizbullah " or receiving support from Iran . 
 Al @-@ Jamri spent 3 and a half years in prison , during which he allegedly spent the first 9 months in solitary confinement and was closely observed during the remaining period . On 21 February 1999 , about three years after his arrest , al @-@ Jamri 's trial before the State Security Court began . On 7 July , the court convicted him on charges of " spying and inciting unrest against the royal family " . Al @-@ Jamri was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and fined <unk> million ( US $ 15 million ) . British politician George Galloway , Human Rights Watch , International Pen and Amnesty International led campaigns in solidarity with al @-@ Jamri . The latter also named him a prisoner of conscience . 
 = = = Release , reconciliation and disappointment = = = 
 Emir Isa bin Salman died suddenly on 6 March and was succeeded by his eldest son , Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa . The new emir pardoned al @-@ Jamri and released him a day after his conviction ( 8 July ) , but placed him under house arrest until 23 January 2001 . Before getting pardoned , al @-@ Jamri had to appear on <unk> and read a " humiliating letter of apology " to the Emir . Repeated meetings between commissioners of the Emir and al @-@ Jamri were held during the house arrest period . Subsequent days saw the release of further political prisoners , and exiles were allowed to return . On 8 February , al @-@ Jamri and 3 other opposition leaders — Abdulla al @-@ <unk> , Abdulwahab Hussain and Ali <unk> — met with the emir to discuss his reform plans , the National Action Charter of Bahrain . 
 The Charter called for the introduction of a constitutional monarchy , an independent judiciary , and a bicameral legislature composed of a lower house of elected representatives and an upper house of appointed legislators . The Charter also granted equal rights between men and women , and recognised all Bahraini citizens as having equal political rights , including the entitlement to elections and political candidacy . In the 8 February meeting , the government promised that " the new political arrangements will not invalidate the 1973 constitution and that the upper appointed house will be for consultation only . " The next day , after leading Friday prayer , al @-@ Jamri delivered a famous speech , starting with " Allah is my witness , I have missed you as much as Jacob missed Joseph " , before Abdulwahab announced that the opposition had decided to accept the reform plan . The National Action Charter was voted on in a referendum on 14 and 15 February , gaining massive popular support ( 98 @.@ 4 % ) . In November 2001 , the Al Wefaq Shia political society was founded , with al @-@ Jamri being seen as its mentor . 
 On 14 February 2002 , the Emir introduced the new constitution of 2002 , which gave him wide @-@ ranging powers and gave the upper appointed house more powers than the elected lower house , including the right to legislate . The " honeymoon " period between the opposition and government was over ; al @-@ Jamri stated his disappointment with the new constitution , stating that it fell short of the opposition 's demands . " [ T ] his is not the type of parliament we had demanded , " he said . 
 = = Illness and death = = 
 Then under house arrest , in May 2000 al @-@ Jamri suffered a heart attack . He was taken to the Bahrain Defence Force Hospital , where he underwent surgery . During his stay at the hospital , he was visited by the King and Prime Minister . In May 2002 , al @-@ Jamri traveled to Germany for spinal surgery . While undergoing medical checkups , it was discovered he had a thrombus behind his eye , which had developed when he was in prison . Following the surgery he suffered a stroke , also developing kidney problems and a blood infection , soon falling into a coma . He woke from the coma on 30 June , but shortly after suffered a second stroke , resulting in internal bleeding , and incapacitating him for the rest of his life . 
 On 27 January 2003 , al @-@ Jamri was transferred from Germany to Sultan bin Abdulaziz Humanitarian City in Saudi Arabia , where his medical condition improved slightly . He returned to Bahrain on 12 July and was welcomed by hundreds of his supporters . His medical condition deteriorated again as he suffered from repeated respiratory problems and another stroke , and in the end he lost the ability to speak . In the early morning of 18 December 2006 , al @-@ Jamri was rushed by ambulance from his home to Salmaniya Medical Complex , where he was announced dead . The cause of death was heart and kidney failure .
