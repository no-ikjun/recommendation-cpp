 Folk Singer is the fourth studio album by Muddy Waters , released in April 1964 by Chess Records . The album features Waters on acoustic guitar , backed by Willie Dixon on string bass , Clifton James on drums , and Buddy Guy on acoustic guitar . It is Waters 's only all @-@ acoustic album . Numerous reissues of Folk Singer include bonus tracks from two subsequent sessions , in April 1964 and October 1964 . 
 Despite not charting in any country , Folk Singer received critical acclaim ; most reviewers praised its high @-@ quality sound , especially on remastered versions , as well as the instrumentation . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 280 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time .

 After his successful performance at Newport Jazz Festival and tours through America , Chess Records encouraged Waters to record songs for a new studio album . Before the recording , several musicians had Waters 's band , and other had joined Waters . Andrew Stephens , who played at Newport , was replaced in the following years with numerous bassists . The drummer Francis Clay was replaced by Willie " Big Eyes " Smith , who played in the Muddy Waters Junior Band . Pat Hare was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife ( while in jail , he formed the band Sounds Incarcerated ) . Hare was replaced by a succession of guitarists , including James " Pee Wee " Madison , who played a right @-@ handed guitar left handed . Madison played guitar on some of the reissue bonus tracks , as did Sammy Lawhorn . Lawhorn allegedly suffered from narcolepsy ( Elvin Bishop denied this , believing that Lawhorn 's sleepiness was due to alcoholism ) . The electric guitarist Buddy Guy , who had recorded with Waters on Blues from Big Bill 's Copacabana , released by Chess in 1963 , was hired . Guy had been discovered by Waters shortly after Guy arrived in Chicago from Louisiana .

 Folk Singer is an " unplugged " recording and differs from his earlier albums , which featured an electric blues sound . The title of the album was chosen by Chess Records because it was recorded during the time when folk music was popular . In order to appeal to fans of folk music , Chess recorded a more acoustic album with two acoustic guitarists . Buddy Guy was hired as the second guitarist . Other guitarists played on bonus tracks . Guy played on all original songs , except the last song , " Feel Like Going Home " , together with Waters . 
 The recording took place at the Tel Mar Recording Studios , in Chicago , in September 1963 , and was produced by Willie Dixon . The original vinyl release includes nine songs , most of which are performed at a slower tempo , with the exception of the uptempo " Good Morning Little Schoolgirl " . During recording , Waters emphasized his singing with hums and sighs . 
 = = Releases and tour = = 
 The original album was released as an LP in April 1964 by Chess Records . Since then , numerous record labels have released different versions on CD , with different bonus tracks from Waters 's 1964 sessions . One of the first CD versions was released in 1993 by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab , containing two bonus tracks , " You Can 't Lose What You Never Had " and " The Same Thing . " The 1999 remastered version contains five bonus tracks , " The Same Thing " , " You Can 't Lose What You Never Had " , " My John the Conqueror Root " , " Short Dress Woman " and " Put <unk> Your Lay Away " . 
 The supporting tour through Europe , the second American Folk Blues Festival , began one month after the recording of Folk Singer . The first gig out of seventeen took place in London ; other performances were in Belgium , Germany , France and Denmark . In London , Waters began with the unreleased " My Captain " , followed by " Rollin ' Stone " . In keeping with the folk theme , quiet versions of " Five Long Years " , " Blow Wind Blow " , " Trouble No More " , " My Home Is in the Delta " and " Got My Mojo Working " were performed . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 In a contemporary review , Down Beat magazine found Waters 's singing " forced and artificial " , writing that Folk Singer suffers from a major flaw : " He only begins to come close to the power and unforced intensity of the original numbers and style from time to time , as on ' You Gonna Need My Help ' and ' My Home Is in the Delta ' " . In a retrospective review , Cub Koda , writing for AllMusic was more enthusiastic , deeming the record 's sound fresh and vital . In 2003 , Rolling Stone ranked Folk Singer number 280 on its list of the " 500 Greatest Albums of <unk> " , writing that the " unplugged " playing was pioneering and has since been " beloved by blues and folk fans alike " . In a 1994 issue of Rolling Stone , a reviewer wrote , " ... There aren 't too many blues albums that qualify as audiophile recordings , but Muddy Waters Folk Singer surely does . A wonderfully intimate session , it delivers Waters ' voice in all its power and subtlety , while rendering his guitar work ... with such vivid realism , you would think you were sitting in the studio ....

 = Admiral Nakhimov @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Admiral Nakhimov @-@ class cruisers were a group of four light cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy just before World War I began in 1914 . Construction was interrupted by the Russian Revolution and only two of the ships were eventually completed well after the end of the Russian Civil War by the Soviets . Chervona Ukraina was the first ship completed and was built to essentially the original design . Krasnyi Kavkaz was much modified and completed five years after Chervona Ukraina . Both ships participated in the Sieges of Odessa and Sevastopol after the Germans invaded Russia in June 1941 . They ferried troops into the cities , evacuated wounded and bombarded the besieging German troops . Chervona Ukraina was bombed and sunk by dive bombers in November during one of these missions and Krasny Kavkaz was badly damaged by the same type of aircraft in January 1942 . After her lengthy repairs were completed , the ship transported reinforcements to cities on the Black Sea coast during the Battle of the Caucasus . She was reclassified as a training ship in 1947 before she was sunk as a target in 1956 . Chervona Ukraina was salvaged in 1947 and then became a hulked . She became a target ship in 1950 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The ships were essentially enlarged versions of the Svetlana @-@ class cruisers , modified after consultations with the Scottish firm of John Brown & Company . 
 As designed , the ships displaced 7 @,@ 600 long tons ( 7 @,@ 700 t ) . They had an length at the waterline of 535 ft 6 in ( 163 @.@ 2 m ) , a beam of 51 ft 6 in ( 15 @.@ 7 m ) and a mean draft of about 18 ft 3 in ( 5 @.@ 6 m ) . They were powered by four Brown @-@ Curtis steam turbines , each driving one shaft , which developed a total of 55 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 41 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 29 @.@ 5 knots ( 54 @.@ 6 km / h ; 33 @.@ 9 mph ) . The engines were powered by 14 Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers . Four were coal @-@ fired while the rest were mixed @-@ firing . The ship carried a maximum of 540 long tons ( 550 t ) of coal and an additional 690 long tons ( 700 t ) of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate in the mixed @-@ firing boilers . At full capacity , she could steam for 1 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 200 km ; 1 @,@ 400 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . The ships ' crew numbered 630 officers and men . 
 The ships ' main armament consisted of fifteen 55 @-@ caliber 130 mm / 55 B7 Pattern 1913 guns in single mounts . Six of these were mounted in casemates . Her anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) armament consisted of four 63 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) guns . They also mounted two submerged 457 @-@ millimeter ( 18 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes . The ships were intended to carry one seaplane . 
 The cruisers ' waterline belt consisted of 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of Krupp cemented armor and above it was an upper belt 1 inch ( 25 mm ) thick . The gun shields were protected by 1 inch ( 25 mm ) of armour . Each of the armored decks was .75 inches ( 19 mm ) thick . The armor of the conning tower was 3 inches ( 76 mm ) thick . 
 In 1917 , the Naval General Staff decided to add another seaplane and a crane to handle them . It also decided to upgrade Admiral Nakhimov 's anti @-@ aircraft guns to 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) weapons and the other ships of the class would receive 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) AA guns . Neither decision was implemented before construction was suspended .

 = = Construction and modifications = = 
 The first pair of ships was ordered in March 1914 and the second in October . The hulls of all four ships were to be built by the Russud Shipyard and fitted out by the Naval Shipyard . Construction was slowed by the Russian Revolution and the hulls of both Admiral Nakhimov and Admiral Lazarev were seized by the Germans when they captured Nikolayev in 1918 . They were later turned over the Allies in November in accordance with the Armistice . The Allies in turn handed them over to the White Russians the following year who assigned them to Wrangel 's fleet . Admiral Nakhimov was run aground by the dock workers while fitting @-@ out in Nikolayev later in 1919 to prevent her use by the Whites . She was later salvaged in 1920 by the Bolsheviks . Neither Admiral Istomin nor Admiral Kornilov were in shape to be completed after years of neglect and they were scrapped in 1922 – 23 . 
 Admiral Nakhimov was renamed Chervona Ukraina , ( <unk> <unk> – Red Ukraine ) on 26 December 1922 by the Soviets and completed on 21 March 1927 . She was mostly finished to the original design with some of the modifications proposed by the Naval General Staff in 1917 . A pair of cranes was fitted abreast the central funnel to lift the pair of seaplanes on and off the water and the area immediately abaft that funnel was modified to stow the aircraft . Her foremast was converted from a pole to a tripod and the submerged torpedo tubes were removed and replaced by four triple 533 @-@ millimetre ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo mounts carried on her deck , two on each broadside . Chervona Ukraina was given a lengthy refit in 1939 – 41 where her aircraft and their handling equipment was removed and fire @-@ control equipment was modernized . Her anti @-@ aircraft armament was replaced by three twin Italian Minizini 100 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) gun mounts , ten single 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns and seven 12 @.@ 7 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) anti @-@ aircraft machine guns . One pair of her torpedo tubes was also removed . 
 Admiral Lazarev was renamed Krasnyi Kavkaz ( Красный <unk> – Red Caucasus ) on 14 December 1926 . The Soviets intended to upgrade her armament and finally settled on the new 57 @-@ caliber 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) B @-@ 1 @-@ K gun in four single gun turrets , two at each end . Her superstructure was massively revised to accommodate these turrets and all of her original armament removed , as was her forward funnel . Her anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of four 30 @-@ caliber 76 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter ( 3 in ) Lender guns mounted between her funnels . Like her sister , she also received four triple torpedo mounts . She was given an aircraft @-@ handling crane , but a catapult wasn 't installed aft of her rear funnel until 1935 when a Heinkel catapult was imported from Germany . She was also fitted for mine rails with a capacity of up to 120 mines . 
 She was refitted before Operation Barbarossa , probably about 1940 , her catapult was removed , and her anti @-@ aircraft armament was greatly increased . Her four 76 @.@ 2 mm Lender AA guns were exchanged for four twin 50 @-@ caliber 100 mm AA mounts and she received four single mounts for the semi @-@ automatic 45 mm 21 @-@ K gun were fitted as well as six 12 @.@ 7 mm AA machine guns . Two single mounts for 76 @.@ 2 mm 34 @-@ K guns were also fitted . While under repair at Poti in late 1942 she landed her aft pair of torpedo tubes and received two more Minizini mounts salvaged from the sunken Chervona Ukraina . Ten single mounts for the naval version of the 37 mm AA gun was also fitted . By 1944 she was also carrying one quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun MK III mount on top of each of her superfiring main gun turrets and she may have been using Oerlikon 20 mm cannon .

 The light cruiser Komintern collided with Krasnyi Kavkaz in May 1932 , shortly after she was commissioned , and badly damaged her bow . It was extensively rebuilt and increased her overall length by over 11 meters ( 36 ft 1 in ) . Both ships made port visits to Turkey , Greece and Italy before World War II . 
 Chervona Ukraina , in company with Krasnyi Kavkaz , Komintern and a number of destroyers , laid down a defensive minefield protecting the Black Sea Fleet base at Sevastopol on 22 June 1941 . They provided gunfire support to Soviet forces during the Siege of Odessa and escorted convoys bringing reinforcements into Odessa . Krasny Kavkaz transported one battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment from Sevastopol in a successful amphibious assault behind Romanian lines to destroy Romanian coastal batteries near Fontanka and Dofinovka . Both ships escorted convoys from Odessa to Sevastopol in October when the evacuation of Odessa was ordered . During the Siege of Sevastopol , they provided gunfire support and evacuated cut @-@ off troops from elsewhere in the Crimea into Sevastopol and brought in reinforcements from Caucasian ports . Chervona Ukraina was hit three times by bombs from German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive @-@ bombers on 12 November 1941 , but didn 't sink until the next day after her crew was ordered to abandon her . Her guns were salvaged and most of the guns and crew were incorporated into the port 's defenses , 
 Krasnyi Kavkaz continued to ferry reinforcements into Sevastopol . During the Kerch @-@ Feodosiya Operation the ship sailed into the harbor of Feodosiya on 29 December 1941 , landed reinforcements , and provided gunfire support for Soviet troops already ashore . In early January 1942 , she was severely damaged by German dive bombers . She made it to Novorossiysk , escorted by the destroyer <unk> , where she was patched up enough to make to Poti where more permanent repairs could be made . These took until October 1942 and the opportunity was taken to reinforce her anti @-@ aircraft armament . 
 She was awarded the Guards title on 3 April in recognition of her performance . Between 20 and 23 October , she helped to transport 12 @,@ 600 men from Poti to Tuapse to reinforce the defenses there . On the night of 4 February 1943 the Soviets made a series of amphibious landings to the west of Novorossiysk , behind German lines . Krasnyi Kavkaz provided fire support for the main landing , but the Soviet troops there were wiped out by 6 February . The loss of three destroyers attempting to interdict the German evacuation of the Taman Bridgehead on 6 October 1943 caused Stalin to forbid the deployment of large naval units without his express permission and this meant the end of the ship 's active participation in the war .

 Chervona Ukraina was raised on 3 November 1947 , repaired , and used as a training hulk until 30 October 1950 when she became a target ship . On 10 May 1952 , she was grounded on a spit to serve as a fixed target . Little is known about Krasny Kavkaz 's activities after the end of the war other than she was redesignated as a training ship on 13 May 1947 . She was sunk as a target ship by SS @-@ N @-@ 1 missiles on 21 November 1952 . 
 = Altes Stadthaus , Bonn = 
 The Altes Stadthaus is a former administration building in Bonn , built for the French occupation forces after World War I. It was designed by the Munich architect German <unk> in 1922 . Construction was completed in 1924 – 25 . The building most recently served as a public library and administration building . As of 2012 , the Altes Stadthaus is being renovated and extended as a " House of Learning " ( German : " Haus der Bildung " ) , which will accommodate the community college and the library . 
 = = Location and architecture = = 
 German <unk> designed the building to make an impressive entry point to the city on the north side . It was erected on a bastion that remained from the former city walls , opposite the University of Bonn , which occupies the former residential palace of the prince @-@ elector of Cologne on the site of the south bastion . A curved section adjoins <unk> on the south side and defines the remaining bastion as a garden space . Along with the " Old Toll @-@ House " , this bastion is one of the few parts of the old fortifications accessible to the public . In the 1980s , a new access route was created from the <unk> , and the courtyard was landscaped and trees planted . In the late 1990s part of this small park was turned into a playground . 
 The Altes Stadthaus is arranged around two rectangular internal courtyards . The main section , which faces <unk> Platz , has a mansard roof and is framed by four @-@ storey turrets . The main entrance is at the southwest corner of Bottlerplatz , and the building bridges <unk> , with two low arched openings . <unk> 's building was intended to be the nucleus of future development in the centre of Bonn . However , the only other construction there was the tax office on the corner of <unk> Platz and <unk> , built in 1937 , and some further building on Bottlerplatz . After the Neues Stadthaus — the new city administration building — was built , the main floor of the section of Altes Stadthaus facing <unk> Platz was rebuilt to house the library . In the course of this restructuring , the two courtyards were roofed over and several interior walls replaced with columns . The east wing of the building was demolished to make way for a C & A department store . 
 = = History = = 
 After World War II , the <unk> für <unk> <unk> was housed in the Altes Stadthaus between 1949 and 1957 , primarily in the now demolished section of the building . 
 In the summer of 2006 , the mayor and the speaker of the Social Democratic Party of Germany group in the city council announced plans to sell the Altes Stadthaus , relocating the library , the community college , and the city museum to a new building in <unk> , near the station . The Stadthaus was to be used as retail space . 
 = = = House of Learning = = = 
 The announcement to sell the building sparked a fierce public debate . The Green Party , at the time in a coalition with the SPD , strongly disagreed with the plan . The Christian Democratic Union party held a meeting in October 2006 . The director of the Bonn Women 's Museum , Marianne <unk> , accused the initiators of the plan of selling off public property and underestimating the value of cultural heritage . 
 At the end of October 2006 , a citizens ' group was formed to promote the creation of a " House of Learning " ( German : " Haus der Bildung " ) at Bottlerplatz . The group demanded that the existing building and library should be kept and renovated . 
 At its session of 23 November 2006 , the planning committee of the city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large @-@ scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark . The report , which was presented at the end of December , recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing the library , and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600 m ² . This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building , which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s , particularly in its blocky ground floor . Changes to the upper floors , which remained largely in their original condition , were not recommended . 
 On 21 January 2007 , the SPD and CDU city councillors announced that they had agreed to house the " Haus der Bildung " in the Altes Stadthaus . The building will be extended to accommodate it . On 31 January 2007 , the city council voted to accept this plan , with Greens , Citizens ' Coalition , CDU and SPD members voting for it . The cost of the necessary remodelling and renovations is expected to exceed € 19 million . 
 An architectural contest concluded in October 2008 ; the entry of the Alexander <unk> architecture firm of Berlin was chosen . The adjacent office building , the <unk> , was demolished and on its site an extension to the Stadthaus is being erected that will incorporate a new main entrance . The work was planned to be completed in 2013 . 
 = Belenggu = 
 <unk> ( Perfected Spelling : Belenggu ; translated to English as Shackles ) is a novel by Indonesian author Armijn Pane . The novel follows the love triangle between a doctor , his wife , and his childhood friend , which eventually causes each of the three characters to lose the ones they love . Originally published by the literary magazine Poedjangga Baroe in three instalments from April to June 1940 , it was the magazine 's only published novel . It was also the first Indonesian psychological novel . 
 Belenggu was based on themes present in two of Pane 's early short stories : " Barang Tiada Berharga " ( " Worthless Thing " ; 1935 ) and " Lupa " ( " Forget " ; 1936 ) . The resulting novel , written to represent a stream of consciousness and using ellipses and monologues to show internal struggle , was very different from earlier Indonesian novels . Unlike said works , which kept to traditional themes such as good versus evil , Belenggu mainly focused on its characters ' psychological conflict . It also showed modernity and traditionalism as a binary system , unable to reach a compromise . 
 After completion , Belenggu was offered to the Dutch colonial government 's state publisher , Balai Pustaka , in 1938 , but rejected as " immoral " . It was then picked up by Poedjangga Baroe . Initial critical reception to the novel was mixed . Proponents argued that it served as an honest representation of the internal conflicts faced by Indonesian intellectuals , while opponents dismissed the novel as " pornographic " because of its inclusion of prostitution and adultery as normal facets of life . Later reviews have been more positive : in 1976 , the writer Muhammad Balfas called Belenggu " in every respect the best novel of pre @-@ war Indonesian literature " . The novel has been translated into several languages , including into English in 1989 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The first modern Indonesian novels published by the state @-@ owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies Balai Pustaka were often written to show intergenerational conflict and conflict between traditional ( adat ) and modern culture . These novels , published beginning in the 1920s , spearheaded the use of Indonesian as a national language . This national awakening , which was also realised through political actions , was followed in July 1933 with the establishment of the literary magazine Poedjangga Baroe ( New Writer ) . The literary magazine , which Belenggu 's author Armijn Pane helped establish , was the first written mainly in Indonesian and with exclusively Indonesian editors . 
 Of the staff and contributors to Poedjangga Baroe , Pane was one of the biggest proponents for Westernisation . While others , such as his elder brother Sanusi , stressed the need for " Asian " values , the younger Pane disregarded conventional Indonesian morality . The literary historian Heather Sutherland writes that this may have been a result of Pane 's education at a school for Dutch children ; the others received Dutch @-@ language education for Indonesians . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The novel begins as Sukartono ( Tono ) , a Dutch @-@ trained doctor , and his wife Sumartini ( Tini ) , residents of Batavia ( modern day Jakarta ) , are suffering a marital breakdown . Tono is busy treating his patients , leaving no time for him to be with Tini . In response , Tini has become active in numerous social organisations and women 's groups , leaving her little time to deal with household work . This further distances Tono from her , as he expects her to behave like a traditional wife and be waiting for him at home , with dinner ready , when he returns from work . 
 One day , Tono receives a call from a Miss Eni , who asks him to treat her at a hotel . After Tono arrives at the hotel where Eni is staying , he discovers that she is actually his childhood friend Rohayah ( Yah ) . Yah , who has had romantic feelings for Tono since childhood , begins seducing him , and after a while he accepts her advances . The two begin furtively meeting , often taking long walks at the port Tanjung Priok . When Tini goes to Surakarta to attend a women 's congress , Tono decides to stay at Yah 's house for a week . 
 While at Yah 's , Tono and Yah discuss their pasts . Tono reveals that after he graduated from elementary school in Bandung , where he studied with Yah , he attended medical school in Surabaya and married Tini for her beauty . Meanwhile , Yah was forced to marry an older man and move to Palembang . After deciding that life as a wife was not for her , she moved to Batavia and became a prostitute , before serving as a Dutchman 's mistress for three years . Tono falls further in love with Yah , as he feels that she is more likely to be a proper wife for him ; Yah , however , does not consider herself ready for marriage . 
 Tono , a fan of traditional kroncong music , is asked to judge a singing competition at Gambir Market . While there , he discovers that Yah is also his favourite singer , who sings under the pseudonym Siti Hayati . At Gambir , he also meets with his old friend Hartono , a political activist with the political party <unk> , who enquires about Tini . On a later date , Hartono visits Tono 's home and meets Tini . It is revealed that Tini was romantically involved with Hartono while the two of them were in university , where Tini surrendered her virginity to him ; this action , unacceptable in traditional culture , made her disgusted with herself and unable to love . Hartono had made the situation worse by breaking off their relationship through a letter . When Hartono asks her to take him back , Tini refuses . 
 Tini discovers that Tono has been having an affair , and is furious . She then goes to meet Yah . However , after a long talk she decides that Yah is better for Tono and tells the former prostitute to marry him ; Tini then moves back to Surabaya , leaving Tono in Batavia . However , Yah feels that she would only ruin Tono 's respected status as a doctor because of her history . She decides to move to New Caledonia , leaving a note for Tono as well as a record with a song recorded especially for him as a way of saying goodbye . On the way to New Caledonia , Yah pines for Tono and hears his voice calling from afar , giving a speech on the radio . Tono , now alone , dedicates himself to his work in an attempt to fill the void left in his heart . 
 = = Characters = = 
 Sukartono 
 Sukartono ( abbreviated as Tono ) is a doctor , Tini 's husband and Yah 's lover . He treats poor patients for free and thus is well @-@ liked by the general populace . He is also a big fan of traditional kroncong music : in medical school he preferred to sing rather than study , and as a doctor he keeps a radio in his treatment room . Suffering from loneliness in his loveless marriage with the modern @-@ minded Tini , he becomes involved with Yah , whom he perceives as being more willing to play the traditional wife . However , when Tini and Yah leave him , he is left alone . 
 The Australian scholar of Indonesian literature A. Johns writes that Tono 's inner turmoil is caused by his inability to understand Tini , Yah , or the bacteria which he must kill to cure his patients . 
 Sumartini 
 Sumartini ( abbreviated as Tini ) is Tono 's ultra @-@ modern wife . While in university , she was very popular and enjoyed partying . During this time she lost her virginity to Hartono , an act which is viewed as unacceptable in traditional Indonesian culture ; when Hartono left her , Tini became increasingly aloof and distant from men . After marrying Tono , she felt increasingly lonely and became involved in social work as an effort to give her life meaning . After learning of Tono 's infidelity and seeing that Yah could take better care of him , Tini leaves her husband and moves to Surabaya . 
 Yoseph <unk> Taum , a lecturer at Sanata Dharma University in Yogyakarta , views Tini 's aloof nature as a major force driving Tono to Yah ; her lifestyle , of which Tono is not a part , alienates him and drives him to find a more traditional woman . Tham Seong Chee , a political scientist from Singapore , views her as a weak @-@ willed character , unwilling to act before meeting Hartono again and even then unable to solve her marital difficulties with Tono . He also sees her as being fettered by her own values , which are incompatible with those held by the general Indonesian populace . The Indonesian writer and literary critic Goenawan Mohamad views her as driven in part by the stress placed on her by her husband 's expectations . 
 Rohayah 
 Rohayah ( also known by the pseudonyms <unk> Eni and Siti Hayati ; abbreviated Yah ) is Tono 's childhood friend and later lover , as well as a popular kroncong singer . After Tono , who is three years her elder , graduated from elementary school , Yah was forcibly married to a man twenty years her senior and brought from Bandung to Palembang . After escaping him and returning to Bandung , where she found that her parents had died , she moved to Batavia and became a prostitute ; she also became a popular kroncong singer under the pseudonym Siti Hayati . When she discovers that Tono has become a doctor in Batavia , she pretends to be a patient and seduces him . Although the two fall deeply in love , Yah decides to leave Tono and move to New Caledonia because she feels that society would view the doctor poorly if he married a former prostitute . 
 Tham sees Yah as being a good match for Tono in personality , as she shows a willingness to serve as the traditional wife . The American scholar of Indonesian literature Harry Aveling writes that Yah 's employment as a prostitute was likely a capitulation by Pane to cultural constraints ; Indonesian readers at the time would not have accepted Tono having an affair with someone of the same socio @-@ economic status . Mohamad describes her as being fatalistic and notes that she downplays her past by saying that any of a thousand girls in Tanjung Priok could tell the same story ; he found her touching without being melodramatic , and notes that Yah was the first prostitute featured portrayed sympathetically in an Indonesian work . 
 Hartono 
 Hartono is Tini 's lover from university ; he was also Tono 's friend . After hearing that Tini enjoys partying , he approaches her and they begin dating . After they have sex , he breaks off their relationship through a letter . He then drops out of university and becomes involved with the nascent nationalist movement , following future @-@ president Sukarno ; these acts cause his family to disown him . He later comes to Batavia to search for Tono and is surprised to find that Tini has married the doctor . Hartono asks her to run away with him , but she refuses . He then goes to Surabaya . 
 Clive Christie , a lecturer on Southeast Asian Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London , describes Hartono as the only overtly political character in the novel . 
 Women 's group 
 The various members of Tini 's women 's group , including Mrs. <unk> , Mrs. Padma , Mrs. <unk> , and Aminah , aid her in planning different social events . Mrs. <unk> is Tini 's friend from university . Aminah was one of Tini 's competitors for Tono and enjoys interfering in the couple 's lives . The other two disapprove of Tini 's <unk> and her lack of attention to Tono .

 Tono and Tini are served by two men , Karno and Abdul . Karno , Tono 's loyal manservant , dislikes Tini and considers her overly emotional . Abdul is their driver , who usually drives Tono to meet his patients .

 Bakri Siregar , an Indonesian literary critic associated with the socialist literary organisation Lekra , notes that Pane was influenced in part by Sigmund Freud 's theories on psychoanalysis ; he writes that it is most evident in the dialogue , especially that of Tini . Taum , while noting psychoanalysis ' influence , notes that the novel follows the individual characters stream of consciousness , which gives the reader a greater understanding of the characters and their conflicts . The novel was written in the middle of the writer 's career , and two of Pane 's earlier short stories , " Barang Tiada Berharga " ( " Worthless Thing " ; 1935 ) and " Lupa " ( " Forget " ; 1936 ) , contained plot points used in Belenggu . " Barang Tiada Berharga " also dealt with a doctor and his wife , named Pardi and <unk> , who were characterised in a similar manner as Sukartono and Sumartini , while " Lupa " introduced the main character Sukartono . As the reigning Dutch colonial government forbade the involvement of politics in literature , Pane minimised the explicit effects of colonialism in the novel . Taum writes that Belenggu 's theme of contrasting modernity and traditionalism may have been influenced by , or even written as a response to , Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana 's 1936 novel Layar Terkembang ( With Sails Unfurled ) , which dealt with a similar theme but fully supported modernisation . 
 = = Style = = 
 Belenggu uses ellipses and internal monologues heavily to represent the main characters ' turmoil ; the Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw calls it a " three @-@ pronged interior monologue " , noting that the novel has minimal use of descriptive passages and dialogue . Unlike works published by Balai Pustaka , Belenggu does not provide full exposition ; instead , it only explicitly states key points and leaves the rest for the reader to interpret , thus inviting more active participation . Siregar notes that the characters are introduced one at a time , almost as if the novel were a film ; he writes that , as a result , at times the transition between characters is unclear . 
 Unlike authors of earlier works published by Balai Pustaka , Pane does not use old Malay proverbs ; he instead uses similes . Another way in which he writes differently from earlier writers is by limiting his use of the Dutch language ; earlier writers such as Abdul Muis and Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana had used Dutch words – representative of the dominant colonial power – to illustrate the intellectualism of the main characters . Instead , in Belenggu Pane relies on the <unk> loanwords , with a glossary of difficult or uncommon words provided with early editions of the novel . Siregar wrote that Pane 's language reflected the actual use of Indonesian well . 
 = = Symbolism = = 
 According to Taum , the title Belenggu reflects the inner conflicts the main characters face that limit their actions . Taum points to the climax of the novel – in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past – as a prime example of these limitations . Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono , in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past . 
 Uncommonly for Indonesian literature during this time period , Belenggu 's chapters were labelled with only a number – other works , such as Abdul Muis ' 1928 novel Salah Asuhan ( Wrong Upbringing ) , gave both a number and subtitle to the chapters . According to Taum , this change in style represents a stream of consciousness , as opposed to the earlier style which kept chapters separate . 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = General = = = 
 Teeuw notes that , unlike most Indonesian novels at the time , Belenggu did not feature a good and pure protagonist in a struggle against an evil antagonist , or present conflict and differences between generations . It also eliminated the common themes of forced marriage and the youth 's <unk> of adat ( traditional culture ) . Instead , it showed a love triangle – common in Western literature but then unheard of in Indonesian literature – without an indication of whether any characters were good , evil , right , or wrong . Teeuw writes that the novel portrayed the interior struggle of a " new kind of human " , one who is the result of a mixture of Eastern and Western cultures . According to Christie , earlier themes in Indonesian literature such as feudalism and forced marriage are not intrinsically significant to the character 's lives in Belenggu . 
 = = = Living in the past = = = 
 A main theme found in Belenggu , reflected in the title , is if one is " shackled " to the past , then one cannot flourish ; Taum notes that this is reflected in Hartono 's dialogue to Tini , as follows : 
 " <unk> <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> zaman <unk> ? ... Jangan <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . ... <unk> , <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> . <unk> <unk> ini . <unk> apa <unk> pada zaman <unk> ? " 
 " Why not ? Why be hung up on the past ? ... Don 't blow it out of proportion , don 't complicate simple things , your thoughts will be as if they are shackled . ... Forget it , kill those reveries . Release these shackles . Why be hung up on the past ? 
 Several further instances have been expounded by critics . Taum notes that Yah 's guilt over her past as a prostitute leads her to the ( unfounded ) fear that Tono would leave her if their relationship were known ; her guilt ultimately causes their separation , while Tono feels nostalgic for the past , in which he felt happier . Balfas notes that a factor driving Tono from Tini is the latter 's former relationship with Hartono ; due to her guilt over the affair , she is unable to express her love for the doctor . Siregar writes that such a theme is reflected in dialogue between Tono and Hartono , from which he suggests the novel derives its title . Balfas writes that there is no solution to the human problems presented in the novel . 
 = = = Modernity and traditionalism = = = 
 Taum indicates that Belenggu presents modernity and traditionalism as a binary system , contrasting the new with the old . For example , Sukartono , a doctor ( a position considered a symbol of modernity ) , is obsessed with the past , including his schoolmate Rohayah , and prefers traditional kroncong music over modern genres . Through the contrast of Sukartono and his ultra @-@ modern , emancipatory wife Sumartini , Pane emphasises that modernity does not necessarily bring happiness . Aveling agrees , writing that the conflict arises over Tini 's refusal to " mother " her husband as expected from a traditional wife . According to Taum , Tono wishes for Tini to perform traditional duties , such as removing his shoes . However , Tini , refuses to do so and instead keeps herself busy with social activities . This need for a wife who behaves as he wishes ultimately becomes a factor in his falling for Yah , who does everything expected from a traditional wife . However , in the end neither modern nor traditional values alone are enough to guarantee happiness . 
 = = = Intellectuals in society = = = 
 Christie notes that Belenggu contains a strong sense of alienation . He writes that the characters seem to be part of a " society suspended in a vacuum " , without an explicit connection to colonialism but also unable to come to terms with traditional mores . Christie describes Sukartono 's relationship with Rohayah as symbolic of attempts by intellectual to engage with the masses through a shared popular culture , but ultimately failing ; Taum notes such an thing occurring in a scene where Tini plays a sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven on her violin in front of a group of regular citizens who prefer local music . Teeuw agrees , writing that the novel shows a psychological burden borne by native intellectuals who found themselves physically fit for a modern existence , but mentally unprepared for the transition from a traditional lifestyle to a more modern one . He notes that the sceptical , modern intellectual , a category in which he includes Tono and Tini , was uncommon in local literature at the time . Tham sees the underlying message of Yah 's refusal to marry Tono as that " morals and ethical standards are frequently beyond the ken of intellect , reason , or rationality " , indicating that intellectuals may not be able to collaborate effectively with the masses . Johns notes that , although the Tono and Tini are thought to be decisive persons by society , they are actually confused and unsure . 
 = = Release = = 
 Belenggu was submitted to Balai Pustaka for publication in 1938 , but was accepted because of its perceived dissonance with public morality , particularly its portrayal of adultery and prostitution – key components of the plot – as acceptable . Eventually Belenggu was picked up by Poedjangga Baroe and published in a serial format in three editions between April and June 1940 . Belenggu was the only novel published by the magazine and the first Indonesian psychological novel . In 1969 , Belenggu received the first annual Literary Prize from the government of Indonesia , along with Marah Rusli 's Sitti Nurbaya ( 1922 ) , Salah Asuhan , and Achdiat Karta Mihardja 's Atheis ( Atheist ; 1949 ) . 
 Belenggu has been translated into multiple languages : in 1962 , Mandarin as <unk> ( <unk> ) ; in 1964 , Russian as <unk> ; in 1965 , Malay under the original title ; in 1989 , English as Shackles ; and in 1993 , German as In <unk> . The Russian translation was done by A Pavlenko . The English translation , published by the Lontar Foundation , was done by John H. McGlynn . The German translation was done by Renate <unk> . As of 2008 the Indonesian @-@ language edition has seen twenty @-@ one printings . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Belenggu received a mixed reception upon its release . Proponents of the novel stated that it was daring , as it dealt with themes based on societal realities . For example , journalist S. K. Trimurti wrote that the novel clearly reflected issues faced by highly educated Indonesians in dealing with traditional culture . However , opponents of the novel dismissed it as " pornographic " , emphasising traditionally taboo acts like prostitution and adultery . The December 1940 issue of Poedjangga Baroe included comments from several other writers and literary critics , including Alisjahbana , HB Jassin , Karim Halim , and S. <unk> . Alisjahbana wrote that the novel was fatalistic and defeatist , as he felt it did not portray the freedom of spirit necessary for people to choose their own destiny ; he decried the plot as lacking causality . Jassin found the characters to resemble caricatures , as their emotions were overly melodramatic , but considered the novel representative of works yet to come . Halim wrote that Belenggu represented a new school in Indonesian literature , with new language and new stories . <unk> decried the book 's language , which he did not consider smooth , and plotlines , which he found uninteresting . According to Teeuw , the initial mixed reception was due in part to Indonesian readers – accustomed to idealised literature – being shocked by the realistic portrayals in Belenggu . 
 Later reviews have generally been more positive . In 1955 Johns wrote that Belenggu was a " great advance on any previous work " , with which the Indonesian novel came to maturity ; he praises the structure , plot , and presentation . Siregar , writing in 1964 , praised the novel 's diction , noting that Pane handled technical discussions especially well . Jassin wrote in 1967 that , although he found the characters still came across as caricatures , the novel was capable of making readers stop and think about modern conditions . In 1969 , Indonesian writer and literary critic Ajip Rosidi wrote that the novel was more interesting than earlier works because of its multi @-@ interpretable ending . The Indonesian writer and literary critic Muhammad Balfas wrote in 1976 that Belenggu was " in every respect the best novel of pre @-@ war Indonesian literature " . In his 1980 book on Indonesian literature , Teeuw wrote that despite several flaws in the psychological portrayal of the main characters , Belenggu was the only novel from before the Indonesian National Revolution in which a Western reader would feel truly involved ; he also called the novel Pane 's greatest contribution to Indonesia literature . Tham , writing in 1981 , described the novel as the best reflection of the then @-@ growing consciousness that Western values , such as individualism and intellectualism , contradicted traditional values . 
 = Trucking industry in the United States = 
 The trucking industry serves the American economy by transporting large quantities of raw materials , works in process , and finished goods over land — typically from manufacturing plants to retail distribution centers . Trucks are also used in the construction industry , as dump trucks and portable concrete mixers move the large amounts of rocks , dirt , concrete , and other building materials used in construction . Trucks in America are responsible for the majority of freight movement over land , and are tools in the manufacturing , transportation , and warehousing industries . 
 Large trucks and buses require a commercial driver 's license ( CDL ) to operate . Obtaining a CDL requires extra education and training dealing with the special knowledge requirements and handling characteristics of such a large vehicle . Drivers of commercial motor vehicles ( CMVs ) must adhere to the hours of service , which are regulations governing the driving hours of commercial drivers . These , and all other rules regarding the safety of interstate commercial driving , are issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ( FMCSA ) . The FMCSA is a division of the United States Department of Transportation ( USDOT ) , which governs all transportation @-@ related industries such as trucking , shipping , railroads , and airlines . Some other issues are handled by another branch of the USDOT , the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) . 
 Developments in technology , such as computers , satellite communication , and the Internet , have contributed to many improvements within the industry . These developments have increased the productivity of company operations , saved the time and effort of drivers , and provided new , more accessible forms of entertainment to men and women who often spend long periods of time away from home . In 2006 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented revised emission standards for diesel trucks ( reducing airborne pollutants emitted by diesel engines ) which promises to improve air quality and public health . 
 = = History = = 
 The trucking industry has affected the political and economic history of the United States in the 20th century . Before the invention of automobiles , most freight was moved by train or horse @-@ drawn vehicle . 
 Trucks were first used extensively by the military during World War I. With the increase in construction of paved roads , trucking began to achieve significant foothold in the 1930s . Public safety concerns made it necessary to implement various government regulations ( such as the 1965 hours of service rule ; recently revised with a compliance date of July 1 , 2012 ) of how long drivers were allowed to work and drive each day / week . In 1956 , Congress provided funds to build the Interstate Highway System , an extensive network of highways and freeways that linked major cities across the continent . The addition of Interstate Highway System also made it possible for the trucking industry to grow substantially in the late 1950s and early 1960s and trucking has come to dominate the freight industry in the latter portion of the 20th century . 
 Trucking achieved national attention during the 1960s and 70s , when songs and movies about truck driving were major hits . Truck drivers participated in widespread strikes against the rising cost of fuel , during the energy crises of 1973 and 1979 . Congress deregulated the trucking industry with the passage of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 . 
 = = 1990s @-@ present = = 
 Advances in modern technology have enabled significant improvements within the trucking industry . Trucks are commonly equipped with satellite communication features , automatic transmissions are gaining in popularity , and truck stops featuring WiFi Internet access are now commonplace . 
 = = = Exhaust emissions = = = 
 Components of diesel exhaust were confirmed as an animal carcinogen in 1988 by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health , and by 2002 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) considered it " likely to be carcinogenic to humans " . The particulate matter of diesel exhaust has been linked to ( among other health effects ) lung cancer , chronic bronchitis , and aggravated asthma ; it has also been identified as a greenhouse gas . " For these and other reasons , alternatives and improvements to standard diesel fuel have been developed . 
 Biodiesel ( in its pure form ) is a non @-@ toxic , biodegradable form of diesel fuel made from vegetable oil , usually soybean oil or recycled restaurant grease . Biodiesel promises a reduction in some exhaust emissions , as well as reduced dependence on foreign petroleum supplies . 
 Starting in June 2006 , petroleum refiners were required by the EPA to begin producing ultra @-@ low sulfur diesel ( <unk> ) fuel , which has 97 % less sulfur than the previous low sulfur diesel fuel . When fuel containing sulfur is burned , sulfur dioxide is produced , a main component of acid rain . <unk> , together with new air pollution control technologies required in trucks ( starting with model year 2007 ) , will reduce harmful emissions by 90 % . 
 By the time the action is fully implemented , the EPA estimates that 2 @.@ 6 million tons of smog @-@ causing nitrogen oxide emissions will be eliminated each year . <unk> or particulate matter will be reduced by an estimated 110 @,@ 000 tons a year . The reduction in sulfur will also prevent an estimated 8 @,@ 300 premature deaths , 5 @,@ 500 cases of chronic bronchitis and 17 @,@ 600 cases of acute bronchitis in children . In addition , an estimated 360 @,@ 000 asthma attacks and 386 @,@ 000 cases of respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children will also be avoided every year . 
 When not driving , truck drivers need to idle their engines to maintain climate control within the truck cab ( interior ) , as well as provide electricity for appliances . Engine idling is inefficient and only adds to the problem of air pollution . This unnecessary idling can be remedied with shore power ( which is a term and idea borrowed from the shipping industry ) , or Truck Stop Electrification . When ships are docked in a port , they connect to a land @-@ based power supply to provide electricity and eliminate the need to idle their engines . The idea of shore power was transferred to the trucking industry , and now there are companies such as IdleAire and <unk> which provide electricity to diesel trucks , which eliminates the need for the driver to idle the engine . IdleAire also provides access to the Internet , cable television , and land line phone services . IdleAire promises to eliminate one @-@ eighth of nitrogen oxide pollution through " electrified parking " , however , particulate pollution may increase in those areas where the electricity is provided by coal burning power plants . Some drivers are also experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells , which provide clean and silent power for appliances when trucks are not running . 
 = = = Fuel efficiency = = = 
 With the fuel price increases of the 2000s , the EPA and many companies have sought to increase diesel truck fuel economy . One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle , which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors ( as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes ) . Electric hybrid vehicles are another option , with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles . Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting , in which the driver shifts through the gears ( typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears ) in such a manner as to optimize the power range of the engine . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 Like many other industries , the trucking industry has benefited from the use of computers and the Internet . The Internet helps firms explore new opportunities by aggressive sales and marketing . The incremental cost of conducting business transactions on the Internet is as little as one fifteenth as expensive as paper transactions . 
 Given the limitations on truck weight and size , increased productivity in the industry comes from two sources : fewer empty miles and less time waiting between loads . U.S. Department of Transportation figures indicate that empty routes have continued to account for 29 % of single @-@ unit truck traffic ; this has been equated to an annualized 15 billion gallons of gasoline , $ 30 billion cost , or 149 million tons of excess carbon emissions . Traditional freight brokers acted as intermediaries to manage the coordination of freight , helping independent drivers or companies match loads with available empty trucks . Increasingly , computerized brokers are threatening the future of traditional human brokers by offering increased efficiency . In addition , shipper @-@ driven brokerage over the Internet enables shippers to post loads and solicit bids directly from carriers . Instead of relying upon traditional freight brokers , shippers function as their own brokers , dealing directly with freight companies . 
 Developments in satellite technology have fostered increased communication and productivity within the trucking industry . Drivers may input the information from a bill of lading into a simple text @-@ only dot matrix display screen ( commonly called a " Qualcomm " , for their ubiquitous <unk> system ) . This allows the driver to communicate with their dispatcher , who is normally responsible for determining and informing the driver of their pick @-@ up and drop @-@ off locations . Drivers are no longer required to find the nearest public phone in order to relay information regarding their load status , it can be done without leaving the truck cab . 
 The driver inputs the information , using a keyboard , into an automated system of pre @-@ formatted messages known as macros . There are macros for each stage of the loading and unloading process , such as " loaded and leaving shipper " and " arrived at final destination " . This system also allows the company to track the drivers fuel usage , speed , gear optimization , engine idle time , location , direction of travel , and amount of time spent driving . 
 Trucks equipped with GPS satellite navigation units have enabled drivers to forgo a traditional paper @-@ based map , saving time and effort . Drivers willing to pay for satellite radio or who work for a company that pays for it can listen to commercial @-@ free music , sports , news , and talk radio coast @-@ to @-@ coast without interruption of signals between cities ( as terrestrial radio signals are limited to a certain radius from the broadcasting tower ) . Digital satellite television allows smaller dish sizes , which means truck drivers are not limited to free terrestrial broadcast television , and have more options about what they watch during their off @-@ duty periods . 
 = = = Automatic transmissions = = = 
 Increasingly , companies have been equipping their trucks with automatic transmissions for a variety of reasons . Operating a manual transmission requires more skill and attention on the part of the driver , partly due to the unsynchronized transmission found in heavy @-@ duty trucks . Companies have found that switching from manual to automatic transmissions has many benefits , including increased fuel efficiency , increased driver retention , reduced wear and tear on the internal gears of transmissions ( inexperienced drivers may frequently grind the gears if proper shifting techniques are not followed ) , reduced driver fatigue , and reduced accidents ( manuals require more attention from the driver , thus increasing the chances for an accident ) . All of these factors together add up to benefit the company by reducing costs incurred from transmission repairs , accidents , and driver turnover ( a driver frustrated by a manual transmission may decide to quit his / her job ) .

 = = Economic impact = = 
 The importance of trucking is communicated by the industry adage : " If you bought it , a truck brought it . " Retail stores , hospitals , gas stations , garbage disposal , construction sites , banks , and even a clean water supply depends entirely upon trucks to distribute vital cargo . Even before a product reaches store shelves , the raw materials and other stages of production materials that go into manufacturing any given product are moved by trucks . 
 In modern times , railroads are primarily used to haul bulk quantities of cargo over long distances . Unless a manufacturing or distribution facility has a direct connection to the railroad , the remainder of the trip must be handled by truck . Recent implementation of " just in time " strategies have resulted in the increased use of trucks to help satisfy businesses ' fluid inventory needs . Using this strategy , businesses gain the ability to reduce the costs associated with excess inventory and larger warehousing facilities by requiring more frequent deliveries . According to an industry group , many retail , commercial , and government services require daily or weekly deliveries to keep supplies or merchandise on hand . Many hospitals have also moved to " just in time " inventory systems . The nation 's busiest gas stations require deliveries of fuel several times per day , while the average station receives fuel every two to three days . Grocery stores require deliveries of perishable food items every two to three days . 
 Trucks are vitally important to U.S. industry , however , measuring the impact of trucking on the economy is more difficult , because trucking services are so intertwined with all sectors of the economy . According to the measurable share of the economy that trucking represents , the industry directly contributes about 5 percent to the gross domestic product annually . In addition , the industry plays a critical support role for other transportation modes and for other sectors of the economy such as the resource , manufacturing , construction , and wholesale and retail trade industries . 
 Within the energy industry , approximately 4 percent of crude oil and petroleum products were shipped by truck in 2012 . These shipments are handled by oil and gas logistics firms , which are midstream service providers that also handle transport by pipeline , rail , and barge . Dominant companies in this space include Aux Sable , Bridger Group , DCP Midstream , Enbridge Energy Partners , Enterprise Products Partners , Genesis Energy , Gibson Energy , <unk> Midstream , Kinder Morgan Energy Partners , <unk> Partners , Sunoco Logistics , Targa Midstream Services , TransCanada , and Williams Companies . 
 Agricultural products totaling $ 118 @,@ 832 @,@ 000 , or 82 @.@ 7 percent , were shipped by truck in 2007 ( excluding animal feed , cereal grains , and forage products ) . About half of that agricultural freight was shipped by for @-@ hire trucks and half by private trucks . More than 92 percent of prepared foods , including dairy products and prepared fruit , vegetable , and nut products , were moved by truck in 2007 . 
 Within the health care industry , trucking moved $ 501 @,@ 445 @,@ 000 worth , or 65 percent of the total value , of pharmaceutical products in 2007 . 
 Lumber and other wood products totaling $ 168 @,@ 913 @,@ 000 were shipped by truck in 2007 , accounting for 91 @.@ 9 percent of this class of product . 
 Over 80 percent of all communities in the US rely exclusively on trucks to deliver all of their fuel , clothing , medicine , and other consumer goods . The trucking industry employs 10 million people ( out of a total national population of 300 million ) in jobs that relate directly to trucking . The trucking industry is the industry of small business , considering 93 percent of interstate motor carriers ( over 500 @,@ 000 ) operate 20 or fewer trucks . 
 = = Rules and regulations = = 
 A division of the U.S. Department of Transportation , the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ( FMCSA ) regulates nearly all aspects of the trucking industry . Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive , the roads and highways they may drive upon , and a lower legal definition of drunkenness . The Federal Highway Administration has established 0 @.@ 04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol . States maintain a BAC level between 0 @.@ 08 and 0 @.@ 10 percent for non @-@ CMV drivers . In some states , trucks also have special speed limits , in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes ( normally the far left lanes of multi @-@ lane highways ) . 
 = = = Commercial driver 's license = = = 
 Trucks come in many different sizes , creating the need for a truck classification system . Truck drivers are required to have a commercial driver 's license ( CDL ) to operate a CMV carrying more than 16 passengers , carrying a certain amount of hazardous materials , or weighing in excess of 26 @,@ 000 pounds ( 12 @,@ 000 kg ) . Acquiring a CDL requires a skills test ( driving test ) , and knowledge test ( written test ) covering the unique handling qualities of driving a large , heavily loaded 18 @-@ wheeler ( e.g. , backing maneuvers ) , and the mechanical systems required to operate such a vehicle ( e.g. , air brakes and vehicle inspection procedures ) . 
 = = = Hours of service = = = 
 The FMCSA defines a CMV as a single or combination ( truck and trailer ) vehicle with a gross weight of 10 @,@ 001 pounds ( 4 @,@ 536 kg ) or more , or a vehicle used to transport hazardous materials in quantities requiring the vehicle to be marked or placarded under the hazardous materials regulations . The length of time a driver may spend operating a CMV is limited by a set of rules known as the hours of service ( HOS ) . These laws are designed to protect the general motoring public by reducing accidents caused by driver fatigue . 
 The first version of the HOS were enacted in 1938 , and four revisions have been made since . The more recent revisions have relied on research into the human circadian rhythm ( the tendency for humans to follow a natural 24 @-@ hour cycle with 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep ) . As of July 1 , 2013 a driver is limited to 11 hours of actual driving within a 14 @-@ hour period , and requires a 30 @-@ minute break during the first 8 hours of on duty time . After which he / she must rest for 10 hours . The rules do not explicitly require that a driver must sleep , only that a driver must take a period of " rest " within the sleeper berth or off duty ( i.e. , at home ) . 
 Keeping track of a driver 's HOS requires the use of a log book . A truck driver 's log book is a legally defined form containing a grid outlining the 24 @-@ hour day into 15 @-@ minute increments . The driver must specify where and when he / she stopped between driving shifts , what duties were performed ( if any ) , along with the driver 's name , truck number , company info , and other information . The driver must also present his or her log book to authorities upon request , for inspection . In lieu of a log book , a motor carrier may substitute an electronic on @-@ board recorder to record the driver 's hours . 
 = = = Weight , size , and route restrictions = = = 
 The FMCSA regulates the length , width , and weight limits of CMVs for interstate commercial traffic . Interstate commercial traffic is generally limited to a network of interstate freeways , U.S. highways and state highways known as the National Network ( NN ) . Provided the truck remains on the NN , they are not subject to the state limits . State limits ( which can be lower or higher than federal limits ) come into effect for intrastate commercial traffic , provided the vehicle is not on the NN . 
 There is no federal height limit , and states may set their own limits which range from 13 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 11 m ) ( mostly on the east coast ) to 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) ( west coast ) . , As a result , the majority of trucks are somewhere between 13 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 11 m ) and 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) high . Truck drivers are responsible for checking bridge height clearances ( usually indicated by a warning sign ) before passing underneath an overpass or entering a tunnel . Not having enough vertical clearance can result in a " top out " or " bridge hit , " causing considerable traffic delays and costly repairs for the bridge or tunnel involved . 
 The federal gross weight limit for a Class 8 truck is 80 @,@ 000 pounds ( 36 @,@ 000 kg ) ( combined weight of truck , trailer , and cargo ) with axle weights limited to 12 @,@ 000 pounds ( 5 @,@ 400 kg ) ( steering axle ) and 34 @,@ 000 pounds ( 15 @,@ 000 kg ) ( tandem axles ) . Truck drivers are responsible for checking their own vehicle 's weight , usually by paying to be weighed at a truck stop scale . CMVs are subject to various state and federal laws regarding limitations on truck length ( measured from bumper to bumper ) , and truck axle length ( measured from axle to axle , or fifth wheel kingpin to axle for trailers ) . The relationship between axle weight and spacing , known as the Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula , is designed to protect bridges . Truck weights and sizes are checked by state authorities at a weigh station or port @-@ of @-@ entry .

 Truck drivers spend up to 11 hours a day driving , and up to 14 hours a day engaged in various duties ( including driving time ) such as fueling , filling out paperwork , obtaining vehicle repairs and conducting mandatory vehicle inspections .

A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long @-@ haul drivers were smokers or had quit smoking .

 In 2006 , the U.S. trucking industry employed 1 @.@ 8 million drivers of heavy trucks . A major problem for the long @-@ haul trucking industry is that a large percentage of these drivers are aging , and are expected to retire . Very few new hires are expected in the near future , resulting in a driver shortage . As of 2005 , within the long @-@ haul sector , there is an estimated shortage of 20 @,@ 000 drivers . That shortage was projected to increase to 111 @,@ 000 by 2014 , however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38 @,@ 000 . The trucking industry ( especially the long @-@ haul sector ) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours , long periods of time away from home , the dangerous nature of the work , and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor ( such as construction , which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004 ) . 
 Employee turnover within the long @-@ haul trucking industry is notorious for being extremely high . In the 4th quarter of 2005 , turnover within the largest carriers in the industry reached a record 136 percent , which means for every 100 new employees hired , 136 quit their jobs . This has resulted in a " revolving door " within most long @-@ haul trucking companies , as drivers are constantly switching jobs or quitting the industry altogether . Driver turnover within the short @-@ haul and less @-@ than @-@ truckload ( LTL ) industries is considerably less ( around 15 percent ) , mainly due to the better working conditions , higher pay , and unionized workers . One study suggests that larger companies with irregular routes , longer average lengths of hauls , and older equipment experience much higher rates of driver turnover .

 In 2009 , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) released the results of a five @-@ year @-@ long study ( the Highway Serial Killings Initiative ) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes , hitchhikers , and stranded motorists . Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database , most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops , hotels , and roadsides . The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long @-@ haul truck drivers , some of whom may be serial killers . Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims , mobility , and lack of supervision enjoyed by long @-@ haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon . The head of the initiative , Michael Harrigan , says most of the victims lead high @-@ risk lifestyles ( e.g. , prostitution ) which left them particularly vulnerable . In 2004 , the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states , which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative . 
 In response to the investigation , executive vice president of the Owner @-@ Operator Independent Drivers Association , Todd Spencer , said " Truckers are just absolutely outraged that various media sources or the FBI would draw the conclusion that truckers are over @-@ represented in the ranks of serial killers " .

 = The Baby Shower ( Seinfeld ) = 
 " The Baby Shower " is the tenth episode of the second season of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld , and the show 's 15th episode overall . In the episode , Elaine Benes ( Julia Louis @-@ Dreyfus ) throws a baby shower for her friend Leslie ( Christine Dunford ) at Jerry 's ( Jerry Seinfeld ) apartment , while he is out of town . Jerry 's friend George Costanza ( Jason Alexander ) once had a terrible date with Leslie and intends to confront her at the shower . Meanwhile , Jerry is convinced by his neighbour Kramer ( Michael Richards ) to install illegal cable television . 
 Larry Charles wrote the episode , which was directed by Tom Cherones , and was partly based on a friend of his who was pregnant but did not want to experience childbirth . The episode also contained a dream sequence in which the title character was killed , as Charles was interested in " the Quentin Tarantino version of a sitcom " . All of the characters ' storylines intersect in the final scenes , an element that the writing staff would continue to use in later episodes . The episode 's first broadcast in the United States on May 16 , 1991 gained a Nielsen rating of 12 @.@ 4 / 21 and was negatively received by critics . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Elaine holds a baby shower for her friend Leslie at Jerry 's apartment , while Jerry is performing in Buffalo . George is excited , as he expects the baby shower to be the perfect opportunity to confront the woman who gave him the worst date of his life by pouring Bosco chocolate sauce on his red collared shirt while doing performance art . Jerry is frustrated by his television 's bad reception , and is convinced by Kramer to have cable illegally installed by two Russians ( Vic Polizos and James Lashly ) . 
 As Jerry is sleeping on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer , who apparently has ratted out Jerry . When Jerry protests that he had nothing to do with it , they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent . Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents . This jolts him awake . He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather , and George picks up Jerry at the airport . Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing , even anxious to drive Jerry home . When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower , George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower . Meanwhile , Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television , start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument . When George and Jerry arrive , George 's plan proves unsuccessful , as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor . He is interrupted when one of the other party guests suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date . This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly . On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George , adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt . Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook @-@ up , but is still charged with a large amount of money . When he refuses to pay , the Russians break the picture tube of his television set . 
 = = Production = = 
 " The Baby Shower " was written by Larry Charles and directed by Tom Cherones , who directed all of season two 's episodes . The episode was the first episode written by Charles , who would remain with the show through the fifth season . Charles had met Seinfeld co @-@ creator Larry David and Richards , when he was part of the writing staff of the ABC sketch show Fridays , David and Richards were part of the show 's ensemble cast . He had been unable to write for the show 's first season , as Charles had been writing for The Arsenio Hall Show during its production . Charles frequently had difficulty with writing Jerry 's stand @-@ up material , therefore , in " The Baby Shower " , Seinfeld used some of his own material . The episode was a combination of loose storylines that had been brought to the writers table . Charles explained that the writing staff of the show considered it a challenge to weave together loose ideas into one episode . The episode was partly based on a friend of Charles , who was pregnant but did not want to experience childbirth and therefore asked the doctor to anesthetize her . Charles thought this was very ironic . The Leslie character was largely based on Karen Finley and Johanna Went , two performance artists who both used foods in their acts , Charles considered them " a ripe target for satire " . 
 As Charles was always trying to find elements that were unusual in sitcoms , the episode had a scene in which Jerry dreams he is interrogated by the FBI for his illegal cable hookup , and is killed when he tries to escape . Charles recalled the dream sequence as " one of the most ambiguous scenes we did [ in season two ] " and felt it was very Tarantino @-@ like . At the end of the dream Kramer holds Jerry in his arm , stating " what have you done to my little cable boy ? " ; this scene had to be filmed multiple times , as it was hard for Seinfeld not to laugh when Richards stated the line . In audio commentary he recorded for the Seinfeld : Volume 1 DVD set , Charles noted how he established three of the episode 's four storylines in one scene , in which the characters eat and talk at Monk 's Cafe . " The Baby Shower " also is one of the few episodes of season two in which the primary storylines of all four characters come together in the final scene . In " The Busboy " , which had been filmed earlier , the four storylines also intersected in the final scene , but the episode aired as the final episode of season two . Charles also felt the episode defined the Kramer character more , as it is the first episode in which Kramer speaks out against the system . In addition , the episode also establishes Elaine 's interest in the Kennedys , a plot element that would return later in the season four episode " The Virgin " . 
 " The Baby Shower " was first read by the show 's cast on November 14 , 1990 . It was filmed in front of a live audience on November 20 . A technique called " Poor Man 's Process " was used during the car scene with George and Jerry ; one or two crew members would shake the car to give the impression that it was moving , though it never actually was . Other crew members would move lights around the set to simulate street lights or headlights of other cars . Behind the car , two lights on a wheeled stand were placed to give the impression that there was a car behind it . A cheap plastic sticker was put on Jerry 's television screen to give the impression that it was broken . A number of scenes were changed or cut during production of the episode . In early drafts of the script , the episode opened with Kramer telling Jerry about the Russian cable installers . In the first draft of the script Elaine and Jerry would realize ahead of time that the baby shower and the cable installation would take place at the same time . This was changed as the writers felt it would be better left as a surprise . Some dialogue was removed from the scene , as Kramer initially told Jerry Benjamin Franklin would have wanted free cable . Additional dialogue between the baby shower guests regarding turning off men was also cut . The scene in which Mary <unk> , a woman Jerry went out with once but never called afterwards , makes a scene at the baby shower was not in the original script , but was added during rehearsals to give Seinfeld more involvement in the final scene . 
 Don Perry guest starred as an airplane passenger next to Jerry , when he wakes up from his nightmare . Perry states that he might be the last person Jerry will see alive . This line was not in the original script , but was added because Perry , as Charles explained , " just had the right look " . Christine Dunford was cast as Leslie , Charles commented " she just came in ; gave a great reading . At this point in our show business history , I don 't think we knew anybody " . Dunford would return later as a saleswoman in the season five episode " The Pie " . Margaret Reed , best known for her role on the soap opera As the World Turns , appeared as Mary <unk> , a woman who screams at Jerry for not calling her back after a date . Vic Polizos and James Lashly guest @-@ starred as the Russian cable installers . Norman Brenner , who worked as Richards ' stand @-@ in on the show for all its nine seasons , appears as an extra in the first scene of the episode , standing at the counter at Monk 's Cafe .

 = Cynthia Lennon = 
 Cynthia Lennon ( née Powell ; 10 September 1939 – 1 April 2015 ) was the first wife of English musician John Lennon , and mother of Julian Lennon . She grew up in the middle @-@ class section of Hoylake , on the Wirral Peninsula in North West England . At the age of 12 , she was accepted into the Junior Art School , and was later enrolled in the Liverpool College of Art . John Lennon also attended the college ; a meeting with Powell in a calligraphy class led to their relationship . 
 When John was performing in Hamburg with the Beatles , she rented his bedroom from his aunt and legal guardian , Mimi Smith . After Powell became pregnant , she and John were married on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant register office in Liverpool and from 1964 to 1968 , they lived at Kenwood in the Surrey town of Weybridge , where she kept house and participated with her husband in a London @-@ based social life . In 1968 , John left her for Japanese avant @-@ garde conceptual artist Yoko Ono and as a result , the couple 's divorce was legally granted on 8 November 1968 on the grounds of John 's adultery with Ono . 
 She married Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini in 1970 , divorcing him in 1973 . In 1976 , she married John Twist , an engineer from Lancashire , but divorced him in 1983 . After her divorce from Twist , she changed her name back to " Lennon " by deed poll and met Jim Christie , her partner for 17 years . She was later married to Noel Charles , a night club owner , from 2002 until his death in 2013 . She published a book of memoirs , A Twist of Lennon , in 1978 , and a more intimate biography , John , in 2005 . Over the years she staged several auctions of memorabilia associated with her life with John Lennon . In 2006 , she and her son Julian Lennon attended the Las Vegas premiere of the Cirque du Soleil production of Love whose theme is the music of the Beatles . Until her death in 2015 , she lived in Majorca , Spain . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Cynthia Powell was born on 10 September 1939 in Blackpool , Lancashire , England , the youngest of three children of Charles Powell and his wife Lillian ( née Roby ) , who already had two sons a number of years older , Charles and Anthony . Charles Powell worked for the GEC company . The Powells had lived in Liverpool , but along with other pregnant women , Lillian Powell was sent to the safer Blackpool after World War II had been declared , and lived in a small room in a bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast on the Blackpool seafront . After the birth , with Liverpool becoming a frequent target of German air raids , the Powell family moved to a two @-@ bedroomed semi @-@ detached house in Hoylake . This was a middle @-@ class area on the Wirral Peninsula , considered " posh " by those in Liverpool . 
 At the age of 11 , she won an art prize in a competition organised by the Liverpool Echo . One year later she was accepted into Liverpool 's Junior Art School , which was also attended by Bill Harry , later editor of Liverpool 's Mersey Beat newspaper . 
 = = Art college = = 
 When Powell was 17 , her father died after a long battle with lung cancer . Before he died , he told her she would have to get a job to support her mother , and would not be able to go to art school . As her mother wanted her to receive an education , she rented out a room to four apprentice electricians . In September 1957 , Powell gained a place at the Liverpool College of Art . Although studying graphics , she also took lettering classes , as did Lennon . He never had any drawing tools with him , so he constantly borrowed pens and pencils from Powell , who discovered he was only there because other teachers had refused to instruct him . She had an air of respectability and moved in different social circles than her future husband . Lennon and an art school friend , Geoff Mohammed , used to make fun of her by stopping the conversation when she walked in the room , saying : " Quiet please ! No dirty jokes ; it 's Cynthia . " 
 Powell once overheard Lennon give a compliment to a girl with blonde hair in the college , who looked similar to the French actress Brigitte Bardot . The next Saturday , Powell turned up at the college with her hair several shades blonder . Lennon noticed straight away , exclaiming , " Get you , Miss Hoylake ! " ( Lennon 's nickname for her , along with " Miss Powell " or " Miss Prim " ) . Dressed like a Teddy Boy , he sometimes brought a guitar with him into class , and once sang " Ain 't She Sweet " directly to Powell . 
 = = = Relationship with John Lennon = = = 
 After a college party to celebrate the end of term , Lennon asked Powell if she would like to " go out " with him . She quickly replied that she was engaged to a young man in Hoylake , he replied , " I didn 't ask you to marry me , did I ? " He later approached her and asked if she would go to the Ye <unk> pub . She was confused when he ignored her all evening , but eventually invited her into the group with a joke . 
 They began dating , with Lennon now referring to her as " Cyn " . In the autumn of 1958 , she ended her engagement to be with him , and he ended his relationship with another art student , Thelma Pickles . His jealousy could also manifest itself in violent behaviour towards her , as when he slapped her across the face ( causing her head to hit a wall ) , after watching her dance with Stuart Sutcliffe . After the incident , she broke up with Lennon for three months , but resumed their relationship after his profuse apology . Another time a cleaning woman at the college caught Lennon hitting her and suggested she stay away from him . 
 Her work at art school began to suffer , and teachers told her the relationship with Lennon was doing her no good . Lennon continued to be casually inconsiderate towards her , later saying , " I was in sort of a blind rage for two years . I was either drunk or fighting . It had been the same with other girl friends I 'd had . There was something the matter with me . " Tony Bramwell — a friend of Lennon 's since his youth — later said : " Cynthia was beautiful , physically , and on the inside . Although she knew he [ Lennon ] was apt to find love on the road , she was totally dedicated to his success ... and extremely influential . He was insecure and Cynthia was there to pump him up , to buttress , sort of , his weak side . " 
 The Beatles ' first Hamburg residency took place in 1960 , with Lennon writing frequent and passionate letters back home to Powell . After returning home , Lennon 's aunt and legal guardian , Mimi Smith , threw a hand @-@ mirror at him for spending a lot of money on a suede coat for Powell . Smith later referred to her as " a gangster 's moll " , and was often unpleasant towards her . The Beatles went to Hamburg for a second time in 1961 , and both Powell and Dot Rhone ( Paul McCartney 's girlfriend at the time ) , visited them two weeks later , during the Easter holidays . They had to stay up all night because of the long sets , with both taking Preludin to stay awake , which the group were also taking . Lennon and Powell stayed with Sutcliffe 's girlfriend , Astrid Kirchherr , at her mother 's house . After the trip to Hamburg , Powell 's mother Lillian said Powell 's cousin and husband were emigrating to Canada with their new @-@ born baby , and that she , Lillian , would be going with them while they studied to become teachers . Powell waited until Lennon came back from Hamburg before she asked Smith — who had taken in lodgers before at 251 Menlove Avenue — if she would rent a room to her . Smith rented out the box @-@ room above the front door ( which had been Lennon 's bedroom ) , but insisted she also do chores around the house . To pay the rent , she took a job at a Woolworths store in Liverpool , after her student grant had run out . In the same year , when Lennon was 21 years old , he received £ 100 from his aunt Mater who lived in Edinburgh , and went to Paris with McCartney . Powell could not accompany them as she was studying for her final exams . 
 When Lennon went to Hamburg again in April 1962 , she found a bedsit in a terraced house at 93 <unk> Road , Liverpool . Shortly after having failed her art teacher 's diploma exam , in August 1962 , she found she was pregnant with Lennon 's child . She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception , had never talked about it , and didn 't think about it at the time . When she told Lennon he said , " There 's only one thing for it Cyn , we 'll have to get married " . 
 = = Marriage and Julian = = 
 The Lennons were married on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool . Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance , as was their manager , Brian Epstein , who was best man ; no parents were there . The wedding was farcical , because as soon as the ceremony began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a pneumatic drill which drowned out anything the registrar , Lennon , or Powell said . When the registrar asked for the groom to step forward , Harrison stepped forward instead . With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards , at Epstein 's invitation , in Reece 's restaurant in Clayton Square , which was the same restaurant where Lennon 's parents , Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon , had celebrated their marriage in 1938 . Lennon was 21 years old , and Powell 22 . The newlyweds had no honeymoon , as Lennon had to play an engagement at the <unk> Ballroom in Chester the same night , although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris , for a belated honeymoon on 16 September , but were accompanied by Epstein , even though he had not been invited to join them . 
 During her pregnancy , Epstein offered the couple the use of his flat at 36 Falkner Street , and later paid for a private hospital room when the pregnancy was coming to term . Although still completely unknown outside Liverpool , by now the Beatles had a fanatical following among girls within the city . Epstein had one condition which the Lennons had to follow : the marriage and the baby were to be kept a close secret , so as not to upset any of these fans . One time when news of the wedding leaked out , the group denied it . Cynthia was happy to keep a low profile , not wanting to be the subject of public attention the way her husband was . 
 The Lennons ' son , John Charles Julian Lennon , was born at 7 @.@ 45 am on 8 April 1963 , in Sefton Hospital . Lennon , being on tour at the time , did not see his son until three days later , and when he finally arrived at the hospital , said : " He 's bloody marvellous , Cyn ! ... Who 's gonna be a famous rocker like his Dad then ? " He then explained that he would be going on a four @-@ day holiday to Barcelona , with Epstein . Lennon later referred to Julian as a " Saturday night special ; the way that most people get here " , or said that his son " came out of a whisky bottle " . 
 = = Beatlemania = = 
 Around the time of Julian 's birth , the Beatles became a pop sensation across Britain , a phenomenon which became known as Beatlemania . That one of the members was married and had a son was not publicly known at the time ; a 1963 " Lifelines of the Beatles " page in the New Musical Express detailed over 25 biographical facts about each member of the group , but never gave any hint Lennon was married , even reporting " girls " as one of his hobbies . The press heard rumours about Lennon 's wife and child at the end of 1963 — after Beatlemania had already swept the UK and Europe — and descended on her mother 's house in Hoylake ( where mother and son were staying ) , in November and December . Friends and neighbours protected their anonymity , but she was often approached by journalists . In November she had her son christened at the Hoylake parish church , but didn 't tell Lennon ( who was on tour at the time ) , because she feared a media circus . She told him two days after , and he was angry as he hadn 't wanted his son to be christened , even though Epstein had asked to be Julian 's godfather . Not long after the christening , every newspaper was full of the story about Lennon 's secret wife and baby boy . Epstein told the other Beatles to make the best of the situation , and hoped newspapers would not say Cynthia was pregnant before marrying him . After living at Lennon 's aunt 's house for some months , the couple moved to London and found a three @-@ bedroomed flat at 13 Emperor 's Gate , off Cromwell Road . The top floor flat was the third of three , which were each built over two floors . This meant climbing six flights of stairs , as the building had no lift . Cynthia firstly had to carry Julian up to the flat , and then go back down to collect shopping bags . The Beatles ' fans soon found out where they were living , and she would find them camping out in the hallway , and have to push through them when leaving or arriving . 
 She accompanied Lennon to America on the first Beatles ' tour there , with Lennon allowing the press to photograph them together , which infuriated Epstein , as he had wanted to keep their marriage a secret . On the tour , she was left behind in New York when Lennon and the other Beatles were quickly ushered into a car , and in Miami she had to ask the help of fans to convince a security guard who she was . Lennon 's response was , " Don 't be so bloody slow next time — they could have killed you " . It would be the only time Cynthia would go on tour with them . At the Emperor 's Gate address the situation grew worse , with fans sticking chewing gum in the lock of the flat and tearing at any article of clothing when she or Lennon were leaving or arriving . American girls would write her letters proclaiming their desperate love for John ; the women in the lives of the other Beatles received equivalent missives . As late as 1967 , Beatles ' wives were still dealing with occasional physical danger from female Beatles ' fans , with Cynthia being kicked in the legs by one who demanded she " leave John alone ! " 
 As Lennon was either touring or recording , supposed family holidays in 1966 were skiing in St. Moritz , with producer George Martin and his girlfriend , or staying at a castle in Ireland , with George Harrison and Pattie Boyd ( Harrison 's wife ) . Even these were subject to being discovered by fans , with Cynthia and Pattie having to escape the Irish location by being dressed as maids . As a result of the long recording sessions and tours , Lennon usually slept for days afterwards . When Lennon started filming How I Won the War in Almeria , Spain , he promised his wife and son they could join him there after two weeks of filming . The small apartment they were allocated was swiftly replaced by a villa when Starr and his wife joined them . 
 = = Kenwood = = 
 = = = Domestic life = = = 
 The Beatles ' accountant told Epstein the group members should move to houses near his in Esher , so Lennon bought a house called Kenwood in July 1964 . It was a mock @-@ Tudor @-@ style house on three acres in Weybridge , where Cliff Richard already lived . Lennon then spent twice the original £ 20 @,@ 000 purchase price on renovations for Kenwood , reducing its 22 rooms to 17 . The new kitchen was so modern and complicated , someone had to be sent to explain how everything worked , and during the extensive renovations the couple had to live in the attic bedroom for nine months . Although Cynthia enjoyed entertaining in the larger rooms , Lennon could usually be found in a small sunroom at the back of the house overlooking the swimming pool , which was similar to his aunt 's conservatory in Liverpool . They had a cat called " Mimi " , named after Lennon 's aunt . Cynthia took care of Julian herself , without a nanny , although babysitters were frequently employed . She also did the cooking herself , but employed a housekeeper , gardener , and chauffeur , who lived off the premises . 
 When she passed her driving test , Lennon serially bought her a white Mini , a gold Porsche , a red Ferrari , and a green Volkswagen Beetle , usually as surprises without consulting her first . Cynthia enjoyed the closeness of Pattie Boyd ( George Harrison 's wife ) and Maureen Starkey ( Ringo Starr 's wife ) , as both lived nearby , often going on holiday together or shopping . She was often photographed at Beatles ' movie premieres and special occasions , and sometimes with Lennon and Julian at home , which meant she had the role of a Beatle wife , as well as being a mother . The Lennons often went to a nightclub in central London until nearly dawn , after which she took Julian to school . Kenwood became the place to visit for the other Beatles , various American musicians , and total strangers who Lennon had met the previous night in London nightclubs . 
 In 1965 , she opened the front door of Kenwood to see a man who " looked like a tramp " , but with her husband 's features . He explained that he was Alfred Lennon , the father whom Lennon had supposedly not seen for years . Lennon was annoyed when he came home , telling her for the first time that his father had visited the NEMS office , Epstein 's business , a few weeks before . Three years after the meeting in the NEMS office , Alfred Lennon ( who was then 56 years old ) turned up at Kenwood again with his fiancée , 19 @-@ year @-@ old student Pauline Jones . He asked if the Lennons could give Pauline a job , so she was hired to help with Julian and the piles of Beatles ' fan mail . Lennon 's father and his fiancée then spent a few months living in the attic bedroom . During an interview at Kenwood with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave , Lennon said , " Here I am in my Hansel and Gretel house , famous and loaded , and I can 't go anywhere . There 's something else I 'm going to do , only I don 't know what it is , but I do know this isn 't it for me " . 
 = = = Drugs = = = 
 Cynthia knew her husband took drugs like Preludin , and regularly smoked cannabis but thought of them as not being very dangerous , especially the cannabis . On 27 March 1965 , at a dinner party given by a dentist , John Riley , the Lennons , Harrison , and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge . Although told not to leave the house , Harrison drove them to various nightclubs , with Riley following them by taxi . At the Ad Lib club , they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming , before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger , Marianne Faithfull , and Starr were waiting . Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd 's Mini Cooper at no more than 10 mph , as he was also feeling the effects of the drug . They stayed up all night at Kenwood , experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip . 
 Lennon then started taking LSD on a regular basis , as well as his daily use of cannabis . After much encouragement from him , Cynthia agreed to try LSD one more time , but the adverse effects were the same . Although she said at the time she would never take the drug again , she relented and took it for the last time a few weeks later , on the way to a party at Epstein 's country house in <unk> , East Sussex . Although she hated the psychological effects of the drug , from this point she could see the change taking place in her husband : " It was like living with someone who had just discovered religion ... Tensions , bigotry , and bad temper were replaced by understanding and love " . In 1970 , Lennon confessed he had probably taken LSD one thousand times since 1965 , saying : " I used to just eat it all the time " . In the decades ahead , Cynthia would always maintain that John 's drug use was the beginning of the end for the couple . 
 On 22 July 1967 , Harrison , Boyd , Starr , and assistant Neil Aspinall flew to Athens , where they stayed overnight until Lennon , his wife and son , McCartney , and Jane Asher ( McCartney 's girlfriend ) , Boyd 's 16 @-@ year @-@ old sister , Paula , roadie Mal Evans , and publicist Alistair Taylor set off for Athens . Looking for an island they could buy to live on together , they chartered a yacht , the MV Arvi . McCartney later said that whilst sailing around Greek islands , everybody just " sat around and took LSD " . Lennon and the other Beatles publicly renounced drugs — although never completely — after their initial meetings with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London , and Bangor , Wales . 
 By 1967 , Lennon 's aggressive edges from his childhood had disappeared , and he spent considerable amounts of time sitting in his sunroom or garden and daydreaming for hours at end . He became somewhat uncommunicative towards most people , including Cynthia ( but not with the other Beatles , who had an almost unspoken ability to understand one another ) . Cynthia once complained , saying : " What I 'd like is a holiday of our own ... John , Julian and me " . Lennon replied with , " OK , I know , we 'll all retire to a little cottage on a cliff in Cornwall , all right ? " Then adding , " No , I 've got these bloody songs to write . I have to work , to justify living . " She understood his temperament , but felt frustrated at never having developed her own career by using her art college background . 
 = = = India and Ono = = = 
 The Beatles were scheduled to fly to India to visit the Maharishi for two or three months of Transcendental Meditation . Before they left , Cynthia found letters from Yoko Ono to Lennon which indicated he had had contact with her over a period of some time . Lennon denied he was involved with Ono , explaining that she was just some " crazy artist " who wanted to be sponsored , although Ono kept up a stream of telephone calls and visits to Kenwood . On 15 February 1968 , the Lennons flew to India , followed by the other Beatles and their partners four days later : Boyd , Asher , and Maureen Starkey ( Starr 's wife ) . The division between the sexes was emphasised by the male musicians sitting outside at night composing songs , while their partners gathered together in one of their rooms , often talking about life as the wife or partner of a Beatle . The Lennons shared a four @-@ poster bed at the ashram , with Lennon playing guitar and Cynthia drawing and writing poetry between their long sessions of meditation . 
 " Magic Alex " ( Greek @-@ born Alex Mardas , who controlled Apple Electronics ) arrived later , smuggling in alcohol from the nearest village as it was not allowed in the ashram . After two weeks Lennon asked to sleep in a separate room , saying he could only meditate when he was alone , but walked down to the local post office every morning to see if he had received a telegram from Ono , who sent one almost daily . Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later , saying : " I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making of our marriage – but in reality it just presaged the end " . Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs , The Beatles in Rishikesh , showing Lennon deep in thought , and Cynthia 's confused expression . Despite the alienation from Lennon , she later spoke about her time there , saying : " I loved being away from the fans , hordes of people , deadlines , demands and flashing cameras " .

 During the flight back to England , Lennon got very drunk on Scotch and confessed that he had been involved with other women during their marriage . He went on to detail his liaisons with groupies , friends ( such as Joan Baez , actress Eleanor Bron , journalist Cleave ) and " thousands " of women around the globe . Although not wanting to hear Lennon 's confession , she knew women were attracted to him , " like moths to a flame " . Two weeks later , in May 1968 , Lennon suggested Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas , Donovan , and two friends , as he would be very busy recording songs for what would become The White Album . She arrived back at Kenwood from Greece earlier than expected , at four o 'clock on 22 May 1968 , to discover Lennon and Ono sitting cross @-@ legged on the floor in matching white robes , staring into each other 's eyes , and then found Ono 's slippers outside the Lennons ' bedroom door . Shocked , she asked Jenny Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment . At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed , but she and Mardas drank more alcohol , with Mardas trying to convince her to run away together . After she had vomited in the bathroom , she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom , with Mardas joining her and trying to kiss her until she pushed him away . 
 Lennon seemed absolutely normal when she returned home the next day , and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son , saying : " It 's you I love Cyn ... I love you now more than ever before " . Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after , but as she was specifically not invited , a trip to <unk> , in Italy , was arranged with her mother . After an evening with Italian hotelier , Roberto Bassanini , Mardas was waiting at the hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery , seek sole custody of Julian , and " send her back to Hoylake " . She said in 2005 : " The mere fact that ‘ Magic Alex ’ [ Mardas ] arrived in Italy in the middle of the night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious . I was being coerced into making it easy " ... [ for Lennon and Ono ] " to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad . " As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings , it prompted her to exclaim : " <unk> me for divorce ? On what grounds is he suing me ? " When the news of Ono 's pregnancy broke , Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968 . The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon 's refusing to offer any more than £ 75 @,@ 000 , telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more . The settlement was then raised to £ 100 @,@ 000 , £ 2 @,@ 400 annually , and custody of Julian . Another £ 100 @,@ 000 was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21 . Until that time , his mother would receive the interest payments . Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968 . The trust fund had one codicil , which provided for any further children by Lennon , so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975 , Julian 's inheritance was cut to £ 50 @,@ 000 . 
 She lived for a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square , central London , but returned to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead , rather than in isolated Weybridge . Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood ( with Ono alongside Lennon ) , with Lennon accusing her of having an affair in India , saying she was no " innocent little flower " . McCartney visited her and Julian that year , and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became " Hey Jude " . Talking about their divorce , McCartney later said : " We 'd been very good friends for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non <unk> and out of my life " . Cynthia recalled , " I was truly surprised when , one afternoon , Paul arrived on his own . I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed ' Hey Jude ' in the car . I will never forget Paul 's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us . " She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together , and answered : " It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody . Macho Northern men didn 't do that in those days " . In contrast , Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song " Norwegian Wood ( This Bird Has Flown ) " about an affair he was having , but rendered it in " gobbledegook " so Cynthia would not know . 
 = = Subsequent life = = 
 On 31 July 1970 , Cynthia married Bassanini , whom she had started dating after parting with Lennon ; the couple divorced in 1973 . She then opened a restaurant in Ruthin , Wales , called Oliver 's Bistro , which also had a B & B above the premises . She enrolled her son into the Ruthin School and he later joined the local Combined Cadet Force . During Lennon 's separation from Ono in 1973 / 74 , his partner at the time , May Pang , actively tried to get Lennon to spend more time with his son , forming a friendship with Lennon 's ex @-@ wife in the process , which continued even after Lennon and Ono were reconciled . A meeting during this period was the last time Cynthia saw John . Previously , Julian had been allowed to visit his father twice a year by himself , but Lennon complained that during his time with Pang his ex @-@ wife also wanted to be present , saying : " She [ Cynthia ] thought she could walk back in ' cos I wasn 't with Yoko ! " After his reconciliation with Ono , he complained again that his son was not being allowed to visit him . 
 On 1 May 1976 , Cynthia married John Twist , an engineer from Lancashire . She published a memoir during their time together , A Twist of Lennon , in 1978 , telling about her life before and with Lennon , and containing her own illustrations and poetry . Lennon tried to stop the publication of the book after an excerpt was published in a newspaper . 
 On 9 December 1980 ( UK time ) , whilst staying at Starr 's ex @-@ wife 's home , she received a phone call from Starr , two hours after Lennon had been shot in New York . " The memory of Ringo 's words , the sound of his tearful voice crackling over the transatlantic line , is crystal clear : ' Cynthia , I 'm so sorry , John 's dead ' . I had only one clear thought . My son , our son , [ Julian ] was at home in bed , I had to get back to Ruthin so that I could tell him about his father 's death . " 
 Cynthia 's memoir gained renewed interest and went to a third printing of 200 @,@ 000 copies in the weeks after Lennon 's death . She and Twist separated in 1981 and were divorced in 1983 . She sold the Bistro and changed her name back to Lennon by deed poll , later commenting about why it was financially necessary : " Do you imagine I would have been awarded a three @-@ year contract to design bedding and textiles [ for <unk> <unk> in 1983 ] with the name Powell ? Neither did they . When it is necessary to earn a living , it is necessary to bite the bullet and take the flack . " 
 She began a relationship with Liverpudlian chauffeur Jim Christie in 1981 , who became her partner for 17 years as well as her business manager , living in Penrith , Cumbria . She said at the time : " Jim has never felt he 's living in John Lennon 's shadow . He 's four years younger than me and wasn 't really part of that whole Beatles ' scene . " They later lived on the Isle of Man and then Normandy for some years , but separated in 1998 . 
 She had kept mementos of Lennon for years , but began auctioning them off after his death , including a personally drawn Christmas card from Lennon to her , which fetched £ 8 @,@ 800 at Christie 's in August 1981 . With her finances in an unsteady state – would say in 1999 that " Apart from John , the men I have fallen in love with have never been good at earning a living " – more of her memorabilia of Lennon went up for auction in 1991 , including antiques from Kenwood . She said at the time , " I 've enjoyed these things for 30 years . But it 's time for a change . " Another set of items , including some of Lennon 's drug paraphernalia , brought over $ 60 @,@ 000 for her in 1995 . She later said , " I think in life we collect so much baggage , when you have a clearout , you send it to a car @-@ boot sale , etc . My baggage was in demand and sold at Christie 's . When you have to pay the bills , you 're not proud and you can 't take it with you . " 
 Over the years she entered some failed business ventures , including in 1988 a perfume named Woman ( after the 1980 John Lennon song ) and , in April 1989 , a restaurant named Lennon 's — at 13 / 14 Upper St. Martin 's Lane , Covent Garden — which had menu items such as Rubber Sole ( a play on the already @-@ punning 1965 Beatles album ) , as well as Sgt. Pepper 's Steak and Penny Lane <unk> . It had a short life as a business venture , as it was considered to be far too expensive . She would later blame some of these efforts on the men in her life encouraging her . 
 The Beatles ' Hamburg days were the subject of the 1994 film Backbeat , with Jennifer Ehle portraying Cynthia Powell . The film characterises Lennon and Cynthia 's relationship as one that will eventually be doomed by their wanting different things from life , but with Lennon not wanting to hurt her . Cynthia later complained that the film made her out " as a clingy , dim , little girlfriend in a headscarf " . She was portrayed in 2000 television film In His Life : The John Lennon Story by Gillian Kearney ; the negative aspects of John 's treatment towards her were not overlooked . Cynthia was subsequently portrayed in the troubled , Ono @-@ centric 2005 American musical Lennon , with her character – played by Julia Murney – gaining a little more prominence during one of the show 's rewrites . Her life had a more central role in the 2010 BBC Four film Lennon Naked , with Claudie <unk> playing the part . However , her character was absent from the 2009 British film Nowhere Boy , which purported to cover the story of Lennon from 1955 to 1960 but focused on his relationships with his aunt and mother . 
 In 1995 , Cynthia made her recording début with a rendition of " Those Were the Days " , which as produced by McCartney had been a number one hit for Mary Hopkin in 1968 . It failed to chart . Whilst living in Normandy , an exhibition of her drawings and paintings were displayed at Portobello Road 's <unk> Gallery in 1999 . By the 1990s she was appearing at some Beatles conventions , but appeared ambivalent about the practice . At times she maintained she was moving on with her life and putting her Beatles past behind her and at other times seemed to embrace continued interest in that past as inevitable . The Daily Telegraph said in a 1999 profile , " In essence , she is a suburban woman who – almost in spite of herself – got caught up with one of the most extraordinary men of modern times . More than 30 years since her marriage to John Lennon ended , she is as entangled as ever . " 
 = = Later years and death = = 
 In 2002 , she married Noel Charles , a Barbadian night club owner . In September 2005 , she published a new biography , John , re @-@ examining her life with Lennon and the years afterwards , including the events following his death . Michel Faber , writing in The Guardian , said of the book : " John is Cynthia 's attempt to prove how much more she was worth . In theory , the disclosures of Lennon 's loyal partner from 1958 to 1968 cannot fail to be valuable . On the page , the potential withers " . In 2006 , she and her son attended the Las Vegas premiere of the Cirque du Soleil production of Love , which marked a rare public appearance with Ono . In 2009 , she and her son opened an exhibition of memorabilia at The Beatles Story exhibition in Liverpool , and she and Pattie Boyd staged a first @-@ ever joint appearance at the opening of the <unk> Center for the Arts in Yerevan , Armenia . On 30 September 2010 , Julian opened his " Timeless " exhibition of photographs at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in New York . In attendance were Cynthia , Julian , Ono , Sean , and Pang , which was the first time all five had been in the same room together . 
 The John Lennon Peace Monument was unveiled by Cynthia and Julian at a ceremony in Chavasse Park , Liverpool , on 9 October 2010 to celebrate what would have been Lennon ’ s 70th birthday . Cynthia lived with her husband , Noel , on the island of Majorca in Spain until his death on 11 March 2013 . 
 She died on 1 April 2015 at her home in Majorca , Spain , at the age of 75 after a short struggle with cancer , with her son Julian Lennon by her side . Public messages of condolence were made by McCartney and Starr , with the former saying " She was a lovely lady who I 've known since our early days together in Liverpool . She was a good mother to Julian and will be missed by us all ... " and the latter " Peace and love to Julian Lennon God bless Cynthia " . Ono also issued a statement , emphasizing the position she held in common : " Being a single parent of a strong and intelligent boy is never easy . Cynthia and I understood each other in that way , wishing well for our sons and their future . " Beatles biographer Hunter Davies , who had spent considerable time with her and John in the 1960s while researching his book , remembered her as " a lovely woman ... She was totally different from John in that she was quiet , reserved and calm . " 
 = Maryland Terrapins football = 
 The Maryland Terrapins football team represents the University of Maryland , College Park in the sport of American football . The Terrapins compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) and the Big Ten Conference . The Terrapins joined the Big Ten Conference on July 1 , 2014 , following 62 years in the Atlantic Coast Conference as a founding member . The Terrapins are currently coached by D.J. Durkin . Since 1950 , the Terrapins have played their home games at Maryland Stadium in College Park , Maryland with occasional home games from time to time in Baltimore , Maryland , making them one of two FBS football teams in the Baltimore – Washington metropolitan area ( Navy Midshipmen ) and the closest Football Bowl Subdivision team to Washington , DC . The team 's official colors of red , white , black , and gold have been in use in some combination since the 1920s and are taken from Maryland 's state flag , and the Terrapins nickname — often abbreviated as " Terps " — was adopted in 1933 after a turtle species native to the state . Maryland shares storied rivalries with Virginia and West Virginia . 
 The program 's achievements have included one NCAA @-@ recognized national championship , nine ACC championships , two Southern Conference championships , eleven consensus All @-@ Americans , several Hall of Fame inductees , and twenty @-@ four bowl game appearances . Maryland possesses the third @-@ most ACC championships with nine , which places them behind Clemson and Florida State with 15 each . Many former Terrapins players and coaches have gone on to careers in professional football including 16 first @-@ round NFL Draft picks .

 In 1892 , the school then known as the Maryland Agricultural College fielded its first officially sanctioned college football team . They went scoreless in all three of that season 's games , but the following year , posted a perfect record of 6 – 0 . For the first two decades of the program , the team primarily competed against local universities and high schools due to the prohibitive nature of long @-@ distance travel at the time . 
 In 1911 , Harry C. " Curley " Byrd became head coach and held that position for more than two decades until he was named the university president . In 1921 , Maryland joined the Southern Conference where it remained for thirty years . Between 1935 and 1946 , the school had several coaches that achieved fame elsewhere : Frank Dobson , a former assistant coach under John Heisman ; Clark Shaughnessy , architect of Stanford 's undefeated 1940 turnaround ; and Paul " Bear " Bryant , who later became the long @-@ time Alabama head coach . Bryant resigned after one season when a player he had suspended was reinstated by President Byrd . 
 = = = Jim Tatum ( 1947 – 1955 ) = = = 
 Jim Tatum was hired in 1947 , after a brief stint at Oklahoma where he had led the Sooners to a conference championship in his only season there . He was Maryland 's sixth head coach in eight years , but Tatum stayed for nine seasons and became the school 's most successful head coach in modern history . During his tenure , he led Maryland to two national championships ( one retroactive ) , three conference championships , three perfect seasons , six top @-@ 20 final rankings , and five bowl game appearances . Seven of his players were named first @-@ team All @-@ Americans , including five consensus All @-@ Americans . Under Tatum , Maryland finished every season with a winning record . 
 After the 1947 season , the Terrapins participated in their first bowl game , the 1948 Gator Bowl , in which they tied Georgia , 20 – 20 . NCAA season @-@ scoring leader Lu Gambino recorded all three Maryland touchdowns . In 1949 , Maryland again played in the Gator Bowl , where they defeated 20th @-@ ranked Missouri , 20 – 7 . The Terrapins finished the season ranked 14th by the Associated Press . Maryland 's current home field , Maryland Stadium , was constructed in 1950 , and named in honor of former coach and contemporary Maryland president Curly Byrd . Maryland started the 1950 season ranked 15th and defeated Navy , 35 – 21 , in the Byrd Stadium dedication game . 
 The Terrapins won the 1951 Southern Conference co @-@ championship alongside the Virginia Military Institute . Their perfect season culminated with an upset over first @-@ ranked Tennessee in the 1952 Sugar Bowl . At the time , however , the wire services released their final rankings before the bowl games , and Maryland finished third in the Associated Press Poll . Several selectors , including analyst Jeff Sagarin , have retroactively credited Maryland with the national championship . In 1953 , Maryland and six other schools split from the Southern Conference to form the Atlantic Coast Conference . That year , Maryland shut @-@ out two 11th @-@ ranked teams : Mississippi , 38 – 0 , and Alabama , 21 – 0 , won the ACC co @-@ championship alongside Duke , and were named the national champions as the only undefeated and untied team in the nation . The Terrapins were defeated by fourth @-@ ranked Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl . After the 1955 season , Tatum resigned to return to North Carolina , where he soon died of Rocky Mountain spotted fever . 
 = = = Tommy Mont ( 1956 – 1958 ) = = = 
 After Tatum resigned to coach at his own alma mater , North Carolina , Tommy Mont was appointed as his replacement . In his first season , Maryland was riddled with injuries and posted a disappointing 2 – 7 – 1 record . Mont had great difficulty recruiting to the same standard that his predecessor had , but managed to secure Rod Breedlove , a highly touted guard prospect . Breedlove later went on to play eight years in the NFL and made a Pro Bowl appearance . 
 In 1957 , the Terrapins improved to a 5 – 5 record . The highlight of the season was a game featuring Jim Tatum 's return to College Park , Maryland . On October 19 , at Byrd Stadium , Maryland met the North Carolina team led by their former head coach . The game also had in attendance Queen Elizabeth II who had expressed a wish to see her first game of American football . The Tar Heels were ranked 6th in the nation and possessed a 3 – 1 record . The Terrapins , on the other hand , were 1 – 3 . In the first quarter , Maryland halfback Howard Dare fumbled and North Carolina linebacker Jack Lineberger recovered the ball on the Terrapins ' 44 @-@ yard line . North Carolina was subsequently forced to punt , but recovered it at the Maryland 35 . On the ensuing possession , Tar Heel halfback Daley Goff rushed 11 yards for a touchdown . In the third quarter , Maryland gained excellent field position when Goff received a bad punt snap and the Terps took over on the Carolina 38 @-@ yard line . Maryland quarterback Bob <unk> later scored on a one @-@ yard sneak . In the fourth quarter , halfback Ted Kershner broke away for an 81 @-@ yard touchdown run . Fullback Jim Joyce capped a 67 @-@ yard drive with a 13 @-@ yard rush for a score . With a final result of 21 – 7 , the Maryland players carried Mont to the Queen and Prince Philip 's box . Mont said it was a day that " I will revel in for the rest of my life . " 
 In 1958 , however , Maryland again <unk> with a 4 – 6 record and Mont subsequently resigned . 
 = = = Tom Nugent ( 1959 @-@ 1965 ) = = = 
 At the first practice before the 1959 season , new Terps head football coach Tom Nugent addressed his team , " Hi , I 'm Tom Nugent and I hate West Virginia . " The Mountaineers were Maryland 's first opponent of the season , and Nugent guided the Terrapins to a 27 – 7 victory in that game . 
 In 1961 , Nugent 's Maryland team became the first college football program in the nation to put players ' names on the back of their jerseys . That season , he led the Terrapins to the best season of his tenure and finished with a 7 – 3 record . The Terrapins also defeated seventh @-@ ranked Syracuse , 22 – 21 . 
 Nugent amassed a 36 – 34 record during his tenure at Maryland . He remained the last Maryland coach to win his inaugural game with the team until Ralph Friedgen matched that feat in 2001 . 
 Under Nugent , in 1962 , Maryland integrated its football team after Darryl Hill caught the eye of Maryland assistant coach Lee <unk> who had been encouraged by Nugent to find a black athlete to play for his team . Hill became not only the first African @-@ American football player at Maryland but the first in the Atlantic Coast Conference and at any college or university in " the old South . " 
 = = = Lou Saban ( 1966 ) = = = 
 In a surprising move , Lou Saban unexpectedly resigned as head coach of the AFL 's Buffalo Bills in January 1966 to the head football coach position at Maryland . He said he was leaving because " there can be little left to conquer in professional football " . His record at Buffalo was 36 – 17 – 3 . Saban , however , only stayed at Maryland for one season in which the team posted a 4 – 6 record , as he departed back to the AFL to become head coach of the Denver Broncos . 
 = = = Bob Ward ( 1967 @-@ 1968 ) = = = 
 In 1967 , Bob Ward returned to his alma mater to take the head coaching position . Before the season , 12 players failed to academically qualify to play on the team . During that first season , the team lost all nine of their games for the first time in the modern era . Ward 's second year saw slight improvement , recording eight losses but with wins over North Carolina and South Carolina . However , many of his players were growing increasingly disgruntled with his coaching style . 
 In March 1969 , Maryland athletic director Jim Kehoe called a meeting among 120 players , Ward , his assistants , and a three @-@ man committee . Thirty @-@ one of those players told Ward that they no longer wished to play for the Terrapins and accused him of using intimidation tactics , including verbal and physical abuse . Ward listened to the player 's grievances , but did not respond at the time . Two days later , he resigned as head coach . Later that year , Sports Illustrated interviewed Ward , and he said : 
 " I won 't go into all the specifics , but it wasn 't the good players who started it . It was the guys who couldn 't fight their way out of a paper bag , guys who sat on the bench and couldn 't take it and a couple of pip @-@ squeak cub newspaper guys who don 't know what football 's all about ... He gets on the campus newspaper and all of a sudden he 's got power he never thought of having . " 
 The Diamondback , the university 's student newspaper , had criticized Ward for moving the team into one dormitory , which forced some other students out . Ward stated that the move was done on the advice of Kehoe — which Kehoe denied — and with the intent of focusing the players on their studies and building camaraderie . Ward and his assistants monitored the players ' academic performance , enforced class attendance , and placed curfews on perceived troublemakers . Ward stated that , in his first year , only two of his players failed out of the school that he claimed had a history of poor athlete academics . He complained that he was a scapegoat and that there had been poor communication between him and Kehoe . In fact , Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was concerned with the situation surrounding Ward 's resignation and sent a letter to the American Football Coaches Association demanding an investigation . Paterno said : 
 " I don 't know who 's right or wrong , but ... I don 't think it 's a good thing for a squad to fire a coach . As an association , we ought to know what happened . If a university fired an English professor because his class didn 't like the way he was doing things , I know darn well that the American Association of University Professors would want to know what happened . " 
 = = = Roy Lester ( 1969 @-@ 1971 ) = = = 
 In 1969 , Roy Lester was hired as Maryland 's fourth head coach in five years . 
 Lester had previously twice applied for the Maryland head coach position , but didn 't get it . The Daytona Beach Morning Journal speculated that Lester 's undisclosed salary probably matched that of Ward : $ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 Lester reintroduced the split @-@ T formation at Maryland , which Jim Tatum had used to great effect there in the 1950s . 
 Lester 's philosophy was explained by the Maryland sports information director Jack Zane : " the pass should open up the defense for the running game . " In the sixth game of his first season , Maryland 's starting quarterback , junior Dennis O 'Hara , was injured in a loss at South Carolina , and was replaced by sophomore Jeff <unk> . 
 In the season 's penultimate game , Maryland lost to Penn State , 48 – 0 . Penn State halfback <unk> Mitchell had been recruited by Lester and originally intended to go to Maryland before he opted for Penn State instead . Lester was bothered by a similar situation with fullback Franco Harris , whose high school coach was a friend of Lester 's . Lester attributed Maryland 's football woes to the turnover at head coach and lack of depth because of recruitment shortcomings . Maryland won the finale against Virginia to finish the season with a 3 – 7 record . 
 In 1970 , Lester 's Terrapins finished with a 2 – 9 record . After an upset loss in the season opener against Villanova , 21 – 3 , Lester shuffled the roster . He switched the positions of eight players , which included Tom Miller from fullback to <unk> season prior , Miller had gained 629 yards , the second @-@ most ever by a Maryland sophomore . 
 After losing their first five games , Maryland beat South Carolina on Homecoming weekend , 21 – 15 , which prompted Maryland fans to tear down the goalposts in <unk> the 25 @-@ mile per hour winds , the Terrapins capitalized on the Gamecocks ' poor punting game , which included one blocked punt . 
 Two weeks later , Maryland was beaten by Clemson , which scored 21 points in the fourth quarter to win , 24 – 11 . 
 With the loss , Maryland slid to a 1 – 7 record , and Lester said he was giving serious consideration to stepping down before the next season . He said , " If I 'm not doing the proper job I 'm willing to relinquish the job . I took this loss very personally . " 
 In 1971 , some observers considered Maryland , which returned 37 lettermen , to be the dark horse in the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) . Lester said he expected a winning season and that " a lot of people may be surprised . " 
 However , the Terrapins dropped the season opener to underdog Villanova once again , 28 – <unk> @-@ News called it the most stunning of five upsets in the ACC teams ' opening weekend , rating it ahead of NC State 's loss to Kent State , Virginia 's loss to Navy , South Carolina 's win against Georgia Tech , and Duke 's win against <unk> won the following week against NC State , but then dropped five straight before beating the Virginia Military Institute on Homecoming . Maryland closed the season with losses to Penn State , Clemson , and Virginia to again finish with a 2 – 9 <unk> was fired at the conclusion of the 1971 season . Athletic director Jim Kehoe cited Maryland 's worst record in the ACC for two consecutive years and stated his goal of making Maryland a " nationally ranked caliber " team . 
 Kehoe also said , " financial factors are a serious consideration , " and that home game attendance had fallen to its lowest point , which threatened the financial well @-@ being of the athletic department . Lester was replaced by Jerry Claiborne , who later went on to considerable success in the position . 
 In September 1973 , Maryland All @-@ American guard Paul <unk> , then playing under Claiborne , said of the past coaches ' difficulties : " A lot of the kids said that Ward was a good coach but that he had a lot of bad apples . Lester was a high school coach and nobody had ever heard of him . I can 't understand it . We had nine freshman who were All @-@ Americans my first year here under Lester . Maybe if they had let him stay he could have done the job . 
 One of Lester 's lasting contributions was the recruitment of future Maryland and NFL star Randy White . 
 At the end of his tenure , Lester had a combined collegiate coaching record of 7 – 25 . 
 = = = Jerry Claiborne ( 1972 – 1981 ) = = = 
 In 1972 , Jerry Claiborne took over as head coach of the Terrapins , which had only nine wins in the past five years . In his first season , Maryland improved to 5 – 5 – 1 , and the following year , they reached their first bowl game in almost two decades . The team steadily improved until his fifth season , 1976 , when they finished the regular season with an 11 – 0 record , their first perfect mark since Tatum 's 1955 squad . Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne 's coaching style as " vanilla " , and said his strategy was " run right , run left , run up the middle , punt , and play good defense . " He went on to say , " But , there 's no question he made me a tougher player . . . We 'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker . It was like he had a sign on our back , ' Hit us , we 're stupid ' . It made you a tougher player . " 
 In 1974 , Maryland had a preseason rank of 14th and later beat 17th @-@ ranked NC State to win the ACC championship . The Terrapins were defeated by 20th @-@ ranked Tennessee in the Liberty Bowl and finished the season ranked 13th . In 1975 , Maryland again won the ACC and defeated 13th @-@ ranked Florida in the Gator Bowl to finish 13th in the nation . That season , the Terrapins led the ACC in total offense with 375 @.@ 2 yards per game . Maryland started 1976 ranked 12th , and quarterback Mark <unk> led them to eleven consecutive wins to secure their third straight ACC championship . Maryland 's loss to sixth @-@ ranked Houston in the Cotton Bowl Classic , 30 – 21 , ended any hopes for a national championship . 
 In 1978 , Maryland beat 20th @-@ ranked NC State and finished with a ranking of 20th . The game that pitted 11th @-@ ranked Maryland against 12th @-@ ranked Clemson has been described as one of the most exciting games of the era . The " big @-@ play caravan " ultimately saw Clemson triumph , 28 – 24 . From 1974 to 1978 , Claiborne and the Terrapins secured five consecutive bowl game berths and three consecutive ACC championships . Maryland made it to a sixth bowl game in 1980 . After the 1981 season , Claiborne left the program for his alma mater , Kentucky , and was replaced by Bobby Ross , an assistant coach for the Kansas City Chiefs . 
 = = = Bobby Ross ( 1982 – 1986 ) = = = 
 In a surprising choice , former Maryland assistant coach and Citadel head coach Bobby Ross , who was not a big name at the time , was selected as head coach in 1982 . In contrast to Claiborne 's style , Ross implemented a high @-@ powered offense . He replaced the I @-@ veer triple option with an NFL @-@ style offense that emphasized <unk> passes , bootlegs , and play action passes . This change in tactics and strategy enabled starting quarterback Boomer Esiason the opportunity to excel to a degree not seen under Claiborne the season prior . Esiason said , " Ross has an uncanny knack of putting players in a position to not only succeed , but to overachieve . . . If he didn 't show up at Maryland , I don 't know what would have happened to me . I don 't know if I would have turned into the player I was and played in the NFL . " In the following years , several Maryland quarterbacks went on to careers in the National Football League ( NFL ) , and the school was nicknamed " Quarterback U " as a result . 
 In Ross 's inaugural season , Maryland defeated 10th @-@ ranked North Carolina , and then edged Miami before their most important conference game of the season against the 1981 national champions , the Clemson Tigers . Between 1974 and 1988 , either Clemson or Maryland won the ACC title all but three years . Clemson had lost to the 1980 national champions , seventh @-@ ranked Georgia , 13 – 7 , and tied Boston College , 17 – 17 , after the opposing quarterback , Doug Flutie , led a comeback . Clemson was therefore unable to defend their NCAA championship , but either Clemson or Maryland , with perfect conference records , would secure the ACC title . Thus , decades before the official ACC Championship Game , 1982 saw a rare de facto title match . Clemson scored first , then pulled away 14 – 7 before half . In the second half , a favorable wind twice yielded Maryland excellent field position , Esiason threw for two rapid @-@ fire touchdowns and a two @-@ point conversion , and the defense held Clemson at bay . However , the Terrapins also turned the ball over five times in the second half and lost , 24 – 22 . With the win , Clemson won the ACC and Maryland finished second . Immediately after the game , the NCAA announced its investigation into Clemson recruiting had found improprieties . As a result , the Tigers were denied a bowl game and television coverage in the following season . The ACC instituted further punishment , making Clemson ineligible for a conference title for the next two years . Maryland finished 1982 ranked 20th after losing to ninth @-@ ranked Washington in the Aloha Bowl . In 1983 , Maryland lost to third @-@ ranked Auburn and 20th @-@ ranked West Virginia , but beat 17th @-@ ranked Pittsburgh and third @-@ ranked North Carolina . Clemson and Maryland once more met with perfect ACC records , and Maryland again lost , this time blown out , 52 – 27 . Despite the loss , Maryland was awarded the conference championship because of the sanctions against Clemson . 
 In 1984 , Maryland defeated the defending national champions , sixth @-@ ranked Miami , in what was then the biggest comeback in college football history and judged by some as the most exciting . At half time , Maryland trailed Miami , 31 – 0 . Back @-@ up quarterback Frank Reich replaced Stan <unk> and proceeded to throw four touchdown passes , and capitalizing on Miami errors , the Terrapins won , 42 – 40 . The recovery from the 31 @-@ point halftime deficit stood as the greatest college football comeback for the next 22 years , until the record was finally broken by Michigan State against Northwestern . Reich later repeated the feat in his professional career when he led the Buffalo Bills to overcome a 32 @-@ point deficit and set the NFL comeback record . That season , Maryland also defeated 17th @-@ ranked West Virginia and 20th @-@ ranked Clemson , and secured the ACC championship . In the postseason , they edged Tennessee , 28 – 27 , in the Sun Bowl and finished 12th in the nation . Maryland entered the 1985 season with a number @-@ one preseason rank , and set its all @-@ time home attendance record in Byrd Stadium with an average of 49 @,@ 385 over five games . However , they dropped to a ranking of 17th in Week 2 , and then out of the polls in Week 4 after a shutout by Michigan . Despite the early setbacks , the Terrapins finished undefeated in six conference games to take the ACC championship for the third consecutive year . Maryland defeated Syracuse , 35 @-@ 18 , in the Cherry Bowl and earned a final ranking of 18th . In 1986 , the Terrapins posted a mediocre 5 – 5 – 1 record . 
 After the season , Ross resigned as head coach . He expressed frustration over the university 's failure to improve Byrd Stadium and its associated facilities . Ross had shown recruits stadium and facility renovation plans as an indication of the program 's direction , and when they did not come to fruition , he felt that he had misled the players . Ross also stated that he was hurt by " innuendo , insinuation , and guilt by association " with respect to the cocaine @-@ induced death of Maryland basketball star Len Bias . He said , " I feel the football team has represented the university well , both on and off the field . " The athletics department investigation report had commended the propriety of the football program , but university chancellor John B. Slaughter did not offer his vocal support for Ross until a month later . 
 = = = Joe Krivak ( 1987 – 1991 ) = = = 
 Maryland athletics in general were marred by the death of Len Bias , and the football team was no exception . After Ross resigned , offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Joe Krivak was promoted to head coach . This was the beginning of a lackluster period for Terrapins football . From 1987 to 2000 , the Terrapins went 55 – 88 overall ( .385 ) with only two winning seasons and one bowl appearance . The Krivak era was met with a brutal schedule with non @-@ conference opponents consisting of national powers Michigan , Miami , Penn State , and Syracuse among others . After a 4 @-@ 7 season in 1987 , a controversial loss to Virginia in the final game of 1988 cost the team a sixth win for bowl eligibility . In 1989 , Maryland tied Joe Paterno 's 13th @-@ ranked Penn <unk> existence . The following season , the Terrapins beat 25th @-@ ranked West Virginia and upset 8th @-@ ranked Virginia . Maryland received a bid to the Independence Bowl and tied Louisiana Tech in what would be their only postseason appearance during this period . Athletic director Andy Geiger rewarded Krivak with a five @-@ year contract extension , but the 1991 season unraveled after a rash of injuries , and Maryland had its worst finish in two decades with a 2 – 9 mark . After public criticism from several players , Krivak felt he lost credibility as the head coach and resigned on December 6 . 
 = = = Mark Duffner ( 1992 @-@ 1996 ) = = = 
 Geiger named Holy Cross head coach Mark Duffner as Krivak 's replacement . Duffner had amassed a 60 – 5 – 1 record and two undefeated seasons in his six years at Holy Cross . At Maryland , he installed a run and shoot offense which shattered many school records . However , his defenses were notoriously weak , usually giving up points so quickly that even his prolific offense couldn 't keep up . For example , in the 1993 game against Virginia Tech , the Terrapins lost by 27 points despite gaining 649 yards of total offense . During this time , quarterbacks Scott Milanovich and John <unk> set numerous school records for passing under Duffner , most of which still stand . In 1993 , Maryland earned the dubious honor of most yards allowed per game , a record which also stands : in eleven games , the Terrapins surrendered 6 @,@ 083 yards — an average of 553 @.@ 0 yards per game . Maryland also gave up 236 more points than they scored , the worst point differential in school history . After the season , Duffner reorganized his staff by firing three assistant coaches . The team showed moderate improvement the next two years , and in 1995 finished 6 – 5 , which was the first winning record since 1990 . However , Maryland <unk> in 1996 with a 5 – 6 record and a struggling offense . Duffner was fired after the season , having accumulated a combined record of 20 – 35 . 
 = = = Ron Vanderlinden ( 1997 @-@ 2000 ) = = = 
 Ron Vanderlinden was hired as head coach for the 1997 season under a five @-@ year contract . Vanderlinden had helped engineer turnarounds at Northwestern as defensive coordinator and at Colorado as a defensive assistant . The 1995 Northwestern team in particular had shocked observers when it recorded a 10 – 2 season and the Big Ten championship . In 1999 , Maryland showed signs of significant improvement , and a winning season appeared certain when Maryland possessed a 5 – 2 record . The Terrapins , however , then suffered a three @-@ game losing streak . In their finale against Virginia , the Terrapins needed a win to garner a likely invitation to either the Aloha Bowl or Oahu Bowl — a Maryland alumnus was the chief executive officer of both events . The Terrapins came from behind and held the lead , 30 – 27 , with 5 : 18 left to play . They regained possession with 1 : 40 remaining , but an inexperienced quarterback unintentionally stopped the clock by going out of bounds . After the ensuing punt , Virginia mounted a touchdown drive to win the game and end Maryland 's bowl hopes . Despite narrowly missing a winning season , Vanderlinden was granted a two @-@ year contract extension . In 2000 , Maryland again fell short of a winning season and bowl game . The Terrapins entered their season closer with a 5 – 5 record , and again fell , this time in a rout by 24th @-@ ranked Georgia Tech . Vanderlinden was fired the following day . 
 Despite the failure to deliver a winning season , Vanderlinden did oversee substantive improvement in the program . In 1998 , the Terrapins were one of the most improved teams in defense , scoring defense , passing defense , and rushing . In 1999 , Maryland allowed a conference low of 11 sacks compared with 56 in 1997 . In that same period , Maryland also improved from last to first in the conference in rushing , due in large part to Heisman Trophy candidate and school career rushing leader <unk> Jordan . During Vanderlinden 's tenure , Maryland also recruited several key players who were instrumental in the team 's later success . 
 = = = Ralph Friedgen ( 2001 – 2010 ) = = = 
 Ralph Friedgen , a former Maryland player and assistant under Bobby Ross , was hired as Vanderlinden 's replacement for the 2001 season . Friedgen had previously been denied an interview for the position twice by his alma mater . While offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech , he had been described as an " offensive genius " , and Friedgen later received similar plaudits while at Maryland . When he took over , Maryland had not won a bowl game in 16 years and had only one winning season since 1990 . 
 In 2001 , Maryland won its first four games and entered the AP Poll for the first time since September 1995 . Maryland beat 15th @-@ ranked Georgia Tech in overtime when placekicker Nick Novak , the ACC 's future all @-@ time scoring leader , equalized and then won the game with <unk> and 26 @-@ yard field goals , thereby ensuring a winning season and bowl appearance . In Tallahassee , 18th @-@ ranked Florida State broke a stalemate in the fourth quarter to hand Maryland its only defeat of the regular season , 52 – 31 . Maryland closed the year with a win over NC State , which secured the ACC championship and made the Terrapins the first team other than Florida State to take the title outright since the Seminoles joined the conference in 1991 . Sixth @-@ ranked Maryland then faced fifth @-@ ranked Florida in the Orange Bowl — their first @-@ ever BCS appearance , and their first major bowl of any sort since the 1977 Cotton Bowl . The Terrapins lost , 56 – 23 , and finished with a 10 – 2 record and ranked 10th in the nation . 
 In 2002 , Maryland had a preseason rank of 20th , but their first three games included a shutout by 12th @-@ ranked Notre Dame , 22 – 0 , and a loss to 16th @-@ ranked Florida State , 37 – 10 . The Terrapins rallied to defeat 13th @-@ ranked West Virginia and 17th @-@ ranked NC State , while losing only to Virginia . That loss , however , prevented Maryland from earning a share of the ACC championship alongside Florida State . The Terrapins routed Tennessee in the Peach Bowl , 30 – 3 , and finished with an 11 – 3 record and final ranking of 18th . Maryland began the 2003 season with losses to Northern Illinois and eighth @-@ ranked Florida State . They later defeated 23rd @-@ ranked West Virginia , but were edged by Georgia Tech . In the postseason , 24th @-@ ranked Maryland delivered a second crushing defeat against 20th @-@ ranked West Virginia in the Gator Bowl , 41 – 7 , and finished the season ranked 17th . The New York Times computer poll ranked Maryland third in the nation , behind only split @-@ national champions Louisiana State and Southern California . The 2004 season was Friedgen 's first with a losing record . Maryland finished with a 5 – 6 mark that included an overtime loss to West Virginia , 19 – 16 . The highlight of the season was an upset victory over fifth @-@ ranked Florida State , which was Maryland 's first against the Seminoles and their first win against a top @-@ 10 team since 1990 . The Terrapins again ended the 2005 season with a 5 – 6 record . That season opened with a victory over Navy , which was the first meeting between the intrastate foes in 40 years . 
 In 2006 , Maryland returned to a bowl game and finished with a 9 – 4 record . During the season , the Terrapins upset 19th @-@ ranked Clemson , 13 – 12 , and five of their games were won by four points or less . In the Champs Sports Bowl , Maryland beat Purdue , 24 – 7 . In 2007 , Maryland overcame extensive injuries to again secure a postseason appearance . During the season , unranked Maryland tallied two shocking upsets against 10th @-@ ranked Rutgers , 34 – 24 , and eighth @-@ ranked Boston College , 42 – 35 . They finished the season with a rout of NC State to attain bowl eligibility , 37 – 0 , but lost to Oregon State in the Emerald Bowl , 21 – 14 . According to the final Sagarin computer @-@ generated rankings , Maryland had the second @-@ hardest schedule in the ACC and the 27th @-@ hardest schedule among Division I teams . 
 Numerous observers described Maryland 's 2008 season as " wildly inconsistent " . The Terrapins defeated four of their five ranked opponents — 25th @-@ ranked California , 19th @-@ ranked Clemson , 19th @-@ ranked Wake Forest , and 17th @-@ ranked North Carolina — but also lost to heavy underdogs Middle Tennessee and Virginia . Ultimately , Maryland defeated Nevada in the Humanitarian Bowl and finished the season with an 8 – 5 record . Before the 2009 season , many analysts projected the Terrapins to finish last or second @-@ to @-@ last in the Atlantic Division of the ACC , and expressed particular concern with the inexperienced offensive line . The prognostications proved accurate , and Maryland finished 2 – 10 for their first ten @-@ loss season in program history . Maryland rebounded in 2010 to finish with a 9 – 4 record , including a win in the Military Bowl , and ranked 23rd in the AP Poll . The ACC named Friedgen Coach of the Year , while freshman quarterback Danny O 'Brien became the first Terrapin ever named ACC Rookie of the Year . Citing lack of fan support , the athletic department bought out the final year of Friedgen 's contract for $ 2 million . 
 = = = Randy Edsall ( 2011 – 2015 ) = = = 
 After Friedgen was let go , the Terrapins hired Randy Edsall away from Connecticut to be Maryland 's head coach . The 2011 season was not a successful one for Maryland . After a nationally televised win over Miami , the Terrapins struggled for the remainder of the season . They only managed to record one more win ( against FCS opponent Towson ) and finished with a 2 – 10 record . The team did attract national attention for its " Maryland Pride " uniforms that were created by Under Armour , who had become the official outfitter of the Maryland Athletic Department in September 2008 . 
 After the 2011 season , Edsall fired both his offensive coordinator Gary Crowton and his defensive coordinator Todd Bradford . Mike Locksley , who had been fired in 2011 from his head coaching position at New Mexico , was hired to be the new offensive coordinator . Locksley had previously worked at Maryland under head coaches Vanderlinden and Friedgen , and was the recruiting coordinator for Maryland before and during the three consecutive 10 + win seasons under Friedgen . Brian Stewart , who had been the defensive coordinator for the Houston Cougars , was hired to replace Bradford as the new defensive coordinator . 
 Edsall 's 2012 team compiled a 4 – 8 record , losing four quarterbacks to injury , and eventually starting a linebacker at the position . The team 's record improved from 2011 nonetheless but still not as much as fans , alumni and the administration had hoped . 
 The 2013 Maryland Terrapins football team under head coach Edsall improved to 7 – 6 , capping the season with a loss in the Military Bowl to Marshall , The 61st and final season the Terrapins would be playing football in the Atlantic Coast Conference . 
 Edsall 's 2014 Terps finished their regular season with a 7 – 5 record , comprising a 4 – 4 record in Big Ten Conference play that put them third in the Big Ten East Division , their Inaugural season in the Big Ten Conference . Maryland ended its season at the Foster Farms Bowl , where it lost to Stanford . 
 On October 11 , 2015 , Edsall was relieved of his duties with offensive coordinator Mike Locksley named as the interim head coach for the rest of the 2015 season .

 On December 2 , 2015 , the Terps announced that former Michigan defensive coordinator D. J. Durkin will be named the new head coach . 
 = = Home stadium = = 
 During its first few decades , the football program had only one poorly suited athletic field on which to play and practice and had no dedicated facilities such as locker rooms . Former coach and contemporary university president Dr. Harry C. Byrd allocated funds for the construction of a stadium in 1915 , and it was completed in 1923 . The Board of Regents voted to name it Byrd Stadium in honor of its main advocate . The stadium 's capacity was 5 @,@ 000 . During this time , it was common for Maryland to play its better @-@ drawing games in larger stadiums in Washington , D.C. or Baltimore . 
 In 1950 , that small field was replaced by the identically named but much larger Byrd Stadium , which was constructed at the cost of $ 1 million . The new stadium had an initial capacity of 34 @,@ 680 , which has since been upgraded to 51 @,@ 055 through extensive additions . Shortly after its construction , the stadium hosted its dedication game against Navy , which Maryland won 35 – 21 . That same year , the new field held its first and only bowl game , the Presidential Cup Bowl , which featured Texas A & M and Georgia . In 2006 , the University of Maryland became the first school to sell naming rights to its field . The home field was officially branded " Chevy Chase Bank Field at Byrd Stadium " in a 25 @-@ year , $ 20 million contract . In 2008 , Chevy Chase Bank was bought out by Capital One , and the stadium was renamed Capital One Field at Byrd Stadium . On December 11 , 2015 , the Board of Regents voted 12 @-@ 5 to remove the " Byrd " from the stadium 's name because of Harry " Curley " Byrd 's segregationist history , renaming it Maryland Stadium for the time being .

 When the school was known as the Maryland Agricultural College , from 1856 to 1916 , the media called the athletics teams the " Farmers " and the " Aggies " . As the University of Maryland , the teams became known as " The Old Liners " in reference to the state nickname . During the 1923 season , The New York Times referred to Maryland as the Orioles , after a bird species endemic to the region that was already the namesake for several baseball teams . In 1932 , Curley Byrd suggested that the namesake become the diamondback terrapin ( <unk> terrapin ) , a species of land @-@ dwelling turtle common throughout the state , particularly the Chesapeake Bay area where Dr. Byrd spent his early life . The student newspaper had already been named The Diamondback since 1921 , and the athletics teams were sometimes referred to as the " Terrapins " as early as 1928 . Newspapers began referring to the team simply as the " Terps " to shorten headlines . The truncated name stuck and is now in official use by the school . 
 The mascot is a diamondback terrapin named Testudo , which means " turtle " in Latin . It is also the name of an ancient Roman military tactic , in which soldiers protected their infantry square from projectiles by completely enclosing it with their shields . Derivations of the word have also been used in scientific nomenclature related to the reptile , such as the order <unk> and the family <unk> . In 1933 , the graduating class raised funds for a 300 @-@ pound bronze replica of a terrapin . It was initially placed in front of Ritchie Coliseum , which was then the home arena of the basketball team . In 1951 , after being the subject of numerous pranks , the statue was relocated to Maryland Stadium , reinforced with 700 pounds of concrete , and anchored with steel rods . It was moved again in the 1960s , in front of McKeldin Library , and a second replica was placed at Maryland Stadium in 1992 . In the 2000s , under coach Ralph Friedgen , it was a pregame tradition for the football players to walk 200 yards , through what is known as " <unk> Alley " , to the locker rooms , and touch the bronze Testudo . 
 = = = Colors = = = 
 Originally , the athletic teams had no official colors and often used gray or maroon and gray for their uniforms . Senior classes would sometimes select colors of their own choosing . In modern times , the uniforms have been based on some combination of the four colors of the Maryland flag : red , white , black , and gold . The dominant colors have occasionally changed back and forth with changes of the head coach . In 1904 , Maryland adopted a state flag based on the heraldry of Lord Calvert : the Calvert family arms ( black and gold ) quartered with his mother 's Crossland family arms ( red and white ) . From the early 1920s until 1942 , the black and gold were adopted as the official school colors . 
 In 1942 , Clark Shaughnessy left Stanford to coach at Maryland . He brought with him an affinity for a red and white color scheme and changed the team 's uniforms . Shaughnessy left after one season , and the school switched back to the more traditional black and gold . He returned in 1946 and again changed the colors to red and white . When Jim Tatum replaced him the following season , Shaughnessy 's colors were retained . In 1961 , Maryland wore gold jerseys with black numerals for the first time since 1945 for their season opener against Southern Methodist . In 1987 , Joe Krivak introduced black jerseys with the Maryland flag on the sleeves for selected games and then black pants followed in 1991 . Ron Vanderlinden took over in 1997 and a new black and white uniform was adopted . Under Ralph Friedgen , Maryland returned to red and white in 2001 , with black uniforms being reserved for select games . Maryland was one of the first schools to utilize the " blackout " concept , where fans uniformly wear the color to stand out in the stadium . It was introduced unofficially as the " Byrd Blackout " in 2005 . For the 2011 season , Maryland wore new Under Armour uniforms that offered a " dizzying array " of combinations in the four school colors . In the season opener against Miami , the Terrapins unveiled a unique uniform based on the Maryland state flag that received nationwide media attention . In recent years since 2001 under Ralph Friedgen and continued by Randy Edsall , Maryland has worn a uniform combination of all @-@ red , red jerseys and red pants for the annual game on homecoming weekend .

 Maryland and Penn State have met 39 times since the 1917 season . Although Penn State leads the series with a lopsided 36 @-@ 2 @-@ 1 record against Maryland , many of those games were decided by field goals and turnovers . Because Maryland was in the ACC before joining the Big 10 Conference in July of 2014 , this rivalry was mainly kept alive through recruiting .

 SR 525 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to Secondary State Highway 1D ( SSH 1D ) on Whidbey Island and SSH 1I in Mukilteo and Lynnwood , themselves established in 1937 . The highway , at its codification in 1970 , traversed the north – south length of Whidbey Island and ended at SR 536 near Anacortes until it was replaced by SR 20 in 1973 . SR 525 was converted to its present freeway in Lynnwood during the 1980s and widened to four lanes during the late 1990s , including an overpass over SR 99 . The highway also has a spur route in Mukilteo that has connected SR 525 to SR 526 via Paine Field Boulevard since it was signed in 2001 .

 SR 525 begins at the Swamp Creek Interchange with I @-@ 5 , also serving as the northern terminus of I @-@ 405 , located in Lynnwood in southern Snohomish County . The four @-@ lane controlled @-@ access freeway travels north past Alderwood Mall and a partial cloverleaf interchange with Alderwood Mall Parkway , which serves the eponymous mall . SR 525 continues north under overpasses carrying 164th Street and 148th Street before reaching its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 99 , where the freeway ends . The highway becomes the four @-@ lane Mukilteo Speedway and travels northwest into the city of Mukilteo , serving its commercial and industrial areas located south of Paine Field . SR 525 intersects its spur route , which travels north as Paine Field Boulevard towards the Boeing Everett Factory , before it serves as the western terminus of SR 526 . The highway gains a ferry holding lane on its northbound shoulder as it approaches the Mukilteo ferry terminal , located between the Mukilteo Lighthouse Park and the local train station , where the designation of SR 525 is carried onto the Whidbey Island Ferry across Possession Sound . The ferry , operated by Washington State Ferries ( WSF ) , takes approximately 20 minutes for each of its 39 daily round @-@ trip crossings . As of May 2012 , WSF charges a fare of $ 4 @.@ 65 per walk @-@ on passenger and $ 7 @.@ 85 per vehicle during off @-@ peak seasons , with varying fares depending on passenger age and vehicle size . SR 525 leaves the ferry terminal at Clinton and travels west through the interior of Whidbey Island in unincorporated Island County as part of the Whidbey Island Scenic Byway , a state scenic byway . The highway turns north along Holmes Harbor in Freeland and continues through Greenbank before SR 525 terminates at SR 20 south of Coupeville . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2012 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 525 was its southern terminus at I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 405 , serving 61 @,@ 000 vehicles , while the least busiest section of the highway was at the Mukilteo ferry terminal , serving 5 @,@ 700 vehicles . SR 525 is designated as part of the National Highway System from Lynnwood to the Mukilteo ferry terminal , classifying it as important to the national economy , defense , and mobility .

 = = History = = 
 SR 525 uses the Whidbey Island Ferry between Mukilteo and Clinton , which began as a route of the Island Transportation Company in 1919 . The ferry was later taken over by the Puget Sound Navigation Company , who were sold to the state of Washington in 1951 during the formation of the WSF . The discontinuous road sections of SR 525 were added to the state highway system in 1937 as SSH 1D and SSH 1I , both branches of PSH 1 . SSH 1D traveled 54 @.@ 73 miles ( 88 @.@ 08 km ) on Whidbey and Fidalgo islands from the Clinton ferry dock to an intersection with the Anacortes branch of PSH 1 at Sharps Corner . SSH 1I traveled 10 @.@ 63 miles ( 17 @.@ 11 km ) in a circular arc from Everett to Lynnwood , traveling on Mukilteo Boulevard and the Mukilteo Speedway . 
 SR 525 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering and codified in 1970 as the successor to both SSH 1D and SSH 1I , traveling 62 @.@ 04 miles ( 99 @.@ 84 km ) north from the newly constructed Swamp Creek Interchange at I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 405 in Lynnwood , opened in 1965 , to SR 536 south of Anacortes . The highway was truncated to its present terminus south of Coupeville after SR 20 was extended east as the North Cascades Highway in 1973 . SR 525 was re @-@ aligned onto a two @-@ lane freeway within Lynnwood in the 1980s replacing the local streets it had used to connect to I @-@ 5 and SR 99 . The Swamp Creek Interchange , where SR 525 meets I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 405 , was opened in November 1984 . 
 WSF ferry routes were added to its respective state highways in 1994 , eliminating one of two gaps along the route of SR 525 , the other being a concurrency with SR 99 that was replaced by a partial cloverleaf interchange in 2000 during the widening of the freeway segment in Lynnwood . A spur route , located completely in Mukilteo , was added to SR 525 in 2001 along the route of the four @-@ lane Paine Field Boulevard , connecting the main highway to SR 526 .

 SR 525 has a 0 @.@ 86 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 1 @.@ 38 km ) spur route on Paine Field Boulevard in Mukilteo that connects the northbound lanes of the Mukilteo Speedway to SR 526 eastbound towards Everett and the local Boeing factory . Paine Field Boulevard was built in 1999 and signed as SR 525 Spur in 2001 , subsequently being widened and improved in 2003 by WSDOT . A proposal to extend Paine Field Boulevard through Japanese Gulch and create a bypass of the Mukilteo ferry terminal has been a part of the city 's transportation plan since 2001 , but has not been built . WSDOT estimated , during its annual AADT survey , that 21 @,@ 000 vehicles used the highway in 2012 .

 Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta was born on March 28 , 1986 , at the Lenox Hill Hospital on Manhattan 's Upper East Side to a Catholic family . She is the elder daughter of Cynthia Louise " Cindy " ( <unk> ) and Internet entrepreneur Joseph Anthony " Joe " Germanotta , Jr . Gaga is of 75 percent Italian descent , and also has French Canadian ancestry . Gaga 's sister Natali is a fashion student . Despite her affluent upbringing on Manhattan 's Upper West Side , she says that her parents " both came from lower @-@ class families , so we 've worked for everything — my mother worked eight to eight out of the house , in telecommunications , and so did my father . " From age eleven , she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart , a private , all @-@ girls Roman Catholic school on Manhattan 's Upper East Side . She described her academic life in high school as " very dedicated , very studious , very disciplined " but also " a bit insecure " . " I used to get made fun of for being either too provocative or too eccentric , so I started to tone it down . I didn 't fit in , and I felt like a freak . " Gaga began playing the piano at the age of four , wrote her first piano ballad at thirteen , and started to perform at open mic nights by the age of fourteen . She performed lead roles in high school productions , including Adelaide in Guys and Dolls and <unk> in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum . She also appeared in a very small role as a mischievous classmate in the television drama series The Sopranos in a 2001 episode titled " The Telltale <unk> " . She auditioned for New York shows without success . She also studied method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute for ten years .

 = = = 2005 – 07 : Career beginnings = = = 
 At age 19 , Gaga withdrew from CAP21 in the second semester of her sophomore year , deciding to focus on her musical career . In the mid @-@ 2005 , Gaga recorded a couple of songs with hip @-@ hop singer Grandmaster Melle Mel , for an audio book accompanying Cricket Casey 's children 's book The Portal in the Park . She also formed a band called the Stefani Germanotta Band ( <unk> ) with some friends from NYU . The band played at gigs around New York becoming a local fixture of the downtown Lower East Side club scene . After the 2006 Songwriters Hall of Fame New Songwriters Showcase at The Cutting Room in June , Gaga was recommended to music producer Rob Fusari by talent scout Wendy Starland . Fusari collaborated with Gaga , who traveled daily to New Jersey , to work on songs she had written and to compose new material with him . According to the producer , they began dating in May 2006 , and he claimed to have created the " Lady Gaga " moniker after the Queen song " Radio Ga Ga " . The singer was in the process of trying to come up with a stage name when she received a text message from Fusari that read " Lady Gaga " . He explained , " Every day , when Stef came to the studio , instead of saying hello , I would start singing ' Radio Ga Ga ' " . The text message was the result of a predictive text glitch that changed " radio " to " lady " . Fusari said she texted back , " That 's it " , and declared , " Don 't ever call me Stefani again . " 
 Fusari and Gaga established a company called Team <unk> LLC to promote her career . They recorded and produced electropop tracks and sent them to music industry executives . Joshua Sarubin , the head of A & R at Def Jam Recordings , responded positively and after agreement from his boss , Antonio " L.A. " Reid , Gaga was signed to Def Jam in September 2006 . However , she was dropped by the label after only three months – a period of her life that later inspired the music video of her 2011 single " Marry the Night " . Devastated , Gaga returned to the solace of the family home for Christmas and the nightlife culture of the Lower East Side . She became increasingly experimental : fascinating herself with emerging neo @-@ burlesque shows , go @-@ go dancing at bars dressed in little more than a bikini , in addition to experimenting with drugs . Gaga explained her antics represented freedom : " I went to a Catholic school but it was on the New York underground that I found myself . " Her relationship with Fusari ended in January 2007 following which she became romantically involved with a heavy metal drummer . She compared this relationship and the subsequent breakup to the musical film Grease : " I was his Sandy , and he was my Danny , and I just broke . " 
 During this time , she met performance artist Lady Starlight , who helped mold her onstage persona . Like <unk> , the pair soon began performing at many of the downtown club venues like the Mercury Lounge , The Bitter End , and the Rockwood Music Hall . Their live performance art piece was known as " Lady Gaga and the Starlight Revue " and , billed as " The Ultimate Pop Burlesque Rockshow " , was a low @-@ fi tribute to 1970s variety acts . Their performance at the 2007 Lollapalooza music festival was critically acclaimed . 
 Having initially focused on avant @-@ garde electronic dance music , Gaga found her musical niche when she began to incorporate pop melodies and the glam rock of David Bowie and Queen into her music . While Gaga and Starlight were busy performing , Fusari continued to work on the songs he had created with Gaga . He sent these songs to his friend , producer and record executive Vincent Herbert . The latter was quick to sign her to his label Streamline Records , an imprint of Interscope Records , established in 2007 . Gaga later credited Herbert as the man who discovered her , adding : " I really feel like we made pop history , and we 're gonna keep going . " Having served as an apprentice songwriter during an internship at Famous Music Publishing , ( later acquired by Sony / ATV Music Publishing ) , Gaga subsequently struck a music publishing deal with Sony / ATV . As a result , she was hired to write songs for Britney Spears and label mates New Kids on the Block , Fergie , and The Pussycat Dolls . At Interscope , singer @-@ songwriter Akon recognized her vocal abilities when she sang a reference vocal for one of his tracks in studio . Akon then convinced Interscope Geffen A & M Chairman and CEO Jimmy Iovine to form a joint deal by having her also sign with his own label Kon Live , making her his " franchise player " . 
 Towards the end of 2007 , Gaga met with songwriter and producer RedOne . Gaga collaborated with him in the recording studio for a week on her debut album , and also joined the roster of Cherrytree Records , an Interscope imprint established by producer and songwriter Martin Kierszenbaum ; she also wrote four songs with Kierszenbaum . Despite her secure record deal , she admitted that there was fear about her being too " racy " , " dance @-@ oriented " and " underground " for the mainstream market . Her response : " My name is Lady Gaga , I 've been on the music scene for years , and I 'm telling you , this is what 's next . "

Lead single " Bad Romance " topped the charts in 18 countries and reached number two in the US , Australia and New Zealand ; it won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video . Two other singles were released from the EP , " Telephone " ( featuring Beyoncé ) and " Alejandro " .

Gaga clarified that she was : " actually asked to open for Michael on his tour ... We were going to open for him at the O2 and we were working on making it happen . I believe there was some talk about us , lots of the openers , doing duets with Michael on stage . " 
 During this era Gaga ventured into business , collaborating with consumer electronics company Monster Cable Products to create a pair of in @-@ ear , jewel @-@ encrusted , headphones titled Heartbeats . " They are designed to be the first ever fashion accessories that double as the absolute best sonically sounding headphones in the world , " she commented . Gaga also partnered with Polaroid in January 2010 as their Creative Director and revealed a trio of new photo capturing products called Grey Label . But her collaboration with past producer , and ex @-@ boyfriend , Rob Fusari led to her production team , Mermaid Music LLC , being sued in March 2010 when he claimed that he was entitled to a 20 % share of the company 's earnings . The New York Supreme Court dismissed both the lawsuit and a countersuit by Gaga . In addition to such strife , Gaga was tested borderline positive for lupus , but claimed not to be affected by the symptoms . The singer addressed the matter in an interview with Larry King , saying she hopes to avoid symptoms by maintaining a healthy lifestyle .

 Continually experimenting with new musical ideas and images , Gaga 's musical and performance style is the subject of much analysis and scrutiny from critics . She professes that she is " liberating " herself by constantly reinventing her sound and image , insisting that she has been drawn to such a practice since her childhood . Refusing to lip sync , Gaga – whose range is frequently compared to those of Madonna and Gwen Stefani – has manipulated her vocal style over the course of her career yet considers Born This Way ( 2011 ) " much more vocally up to par with what I 've always been capable of . " In summation of her voice , Entertainment Weekly wrote : " There 's an immense emotional intelligence behind the way she uses her voice . Almost never does she overwhelm a song with her vocal ability , recognizing instead that artistry is to be found in nuance rather than lung power . " 
 Although her early lyrics have been criticized for lacking intellectual stimulation , " [ Gaga ] does manage to get you moving and grooving at an almost effortless pace . " Gaga believes that " all good music can be played on a piano and still sound like a hit . " She has covered a wide variety of topics in her songs : while The Fame ( 2008 ) meditates on the lust for stardom , The Fame Monster ( 2009 ) expresses fame 's dark side through monster metaphors . Born This Way ( 2011 ) is sung in English , French , German , and Spanish and includes common themes in Gaga 's controversial songwriting such as : sex , love , religion , money , drugs , identity , liberation , sexuality , freedom , and individualism .

Her debut album The Fame ( 2008 ) provoked The Sunday Times to assert " in combining music , fashion , art and technology , [ Gaga ] evokes Madonna , Gwen Stefani circa ' Hollaback Girl ' , Kylie Minogue 2001 or Grace Jones right now " , and a critic from The Boston Globe to comment that she draws : " obvious inspirations from Madonna to Gwen Stefani ... in [ her ] girlish but sturdy pipes and bubbly beats . " Music critic Simon Reynolds wrote that : " Everything about Gaga came from electroclash , except the music , which wasn 't particularly 1980s , just ruthlessly catchy <unk> pop glazed with Auto @-@ Tune and undergirded with R & B @-@ ish beats . " The follow @-@ up The Fame Monster ( 2009 ) , saw Gaga 's taste for pastiche , drawing on " Seventies arena glam , perky ABBA disco , and sugary throwbacks like Stacey Q " while Born This Way ( 2011 ) also draws on the records of her childhood and still has the " electro @-@ sleaze beats and Eurodisco chorus chants " of its predecessor but includes genres as diverse as opera , heavy metal , disco , and rock and roll . " There isn 't a subtle moment on the album , but even at its nuttiest , the music is full of wide @-@ awake emotional details , " wrote Rolling Stone , which concluded : " The more excessive Gaga gets , the more honest she sounds . " With 2014 's Cheek to Cheek , Gaga dabbled in the jazz genre . Although critically appreciated for her love of the music , and the songs she recorded on the album , it was noted that Gaga 's attempt to switch genres , with " her rhythmically square , shouty delivery " , left her vocals sounding more like a Broadway singer than a real jazz musician . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 Gaga grew up listening to artists such as : The Beatles , Stevie Wonder , Queen , Bruce Springsteen , Pink Floyd , Mariah Carey , The Grateful Dead , Led Zeppelin , Whitney Houston , Elton John , Blondie , and Garbage , who all influenced her . She has cited heavy metal bands as an influence , stating that Iron Maiden " changed my life " and describing herself as " the biggest Black Sabbath fan on Earth " . Gaga 's musical inspiration varies from dance @-@ pop singers like Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists like David Bowie and Freddie Mercury , as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater . Gaga has often been compared to Madonna who admits that she sees herself reflected in Gaga . In response to the comparisons , Gaga stated in February 2011 : " I don 't want to sound presumptuous , but I 've made it my goal to revolutionize pop music . The last revolution was launched by Madonna 25 years ago " in addition to commenting that : " there is really no one that is a more adoring and loving Madonna fan than me . " Like Madonna , Gaga has continued to reinvent herself and has drawn inspiration from the music and performances of a diverse mix of artists including : Whitney Houston , Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry , Lily Allen , Marilyn Manson , Yoko Ono , Beyoncé , Britney Spears , and Christina Aguilera . 
 Another spiritual influence on Gaga has been the Indian physician , public speaker , and writer Deepak Chopra . Labeling him a " true inspiration " , she stated that " he 's always reminded me to work in a life of service to my fans and to fulfill my vision and my destiny " in addition to thinking about Chopra when it comes to her work as a musician : " I want so much for it to go beyond the music for my fans . " Gaga also lifted a quote from Osho 's book Creativity on Twitter . When asked about her connection to him , Gaga said she was influenced by his work and that , for her , " the creativity is the greatest way of rebellion " : " Equality " , she concluded , " is one of the most important things in my life . " 
 Gaga has identified fashion as a major influence and claimed that her interest in fashion came from her mother who was " always very well kept and beautiful . " Her musical endeavors are directly linked with fashion with the singer explaining : " When I 'm writing music , I 'm thinking about the clothes I want to wear on stage . It 's all about everything altogether — performance art , pop performance art , fashion . " Gaga has been stylistically compared to Leigh Bowery , Isabella Blow , and Cher . She commented that as a child , she somehow absorbed Cher 's out @-@ there fashion sense and made it her own . Gaga considers Donatella Versace her muse , and the late English fashion designer and close friend Alexander McQueen as an inspiration , admitting that " I miss Lee every time I get dressed " while channeling him in some of her work . In turn , Versace calls Lady Gaga " the fresh Donatella " . Modeled on Andy Warhol 's Factory , Gaga has her own creative production team , which she handles personally , called the Haus of Gaga , who create many of her clothes , stage props , and hairdos . Other fashion influences came from Princess Diana : " I love Princess Diana so much . She was an enormous influence on me when I was younger because my mother worshiped her so much . When she died , I 'll never forget , my mother was crying . It was this very powerful moment in my childhood watching my mother so connected to someone " . 
 = = = Videos and stage = = = 
 With constant costume changes and provocative visuals , Gaga 's music videos are often described as short films . " Being provocative is not just about getting people 's attention . It 's about saying something that really affects people in a real way , in a positive way , " she professes . According to author Curtis Fogel , exploring bondage and sadomasochism in addition to highlighting prevalent feminist themes , " the three central themes that shape Gaga 's music videos are sex , violence , and power . " While she labels herself " a little bit of a feminist " and asserts that she is " sexually empowering women " , Gaga strives to empower young women to stand up for what they believe in . " She not only reiterates her assertion of total originality , " professed pop critic Ann Powers , " but also finesses it until it 's both a philosophical stance about how constructing a persona from pop @-@ cultural sources can be an expression of a person 's truth — a la those drag queens Gaga sincerely admires — and a bit of a feminist act . " In summation of her videos , Rolling Stone used the rhetoric : " does anyone look to a Lady Gaga video for restraint ? " 
 Her performances are described as " highly entertaining and innovative " ; the blood @-@ spurting performance of " Paparazzi " at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was described as " eye @-@ popping " by MTV News . She continued the " blood soaked " theme during The Monster Ball Tour , and triggered protests in England from family groups and fans in the aftermath of a local tragedy , in which a taxi driver had murdered 12 people . Her <unk> continued at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards : appearing in drag as her male alter ego , Jo Calderone , and delivering a lovesick monologue before a performance of her song " You and I " . As Gaga 's choreographer and creative director , Laurieann Gibson provided material for her shows and videos for four years only to be replaced by Gibson 's assistant Richard Jackson . Gaga admits to being a perfectionist when it comes to her elaborate shows . " I 'm very bossy . I can scream my head off if I see one light fixture out . I 'm very detailed – every minute of the show has got to be perfect . " 
 = = Public image = = 
 Public reception of Gaga 's music , fashion sense and persona are polarized . Her status as a role model , self @-@ esteem booster for her fans , trailblazer , and fashion icon who breathes new life into the industry is by turns affirmed and denied . Critics have pointed out her unique place in pop music , the need for new movements in popular culture , the attention Gaga brings to modern social issues , and the inherently subjective nature of her art . In view of her influence on modern culture and her rise to global fame , sociologist Mathieu <unk> of the University of South Carolina has offered a course titled " Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame " since spring 2011 with the objective of unravelling : " some of the sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga . " When Gaga briefly met with US president Barack Obama at a Human Rights Campaign fundraiser , he described the interaction as " intimidating " as she was dressed in 16 @-@ inch heels making her undoubtedly the tallest woman in the room . 
 Towards the end of 2008 , comparisons were made between the fashions of Gaga and Aguilera , that noted similarities in their styling , hair , and make @-@ up . Aguilera stated that she was " completely unaware of [ Gaga ] " . Comparisons continued into 2010 , when Aguilera released the music video of her single " Not Myself Tonight " . Critics noted similarities between the song and its accompanying music video and Gaga 's video for " Bad Romance " . When interviewed by Barbara Walters for her annual ABC News special 10 Most Fascinating People in 2009 , Gaga dismissed the claim that she is intersex as an urban legend . Responding to a question on this issue , she stated , " At first it was very strange and everyone sorta said , ' That 's really quite a story ! ' But in a sense , I portray myself in a very androgynous way , and I love androgyny . " 
 Gaga 's outlandish fashion sense has also been one of her characteristic aspects . The Global Language Monitor named " Lady Gaga " as the Top Fashion <unk> with her trademark " no pants " a close third . Entertainment Weekly put her outfits on its end of the decade " best @-@ of " list , saying : " Whether it 's a dress made of Muppets or strategically placed bubbles , Gaga 's outré ensembles brought performance art into the mainstream . " Time placed Gaga on their All @-@ Time 100 Fashion Icons List amongst some of Gaga 's inspirations such as Michael Jackson , Madonna , and The Beatles , stating : " Lady Gaga is just as notorious for her outrageous style as she is for her pop hits . After all , Gaga , born Stefani Germanotta , has sported outfits made from plastic bubbles , Kermit the Frog dolls , and raw meat . " 
 Gaga wore a dress made of raw beef to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards which was supplemented by boots , a purse , and a hat also made out of raw beef . Partly awarded in recognition of the dress , Vogue named her one of the Best Dressed people of 2010 while Time named the dress the Fashion Statement of 2010 . However , it promted divided opinions , attracting the attention of worldwide media but also invoking the fury of animal rights organization PETA . In 2012 , Gaga became a feature of a temporary exhibition The Elevated : From the Pharaoh to Lady Gaga marking the 150th anniversary of the National Museum in Warsaw . Gaga was presented in a dress of raw meat , described by Polish weekly <unk> as : " an icon of modernity elevated by the power which she exercises over mass media " . The meat dress was later displayed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts , and entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 2015 . As Gaga appeared at the 87th Academy Awards and subsequent events , she changed her style and fashion , transforming into a more glamorous person ; Vogue compared her to that of Marilyn Monroe and MTV News described the change as " more acceptably ' natural ' or ' classic ' " . 
 While devout followers call Gaga " Mother Monster " , Gaga often refers to her fans as " Little Monsters " which she had tattooed on herself in dedication . To some , this dichotomy contravenes the concept of outsider culture . Camille Paglia , in her 2010 cover story " Lady Gaga and the death of sex " in The Sunday Times , asserts that Gaga : " is more an identity thief than an erotic taboo breaker , a mainstream manufactured product who claims to be singing for the freaks , the rebellious and the dispossessed when she is none of those . " Writing for The Guardian , Kitty Empire opined that the dichotomy : " ... allows the viewer to have a ' transgressive ' experience without being required to think . At [ her performance 's ] core , though , is the idea that Gaga is at one with the freaks and outcasts . " In July 2012 , Gaga also co @-@ founded the website <unk> with Silicon Valley entrepreneur Joseph <unk> , which became the first official social network devoted to fans of an artist .

In June of the same year , she performed at the San Francisco Pride event . After The Fame was released , she revealed that the song " Poker Face " was about her bisexuality . In an interview with Rolling Stone , she spoke about how her boyfriends tended to react to her bisexuality , saying : " The fact that I 'm into women , they 're all intimidated by it . It makes them uncomfortable . They 're like , ' I don 't need to have a threesome . I 'm happy with just you ' . " When she appeared as a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in May 2009 , she praised DeGeneres for being : " an inspiration for women and for the gay community " .

 = Flag of Bhutan = 
 The national flag of Bhutan ( Dzongkha : <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ་ ; Wylie : <unk> @-@ ran @-@ sa @-@ kyi dar @-@ cho ) is one of the national symbols of Bhutan . The flag is based upon the tradition of the Drukpa Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism and features Druk , the Thunder Dragon of Bhutanese mythology . The basic design of the flag by <unk> <unk> <unk> Dorji dates to 1947 . A version was displayed in 1949 at the signing of the Indo @-@ Bhutan Treaty . A second version was introduced in 1956 for the visit of Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuk to eastern Bhutan ; it was based upon photos of its 1949 predecessor and featured a white Druk in place of the green original . 
 The Bhutanese subsequently redesigned their flag to match the measurements of the flag of India , which they believed fluttered better than their own . Other modifications such as changing the red background color to orange led to the current national flag , in use since 1969 . The National Assembly of Bhutan codified a code of conduct in 1972 to formalize the flag 's design and establish protocol regarding acceptable flag sizes and conditions for flying the flag . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Historically Bhutan is known by numerous names , but the Bhutanese call the country Druk after the name of the Bhutanese thunder dragon . This tradition dates to 1189 when Tsangpa Gyare Yeshe Dorje , founder of the Drukpa lineage of Tibetan Buddhism , was in <unk> ( Tibet ) where he reportedly witnessed the <unk> valley glowing with rainbow and light . Considering this an auspicious sign , he entered the valley to choose a site for the construction of a monastery , whereupon he heard three peals of thunder – a sound produced by the druk ( dragon ) according to popular Bhutanese belief . The monastery that Tsangpa Gyare built that year was named Druk Sewa <unk> , and his school of teaching became known as Druk . The Druk school later split into three lineages . One of these three , Drukpa , was founded by Tsangpa Gyare 's nephew and spiritual heir <unk> Dharma <unk> and afterward spread throughout Bhutan . The nation itself would also later become known as Druk . This legend offers one explanation for how the symbolism of the dragon came to form the basis of the national flag of Bhutan . An alternative hypothesis maintains that the notion of symbolizing sovereign and state in the form of a dragon emerged in neighboring China and was adopted by the rulers of Bhutan as a symbol of royalty in the early 20th century .

 = = = Design = = = 
 The current flag is divided diagonally from the lower hoist @-@ side corner , with the upper triangle yellow and the lower triangle orange . Centred along the dividing line is a large black and white dragon facing away from the hoist side . The dragon is holding a <unk> , or jewel , in each of its claws . The background colours of the flag , yellow and orange , are identified as Pantone 116 and 165 respectively . Equivalents of these shades and the white of the Druk are specified by various other codes according to particular matching systems as indicated below . 
 The dimensions of the flag must maintain a 3 : 2 ratio . The following sizes have been declared standard by the Government of Bhutan : 
 21 ft × 14 ft ( 6 @.@ 4 m × 4 @.@ 3 m ) 
 12 ft × 8 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 m × 2 @.@ 4 m ) 
 6 ft × 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m × 1 @.@ 2 m )

 According to The Legal Provisions of the National Flag of the Kingdom of Palden Drukpa as Endorsed in Resolution 28 of the 36th Session of the National Assembly held on June 8 , 1972 , and as restated in the Constitution of 2008 , the yellow signifies civil tradition and temporal authority as embodied in the Druk Gyalpo , the Dragon King of Bhutan , whose royal garb traditionally includes a yellow <unk> ( scarf ) . The orange half signifies Buddhist spiritual tradition , particularly the Drukpa Kagyu and Nyingma schools . Druk , the Thunder Dragon , spreads equally over the line between the colors . The placement of Druk in the center of the flag over the dividing line between the flag 's two colors signifies the equal importance of both civic and monastic traditions in the Kingdom of Druk ( Bhutan ) and evokes the strength of the sacred bond between sovereign and people . The white color of Druk signifies the purity of inner thoughts and deeds that unite all the ethnically and linguistically diverse peoples of Bhutan . The jewels held in Druk 's claws represent Bhutan 's wealth and the security and protection of its people , while the dragon 's snarling mouth symbolizes Bhutanese deities ' commitment to the defense of Bhutan . 
 = = Historic evolution = = 
 The Centre for Bhutan Studies , an independent Bhutanese research centre , in 2002 issued a paper ( henceforth the " CBS document " ) that is the only readily available account from Bhutan of the historical development of the national flag . The document draws heavily on first @-@ hand accounts obtained through interviews with individuals personally involved in the creation and modification of the flag in Bhutan , from the late 1940s until the adoption of the current flag around 1970 . This report is therefore a significant primary source for information about the history of the Bhutanese flag . But in the description of the flag from 1949 , the document is not in complete accord with photos of the flag ( as discussed below ) , making it difficult to interpret some of the document 's assertions . As a record , however , of the few primary sources remaining – namely , the people involved in the flag 's history and the handful of existing government records – it represents a valuable source of information about the otherwise poorly documented evolution of the Bhutanese flag . 
 = = = First national flag ( 1949 ) = = = 
 The CBS document states that the first national flag was designed upon the request of Jigme Wangchuk , the second Druk Gyalpo of the 20th @-@ century Kingdom of Bhutan , and was introduced in 1949 during the signing of the Indo @-@ Bhutan Treaty . While the document does not provide an illustration of the original design , black @-@ and @-@ white photographs taken at this historic event provide images of the first Bhutanese flag at the ceremony . 
 The design of the flag is credited to <unk> <unk> <unk> Dorji in 1947 . <unk> Taw Taw , one of the few painters available to the royal court at the time , is said to have embroidered the flag . Druk was colored green in accordance with traditional and religious references to yu druk <unk> ( Dzongkha : <unk> ་ <unk> ་ <unk> ) , or " turquoise druk . " Today , a modern reproduction of this historic original ( with several significant changes influenced by the modern flag ) is displayed behind the throne in the National Assembly Hall in Thimphu . 
 According to the CBS document , the original Bhutanese flag was a bicolour square flag divided diagonally from the lower hoist to the upper fly . The field of yellow extended from the hoist to the upper fly , and the red field extended from the fly end to the lower hoist . In the centre of the flag , at the convergence of the yellow and red fields , is a green Druk , located parallel to the bottom edge and facing the fly . 
 However , the CBS document does not illustrate the early versions of the flag and its description of the 1949 flag is not entirely consistent with the photos surviving from 1949 . It describes the flag as " square " , while the proportions of the flag in the photographs appear closer to 4 : 5 . The document describes the dragon as " facing the fly end " , while the dragon visible in the photos faces the hoist . The dragon is described as " parallel to the fly " ( meaning , according to a diagram in the document , parallel to the length along the bottom edge of the flag ) , while the dragon in the photos appears to have a slightly rising vertical slant . The dragon is described as " green " , but the shade in the photos , if indeed green , must be very pale . 
 Western flag books until after 1970 generally show the Bhutanese flag closely resembling the 1949 photos . 
 = = = Changes in 1956 = = = 
 The second version of the national flag was developed in 1956 for the visit of the third Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuk to eastern Bhutan . During the trip the Druk Gyalpo 's Secretariat began to use flags of a new design based upon a photograph of the first national flag of 1949 , with the colour of the dragon changed from green to white . The retinue of the Druk Gyalpo included a convoy consisting of over one hundred ponies ; a small version of the flag was placed on the saddle of every tenth pony , and a large flag approximately 6 square feet ( 0 @.@ 56 m2 ) in size was flown in the camp every evening , hoisted to the sound of a bugle .

 Beginning in the late 1950s , <unk> <unk> Lam , former Secretary to Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and Sixth Speaker of the National Assembly ( 1971 – 74 ) , was requested by the king to make several modifications to the flag ; he is responsible for its current design , which has remained unchanged since 1969 . The king was reportedly dissatisfied that the early square Bhutanese flags did not flutter like the rectangular Indian flag displayed on the visit of an Indian official to the country . The standard measurements of the flag of Bhutan were thereafter altered to resemble the flag of India , which was 9 feet by 6 feet . 
 In another change , the dragon , which had formerly been placed in a roughly horizontal position in the center of the flag , was repositioned to spread out over the diagonal dividing line between the background colours . This change sought to avoid having the dragon " face the earth " when the flag was hanging limp . Bhutanese artist <unk> Lopen Jada painted a new design for the druk in which the curves of the dragon 's body are relaxed to create a somewhat longer and more gently undulating shape . 
 The CBS document states that the king ordered the colour of the lower half changed from red to orange " sometime in 1968 or 69 . " 
 The Bhutanese flag was flown abroad beside another nation 's flag for the first time in 1961 during a state visit to India by Jigme Dorji Wangchuck . This visit inaugurated a new level of relations between the two countries . 
 = = Code of conduct = = 
 On 8 June 1972 the National Assembly of Bhutan approved Resolution 28 , bringing into effect National Flag Rules drafted by the Cabinet . The rules have eight provisions covering the description and symbolism of the flag 's colouring , fields and design elements . Other rules relate to the size of the flag as well as flag protocol including the appropriate places and occasions for flying the flag and who may display the flag on cars . In general , the flag is given as much respect as the Bhutanese state and the head of state . As in the United States Flag Code , no other flags must be placed higher than the Bhutanese flag , the flag cannot be used as a cover or drape ( with some exceptions ) and the flag must not touch the ground . Other provisions include prohibitions on including the design in other objects or in a logo . Exceptionally , the flag may be used to drape coffins , but only those of high @-@ ranking state officials such as ministers or military personnel . 
 The 1972 rules also provide that " every dzongkhag [ district headquarters ] will hoist the national flag . Where there are no dzongkhag , the national flag will be hoisted in front of the office of the main government officer . " 
 Officials above the rank of minister are allowed to fly the flag at their residence provided they do not live near the capital . The tradition of flying the national flag in front of government offices had not existed in Bhutan prior to 1968 but was decreed standard practice by the Druk Gyalpo after his Secretariat was moved from the city of Taba to <unk> Dzong in that year . The only flag day prescribed in the 1972 rules is National Day , which is held annually on December 17 . National Day commemorates the crowning of Ugyen Wangchuck as the first king of Bhutan on December 17 , 1907 . 
 = Meat ( Torchwood ) = 
 " Meat " is the fourth episode of the second series of British science fiction television series Torchwood , which was first broadcast by BBC Two on 6 February 2008 . It was written by Catherine Tregenna , who had previously written episodes for the first series of the show , directed by Colin Teague and produced by Richard Stokes and Chris Chibnall . The episode featured the five initial series regulars John Barrowman , Eve Myles , Burn Gorman , Naoko Mori and Gareth David Lloyd plus recurring actor Kai Owen in a central role . 
 Torchwood initially depicts a small team of alien @-@ hunters known as Torchwood Three , based in the Welsh city of Cardiff . In the premiere episode of the first series Gwen Cooper ( Eve Myles ) is introduced as a newcomer to the organisation who keeps her job secret from boyfriend Rhys Williams ( Kai Owen ) . The episode " Meat " depicts the two aspects of Gwen 's double life coming into conflict as Rhys finds himself caught up in Torchwood 's investigation into a corrupt meat trade stemming from human exploitation of a stranded benevolent alien . Rhys helps Torchwood in their attempts to apprehend the human villains of the episode and his bravery makes Gwen realise that she should no longer keep secrets from him . 
 The episode was filmed in and around Cardiff between June and July 2007 as part of the second production block of the series . The production team used the episode to expand Rhys ' role in the series , due to their appreciation of actor Kai Owen 's performances in the first series and the contention of executive producer Russell T Davies that the character should be seen as less of a " sap " in the second series . The alien " space whale " seen in the episode was created using computer @-@ generated imagery , with the exception of a cut section wound where the humans had been carving meat from . Tregenna characterised the monster as resembling " a giant kebab " . A more elaborate design was previously considered , but both Tregenna and Davies felt that this would detract from the alien 's suitability to the plot . 
 According to consolidated figures the episode was watched by 3 @.@ 28 million viewers on its BBC two debut , aggregated to 4 @.@ 74 million viewers after taking into consideration two repeat broadcasts the same week . Reviews of the episode ranged from mostly negative to very positive . Most commentators praised the larger role of Rhys in the episode , the performance of actor Kai Owen and the realism of the acting and dialogue overall . However , a large proportion of reviewers criticised the special effects used to create the alien and it was subsequently compared by some to resembling a sock puppet or hand puppet . Whilst some reviewers identified with the plight of the alien , others felt that its poor realisation meant that it was hard to feel any sympathy for it .

 = = = Background = = = 
 The central premise of the first two series of Torchwood is focused on a team of alien investigators known as Torchwood Three tracking down alien life which arrives in Cardiff via a space @-@ time rift located in the city . Gwen Cooper ( Eve Myles ) , a South Wales Police officer , is recruited into the organisation by its leader , Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) , in the premiere episode but due to the pressures of her work keeps it a secret from her boyfriend , trucking manager , Rhys ( Kai Owen ) . He believes reports of alien sightings to be a result of hallucinations induced by psychotropic drugs in the water supply and Gwen 's job to be working in " special ops " . By the second series Gwen is the second in command of Torchwood Three and now engaged to Rhys , who still remains in the dark regarding her vocation . 
 = = = Events = = = 
 Rhys is out driving when he is telephoned by his secretary Ruth ( Patti Clare ) , who informs him that one of their firm 's lorry drivers has crashed . At the crash Rhys discovers that one of his employees and friends has died whilst transporting meat to an abattoir . As he contemplates moving the lorry , a police officer ( Colin Baxter ) tells him that there is something suspicious in the back and that Torchwood want to investigate . The secret alien response team appears on the scene and Rhys spots his fiancée Gwen amongst them . The Torchwood team confiscate the meat that the lorry was transporting , due to suspicions that it originates from an alien . Gwen recognises the lorry as one from Harwood 's — Rhys ' firm . Back at their base of operations , known as the Hub , the team briefly consider that Rhys may be involved with the alien meat . Toshiko Sato ( Naoko Mori ) rings Rhys ' office for information , pretending to be the police . Meanwhile , analysing a sample of the meat , Torchwood 's resident medic Owen Harper ( Burn Gorman ) conjectures that it is being used for human consumption . Rhys texts Gwen asking for her to come home . He attempts to get her to confess to being at the crash site by questioning her on the police response to the lorry crash , but she is evasive . 
 After following Gwen from home , Rhys sees her meeting up with her boss Jack Harkness near the invisible lift in Roald Dahl Plass and follows them to a warehouse on the outskirts of Cardiff . While there he is captured by a group of men ( Garry Lake , Gerard Carey and Matt Ryan ) and subsequently taken inside the warehouse . Jack and Gwen see this and mistake his actions for collaboration . When questioned by his captors Rhys informs them of his colleagues death and in an act of self @-@ preservation claims to have destroyed the meat sample and offers to assume his colleagues job in trafficking the alien meat . The men subsequently show Rhys that they have captured a live " space whale " ( nicknamed the " cash cow " by its captors ) which is the source of the meat and which continues to grow despite them cutting chunks of its flesh away while it is still alive . Back at their flat , Rhys and Gwen argue over his presence at the warehouse and her presence at the lorry crash . Rhys suspects Gwen of infidelity with Jack . After their argument escalates , she is forced to confess that she catches aliens for a living . Rhys is initially disbelieving , and demands that she proves it . In response she takes him to the Hub . After recounting his findings and discussing the situation , Rhys agrees to help Torchwood investigate the warehouse . 
 As Rhys is expected by the alien 's captors , the team hides in his van as he drives them to the factory where the team sneaks in . They locate the creature and plan to stun the men and sedate it so they can move it back to the Hub until the Cardiff space @-@ time Rift reopens so they can send it back . They confirm that the creature is sentient , and experience empathy over its plight . The presence of Torchwood is discovered , Rhys is handcuffed by the three men . During the ensuing confrontation Rhys breaks free and takes a bullet for Gwen . Torchwood are able to stun the men and feed them amnesia pills . The creature becomes distressed and Owen can see no other option but to reluctantly euthanise it as it poses a threat to them by struggling . Back at the Hub , Owen patches up Rhys ' wound and Jack orders Gwen to give Rhys a pill too . After realising that Rhys is willing to support her life with Torchwood and that she enjoys being honest with him , Gwen cannot bring herself to do so . Jack relents , disappointed about this but unwilling to fire Gwen and face losing her from the team .

 " Meat " was made alongside " Sleeper " , the second episode of the series which was also directed by Teague , as part of block two of production which ran from 3 June to 5 July 2007 . It originally had the working title " Another Working Day " . In discussing the origins of the central alien writer Catherine Tregenna states that " we were just throwing ideas around and true to form Russell [ T Davies ] said " why isn 't it just a great big whale in a warehouse ? " " Davies states the alien was designed to be " one of Torchwood and Doctor Who 's biggest monsters " not in terms of concept but its " literal size " . He felt this provided insight into " the strangeness of life " . Producer Richard Stokes states that the concept design team created an idea of what they envisaged the whale to look like . Tregenna felt that the original design for the creature was " a little fanciful " in that it was a bit too " beautiful and exotic " before deciding " if it looked like that they [ the villains ] would exhibit it , it would be a freak show . " She characterises the final design as resembling " a giant kebab " . Contrary to observations from commentators , Tregenna did not intend the story to promote vegetarianism as she is not a vegetarian — she simply wanted to write an episode that was more action based than her series one episodes ( " Out of Time " and " Captain Jack Harkness " ) . The hypothetical size of the space whale resulted in Teague having to find this " huge great warehouse " and hire a fifty @-@ foot crane for camera angles . Whilst the main body of the alien was created using computer @-@ generated imagery a prosthetic version of the cut wound in the side of the alien was available for the actors to interact with on set . Actor Eve Myles describes it as being like filming within a " blood soaked , soppy big sponge " . The opening of the creature 's eye was created using green screen . Owen felt having to react to this to be the most unusual acting experience he 'd had whilst filming Torchwood . 
 In regards to the relationship between Gwen and Rhys , Davies felt that the episode provided a " rite of passage for the couple " . Director Colin Teague remarked that the character of Rhys " puts up with a lot from his wife to be . " The production team had previously planned to kill the character off at the end of the previous series but retained the character , partly because they liked Owen as an actor . In storylining the second series Davies states that " one of the first decisions we made was that we can 't make this guy look like a sap any longer . He 's got to be made aware of what 's going on . " Tregenna identified one of the central themes of the episode as the " love triangle between Gwen , Rhys and Jack " . The argument in which Gwen ultimately reveals to Rhys that she catches aliens for a living was partly improvised by Owen and Myles . The denouement of the episode sees the character of Rhys take a bullet to protect Gwen . To create this scene Owen 's clothing was fitted with a minor explosive , the gunshot effect " [ nipped ] a bit " which both Teague and Owen felt helped with the timing of the actor 's reaction . Location filming for the episode took place around Roald Dahl Plass on 3 July for several scenes , including the final scene with Gwen and Rhys on Mermaid Quay , and the earlier scene where Rhys observes Jack and Gwen by the water fountain . A warehouse near Roath Dock , Cardiff Bay was used as the location for the abandoned warehouse @-@ meat processing plant , whilst the Imperial Park Bypass was used for some of the road scenes . During the episode Gwen asks " What is this , Scooby @-@ Doo ? " in regards to Rhys ' suggestion the team hide in his van in order to carry out a sting operation . Torchwood Magazine suggest that this was a knowing reference from Tregenna to the critic and satirist Charlie Brooker 's reaction to the first series of the show .

 = = = Reception = = = 
 Previewing the episode as one of his TV choices for the day , The Guardian 's Gareth McClean stated that amongst " the snarling , shouting and awful , contrived sexual tension between Captain Pratt and the team , there 's an interesting idea here — the consequences of leading a double life . " He described Gwen as " the moral centre of the show " and joked that her " nice @-@ but @-@ dim boyfriend " must be the last person in Cardiff not to know of Torchwood 's existence . He concluded by stating " that a giant telepathic alien manatee is involved should by no means discourage viewing . " The Daily Mirror 's Jane Simon also selected the episode as her single pick of the day , praising scenes where Rhys and Torchwood formulate their infiltration plan as containing " the kind of sharp , sarcastic banter that made Buffy such fun to watch " . However , she felt that it was a " shame they can 't keep it up for the entire episode . " Ben Rawson @-@ Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode four out of five stars , feeling it to be a " juicy treat to devour , combining heightened drama , genuine emotion and nice touches of humour . " He praised the decision to foreground the character of Rhys , the contrast he provided to the operations of the Torchwood team and the realism of the arguments between him and Gwen . He also felt that the episode 's " eco @-@ friendly plot " made it easy to sympathise with the alien space whale stating " the emotive howls of pain , big puppy @-@ dog eyes and heartfelt score all [ combined ] to test the tear ducts . " However , he criticised the human antagonists for being " two @-@ dimensional plot functions rather than humans " and pointed out the " moral black hole " of Torchwood continuing to buy meat products despite condemning the plight of the space whale . Richard Edwards of SFX magazine also gave the episode four stars , feeling it highlighted how the " series has evolved " in that " the in @-@ fighting and gratuitous swearing have been replaced with slick dialogue that sizzles with humour and drama – not to mention a team that feels like a properly cohesive unit . " He also praised the increased role of Rhys and opined that the episode made the relationship between him and Gwen " the show 's most believable . " However , he felt that Jack , as the leader of a top secret organisation , should have pressed harder to have Rhys ' memory wiped . 
 Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha gave the episode a mixed review . He felt it was refreshing to have a story about aliens that weren 't invading and opined that " the brutal scenes at the abattoir and the whale @-@ like moans of agony from the beast tug on a few heartstrings . " However , he criticised the realisation of the alien describing it as " basically a giant , moaning turd sitting in the middle of a warehouse " and " a large lump of putty with eyes " . He felt that the episode gave Rhys " a chance to step into the spotlight for a change and prove he has what it takes to carry a story " and felt his reaction to the existence of aliens to be " perhaps the most realistic that the genre has produced " . Despite this , he felt that Rhys finding out about Torchwood put an end to the " fun " of Gwen " keeping secrets and concealing her double life " and expressed disappointment that Jack didn 't wipe his memory at the end of the episode . Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7 @.@ 6 on a one to ten scale and felt it provided a " messy , odd and somewhat unsettling twist on alien encounters " but felt the episode had several weak points . He felt it was hard not to see Rhys as " a buffoon " and questioned why Torchwood would use a civilian during a sting operation . He also felt that it pushed " beyond the limits of its capacity to create convincing special effects " and the creature itself looked like " a hand puppet " . Andrew Mickel of Den of Geek felt that Rhys has always been the " Welsh heart of the show " and praised his role in the episode for being " actually rather entertaining , approaching everything with invigorating gusto . " However he also criticised the denouement of the episode for being " <unk> mawkish " and opined that " it ’ s always impossible to care about CGI characters " . 
 Jason Hughes of AOL TV felt the creature to look like a " sock puppet when it was loose and flailing about angrily " and felt this to be " almost like a nod to old Doctor Who , which had awesomely awful special effects at times " . He also felt that Rhys becoming aware of Torchwood " adds a new and interesting dynamic to the show . " Stephen Frank , writing for the gay and bisexual male entertainment site AfterElton indicated that he was " all in favour " of getting " to know our favorite Cardiff cuckold [ Rhys ] a little bit better " . Though critical of Gwen 's characterisation in previous episodes , he praised her defense of Rhys ' memories at the end of the episode as her " finest moment on this show " and stated that it " helps rehabilitate her " . He stated overall that " Meat " had " performed something of a minor miracle in the way it ’ s made me reassess my views of both Gwen and Rhys and their relationship . " Alasdair Stewart of Firefox News felt that Tregenna had written some of the strongest episodes of the series in the past and stated the episode " should be one of the highlights of the series " but " instead , it 's a mess " . He criticised the plausibility of the villains , the poor special effects of the alien and the incompetency of the Torchwood team , describing the episode as containing a " total lack of consistency " and " a total lack of basic understanding of what Torchwood are supposed to be capable of " . He felt Kai Owen provided " a bright spot in the episode " describing him as " clearly a powerhouse of an actor " and opining that " the scenes where he <unk> on first Eve Myles and then John Barrowman " also brought out " the best in both actors " . Conversely , io9 's Charlie Jane Anders felt the alien half of the episode to be " one of the best examples of a humans @-@ are @-@ the @-@ real @-@ monsters story ever " but felt that " the other half of the episode was Torchwood at its rock @-@ bottom worst " . She criticised the argument scenes stating : " I was having psychic chunks carved off me by a man in a yellow helmet , every time Gwen screamed at Rhys or Jack " and felt overall that the episode contained " too much screaming " . She enjoyed the innuendos made by Jack , but criticised the scene where Gwen stared " psycho @-@ <unk> " at him whilst kissing Rhys . 
 John Beresford of TV Scoop felt that " Meat " finally provided " a story that was well conceived , realised and paced " opining that at last " Torchwood came of age " and that it was " easily the best Torchwood story so far . " He did have some problems such as " really pathetic alien , the odd off @-@ colour innuendo about alien " meat " and the lazy convenience of the amnesia pills " but felt that these were relatively minor . The strongest points of the episode for him were the acting which he felt to be " uniformly better than usual and on occasion almost incandescent " and the dialogue which was " so natural it didn ’ t actually sound like " dialogue " at all " . Stephen James Walker , in his own analysis of the episode , gave a mostly favourable review . He criticised the alien space whale as the " one less @-@ than @-@ wonderful " aspect of the episode but praised the opening sequence and the use of the " bleak industrial setting " by director Colin Teague . He felt that the expanded role of Rhys was one of the most pleasing aspects of the scripts and praised the humorous interactions that constituted " male bonding " between him and Jack . He singled out a scene where Gwen turns " a gesture of affection " toward Rhys " into a teasing come @-@ on " to Jack by making eye @-@ contact with the latter whilst kissing the former as characteristic of the " moral ambiguity " which makes her " such a great character " . He also felt that whilst they did not have much to do , Tosh , Owen and Ianto had some good scenes which further demonstrated " Tregenna 's <unk> at handling the show 's regular characters " .

 Willy Vandersteen ( 15 February 1913 – 28 August 1990 ) was a Belgian creator of comic books . In a career spanning 50 years , he created a large studio and published more than 1 @,@ 000 comic albums in over 25 series , selling more than 200 million copies worldwide . 
 Considered together with Marc Sleen the founding father of Flemish comics , he is mainly popular in Belgium , the Netherlands and Germany . Hergé called him " The Brueghel of the comic strip " , while the creation of his own studio and the mass production and commercialization of his work turned him into " the Walt Disney of the Low Countries " . 
 Vandersteen is best known for Suske en Wiske ( published in English as Spike and Suzy , Luke and Lucy , Willy and Wanda or Bob and <unk> ) , which in 2008 sold 3 @.@ 5 million books . His other major series are De Rode Ridder with over 200 albums and Bessy ) with almost 1 @,@ 000 albums published in Germany .

 = = = 1913 – 1939 = = = 
 Willebrord Jan Frans Maria Vandersteen was born in Antwerp in 1913 . His family lived in the <unk> , a poor quarter of the city , where his father Francis Vandersteen worked as a decorator and stone sculptor . His studio lay next to a printer that produced De <unk> , one of the first weekly youth magazines in Flanders . Willy Vandersteen , only four years old , read the new magazine there every week , including <unk> , an early comic strip . His mother Anna Gerard was more interested in ballet and singing . One of her favourites , Wiske <unk> , may well have been the inspiration for the name " Wiske " he gave to one of the main characters in his main series " Spike and Suzy " . 
 Vandersteen was creatively active from his youth . He drew pictures with crayons on sidewalks , and invented stories for his friends about knights and legends . He even convinced his young friends to buy him crayons so he could depict the local cycling championship . At school as well , he was more interested in telling stories and learning about art than anything else . His best memory of these schooldays is of a teacher who introduced him to the works of Pieter Brueghel . Outside school , he spent most of his time with comic magazines and adventure books by Jules Verne or books about Nick Carter and Buffalo Bill . At 13 , he enrolled at the Academie voor <unk> Kunsten in Antwerp to study sculpture , and two years later he started working as sculptor and decorator , just like his father . 
 The same year , the family moved to Deurne , a suburb of Antwerp , where he came in contact with nature and with scouting , which both had a profound impact on his character and his later work . With the scouts , he became the troop reporter , writing down heavily illustrated reports on their outings and adventures , in a similar vein as what Hergé did in his scouting period . Through the scouts , he also came into contact with Le Boy @-@ Scout Belge , the Walloon scouting magazine where Hergé made Totor , his first published comic . Vandersteen made a few sequels to these adventures for his friends as amusement , which are the earliest preserved comics he made . He continued to follow the work of Hergé later on . Meanwhile , Vandersteen combined his studies at the Academy with his work in his father 's workshop until 1935 , when the market for stone decorations for houses collapsed . 
 In between some odd jobs , Vandersteen became an avid <unk> , from gymnastics over cycling to wrestling . His chances improved in 1936 when he was hired as a decorator for the shop and the display windows of L 'Innovation , a Belgian chain of supermarkets . In the same year , he met Paula Van Den Branden , whom he married on 9 October 1937 . After living in Antwerp for two years and having a daughter , Helena , in 1938 , the first of their four children , the couple moved to the more rural <unk> in 1939 . 
 While doing research for his decorations , he read in an American magazine the article Comics in your Life . Fascinated , Vandersteen searched for more information on the subject . He rediscovered Hergé with The Adventures of Tintin in Le Petit Vingtième , but also the realistic work of Hal Foster in Prince Valiant . But it took a few more years before this fascination translated into steady publication of his own comics . Meanwhile , his first published drawings appeared in Entre Nous , the internal magazine of L 'Innovation . 
 = = = 1940 – 1944 = = = 
 In March 1940 , two months before the start of World War II in Belgium , Bob , his second child , was born . When the first tribulations of the war were over , Vandersteen could restart his work at L 'Innovation . From November 1940 until August 1942 , he created his first published comic , Kitty Inno , for the company , consisting of short , simple gags . When the German occupier forbade the publication of American and British comics in the Belgian newspapers and magazines , <unk> arose for local people . On 19 March 1941 , the first comic strip of Tor de <unk> ( Tor the <unk> ) appeared in the newspaper De Dag . It continued until January 1942 . Already on 26 March 1941 it was joined by De <unk> <unk> van <unk> ( The funny adventures of <unk> ) , a weekly comic strip about a cat . This was in May of the same year replaced by <unk> , another comic about a cat , which ended in October 1941 . 
 In 1942 , Vandersteen quit his job at L 'Innovation and started working at the <unk> en <unk> ( a government organisation for the agricultural sector ) , where he illustrated some magazines . In those years , the family Vandersteen moved , this time to <unk> , another suburb of Antwerp . 
 That same year , he illustrated the pro @-@ occupation book <unk> zag Brussel de <unk> <unk> under the pen name <unk> . In the 1970s Willy denied rumors , based on drawing style , that he had been the real artist behind <unk> , but in 2010 these allegations were confirmed after an investigation demanded by his own family . Unlike his partners , Vandersteen was later not persecuted for his part in publishing the antisemitic drawings , which were considered collaboration with the Nazis . 
 At the <unk> , Vandersteen met a colleague whose wife worked at Bravo , a weekly Flemish comics magazine that appeared since 1936 and had a French @-@ language version since 1940 . Due to the war conditions , they were desperately in need of local artists to replace the American comics they used to publish . Led by established Walloon illustrator Jean <unk> , a young team was gathered , with artists like Edgar P. Jacobs and Jacques Laudy . Vandersteen joined in 1943 , and here his comics career really took off . First he created Tori , a reprise of the prehistoric Tor , and a few weeks later his new comic <unk> de <unk> ( <unk> the Sailor ) was published on the cover and in colour , a first for Vandersteen . 
 For the Antwerp publisher Ons Volk , he created three comics , published as books without a <unk> in a newspaper or magazine . <unk> , about the adventures of a wooden horse , became his first comic album in 1943 , and was followed by two sequels in 1944 and 1946 . Those comics were also published in French . For the same editor , he illustrated 11 children books . In the same years , he also created the cover illustration for a number of novels from other publishers . In 1944 , he also started working for two more magazines , De <unk> and De <unk> , where he created some comics and made numerous illustrations . To help him with all this work , his wife Paula inked many of his pencil drawings in these years . 
 = = = 1944 – 1949 = = = 
 After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944 , there was a boom of new magazines for the youth , both in French and Dutch . Many of those tried to mix American comics with local artists . Vandersteen worked in these early years for countless publications . He continued publishing in Bravo , with the medieval gags of Lancelot . Having moved to the suburbs of Brussels to avoid the bombardments of Antwerp , he came into contact with some French language editors . French language magazines he contributed to included Franc Jeu , Perce @-@ Neige , and Le Petit Monde . Two of the comics he created for Franc Jeu were also published in albums . By 1947 , all these magazines had disappeared . 
 Defining for his career was the invitation he got in 1944 from the people of Standaard <unk> , a chain of libraries who were also active as publishers . They were interested in his work and wanted to publish some books . Vandersteen presented them with the first designs for a daily comic strip , but they put that on hold and first ordered four juvenile books from Vandersteen . These were published in 1945 and 1946 in Dutch and French ( by Casterman ) . 
 On 30 March 1945 , the daily comic strip Rikki en Wiske started to appear in the newspaper De Nieuwe Standaard , after a positive review by the young illustrator Marc Sleen . It was an immediate success , and the first story ran uninterrupted until 15 December 1945 . Vandersteen though was disappointed to see the editor had renamed the strip Rikki en Wiske instead of his suggestion Suske en Wiske , and also felt that Rikki too closely resembled Tintin . 
 The next story , Rikki disappeared , and the long series of adventures of Suske en Wiske began with the story Op het <unk> <unk> , achieving success beyond the author 's expectations . The first album appeared in 1946 . This story introduced most of the recurring figures and means of transport through space and time , and set the framework for the complete series . Already in 1946 , it was also published in the Dutch newspaper De Stem . 
 On 22 December 1945 , three days after the start of Suske en Wiske op het <unk> <unk> , appeared the first page of De Familie Snoek ( The Family Snoek ) , a weekly series of gags revolving around a contemporary Flemish family . It lasted for 11 albums . 
 Apart from these two long lasting newspaper comic strips , Vandersteen made a number of other comics in these years . Most important was his work for Ons Volkske , the youth supplement of the weekly magazine Ons Volk , which from the end of 1945 on became an independent comic magazine . Marc Sleen was editor @-@ in @-@ chief and filled most pages together with Vandersteen . Vandersteen created a number of realistic stories of about 20 pages each , where he developed his own style after starting very much as a follower of Harold Foster . In his usual more <unk> style , he created in August 1946 the recurring <unk> De <unk> <unk> ( The Happy Rascals ) . More adult comics appeared in the magazine Ons Volk . 
 In 1947 , two publishers started a legal battle for the right to the names of the newspapers and magazines . Vandersteen , caught in the middle , worked a while for both , but eventually switched to the new owners of De Standaard . He continued to work for Ons Volkske , which was now renamed ' t <unk> for a few more months . The publishers of De Standaard also continued the album series of Suske en Wiske , which started modestly with one album in 1946 and one in 1947 . By 1947 , seven albums were available , and the first ones were already reprinted . The first albums of De Familie Snoek had also appeared by then . Supported by large publicity campaigns , they sold very well : the first Snoek album was in its third impression by 1948 . The popularity of Vandersteen , and the impact comics had in Flanders , is attested by the 25 @,@ 000 readers who switched to the Standaard at the same time as Vandersteen did . 
 Vandersteen worked the rest of his life for De Standaard , but contributed also to the other publications of the publisher : Ons Volkske , a new newspaper supplement continuing the name of the older magazine , and Het Nieuwsblad , the more popular newspaper of the group . Vandersteen made illustrations and comics when needed . For Ons Volk , which also reappeared , he made realistic stories until 1951 . 
 Vandersteen was now at the height of his productivity as a solo artist . Apart from his work for De Standaard and Het Nieuwsblad , he contributed to Ons Volk and Ons Volkske , he made a special Suske en Wiske story for het <unk> ( a weekly Christian newspaper ) , and he started to contribute to Kuifje journal ( Tintin magazine ) that published Hergé . The magazine was very popular in Wallonia , but struggled in Flanders , where The Adventures of Tintin was not yet as well known . A popular Flemish author would give the sales a boost , while it could mean the breakthrough on the French language market for Vandersteen . However , Hergé , as editor @-@ in @-@ chief , set a very high quality standard for his magazine , and Vandersteen had to improve and stylize his drawings , and had to remove the more Flemish , popular aspects of his comics . Vandersteen obliged , and the stories of Suske en Wiske he created for Kuifje are now considered the best of his career , with the first one , Het <unk> Spook ( The Spanish Ghost ) , which started on 16 September 1948 , as his masterpiece . It was because of his work for Kuifje that Hergé nicknamed Vandersteen " The Brueghel of the Comic Strip " . 
 = = = 1950s = = = 
 Vandersteen could no longer handle the work load on his own . In 1949 , he hired his first collaborator , François @-@ Joseph Herman . Herman stayed with Vandersteen only three years , but his tenure was the start of the large Studio Vandersteen , which has continued the series . He was followed by Karel <unk> in 1952 , who was an anonymous contributor until 1959 . He worked mainly for De <unk> van <unk> , a Suske en Wiske spin @-@ off Vandersteen created for the weekly newspaper De Bond , which ran from 24 January 1954 on . But he also inked many Suske en Wiske comics , including those in Tintin . Vandersteen devoted himself more and more towards the storytelling and the initial pencil drawing , which he considered the artistic process , while the inking was more of a craft . 
 The years from 1949 to 1953 are often considered the highlight of Vandersteen 's career , when he combined large production with consistent high quality in his stories , the jokes , the many characters , and the graphical aspects , in which the charming quirkiness of the early years was balanced with the more rigorous ligne claire of Hergé . Many of these stories were loosely based on popular classics , ranging from Alexandre Dumas over Buffalo Bill to Richard Wagner 's Der Ring des Nibelungen , with as culmination his comic in two parts of the legend of Till Eulenspiegel , made for Kuifje . 
 Vandersteen spent a lot more time at documentation from this point on . While the early comics were mostly filled by his imagination and visited imaginary countries or stayed close to home , he now started travelling to visit locations for new comics . Visits to Bruges , Monaco and Venice were the inspiration for three stories in Kuifje 
 In 1953 , when Tijl Uilenspiegel was finished , Vandersteen created a new comical strip for Kuifje . ' t <unk> told the humorous adventures of a young prince in a fictional country . It lasted until 1959 and ran for some 300 comics . 
 In 1951 , Vandersteen encountered Karel Verschuere , a young unemployed artist . Vandersteen hired him , and Verschuere soon became his mayor artist for the realistic series . His first series was Judi , a retelling of the Old Testament in four albums , which first appeared in Ons Volkske . The series was not very successful , and Verschuere later finished a fifth part on his own . Verschuere also contributed to the second part of Tijl Uilenspiegel , just like Bob de Moor and Tibet did , but his main contribution to the output of Vandersteen was his work on Bessy , a Western series inspired by the success of Lassie , which started in 1952 in the Walloon newspaper La Libre Belgique . The series appeared under the pseudonym <unk> , a combination of Willy and Karel , indicating the importance of <unk> 's work . He continued working with Vandersteen until 1967 , helping with many of the realistic series Vandersteen created in these years , including Karl May , Biggles and especially De Rode Ridder . 
 The success of Bessy , which from 1953 on also appeared in Dutch , led to the creation of the Studio Vandersteen , acknowledging , albeit mostly anonymously , that many of the comics were no longer made by Willy Vandersteen on his own . Together with the publications in Kuifje , it made Vandersteen a popular artist in Wallonia as well , and all Bessy and Suske en Wiske comics were published by <unk> in French . 
 = = = 1960s = = = 
 In 1966 , Vandersteen finally moved back from Brussels , where he had lived at different locations since World War II , towards Antwerp , and more precisely <unk> , a rural village to the north of Antwerp . There , next to his villa , he created the location for his main Studio . 
 The Bessy comics were also published in Felix , a German comic magazine by Bastei Verlag . From 1965 on , they wanted to publish a complete new story every month , a rhythm they increased to twice a month in 1966 . Unable to produce so fast , Vandersteen had to expand his Studio considerably . Led by Karel Verschuere , a team of some ten young artists mass @-@ produced the comics , which were of considerable lower quality . The most important of these artists were Frank Sels and Edgar <unk> , while many stories were produced by <unk> Janssens . When in late 1967 Verschuere quit , and at the same time Bastei increased the rhythm again , now to one complete comic a week , the Studio was disbanded and Sels and <unk> started to work on a free lance basis . The next year , they decided to go behind Vandersteen 's back and to sell directly to the Germans . Vandersteen then had to reorganize the Bessy Studio and hired Jeff <unk> . The Studio continued until 1985 , with artists like Patrick van <unk> , Ronald Van Riet , Eugeen Goossens , and Walter <unk> . It produced more than 900 Bessy @-@ comics . 
 Bastei Verlag , enamoured by the success of Bessy , asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series . With the popularity of superheroes , especially Batman , in Belgium and <unk> in these years , Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske , based on Jerom , the strongman of the series . Called <unk> in German , 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972 , with a publication that reached 150 @,@ 000 copies at its summit . The best of these stories were published in Dutch as well , just like it was done with the later Bessy 's , but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years . 
 The main artists in the Studio Vandersteen in the 1960s and later were Karel Verschuere , Frank Sels , Eduard De Rop , Eugeen Goossens , Karel Biddeloo and Paul Geerts . Eduard De Rop joined the Studio in 1959 , after Karel <unk> departed , and stayed for over thirty years . He worked mostly on minor series like Jerom and Pats , but contributed to almost all series , including Suske en Wiske . One of his main contributions was the early adventures of De Rode Ridder . De Rode Ridder was in 1946 created by writer Leopold <unk> , and published in books since 1954 , with illustrations by Karel Verschuere . The success led to the creation of a comics series as well , with as main contributors Verschuere , Eduard De Rop , and Vandersteen 's son Bob . De Rode Ridder became the third main success story of Vandersteen , and is now the longest running series behind Suske en Wiske . Karel Verschuere was replaced by Frank Sels in 1963 . 
 Karel Verschuere also started the series Karl May , based on the famous books , in 1962 . The contributions of Vandersteen to this and similar series like Biggles was minimal and consisted mainly of supervision and some first sketches . Frank Sels continued the series between 1963 and 1966 . 
 Vandersteen had to deliver a number of pages each week for the newspaper supplement Pats , increased to 16 pages in 1965 . Eduard De Rop revived De Familie Snoek with a new series of gags for a few years , and other series like Karl May were published here as well . The place of Karl May in the main newspaper was taken by Biggles , yet another realistic series started by Verschuere in 1965 . 
 When Frank Sels left the Studio in 1967 , Karel Biddeloo took over most of the realistic series of Vandersteen . He made Karl May from 1967 until 1969 , when the Bessy @-@ studio took over the job . He also took over Biggles , which ended in 1969 , when it was replaced by the jungle series Safari , inspired by Daktari . At the start of the series , Vandersteen did most of the creative work , but after a few albums he left most of the work to Biddeloo . The series ended in 1974 . Biddeloo then devoted most of his time to De Rode Ridder , where he started inking the stories by Vandersteen in 1967 and took completely over in 1969 , when Vandersteen lost his interest . He continued working on it until his death in 2004 . 
 = = = 1970s = = = 
 Paul Geerts joined the Studio in 1968 , where he at first worked as an artist on the German Jerom comics . Already in 1969 , he replaced De Rop as the main inker for Suske en Wiske . Geerts also drew <unk> attention when he proposed a few scenario 's for Jerom , and in 1971 he made his first story for Suske en Wiske . From 1972 on , he became the main creator of the flagship series Suske en Wiske , which he continued until the late 1990s . De Rop and Goossens again became the main inkers , with Geerts responsible for the stories and the pencil art . In these years , Suske en Wiske reached its peak popularity , and the older stories now were republished in colours in the main series . In 1975 and 1976 , the Dutch television broadcast six puppet movies with new Suske en Wiske stories . They were very successful and sales of new albums reached over 200 @,@ 000 copies . The merchandising business boomed as well , and commercial comics were one of the main new jobs for the Studio . 
 The Studio was mainly established with the artists that joined in the 1960s , but two new artists were Erik De Rop and Robert <unk> , who became the only artist to leave Studio Vandersteen and start his own successful series . 
 Vandersteen , liberated of the work on the daily comic , started on a comic series based on one of the novels he had read as a youth : Robert en Bertrand , the story of two Flemish tramps at the fin de siècle . The series debuted in De Standaard in 1972 . The series was the first in a long time to renew the enthusiasm of Vandersteen , and the graphical quality and the stories were a lot better than most of the Studio production of the time . 
 For the newspaper supplement Pats , he also created the title series in 1974 , but he left most of the work to <unk> . The series changed its name to Tits in 1977 after a lawsuit , and disappeared in 1986 . 
 In 1976 , Vandersteen 's wife Paula died . He remarried on 25 June 1977 with Anne @-@ Marie <unk> . Vandersteen , now a celebrated artist with complete TV shows made about him , both in the Netherlands and in Belgium , continued to work on his comics . The same year 1977 gave him a coveted Alfred award from the Angoulême International Comics Festival for the best scenario , for the Robert en Bertrand story De <unk> ( The Strike Breaker ) , while in 1978 a Suske en Wiske statue was unveiled in the Antwerp Zoo . 
 = = = 1980s = = = 
 The next decade was one of mixed successes . Some of the minor or less successful series ended : Robert en Bertrand , a critical but never a commercial success , folded in 1993 , 8 years after Vandersteen had stopped writing the stories . Jerom and Bessy both were restyled but disappeared a few years later in 1988 and 1993 . Pats , later renamed Tits , already disappeared in 1986 . 
 Suske en Wiske meanwhile was a steady success , and although the sales have dropped from the peaks of the 1970s continues to be one of the most popular Flemish comics . 
 Willy Vandersteen created one last new series in 1985 : De <unk> , a historical , humoristic comic set in Flanders in the sixteenth century . Similar in theme to the thirty years older Tijl Uilenspiegel , the comic combined many of Vandersteen 's passions , including the art of Pieter Brueghel the Elder . It contained his most mature , developed characters , compared to the often one @-@ dimensional characters of his earlier series , and reached a graphical level that approached his work for Kuifje . The comics were not <unk> and were mostly created by Vandersteen alone , which ensured the quality but also decreased the publication rhythm . Only ten albums appeared , and the series ended with the death of Vandersteen . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Willy Vandersteen died on 28 August 1990 , weakened by a long disease . He continued working until shortly before his death , and his Studio still continues , with Suske en Wiske and De Rode Ridder as main series . 
 = = Themes and influences in the work of Vandersteen = = 
 Willy Vandersteen used a wild variety of themes and influences in his work from early on . He made fairytales , historic series , westerns , but also science fiction and many contemporary comics . While some series like De Familie Snoek and Bessy stuck very close to their origin ( an everyday Flemish contemporary family for the former , and a pioneer family in the American Old West in the latter ) , others were more loose . De Rode Ridder , the story of a medieval knight , wandered from Arthurian tales over the crusades until the explorations of the fifteenth and sixteenth century , thereby spanning some ten centuries , and later ( when Vandersteen was less involved in the series ) brought in many elements of sword and sorcery and fantasy . 
 Suske and Wiske is a contemporary series , but many stories used the plot device of time travelling , either by a machine or by some poetic device . This enabled stories to evolve in a myriad of periods , often again in the Middle Ages though . Furthermore , did Vandersteen use local legends of Antwerp and Limburg , parodies of American superhero series like Batman , science fiction , and popular TV series . Vandersteen also got inspiration from the different long journeys he made , like his long trip to the Far East in 1959 . Some of the earliest realistic comics of Willy Vandersteen also clearly show the strong influence he has had from American comics like Prince Valiant and Tarzan , but he later developed his own distinctive style . 
 = = International success = = 
 Vandersteen always strived to have success beyond Flanders , and reduced the typically Flemish character of his comics soon after his debut . He already worked and published in French during the War , and already in the 1940s he expanded the reach of Suske en Wiske to the Netherlands with some newspaper publications , and to Wallonia and France through the publication in Tintin magazine . All Suske en Wiske albums , and many albums of other series like De Familie Snoek , were also published in French by <unk> . Bessy was even first created for a Walloon newspaper , before being translated in Dutch . By 1978 , an estimated 80 million Suske en Wiske albums had been sold in Dutch alone . 
 Other countries and languages followed soon . The first German translations appeared in 1954 , and in the 1960s Bessy and to a lesser extent Jerom were an enormous success , with combined over a 1000 weekly comics with a circulation of some 200 @,@ 000 copies . Later in the 1950s followed publications in Chile and Portugal , and Spain followed in the 1960s . In the following years , Vandersteen 's comics and especially Suske en Wiske are published in dozens of languages , but in most cases only one or a few albums are translated . More than 10 albums are published in the United States , and in Sweden 69 albums are published , accompanied by a lot of merchandising . The Finnish series is a big success as well . 
 = = Merchandising = = 
 In the 1950s started the merchandising around Suske en Wiske . Vandersteen , always a businessman as well as an artist , was enthusiastic when he got the proposal to make a puppet show of the series . Already in 1947 , the first puppets were for sale . They were followed by a series of 5 hand puppets in 1957 and a Jerom @-@ game in 1960 . In 1955 , two years after the start of television in Flanders , an animated adventure of Suske en Wiske was broadcast every Saturday afternoon . Other merchandising ranged from Suske en Wiske drinking glasses in 1954 to 5 large handpainted ceramic statues of the main heroes in 1952 . Coloring books , calendars , puzzles , ... followed <unk> records were released by Decca in 1956 . Vandersteen also created a number of commercial comics with Suske en Wiske , starting with a touristic comic for the province of Antwerp in 1957 .

 = Christine Love ( writer ) = 
 Christine Love is a Canadian independent visual novelist best known for her three original works : Digital : A Love Story , Don 't take it personally , babe , it just ain 't your story , and Analogue : A Hate Story . Love began creating visual novels while in university , making a few small games , visual novels , and pieces of written fiction before coming into prominence with the release of Digital in 2010 . She went on to work on Love and Order , a dating simulation by video game designer Riva Celso , as well as Don 't take it personally , both released in 2011 . Her latest work and first commercial project on which she was the primary developer is Analogue , released in February 2012 ; Love dropped out of her English degree during its development , and is currently fully supported financially on the proceeds . She released an expansion to the game , titled Hate Plus in 2013 . Her current project is called Ladykiller in a Bind , and is expected to be released in July 2016 . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Christine Love began creating visual novels while in school at Trent University . By January 2010 , she had made a few small video games , written a novel and a few short stories , which she largely unsuccessfully tried to sell , and had made a visual novel each March for three consecutive years for <unk> ( National Ren 'ai Game Writing Month ) , a month @-@ long contest in the vein of National Novel Writing Month ( <unk> ) where developers attempt to create a visual novel in one month . In February 2010 , she started a fourth visual novel , which resulted in Digital : A Love Story , her first game to receive widespread attention and acclaim . Set " five minutes into the future of 1988 " , Digital tells the story of the silent protagonist 's online relationship with a girl named * Emilia , and a mystery surrounding the " murders " of several AI programs . The game is presented entirely through the interface of a 1980s computer with online bulletin board system posts and messages from other characters ; the protagonist 's own messages are implied but never shown . Love expected the game to reach as many people as her prior work , " a dozen or so people " ; instead , the free game was noticed by video game publications and websites such as PC Gamer and Gamasutra and received much more attention , becoming what Love believes was " a defining point in [ her ] writing career " . Widely praised by critics , Digital earned an honorable mention in Gamasutra 's " Best Indie Games of 2010 " list . Love felt that Digital 's success turned her from a writer into an indie game developer . 
 After Digital , Love worked on her first commercial game project , Love and Order , a dating simulation by video game designer Riva Celso . She did writing and design work for the game , set in the Crown attorney 's office in Montreal , which was released in February 2011 . Love describes the game as " not really my best work " , as dating simulations are not her strong point . Nevertheless , proceeds from the game were enough to support her financially for a while , and showed Love that creating games and visual novels could be a full @-@ time profession . In 2011 , she spent the month of March working on another visual novel : don 't take it personally , babe , it just ain 't your story , which was released as a free download on 4 April 2011 . A spiritual sequel to Digital , the game follows John Rook , a private school literary teacher in 2027 , over the course of a semester . He can see students ' private messages at any time via the school 's social network . Don 't take it personally deals with themes of internet privacy and relationships in the future . The game was again widely praised by critics , with The Daily Telegraph awarding the game for " Best Script " in its video game awards of 2011 . 
 That summer , Love began working on a larger , commercial game . She was beginning to believe that her games could be successful commercially , a belief supported by messages to that effect by fans of her previous works . The game , Analogue : A Hate Story , was released in February 2012 . Love dropped out of university during the game 's development in her fourth year of an English undergraduate degree . She felt that she was " not really learning a whole lot " and was unable to balance school and work on the game . Set centuries after Digital : A Love Story , the plot of Analogue revolves around an unnamed investigator , who is tasked with discovering the reason for an interstellar ship 's disappearance once it reappears 600 years after " going dark " . The game 's themes focus similarly around human / computer interaction , interpersonal relationships , and LGBT issues ; but focus primarily on " transhumanism , traditional marriage , loneliness and cosplay . " The release of Analogue , Love 's first commercial game as main developer , currently fully supports her financially . Although Analogue is a sequel " of sorts " to Digital , the time difference between the two games means that they are connected more in spirit than directly , similar to the connections between Digital and Don 't take it personally . Analogue sold over 30 @,@ 000 copies by August 2012 , and has inspired the release of a soundtrack album by the game 's composer , Isaac Schankler , as well as a commercial expansion to the game , titled Hate Plus , which is intended to further develop the backstory of * Mute and the ship . 
 Since the release of Hate Plus , Love has begun work on a new game , titled Ladykiller in a Bind . The full name of the game is My Twin Brother Made Me <unk> As Him And Now I Have To Deal With A <unk> Stalker And A <unk> Beauty Who Want Me In A Bind ! ! , and the game is described by Love as " an erotic visual novel about social manipulation and girls tying up other girls " . 
 = = Influences and philosophy = = 
 Christine Love describes herself as " a writer first , and a game designer second " , as writing was her initial goal . She originally pictured her future as that of a novelist , with a day job as a programmer to support herself . Love describes her games as being about " our relationship with technology , about human relationships in general , and about seeing things from different perspectives , " as well as having " a ton of words " . She strives for her stories to be true and sincere , but not necessarily realistic . Love is also interested in the portrayal of gender and sexuality in video games ; in Digital and Analogue , she was careful to avoid mentioning or assuming the gender of the player or the character they control , though the love interests in the games are female . Privately , however , she thinks of them as female , as her intention was to create games that could be easily appreciated by queer people such as herself , without having to project themselves onto a relationship that did not match up to their perceptions . Love believes that indie games have " more meaningful depictions of queer experiences " than those from larger studios . 
 Love 's design process has become more refined as time goes on . For Digital , she did not plan anything in advance ; while for Analogue , she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting . For all of her games , however , she does a lot of research into the time periods and issues involved . Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way to tell a story in a game , but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer .

This episode sees alien entities test the Enterprise crew by observing their reactions to a deadly silicon @-@ based infection . Actual first contact with these aliens – the Organians – would occur about a century later , during the events of the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Errand of Mercy " . 
 As it was a bottle episode , the episode did not use any additional sets or guest stars with the intention of cutting down on costs for the series . This also gave time for the visual effects team to finish earlier work . The episode received mixed reactions from critics , with praise directed at the links to The Original Series , while criticism directed towards some of the characterization of the characters . " Observer Effect " was watched by 2 @.@ 76 million viewers on first broadcast , which formed part of an overall drop of viewers for the series .

 Lieutenant Reed ( Dominic Keating ) and Ensign Mayweather ( Anthony Montgomery ) play chess while serving as hosts to non @-@ corporeal aliens . Returning from an away mission on the planet below , Commander Tucker ( Connor Trinneer ) and Ensign Sato ( Linda Park ) soon exhibit symptoms of a strange disease . Upon examination by Doctor Phlox ( John Billingsley ) , it is found to be a highly contagious silicon @-@ based virus , and Captain Archer ( Scott Bakula ) explains that Commander T 'Pol ( Jolene Blalock ) and Phlox are seeking a cure . To pass the time , while isolated in Decontamination , the two try to learn more about each other . 
 The aliens take a keen interest examining the human response to this crisis , and compare notes to previous reactions by Klingons and Cardassians . They are members of an advanced species looking to make " first contact " . So far , based on 10 @,@ 000 years of observations , no species has been deemed ready . Seeking a different view of the crew , they temporarily shift to the bodies of Phlox , T 'Pol , and Archer . A difference in opinion between the two aliens starts to form : one seems determined to maintain their non @-@ interference protocol , while the other feels the protocol is outdated and unnecessary . 
 With time running out , Phlox and T 'Pol find a way to disrupt the virus using deadly levels of radiation . Archer and Phlox , while wearing environmental suits , escort Tucker and Sato to Sickbay for treatment . Sato soon goes into cardiac @-@ arrest , and Archer removes his gloves and helmet to assist her , but she cannot be resuscitated . They then administer a dose of radiation to Tucker , but that too is ineffective . Phlox then leaves to resume work from the Bridge . Suddenly , Tucker and Sato are reanimated by the aliens , who – while possessing the crewmen – explain the situation to a surprised Archer , who then makes an impassioned speech on behalf of his crew . The aliens decide to modify their procedures , choosing to resurrect and cure the infected crew members , when they previously would have left them to die . The aliens erase the encounter from crew 's memory . Archer orders a warning beacon to be placed above the planet , and the aliens leave to begin planning first contact with more advanced humans at a later time . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Observer Effect " was created as a bottle episode , the second in a row after " Daedalus " . These episodes were intended to reduce costs on the series by not requiring additional set production . Unlike the " Daedalus " , " Observer Effect " also did not use any guest actors . It was the second to be written by Judith and Garfield Reeves @-@ Stevens , who wrote a plot which brought back the Organians from the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Errand of Mercy " . The Organians were originally created for The Original Series by Gene L. Coon , and were intended as a balance to the Klingons . Mind replacement or mind invasion plotlines are common in science fiction . Other episodes in the Star Trek franchise exploring the theme include " Wolf in the Fold " and " Turnabout Intruder " from The Original Series , " Sub Rosa " from Star Trek : The Next Generation and " Cathexis " from Star Trek : Voyager . 
 This was one of show runner Manny Coto 's deliberate moves to link Enterprise closer to The Original Series during the fourth season . It was the second time that the crew of the Enterprise ( NX @-@ 01 ) had met non @-@ corporal entities following the second season episode " The Crossing " . Filming began on the episode on October 22 , 2004 , and continued for the following seven working days . While the makeup department needed to present Park 's and Trinneer 's characters as they progressed through the sickness introduced by the Organians , the visual effects team was freed up to complete production on earlier episodes .

 Jamahl Epsicokhan , at his website Jammer 's Reviews , described the plot of " Observer Effect " as not being as predictable as it might initially seem due to the crew 's inability to save Tucker and Hoshi and their reliance on the aliens to do so . He felt that the links to " Errand of Mercy " were both " subtle " and " sublime " , while describing the overall bottle show as " No slam @-@ bang excitement ; just a commitment to observation and plausible procedure . " He adds that the episode was an example of " humanist science fiction " rather than an " adventure show " . 
 Michelle Erica Green disliked the episode , writing about it in a review for TrekNation . She called it " clichéd , predictable and boring " , saying that the sudden differences in characterization in this episode , compared to how those characters acted in earlier appearances , could potentially lead to confusion as to when they were actually controlled by the aliens . She criticized the plot which only affected the senior crew members on the ship and said that it had " ripped off " several prior episodes of the franchise including " The <unk> " , " Homeward " and " Scientific Method " . 
 " Observer Effect " was released on home media in the United States on November 1 , 2005 , as part of the season four DVD box set of Enterprise . The Blu @-@ ray edition was released on April 1 , 2014 . 
 = Cerne Abbas Giant = 
 The Cerne Abbas Giant is a hill figure near the village of Cerne Abbas in Dorset , England . Made by a turf @-@ cut outline filled with chalk , it depicts a large naked man with an erect penis and is typically described as a giant wielding a club . The figure is listed as a scheduled monument in the United Kingdom and the site where he stands is owned by the National Trust . 
 The origin and age of the figure are unclear . It is often thought of as an ancient construction , though the earliest mention of it dates to the late 17th century . Early antiquarians associated it , on little evidence , with a Saxon deity , while other scholars sought to identify it with a Celtic British figure of the Roman Hercules or some <unk> of the two . Archaeological evidence that parts of the drawing have been lost over time strengthen the Hercules identification . The lack of earlier descriptions leads modern scholars to conclude that it may date from the 17th century , and perhaps originated as political satire . 
 Regardless of its age , the Cerne Abbas Giant has become an important part of local culture and folklore , which often associates it with fertility . It is one of England 's best known hill figures and is a visitor attraction in the region .

 The Cerne Abbas Giant is located just outside the small village of Cerne Abbas in Dorset , about 48 kilometres ( 30 mi ) west of Bournemouth and 26 kilometres ( 16 mi ) north of Weymouth . The figure depicts a huge naked man , about 55 metres ( 180 ft ) high and 51 metres ( 167 ft ) wide . It is carved into the white chalk rock on the steep west @-@ facing side of a hill known as Giant Hill or Trendle Hill . Atop the hill is another landmark , the Iron Age earthwork known as the " Trendle " or " Frying Pan " . The carving is formed by outlines cut into the turf about 0 @.@ 6 metres ( 2 ft 0 in ) deep , and filled with crushed chalk . In his right hand the giant holds a <unk> club 37 metres ( 121 ft ) in length , and adding 11 metres ( 36 ft ) to the total height of the figure . A line across the waist is considered to be a belt . Writing in 1901 in the Proceedings of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society , Henry Colley March noted that : " The Cerne Giant presents five characteristics : ( 1 ) It is petrographic ... It is , therefore , a rock carving ... ( 2 ) It is colossal ... ( 3 ) It is nude . ... ( 4 ) It is ithyphallic ... ( 5 ) The Giant is <unk> . It bears a weapon in its right hand . " 
 A 1996 study found that some features have changed over time , concluding that the figure originally held a cloak in its left arm and stood over a disembodied head . The former presence of a cloak was corroborated in 2008 when a team of archaeologists using special equipment determined that part of the carving had been allowed to be obliterated . The cloak may have been a depiction of an animal skin , giving credence to the theory that the giant was a depiction of a hunter , or alternatively , Hercules with the skin of the Nemean lion over his arm . Additionally , reviewing historical depictions of the giant , it has been suggested that the Giant 's current large erection is , in fact , the result of merging a circle representing his navel with a smaller penis during a re @-@ cut . In 1993 , the National Trust gave the Giant a " nose job " after years of erosion had worn it away . 
 The Giant has been described as " renowned for its manhood " , " markedly phallic " , " sexually explicit " and " ithyphallic " . The Giant sports an erection , including its testicles , some 11 metres ( 36 feet ) long , and nearly the length of its head . It has been called " Britain 's most famous phallus " . One commentator noted that postcards of the Giant were the only indecent photographs that could be sent through the English Post Office . 
 The carving is most commonly known as the Cerne Abbas Giant . The National Trust and others call it the " Cerne Giant " , while English Heritage and Dorset County Council call it simply " The Giant " . The carving has also been referred to as the " Old Man " , and more recently it has been referred to as the " Rude Man " of Cerne . 
 Although the best view of the Giant is from the air , most tourist guides recommend a ground view from the " Giant 's View " lay @-@ by and car park off the <unk> . This area was developed in 1979 in a joint project between the Dorset County Planning Department , the National Trust , Nature Conservancy Council ( now called English Nature ) , the Dorset Naturalists Trusts , the Department of the Environment , and local land @-@ owners . The information panel there was devised by the National Trust and Dorset County Council .
