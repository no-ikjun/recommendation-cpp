 A North Korean tank column equipped with ex @-@ Soviet T @-@ 34 / 85 tanks overran the task force in the first encounter and continued its advance south . After the North Korean tank column had breached U.S. lines the Task Force opened fire on a force of some 5 @,@ 000 North Korean infantry approaching its position , temporarily holding up the North Korean advance . North Korean troops eventually flanked and overwhelmed American positions and the remnants of the Task Force retreated in disorder .

 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 On the night of June 25 , 1950 , ten divisions of the North Korean People 's Army launched a full @-@ scale invasion of the nation 's neighbor to the south , the Republic of Korea . The force of 89 @,@ 000 men moved in six columns , catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise , resulting in a rout . The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment , and was unprepared for war . The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38 @,@ 000 South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south . Most of South Korea 's forces retreated in the face of the invasion . The North Koreans had captured South Korea 's capital of Seoul by June 28 , forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat further south . 
 To prevent South Korea 's collapse the United Nations Security Council voted to send military forces . The United States ' Seventh Fleet dispatched Task Force 77 , led by the fleet carrier USS Valley Forge ; the British Far East Fleet dispatched several ships , including HMS Triumph , to provide air and naval support . Although the navies blockaded North Korea and launched aircraft to delay the North Korean forces these efforts alone did not stop the North Korean Army juggernaut on its southern advance . U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered ground troops into the country to supplement the air support . The strength of U.S. forces in the Far East , however , had steadily declined since the end of World War II five years earlier and the closest unit was the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army , headquartered in Japan . Cuts in U.S. military spending meant the division was under strength and using outmoded equipment . 
 Division commander , Major General William F. Dean determined that the 21st Infantry Regiment was the most combat @-@ ready of the 24th Infantry Division 's three regiments . Dean decided to send the 21st Infantry 's 1st Battalion from the formation because its commander , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bradford Smith , was the most experienced leading man , having experience at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II . C @-@ 54 Skymaster transport aircraft airlifted one battalion from the division garrison under Smith 's command into Korea . The battalion deployed quickly to block advancing North Korean forces , performing a holding action while the rest of the division could be moved to South Korea by sea .

 When you get to Pusan , head for Taejon . We want to stop the North Koreans as far from Pusan as we can . Block the main road as far north as possible . Make contact with General Church . If you can 't find him , go to Taejon and beyond if you can . Sorry I can 't give you more information — that 's all I 've got . Good luck , and God bless you and your men ! 
 The first units of the 24th Infantry Division left Itazuke Air Base in Japan on June 30 . Task Force Smith , named for its commander , consisted of 406 men of the 1st Battalion , 21st Infantry Regiment , as well as 134 men of A Battery , 52nd Field Artillery Battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Miller O. Perry . The forces were both poorly equipped and understrength : 1st Battalion , 21st Infantry had only two companies of infantry ( B and C Company ) , as opposed to the regulation three for a U.S. Army battalion . The battalion had half of the required number of troops in its Headquarters Company , half of a communications platoon , and half of a heavy weapons platoon , which was armed with six obsolescent M9A1 Bazooka rocket launchers , two 75mm recoilless rifles , two 4 @.@ 2 inch mortars , and four 60mm mortars . Much of this equipment was drawn from the rest of the under @-@ strength 21st . A Battery , which formed the entire artillery support for the Task Force , was armed with six 105mm howitzers . These howitzers were equipped with 1 @,@ 200 HE ( high explosive ) rounds , but these were incapable of penetrating tank armor . Only six High Explosive Anti @-@ Tank ( HEAT ) rounds were issued to the battery , all of them allocated to the number six howitzer sited forward of the main battery emplacement . A Battery also had 4 .50 calibre M2 Browning heavy machine guns . 
 Most of the soldiers of the Task Force were teenagers with no combat experience and only eight weeks of basic training . Only one third of the officers in the Task Force had combat experience from World War II , and only one in six enlisted soldiers had combat experience . Many of them nevertheless volunteered to join the task force . The soldiers were each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of C @-@ rations . 
 By July 1 , Task Force Smith had fully arrived in South Korea and briefly established a headquarters in Taejon . The task force soon after began moving north by rail and truck to oppose the North Korean army . Task Force Smith was the first of several small U.S. units sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial " shock " of North Korean advances , delaying much larger North Korean units with the goal of buying time to allow more U.S. units into Korea . Task Force Smith 's mission was to move as far north as possible and begin engaging the North Koreans to stem their advance so that the rest of the 24th Infantry Division could be moved into South Korea to re @-@ enforce it . The 24th Division commander William F. Dean personally ordered Smith to stop the North Korean force along the highway from Suwon and " as far from Pusan " as possible . 
 Three days later , on July 4 , it dug in on two hills straddling the road north of the village of Osan , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) south of Suwon and about 25 miles ( 40 km ) south of Seoul . These ridges rose up to 300 ft ( 91 m ) above the road , providing visibility almost the entire distance to Suwon . The battalion set up a 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) long line over these ridges . There they waited to meet the advancing North Korean forces . The force was placed along the road with the infantry formations on the two hills , five of the howitzers sited 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) behind the infantry , and the sixth with its six HEAT shells positioned halfway between the infantry and other five field artillery pieces . Heavy rain made air support impossible so Smith and Perry <unk> the artillery battery in hopes it would be just as effective . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Tank columns = = = 
 At around 0730 on July 5 , Task Force Smith spotted a column of eight North Korean T @-@ 34 / 85 tanks of the 107th Tank Regiment , North Korean 105th Armored Division heading south toward them . The North Korean forces , driving south from Seoul , were in pursuit of retreating South Korean forces . At <unk> the artillery battery fired its first rounds at the advancing North Korean tanks . The tanks , which were around 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from the infantry force , were hit with numerous 105mm howitzer rounds , but were unaffected . When the tanks closed to 700 m ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) the 75mm recoilless rifles fired , scoring direct hits on the lead tanks but did not damage them . The North Korean tanks returned fire , but they were unable to locate the American positions and gun emplacements , and their fire was ineffective . 
 Once the tanks reached the infantry line Second Lieutenant Ollie Connor fired some 22 2 @.@ 36 @-@ inch rockets at a range of 15 yd ( 14 m ) from his M9A1 launcher tube . Some of these rockets failed to ignite . The remainder did and several struck the rear plate armor of several T @-@ 34s , where their armor was thinnest . The warheads failed to penetrate the armor , however , and the North Korean tanks continued their advance , ignoring the roadblock and continuing down the road . The operators assumed the roadblock was manned by South Korean troops , and ignored it since it did not pose them a serious threat . When the tank column came over the crest of the road , the forward howitzer , commanded by Corporal Herman V. Critchfield , Chief of Section and 5 cannoneers , fired its HEAT rounds , damaging the first two tanks and setting one of them on fire . One of the crew members of the burning tank emerged with a PPSh @-@ 41 and killed a member of an American machine gun crew before being killed himself ; the American became the first casualty of Korean War ground combat . He was later identified , incorrectly , as Kenneth R. Shadrick . The howitzer , depleted of HEAT rounds , began firing high explosive rounds before being destroyed by the third T @-@ 34 . The tanks then advanced , continuing to ignore the American howitzer and bazooka fire . U.S. forces managed to disable another North Korean T @-@ 34 when a 105mm shell struck and damaged its tracks . The tracks of the T @-@ 34 tanks cut communication signal wires between the infantry and artillery forces , further compounding the confusion . Perry was wounded in the leg by North Korean small arms fire as he was attempting to get the crew of the disabled tank to surrender . His artillery force continued firing at the North Korean tanks without effect . 
 A second column of 25 T @-@ 34 tanks approached the Task Force within an hour . This second T @-@ 34 formation advanced singly or by twos , and threes , close together with no apparent formal organization . The howitzer battery hit another tank from this column in its tracks , disabling it , and damaged three more . The North Korean tanks had destroyed the forward howitzer ( number six ) and wounded one of its crew members , had killed or wounded an estimated twenty infantrymen , and had destroyed all the parked vehicles behind the infantry line . At the main battery position one of the five remaining 105mm guns had been slightly damaged by a near @-@ hit . Several of the men in the artillery battery began deserting their positions but Perry managed to convince most of them to return . Although Smith later stated that he believed that the rounds had deteriorated with age , the ineffectiveness of the 2 @.@ 36 @-@ inch bazooka had been demonstrated repeatedly during World War II against German armor . Because of peacetime defense cutbacks the 24th Infantry Division had never received improved U.S. M20 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch bazookas with <unk> HEAT antitank ammunition , capable of defeating Soviet tanks . After the last tanks passed their lines , no North Korean forces were spotted for around an hour . 
 = = = Infantry column = = = 
 Three more tanks were sighted advancing from the north at around 1100 . Behind them was a column of trucks 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) long , carrying two full infantry regiments ; the 16th Infantry Regiment and the 18th Infantry Regiment of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division , amounting to almost 5 @,@ 000 troops under the command of Major General Lee Kwon Mu , which were advancing from Seoul . The column apparently was not in communication with the tanks that had preceded it , and the North Korean infantry was not aware of the Americans ' presence . 
 At 1145 , when the column had advanced to within 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) of the Americans , Smith gave the order for the task force to open fire with everything it had . The mortar , machine gun , artillery , and rifle fire destroyed several trucks , scattering the column . The three lead tanks moved to within 300 m ( 980 ft ) of Task Force Smith and opened fire . Behind them , around 1 @,@ 000 of the infantry formed in the rice paddies to the east of the road in an attempt to envelop the American forces but were repulsed . Smith attempted to order artillery fire on the North Korean force but runners were unable to get back to the field artillery positions , and so he assumed they had been destroyed by the tanks . Within 45 minutes another enveloping force formed to the west of the road , forcing Smith to withdraw a platoon to the east side of the road . Quickly thereafter the American infantry began taking mortar and artillery fire from the North Koreans . 
 = = = American withdrawal = = = 
 Task Force Smith managed to hold its lines for three hours , but at 1430 Smith ordered the Americans to withdraw , suffering from low ammunition and a breakdown of communications . At this point North Korean forces were moving on both flanks of the American force and toward the rear of the formation . Smith ordered an orderly withdrawal of the force one unit at a time , allowing the rest of the force to cover it as it withdrew . C Company pulled back , followed by the American medics , the headquarters , and finally B Company . 2nd Platoon , B Company , however , did not receive the withdrawal order . When the platoon discovered that it was alone , it was too late for an orderly withdrawal and it could not move its wounded quickly enough . The platoon left most of its equipment in its positions , which was captured by the North Koreans . Most of the survivors were able to escape captivity but a number of wounded litter @-@ borne U.S. soldiers were left behind along with an attending medic . The American wounded were later found shot to death in their litters ; the medic was never seen again . One North Korean officer later told historian John Toland that the American forces at the battle seemed " too frightened to fight . " 
 The retreat quickly broke down into a confused and disorganized rout . Task Force Smith suffered its highest casualties during this withdrawal as its soldiers were most exposed to enemy fire . The surviving members of Task Force Smith reached Battery A 's position . The artillerymen disabled the five remaining howitzers by removing their sights and <unk> and retired in good order with the remains of the Task Force on foot to the northern outskirts of Osan , where most of the unit 's hidden transport vehicles were found intact . The vehicles , unmolested by the North Korean forces , departed for Pyongtaek and Cheonan , picking up stragglers along the way , eventually joining units of the 24th Infantry Division that had established a second line of defense . 
 250 of Task Force Smith 's force had returned to the American lines before nightfall , with about 150 more of the force killed , wounded or missing . Most of the other stragglers found their way into the American lines over the next several days . The last stragglers from 2nd Platoon , B Company reached Chonan five days later , only 30 minutes ahead of the North Korean army . Upon the initial count , Task Force Smith suffered 20 killed in action , 130 wounded in action or missing in action , and around 36 captured . After the end of the war this figure was revised to 60 dead , 21 wounded and 82 captured , 32 of whom died in captivity . The first of the troops reported killed was Kenneth R. Shadrick . This casualty count accounted for 40 percent of Task Force Smith . U.S. troops advancing northward during the Pusan breakout offensive would later discover a series of shallow graves containing the bodies of several soldiers of the 24th Infantry Division . All had been shot in the back of the head , their hands bound behind their backs with communications wire . North Korean casualties were approximately 42 dead and 85 wounded , with four tanks destroyed or immobilized . The North Korean advance was delayed approximately seven hours . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Battle of Osan was the first U.S. ground action of the war . The fight showed that American forces were weak and unprepared for the war ; outdated equipment was insufficient to fight North Korean armor and poorly trained and inexperienced units were no match for better @-@ trained North Korean troops – though the disparity in number of troops engaged certainly had a profound effect on the outcome of this and future battles . <unk> U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely , leaving equipment and wounded for North Korean troops to capture . Smith also said he felt he had stayed too long in his position , allowing North Korean troops to envelop the force and cause heavy casualties as it retreated . These weaknesses would play out with other U.S. units for the next month as North Korean troops pushed them further back . 
 Though the force was badly defeated Task Force Smith accomplished its mission of delaying North Korean forces from advancing for several hours . During the battle the 24th Infantry Division 's 34th Infantry Regiment was able to set up in <unk> , 15 mi ( 24 km ) to the south . It would be similarly defeated in the Battle of Pyongtaek . Over the next month the 24th Infantry Division would fight in numerous engagements to delay North Korean forces with similar results . Within a week , the 24th Infantry Division had been pushed back to Taejon where it was again defeated in the Battle of Taejon . The North Koreans , overwhelming U.S. forces time and again , were able to push the Eighth Army all the way back to Pusan , where the Battle of the Pusan Perimeter would culminate in the eventual defeat of the North Korean Army . 
 Three months later , on September 19 , Osan would be the location where the U.S. and U.N. forces under the command of the Eighth Army , advancing from the south , would meet up with forces of X Corps , advancing from the north after having recently surprised the North Koreans with the Inchon Landings , as the two forces were in an offensive pushing the North Koreans back , which would culminate in a complete defeat of the North Korean Army in the south . 
 In the years following the Korean War the U.S. Army used the areas in Japan where Task Force Smith had trained as a memorial . A monument to Task Force Smith was also established on the Osan battlefield , where an annual commemoration of the Battle of Osan is held by the Eighth Army , which is still headquartered in South Korea . On July 16 , 2010 , 60 years after the Battle of Osan , Eighth Army leaders , in conjunction with government officials of Osan , held another ceremony , speaking of Task Force Smith and describing the engagement as " the opening shots of a war of ideas that exists even today . " On the 61st anniversary , another ceremony was held by both US military and Osan politicians to remember the task force . 
 = Terminator 2 : Judgment Day = 
 Terminator 2 : Judgment Day ( also referred to as simply Terminator 2 or T2 ) is a 1991 American science fiction action film co @-@ written , produced and directed by James Cameron . The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger , Linda Hamilton , Robert Patrick and Edward Furlong . It is the sequel to the 1984 film The Terminator , and the second installment in the Terminator franchise . Terminator 2 follows Sarah Connor ( Hamilton ) and her ten @-@ year @-@ old son John ( Furlong ) as they are pursued by a new , more advanced Terminator , the liquid metal , shapeshifting T @-@ 1000 ( Patrick ) , sent back in time to kill John Connor and prevent him from becoming the leader of the human resistance . A second , less advanced Terminator ( Schwarzenegger ) is also sent back in time to protect John . 
 After a troubled pre @-@ production characterized by legal disputes , Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures emerged with the franchise 's property rights in early 1990 . This paved the way for the completion of the screenplay by a Cameron @-@ led production team , and the October 1990 start of a shortened 186 @-@ day filming schedule . The production of Terminator 2 required a $ 102 million budget making it the most expensive film made up to that point . Much of the film 's massive budget was spent on filming and special effects . The film was released on July 3 , 1991 , in time for the U.S. Independence Day weekend . 
 The film 's visual effects saw breakthroughs in computer @-@ generated imagery , including the first use of natural human motion for a computer @-@ generated character and the first partially computer @-@ generated main character . Terminator 2 was a critical and commercial success and influenced popular culture , especially the use of visual effects in films . It received many accolades , including four Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing , Best Sound Mixing , Best Makeup , and Best Visual Effects . The highest @-@ grossing film of 1991 and Schwarzenegger 's career , Terminator 2 has since been ranked by several publications such as the American Film Institute as one of the greatest action films , science fiction films and sequels of all time . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1995 , John Connor is living in Los Angeles with foster parents . His mother Sarah Connor had been preparing him throughout his childhood for his future role as the Human Resistance leader against Skynet – the artificial intelligence that will be given control of the United States ' nuclear missiles and initiate a nuclear holocaust called " Judgment Day " in 1997 – but was arrested and imprisoned at a mental hospital after attempting to bomb a computer factory . Skynet sends a new Terminator , designated as T @-@ 1000 , back in time to kill John . The T @-@ 1000 is an advanced prototype made out of mimetic <unk> ( referred to as " liquid metal " ) that gives it the ability to take on the shape and appearance of almost anything it touches , as well as knives and other stabbing weapons . The T @-@ 1000 arrives under a freeway , kills a policeman and assumes his identity . Meanwhile , the future John Connor has sent back a reprogrammed T @-@ 800 ( Model 101 ) Terminator to protect the younger version of himself . 
 The Terminator and the T @-@ 1000 converge on John in a shopping mall , and a chase ensues after which John and the Terminator escape together on a motorcycle . Fearing that the T @-@ 1000 will kill Sarah in order to get to him , John orders the Terminator to help free her . They encounter Sarah as she is escaping from the hospital , although she is initially reluctant to trust the T @-@ 800 . After the trio escapes from the T @-@ 1000 in a police car , the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet 's history . In addition , it would create machines that will hunt and kill the remnants of humanity . Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet 's creation is Miles Bennett Dyson , a Cyberdyne Systems engineer working on a revolutionary new neural net processor that will form the basis for Skynet . 
 Sarah gathers weapons from an old friend and plans to flee with John to Mexico , but after having a nightmare about Judgment Day , she instead sets out to kill Dyson in order to prevent Judgment Day from occurring . Finding him at his home , she wounds him but finds herself unable to kill him in front of his family . John and the Terminator arrive and inform Dyson of the future consequences of his work . They learn that much of his research has been reverse engineered from the damaged CPU and the right arm of the previous Terminator . Convincing him that these items and his designs must be destroyed , they break into the Cyberdyne building and retrieve the CPU and the arm . The police arrive and Dyson is shot , but he manages to trigger several explosives , destroying the lab and his research while sacrificing himself . The T @-@ 1000 relentlessly pursues the surviving trio , eventually cornering them in a steel mill . 
 The T @-@ 1000 and the Terminator engage in physical combat , with the advanced model severely damaging its adversary . The T @-@ 800 is seemingly shut down until its emergency back @-@ up system brings it back online . The T @-@ 1000 nearly kills John and Sarah until the T @-@ 800 appears and shoots it into a vat of molten steel with an M79 grenade launcher , destroying it . John tosses the arm and CPU of the original Terminator into the vat as well . As Sarah expresses relief that the ordeal is over , the Terminator explains that to ensure that he is not used for reverse engineering he must also be destroyed . It asks Sarah to assist in lowering it into the vat of molten steel , since it is unable to " self @-@ terminate " , although John begs the Terminator to reconsider his decision . It bids them farewell as it is lowered into the vat . The Terminator gives a tearful John a final thumbs @-@ up as it disappears into the molten steel and shuts down . Sarah looks to the future with hope , musing that " if a machine ... can learn the value of human life , maybe we can too . "

 Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator / T @-@ 800 ( Model 101 ) : 
 An android , built as a synthetic organism composed of living tissue over a titanium " <unk> " endoskeleton , reprogrammed and sent back in time to protect John Connor . Schwarzenegger was reportedly paid $ 15 million for the role . 
 Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor : 
 Mother of John , the future leader of the Resistance in the war against Skynet . Hamilton reprised her role from the 1984 film for a salary of $ 1 million . In preparation for the role , Hamilton underwent an extensive thirteen @-@ week training regimen with personal trainer Anthony Cortes , training for three hours each day , six days a week before filming began . She additionally lost 12 pounds ( 5 @.@ 4 kg ) on a <unk> diet , conducted throughout the film 's six @-@ month shoot . Actor and former Israeli commando Uzi Gal provided her with training for her action scenes . On her work with Gal , Hamilton stated that she undertook " judo and heavy @-@ duty military training " and " learned to load clips , change mags , check out a room upon entry , verify kills . " Hamilton 's twin sister Leslie Hamilton Gearren also portrayed Sarah when it was required that there be two of the character in the same shot . 
 Edward Furlong as John Connor : 
 The ten @-@ year @-@ old son of Sarah , given survival training from a young age , but taken into foster care after his mother is institutionalized . Furlong was discovered by casting director Mali Finn while visiting the Pasadena Boys and Girls Club . Furlong , who had no acting ambitions at the time , stated , " I fell into [ acting ] , it wasn 't something that I planned " . The adult John of 2029 AD is played by Michael Edwards . 
 Robert Patrick as the T @-@ 1000 : 
 An advanced shapeshifting prototype Terminator composed of liquid metal sent back in time to assassinate John . Cameron stated that he " wanted to find someone who would be a good contrast to Arnold . If the 800 series [ the model played by Schwarzenegger ] is a kind of human Panzer tank , then the 1000 series had to be a Porsche . " 
 Joe Morton as Miles Bennett Dyson : 
 Director of special projects at Cyberdyne and a destined creator of Skynet . 
 Earl Boen as Dr. Peter Silberman : 
 Sarah 's psychiatrist , skeptical of her prophecies of machines destroying humanity . Boen is also reprising his character from the 1984 film .

 = = = Development = = = 
 Talk of a potential sequel to The Terminator arose soon after its release , but several outstanding issues precluded such a production . There were technical limitations regarding computer @-@ generated imagery , a vital aspect of the film that would be crucial in the creation of the T @-@ 1000 Terminator . The production of James Cameron 's 1989 film The Abyss provided the proof of concept needed to satisfactorily resolve the technical concerns . Perhaps more serious were the intellectual @-@ property disputes between Hemdale Film Corporation , which owned the franchise and stymied efforts to produce a sequel , and Carolco Pictures . Given that Hemdale was then experiencing financial problems , Arnold Schwarzenegger urged Mario Kassar , head of Carolco , to bid for the rights : " I reminded Mario that this is something that we 've been looking for four years , and that it should be him that should go all @-@ out , no matter what it takes to make this deal . " Carolco eventually paid Hemdale $ 5 million for the franchise in 1990 , resolving the legal gridlock . 
 The end of the legal disputes coincided with the willingness and availability of Cameron , Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton to participate in the sequel ; Schwarzenegger , who portrayed the Terminator in the first film , commented : " I always felt we should continue the story of The Terminator , I told Jim that right after we finished the first film . " He and Hamilton reprised their respective roles from the first Terminator film . After an extensive casting search , 12 @-@ year @-@ old Edward Furlong was selected from hundreds of candidates to portray John Connor ; Robert Patrick was chosen to play the T @-@ 1000 Terminator because his agility would emphasize the disparity between the advanced T @-@ 1000 and Schwarzenegger 's older T @-@ 800 ( Cameron characterized the two as " a Porsche " and " a human Panzer tank " respectively ) . Patrick had previously appeared in the action feature Die Hard 2 , but Furlong had no formal acting experience . Joe Morton was picked to portray Miles Dyson , a Cyberdyne scientist who helped develop the new CPU for the T @-@ 800 Terminators . 
 Calling themselves T2 Productions , James and co @-@ producers Stephanie Austin and B.J. Rack rented an office in North Hollywood , Los Angeles , before starting to assemble the crew for Terminator 2 . Adam Greenberg , who worked on The Terminator and Ghost ( 1990 ) , became director of photography , while Joseph Nemec III , who had worked with Cameron on The Abyss , was tasked with production design . The team conducted a national search for a steel mill suitable for the film 's climax , eventually selecting a dormant mill in Fontana , California , after weeks of negotiations . Locating a potential Cyberdyne building was more difficult , as the site was to host numerous stunts , shootouts , and explosions . An industrial park in Fremont , California , was eventually rented for the duration of the film 's production . Cameron and William Wisher completed the 140 @-@ page screenplay draft on May 10 , 1990 , and by July 15 , the first shooting draft had been distributed to the cast and crew ; particulars of the technically detailed scripts were shrouded in secrecy . Both the six @-@ week turnaround for the script and the film 's accelerated production schedule were to enable a 1991 Fourth of July release . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography of Terminator 2 spanned 171 days between October 9 , 1990 , and March 28 , 1991 , during which the crew filmed at the Mojave Desert before visiting 20 different sites throughout California and New Mexico . These locations ran the gamut from the crowded Santa Monica Place shopping mall , where the two Terminators converged on John , to flood control channels in the San Fernando Valley , which played host to the chase between the Terminators and John ; a river had to be redirected to allow filming on the otherwise wet channels . Cameron and his crew also filmed Terminator 2 at The Corral Bar and the Lake View Medical Center ( known as Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in the film ) , both located in Lake View Terrace . The external shots of Cyberdyne Systems Corporation were filmed on location at an office building on the corner of Gateway Boulevard and Bayside Parkway in Fremont , California . Working with up to 1 @,@ 000 crew members , the production team oversaw numerous stunts and chase sequences , the most notable of which took place on the Los Angeles – Long Beach Terminal Island Freeway , prior to Terminator 2 's climax . Ten miles ( 16 km ) of electric cables were laid to illuminate the night @-@ time chase , which saw a full @-@ scale helicopter crash , a sliding tanker , and other elaborate paraphernalia . 
 Hamilton 's twin sister , Leslie Hamilton Gearren , was used in some shots that required two <unk> , including a scene where Sarah and John perform repairs on the Terminator 's head ( deleted from the theatrical release , but restored on the extended edition ) , and in some of the shots where the T @-@ 1000 impersonates Sarah . Gearren is playing whichever " Sarah " is farthest from the camera , alternating between the real Sarah and the T @-@ 1000 based on camera position . Another set of twins , Don and Dan Stanton , were used to depict a scene where the T @-@ 1000 mimics a guard at the asylum . 
 An unprecedented budget of $ 102 million ( 1991 dollars ) — 3 @.@ 5 times the cost of the average film and approximately 15 times the $ 6 @.@ 4 million budget of The Terminator — was reserved for Terminator 2 . A significant proportion of this was for actor and film @-@ crew salaries . According to The Daily Sentinel and The Daily Beast , Arnold Schwarzenegger was given a $ 11 – 12 million Gulfstream III business jet , while $ 5 – 6 million was allocated towards James Cameron 's salary . The production itself , which included special effects and stunts , totalled $ 51 million . Despite the significant expenditure , the film had nearly recovered its budget prior to its release . Worldwide rights were sold for $ 65 million , video rights for $ 10 million , and television rights for $ 7 million . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 Terminator 2 made extensive use of computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) to <unk> the main two Terminators . The use of such technology was the most ambitious since the 1982 science fiction film Tron , and would be integral to the critical success of the film . CGI was required particularly for the T @-@ 1000 , a " mimetic poly @-@ alloy " ( liquid metal ) structure , since the shapeshifting character can transform into almost anything it touches . Most of the key Terminator effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) for computer graphics and Stan Winston for practical effects . Creation of the visual effects cost $ 5 million and took 35 people , including animators , computer scientists , technicians and artists , ten months to produce , for a total of 25 man @-@ years . Despite the large amount of time spent , the CGI sequences only total five minutes of running time . Enlisted to produce articulated puppets and prosthetic effects was Stan Winston 's studio , who was also responsible for the metal skeleton effects of the T @-@ 800 . ILM 's Visual Effects Supervisor , Dennis Muren , remarked , " We still have not lost the spirit of amazement when we see ... [ the visual effects on the T @-@ 1000 ] coming up . " Such was the role and creation of CGI that the visual @-@ effects team was awarded the 1992 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects .

 The Montreal Film Journal called it " one of the best crafted Hollywood action flicks . " Screenwriting guru Syd Field lauded the plot of Terminator 2 , saying , for example , " every scene sets up the next , like links in a chain of dramatic action . " Roger Ebert , writing for the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , who gave the film 3 @.@ 5 stars out of a possible 4 , praised Schwarzenegger 's performance , saying , " Schwarzenegger 's genius as a movie star is to find roles that build on , rather than undermine , his physical and vocal characteristics . " Hal Hinson , reviewer for The Washington Post , was also very positive in his review , writing that : " No one in the movies today can match Cameron 's talent for this kind of hyperbolic , big @-@ screen action . Cameron , who directed the first Terminator and Aliens , doesn 't just slam us over the head with the action . In staging the movie 's gigantic set pieces , he has an eye for both grandeur and beauty ; he possesses that rare director 's gift for transforming the objects he shoots so that we see , for example , the lyrical muscularity of an 18 @-@ wheel truck . Because of Cameron , the movie is the opposite of its Terminator character ; it 's a machine with a human heart . " Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune was extremely enthusiastic about the film , giving it 3 1 / 2 stars , " thanks to some truly spectacular and at times mystifying special effects – as well as some surprisingly solid acting , this is one terrific action picture , more enjoyable than the original . " Further , Siskel noted , " the level of tension in the film is palpable because we can 't figure out how Arnold is going to terminate the Terminator . " 
 Halliwell 's Film Guide rated the film as an improvement on its predecessor , giving it two stars out of four and describing it as a " thunderous , high @-@ voltage action movie with dazzling special effects that provide a distraction from the often silly narrative . " Writing for Time , Richard Corliss was far less pleased , stating that the film was a " humongous , visionary parable that intermittently <unk> and ultimately disappoints . T2 is half of a terrific movie — the wrong half . " Leonard Maltin gave the movie only 2 1 / 2 stars , stating , " like so many sequels , lacks the freshness of the first film and gives us no one to root for . "

 = 2 / 6th Battalion ( Australia ) = 
 The 2 / 6th Battalion was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army that served during the Second World War . Raised in October 1939 as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force , the battalion formed part of the 6th Division and was among the first troops raised by Australia during the war . Departing Australia in early 1940 , the 2 / 6th were deployed to the Middle East where in January 1941 , it took part in the first action of the war by Australian ground forces , the Battle of Bardia , which was followed by further actions around Tobruk . Later , the 2 / 6th were dispatched to take part in the Battle of Greece , although their involvement in the campaign was short before they were evacuated . Some members of the battalion also subsequently fought on Crete with a composite 17th Brigade battalion , and afterwards the battalion had to be re @-@ formed in Palestine before being sent to Syria in 1941 – 42 , where they formed part of the Allied occupation force that was established there in the aftermath of the Syria – Lebanon campaign . 
 In mid @-@ 1942 , the battalion was withdrawn from the Middle East to help face the threat posed by the Japanese in the Pacific . A period of garrison duty was undertaken in Ceylon between March and July 1942 , before they arrived back in Australia in August 1942 . Following this , the 2 / 6th deployed to New Guinea in January 1943 , fighting around Wau and then advancing towards Salamaua during the Salamaua – Lae campaign . They were withdrawn to the Atherton Tablelands for rest in September 1943 and subsequently did not see action again until later in the war , when they were committed to the Aitape – Wewak campaign in late 1944 . The 2 / 6th remained in New Guinea until the end of the war , and was disbanded in February 1946 , after returning to Puckapunyal the previous December .

 = = = Formation and training = = = 
 The 2 / 6th Battalion was raised at the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds on 25 October 1939 , as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force , which was raised for overseas service at the start of the war . The battalion 's motto was " Nothing over us " , which it adopted due to a popular Coles advertising slogan of the time which used the words " Nothing over 2 / 6 " . The colours chosen for the battalion 's Unit Colour Patch ( UCP ) were the same as those of the 6th Battalion , a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921 . These colours were purple over red , in a horizontal rectangular shape , although a border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart . 
 In early November , after it had started concentration , the battalion – consisting at that stage of just a small cadre force of officers and non @-@ commissioned officers drawn mainly from several Militia units including the 14th , the 23rd / 21st , the 29th , and the 46th Battalions – was moved to Puckapunyal , Victoria . While there , it received a number of drafts of recruits and was brought up to strength . With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel , like other Australian infantry battalions of the time , the battalion was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies – designated ' A ' through to ' D ' – each consisting of three platoons . 
 A short period of rudimentary training followed under the tutelage of members of the Australian Instructional Corps . This was completed by April 1940 , and that month the battalion – under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Godfrey , a First World War veteran who had previously commanded the 23rd / 21st Battalion – embarked for the Middle East on the transport ship <unk> , departing from Port Melbourne and sailing via Fremantle , Colombo , Aden and the Suez Canal . At this time it was attached to the 17th Brigade , which was assigned to the 6th Division . Recruited from Victoria – although at various times the battalion 's composition was boosted by recruits from other states – the 17th also consisted of the 2 / 5th , 2 / 7th and 2 / 8th Battalions . 
 = = = Middle East , Greece and Crete = = = 
 Upon their arrival in mid @-@ May , the battalion established itself around Beit Jirja , and completed its training at various locations in Palestine and Egypt . In early January 1941 , the 6th Division was committed to the fighting in Libya , and the 2 / 6th took part in the first action of the war by Australian ground forces , the Battle of Bardia , during which they fought against Italian forces . The battalion 's involvement in the battle was meant to be limited to creating a diversion for the main attack , but in the end proved to be its most costly , resulting in 22 killed and 51 wounded . This was followed by further actions around Tobruk later in the month , attacking across the Bardia – Tobruk road towards the harbour through Wadi ed Delia during the 6th Division 's assault . Afterwards , the 2 / 6th was transported to El Gazala , 45 miles ( 72 km ) west of <unk> , where they continued the advance to Derna and beyond in late January , advancing on a two @-@ company front during which they clashed briefly with Italians from the 86th Regiment , capturing over 400 . In February , the 2 / 6th detached personnel to garrison the towns of Barce and Benghazi before moving to Mersa Matruh , where they received new equipment , in late March 1941 . Casualties during this period were 24 dead and 75 wounded . 
 In early April 1941 , the 6th Division was dispatched to Greece , where they fought a very brief campaign following the German invasion of that country in the middle of the month . Overwhelmed , the Allied forces were forced back over the course of several weeks during which the 2 / 6th took part in several desperate rearguard actions and withdrawals during which the battalion lost 28 men killed and 43 wounded . Finally , they were evacuated by sea at the end of the month , but amidst the confusion a large of the battalion 's personnel – 217 personnel from all ranks – were captured , while others were landed on Crete , instead of Alexandria in Egypt , after the ship on which they were sailing , the Costa Rica , was sunk . On Crete , 13 officers and 202 other ranks from the 2 / 6th were organised into a 17th Brigade composite battalion along with men from the brigade 's other battalions less the 2 / 7th . They subsequently fought unsuccessfully to repulse the German invasion that came in May , after which many more became prisoners of war . 
 The battalion 's losses in Greece and Crete were heavy , totaling 30 dead , 54 wounded and 353 captured . As a result , the 2 / 6th had to be re @-@ formed in Palestine and brought back up to strength with reinforcements before it was dispatched Syria in December 1941 , to join the Allied garrison that had been established there as occupation force at the conclusion of the Syria – Lebanon campaign against the Vichy French . In early 1942 , the Australian government decided to bring the 6th Division back to Australia to help bolster its defences following Japan 's entry into the war . Consequently , in March the battalion embarked from Suez on the transport HMT Otranto , bound for Australia . 
 = = = Ceylon and New Guinea = = = 
 On its way home , the battalion – along with the 16th Brigade and the rest of the 17th Brigade – was landed on Ceylon due to the perceived threat of a Japanese invasion there . The battalion remained there for five months , constructing defences and conducting jungle training at various locations including Lake <unk> , <unk> , Matara , <unk> and Hambantota . After the threat of invasion passed , the battalion eventually returned to Melbourne on the transport HMT Athlone Castle , arriving in early August 1942 , at the height of the fighting along the Kokoda Track in Papua . 
 A period of reorganisation and training followed as the battalion was prepared for the rigours of jungle warfare . The battalion concentrated at the Nagambie Road Camp in central Victoria initially , but in late September moved to Greta in New South Wales . In October , after a period of intense training , the 2 / 6th was moved to Brisbane from where , on 13 October 1942 , they embarked on the Dutch merchant ship Bontekoe , bound for Milne Bay for the first of their two campaigns there against the Japanese . After arriving at Milne Bay , where the 17th Brigade was held in reserve , on 19 October they remained there until January 1943 , when the battalion embarked upon the MV <unk> and several smaller coastal vessels and moved to Port Moresby . From Moresby , they were airlifted to Wau on 14 January . During the battalion 's time around Milne Bay , they had suffered heavily from malaria and over 300 men were in hospital at the time the battalion deployed to Wau ; consequently , it was severely understrength by the time it went into battle . Nevertheless , throughout late January 1943 , the battalion was heavily involved in the Battle of Wau , then afterwards took part in the advance on Salamaua , during which it fought several key actions , including the fighting around Lababia Ridge in late June , before supporting the landing at Nassau Bay and the Battle of Mubo in July and then taking part in the fighting around Mount Tambu and Komiatum Ridge in August . During the fighting the battalion sustained casualties of 59 dead and 133 wounded . 
 In late September 1943 , the 2 / 6th were withdrawn to Australia for rest , sailing from Milne Bay on a Dutch transport , the Bosch Fontein , landing in Cairns . They spent the next year training at Wondecla on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland prior to their final campaign of the war : the Aitape – Wewak campaign . Arriving at Aitape in December 1944 , the 2 / 6th spent the remainder of the war – a period of eight months – carrying out a " mopping up campaign " to clear the Japanese from the surrounding areas , conducting a series of patrols and advances through the Torricelli and Prince Alexander Ranges , advancing to Maprik in the early stages of the campaign , and then helping to capture the town of Yamil 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) to the west , clearing a series of jungle ridges in the process before continuing the drive inland towards <unk> in an effort to pin Japanese forces down while the 2 / 7th Battalion conducted a wide sweep towards Kiarivu . Losses during this campaign numbered 37 dead and 85 wounded . 
 The war came to an end in mid @-@ August 1945 following Japan 's surrender in the wake of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . At the conclusion of the fighting , the 2 / 6th remained in New Guinea , concentrating in the area around Wewak . The battalion 's strength was slowly reduced as personnel were repatriated back to Australia individually for demobilisation based upon a formal points system . On 13 December 1945 , the battalion 's remaining personnel sailed for Australia , eventually returning to Puckapunyal . As the battalion 's personnel were slowly demobilised or transferred out to other units its strength decreased rapidly until it was finally was disbanded on 18 February 1946 . Those personnel who were not discharged were transferred to other units for further service . 
 During the war , a total of 2 @,@ 965 men served with the battalion of whom 179 were killed and 335 wounded . Members of the battalion received the following decorations : four Distinguished Service Orders , 15 Military Crosses , five Distinguished Conduct Medals , 35 Military Medals , and 63 Mentions in Despatches .

 = USS Utah ( BB @-@ 31 ) = 
 USS Utah ( BB @-@ 31 / AG @-@ 16 ) was the second and final member of the Florida @-@ class of dreadnought battleships . The first ship of the United States Navy named after the state of Utah , she had one sister ship , Florida . Utah was built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation , laid down in March 1909 and launched in December of that year . She was completed in August 1911 , and boasted a main battery of ten 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns in five twin gun turrets . 
 Utah and Florida were the first ships to arrive during the United States occupation of Veracruz in 1914 during the Mexican Revolution . The two battleships sent ashore a landing party that began the occupation of the city . After the American entrance into World War I , Utah was stationed in Bantry Bay , Ireland , where she protected convoys from potential German surface raiders . Throughout the 1920s , the ship conducted numerous training cruises and fleet maneuvers , and carried dignitaries on tours of South America twice , in 1924 and 1928 . 
 In 1931 , Utah was demilitarized and converted into a target ship and re @-@ designated as AG @-@ 16 , in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty signed the previous year . She was also equipped with numerous anti @-@ aircraft guns of different types to train gunners for the fleet . She served in these two roles for the rest of the decade , and late 1941 found the ship in Pearl Harbor . She was in port on the morning of 7 December , and in the first minutes of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , was hit by two torpedoes , which caused serious flooding . Utah quickly rolled over and sank ; the vast majority of her crew were able to escape , but 64 men were killed in the attack . The wreck remains in the harbor , and in 1972 , a memorial was erected near the ship .

 Utah was 521 ft 6 in ( 158 @.@ 95 m ) long overall and had a beam of 88 ft 3 in ( 26 @.@ 90 m ) and a draft of 28 ft 6 in ( 8 @.@ 69 m ) . She displaced 21 @,@ 825 long tons ( 22 @,@ 175 t ) as designed and up to 23 @,@ 033 long tons ( 23 @,@ 403 t ) at full combat load . The ship was powered by four @-@ shaft Parsons steam turbines rated at 28 @,@ 000 shp ( 20 @,@ 880 kW ) and twelve coal @-@ fired Babcock & Wilcox boilers , generating a top speed of 20 @.@ 75 kn ( 38 @.@ 43 km / h ; 23 @.@ 88 mph ) . The ship had a cruising range of 5 @,@ 776 nmi ( 6 @,@ 650 mi ; 10 @,@ 700 km ) at a speed of 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of 1 @,@ 001 officers and men . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of ten 12 @-@ inch / 45 Mark 5 guns in five twin gun turrets on the centerline , two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward . The other three turrets were placed aft of the superstructure . The secondary battery consisted of sixteen 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 51 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull . As was standard for capital ships of the period , she carried a pair of 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes , submerged in her hull on the broadside . The main armored belt was 11 in ( 279 mm ) thick , while the armored deck was 1 @.@ 5 in ( 38 mm ) thick .

 Utah was laid down at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation on 15 March 1909 . She was launched on 23 December 1909 ; sponsored by Miss Mary Alice Spry , daughter of Governor William Spry of Utah ; and commissioned into the US Navy on 31 August 1911 . She then conducted a shakedown cruise that stopped in Hampton Roads , Santa Rosa Island , Pensacola , Galveston , Kingston , Jamaica , and Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . She was then assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in March 1912 , after which time she participated in gunnery drills . She underwent an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard starting on 16 April . Utah left New York on 1 June and proceeded to Annapolis by way of Hampton Roads , arriving on 6 June . From there , she took a crew of naval cadets from the Naval Academy on a midshipman training cruise off the coast of New England , which lasted until 25 August . 
 For the next two years , Utah followed a similar routine of training exercises and midshipman cruises in the Atlantic . During the period 8 – 30 November 1913 , Utah made a goodwill cruise to European waters , which included a stop in Villefranche , France . In early 1914 during the Mexican Revolution , the United States decided to intervene in the fighting . While en route to Mexico on 16 April , Utah was ordered to intercept the German @-@ flagged steamer SS Ypiranga , which was carrying arms to the Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta . Ypiranga 's arrival in Veracruz prompted the US to occupy the city ; Utah and her sister ship Florida were the first American vessels on the scene . The two ships landed a combined contingent of a thousand Marines and Bluejackets to begin the occupation of the city on 21 April . Over the next three days , the Marines battled rebels in the city and suffered 94 casualties , while killing hundreds of Mexicans in return . 
 Utah remained off Veracruz for two months , before she returned to the New York Navy Yard for an overhaul in late June . She spent the next three years conducting the normal routine of training with the Atlantic Fleet . On 6 April 1917 , the United States entered World War I , declaring war on Germany over its unrestricted submarine warfare campaign against Britain . Utah was stationed in Chesapeake Bay to train engine room personnel and gunners for the rapidly expanding fleet until 30 August 1918 , when she departed for Bantry Bay , Ireland with Vice Admiral Henry T. Mayo , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Atlantic Fleet aboard . After arriving in Ireland , Utah was assigned as the flagship of Battleship Division 6 ( BatDiv 6 ) , commanded by Rear Admiral Thomas S. Rodgers . BatDiv 6 was tasked with covering convoys in the Western Approaches against possible attacks from German surface raiders . Utah served in the division along with Nevada and Oklahoma . 
 Following the end of the war in November 1918 , Utah visited the Isle of Portland in Britain , and escorted the liner George Washington in December , which carried President Woodrow Wilson to Brest , France , for the post @-@ war peace negotiations at Versailles . Utah left Brest on 14 December , and arrived in New York on the 25th of the month . She remained there until 30 January 1919 , after which time she returned to the normal peacetime routine of fleet exercises and training cruises . On 9 July 1921 , Utah departed for Europe , stopping in Lisbon , Portugal , and Cherbourg , France . After arriving , she became the flagship of American warships in Europe . She carried on in this role until she was relieved by the armored cruiser USS Pittsburgh in October 1922 . 
 Utah returned to the US on 21 October , where she returned to her old post as the flagship of BatDiv 6 . In early 1924 , Utah took part in the Fleet Problem III maneuvers , where she and her sister Florida acted as stand @-@ ins for the new Colorado @-@ class battleships . Later that year , Utah was chosen to carry the US diplomatic mission to the centennial celebration of the Battle of Ayacucho , which took place on 9 December 1924 . She left New York on 22 November with General of the Armies John J. Pershing aboard for a goodwill tour of South America ; Utah arrived at Callao , Peru , on 9 December . At the conclusion of Pershing 's tour , Utah met him at Montevideo , Uruguay , and then carried him to other ports , including Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , La Guaira , Venezuela , and Havana , Cuba . The tour ultimately ended when Utah returned Pershing to New York on 13 March 1925 . Utah conducted midshipman training cruises over the summer of 1925 . She was decommissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 31 October 1925 , and placed in drydock for modernization . The modernization replaced her coal @-@ fired boilers with new oil @-@ fired models , and her aft cage mast was replaced with a pole mast . She was reboilered with four White @-@ Forster oil @-@ fired models that had been removed from the battleships and battlecruisers scrapped as a result of the Washington Naval Treaty . Utah also had a catapult mounted on her Number 3 turret along with cranes for handling the floatplanes . 
 Utah returned to active duty on 1 December , after which she served with the Scouting Fleet . She left Hampton Roads on 21 November 1928 for another South American cruise . This time , she picked up President @-@ elect Herbert C. Hoover and his entourage in Montevideo , and transported them to Rio de Janeiro in December , and then carried them home to the United States , arriving in Hampton Roads on 6 January 1929 . According to the terms of the London Naval Treaty of 1930 , Utah was converted into a radio @-@ controlled target ship , to replace the older North Dakota . On 1 July 1931 , Utah was accordingly redesignated " AG @-@ 16 " . All of her primary and secondary weapons were removed , though her turrets were still mounted . The plane handling equipment was remove along with the torpedo blisters that were added in 1925 . Work was completed by 1 April 1932 , when she was recommissioned . 
 On 7 April , Utah left Norfolk for sea trials to train her engine room crew and to test the radio @-@ control equipment . The ship could be controlled at varying rates of speed and changes of course : maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle . Her electric motors , operated by signals from the controlling ship , opened and closed throttle valves , moved her steering gear , and regulated the supply of oil to her boilers . In addition , a Sperry gyro pilot kept the ship on course . She passed her radio control trials on 6 May , and on 1 June , the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control . On 9 June , she again left Norfolk , bound for San Pedro , California , where she joined Training Squadron 1 , Base Force , United States Fleet . Starting in late July , the ship began her first round of target duty , first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet , and then for the battleship Nevada . She continued in this role for the next nine years ; she participated in Fleet Problem XVI in May 1935 , during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines . In June , the ship was modified to train anti @-@ aircraft gunners in addition to her target ship duties . To perform this task , she was equipped with a new 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 28 mm ) / 75 caliber anti @-@ aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon . 
 Utah returned to the Atlantic to participate in Fleet Problem XX in January 1939 , and at the end of the year , she trained with Submarine Squadron 6 . She then returned to the Pacific , arriving in Pearl Harbor on 1 August 1940 . There , she conducted anti @-@ aircraft gunnery training until 14 December , when she departed for Long Beach , California , arriving on 21 December . There , she served as a bombing target for aircraft from the carriers Lexington , Saratoga , and Enterprise . She returned to Pearl Harbor on 1 April 1941 , where she resumed anti @-@ aircraft gunnery training . She cruised to Los Angeles on 20 May to carry a contingent of Marines from the Fleet Marine Force to Bremerton , Washington , after which she entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 31 May , where she was overhauled . She was equipped with new 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 38 cal dual purpose guns in single mounts to improve her ability to train anti @-@ aircraft gunners . She left Puget Sound on 14 September , bound for Pearl Harbor , where she resumed her normal duties through the rest of the year .

 In early December 1941 , Utah was moored off Ford Island in berth F @-@ 11 , after having completed another round of anti @-@ aircraft gunnery training . Shortly before 08 : 00 on the morning of 7 December , some crewmen aboard Utah observed the first Japanese planes approaching to attack Pearl Harbor , but they assumed they were American aircraft . The Japanese began their attack shortly thereafter , concentrating on the battleships moored around Ford Island . At 08 : 01 , the first of two torpedoes struck Utah , which caused serious flooding . The ship began to list to port and settle by the stern . As the crew began to abandon ship , one man — Chief Watertender Peter Tomich — remained below decks to ensure as many men as possible could escape , and to keep vital machinery running as long as possible ; he received the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions . 
 At 08 : 12 , Utah rolled over onto her side , while those crew members who had managed to escape swam to shore . Almost immediately after reaching shore , the ship 's captain , Commander Solomon <unk> , heard knocking from men trapped in the capsized ship . He called for volunteers to secure a cutting torch from the badly damaged cruiser Raleigh and attempt to free trapped men ; they succeeded in rescuing four men . In total , 64 officers and men were killed , though 461 survived . 
 = = = Salvage = = = 
 The Navy declared Utah to be " in ordinary " on 29 December , and she was placed under the authority of the Pearl Harbor Base Force . Following the successful righting ( rotation to upright ) of the capsized Oklahoma , an attempt was made to right the Utah by the same <unk> method using 17 winches . As Utah was rotated , she did not grip the harbor bottom , and slid towards Ford Island . The Utah recovery effort was abandoned , with Utah rotated 38 degrees from horizontal . 
 As abandoned , Utah cleared her berth . There was no further attempt to refloat her ; unlike the battleships sunk at Battleship Row , she had no military value . She was formally placed out of commission on 5 September 1944 , and then stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November . Utah received one battle star for her brief service during World War II . Her rusting hulk remains in Pearl Harbor , partially above water ; the men killed when Utah sank were never removed from the wreck , and as such , she is considered a war grave . 
 = = Memorial = = 
 In around 1950 , two memorials were placed at the wreck dedicated to the men in the ship 's crew who were killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor . The first is a plaque located on the wharf to the north of the ship , and the second is a plaque that was placed on the ship itself . In 1972 , a larger memorial was erected just off Ford Island , near the sunken wreck . The memorial consists of a 70 @-@ foot ( 21 m ) walkway made of white concrete , which extends from Ford Island out to a 40 by 15 ft ( 12 @.@ 2 by 4 @.@ 6 m ) platform in front of the ship , where a brass plaque and a flagpole are located . A color guard stands watch over the wreck . On 9 July 1988 , Utah and Arizona , the other remaining wreck in the harbor , were nominated to be added to the National Historic Landmark registry . Both wrecks were added to the list on 5 May 1989 . As of 2008 , seven former crewmen who were aboard Utah at the time of her sinking have been cremated and had their ashes interred in the wreck . 
 Relics from the ship are also preserved in the Utah state capitol building ; among the items on display are pieces from the ship 's silver service and the captain 's clock . The ship 's bell is on permanent display at the University of Utah near the entrance of the Naval Science Building .

 = Japanese cruiser Azuma = 
 Azuma ( <unk> ) ( sometimes transliterated ( archaically ) as <unk> ) was an armored cruiser built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) in the late 1890s . As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself , the ship was built in France . She participated in most of the naval battles of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 and was lightly damaged during the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima . Azuma began the first of five training cruises in 1912 and saw no combat during World War I. She was never formally reclassified as a training ship although she exclusively served in that role from 1921 until she was disarmed and hulked in 1941 . Azuma was badly damaged in an American carrier raid in 1945 , and subsequently scrapped in 1946 . 
 = = Background and design = = 
 The 1896 Naval Expansion Plan was made after the First Sino @-@ Japanese War , and included four armored cruisers in addition to four more battleships , all of which had to be ordered from overseas shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself . Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy . Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships , believing that the recent introduction of tougher Krupp cemented armor would allow them to stand in the line of battle . The revised plan is commonly known as the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " . The first four ships were built by Armstrong Whitworth in the United Kingdom , but the last two ships were built in Germany and France . To ensure ammunition compatibility , the IJN required their builders to use the same British guns as the other four ships . In general , the IJN provided only a sketch design and specifications that each builder had to comply with ; otherwise each builder was free to build the ships as they saw fit . Unlike most of their contemporaries which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes , Azuma and her half @-@ sisters were intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline . 
 = = Description = = 
 The ship was 137 @.@ 9 meters ( 452 ft 5 in ) long overall and 131 @.@ 56 meters ( 431 ft 8 in ) between perpendiculars . She had a beam of 17 @.@ 74 meters ( 58 ft 2 in ) and had an average draft of 7 @.@ 18 meters ( 23 ft 7 in ) . Azuma displaced 9 @,@ 278 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 131 long tons ) at normal load and 9 @,@ 953 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 796 long tons ) at deep load . The ship had a metacentric height of 0 @.@ 85 meters ( 2 ft 9 in ) . She had a double bottom and her hull was subdivided into 213 watertight compartments . Her crew consisted of 670 officers and enlisted men . 
 Azuma had two 4 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller shaft . Steam for the engines was provided by 24 Belleville boilers and the engines were rated at a total of 18 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 13 @,@ 000 kW ) . The ship had a designed speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . She carried up to 1 @,@ 200 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 200 long tons ; 1 @,@ 300 short tons ) of coal and could steam for 7 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 000 km ; 8 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main armament for all of the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " armored cruisers was four Armstrong Whitworth @-@ built 45 @-@ caliber eight @-@ inch guns in twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . The electrically operated turrets were capable of 130 ° rotation left and right , and the guns could be elevated to + 30 ° and depressed to − 5 ° . The turret accommodated 65 shells , but could only be reloaded through doors in the turret floor and the ship 's deck that allowed the electric winch in the turret to hoist shells up from the shell room deep in the hull . The guns were manually loaded and had a rate of fire about 1 @.@ 2 rounds per minute . The 203 @-@ millimeter gun fired 113 @.@ 5 @-@ kilogram ( 250 lb ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 760 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ) to a range of 18 @,@ 000 meters ( 20 @,@ 000 yd ) . 
 The secondary armament consisted of a dozen Elswick Ordnance Company " Pattern Z " quick @-@ firing ( QF ) , 40 @-@ caliber , 6 @-@ inch guns . All but four of these guns were mounted in armored casemates on the main and upper decks , and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by gun shields . Their 45 @.@ 4 @-@ kilogram ( 100 lb ) AP shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of 700 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ) . Azuma was also equipped with a dozen 40 @-@ caliber QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 @-@ cwt guns and eight QF 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder Yamauchi guns as close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats . The former gun fired 76 @-@ millimeter ( 3 in ) , 5 @.@ 7 @-@ kilogram ( 12 @.@ 5 lb ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 719 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 359 ft / s ) . 
 Azuma was equipped with five 457 mm ( 18 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , one above water in the bow and four submerged tubes , two on each broadside . The Type 30 torpedo had a 100 @-@ kilogram ( 220 lb ) warhead and three range / speed settings : 800 meters ( 870 yd ) at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) , 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) at 23 @.@ 6 knots ( 43 @.@ 7 km / h ; 27 @.@ 2 mph ) or 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 yd ) at 14 @.@ 2 knots ( 26 @.@ 3 km / h ; 16 @.@ 3 mph ) . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 All of the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences , one of which was that the four later ships all used Krupp cemented armor . The waterline belt ran the full length of the ship and its thickness varied from 178 millimeters ( 7 @.@ 0 in ) amidships to 89 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) at the bow and stern . It had a height of 2 @.@ 13 meters ( 7 ft 0 in ) , of which 1 @.@ 50 meters ( 4 ft 11 in ) was normally underwater . The upper strake of belt armor was 127 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck . It extended 61 @.@ 49 meters ( 201 ft 9 in ) from the forward to the rear barbette . Azuma had only a single transverse 76 mm armored bulkhead that closed off the forward end of the central armored citadel . 
 The barbettes , gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 152 millimeters thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by 51 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of armor . The deck was 63 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) thick and the armor protecting the conning tower was 356 millimeters ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) in thickness .

 The contract for Azuma , named after the Kantō region , was signed on 12 October 1897 with Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire , and the ship was laid down at their shipyard in Saint @-@ Nazaire on 1 February 1898 . She was launched on 24 June 1898 and completed on 29 July 1900 . Azuma left for Japan the next day and arrived in Yokosuka on 29 October . Captain Fujii Kōichi assumed command before the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War in February 1904 , until he was relieved in January 1905 by Captain Murakami Kakuichi . 
 = = = Russo @-@ Japanese War = = = 
 At the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Azuma was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet . She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 , when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser Boyarin , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six @-@ inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Although many ships on both sides were hit , Russian casualties numbered some 150 , while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged . 
 In early March , Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō was tasked to take the reinforced 2nd Division north and make a diversion off Vladivostok . While scouting for Russian ships in the area , the Japanese cruisers bombarded the harbor and defenses of Vladivostok on 6 March to little effect . Upon their return to Japan a few days later , the 2nd Division was ordered to escort the transports ferrying the Imperial Guards Division to Korea and then to join the ships blockading Port Arthur . Kamimura was ordered north in mid @-@ April to cover the Sea of Japan and defend the Korea Strait against any attempt by the Vladivostok Independent Cruiser Squadron , under the command of Rear Admiral Karl Jessen , to break through and unite with the Pacific Squadron . The two units narrowly missed each other on the 24th in heavy fog , and the Japanese proceeded to Vladivostok , where they laid several minefields before arriving back at Wonsan on the 30th . 
 The division failed to intercept the Russian squadron as it attacked several transports south of Okinoshima Island on 15 June , due to heavy rain and fog . The Russians sortied again on 30 June , and Kamimura finally was able to intercept them the next day near Okinoshima . The light was failing when they were spotted and the Russians were able to disengage in the darkness . Jessen 's ships sortied again on 17 July , headed for the eastern coast of Japan to act as a diversion and pull Japanese forces out of the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea . The Russian ships passed through Tsugaru Strait two days later and began capturing ships bound for Japan . The arrival of the Russians off Tokyo Bay on the 24th caused the Naval General Staff to order Kamimura to sail for Cape Toi Misaki , Kyūshū , fearing that Jessen would circumnavigate Japan to reach Port Arthur . Two days later he was ordered north to the Kii Channel and then to Tokyo Bay on the 28th . The General Staff finally ordered him back to Tsushima Island on the 30th ; later that day he received word that Jessen 's ships had passed through the Tsugaru Strait early that morning and reached Vladivostok on 1 August . 
 = = = = Battle off Ulsan = = = = 
 On 10 August , the ships at Port Arthur attempted a breakout to Vladivostok , but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea . Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them , but the order was delayed . His three armored cruisers , Rossia , Gromoboi , and Rurik , had to raise steam , so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August . By dawn he had reached Tsushima , but turned back when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron . 36 miles ( 58 km ) north of the island he encountered Kamimura 's squadron , which consisted of four modern armored cruisers , Iwate , Izumo , Tokiwa , and Azuma . The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting one another and each had reversed course around first light . This put the Japanese ships astride the Russian route to Vladivostok . 
 Jessen ordered his ships to turn to the northeast when he spotted the Japanese at 05 : 00 and they followed suit , albeit on a slightly converging course . Both sides opened fire around 05 : 23 at a range of 8 @,@ 500 meters ( 9 @,@ 300 yd ) . The Japanese ships concentrated their fire on Rurik , the rear ship of the Russian formation . She was hit fairly quickly and began to fall astern of the other two ships . Jessen turned southeast in an attempt to open the range , but this blinded the Russian gunners with the rising sun and prevented any of their broadside guns from bearing on the Japanese . About 06 : 00 , Jessen turned 180 ° to starboard in an attempt to reach the Korean coast and to allow Rurik to rejoin the squadron . Kamimura followed suit around 06 : 10 , but turned to port , which opened the range between the squadrons . Azuma then developed engine problems and the Japanese squadron slowed to conform with her best speed . Firing recommenced at 06 : 24 and Rurik was hit three times in the stern , flooding her steering compartment ; she had to be steered with her engines . Her speed continued to decrease , further exposing her to Japanese fire , and her steering jammed to port around 06 : 40 . 
 Jessen made another 180 ° turn in an attempt to interpose his two ships between the Japanese and Rurik , but the latter ship suddenly turned to starboard and increased speed and passed between Jessen 's ships and the Japanese . Kamimura turned 180 ° as well so that both squadrons were heading southeast on parallel courses , but Jessen quickly made another 180 ° turn so that they headed on opposing courses . The Russians reversed course for the third time around 07 : 45 in another attempt to support Rurik although Rossia was on fire herself ; her fires were extinguished about twenty minutes later . Kamimura circled Rurik to the south at 08 : 00 , then allowed the other two Russian ships to get to his north and gave them an uncontested route to Vladivostok . Despite this , Jessen turned back once more at 08 : 15 and ordered Rurik to make her own way back to Vladivostok before turning north at his maximum speed , about 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 About this time Kamimura 's two elderly protected cruisers , Naniwa and Takachiho , were approaching from the south . Their arrival allowed Kamimura to pursue Jessen with all of his armored cruisers while the two new arrivals dealt with Rurik . They fought a running battle with the Russians for the next hour and a half ; scoring enough hits on them to force their speed down to 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . Azuma 's engines again broke down during this chase and she was replaced in the line by Tokiwa . The Japanese closed to a minimum of about 5 @,@ 000 meters ( 5 @,@ 500 yd ) , but Kamimura then opened the range up to 6 @,@ 500 meters ( 7 @,@ 100 yd ) . 
 About 10 : 00 , Kamimura 's gunnery officer erroneously informed him that Izumo had expended three @-@ quarters of her ammunition , and he turned back after a five @-@ minute rapid @-@ fire barrage . He did not wish to leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik . By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho , which had closed to within 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 yd ) of Rurik in order to finish her off . They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk , but he did not receive the message . Shortly after the Japanese turned back , Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave @-@ to to make repairs . None of the Japanese ships were seriously damaged and Azuma only suffered eight men wounded during the battle . 
 On 30 December , Azuma and the armored cruiser Asama were ordered to patrol Tsugaru Strait to prevent any blockade runners from reaching Vladivostok . In mid @-@ February , Azuma was relieved by Iwate so the former could be refitted . 
 = = = = Battle of Tsushima = = = = 
 As the Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons approached Japan on 27 May , having sailed from the Baltic Sea , Yakumo was assigned to Kamimura 's 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet . The Russians were spotted by patrolling Japanese ships early that morning , but visibility was limited and radio reception poor . The preliminary reports were enough to cause Tōgō to order his ships to put to sea and the 2nd Division spotted the Russian ships under the command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky at around 11 : 30 . Kamimura closed to about a range of 8 @,@ 000 meters ( 8 @,@ 700 yd ) before sheering off under fire to join Tōgō 's battleships . Azuma was second of six when Tōgō opened fire on the 2nd Pacific Squadron at 14 : 10 and , unlike most of the ships in the division , initially engaged the battleship Knyaz Suvorov . At 14 : 50 , a 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) shell knocked out Azuma 's aft right 8 @-@ inch gun . By 15 : 00 , the Russian formation was in disorder and Knyaz Suvorov suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15 : 35 at a range of about 2 @,@ 000 meters ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . All of Kamimura 's ships engaged her for five minutes or so , with Azuma and the armored cruiser Yakumo also firing torpedoes at the Russian ship without effect . 
 After 17 : 30 Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers , leaving Tōgō 's battleships to their own devices . He abandoned his chase around 18 : 03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō . His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18 : 30 and opened fire when the range closed to 8 @,@ 000 – 9 @,@ 000 meters ( 8 @,@ 700 – 9 @,@ 800 yd ) . Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19 : 30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20 : 08 as night was falling . The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10 : 30 , staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply . Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range . Over the course of the entire battle , Azuma was struck by seven large shells , mostly 12 inch , four 6- and about four 75 @-@ millimeter shells . They inflicted only minor damage other than destroying one 6 @-@ inch and one 12 @-@ pounder gun mounts . 
 On 14 June , Azuma ( along with Yakumo , the armored cruisers Nisshin and Kasuga ) was assigned of the 3rd Fleet , under the command of Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> , for the capture of Sakhalin in July . 
 = = = Subsequent career = = = 
 Azuma was assigned to the Training Squadron on 20 April 1912 , where she conducted long @-@ distance oceanic navigation and officer training for cadets in the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy . From 5 December 1912 to 21 April 1913 , the ship accompanied the ex @-@ Russian protected cruiser Soya on a training cruise to Australia and Southeast Asia , the first of five overseas training cruises that she would make . Azuma was briefly relieved of her assignment from 1 May to 1 December before beginning another training cruise to North America and Hawaii , together with Asama , on 20 April – 11 August 1914 . The ship was again relieved of her assignment with the Training Squadron on 18 August , and was not reassigned until 1 September 1915 in preparation for her next training cruise that lasted from 20 April to 22 August 1916 , and visited Australia and Southeast Asia again . The next month she was relieved of her assignment and then became the flagship of Destroyer Squadron ( Suiraisentai ) 2 from 1 December 1916 to 28 March 1917 , and then again from 4 August to 24 January 1918 . In early 1917 , Azuma was dispatched on a diplomatic mission to return the body to the United States of George W. Guthrie , the Ambassador to Japan , who had died while in office . The ship rejoined the Training Squadron on 10 August 1918 , together with Tokiwa , and made her last two training cruises over the next two years . From 1 March to 26 July 1919 , the cruisers visited Australia and Southeast Asia and then the Mediterranean from 24 November to 20 May 1920 . Azuma left the Training Squadron on 6 June .

 On 1 September 1921 , the ship was re @-@ designated as a 1st @-@ class coast @-@ defense ship . By this time her engines were in bad shape and she became a training ship for the Maizuru Naval Corps a week later . In 1924 , four of Azuma 's 12 @-@ pounder guns were removed , as were all of her QF 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder guns , and a single 8 cm / 40 3rd Year Type anti @-@ aircraft gun was added . In addition three of her torpedo tubes were removed . On 1 October 1927 , she became a stationary training ship for the Maizuru engineering school . Azuma was refitted again in 1930 ; this included replacement of her boilers that reduced her horsepower to 9 @,@ 400 ihp ( 7 @,@ 000 kW ) and her speed to 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . Four each of her 6 @-@ inch and 12 @-@ pounder guns were removed during the refit . 
 Azuma was stricken from the navy list , hulked , and disarmed in 1941 . On 18 July 1945 , she was badly damaged by aircraft from the United States Navy TF @-@ 38 when they attacked Yokosuka . The ship was scrapped in 1946 .

 " The Sweetest Apu " is the nineteenth episode of The Simpsons ' thirteenth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 5 , 2002 . In the episode , Homer and his wife Marge discover that convenience store owner Apu is having an affair with the Squishee delivery lady working in his store . It is up to Marge , Homer and Apu to try to keep his wife Manjula from learning his secret . 
 " The Sweetest Apu " was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Matthew Nastuk . It features Inside the Actors Studio host James Lipton as himself . It also features references to The New Yorker , photographer Richard Avedon and the film Wild Wild West . In its original broadcast , the episode was seen by approximately 7 @.@ 1 million viewers and finished in <unk> place in the ratings the week it aired . Following its home video release on August 24 , 2010 , the episode received mostly negative reviews from critics . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Apu sells Homer a beer keg for the American Civil War reenactment of the Battle of Springfield . At the reenactment , Principal Skinner watches as Springfielders disobey him and hold a rather inaccurate battle ( featuring an orange plaid clad " East " faction , a roller skating Stone Wall Jackson , and a giant robotic spider made by Professor Frink ) . After the battle , Homer brings the empty , dented keg back to Apu at the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart in an attempt to get the deposit . There , he hears a giggle coming from a closet and finds Apu making love with the woman who delivers Squishees to Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart . He then walks backwards in shock all the way home to his bed and then dreams about walking backwards when he falls asleep . 
 Marge figures out what Homer saw from the movements of his pupil . They decide not to tell Manjula but while they are playing Badminton Homer and Marge act awkwardly with Manjula and Apu looking at them , trying not to give out hints Apu cheated on Manjula . They then confront Apu and he says he will break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette . However , he breaks his promise ( as it gets his mind off the <unk> ) . Later , Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating . To help get them together , Homer and Marge invite them both to dinner , but do not tell them that the other one is coming . After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa , Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change , but Manjula refuses to listen and demands a divorce . 
 Kicked out , Apu moves into the apartment complex where Kirk Van Houten lives . The <unk> then speak their first words , which put together , say " Mommy , will you let daddy come back ... cookie ! " Marge and Manjula go to Apu 's and arrive in time to prevent him from committing suicide by hanging . Apu is then subjected to several tasks to redeem himself ( such as eating a light bulb ) , though Manjula says it will take time for everything to get back to normal . In bed , Manjula , finally satisfied with what he has done , kisses Apu while Homer watches from the window , on a ladder . The couple continues and Homer , traumatized , hops backwards on the ladder all the way home , without falling , mimicking what he did earlier . 
 = = Production and cultural references = = 
 " The Sweetest Apu " was written by former Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder and directed by director Matthew Nastuk . It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 5 , 2002 . After seeing Apu cheating on Manjula with the <unk> girl , an extensive scene in which Homer dramatically backs out of the room , into the Simpson house and into his bed is shown . The scene was conceived by episode writer Swartzwelder . Another scene in the episode shows Apu breaking up with the Squishee lady in front of her house . Originally , police chief Clancy Wiggum would be seen in a robe inside the house , implying that other men in Springfield cheat on their wives as well , however it was dismissed because the writers thought it would look " too sad " . Originally , Swartzwelder wanted the <unk> sutra sex position in the episode to show several arms and legs " sticking out in crazy positions " , however it received a censor note and the Simpsons staff were allowed to show " less and less " of it as time progressed . 
 The episode features American writer and actor James Lipton , host of the television program Inside the Actors Studio , as himself . The divorce lawyer was portrayed by series regular voice actor Hank Azaria , and was based on " many lawyers that the writing staff had faced , " according to current show runner Al Jean . 
 Professor Frink 's steam @-@ powered " Super @-@ spider " seen during the reenactment is a reference to the 1999 steampunk film Wild Wild West . One of Apu 's promises to Manjula is to get a comic strip printed in The New Yorker . American photographer Richard Avedon is also mentioned in the episode . Another task is to star in a production of My Fair Lady with his children .

Al Jean , Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , Matt Selman , Tim Long , Dan Castellaneta , James Lipton and Matt Warburton participated in the audio commentary of the episode . 
 Following its home video release , " The Sweetest Apu " received mostly negative reviews from critics . DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson wrote " I don ’ t recall ever being particularly excited by other Manjula episodes , and ' Sweetest ' does nothing to alter that perception . " He praised Homer 's reaction to seeing Apu cheating on Manjula , but maintained that " much of the remaining gags tend to be lackluster . " He concluded by writing " This ends up as a pretty flat , forgettable show . " Project @-@ Blu 's Nate Boss called it " An average episode , by this season 's standards , " describing it as " a bit too cut and dry for my taste . " Writing for Blu @-@ ray.com , Casey Broadwater wrote that " The Sweetest Apu " is " near @-@ laughless " , and Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk wrote " The less said about this episode , the better . " Both reviewers considered the episode to be one of the season 's worst . On the other hand , giving the episode a positive review , Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B , praising the " Badminton [ scene ] and its many double entendres " as the episode 's " highlight " . 
 = Gastroenteritis = 
 Gastroenteritis , also known as infectious diarrhea , is inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that involves the stomach and small intestine . Signs and symptoms include some combination of diarrhea , vomiting , and abdominal pain . Fever , lack of energy , and dehydration may also occur . This typically lasts less than two weeks . It is unrelated to influenza though it has been called the stomach flu . 
 Gastroenteritis can be due to infections by viruses , bacteria , parasites , and fungus . The most common cause is viruses . In children rotavirus is the most common cause of severe disease . In adults , norovirus and Campylobacter are common . Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods , drinking contaminated water , or through close contact with an individual who is infected . Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed . 
 Prevention includes hand washing with soap , drinking clean water , proper disposal of human waste , and breastfeeding babies instead of using formula . The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children . Treatment involves getting enough fluids . For mild or moderate cases , this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution ( a combination of water , salts , and sugar ) . In those who are breast fed , continued breastfeeding is recommended . For more severe cases , intravenous fluids may be needed . Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube . Zinc supplementation is recommended in children . Antibiotics are generally not needed . 
 It is estimated that three to five billion cases of gastroenteritis resulting in 1 @.@ 4 million deaths occur globally each year . Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected . As of 2011 , in those below age five , there were about 1 @.@ 7 billion cases resulting in 0 @.@ 7 million deaths . In the developing world children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year . It is less common in adults , partly due to the development of immunity . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Gastroenteritis typically involves both diarrhea and vomiting , or less commonly , presents with only one or the other . Abdominal cramping may also be present . Signs and symptoms usually begin 12 – 72 hours after contracting the infectious agent . If due to a viral agent , the condition usually resolves within one week . Some viral causes may also be associated with fever , fatigue , headache , and muscle pain . If the stool is bloody , the cause is less likely to be viral and more likely to be bacterial . Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks . 
 Children infected with rotavirus usually make a full recovery within three to eight days . However , in poor countries treatment for severe infections is often out of reach and persistent diarrhea is common . Dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea , and a child with a significant degree of dehydration may have a prolonged capillary refill , poor skin turgor , and abnormal breathing . Repeat infections are typically seen in areas with poor sanitation , and malnutrition , stunted growth , and long @-@ term cognitive delays can result . 
 Reactive arthritis occurs in 1 % of people following infections with Campylobacter species , and Guillain @-@ Barre syndrome occurs in 0 @.@ 1 % . <unk> uremic syndrome ( HUS ) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin @-@ producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species , causing low platelet counts , poor kidney function , and low red blood cell count ( due to their breakdown ) . Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults . Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures . 
 = = Cause = = 
 Viruses ( particularly rotavirus ) and the bacteria Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species are the primary causes of gastroenteritis . There are , however , many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome . Non @-@ infectious causes are seen on occasion , but they are less likely than a viral or bacterial cause . Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene . 
 = = = Viral = = = 
 Rotavirus , norovirus , adenovirus , and <unk> are known to cause viral gastroenteritis . Rotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children , and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world . Viruses cause about 70 % of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group . Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity . Norovirus is the cause in about 18 % of all cases . 
 Norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis among adults in America , causing greater than 90 % of outbreaks . These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other , such as on cruise ships , in hospitals , or in restaurants . People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended . Norovirus is the cause of about 10 % of cases in children . 
 = = = Bacterial = = = 
 In the developed world Campylobacter jejuni is the primary cause of bacterial gastroenteritis , with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry . In children , bacteria are the cause in about 15 % of cases , with the most common types being Escherichia coli , Salmonella , Shigella , and Campylobacter species . If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours , the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food . Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat , poultry , seafood , and eggs ; raw sprouts ; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses ; and fruit and vegetable juices . In the developing world , especially sub @-@ Saharan Africa and Asia , cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis . This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food . 
 <unk> Clostridium difficile is an important cause of diarrhea that occurs more often in the elderly . Infants can carry these bacteria without developing symptoms . It is a common cause of diarrhea in those who are hospitalized and is frequently associated with antibiotic use . Staphylococcus aureus infectious diarrhea may also occur in those who have used antibiotics . Acute " traveler 's diarrhea " is usually a type of bacterial gastroenteritis , while the persistent form is usually parasitic . Acid @-@ suppressing medication appears to increase the risk of significant infection after exposure to a number of organisms , including Clostridium difficile , Salmonella , and Campylobacter species . The risk is greater in those taking proton pump inhibitors than with H2 antagonists . 
 = = = Parasitic = = = 
 A number of protozoa can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia <unk> – but Entamoeba histolytica , Cryptosporidium spp . , and other species have also been implicated . As a group , these agents comprise about 10 % of cases in children . Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world , but this <unk> agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere . It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence , children who attend day care , men who have sex with men , and following disasters . 
 = = = Transmission = = = 
 Transmission may occur via consumption of contaminated water , or when people share personal objects . In places with wet and dry seasons , water quality typically worsens during the wet season , and this correlates with the time of outbreaks . In areas of the world with four seasons , infections are more common in the winter . Bottle @-@ feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause on a global scale . Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene , especially among children , in crowded households , and in those with pre @-@ existing poor nutritional status . After developing tolerance , adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting signs or symptoms , and thus act as natural reservoirs of contagion . While some agents ( such as Shigella ) only occur in primates , others may occur in a wide variety of animals ( such as Giardia ) . 
 = = = Non @-@ infectious = = = 
 There are a number of non @-@ infectious causes of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract . Some of the more common include medications ( like NSAIDs ) , certain foods such as lactose ( in those who are intolerant ) , and gluten ( in those with celiac disease ) . Crohn 's disease is also a non @-@ infectious source of ( often severe ) gastroenteritis . Disease secondary to toxins may also occur . Some food @-@ related conditions associated with nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea include : ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish , <unk> associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish , tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others , and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food . 
 In the United States , rates of emergency department use for noninfectious gastroenteritis dropped 30 % from 2006 until 2011 . Of the twenty most common conditions seen in the emergency department , rates of noninfectious gastroenteritis had the largest decrease in visits in that time period . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Gastroenteritis is defined as vomiting or diarrhea due to infection of the small or large bowel . The changes in the small bowel are typically <unk> , while the ones in the large bowel are inflammatory . The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one ( for Cryptosporidium ) to as many as 108 ( for Vibrio cholerae ) . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically , based on a person 's signs and symptoms . Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter management of the condition . However , stool cultures should be performed in those with blood in the stool , those who might have been exposed to food poisoning , and those who have recently traveled to the developing world . Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance . As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10 % of infants and young children , measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended . Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration . 
 = = = Dehydration = = = 
 A determination of whether or not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment , with dehydration typically divided into mild ( 3 – 5 % ) , moderate ( 6 – 9 % ) , and severe ( ≥ 10 % ) cases . In children , the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill , poor skin turgor , and abnormal breathing . Other useful findings ( when used in combination ) include sunken eyes , decreased activity , a lack of tears , and a dry mouth . A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring . Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration . Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed . 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis , volvulus , inflammatory bowel disease , urinary tract infections , and diabetes mellitus . Pancreatic insufficiency , short bowel syndrome , Whipple 's disease , coeliac disease , and laxative abuse should also be considered . The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea ( rather than both ) . 
 <unk> may present with vomiting , abdominal pain , and a small amount of diarrhea in up to 33 % of cases . This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis . Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea . Classical diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) presents with abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting , but without diarrhea . One study found that 17 % of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 = = = Lifestyle = = = 
 A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis . Personal measures ( such as hand washing with soap ) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30 % . Alcohol @-@ based gels may also be effective . Breastfeeding is important , especially in places with poor hygiene , as is improvement of hygiene generally . Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration . Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective . 
 = = = Vaccination = = = 
 Due to both its effectiveness and safety , in 2009 the World Health Organization recommended that the rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally . Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development . In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen a decline in the rates and severity of disease . This vaccine may also prevent illness in non @-@ vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections . Since 2000 , the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent . The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age . The oral cholera vaccine has been found to be 50 – 60 % effective over 2 years . 
 = = Management = = 
 Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self @-@ limiting disease that does not require medication . The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy ( ORT ) . Metoclopramide and / or ondansetron , however , may be helpful in some children , and <unk> is useful in treating abdominal pain . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The primary treatment of gastroenteritis in both children and adults is rehydration . This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution , although intravenous delivery may be required if there is a decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe . Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates ( i.e. those made from wheat or rice ) may be superior to those based on simple sugars . Drinks especially high in simple sugars , such as soft drinks and fruit juices , are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea . Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them . A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted . In those who require intravenous fluids , one to four hours ' worth is often sufficient . 
 = = = Dietary = = = 
 It is recommended that breast @-@ fed infants continue to be nursed in the usual fashion , and that formula @-@ fed infants continue their formula immediately after rehydration with ORT . Lactose @-@ free or lactose @-@ reduced formulas usually are not necessary . Children should continue their usual diet during episodes of diarrhea with the exception that foods high in simple sugars should be avoided . The <unk> diet ( bananas , rice , applesauce , toast and tea ) is no longer recommended , as it contains insufficient nutrients and has no benefit over normal feeding . Some probiotics have been shown to be beneficial in reducing both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools . They may also be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea . Fermented milk products ( such as yogurt ) are similarly beneficial . Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Antiemetic medications may be helpful for treating vomiting in children . <unk> has some utility , with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids , fewer hospitalizations , and decreased vomiting . Metoclopramide might also be helpful . However , the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children . The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants . <unk> , while reducing vomiting , does not appear to have a significant clinical benefit . 
 = = = Antibiotics = = = 
 Antibiotics are not usually used for gastroenteritis , although they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected . If antibiotics are to be employed , a macrolide ( such as azithromycin ) is preferred over a <unk> due to higher rates of resistance to the latter . <unk> colitis , usually caused by antibiotic use , is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin . Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi , and Giardia species . In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica , <unk> treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever . 
 = = = <unk> agents = = = 
 <unk> medication has a theoretical risk of causing complications , and although clinical experience has shown this to be unlikely , these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever . <unk> , an opioid analogue , is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea . <unk> is not recommended in children , however , as it may cross the immature blood – brain barrier and cause toxicity . Bismuth subsalicylate , an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate , can be used in mild to moderate cases , but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 It is estimated that three to five billion cases of gastroenteritis resulting in 1 @.@ 4 million deaths occur globally on an annual basis . Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected . As of 2011 , in those less than five , there were about 1 @.@ 7 billion cases resulting in 0 @.@ 7 million deaths , with most of these occurring in the world 's poorest nations . More than 450 @,@ 000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5 years of age . Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100 @,@ 000 people yearly . In the developing world , children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis . It is less common in adults , partly due to the development of acquired immunity . 
 In 1980 , gastroenteritis from all causes caused 4 @.@ 6 million deaths in children , with the majority occurring in the developing world . Death rates were reduced significantly ( to approximately 1 @.@ 5 million deaths annually ) by the year 2000 , largely due to the introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy . In the US , infections causing gastroenteritis are the second most common infection ( after the common cold ) , and they result in between 200 and 375 million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually , with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age . 
 = = History = = 
 The first usage of " gastroenteritis " was in 1825 . Before this time it was commonly known as typhoid fever or " cholera morbus " , among others , or less specifically as " griping of the guts " , " surfeit " , " flux " , " colic " , " bowel complaint " , or any one of a number of other archaic names for acute diarrhea . Cholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically cholera . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 Gastroenteritis is associated with many colloquial names , including " Montezuma 's revenge " , " Delhi belly " , " la <unk> " , and " back door sprint " , among others . It has played a role in many military campaigns and is believed to be the origin of the term " no guts no glory " . 
 Gastroenteritis is the main reason for 3 @.@ 7 million visits to physicians a year in the United States and 3 million visits in France . In the United States gastroenteritis as a whole is believed to result in costs of 23 billion USD per year with that due to rotavirus alone resulting in estimated costs of 1 billion USD a year .

 Many of the same agents cause gastroenteritis in cats and dogs as in humans . The most common organisms are Campylobacter , Clostridium difficile , Clostridium <unk> , and Salmonella . A large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms . 
 Some agents are more specific to a certain species . <unk> gastroenteritis coronavirus ( <unk> ) occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting , diarrhea , and dehydration . It is believed to be introduced to pigs by wild birds and there is no specific treatment available . It is not transmissible to humans . 
 = Djungarian hamster = 
 The Djungarian hamster ( Phodopus sungorus ) , also known as the Siberian hamster , Siberian dwarf hamster or Russian winter white dwarf hamster , is one of three species of hamster in the genus Phodopus . It is ball @-@ shaped and typically half the size of the Syrian hamster , and therefore called a dwarf hamster along with all Phodopus species . Features of the Djungarian hamster include a typically thick , dark grey dorsal stripe and furry feet . As winter approaches and the days shorten , the Djungarian hamster 's dark fur is almost entirely replaced with white fur . In captivity , this does not always happen . In the wild , they originate from Dzungaria , the wheat fields of Kazakhstan , the meadows of Mongolia , Siberia , and the birch stands of Manchuria . 
 Djungarian hamsters are common as pets in Europe and North America , and exhibit greater variance in their coats than those found in the wild . They reproduce often — more so than Syrian hamsters — and , as they have no fixed breeding season , can continue to produce large amounts of offspring all year round . Young pups will act aggressively to one another ; whilst breeding females may show similar aggression to males . 
 = = Physical description = = 
 The coat of the Djungarian hamster is less woolly than that of the Campbell 's dwarf hamster , and apart from the normal colouring , they can be coloured sapphire , sapphire pearl , or normal pearl . The head length of the Djungarian hamster is 70 to 90 millimetres in length , the length of the tail is five to 15 millimetres , and the hind legs are 11 to 15 millimetres . The body weight changes dramatically throughout the year . It is at its lowest during the winter months . In males , the body weight ranges from 19 grams ( 0 @.@ 67 oz ) to 45 grams ( 1 @.@ 6 oz ) , and in females , 19 grams ( 0 @.@ 67 oz ) to 36 grams ( 1 @.@ 3 oz ) . In human care , they are slightly heavier . The average lifespan of the Djungarian hamster is one to three years of age in captivity , though they can live longer . In the wild , they are known to live as little as one year . 
 In summer , the fur of the Djungarian hamster on the back changes from ash @-@ grey to dark brown , or sometimes pale brown with a tint . The face changes to grey or brown , while the mouth area , the whisker area and the ears are slightly brighter . The outer ears and the eyes have black edges . The rest of the head is dark brown or black . From the head to the tail runs a black @-@ brown dorsal stripe . The throat , belly , tail and limbs are white . The ears are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs . The hairs on the underside are completely white . The bright coat the bottom extends to the shoulders , flanks and hips in three arches upward . It is distinguished from the darker fur on the top of the existing black @-@ brown hair , three curved line . 
 Apart from the typical colouration , Djungarian hamsters can also be coloured pearl , sapphire , sapphire pearl and marbled . Other colorations are available , but these are strongly suspected to appear only in hybrid crossings with Campbell Dwarf hamsters . Some of these colorations are mandarin , blue , <unk> , yellow blue fawn , camel , brown , cream , merle and <unk> . 
 In the winter , the fur is more dense . They sometimes have a grey tint on their head . More than ten percent of the hamsters kept in the first winter develop the summer coat . In the second winter , only a few change into the winter coat and winter colour is less pronounced . The moulting in the winter fur starts in October or November and is completed in December , while the summer coat begins in January or February and is completed in March or early April . The ears are grey with a pinkish tint . Moulting both run jobs on the head and the back of the spine to the sides , the legs and the underside . The hairs grow longer in the summer , to about ten millimetres long . 
 The pigmentation of hair is controlled by the hormone prolactin and colour genetics . Day length must be less than fourteen hours to initiate the change to winter coat . The change to the winter coat can be triggered in the summer by the short day lengths . The change occurs back to the summer coat in the autumn , when the length of the days change again . At internal temperatures hamsters in captivity start later with the changes . The winter colour is less pronounced in them . The eyes of the Djungarian hamster are black , unless it is albino in which case they are red . 
 = = In the wild = = 
 In the wild , the Djungarian hamster 's fur changes colour in the winter . This adaptation helps them to evade predators in the snow @-@ covered steppes of winter . The Djungarian hamster digs tunnels one metre deep leading to ground burrows where they can sleep , raise their young and hide from predators . The weasel is one of the Djungarian hamsters main predators . Most of these burrows have six entrances . In the summer time , the burrows are lined with moss . To keep the burrow warm in the winter , the Djungarian hamster closes all but one entrance and lines the burrows with animal fur or wool that it finds . The temperature inside the burrow is usually 16 @.@ 7 ° C ( 62 @.@ 1 ° F ) . Djungarian hamsters sometimes live in the semi @-@ deserts in Central Asia . They also live in the dry steppes and wheat or alfalfa fields as well as on small fields in the forests of the region around <unk> . The fur on the Djungarian hamster 's feet protect the feet from the cold ground from in the cold climates in the wild . The population density is highly varied . In 1968 , the first four examples of the Djungarian hamster were caught in Western Siberia and brought to the Max Planck Institute in Germany . 
 = = = Systematics = = = 
 The Djungarian hamster is a species of Phodopus . The Campbell 's Dwarf Hamster is named as a separate species within the Phodopus sungorus species with respect to subspecies . Other subspecies are not distinguished . The Djungarian hamster was described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1773 as a mouse . The species name sungorus derives from the <unk> . In 1778 , Pallas renamed the Djungarian hamster to mouse <unk> . Ned Hollister ordered the Djungarian hamster in 1912 to the genus Phodopus . A. I. <unk> , in 1933 , changed the name to priority sungorus and united the Djungarian hamster as a subspecies of Phodopus sungorus sungorus with the Campbell 's Dwarf Hamster .

 Djungarian hamsters are often found on the pet market in Europe and North America . Care of the Djungarian hamster is similar to all other species of Phodopus . Djungarian hamsters , along with most rodents , are prone to tumours . They can also receive injury in the cheek pouch by sharp objects damaging the fragile inner lining . Other health problems include bite wounds , broken teeth , constipation , dehydration , dental <unk> , diarrhea and ear problems . The Djungarian hamster is easy to tame . In addition to natural colourings in the wild , ( " ruddy " or " agouti " ) Djungarian hamsters in captivity come in a variety of different colors . 
 = = Breeding = = 
 Djungarian hamsters reproduce at a faster rate than Syrian hamsters . Phodopus are able to become pregnant again on the same day that they have given birth . This can all happen within a thirty @-@ six @-@ day period . This is done as a survival strategy to produce large numbers of offspring in a short period of time . This places tremendous demands on the mother . Research suggests biparental care in Campbell 's hamsters ( Phodopus campbelli ) but not in Djungarian hamsters ( Phodopus sungorus ) . Frequent fighting can occur between the pups and as soon as they are weaned from their mother , they are separated from their mother . They should not be separated from their mother before three weeks of age . Most Djungarian hamster dwarf hamsters grow to 3 to 4 " long . Djungarian hamsters breed all year round as there is no specific breeding season . 
 During the breeding time , the Djungarian hamster may become aggressive . After mating , the female may want to attack the male to protect her babies . The male will usually hide in holes or caves to escape from the vicious bite of the female Djungarian hamster . The Djungarian hamster 's estrous cycle lasts four days , this means every four days , the female may accept the male back to breed again . This usually occurs when the darkness of the evening sets in . If a male and female Djungarian hamster are not housed together from a young age , it is difficult to tell if the female is willing to breed with the male . 
 = = = Hybrids = = = 
 Of the five species kept commonly as pets , only the Campbell 's dwarf hamster and Djungarian hamsters are able to interbreed and produce live offspring or hybrids . Although hybrids make suitable pets , the breeding of hybrids and cloning can cause health and reproduction problems . In addition , the widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of the ecosystem , resulting in only mongrels . <unk> causes each litter to become smaller and the young begin to form congenital problems .

 William Edwin " Bill " Spivey ( March 19 , 1929 – May 8 , 1995 ) was an American basketball player . A 7 ft 0 in ( 2 @.@ 13 m ) center , he played college basketball for the National Collegiate Athletic Association 's ( NCAA ) Kentucky Wildcats from 1949 to 1951 . After his high school career , Spivey was recruited to the University of Kentucky . During his time with the Wildcats , he led the team to the 1951 NCAA Tournament championship , and was voted Most Outstanding Player of the event . When a point shaving scandal was revealed that year , Spivey was accused of being involved , which he denied . He left the Wildcats in December 1951 , and the university banned him from the squad in March 1952 . 
 After he testified before a grand jury in New York , he was indicted on perjury charges . Although Spivey was not convicted when the case went to trial in 1953 , he was prevented from competing in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) afterward . Spivey instead played professionally for various minor league teams . In 10 Eastern Basketball League ( EBL ) seasons , his teams won three championships . Spivey retired in 1968 and became a businessman , working in sales and operating restaurants . Upset by the accusations against him in the early 1950s , he was reclusive in his final years . 
 = = Early life = = 
 William Edwin Spivey was born in Lakeland , Florida , and had moved to Columbus , Georgia , by 1944 , at which time he was 6 ft 9 in ( 2 @.@ 06 m ) . After taking up basketball , he played for his high school 's team and had 18 points in his first half of game action . The following year , he moved to Warner Robins , Georgia , which did not have a basketball team before he arrived . The principal of Warner Robins ' high school created a team , however , once Spivey came . During one of his high school seasons , he was forced to play without shoes — since none of the school 's shoes fit him — and wear three pairs of socks . Spivey had over 1 @,@ 800 points in his three @-@ year high school career .

 Several universities wanted to give Spivey a basketball scholarship in 1948 . The University of Kentucky first became aware of Spivey when a Georgia newspaper publisher phoned Fred Wachs , whom writer Earl Cox called " the most powerful man in Lexington " ; according to Cox , Wachs " ran the University of Kentucky " . After hearing of Spivey from the publisher , who indicated a desire to have him attend the university , Wachs notified Kentucky 's men 's basketball coach , Adolph Rupp , who elected to have a scout watch Spivey play . Following positive feedback from the scout , Rupp gave Spivey an invitation to a camp held at Alumni Gymnasium , where he would try out against other leading high school seniors . He received a scholarship on the camp 's first day , one of two players to do so . 
 = = = 1948 – 49 to 1949 – 50 = = = 
 Even though he offered a scholarship to the seven @-@ foot Spivey , Rupp was concerned about his weight , which was between 160 and 165 pounds . Rupp told him that he would play only if he added 40 pounds ( 18 kg ) , and Spivey bulked up to 200 pounds ( 91 kg ) during the summer of 1948 . At the time , first @-@ year players were not allowed to compete on varsity teams . Therefore , Spivey spent his first year at Kentucky on a freshman team , while the varsity team won its second consecutive NCAA Basketball Championship in 1949 . The two teams practiced against each other , and varsity team member Ralph Beard later said that Spivey outplayed the Wildcats ' All @-@ American center , Alex Groza . The U.S. Olympic team , which had six Wildcats players on it , practiced in Lexington , and Spivey gained knowledge and skills from team members Groza , Vince Boryla and Bob Kurland . Spivey also competed in games against other freshman teams , including one against Xavier in which he posted 31 points . In 15 games , he averaged about 20 points per game . 
 In the 1949 – 50 season , the Wildcats lost several of the leading players from their championship @-@ winning teams to graduation , including Beard and Groza . In response , Rupp made Spivey the focal point of the team , and the team exceeded expectations . In a February 18 , 1950 game against Georgia Tech , which the Wildcats won 97 – 62 , Spivey broke the team record for points in a game with 40 , two more than Groza scored in a game the previous season . That record has since been broken , but his 42 field goal attempts remain a school record as of 2010 . Spivey tied another of Groza 's point @-@ scoring records on March 5 with a 37 @-@ point performance in a Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) Men 's Basketball Tournament game . Kentucky won over Tennessee 95 – 58 to win the SEC Tournament for the seventh consecutive season . Kentucky ended the regular season with a 25 – 4 record , and Spivey averaged 19 @.@ 4 points a game . Despite the Wildcats ' record and SEC title , the NCAA Tournament selection committee did not give the team a berth in the 1950 tournament . Kentucky did gain a berth to the National Invitation Tournament , but was eliminated in the quarterfinals by City College of New York ( CCNY ) , 89 – 50 . In that game , Spivey was forced to the bench for the final nine minutes of the first half after accumulating four personal fouls . At the end of the season , Spivey was named to the All @-@ SEC team , and the Associated Press selected him for its 1950 All @-@ American third team . 
 = = = 1950 – 51 = = = 
 Spivey set another school record in a February 13 , 1951 , game , gathering 31 rebounds . As of 2010 , he remains tied for the team record with Bob Burrow , who had the same number of rebounds in a 1955 game . For the season , Spivey again averaged more than 19 points per game , and he added 17 @.@ 2 rebounds per game . His point total led the SEC , and his 479 regular season points were the third @-@ most in league history at the time . The Wildcats had a 28 – 2 record during the regular season , and entered the postseason as the top @-@ ranked team in the country . One of those losses came in the SEC Tournament against Vanderbilt , but it did not affect the team 's prospects for an NCAA Tournament berth because the SEC had decided to send its regular season champion to the newly expanded 16 @-@ team tournament . Kentucky advanced to the Tournament 's Final Four , where Spivey had 28 points and 16 rebounds in a 76 – 74 win over Illinois . The Wildcats then faced Kansas State in the NCAA championship game . Despite falling behind early in the contest , they took the lead in the second half and pulled away to win 68 – 58 . Spivey played an important role in the victory , scoring 22 points and pulling down 21 rebounds . Rupp said after the game that " Spivey made the difference after he went to work . " For his performance in the Final Four , Spivey was named the event 's Most Outstanding Player . He was later selected to the 1951 All @-@ American team , as well as the All @-@ SEC team for the second straight season . 
 = = <unk> in gambling scandal = = 
 The CCNY Point Shaving Scandal was revealed in 1951 . A series of college basketball players had conspired with gamblers to shave points to ensure that their teams lost against the point spread . According to Manhattan District Attorney Frank Hogan , 32 players were involved in point shaving or match fixing , and 86 games were affected . That figure included three ex @-@ Kentucky players : Dale Barnstable , Beard , and Groza , who engaged in point shaving during a 1949 National Invitation Tournament game . Having been sidelined in the early part of the 1951 – 52 season after knee surgery , Spivey gave up his eligibility to play for the Wildcats on December 24 , 1951 . He denied rumors that he was involved in the scandal , calling them " false and malicious " . 
 Spivey intended to return to the Wildcats once the situation was resolved , which Kentucky 's athletic association expected before reinstatement . On February 16 , 1952 , he and the association 's directors agreed to have him testify before a grand jury in New York . After Spivey 's grand jury appearance later in February , however , the university banned him permanently on March 2 . In its statement , Kentucky 's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament . Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players , Spivey and Walter Hirsch , to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament 's games , and eventually pleaded guilty . In his grand jury testimony , Spivey denied receiving $ 1 @,@ 000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951 , or talking about doing so with gamblers . In April , the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for lying under oath during his testimony , claiming he had done so on seven occasions . 
 = = = Trial = = = 
 On June 9 , Spivey was arrested in New York , and was released pending a trial , which started in January 1953 . Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point <unk> , and was upset that the payment for his role in shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated . This , however , contradicted his original grand jury testimony , which had no mention of Spivey 's involvement . Hirsch also told the grand jury that Spivey and West , the ringleader , had not met . West declined to testify , leading to criminal contempt charges against him . Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal , stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions . According to him , ex @-@ teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury ; Spivey said he learned this from Line . The trial lasted for 13 days before the case went to a jury . By a 9 – 3 margin , the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey , and the hung jury caused a mistrial . The grand jury eventually dropped the charges against Spivey .

 Although Spivey was not found guilty in the scandal , he found himself blackballed from the NBA after league president Maurice Podoloff banned all 32 players involved in the CCNY scandal for life . The Cincinnati Royals later tried to sign Spivey , but Podoloff refused to approve the contract . Spivey filed a lawsuit against the NBA and Podoloff in 1960 , seeking more than $ 800 @,@ 000 in damages . Afterward , he claimed that his rights under the Sherman Antitrust Act had been violated and sued the league in federal court , dropping his initial case . In response , Podoloff offered to settle with Spivey for $ 10 @,@ 000 , which he accepted . According to sportswriter Jim Murray , Spivey felt that he had no choice but to accept because the court schedule was so full that even if he had won his case , he would have been too old to be a viable NBA prospect in any case . Future Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall said that " most people feel [ Spivey ] would have been one of the top five centers of all @-@ time had he had the chance to mature in the NBA . " Instead , Spivey spent his professional career playing for numerous minor league and barnstorming teams . 
 In October 1952 , Spivey played in two games for the American Basketball League 's Elmira Colonels , scoring 21 and 32 points in the contests . That season , he also was a member of the Detroit Vagabonds barnstorming team . For the next three seasons , he spent time with three teams connected to the Harlem Globetrotters exhibition team : the Boston Whirlwinds , the House of David , and the Washington Generals . In one game with the Whirlwinds , Spivey got into a fight with Globetrotters player Bobby " Showboat " Hall . For the 1955 – 56 and 1956 – 57 seasons , Spivey played for another barnstorming team , the New York Olympians , later renamed the Kentucky Colonels . 
 Beginning with the 1957 – 58 season , Spivey spent 10 of his remaining 12 professional seasons in the EBL . The first two of those EBL seasons were spent with the Wilkes @-@ Barre Barons , and Spivey led the team to consecutive league championships . On April 20 , 1958 , he scored 62 points in the title @-@ clinching game against the Easton <unk> , setting an EBL playoff record . In 1958 – 59 , he became the first player in league history with a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ point season , and had 64 points in a March 1959 game . Along with his play in the EBL , Spivey reached an agreement to join the Ansonia <unk> of the semi @-@ professional Connecticut Basketball Association ( CBA ) in 1958 . Over two years with the <unk> , his points @-@ per @-@ game average exceeded 30 @.@ 0 . Spivey moved to the Baltimore Bullets for the 1959 – 60 season , and played two seasons for the club . In Spivey 's first season with the Bullets , he had 36 @.@ 3 points per game , the highest average of his EBL career . Outside EBL competition , he received an opportunity to play opposite leading NBA center Wilt Chamberlain in a 1960 exhibition game , held in Milford , Connecticut , against the CBA 's Milford Chiefs . Spivey had a 30 @-@ point , 23 @-@ rebound performance ; his statistics were comparable to those of Chamberlain , who recorded a 31 @-@ point , 27 @-@ rebound game . 
 The Bullets won the league championship in 1960 – 61 , after which Spivey played two seasons in a different American Basketball League , with the Los Angeles Jets and Long Beach – Hawaii Chiefs . Spivey was named to the 1961 – 62 All @-@ ABL Second Team after averaging 22 @.@ 7 points per game and 11 @.@ 2 rebounds per game with the Chiefs ; his total of 1 @,@ 773 points was second behind Connie Hawkins . In the 1962 – 63 season , which was shortened when the league suspended operations , he had an average of 22 @.@ 5 points per game in 24 games with Long Beach . In ABL history , Spivey was third in points scored and fourth in rebounds . 
 Spivey returned to the EBL in 1963 to join the Scranton Miners , for whom he played five seasons . His highest scoring average for the Miners came in the 1964 – 65 season , when he had 27 @.@ 0 points per game . In 1967 – 68 , his final professional season , Spivey went back to the Barons . Playing for about $ 200 in salary per contest , he had 10 @.@ 4 points per game . On February 11 , 1968 , Spivey participated in his final professional game . Taking advantage of a loophole in the NBA 's rules , he took part in an all @-@ star game in Baltimore featuring former Baltimore Bullets players before a Bullets – San Diego Rockets game . Spivey led both teams by scoring 12 points , but his team lost by one point . One day later he retired , saying " It really meant something for me to finish off my career with a game like that . " By the end of his career , Spivey 's physical condition had declined ; Lou <unk> , who had played with him at Kentucky , said , " He was just completely disabled . He could barely walk . "

 After retiring from basketball , Spivey became a businessman , and moved back to Kentucky . The majority of his jobs involved sales ; these included the selling of building materials and insurance . He also helped to develop real estate and owned restaurants , including a Lexington @-@ based eatery , Bill Spivey 's Restaurant and Lounge . For a time he was the state 's deputy insurance commissioner . Spivey ran in the primary election for Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky in 1983 as a Democrat , but came in last in the seven @-@ person race . 
 Spivey made his final public appearance in 1991 , at a reunion of the 1951 Kentucky Wildcats team in Lexington . Writer Greg <unk> says that " he was a recluse " at the time . According to his wife , Audrey Spivey , " He never got over [ his accusation in the 1951 college basketball scandal ] . Bill could not let that go . He was just devastated . " Then living in Daytona Beach , Florida , he was later hurt in an automobile accident , which aggravated a lower @-@ back injury . Spivey 's son , <unk> , said that " He never made a full recovery from that . It affected his posture , and he had chronic pain from that . " In a post @-@ accident bone grafting operation , a piece of equipment became lodged in Spivey 's lower back ; according to <unk> , he won a small amount from the hospital in a lawsuit . 
 Spivey moved to Quepos , Costa Rica , around 1993 , after vacationing there with a friend six months before . Audrey did not come with him , although the couple did not separate legally . On May 8 , 1995 , he was found dead of natural causes at the age of 66 . Spivey received two notable honors posthumously : his jersey number , 77 , was retired by the University of Kentucky in January 2000 , and the Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame inducted him in September 2004 .

 The accompanying music video for " Because of You " was directed by Vadim Perelman and was produced by Rhonda Vernet . Clarkson wrote the treatment for the video herself in order to reflect the pain that she felt due to her parents ' divorce . Nevertheless , Clarkson also allowed Perelman to take control of the production of the video . According to Perelman , he wanted to create a disconnection to show " that this kind of dysfunctional family can exist anywhere . " In an interview with MTV News , Clarkson confessed that the video is sad , rationalizing , " It 's a sad song , so the video obviously has to follow that . But it ends really happy and everything and the family , my family , ends up breaking the cycle of my parents . " Since the music video deals specifically with her parents ' divorce , Clarkson had to seek for her parents ' permission . She explained , 
 " It 's very close to home [ for me ] . I OK 'd it with my family and everything because they think it 's important , because we 're obviously very different now than we were when we were younger . And it 's important for people to see that raw kind of emotion that happens in life . It sucks sometimes , so it 's important to see that I think . And that 's what we 're portraying in the video .

 In the video , the younger version of Clarkson is played by Kennedy <unk> , the daughter of her musical director , Jason Halbert . The video premiered on October 3 , 2005 , on Total Request Live . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The video starts at the Clarksons ' household . There , she and her husband are engaged in a heated argument and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point . Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile ; Clarkson , however , is immune to this . Looking around her house , she sees her younger self . Hand in hand , the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone and Clarkson 's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father 's dinner into the bin . These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson 's face so that she doesn 't see her starting to cry . The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson 's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other . Soon after , Clarkson 's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson 's pleas for him to stay . The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present and instead of fighting with her husband , they make up . They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight , and they embrace her and each other .

 Elizabeth Black of VH1 ranked the music video at number four in her list of " Five Emotive Music Video Performances . " She reasoned , " Kelly Clarkson practically sobs her way through this hurt and angry expression of the pain that the narrator ’ s father has caused her through his absence and lack of love . " The music video won the category of Best Female Video at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards . This marks the second time Clarkson has won the same category two years in a row ; her first win in the category was at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards for the music video of " Since U Been Gone . " The music video was also nominated in the category of Viewer 's Choice Award , but lost to Fall Out Boy 's " Dance , Dance " ( 2005 ) . At the 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards , the music video won the category of People 's Choice : Favourite International Artist . The video was also nominated at the 2006 MTV Australia Video Music Awards in the category of Best Pop Video , but lost to Ashlee Simpson 's " Boyfriend " ( 2005 ) . According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV , the video for " Because of You " was referenced in Taylor Swift 's music video for " Mine " ( 2010 ) , writing " When Swift 's character remembers the fights her parents used to have , her memories mirror Clarkson 's attempts to exorcise the demons of her past to find love in her future .

 Clarkson performed " Because of You " at the 48th Grammy Awards which took place on February 8 , 2006 , at the Staples Center in Los Angeles , California . Donning a red dress and singing from beside a grand piano , her performance in that event garnered positive reviews from critics . Elysa Gardner of USA Today lauded Clarkson 's performance and ranked it as one of the three best performances , writing , " The pre @-@ performance clip of a girlish @-@ looking Clarkson emphasized how little Kelly has matured . The girl most likely to escape the American Idol stigma was in fine , creamy voice , and kept the Mariah @-@ esque riffing to a minimum . " Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times considered Clarkson 's performance as one of the highlights in the event and described her performance as a " thin @-@ skinned rendition [ ... ] in which her whole being seemed involved . " Yahoo ! Music praised Clarkson 's rendition of the song , calling it " perfectly fine " despite the saying that it was " a little reminiscent of those many mediocre , superficial ballads trotted out on ' Idol . ' " On August 21 , 2007 , Clarkson performed " Because of You " and " Never Again " ( 2007 ) on the fifth season of Canadian Idol . 
 " Because of You " was performed at the My December Tour ( 2007 ) .

She also performed the song using only a keyboard as an instrument during her tour at Massey Hall , Toronto . " Because of You " was also performed at the All I Ever Wanted Tour ( 2009 ) . Clarkson 's performance of the song during the tour in the Hammerstein Ballroom , New York City , was given a positive review by Jim Cantiello of MTV .

 In 2007 , Clarkson re @-@ recorded " Because of You " as a duet with American country singer Reba McEntire . The song was released as a single on May 15 , 2007 , as the lead single for McEntire 's album , Reba : Duets . The duet garnered mixed reviews from critics who felt that even though McEntire 's singing was pleasant , she brought nothing new to the song . At the 50th Grammy Awards , McEntire and Clarkson received a nomination for Best Vocal Country Collaboration for the song . In the United States , " Because of You " became McEntire 's seventh song to peak at number two at Hot Country Songs . It also became Clarkson 's first song to appear on the chart . The music video was directed by Roman White which depicts McEntire and Clarkson as two retro Hollywood lounge singers . The plot centers on Clarkson 's relationship with her abusive partner which is witnessed by McEntire . The song was performed live by the two singers in various venues , notably at the 42nd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards and during their 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour .

 According to McEntire , Clarkson was the first singer to pair up with her for the album Reba : Duets ( 2007 ) . She also claimed that " Because of You " was not the original song to be included in the album ; it was another song that she recorded with Clarkson , titled " A Lot Like You . " McEntire explained that it was Narvel , her husband , who convinced her to go back in the studio and record " Because of You " after he heard both McEntire and Clarkson rehearsing the song . She expressed , " Narvel saw it . That wasn 't one of the songs we had talked about recording – matter of fact , Kelly and I had already recorded a song , ' A Lot Like You , ' for the duet project , and he said , ' You 've got to do this one together , ' so we did . " Musically , the song is different from the original version . Thom <unk> of Allmusic described the duet version as " a big , overblown power ballad " which incorporates " guitars compressed to the breaking point , sweeping strings , and enormous crashing cymbals . " The use of violin was also incorporated into the duet , giving it a melodramatic quality that was deemed " unnecessary " by Nancy Dunham of Blogcritics . The song was officially sent to radio stations on May 15 , 2007 , as the lead single from the album . It was added to country radio playlists on May 28 , 2007 .

" The same opinion was echoed by Nancy Dunham of Blogcritics who believed that " the two use just the right amount of vocal passion to make the ardent lyrics come alive , but stay out of the cheese zone . " Scott Sexton of About.com lauded the duet version of the song , writing " As of now anything Reba touches turns to gold , but with this hit alone she has a great shot at platinum . " Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe praised McEntire 's beautiful singing although he said that she did not bring " anything new " to the song . He also added that the song " had the potential to be reworked into an interesting mother / daughter confrontation " but he was disappointed because McEntire did not change the viewpoints of the song . He graded the production of the song as " C- " , writing " The end result is the song doesn ’ t make any sense , and is just confusing to listen to . " Thom Jurek of Allmusic criticized the instrumentation of the song , saying " This could have been a Meat Loaf reject from Bat Out of Hell II . " Gayle Thompson of The Boot ranked " Because of You " at number ten in her list of " Top 20 Reba McEntire songs .

 = Hagley , Tasmania = 
 Hagley is a town in Northern Tasmania , Australia , 22 kilometres ( 14 mi ) southwest of Launceston on the Meander Valley Highway . The area was used by the Port Dalrymple — an early name for George Town in Northern Tasmania — Aboriginal Tasmanians until they were driven from their lands by European settlement . Land grants from the 1820s , to William Thomas Lyttleton , William Bryan and Sir Richard Dry , led to the first buildings , and later gazetting of the town in April 1866 . Lyttleton was associated with Hagley Hall in England ; his naming of his estate led to the town 's name , and he is believed to have bequeathed the town 's land . Hagley is an agricultural centre sited on largely alluvial soil near the Meander River . As of 2011 , the town had a population of 330 , most of whom were Australian born . Hagley is remembered as the first site of coursing in Tasmania , which started at Quamby Estate in 1878 . The town has had cricket and Australian rules football teams , but it no longer fields teams . 
 There are four church buildings in Hagley . A Presbyterian church opened in 1879 ; it is now closed and in private hands . The Uniting Church building is a Modernist design built in 1957 ; it sits next to a wooden Methodist chapel built in 1859 . St Mary 's Anglican Church is a bluestone Gothic Revival building that opened for services in 1862 . The lands and a significant part of the church 's funds were donated by Sir Richard Dry . Dry is buried at the church and the church 's tower is dedicated to his wife . Hagley Farm Primary School is the oldest agricultural school in Australia . It began as the Hagley State School in 1865 and became an area school for the surrounding districts in 1936 . The school has a 64 @-@ hectare ( 160 @-@ acre ) farm and agriculture features strongly in its curriculum . 
 The town has some 19th @-@ century buildings listed on both the Register of the National Estate and the Tasmanian Heritage Register . Hagley Mill is noted as possibly the only extant mill in Australia that was horse @-@ driven . Quamby Estate , the former estate of Sir Richard Dry , is run as a tourist attraction and has a 9 @-@ hole golf course . Hagley 's reticulated water supply is sourced from a filtration and treatment plant at nearby Westbury . This plant opened in 2013 ; from 1902 until then the town had received untreated water . From 1871 the town was serviced by passenger rail , but this ceased prior to 1978 . Hagley was originally on the main road from Launceston to Deloraine , but was bypassed in 2001 when the Hagley section of the Bass Highway was completed . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to the European settlement of what was then Van Diemen 's Land , the Hagley area was a camping ground for the Port Dalrymple aboriginal tribe , the area 's native people ; Port Dalrymple was an early name for George Town . It is uncertain if this tribe was a separate group from the aborigines near Port Sorell and the Mersey River . The Port Dalrymple tribe ventured as far as Westbury , but mainly lived and hunted nearer the Tamar River , and stone implements have been found in the Hagley area . Encounters with the natives and reports of Europeans shooting them feature in the area 's history and mythology . Stephen Dry , cousin to Sir Richard Dry , was reportedly speared by an aboriginal on a hill near Hagley . On a property formerly known as Strath is a water hole named " No , No 's Hole " . There is a legend that 
 ... a mob of blacks who had committed a murder on the property sought refuge there when an avenging party of whites were on their heels . They cried ' No , No , ' and kept diving under the water for safety , but were all shot . 
 By 1830 , aborigines were no longer seen in the area ; they had been driven from their traditional areas by the new settlers . In October that year detachments of " The Black Line " reached nearby Westbury . This was an effort to clear Van Diemen 's land of the last of the natives . 
 William Thomas Lyttleton , William Bryan and Sir Richard Dry were all important figures in the early days of the town . These three owned most of the land of what is now the town and district of Hagley during the 1820s . 
 Sir Richard Dry 's father came to Tasmania as an " Irish Exile " with Lt Governor Colonel William Patterson , founder of Launceston . He spent 13 years as Government Storekeeper at Port Dalrymple . As recognition of his work , on retirement in 1819 he was granted 500 acres ( 200 ha ) of land . Governor Lachlan Macquarie granted him the land that marked the foundation of settlement at Hagley . When the elder Dry died , Sir Richard inherited this and other lands in Tasmania totaling over 30 @,@ 000 acres ( 120 km2 ) . Quamby Estate , a property owned by Sir Richard until his death , is east of the town . Quamby is supposedly an aboriginal word - although its meaning is not certain . William Thomas Lyttleton was born in 1786 in England ; he was a distant connection to those owning Hagley Hall in Worcestershire , England . He spent some years in the army , moving to Van Diemen 's Land in 1822 with his family , after he retired . He was initially granted 560 acres ( 230 ha ) near Westbury , adjacent the land owned by Richard Dry , and 800 near Meander . He called the grant near Westbury ' Hagley ' , in honour of the Town , Parish or Hall in England . Lyttleton built a homestead on the Hagley property in 1829 , though most or all of this original building has been since demolished . He lived in the Hagley area for 14 years , before returning to England . William Bryan , builder of the first flour mill at Carrick , was granted 1 @,@ 077 acres ( 436 ha ) at Hagley in March 1825 . Bryan also had holdings in Carrick and Whitemore totaling 11 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @,@ 500 ha ) . 
 Lyttleton died in England in 1839 . In disposing his estate , the estate 's trustee put all of the lands up for sale . Lyttleton is believed to have bequeathed the village area to the Hagley residents . The block of land containing the Lyttleton homestead was sold in 1843 to a Dr James Richardson , and the remainder of the land was sold to others in 1848 . 
 The first building in the town was a brick church built on the side of the road from Launceston to Westbury . This road was known as the " Westbury Road " , now called the Meander Valley Highway . The church was built for Church of England services and opened in 1848 . It was built at the behest of Sir Richard Dry and Archdeacon R. R. Davies , the latter trustee of the Lyttleton estate , on part of the former estate . The land was a gift to the Church of England by Davies in his capacity as a trustee . By 1849 , the town 's buildings were the Hagley Church of England , an inn — built and run by the East Family opposite the church — and three paling @-@ clad cottages occupied by separate families . At this time the Westbury Road was often a muddy quagmire and land , especially near Quamby bend , that is now cleared was dense forest . The Hagley Inn was opened <unk> , it was first called " The Country Inn " , by James East , who had run the earlier inn in Hagley . Over time the inn has been extensively altered and it closed as a hotel in the late 1980s . In 1850 Hagley 's buildings comprised 
 ... the church , the Hagley Inn , a blacksmith 's shop , a cottage occupied by Mr. <unk> , and one occupied by <unk> , who died recently at Forth ; also one built , I think , by a Mr. Lyons . 
 Hagley 's population increased significantly during the 1850s as people moved both to the village , and to farming properties in the district . A doctor was practicing in the area by 1854 , and in 1855 a school opened in the Church of England ; paid for with funds raised by local residents . That year a postal service began in Hagley . David Parry was appointed postmaster on 1 July 1855 , probably operating an unofficial post office from the Hagley Inn . A post office officially opened on 10 June 1865 , in a building that was demolished in 1970 . This building also had a store called the " six day store " run by the postmaster and his wife . The town gained a second hotel in 1857 with Carmody 's Meander Hotel , though this remained open for only a few years . In 1857 also the town 's first community organisation was formed , the Hagley Ploughing Association , and regular ploughing matches began . A second church was built , a Methodist Chapel on the Westbury road , in 1859 . 
 Mrs Bryan and her husband were concerned about the lack of education in the area . In the early 1860s they provided two acres of land at nearby Glenore , and built a brick school and school house . The Glenore school was finished in 1862 , and it was accompanied by a 260 @-@ acre ( 110 ha ) farm whose rent was to pay for a teacher and building upkeep . A new church , for the Church of England , was built just outside Hagley . St Mary 's Church of Hagley and Quamby was completed and opened in 1862 . The first church continued in use as a school until 1865 . In the prior year construction had begun on a public school , a two @-@ room building with an adjacent 8 @-@ room teacher 's residence ; the school opened in 1865 . Hagley was gazetted as a town in April 1866 . By that time it had a number of stores , a blacksmith , a boot maker , a saddler , a wheelwright , two churches , two schools , two hotels , a resident seamstress and a midwife . By the late 1870s the town had gained , in addition to houses , a police station , gaol , engineering works , one steam mill run by the <unk> Family and another at nearby Quamby . A rail line opened , from Launceston to Westbury , in 1871 , though its station was 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from Hagley . In the 1880s a siding was added at Hoggs Lane , and a passenger platform at the siding in 1910 . Using the new rail line , by the 1880s the post office was receiving four deliveries each weekday and two on Saturday . 
 Electricity reached Hagley in 1928 , supplied by the Tasmanian Hydro @-@ Electric Commission . Prior to this — the year is unknown — there was some street lighting in the form of four dim <unk> lamps set on 10 @-@ foot ( 3 m ) posts . These lights were manually lit and extinguished daily . In 1941 the Hagley Flax Mill began operating to process locally grown flax . This mill was on the Meander River 's bank , three miles from the centre of Hagley . 
 = = Geography and demographics = = 
 Hagley sits on mostly flat land near the Meander River at an elevation of 150 metres ( 490 ft ) above sea level . The land formation is largely alluvial with <unk> <unk> soils , classified as <unk> under the Australian Soil Classification system . These soils date from the Tertiary Period , with some from the more recent Quaternary . Hagley was founded , and remains , an agricultural centre . Dairy and pea @-@ farming prior to World War II have given way to poppies as the principal crop . These poppies are opium poppies grown for Tasmanian Alkaloids , in nearby Westbury . 
 In the first Australian census in 1911 there were 611 people resident in the town and surrounding area . By 1931 this had reduced to 246 , of which 186 lived in the town . In the latest census , in 2011 , 330 people were recorded living in 148 dwellings in the Hagley statistical area . The census does not record the town 's population but the Meander Valley Council notes it as <unk> in 2014 . Hagley 's people are predominantly Australian born with 89 @.@ 1 % reporting as such in the 2011 census . This contrasts with 83 @.@ 6 % for Tasmania and 69 @.@ 8 % for the whole of Australia . 
 The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area , the state legislative council Electoral division of Western Tiers , and the Division of Lyons for both the state and federal houses of representatives .

 The sport of coursing began in Tasmania at Hagley , an event was held 6 – 7 June 1878 at Quamby . For this first event 500 people , including the Governor of Tasmania , came from Launceston . Tasmanian Government Railways ran an excursion train service from Launceston for the event . A coursing competition called the " Waterloo Cup " has a long history in the town . 
 Hagley 's recreation ground opened on the main road in 1902 ; until then local paddocks were used . An Australian rules football club was formed in Hagley <unk> Matches were played on a private paddock until 1902 when they moved to the recreation ground . The club 's most successful period was , as part of the Esk Association , when they won five successive premierships from 1949 – 53 . The club closed in 1998 , as part of a general decline of country football in Tasmania . During the club 's 102 years , the most widely known player was former St Kilda player Matthew Young . 
 Hagley 's cricket team was formed in the 1890s and was playing by 1896 . Similarly to the football club they played on a paddock , adjacent to the current recreation ground , moving to the new ground in 1902 . The ground remains open for cricket though Hagley no longer fields a team . 
 = = Water supply = = 
 In 1898 the Westbury and Hagley Water Act was passed , providing for construction of a reticulated water scheme using water from the Meander River and other streams . Hagley was connected to mains water via the Westbury @-@ Hagley water scheme in 1902 . By 1923 residents of Hagley were asking for an upgrade of the system , as it was seen as inadequate by then . The Westbury Council took out loans in 1952 to extend the system , and work on this extension continued into 1954 , still connected to Westbury although with larger diameter pipes . 
 For over a century the water was supplied untreated . In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in water quality . As Hagley 's water was not fully treated , from time to time contamination required boil @-@ water notices . Sedimentation damaged hot @-@ water cylinders and restricted supply due to the deposits left in the water delivery system . Work began in 2012 on a $ 5 @.@ 5 million water treatment work at Westbury to supply Westbury , Hagley and Exton . This water treatment plant was opened by Ben Lomond Water in June 2013 , supplying filtered and treated water to Hagley .

 = = = Presbyterian = = = 
 There was a Presbyterian visiting preacher in Hagley , from Deloraine , Tasmania , from 1854 . Services were held at this time in the Methodist Chapel . Regular Presbyterian services were being held by 1855 , most likely in the original Church of England building . In the late 1870s , the old Church of England was purchased , along with the associated land , by the Presbyterian church for 265 pounds . The building was demolished in 1878 and construction of a new church was begun almost on the same site . During demolition and construction , Presbyterian services were again held at the Methodist chapel . The foundation stone was laid 18 March 1879 by which time the walls were already nearly complete . Cement rendering has hidden the stone and its location is uncertain . Hagley Presbyterian Church 's first services were held on 14 December 1879 . A manse was built nearby in 1884 . 
 The church used bricks from a demolished brewery , possibly in Longford , and it was completed at a cost of approximately 950 pounds . The building was designed by Harry Conway , a Launceston architect . It is a largely brick building with freestone corbels and copings , and is of a Gothic Revival architectural style . The church is 40 by 25 feet ( 12 @.@ 2 by 7 @.@ 6 m ) with a 12 @-@ by @-@ 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 by 3 @.@ 0 m ) vestry , and was intended to seat 250 people . By 1973 the Presbyterian congregation at Hagley was very small and there was cause for concern about its future . The Presbyterian church building is still in the town , opposite the original Hagley hotel , but is now privately owned and no longer used for worship . 
 = = = Methodist and Uniting Church = = = 
 Hagley has a Uniting Church , built in 1957 , adjacent to the original Methodist Chapel which dates from 1859 . Early Wesleyan ( Methodist ) services were held in the 1840s in a farmhouse in Hoggs Lane . Local Methodists began raising funds for a church in the late 1850s . Land was donated by a George Scott and , at a cost of 370 pounds , a 40 @-@ by @-@ 22 @-@ foot ( 12 @.@ 2 by 6 @.@ 7 m ) wooden chapel and two @-@ roomed caretaker 's cottage were built . This Methodist chapel opened for services on 27 March 1859 . What is now Hagley Uniting Church was built next to the old Methodist church in 1957 . This newer building is of a Modernist design with coloured glass and geometric architectural shapes . The Uniting Church site was listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register in June 2009 .

 Hagley 's first building was a brick church , on " Westbury Road " for Church of England services . The foundation stone was laid 8 January 1847 and the church completed , using materials from Deloraine , and opened 9 June 1848 . It was built on part of the former Lyttleton Estate , funded by Sir Richard Dry and the estate 's trustee , Archdeacon R.R. Davies . When completed the church was in the Parish of Westbury . By 1859 , with population growing , parishioners in Hagley held a meeting to consider forming their own Parish . Dry offered to pay the Minister 's stipend and provide 1000 pounds towards church buildings . Consequent to this offer , the separate Parish of Hagley and Quamby was created . This first church was used until completion of the later St Mary 's Church . It was later demolished to make way for a Presbyterian Church . 
 The Church of England 's parish of Hagley had its beginnings in 1856 when Dry endowed it with three farms . Between them these farms brought in 400 pounds rental income per year . While in England , on a trip taken for his health , Dry commissioned architect Richard Cromwell Carpenter to draw plans for a new church . The plans were modified by Carpenter 's agent in Hobart , Henry Hunter . On returning to Tasmania , Dry donated 13 acres ( 5 @.@ 3 ha ) of land for the church . Hunter was also responsible for designing churches at Westbury , Deloraine , Colebrook , Tasmania and the Church of the Apostles in Launceston . Dry funded construction of the rectory and funded a significant part of the church 's construction . Some other funding came from the sale of the original church and land . As first built it only had a nave and aisle . 
 The brick rectory was completed in 1861 , before construction of the church began . St Mary 's foundation stone was laid 10 December 1861 , in a ceremony attended by Dry and Bishop Francis Nixon , the first Bishop of Tasmania . The church 's structure used local bluestone for the walls , freestone from Bellerive for pillars , arches and mullions , and roof slates from Great Britain . St Mary 's is built in a Gothic Revival architectural style . It was completed and opened in a ceremony on 26 November 1862 . Dry had asked to be buried at St Mary 's . After his death in 1869 a memorial at the church was proposed . The memorial chosen was a chancel , which the original church lacked . Funds were raised by a Government backed appeal , including a donation from Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh . The chancel was started in 1871 , using bluestone from the same quarry as the church , and was finished in August of the same year . To this point the church was seen as incomplete and had not been consecrated . After completion of the chancel St Mary 's was consecrated , by the Bishop of Tasmania Charles Henry <unk> on 24 August 1871 . A tower , spire and vestry were added in 1932 , after work began the prior year . The building work was funded by a bequest from Lady Dry and a Miss Jane Patterson , a St Mary 's churchgoer . The tower is dedicated to Lady Dry and the spire and vestry to Miss Patterson . The spire was designed by H S East , who also restored St Andrew 's church at Westbury . The additions were consecrated 6 December 1932 . 
 St Mary 's church houses recreations of two significant artworks , both donated in 1857 by Lady Clara Dry . The first is a recreation of Guido Reni 's 1610 altarpiece from the Quirinal Palace , Rome . The second a 19th @-@ century copy of Raphael 's Transfiguration . Both were purchased in Italy during the Dry 's honeymoon , and were restored in 2004 . It also contains a copy of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo 's Crucifixion in the East window — a gift from Lady Dry — and a copy of Raphael 's Annunciation . The Nave houses an organ built in 1861 by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd of London . The organ is essentially original , with only the addition of electric blowing , and includes one manual and seven speaking stops . 
 = = Education = = 
 Early education in Hagley was by private tutors . In 1855 a school opened in the Church of England building , taking in both borders and day scholars . Schooling had to sometimes be interrupted as the building was used during school hours for marriages , and religious services . 
 William Bryan and his wife donated land and built a school at nearby Glenore in 1862 . The Bryans left a bequest that fully funded the school until 1914 , when the state 's education department assumed responsibility for the building and the teacher 's salary . By 1921 56 students were attending . The building had been condemned by 1926 and a new brick school building was built a short distance away . Following a direction by Mrs Bryan in her bequest , the school was used at times for religious services , by Methodists and Anglicans . Due to low attendance the school was closed in 1941 and the few remaining pupils continued schooling at Whitemore . 
 Hagley has a single school , Hagley Farm Primary School . It teaches reception to year 6 for , as of 2014 , 420 students . The school has a 64 @-@ hectare ( 160 @-@ acre ) commercial farm attached . The farm is varied with cattle , sheep and crops . The school is the oldest that is specifically dedicated to agricultural education in Australia . 
 The original school building was built in 1865 , on 2 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 ha ) of land just east of the town donated by Sir Richard Dry . This first building is of Gothic Revival form . Its structure and interior are largely intact and original . A decision was made in the 1930s to make Hagley an area school . As of 1935 , there were five single @-@ teacher schools in the local area . All of these were closed and Hagley opened as the " Hagley Area School " on 30 January 1936 . Its curriculum was much expanded from prior years ' and included classes on nutrition , construction , agriculture , <unk> , cooking , carpentry and dressmaking ; these classes were segregated into traditional gender roles . Students from the closed schools were brought to Hagley by bus . At this point most rural schools stopped education at grade 7 but from 1937 Hagley was extended to teach grade 8 . In the late 1930s the school served Hagley , Carrick , Hadspen , <unk> and these town 's surrounding farms , using two buses to transport students . Hagley and Sheffield were the first two area schools in Tasmania . 
 A residential side to the school was planned in 1939 . Buildings would be added and agricultural work expanded with a full sized farm . The start of World War II caused the building plans to be cancelled though they were soon reinstated , and in 1941 building work began . The reversal was spurred by the desire to accommodate victims of The Blitz , though this particular use never eventuated . The school became residential , for boys , and its farm was extended to 200 acres ( 81 ha ) . The first borders were the sons of servicemen . With the extension of the land — the government had purchased 190 acres ( 77 ha ) around the school — the school widened its activities and became known as the Hagley Farm School . Students , as part of their education , built many of the farm 's buildings during the war . J Maslin had been principle since 1931 . In 1944 while explaining the schools philosophy he stated 
 We give an acre for a cow or sheep willingly , while we shut our children and our chickens up in too limited spaces , and they suffer in consequence . Schools of the future must be provided with estates where the children will be surrounded with many natural and beautiful things . 
 Part of the practical work was growing food for the school . In 1944 the daily two @-@ course dinner , for staff and over 90 students , was mostly the school 's farm 's produce . After the war , from <unk> – 55 , the school received child migrants from Belgium , Greece and the United Kingdom . The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936 , Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since . 
 = = Transport = = 
 A rail line near Hagley was first surveyed in 1856 , as part of a route from Launceston to Deloraine . A decade later a Railway Act was passed , strongly supported by then Premier of Tasmania Sir Richard Dry . A private company , the Launceston and Western Railway Company , was formed to build the route and the first sod turned in January 1868 by Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh . The rail line passed 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) south of the town and a station was built 2 miles ( 3 km ) distant . The line opened , and the first train passed near Hagley , on 10 February 1871 . The rail line carried passengers , and several daily mail deliveries . Launceston and Western Railway soon ran into financial problems , the line closed 29 June 1872 and the company itself went bankrupt on 25 July . The government took over the railway , as the Tasmanian Government Railways , on 31 October 1873 . Local farmers petitioned for an additional line to properties in Hagley 's west . Construction began on the new line in 1887 and a siding as built at the intersection of Hoggs Lane . This siding was used first for farm produce , later facilities for loading stock were added . A platform and waiting room were added in 1910 , though it was some years before passenger trains stopped at Hoggs Lane . The passenger rail service had stopped before 1978 , a time when all Tasmanian passenger rail services ceased . 
 The road through Hagley , now called the Meander Valley Highway , was originally the main road west from Launceston . Beginning in the 1990s work began on a replacement highway that would bypass all the towns between Prospect and Deloraine , including Hagley . As the road was part of the National Highway this work was funded by the federal government . The federal transport department announced , in 1999 , that they were to spend $ 36 million bypassing Hagley and Westbury with the new Bass Highway . A this time <unk> vehicles per day were driving through Hagley , the bypass was expected to more than halve this . The new highway passed by the historic Hagley Mill site and so , as part of the construction , the federal government funded pre- and post @-@ construction preservation work on the Mill site . Local residents were concerned about the impact on Hagley of the reduction in through traffic and the Westbury @-@ Hagley Development Committee was investigating . The town 's centre was finally bypassed when the Bass Highway 's Westbury @-@ Hagley bypass was opened on 13 December 2001 . 
 As of 2014 the only public transport in Hagley is school buses , operated by the private <unk> and Redline Coaches companies .

 Hagley retains 19th century buildings , some are listed on the now closed Register of the National Estate , some also on the Tasmanian Heritage Register . 
 Hagley house is a brick and stucco , two @-@ storey Georgian era house 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) from the town 's centre . Construction was begun by William Lyttleton prior to 1848 , at which time it was noted as incomplete , and completed , after Lyttleton 's death , by Dr Richardson . 
 Hagley mill is a historic site , 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) south of Hagley 's centre , on part of the former Hagley Estate . The mill and land are owned by the Department of Transport ; they were acquired as part of the construction of Bass Highway . The site 's significance is that it is possibly the only extant mill in Australia that was horse @-@ driven , and almost certainly the only example in Tasmania . The mill and associated buildings date from 1830 – 40 . The mill appears to have been converted <unk> to fit a mobile steam mill . Its wheel house has original ironstone foundations and brick walls forming an octagonal building , a design peculiarity to accommodate the horses and driving mechanism . The site has a barn , one @-@ room cottage and dairy that all date from the mill 's construction . 
 Quamby house was built for Sir Richard Dry in 1838 , probably to a design by Richard Cromwell Carpenter . It was built mostly by convict labour , using locally made clay bricks , in an American Colonial style , a single storey with a stone @-@ flagged long veranda . The original estate was broken up in the second half of the 19th century . Quamby was opened for tourism , by Tasmanian Premier David Bartlett on 4 October 2009 . It is operated as the Quamby Golf and Country Club , and has a par 38 9 @-@ hole golf course that dates from the early 1990s . 
 = California State Route 94 = 
 State Route 94 ( SR 94 ) is a highway in the U.S. state of California . The western portion is known as the Martin Luther King Jr . Freeway that begins at Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) in downtown San Diego and continues to the end of the freeway portion past SR 125 in Spring Valley . The non @-@ freeway segment of SR 94 that continues east through the mountains to I @-@ 8 near Boulevard is known as Campo Road . 
 The Campo road served as a wagon road providing access to eastern San Diego County as well as Imperial County . The road was added to the state highway system in 1933 , and signs for Route 94 were posted along local roads later that decade . Efforts to convert the western half of the route to a freeway took place in the 1950s , and the freeway was complete by 1962 west of the road that became SR 125 . Construction continued east to Avocado Road over the next few years . Various proposals for widening the highway have come from Caltrans , but local opposition resulted in the delay or cancellation of many of these proposals . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 94 is an east – west freeway that begins at the eastern end of the one @-@ way couplet of F and G streets in southeast San Diego . The freeway continues through an interchange with I @-@ 5 just east of downtown . Following this , the route goes through the neighborhoods of Sherman Heights , Grant Hill , Stockton , and Mount Hope , where there is an interchange with SR 15 . Shortly thereafter , SR 94 intersects I @-@ 805 in <unk> View before continuing east through Emerald Hills and <unk> Creek into the city of Lemon Grove . Passing by the Marketplace at the Grove Mall , the freeway forms the boundary between Lemon Grove to the south and La Mesa to the north , up to the SR 125 interchange where SR 94 turns east . At this point , SR 94 leaves both cities and enters unincorporated Spring Valley and Casa de Oro . 
 The freeway becomes an undivided highway at Via Mercado in Rancho San Diego . SR 94 continues through Rancho San Diego by turning southeast at the Jamacha Road and Campo Road intersection , where SR 54 and CR S17 turn northeast . As Campo Road , SR 94 crosses the Sweetwater River before entering a less @-@ developed area , winding through the communities of Jamul , Dulzura and intersecting the north end of SR 188 north of Tecate . After passing through the communities of Potrero , Campo , and the Campo Indian Reservation , SR 94 continues east onto old U.S. Route 80 ( US 80 ) briefly before turning north on <unk> Road west of Boulevard . The route ends by connecting to I @-@ 8 near Manzanita . 
 SR 94 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System , and west of SR 188 is part of the National Highway System , a network of highways that are essential to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . SR 94 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System , but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation . In 2014 , SR 94 had an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 440 at Live Oak Springs Road , and 179 @,@ 000 between I @-@ 805 and 47th Street , the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway .

 = = = Campo Road = = = 
 SR 94 was built along the routing of an old stagecoach road that took two days to travel to East County in the 19th century ; it was part of the primary road from San Diego to Yuma , Arizona . James Pascoe surveyed the route through Campo for the county in 1869 that was 25 miles ( 40 km ) shorter than the existing route through Warner 's Pass . The road was known for its curves , climbs , and boulders , making travel difficult . The first automobile went on the road in 1904 . By 1913 , an unpaved automobile road extended to Campo from San Diego , and work took place to improve the condition of the road in 1916 . A year later , the road continued east to join with the state highway leading into Imperial County . In 1927 , the Potrero bridge was replaced , after a storm washed out the bridge . By 1928 , the paving of the Campo road was about 43 percent complete . In February of the next year , the progress was at 74 percent ; the total cost was $ 122 @,@ 474 ( about $ 30 million in 2015 dollars ) . The Sweetwater bridge was finished in March at a cost of $ 60 @,@ 000 ( about $ 4 million in 2015 dollars ) . The Campo road was the only road through the Peninsular Ranges to stay open for the entirety of the next winter ; other roads were closed due to snow , leading to increased traffic along this road . This was largely due to the lower elevation of the road , at only 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) . 
 = = = Designation and initial construction = = = 
 In 1931 , the County Board of Supervisors agreed to submit the Campo road for consideration as a secondary state highway . The state considered the inclusion of the Campo road into the system in 1932 . The California State Legislature defined Route 200 in 1933 as a route from San Diego to west of Jacumba , going through the town of Campo . The San Diego Chamber of Commerce sent a representative to ask the state for funding for paving the Campo highway in 1935 , and the road was paved that year . The Chamber also asked for the war department to declare the road a military highway in order to receive federal assistance for its improvement . Signs were posted for SR 94 in 1937 , and by 1938 , SR 94 was signed along Broadway and Lemon Grove Boulevard ( later Federal Boulevard ) before continuing east to Campo . 
 The next year , the California Highway Commission declined to have the Campo road improved . However , the Highway 94 association , as well as the Campo @-@ Potrero and Highway 80 chambers of commerce raised concerns about the safety of the children going to school in the buses along the road . In 1952 , the Southern California committee of the state Chamber of Commerce recommended to the California Highway Commission that Route 94 be widened to four lanes from the Wabash Freeway to Jamacha . In June 1953 , the Commission approved an eight @-@ lane freeway for Route 94 from Home Avenue in San Diego to Palm Avenue around La Mesa ; The local Board of Education also gave their approval , which was required because the freeway would be built on land that was for a proposed school . But the next month , state senator Fred Kraft criticized the proposal because he believed that it would be too expensive and would not reduce congestion in the long @-@ term . Approval extended to the junction with US 80 by October 1953 ; the part from 18th Street to Wabash Boulevard followed in November 1954 . Later that year , a toll road that would have tunneled under the Laguna Mountains and bypassed Route 94 was proposed by the county Board of Supervisors . The state allocated $ 3 @.@ 48 million ( about $ 81 million in 2015 dollars ) for making SR 94 a freeway from College Avenue to Campo Road in October 1954 . 
 Construction began on the first part of the SR 94 freeway just west of Lemon Grove by May 1955 . The contract for the College Avenue to Campo Road portion was given out in October , for $ 2 @.@ 9 million ( about $ 63 million in 2015 dollars ) . Preparation for bidding on the portion from the Wabash Freeway to near Euclid Avenue took place towards the end of the year ; construction was underway by May 1956 , as was planning for the portion west of there to the intersection of 18th and F streets and the future interchange with US 101 . The San Diego City Council requested that an overpass be constructed at 22nd Street to provide improved access ; however , an underpass for the road was eventually built . The freeway from Wabash Boulevard and 56th was completed on March 18 , 1957 ; metal weakened @-@ plane joints were used for the construction , which the California Division of Highways considered " experimental " at the time . East of College Avenue , some unwanted cracks developed in the roadway during the joint pouring process , and were repaired with epoxy . At one point in 1958 , SR 94 was considered as a possible extension of US 90 , a route proposed to run along the southern border of the United States to Florida , by the South Bay Highway Association . By August , SR 94 from Palm Avenue to Jamacha was being planned . 
 The western end of SR 94 connecting to US 101 was put up for the bidding process in late 1958 . Construction on the interchange with US 101 began in 1961 . By January 1962 , the freeway was mostly complete west of La Mesa and the freeway connection to US 80 . The part of the freeway from 25th to 17th streets was completed in November . In the 1964 state highway renumbering , SR 94 was officially designated from I @-@ 5 to I @-@ 8 near Jacumba , and SR 125 was designated from SR 94 near La Mesa north to SR 56 .

 Land acquisition for the construction of the SR 94 freeway through Spring Valley had begun by 1965 . The next year , a plan to reroute and widen portions of SR 94 from the Sweetwater River to I @-@ 8 was underway , with a Caltrans proposal to remove the " Frenchy 's " or " Three Springs " curve . In March 1968 , the San Diego Highway Development Association considered the construction of the freeway from SR 125 to Jamacha Junction a priority . The state announced in August that the Spring Valley widening project would be funded earlier than anticipated , due to the state of the economy . Meanwhile , a $ 1 @.@ 8 million ( about $ 21 million in 2015 dollars ) contract to widen SR 94 to eight lanes from Wabash Boulevard to Waite Drive in Lemon Grove was awarded in October . The freeway from Kenwood Drive to Avocado Boulevard in Spring Valley was completed in July 1970 . 
 An improved interchange with SR 125 was being planned in 1974 , which would connect to the existing freeway extending to Avocado Boulevard . Construction began in October , and continued into late 1975 , at a cost of $ 11 million ( about $ 78 million in 2015 dollars ) ; the road was predicted to reduce traffic at the intersection of Campo Road and Bancroft Drive , and interchanges at Spring Street and Lemon Grove Avenue were to be built . The Lemon Grove Avenue interchange was open by January 30 , 1976 , and parts of the interchange with Spring Street and SR 125 was open by July 20 . 
 By 1977 , much of the SR 94 freeway was congested , with 85 @,@ 000 to 95 @,@ 000 trips per day on the freeway according to Caltrans . It was hoped that the construction of SR 54 to the south and SR 125 would reduce traffic by 20 @,@ 000 trips per day . <unk> meters were installed in 1978 to throttle traffic entering the freeway with a centralized computer system ; this resulted in reduced congestion on the freeway , according to motorists . In 1987 , the bridge over the Sweetwater River that had been used for 58 years was replaced by a new bridge , at a cost of $ 2 @.@ 3 million ( about $ 6 million in 2015 dollars ) ; construction had been delayed by nine months due to concern over environmental harm to the least Bell 's vireo . 
 The highway was designated the Martin Luther King Jr . Freeway by the California State Legislature in September 1989 , after a two @-@ year struggle to find a suitable tribute to King in the San Diego area . Nevertheless , the measure did not include funding for the signs , and as a result , they were not installed until 1998 , when they were funded by the San Diego Association of Governments with $ 1 @.@ 4 million ( about $ 2 million in 2015 dollars ) from a local sales tax . 
 In 1995 , a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint was opened near Dulzura , to combat human and drug trafficking that used SR 94 , as well as fatal traffic accidents resulting from such smuggling . Two years later , following a proposal to widen SR 94 from Otay Lakes Road to SR 188 to address the high rate of accidents , local residents raised concerns about this proposal . In July 1998 , the Back Country Coalition sued Caltrans concerning the short length of the environmental impact report as well as not soliciting comments from the public ; opponents pushed for a ban of all " large haulers " on the highway . Caltrans agreed to hold another hearing in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement , as well as to pay $ 20 @,@ 000 for the attorneys . In March 1999 , Caltrans agreed to delay the construction for several years to evaluate the environmental impact . During the early 2000s , the interchange with SR 125 was reconstructed to allow for the extension of the latter freeway south to SR 54 , which was finished in 2003 . 
 In late 2006 , the Jamul Indian tribe prepared to construct a casino , but many expressed concerns about the amount of traffic that would now travel on SR 94 . In 2007 , Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit in order to connect to SR 94 and to construct on the state right @-@ of @-@ way . At the end of the year , the tribe had started construction on the driveway to the casino , while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information needed to determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved . In late 2009 , the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway . The tribe made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval , but this was rejected by the court . Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009 , where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation .

 Caltrans has plans to add a ramp from southbound SR 125 to SR 94 to improve the interchange ; it is in the environmental planning stages , and is estimated to cost $ 71 million .

 = Andrew Dudley = 
 Sir Andrew Dudley , KG ( c . 1507 – 1559 ) was an English soldier , courtier , and diplomat . A younger brother of John Dudley , 1st Duke of Northumberland , he served in Henry VIII 's navy and obtained court offices under Edward VI . In 1547 – 1548 he acted as admiral of the fleet and participated in the War of the Rough Wooing in Scotland , where he commanded the English garrison of Broughty Castle . He was appointed captain of the fortress of Guînes in the Pale of Calais in late 1551 . There he got involved in a dispute with the Lord Deputy of Calais , which ended only when both men were replaced in October 1552 . 
 In October 1549 Andrew Dudley became one of Edward VI 's Chief Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber and later keeper of the Palace of Westminster , in which function he was responsible for the Royal Wardrobe and Privy Purse . In early 1553 he was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Emperor Charles V to suggest peace talks between France and the Empire . Andrew Dudley was <unk> to Margaret Clifford , a first cousin of Lady Jane Grey , in June 1553 ; yet his marriage plans came to naught with the accession of Mary I , and on 19 August 1553 he was condemned to death for his part in his brother 's attempt to establish Lady Jane on the English throne . Released in January 1555 , he lived in London until his death in 1559 . 
 = = Family and early career = = 
 Andrew Dudley was one of three sons of Edmund Dudley , a councillor of King Henry VII , and his second wife Elizabeth Grey , daughter of Edward Grey , 4th Viscount Lisle . When he was a toddler , his father was executed by the young Henry VIII as a scapegoat for the former king 's financial policies . His eldest brother was John Dudley , later Duke of Northumberland , who sought to advance him in the king 's service . Andrew Dudley served in the household of Thomas Howard , 3rd Duke of Norfolk , and as an officer of the exchequer in the 1540s . Answering a complaint against exchequer activities in October 1540 , Norfolk told the Privy Council that the only two people he had ever found jobs for were Andrew Dudley and Edward <unk> . 
 The brother of the Lord High Admiral , Dudley served in the royal navy and commanded the new royal ship Swallow in 1545 . In March 1546 , he went on his first diplomatic mission to the Regent of Flanders . In his role as Equerry of the Stable , he delivered Henry VIII 's gift of hackney horses , greyhounds and running dogs .

 In early 1547 Protector Somerset , the English regent , was contemplating to take up the War of the Rough Wooing once more to press home the agreed marriage of Edward VI and Mary Queen of Scots . On 27 February Andrew Dudley was appointed admiral of the fleet . He was to oversee the " annoyance of the Scots " in the North Sea and to interrupt the shipping of munition from France to Scotland . On 7 March he captured one of the Scottish principal ships , the Great Lion off Dover , giving her a broadside from the <unk> ( correctly the <unk> , sometimes called the Pansy ) . Odet de <unk> , the French ambassador in London , gained a detailed account from Nicolas d <unk> , a French painter and cartographer . Dudley was 30 miles from Yarmouth when he saw the Great Lion , with the <unk> , the Mary <unk> and another unnamed Scottish ship . The Great Lion was overwhelmed by superior firepower , and the others surrendered , excepting the unnamed ship . The Lion was lost while being towed to Yarmouth when she grounded on a sandbank . Those on board were brought as prisoners to the Tower of London , and at least one notable passenger was killed in the firefight . The Privy Council sent Dudley a letter of commendation on 10 March 1547 for " his hardy enterprise against the Scots " with more detailed instructions . Dudley was told to lay up the <unk> and other ships for repair ; he was to release his Scottish prisoners , except notables , " gentlemen of estimation " , and 40 sailors judged to be the best seamen and pilots . Those released would pay their ransom at £ 4 for a master or officer , and 40 shillings a sailor or mariner . 
 Dudley then sailed North to treat with the Fife lairds who had killed Cardinal Beaton . They were holding St Andrews Castle against the Regent Arran with his eldest son James Hamilton as hostage . The lairds , who became known as the " Castilians " , signed a contract with Dudley , according to which they were to receive English aid to hold the castle against the Scottish government : 
 for the better ... <unk> of themselves and His Majesty 's friends in Scotland and the advancement and perfection of the said marriage [ as well as ] a perpetual peace , unity and ... natural love between both the realms . 
 The Castilians promised to surrender St. Andrews Castle and Arran 's son to the English when they should appear . Dudley also struck a bargain with Lord Gray , a disaffected Scottish noble who owned Broughty Castle , a fortress near Dundee . The chronicler and eye @-@ witness William Patten noted its strategic importance : " it standeth in such sort at the mouth of the river Tay , that being gotten , both Dundee and [ Perth ] , and many other towns else shall become subject to this hold or be compelled to forgo their use of the river . " Lord Gray 's contribution would be the surrender of his castle and help in taking Perth . 
 St. Andrews Castle fell in July 1547 , which greatly strengthened French influence in Scotland and triggered an English invasion . Andrew Dudley assisted the campaign at sea , under the command of Lord Clinton . Shortly after the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh Dudley was knighted by Edward Seymour , Duke of Somerset . On 20 September 1547 he was appointed captain of the English garrison at Broughty Castle . Lord Gray had surrendered it after three token cannon shots from the English ships . Dudley complained to Somerset in October 1547 that " never had a man had so weak a company of soldiers given to drinking , eating and slothfulness , " though , " the house stands well . " However , it had " scant window to shut , nor door , nor bolt , ... nor nail " . Re @-@ fortification was supervised by a resident Italian engineer , Master John Rossetti , and included building a new platform for cannon on the roof and strengthening of the curtain wall . 
 Andrew Dudley secured a bond of alliance from the town of Dundee by firing on the town from his two ships , the Bark Ager and the Mary <unk> , at the end of October 1547 . In an effort to promote the Protestant Reformation , he hoped to distribute Tyndale and <unk> 's Bible in Dundee . Lord Gray and the Master of Ruthven continued to bargain for the surrender of Perth in December 1547 , but the English never secured the town . Dudley was assisted by a subordinate , Thomas Wyndham who sailed several times up the Tay towards Perth looking for supplies . On 22 January 1548 , he sent Wyndham across the Forth to Fife to burn houses . Dudley 's plan was to draw his besiegers to attack him and he kept behind his main force . The Scots and French took the opportunity offered to attack Broughty and were repulsed back to Dundee after a " hot skirmish " . The trick did not work a second time on 25 January , and Wyndham 's landing party in Fife encountered an ambush of 600 men ; 10 soldiers were killed and 20 sailors injured . Dudley built a second fort to command Dundee in March 1548 with the engineer Master John Rossetti and Sir Thomas Palmer . He was relieved at Broughty by Thomas Wyndham 's nephew , Sir John Luttrell . On 3 April 1548 , Dudley and Luttrell were instructed by the Privy Council to try to agree a yearly pension for Lord Gray at a figure between 600 and 1000 crowns . 
 = = Military and court appointments = = 
 Dudley 's next military appointment after his service in Scotland was under Lord Russell against the Western Rebellion in August 1549 . In early 1551 Dudley became captain of the English garrison at Guînes . However , he incurred large debts " by his service " , and became involved in a dispute with Lord Willoughby , the Lord Deputy of Calais . In January 1552 they were recalled to England and summoned before the Privy Council . Finally , to resolve the feud , both men were relieved of their posts in October . During 1552 Dudley also surveyed the coastal defenses of Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight to advise on their improvement . 
 Under Edward VI , Dudley also obtained court appointments and responsibilities ; a member of the Privy Chamber , on 24 March 1547 he was given custody of a purse of £ 1435 @-@ 9s @-@ 6d . Dudley 's brother John ousted the Protector in October 1549 , and Andrew became one of the newly created Chief Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber . These four " principal gentlemen " had " the singular care " of the King 's person and were each rewarded with £ 100 p.a. A year later Dudley also became keeper of the Palace of Westminster , where he made an inventory of wardrobe and household goods . Effectively in charge of the Privy Purse , he was responsible for receiving and paying out royal cash and looking after " all the jewels ... and other things in the palace " .

 In 1552 Dudley was made a Knight of the Garter ; at the end of the year he was sent on a diplomatic mission to discuss Edward VI 's hopes to mediate for peace between the Empire and France . He first travelled to Brussels , where he was received by Mary of Hungary on 8 January 1553 . Impatient to see the Emperor himself , he tried to intercept him on his way to Flanders . Sir Richard Morrison , the English resident ambassador with Charles V , knew nothing of this until he met Dudley at Treves . The ailing ruler was averse to be molested by diplomats while journeying , nevertheless Morrison arranged an interview at Luxembourg in which Charles referred them to a later occasion . On 11 February 1553 the Emperor gave the Englishmen an audience at Brussels . When Dudley offered to kiss his hand , he embraced him . The visitors noted that the chamber was hung with tapestries depicting the Emperor 's victories at Tunis . Charles V was non @-@ committal , declaring that he was well @-@ disposed to peace if he only could trust the French king . On returning to England Dudley had an audience with Edward on 19 February . Jehan Scheyfve , the Emperor 's agent , reported that Dudley was discreet , and only mentioned that Charles had given him a present . The French ambassador in London was not pleased . Dudley was elected MP for Oxfordshire in the March parliament of 1553 , carrying Edward 's train at the proceedings . 
 = = Marriage plans and disgrace = = 
 In April 1553 Dudley was commanded by the King to release cloth of silver and gold and velvet for the marriage of his nephew Lord Guildford to Lady Jane Grey , which was celebrated on 25 May . In June , Jehan de Scheyfve reported that Dudley himself would marry Margaret Clifford , a granddaughter of Mary Tudor , Queen of France , and cousin of Lady Jane , and that he would be made Lieutenant @-@ Governor of the North . Dudley had even reserved a number of items from the wardrobe at Westminster for the marriage , including jewels , silver and gilt cups , a hair @-@ brush , velvet dog @-@ collars , and a pair of pictures of Diana and Actaeon . However , Edward VI died on 6 July 1553 , having named Lady Jane Grey as his heir . 
 Andrew Dudley assembled a force of 500 men at Ware , Hertfordshire to assist in his brother 's campaign against Mary Tudor . Presumably arrested with him in East Anglia , he was imprisoned in the Tower on 25 July . Accused with his family of rebellion and high treason , Dudley stood trial at Westminster Hall on 19 August 1553 . He pleaded guilty and only asked that his jewels that were in the keeping of a wardrobe colleague should not be lost . On 21 August 1553 , the day before John Dudley 's execution , he appeared with him and other condemned persons at the Tower Chapel St. Peter ad Vincula to hear mass . His life was spared , and he was released in January 1555 . 
 In April 1555 , after his formal pardon , Philip and Mary granted Dudley a pension of £ 100 p.a. He was allowed to retain some of his earlier possessions , which had been valued at £ 555 at the time of his arrest in 1553 . He moved to Tothill Street , London and , " sick of body " , made his will in July 1556 . In it he tried to reclaim jewels and other stuffs the Earl of Cumberland had received in advance of Dudley 's intended marriage with Margaret Clifford . Among the intended beneficiaries were his nephews Ambrose , Robert Dudley , and Henry Sidney , his nephew @-@ by @-@ marriage . He died three years later , sometime before his will was proved on 22 November 1559 . 
 = Nuisance in English law = 
 Nuisance in English law is an area of tort law broadly divided into two torts ; private nuisance , where the actions of the defendant are " causing a substantial and unreasonable interference with a [ claimant ] ' s land or his use or enjoyment of that land " , and public nuisance , where the defendant 's actions " materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty 's subjects " ; public nuisance is also a crime . Both torts have been present from the time of Henry III , being affected by a variety of philosophical shifts through the years which saw them become first looser and then far more stringent and less protecting of an individual 's rights . Each tort requires the claimant to prove that the defendant 's actions caused interference , which was unreasonable , and in some situations the intention of the defendant may also be taken into account . A significant difference is that private nuisance does not allow a claimant to claim for any personal injury suffered , while public nuisance does . 
 Private nuisance has received a range of criticism , with academics arguing that its concepts are poorly defined and open to judicial manipulation ; Conor <unk> has written that " Private nuisance has , if anything , become even more confused and confusing . Its chapter lies neglected in the standard works , little changed over the years , its modest message overwhelmed by the excitements to be found elsewhere in tort . Any sense of direction which may have existed in the old days is long gone " . In addition , it has been claimed that the tort of private nuisance has " lost its separate identity as a strict liability tort and been assimilated in all but name into the fault @-@ based tort of negligence " , and that private and public nuisance " have little in common except the accident of sharing the same name " . 
 = = History = = 
 The tort of nuisance has existed since the reign of Henry III , with few changes , and most of them merely technical . It originally came from the Latin <unk> , and then the French nuisance , with Henry de Bracton initially defining the tort of nuisance as an infringement of easements . The tort was in line with the economic status quo of the time , protecting claimants against their neighbours ' rights to develop land , and thus has been described as " rural , agricultural , and conservative " . There were initially four remedies for nuisance ; the assize of nuisance , similar to the assize of novel disseisin , which was limited to situations where the defendant 's actions interfered with the claimant 's seisin ; the action <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the land in question was alienated ; the writ of trespass ; and the " action upon the case for nuisance " , which became the main remedy . This was because it was far faster than the other writs and actions , and unlike them did not require that both parties be freeholders . It was , however , limited to damages , and unlike the other remedies did not allow for abatement . 
 By the 17th century the judicial philosophy had changed to allow the protection of a claimant 's enjoyment of their land , with the duty being on the party that caused the nuisance to prevent it : " as every man is bound to look to his cattle , as to keep them out of his neighbour 's ground ; so he must keep in the filth of his house of office , that it may not flow in upon and <unk> his neighbour " . During the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution , the law of nuisance significantly changed ; rather than the previous tests a standard of care was instead expected , with different standards applying to individuals and companies . In reaching these decisions the courts " effectively emasculated the Law of Nuisance as a useful curb on industrial pollution " . In St Helen 's Smelting Co v Tipping , for example , several judges " were explicit in suggesting that they were affected by the adverse effect of a more draconian view on the economic welfare of the country 's industrial cities " . This contrasted with the previous view , which was that when liability was established for a case where the defendant 's actions had interfered with the enjoyment of land , the defendant would be liable however trivial the interference . 
 The decisions reached during this period vary , however , mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time . While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent philosophy was one of laissez faire thanks to the influence of philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith , Michael W. Flinn asserted that : 
 Another common error ... has been the assumption that the classical economists were the only effective influence on social and economic policy in the early and mid @-@ nineteenth century . This is a curiously perverse view , since it ignores powerful voices like those of Bentham , Chadwick , the social novelists , many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession , the humanitarians , the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many working class movements . There was in short , nothing approaching a consensus of opinion concerning laissez @-@ faire and state intervention , even in the very narrow social sector represented by governments , Parliament , and the press . In practice the ears of ministers were assaulted by a confused babble of voices rather than bewitched by the soft whisper of a single plea for inaction . 
 = = Private nuisance = = 
 Private nuisance was defined in Bamford v <unk> , where George Wilshere , 1st Baron Bramwell defined it as " any continuous activity or state of affairs causing a substantial and unreasonable interference with a [ claimant 's ] land or his use or enjoyment of that land " . Private nuisance , unlike public nuisance , is only a tort , and damages for personal injuries are not recoverable . Only those who have a legal interest in the affected land can sue ; an exception was made in <unk> v Bush , where the Court of Appeal held that a woman living in her mother 's house was entitled to an injunction to prevent telephone harassment despite having no legal interest in the property . In Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd , however , the House of Lords rejected this development , arguing that to remove the need for an interest in the affected property would transform the tort of nuisance from a tort to land into a tort to the person . The liable party under private nuisance is the creator , even if he is no longer in occupation of the land or created a nuisance on somebody else 's land . In <unk> @-@ Denfield v O 'Callaghan , it was held that the defendant was liable for a nuisance ( a set of water pipes ) even though he had not created it , because he had used the pipes and thereby " adopted " the nuisance . 
 There is a general rule that a landlord who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land . There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance , as in Tetley v Chitty , or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises , as in <unk> v Cohen . The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let , and he knew or ought to have known about it . Under the principle of vicarious liability , an occupier of land can also be liable for the actions of their employees ; in Matania v National Provincial Bank , it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances . 
 For there to be a claim in private nuisance , the claimant must show that the defendant 's actions caused damage . This can be physical damage , as in St Helen 's Smelting Co v Tipping , or discomfort and inconvenience . The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability , as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc ; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance , the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance . The test is whether or not the nuisance was reasonably foreseeable ; if it was , the defendant is expected to avoid it . 
 = = = Interference = = = 
 The claimant must first show that the defendant 's actions have caused an interference with their use or enjoyment of the land . These interferences are indirect , and almost always the result of continuing events rather than a one @-@ off incident . This interference may be a physical invasion of the land , such as in Davey v Harrow Corporation , noise , as in Christie v Davey , or smells , such as in Wheeler v J J Saunders . The courts have allowed cases where the interference causes emotional distress , as in Thompson @-@ Schwab v <unk> , but have been loath to protect recreational facilities or " things of delight " ; things such as the blocking of a pleasant view or a television signal are not considered a nuisance . The latter was discussed in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd , where the claimants argued that the blocking of their television signal by the construction of the skyscraper at One Canada Square was a nuisance . The House of Lords rejected this argument . There are rights to land known as <unk> , such as the right to light through windows or the right of support . An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising , assuming they are aware of the interference 's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions , as in Leakey v National Trust , which established that in such situations " the standard ought to be to require of the occupier what is reasonable to expect of him in his individual circumstances " . This principle was extended in Holbeck Hall Hotel v Scarborough Borough Council , where the Court of Appeal said that if a landowner knows or ought to know that their property may cease to support another 's , they are required to take reasonable precautions or they will be liable . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 While there is no set definition of what is or is not unreasonable , factors that are taken into account include any " abnormal sensitivity " of the claimant , the nature of the locality where the nuisance took place , the time and duration of the interference and the conduct of the defendant . " Abnormal sensitivity " is where the claimant 's damaged property is particularly sensitive to damage by the defendant 's actions . In Robinson v Kilvert , it was established that if the action of the defendant would not have caused damage were it not for this abnormal sensitivity , the defendant is not liable . However if the damage was caused to abnormally sensitive property but would also have damaged non @-@ sensitive property , the defendant is liable , as in McKinnon Industries v Walker . This was because it infringed on the " right to ordinary enjoyment " ; as a result , the claimant could claim for his more sensitive activities as well . 
 The locality where the interference occurred also influences whether or not it was unreasonable ; in Sturges v Bridgman , Thesiger LJ wrote that " what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square [ a residential area ] would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey [ a smelly industrial area ] " . If an activity is out of place with the locality , it is likely to be held as unreasonable . However , the nature of areas can change over time ; in Gillingham Borough Council v Medway ( Chatham ) Dock Co Ltd , it was held that the granting of planning permission to develop a commercial dock in an area changed that area 's character , preventing the local residence from claiming in private nuisance for the disturbance the dock created . The granting of planning permission does not constitute immunity from a claim in nuisance , however ; in Wheeler v Saunders Ltd. the Court of Appeal said that it would be " a misuse of language to describe what has happened in the present case as a change in the character of the neighbourhood . It is a change of use of a very small piece of land ... it is not a strategic planning decision affected by considerations of public interest . Unless one is prepared to accept that any planning decision authorises any nuisance which must inevitably come from it , the argument that the nuisance was authorised by planning permission in this case must fail " . In situations where the defendant 's activities cause physical damage , as in St Helen 's Smelting Co v Tipping , the locality of the activities is not a factor in deciding their unreasonableness . 
 The time and duration of the activity is also taken into account when determining unreasonableness . Activities may be reasonable at one time but not at another ; in Halsey v Esso Petroleum , filling oil tankers at 10am was held to be reasonable , but the same activity undertaken at 10pm was unreasonable . A private nuisance is normally a " continuing state of affairs " , not a one @-@ off situation ; there are exceptions , such as in De Keyser 's Royal Hotel v Spicer , where <unk> at night was considered a nuisance . In such situations , the normal remedy is to grant an injunction limiting the time of the activity . Another exception was found in British Celanese v AH Hunt Ltd , where an electronics company stored foil strips on their property which blew onto adjoining land , causing the power supply to a nearby yarn manufacturers to be cut off . A similar incident had occurred 3 years earlier and the defendants had been warned to store their strips properly ; it was held that even though the power cut was a one @-@ off event , the method of storing the foil strips constituted a continuing state of affairs , and the defendants were liable . 
 = = = Conduct of the defendant = = = 
 In some circumstances , the conduct of the defendant can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference . In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions . This is one of the few exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law . In Christie v Davey , the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants ; based on this , it was held that their actions were malicious , unreasonable , and amounted to a nuisance . 
 = = = Issues with private nuisance = = = 
 The idea of private nuisance has been criticised by academics for at least 50 years . Criticism centres on the free rein given to the judiciary and the lack of concrete definitions for legal principles ; the idea of " reasonableness " , for examples , is frequently bandied about , but " rarely examined in detail , and it would be a brave person who would attempt to draw out a definition " . While a definition for private nuisance is easy to find , the regularly accepted one does not consider that most private nuisance cases involve two occupiers of land ; the " nuisance " has moved from the defendant 's land to the claimant 's land . Some judicial <unk> decidendi , such as that of Lord Wright in <unk> @-@ Denfield v O 'Callaghan , seem to indicate that private nuisance is only valid in situations where there are two occupiers of land . Despite this , definitions of private nuisance fail to include any reference . Academics also assert that the tort of private nuisance has " lost its separate identity as a strict liability tort and been assimilated in all but name into the fault @-@ based tort of negligence " . Conor <unk> supports the assertion that private nuisance is confused , and also claims that private nuisance is significantly different from public nuisance ; " they have little in common except the accident of sharing the same name ... Private nuisance has , if anything , become even more confused and confusing . Its chapter lies neglected in the standard works , little changed over the years , its modest message overwhelmed by the excitements to be found elsewhere in tort . Any sense of direction which may have existed in the old days is long gone " . 
 = = Public nuisance = = 
 Public nuisance concerns protecting the public , unlike private nuisance , which protects an individual . As such it is not only a tort but also a crime . In Attorney @-@ General v <unk> Quarries Ltd , it was defined by Romer LJ as any act or omission " which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty 's subjects " . Because of the wide definition given , there are a large range of issues which can be dealt with through public nuisance , including picketing on a road , as in Thomas v NUM , blocking a canal , as in Rose v Miles , or disrupting traffic by queuing in a road , as in Lyons v Gulliver . A significant difference between private and public nuisance is that under public , one can claim for personal injuries as well as damage to property . Another difference is that public nuisance is primarily a crime ; it only becomes a tort if the claimant can prove that they suffered " special damage " over and above the effects on the other affected people in the " class " . The test for the required size of a " class " was also discussed in Attorney @-@ General v <unk> Quarries Ltd , with the court concluding that the test was whether the nuisance was " so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it , but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large " . 
 Because public nuisance is primarily a criminal matter , and affects a " class " of people rather than an individual , claims are normally brought by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a " relator " , representing the affected people . Other members of the affected class are allowed to sue individually , but only if they have suffered " special damage " . The potential defendants in public nuisance claims are the same as those in private nuisance , with their liability dependent on a test of reasonableness ; in public nuisance , however , this is determined by looking solely at the interference , not the defendant 's actions . 
 = = Defences = = 
 There are several defences to nuisance claims ; in Nichols v Marsland , for example , " Act of God " was accepted as a defence . One defence is that of " 20 years prescription " , which is valid for private nuisance but not public . If a private nuisance continues for 20 years , it becomes legal by prescription , assuming the defendant can show that it has been continuous and the claimant has been aware of it . A limitation is that the 20 years is from when the activity became a nuisance , not from when the activity started . In Sturges v Bridgman , the claimant , a doctor , lived next to a " confectionery business " . Vibrations and noises coming from this business continued for over 20 years without causing the doctor nuisance , and the doctor only complained after building a consulting room in his garden . It was held that the actual nuisance only started when the consulting room was built and the activity began to affect the doctor , not when the activity started . A second defence is statutory authority , when an activity is authorised by a piece of legislation ; this applies to both public and private nuisance . This applies even when the activity is carried out not directly in line with the statute , but intra vires . In Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd , the defendant was authorised to build an oil refinery by an Act of Parliament . The Act gave no express authority to operate it , and after it came into operation the claimant argued that it caused a nuisance through the smell and noise . The House of Lords held that it had statutory authority to operate the refinery , saying " Parliament can hardly be supposed to have intended the refinery to be nothing more than a visual adornment to the landscape in an area of natural beauty " . The statutory authority defence has recently been subject to legislative consideration in the Planning Act 2008 , which expands the defence to over 14 types of infrastructure development . 
 = = Remedies = = 
 There are three possible remedies where a claimant is found to have committed a nuisance ; injunctions , damages and abatement . Injunctions are the main remedy , and consist of an order to stop the activity causing the nuisance . They may be " perpetual " , completely forbidding the activity , or " partial " , for example limiting when the activity can take place . Damages are a monetary sum paid by the defendant for the claimant 's loss of enjoyment or any physical damage suffered ; they may be paid for things as varied as loss of sleep or any loss of comfort caused by noise or smells . Abatement is a remedy that allows the claimant to directly end the nuisance , such as trimming back a protruding hedge . If the abatement requires the claimant stepping onto the defendant 's land , he must give notice or risk becoming a trespasser .

 Starkiller , born Galen Marek and also known as The Apprentice , is the Dark Jedi anti @-@ hero protagonist of the Star Wars : The Force Unleashed project . The character 's likeness and voice are provided by Samuel Witwer . Raised by Darth Vader , he is made the secret apprentice under the name " Starkiller " due to being potent with using the Force for destructive purposes and described as less of an assassin and more of a " Force wrecking ball " . The character 's name is taken from Luke Skywalker 's original name " Annikin Starkiller " . 
 IGN called Starkiller 's story " nice and complete " . Game Informer , UGO Networks and GameDaily also gave good reviews . However , GamesRadar has criticized Starkiller 's design . In GameSpot 's vote for the greatest video game character of all time , Starkiller ( as " The Apprentice " ) was eliminated in round 1 against Niko Bellic . 
 = = Concept and creation = = 
 George Lucas motivated the team working on Star Wars : The Force Unleashed to make a brand @-@ new character . Before deciding on Starkiller 's character , other ideas for the main character included a Han Solo @-@ like smuggler , a <unk> Rebel Wookiee , " the last Skywalker " and a gadget @-@ wielding mercenary . The developers used feedback from focus test respondents and executives at LucasArts in order to make Starkiller . The developers consciously decided not to give him a name in the game , but as the novel 's author Sean Williams said he needed a name " Galen Marek " was given in the novel . 
 Starkiller was designed as Luke Skywalker 's photo @-@ negative , and is named after " Annikin Starkiller " ( Luke Skywalker 's original name in the early Star Wars early scripts ) . The developers tried to avoid making Starkiller too rigidly defined while keeping the character developed . The developers also wanted to avoid making Starkiller seem irredeemably evil , and used elements of his backstory and his relationships with other characters to balance it , while trying not to explain too much of his backstory . In order to avoid the character being over emotional , they tried to let short pieces of dialogue and looks carry scenes so that the player could interpret how Starkiller felt . They attempted to make Starkiller feel like he would belong in the classic Star Wars trilogy by making his actions faster and more intense . During an interview to Haden Blackman by The Guardian , he claimed that most of the testing players wanted the character to be ultimately redeemed by the end of the game . 
 Starkiller was voiced by and given the likeness of Samuel Witwer . According to Blackman , the staff were very hard on Witwer when casting him , but claimed he was far above the other candidates and that " he was already inhabiting the mind of this character " . Starkiller 's expressions are based on Witwer 's , which Blackman described as " a new approach for LucasArts " , noting that it " affected the way we handled casting for The Force Unleashed " and comparing it to how people see Bill Nighy as Davy Jones in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies . Blackman noted that Witwer brought new ideas and a sense of humanity to Starkiller . Sam Witwer has said that Starkiller would be a character he wouldn 't mind revisiting . 
 During the <unk> stages of Star Wars : The Force Unleashed II , the developers considered replacing the character with either a new Force wielder or a previous named Star Wars character . However , they decided to keep Starkiller as the player character as they were fond of and were attached to him and felt that there was more story that he could supply and they could build a franchise around him . Blackman commented that after deciding how to have Starkiller return , he felt " it all made sense and fell into place " . Developers tried to make The Force Unleashed more personal to Starkiller , with the game focusing on Starkiller 's search for the truth of his identity . 
 = = Characterization = = 
 Witwer compared him as being " two parts Han Solo , one part Darth Maul , one part Indiana Jones [ ... ] and then one essential part Luke Skywalker " , noting that in the character 's development " behind it all , there had to be this wide @-@ eyed kid who was trying to figure out what the hell to do " . According to Witwer , Starkiller 's characteristics and personality depended on who he was talking to and what circumstances he is in . Witwer called him " a really interesting guy , speaking of layered characters " . Although acting as a villain in the beginning of the first game , Blackman has commented how Starkiller is " really just this damaged kid . " 
 Haden Blackman noted that in the first Starkiller was a hunter , while in the second Starkiller is more a fugitive . Matt <unk> , one of the producers of The Force Unleashed II , said that the Starkiller in the second game is trying to find out " who he is " and " what it means to be human " .

Vader later betrays Starkiller and attempts to kill those he united , but Starkiller sacrifices himself for the Rebel Alliance and becomes a martyr for the rebels . During the game , he falls in love with Captain Juno Eclipse , an ex @-@ Imperial Shuttle Pilot and his own ship 's pilot . If Starkiller chooses to kill Vader rather than the Emperor at the end of the game , Starkiller becomes a minion of the Emperor and is put into a suit similar to Vader 's . Starkiller reappears in this suit in the game 's Ultimate Sith Edition , which continues the dark @-@ side path as a " what if " story .

At the end of the game , if the player chooses the light @-@ side ending , Starkiller spares Vader , capturing him , and rescues Juno . But in the dark side ending , Starkiller is stabbed just before he can kill Vader by the Dark Apprentice ( another successful clone ) trained by Vader .

 UGO Networks chose the character as the 50th top Star Wars Expanded Universe character . IGN 's Jesse Schedeen called Starkiller 's appearance in Soulcalibur IV the second best bonus character in the series , complementing his inclusion from a story standpoint as " [ Soulcalibur IV ] is about the dichotomy between good and evil , corruption and redemption , [ ... ] Starkiller is a Dark Jedi who finds himself at a crossroads . He can either follow his master and take control of the galaxy , or break away and seek out his own destiny " , with Schedeen later including Starkiller in a list of characters that would make up their idea of the ultimate fighting game . Chris Buffa also put the character as the 24th top gaming hunk , saying that " nothing compares to a bad boy " . Jesse Schedeen called Starkiller one of the most promising player characters to be released during fall 2008 .

 = M @-@ 140 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 140 is a north – south state trunkline highway in Berrien and Van Buren counties of the US state of Michigan . The highway starts in the Niles area at M @-@ 139 and runs north through Watervliet to South Haven , ending at Interstate 196 / US Highway 31 ( I @-@ 196 / US 31 ) . In between , it runs through farm fields and past lakes in the southwestern part of the Lower Peninsula . The trunkline is used , on average , by between 1 @,@ 500 and 10 @,@ 200 vehicles . 
 The state designated M @-@ 140 in the early 1930s over a previous alignment of US 31 when that highway rerouted through the area . M @-@ 140 was extended from Watervliet to Niles a few years later . Changes were made to the routing of the trunkline in the 1950s and 1960s . The last change was made in 1972 , resulting in the modern course for the highway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 140 starts at an intersection with M @-@ 139 near the St. Joseph River north of Niles and runs due north through farm fields . The trunkline jogs to the west near Steinbauer Lake before returning to the northerly course . There is another westerly jog along Pokagon Road around Riggins Lake . M @-@ 140 turns back northward and runs through the community of Berrien Center . Near Eau Claire , the highway turns bends along Maple Grove Road for about 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) before going north on Watervliet Road . East of town , the trunkline follows Main Street eastward toward the Berrien – Cass county line . M @-@ 140 intersects the northern terminus of M @-@ 62 and curves north . 
 In northern Berrien County , M @-@ 140 follows Watervliet Road to an interchange with Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) . The highway continues northward along Main Street into Watervliet , running through the middle of town and intersecting Red Arrow Highway , the former US 12 . North of downtown , the trunkline curves through residential neighborhoods to the northeast around the east end of Paw Paw Lake . M @-@ 140 crosses into western Van Buren County about five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of Watervliet . The highway crosses , and parallels , the Van Buren Trail in Covert . In South Haven Township , M @-@ 140 connects the South Haven Area Regional Airport with the I @-@ 196 / US 31 freeway ; north of this interchange , the highway continues as Business Loop I @-@ 196 . 
 M @-@ 140 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 140 were the 10 @,@ 176 vehicles daily near in Watervliet ; the lowest count was 1 @,@ 536 vehicles per day along Pokagon Road , on average . All of M @-@ 140 is a two @-@ lane , undivided highway , except sections in cities like Watervliet which may have up to four lanes . No section of the trunkline has not been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = History = = 
 The State Trunkline Highway System was created on May 13 , 1913 , by an act of the Michigan Legislature ; at the time , one of the system 's divisions corresponded to the initial segment of M @-@ 140 . Division 5 followed a course from Niles northward to Mackinaw City that encompassed the highway between Watervliet and South Haven . In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) signposted the highway system for the first time , and the future M @-@ 140 corridor was assigned to part of the original M @-@ 11 . On November 11 , 1926 , M @-@ 11 was redesignated as part of US 31 in the state . 
 In late 1931 , the state transferred US 31 to a new routing between the St. Joseph and South Haven areas ; in the process , the former route of US 31 between Watervliet and South Haven was redesignated as M @-@ 140 . The highway was extended southward from Watervliet to the Niles area in late 1934 or early 1935 . The concurrency between M @-@ 62 and M @-@ 140 was eliminated around the end of 1957 when the former highway was truncated to terminate east of Eau Claire instead of continuing west into town . At the end of the 1950s , the route north of Watervliet to the county line was realigned , smoothing several sharp curves . 
 The construction of the I @-@ 196 / US 31 freeway around the South Haven area impacted the northern terminus of M @-@ 140 in the 1960s . When it opened in 1963 , BL I @-@ 196 was shown on maps as continuing north along M @-@ 140 into town to a junction with M @-@ 43 . In 1972 , the business loop was rerouted , and M @-@ 140 was truncated to end at the freeway interchange south of town .

 = U.S. Route 40 in New Jersey = 
 U.S. Route 40 ( US 40 ) is a U.S. highway running from Park City , Utah east to Atlantic City , New Jersey . The easternmost segment of the route runs 64 @.@ 32 miles ( 103 @.@ 51 km ) through the southern part of New Jersey between the Delaware Memorial Bridge over the Delaware River in Pennsville Township , Salem County , where it continues into Delaware along with Interstate 295 ( I @-@ 295 ) , east to Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City , Atlantic County . The route passes through Salem , Gloucester , and Atlantic counties as well as the towns Woodstown , Elmer , Newfield , and Buena . The route encounters a mix of rural , suburban , and urban environs throughout its journey across South Jersey . 
 In 1923 , pre @-@ 1927 Route 18S was to run from Penns Grove to Atlantic City along much of present @-@ day US 40 in New Jersey . US 40 was signed along Route 18S in 1926 , running from a ferry in Penns Grove that crossed the Delaware River to Wilmington , Delaware . In 1927 , Route 18S was renumbered to Route 48 . The portion of US 40 in Atlantic City was legislated as Route 55 in 1938 , around the same time the route was moved to a ferry across the Delaware River between Pennsville and New Castle , Delaware . After the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike were both completed in 1951 , US 40 was moved to its current alignment in the area . In 1953 , the Route 48 and Route 55 designations along US 40 were removed . A toll freeway was once planned along the US 40 corridor in the 1980s to alleviate traffic , but it was never built after it was deemed the traffic volume was not high enough for it to be constructed .

 US 40 enters New Jersey along with I @-@ 295 from Delaware on the Delaware Memorial Bridge over the Delaware River . The road heads southeast into Salem County as an eight @-@ lane freeway maintained by the Delaware River and Bay Authority that passes through industrial areas . I @-@ 295 / US 40 interchanges with the southern terminus of US 130 and the western terminus of Route 49 , where I @-@ 295 splits from US 40 by turning northeast on a freeway that soon overlaps CR 551 briefly while US 40 follows the four @-@ lane New Jersey Turnpike and continues east on it for a short distance , entering Carneys Point Township . US 40 splits from the New Jersey Turnpike at the last exit before the toll barrier , the same point where Route 140 heads west and CR 540 heads to the east . From this point , US 40 becomes a surface four @-@ lane divided highway maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation called Wiley Road that runs a short distance south of the New Jersey Turnpike , containing a wide median . It continues into rural areas consisting of woods , farms , and residences , heading farther to the south of the New Jersey Turnpike . 
 Upon meeting the eastern terminus of Route 48 , US 40 turns to the southeast and becomes the Harding Highway , a two @-@ lane undivided road that passes through more agricultural areas . Upon crossing CR 646 , the road enters Pilesgrove Township and continues past the Cowtown Rodeo . The route passes through the residential community of Sharptown before coming to an intersection with Route 45 . At this point , US 40 turns to the northeast to run concurrent on Route 45 and enters Woodstown , where it becomes West Avenue and passes residences before reaching the downtown area . Here , Route 45 splits from US 40 by heading north on Main Street and US 40 continues to the east as East Avenue , passing more developed areas . The route crosses from Woodstown into Pilesgrove Township again , where it turns east @-@ southeast as Harding Highway and heads back into a mix of fields and woods amid homes . About 0 @.@ 17 mi ( 0 @.@ 27 km ) after entering Upper Pittsgrove Township , the road crosses CR 581 . In the community of Pole Tavern further to the east , US 40 encounters Route 77 , CR 604 , and CR 635 at the Pole Tavern Circle . Past Pole Tavern , the road passes more farm fields before coming to Elmer , where it becomes Chestnut Street . In Elmer , the route passes homes and makes a turn to the northeast onto Front Street . Upon leaving Elmer , US 40 becomes Harding Highway again and forms the border of Upper Pittsgrove Township to the north and Pittsgrove Township to the south , passing through forested areas among development . The route crosses CR 553 before passing through the community of <unk> .

 After <unk> , US 40 crosses into Franklin Township in Gloucester County , turning southeast and running through more woods . It comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 55 , where US 40 is briefly a four @-@ lane divided highway . Past Route 55 , the route continues past Malaga Lake and comes to the community of Malaga . In Malaga , the route heads into a business district and intersects Route 47 , turning to the northeast to run concurrent on a three @-@ lane road with a center left @-@ turn lane through inhabited areas . After passing over a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line , US 40 and Route 47 split . Route 47 heads north and US 40 turns south and continues parallel to the railroad tracks . The road makes a turn to the east @-@ southeast , leaving Malaga and returning to areas of farmland and trees . The road briefly runs along the northern border of Newfield before coming to a crossroads with CR 555 . After passing near the Vineland @-@ <unk> Airport , US 40 intersects CR 557 and forms a concurrency with that route . 
 = = = Atlantic County = = = 
 Immediately after CR 557 joins US 40 , the road enters Buena , Atlantic County and continues southeast into inhabited areas . After running through the commercial center of town , the road comes to the southern terminus of Route 54 and the eastern end of CR 619 in a business area located on the outskirts . At this point , it enters Buena Vista Township , and CR 557 splits form US 40 by heading to the southeast on Buena @-@ Tuckahoe Road . From this point , US 40 becomes concurrent with CR 557 Truck and enters dense woodland containing homes and businesses as well as occasional farms . The road reaches the residential community of Richland , where it encounters the eastern terminus of CR 540 and CR 622 and crosses a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line . Upon leaving Richland , the route crosses into Hamilton Township , where it runs through <unk> before heading back into forested areas and a few residential sectors . US 40 intersects the eastern terminus of CR 552 , briefly becoming a divided highway before turning east into denser inhabited areas . The highway intersects CR 559 Truck / CR 606 , at which point it becomes concurrent with CR 559 Truck . The route meets Route 50 , where CR 557 Truck splits to the south . Route 50 joins US 40 before the road crosses the Great Egg Harbor River . Upon crossing the river , the road enters Mays Landing and turns north into the downtown area . CR 559 Truck splits southbound to follow CR 617 to the east . A short distance later , the road meets CR 559 and US 40 splits from Route 50 by turning east onto that route . This intersection marks the beginning of CR 559 Truck northbound . The road passes more development before CR 559 splits from the road by heading southeast . US 40 heads east out of Mays Landing , where it continues through woodland and increasing residential development . The road widens into four lanes as it comes to US 322 ( Black Horse Pike ) near the Hamilton Mall . At this point , US 40 forms a concurrency with US 322 , which lasts for the remainder of the route . 
 The two routes continue to the southeast through business areas , meeting CR 575 and a ramp to the Atlantic City Expressway . CR 575 turns east to follow US 40 / US 322 . The road enters Egg Harbor Township , and CR 575 splits from US 40 / US 322 by turning to the south . The route passes more wooded residential and commercial areas , as well as the Storybook Land amusement park , before intersecting CR 563 . US 40 / US 322 forms a concurrency with that route and passes through a business district that includes the Harbor Square shopping center . CR 563 splits from the road by continuing southeast and the Black Horse Pike heads east interchange with the Garden State Parkway . The only direct ramp present is between the Black Horse Pike westbound and the Garden State Parkway northbound ; all other movements are provided by CR 563 . Past here , US 40 / US 322 continues east past more businesses , crossing CR 651 before entering Pleasantville . In Pleasantville , the road crosses US 9 , where the name changes to Verona Avenue . Upon crossing CR 585 , the Black Horse Pike continues past residences as an undivided road , crossing back into Egg Harbor Township . The road passes more businesses , closely paralleling the Atlantic City Expressway before entering Atlantic City . Here , the name becomes Albany Avenue and it comes to a pair of ramps that provide access to and from the Black Horse Pike eastbound and the Atlantic City Expressway westbound . US 40 / US 322 enters marshland , crossing the Great Thorofare onto Great Island before passing over the Beach Thorofare . Past this bridge , the road passes between businesses to the west and the closed Bader Field airport and the abandoned Bernie Robbins Stadium to the east . US 40 / US 322 crosses the Inside Thorofare on a drawbridge and continues as a county maintained road to its end at Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue , one block from the boardwalk . Through New Jersey , US 40 serves as a main road connecting Atlantic City with points south along Interstate 95 , such as Baltimore and Washington , D.C.

 The portion of US 40 that overlaps US 322 follows the Black Horse Pike , a turnpike established in 1855 that was to run from Camden to Atlantic City via Blackwoodtown . In 1923 , pre @-@ 1927 Route 18S was created along the current alignment of US 40 east of the Route 48 intersection , running from Penns Grove to Atlantic City . When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926 , the alignment of US 40 in New Jersey ran from Penns Grove , where a ferry carried the route across the Delaware River to Wilmington , Delaware , east to Atlantic City along pre @-@ 1927 Route 18S . In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering that occurred a year later , pre @-@ 1927 Route 18S was replaced by Route 48 . In 1936 , US 322 was also signed concurrent with US 40 on the Black Horse Pike . The portion of US 40 / US 322 that existed in Atlantic City was legislated as Route 55 in 1938 . Also by 1938 , US 40 was moved to a ferry that ran across the Delaware River between Pennsville and New Castle , Delaware , following current Route 49 , local roads , and CR 551 to travel between the ferry and Route 48 . Following the completion of the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951 , US 40 was moved to the new bridge and routed to follow a small portion of the New Jersey Turnpike and Wiley Road to the current eastern terminus of Route 48 . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , which eliminated concurrencies between U.S. highways and state routes , Route 48 was removed from the portion of US 40 east of its current eastern terminus and the Route 55 designation was dropped entirely . 
 In the 1980s , Congressman William J. Hughes proposed a freeway along the US 40 corridor in order to alleviate increased traffic along that route following the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City . This freeway , which was to be maintained by the New Jersey Expressway Authority , was to run from the Delaware Memorial Bridge east to Atlantic City . The NJDOT determined that the traffic volume on US 40 did not justify the construction of a freeway along the corridor . The Cardiff Circle along US 40 / US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $ 3 @.@ 7 million project completed in 2002 . 
 In 2013 , the road was one of three that tied for the # 1 ranking on the Tri @-@ State Transportation Campaign 's list of the top ten most dangerous roads for pedestrians in New Jersey , New York and Connecticut . The route , along with U.S. Route 130 ( Burlington Pike ) in Burlington County and U.S. Route 1 in Middlesex County , were so ranked due to the nine pedestrian deaths that occurred on each of those roads from 2009 to 2011 .

 = Buckton Castle = 
 Buckton Castle is a medieval ringwork near Carrbrook , Stalybridge , England . It is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument due to its proximity to the Buckton Vale Quarry . The castle is oval , with a stone curtain wall 3 metres ( 10 ft ) wide , surrounded by a ditch 10 metres ( 33 ft ) wide and 6 metres ( 20 ft ) deep . Buckton Castle was probably constructed for William de Neville in the late 12th century ; it was lying derelict by 1360 . The small number of finds retrieved during archaeological investigation of the site indicates that Buckton Castle may not have been completed . 
 In the 16th century , the site was used as a beacon for the Pilgrimage of Grace . During the 18th century , the castle was of interest to treasure hunters following rumours of the presence of buried treasure . It was used as an anti @-@ aircraft decoy site in the Second World War . The castle is overgrown with heather and peat , and there are no above @-@ ground ruins . Since 1996 , the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit has been involved in excavations to maintain the site and reveal more information on its origins and purpose .
