 In October 1899 , Rhodes , aged 22 , married Sarah Elizabeth Stancliffe , who lived in Kirkheaton and was two years his senior . They lived in a farmhouse , shared with other people , at Bog Hall near Kirkheaton . On 25 August 1902 his wife gave birth to a daughter , their only child . Rhodes found Yorkshire 's dealings with money to be ungenerous ; following his benefit in 1911 Yorkshire , as was their custom , paid only one @-@ third of the money to Rhodes and kept back the rest to invest on his behalf , only paying out the interest . Rhodes considered this to be unfair ; however , he was able to use the money to build a stone house at Marsh , Huddersfield , which his family moved into in the autumn of 1912 . He lived there until 1956 . 
 From around 1936 Rhodes 's sight began to fail , and on the outbreak of war in 1939 he was unable to take up a wartime job . Eventually a specialist diagnosed glaucoma , but at that stage nothing could be done . Rhodes was still able to see well enough to watch cricket and play golf , although by 1946 he was unable to read a newspaper . Another specialist was consulted in 1951 and an operation performed , but by 1952 Rhodes was completely blind . The build @-@ up of pain led to the removal of his left eyeball in 1958 . In 1950 , Sarah Rhodes suffered a heart attack , which limited the help she could give to her husband ; in 1954 she died a few months before her 80th birthday . Rhodes then sold his house at Marsh and moved in with his daughter and her husband , with whom he later moved to Bournemouth . He continued to attend cricket matches where he was able to follow the play despite his blindness , and was frequently sought out by cricketers and asked for his advice or opinion . Rhodes was given honorary life membership of Yorkshire in 1946 , and of the MCC in 1949 . When given membership of the MCC , along with other old professionals , Rhodes reacted characteristically ; rather than showing pleasure , he responded , " I don 't rightly know what it means yet . " He died in 1973 , aged 95 . 
 = Curtis Joseph = 
 Curtis Shayne " <unk> " Joseph ( born Curtis Munro ; April 29 , 1967 ) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former professional player . He last played for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League during the 2008 – 09 NHL season . 
 Joseph is immediately recognizable on the ice for his masks featuring a snarling dog , drawing inspiration from the Stephen King novel Cujo , which also happens to be his nickname , derived from the first two letters of his first and last names . Throughout his NHL career , Joseph played for a number of franchises , rising to prominence during the playoffs with the St. Louis Blues , Edmonton Oilers , and Toronto Maple Leafs . He has also played for the Detroit Red Wings , Phoenix Coyotes and Calgary Flames . He was also a member of Canada 's gold medal winning team at the 2002 Winter Olympics . 
 Joseph has the most career wins ( 454 ) of any goaltender in NHL history who never played on a Stanley Cup @-@ winning team , and also the first goaltender to have 30 or more wins in a regular season for five different teams . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Joseph was born on April 29 , 1967 to unmarried teenage parents . Five days after his birth , his mother , Wendy Munro , placed him for adoption with Jeanne Joseph , a nurse who had befriended her during her hospital stay , and her husband Harold Joseph . Jeanne and her husband decided to name the baby Curtis after his birth father Curtis <unk> . Curtis grew up with an older stepbrother Grant and a stepbrother Victor ; he also has three older stepsisters and a step brother from a previous marriage . The family was of mixed race with Harold and Victor being black . It was not until he signed with the St. Louis Blues that Joseph legally changed his name from Curtis Shayne Munro to Curtis Shayne Joseph . 
 For the majority of his childhood , Curtis was raised in East Gwillimbury ( community of Sharon ) . He initially attended Whitchurch Highlands Public School and then Huron Heights Secondary School . Curtis grew up playing hockey for the East Gwillimbury Eagles of the OMHA until moving west to play for his high school team , Notre Dame College ( Wilcox , Saskatchewan ) Although he led the Notre Dame Hounds to the Centennial Cup in 1987 @-@ 88 , and he played for the University of Wisconsin – Madison of the NCAA , he was undrafted by the NHL . He signed as a free agent with the Blues in 1989 . In 1989 – 90 season he played 23 games with the Peoria Rivermen in the IHL .

 Joseph is nicknamed " Cujo " and has worn the number 31 for the St. Louis Blues , Edmonton Oilers , Toronto Maple Leafs , Detroit Red Wings , Phoenix Coyotes and the Calgary Flames . Joseph is a three time NHL All @-@ Star ( 1994 , 1999 , 2000 ) , and he was awarded the 1999 – 2000 King Clancy Memorial Trophy for exemplifying leadership qualities on and off the ice and making noteworthy humanitarian contributions to his community . In the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City , he was a member of the Olympic Gold Medal winning Canadian men 's hockey team .

 Curtis Joseph began his college play at the University of Wisconsin . While playing for the Badgers , Joseph won 21 games and was voted to the WCHA All Conference Team . Shortly after his freshman season , Joseph , despite not having been drafted , was signed by the St. Louis Blues to a free @-@ agent entry @-@ level contract . 
 = = = St. Louis Blues = = = 
 Joseph broke into the NHL in 1989 , playing for the St. Louis Blues . In the off @-@ season following the 1990 – 91 NHL season , the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils . Shanahan was a restricted free agent , and thus the Devils were entitled to compensation . The teams could not agree on what the compensation was ; the Blues offered Curtis Joseph , Rod Brind 'Amour , and two draft picks , while the Devils wanted Scott Stevens . Joseph seemed to be the answer the Devils were looking for in goal , however the case went to arbitration , and a judge ruled that Stevens was to be awarded to the Devils in September 1991 . 
 Joseph would remain with the Blues until 1995 . The 1992 – 93 NHL season was his most successful season as he played a key role in the upset of the Chicago Blackhawks , the reigning Clarence Campbell Conference regular season champions , sweeping them in four games in the first round of the playoffs . The Blues then faced the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second round and thanks to Joseph the series went to seven games . The Leafs eventually prevailed . Because of his efforts , he was nominated as a finalist for the Vezina Trophy that season , finishing third in voting behind winner Ed Belfour and Tom Barrasso .

 In 1995 , he was traded ( with Mike Grier ) to the Edmonton Oilers for a first @-@ round pick in the 1996 entry draft ( eventually Marty Reasoner ) and a first @-@ round pick in the 1997 entry draft . With Edmonton , Joseph won two Zane Feldman Trophies ( team MVP ) and one Most Popular Player award . He backstopped the Oilers to first round playoff upsets of the Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche in 1997 and 1998 , respectively , their first playoff series wins since 1992 . 
 = = = Toronto Maple Leafs = = = 
 Following the 1997 – 98 season , Joseph signed as a free agent with the Toronto Maple Leafs , a move which made him unpopular in Edmonton . In his first road game against Edmonton as a member of the Leafs , Joseph posted a shutout and was named the first star of the game . Throughout the game , he was greeted with boos , however , he was cheered by the fans in Edmonton upon being announced the first star of the game due to being a fan favourite . It was with the Leafs that Joseph became a superstar and he was consistently one of the most popular players of both his team ( since Wendel Clark and Doug Gilmour ) and in the league . While with the Leafs , he had three consecutive seasons of 30 + wins , he was twice runner @-@ up for the Vezina Trophy in 1999 and 2000 , a finalist for the Lester B. Pearson Award in 1999 , and won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy in 2000 . The NHL Awards presentation was held in Toronto in both 1999 and 2000 , both years that Joseph was runner @-@ up for the Vezina . When Dominik Hasek was announced the winner in 1999 and again when Olaf <unk> was announced the winner in 2000 , the audience in Toronto booed loudly , and also broke out into chants of " Cujo , Cujo ! " . Joseph played a key role in the Leafs ' run to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1999 and 2002 . In 2000 , during Game One of the series against the New Jersey Devils , he was considered the deciding factor in the 2 @-@ 1 win where the Leafs were outshot 33 @-@ 21 . [ 1 ] 
 After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn was unwilling to give Joseph a four @-@ year contract ( he offered three years ) , he left after the 2001 – 2002 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings . Some also speculated that the relationship between Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game , although Joseph himself denied the rumours , saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden ( losing 5 @-@ 2 ) and that Martin Brodeur played very well for the rest of the tournament , earning his spot as the starter . Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that could win it all , implying the Leafs were not such a team . Joseph 's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto . 
 = = = Detroit Red Wings = = = 
 Joseph moved to the Detroit Red Wings , who had just won the Stanley Cup . Joseph initially was not popular with Red Wings fans but eventually found his form in the latter half of the 2002 – 03 season to backstop his team to the division title . Detroit was upset in the first round of the playoffs in 2003 by the eventual conference champions , the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim . 
 In the 2003 – 04 season , he was originally Detroit 's backup goalie when Dominik Hašek came out of retirement , and Detroit management tried to trade Joseph , since the team also had a capable backup in Manny Legace . However , Joseph 's $ 8 million USD per year contract made him hard to move . After a stint in the minors , he returned to the Red Wings lineup while Hašek was nursing a groin injury . The Red Wings plan was to attract him to other teams until Hašek returned to the lineup . But in February , Hašek decided to call it quits for the season , which once again solidified Joseph 's position as the Red Wings starting goaltender . The Wings finished first overall in the league . The Wings were defeated in the second round of the playoffs in six games by the eventual Stanley Cup finalists from the Western Conference , the Calgary Flames .

Joseph had shown interest in re @-@ joining the Toronto Maple Leafs , indicating that he would be fine with a back @-@ up role and a reduced salary . In September 2007 the Ottawa Senators quietly expressed interest in acquiring Joseph if they could unload Martin Gerber and his large contract . Joseph was a member of Team Canada in the 2007 Spengler Cup , leading them to the championship on December 31 , 2007 .

 = Swiss Bank Corporation = 
 Swiss Bank Corporation ( SBC ) ( German : Schweizerischer Bankverein ( <unk> ) , French : Société de Banque Suisse ( SBS ) , Italian : Società di Banca Svizzera ) was a large integrated financial services company located in Switzerland . Prior to its merger , the bank was the third largest in Switzerland with over <unk> billion of assets and <unk> billion of equity . 
 Throughout the 1990s , SBC engaged in a large growth initiative , shifting its focus from traditional commercial banking into investment banking , in an effort to match its larger Swiss rival Credit Suisse . As part of this strategy , SBC acquired US @-@ based investment bank Dillon Read & Co. as well as London @-@ based merchant bank S.G. Warburg in the mid @-@ 1990s . SBC also acquired Chicago @-@ based Brinson Partners and O 'Connor & Associates . These acquisitions formed the basis for a global investment banking business . 
 In 1998 , SBC merged with Union Bank of Switzerland to form UBS , the largest bank in Europe and the second largest bank in the world . The company 's logo , which featured three keys , symbolizing " confidence , security , and discretion " , was adopted by UBS after the 1998 merger . Although the combination of the two banks was billed as a merger of equals , it quickly became evident that from a management perspective , it was SBC that was buying UBS as nearly 80 % of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals . Today , what was SBC forms the core of many of UBS 's businesses , particularly UBS Investment Bank . 
 = = History = = 
 Swiss Bank Corporation traces its history to 1854 . In that year , six private banking firms in Basel , Switzerland , pooled their resources to form the Bankverein , a consortium that acted as an underwriting syndicate for its member banks . Among the original member banks were Bischoff zu St Alban , <unk> & Cie . , J. Merian @-@ <unk> , Passavant & Cie . , J. <unk> and von <unk> & Cie . The establishment of joint @-@ stock banks in Switzerland such as Swiss Bank 's earliest predecessors ( often structured as a Swiss Verein ) was driven by the industrialization of the country and the construction of railroads in the mid @-@ 19th century . 
 The Basler Bankverein was formally organized in 1872 in Basel , replacing the original Bankverein consortium . Basler Bankverein was founded with an initial commitment of <unk> million , of which <unk> million of initial share capital was paid in . Among the Bankverein 's early backers was the Bank in Winterthur , one of the early predecessors of the Union Bank of Switzerland . The bank experienced initial growing pains after heavy losses in Germany caused the bank to suspend its dividend in favor of a loss reserve . By 1879 , Basler Bankverein has accumulated enough capital to resume dividends , initially at an 8 % annual rate and then increasing to 10 % in 1880 . 
 Basler Bankverein later combined with Zürcher Bankverein in 1895 to become the Basler & Zürcher Bankverein . The next year , Basler Depositenbank and Schweizerische Unionbank were acquired . After the take @-@ over of the Basler Depositenbank , the bank changes its name to Schweizerischer Bankverein ( Swiss Bank ) . The English name of the bank was changed to Swiss Bank Corporation in 1917 . 
 = = = 1900 – 1939 = = = 
 SBC continued to grow in the early decades of the 20th century , acquiring weaker rivals . In 1906 , SBC purchased Banque d <unk> , Fatio & Cie , establishing a branch in Geneva , Switzerland , for the first time . Two years later , in 1908 , the bank acquired Fratelli <unk> , a bank in Chiasso , Switzerland , its first representation in the Italian @-@ speaking portion of the country . This was followed by the 1909 acquisition of Bank für Appenzell ( est . 1866 ) and the 1912 acquisition of Banque d <unk> et de <unk> . 
 The onset of World War I put a hold on much of the bank 's development . Although SBC survived the war intact , it suffered the loss of its investments in a number of large industrial companies . Nevertheless , the bank surpassed CHF1 billion for the first time at the end of 1918 and grew to 2 @,@ 000 employees by 1920 . In 1918 , SBC purchased <unk> <unk> SA <unk> to refine precious metals and produce bank <unk> the company would be established as a separate subsidiary in 1936 and spun off in 1998 . The impact of the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression would be severe , particularly as the Swiss franc suffered major devaluation in 1936 . The bank would see its assets fall from a 1929 peak of <unk> billion to its 1918 levels of CHF1 billion by 1936 . 
 In 1937 , SBC adopted its three keys logo symbolizing confidence , security and discretion . The logo was designed by a Swiss artist and illustrator , <unk> Honegger @-@ Lavater . 
 = = = Activities in World War II = = = 
 On the eve of World War II , SBC was the recipient of large influxes of foreign funds for safekeeping . Just prior to the outbreak of World War II , in 1939 , Swiss Bank Corporation made the timely decision to open an office in New York City . The office was able to begin operations , located in the Equitable Building , just weeks after the outbreak of the war and was intended as a safe place to store assets in case of an invasion . During the war , the bank 's traditional business fell off and the Swiss government became its largest client . Overall , SBC saw its business grow as a result of its wartime government underwriting business . 
 Decades after the war , it was demonstrated that Swiss Bank Corporation likely took an active role in trading stolen gold , securities and other assets during World War II . 
 In 1997 , the World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks ( WJC ) was launched to retrieve deposits made by victims of Nazi persecution during and prior to World War II . Negotiations involving SBC 's successor UBS , Credit Suisse , the World Jewish Congress and Stuart Eizenstat , on behalf of the US , ultimately resulted in a settlement of US $ 1 @.@ 25 billion in August 1998 paid by the two large Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse . The settlement , which coincided with UBS 's merger with Swiss Bank , together with the bank 's embarrassment in the Long Term Capital Management collapse in 1998 brought a degree of closure to the issue . 
 = = = 1945 – 1990 = = = 
 Swiss Bank Corporation found itself in relatively strong financial condition at the end of World War II , with <unk> billion of assets . By contrast , the Basler Handelsbank ( Commercial Bank of Basel ) , founded in 1862 and one of the largest banks in Switzerland , was insolvent at the end of the war and was consequently acquired by SBC in 1945 . SBC remained among the Swiss government 's leading underwriters of debt in the post @-@ war years . However , by 1947 SBC was shifting its focus back to its traditional business of lending money principally to private companies as part of the postwar rebuilding of Europe . Meanwhile , the firm continued its expansion to international markets , particularly the United States where SBC focused primarily on commercial banking for corporate clients . Within Switzerland , SBC remained a full @-@ service bank with a domestic retail banking network and an asset management business . 
 SBC prospered throughout the 1950s and embarked on a period of sustained growth . The bank , which had entered the 1950s with 31 Branch Offices in Switzerland and three abroad , more than doubled its assets from the end of the war to <unk> billion by the end of the 1950s and doubled assets again by the mid @-@ 1960s , exceeding <unk> billion in 1965 . SBC acquired Banque Populaire <unk> , Sion , Switzerland , and the Banque Populaire de Sierre . The firm continued to open new offices in the US in the mid @-@ 1960s and it was also at this time that SBC began to expand into Asia and opened representative offices throughout Latin America . The bank opened a full branch office in Tokyo in 1970 . The bank also made a number of acquisitions to enhance its position in various products . SBC acquired a controlling interest in Frei , <unk> & Cie. in 1968 , <unk> Bank in 1970 and Bank <unk> in 1979 ( later sold to GE Capital in 1997 ) . All three banks focused on consumer lending . Similarly , SBC acquired a number of banks in the private banking sector , including <unk> & Cie. in 1974 ; Armand von Ernst & Cie. and Adler & Co. in 1976 ; and a majority interest in Geneva @-@ based Ferrier <unk> & Cie. in 1978 . The bank continued its consolidation of Swiss banks acquiring Banque <unk> de Sion in 1978 and in 1979 acquired <unk> Basle , the Banca <unk> SA and Bank für <unk> . 
 As its own home market was highly competitive , SBC focused on commercial banking for American and other multinational companies . Through 1979 , SBC was consistently the largest of the three major Swiss Bank by assets , except for short periods in 1962 and 1968 when UBS temporarily moved ahead of SBC . After 1979 , although its balance sheet had grown to <unk> billion of assets , the bank would typically rank second to UBS which firmly established itself as the largest Swiss bank in the 1980s . SBC would retain this position for the next 15 years until Credit Suisse leapfrogged into the top spot following its 1995 acquisitions of Schweizerische Volksbank and Winterthur Group . 
 = = = Aggressive acquisitions ( 1990 – 1998 ) = = = 
 Swiss Bank began the 1990s as the weakest of the " Big Three " Swiss banks but by the end of 1997 would be the driving force behind the merger with Union Bank of Switzerland . SBC had been impacted by losses on its real estate investments and a series of minor controversies , despite the bank 's historically conservative posture . Beginning in the 1980s , SBC along with its Swiss peers began to embrace a more aggressive strategy to keep up with competitors in the US , Japan , Germany and the UK . The bank signaled its new posture in 1990 when it opened its new US headquarters , Swiss Bank Tower , a 29 floor building on 49th Street , adjoining Saks Fifth Avenue . 
 SBC shifted its focus from traditional commercial banking toward investment banking with an emphasis on building its trading operations . To bolster its trading initiative , in 1992 , SBC acquired O 'Connor & Associates , a Chicago @-@ based options trading firm , with an expertise in financial derivatives . O 'Connor was founded in 1977 by mathematician Michael Greenbaum and was named for Edmund ( Ed ) and Williams ( Bill ) O 'Connor . The O 'Connor brothers had made a fortune trading grain on the Chicago Board of Trade and founded a First Options , a clearing house business . The O <unk> provided Greenbaum , who had run risk management for First Options , with the capital to start his own firm . SBC had established a strategic relationship with O 'Connor , which was the largest market maker in the financial options exchanges in the US , beginning in 1988 . O 'Connor had been looking to partner with a larger financial institution and in 1989 entered into a currency joint venture with SBC that proved to be the first step towards a sale of O 'Connor to SBC . Following the merger , O 'Connor was combined with SBC 's money market , capital market and currency market activities to form a globally integrated capital markets and treasury operation . A number of O 'Connor executives were brought into key positions within the bank in an attempt to cultivate a more entrepreneurial culture at SBC . 
 In 1994 , SBC followed up its acquisition of O 'Connor by acquiring Brinson Partners an asset management firm focused on providing access for US institutions to global markets . Founded by Gary P. Brinson , an innovator in financial management , Brinson Partners had emerged as one of largest managers of pension plans and also managed a series of mutual funds . Brinson was a pioneer in the development of the theory of asset allocation which had largely become conventional wisdom among money managers in the 1980s and 1990s . Brinson had begun working at First Chicago Corporation in the 1970s and by 1981 began building the business that would become Brinson Partners . In 1989 , Brinson led a US $ 100 million management buyout of his firm from First Chicago Corporation and over the next five years built up the firm to approximately US $ 36 billion of assets under management . SBC paid US $ 750 million to acquire Brinson Partners , which resulted in a profit to Brinson and his partners of US $ 460 million on the sale of their 75 % stake in the company . Following the acquisition of Brinson Partners , Gary Brinson ran SBC 's asset management business and after the merger with UBS , Brinson was named chief investment officer of UBS Global Asset Management . 
 SBC 's next made a major push into investment banking with the acquisition of S.G. Warburg & Co. a leading British investment banking firm in 1995 for US $ 1 @.@ 4 billion . S.G. Warburg was founded by Siegmund Warburg , a member of the Warburg banking family . After World War II , S.G. Warburg established a reputation as a daring merchant bank that grew to be one of the most respected investment banks in London . Following a flawed and costly expansion into the US , in 1994 a merger was announced with Morgan Stanley , but the talks collapsed . The following year S.G. Warburg was purchased by Swiss Bank Corporation , . The bank merged S.G. Warburg with its own existing investment banking unit to create SBC Warburg , which became a leading player in global investment banking . 
 Two years later , in 1997 , SBC paid US $ 600 million to acquire Dillon , Read & Co . , a white shoe US investment banking firm considered to be a member of the bulge bracket . Dillon , Read , which traced its roots to the 1830s was among the powerhouse firms on Wall Street in the 1920s and 1930s and by the 1990s had a particularly strong mergers and acquisitions advisory group . Dillon Read had been in negotiations to sell itself to ING which owned 25 % of the firm already , however Dillon Read partners balked at ING 's integration plans . After its acquisition by SBC , Dillon Read was merged with SBC @-@ Warburg to create SBC @-@ Warburg Dillon Read . The Dillon Read name was discontinued after the merger with Union Bank of Switzerland although it was brought back in 2005 as Dillon Read Capital Management , UBS 's ill @-@ fated hedge fund operations . 
 = = = Merger with Union Bank of Switzerland = = = 
 Aggressively pushing ahead its various acquisitions , UBS was mired in a series of entanglements with activist shareholders who were critical of bank 's relatively conservative management . Martin Ebner , through his investment trust , BK Vision became the largest shareholder in UBS and attempted to force a major restructuring of the bank ’ s operations . The groundwork for the merger of SBC and UBS was actually laid by their mutual competitor , Credit Suisse which had approached UBS about a merger that would have created the second largest bank in the world in 1996 . UBS 's management and board unanimously rebuffed the proposed merger . Ebner , who supported the idea of a merger , led a major shareholder revolt that resulted in the replacement of UBS 's chairman , Robert Studer . Studer 's successor Mathis Cabiallavetta would be one of the key architects of the merger with SBC . 
 On December 8 , 1997 , Union Bank of Switzerland and SBC announced an all stock merger . At the time of the merger , Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation were the second and third largest banks in Switzerland , respectively , both trailing Credit Suisse . Discussions between the two banks had begun several months earlier , less than a year after rebuffing Credit Suisse 's merger overtures . 
 The all @-@ stock merger resulted in the creation UBS AG , a huge new bank with total assets of more than US $ 590 billion . Also referred to as the " New UBS " to distinguish itself from the former Union Bank of Switzerland , the combined bank became the second largest in the world , at that time , behind only the Bank of Tokyo @-@ Mitsubishi . Additionally , the merger pulled together the banks ' various asset businesses to create the world 's largest money manager , with approximately US $ 910 billion in assets under management . 
 The merger , which was billed as a merger of equals , resulted in SBC 's shareholders receiving 40 % of the bank 's common shares and Union Bank 's shareholders receiving 60 % of the combined company . SBC 's Marcel Ospel was named chief executive officer while Union Bank 's Mathis Cabiallavetta became chairman of the new bank . However , it quickly became evident that from a management perspective , it was SBC that was buying UBS as nearly 80 % of the top management positions were filled by legacy Swiss Bank professionals . Additionally , UBS professionals suffered more headcount reductions , particularly in the investment banking unit where there were heavy cuts in the corporate finance and equities businesses . Prior to the merger , Swiss Bank Corporation had built a global investment banking business , Warburg Dillon Read through its acquisitions of Dillon Read in New York and S.G. Warburg in London . SBC was generally considered to be further along than UBS in developing its international investment banking business , particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where Warburg Dillon Read was considered to be the more established platform . 
 After the merger was completed , it was widely speculated that a series of losses suffered by UBS on its equity derivative positions in late 1997 provided SBC with the leverage it required to consummate the merger . It would become clear that the derivatives losses prompted UBS to accept the terms proposed by SBC more readily than they otherwise would have . 
 = = = After the merger = = = 
 UBS , the successor of the Union Bank of Switzerland , is among the largest diversified financial institutions in the world . As of 2010 , UBS operated in all of the major financial centers worldwide with offices in over 50 countries and 64 @,@ 000 employees globally . 
 In November 2000 , UBS merged with Paine Webber an American stock brokerage and asset management firm led by chairman and CEO , Donald Marron . The acquisition pushed UBS to the top Wealth and Asset Management Firm in the world . Initially the business was given the divisional name " UBS PaineWebber " but in 2003 the 123 @-@ year @-@ old name Paine Webber disappeared when it was renamed " UBS Wealth Management USA . " 
 The bank would grow considerably in the 2000s , building a large investment banking franchise to compete with the major US and European bulge bracket firms . However , UBS suffered major setbacks in 2007 , 2008 and 2009 . UBS suffered among the largest losses of any European bank during the subprime mortgage crisis and the bank was required to raise large amounts of outside capital from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation , the Swiss government and through a series of equity offerings in 2008 and 2009 .

 = Adam ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) = 
 Adam is a fictional character in the fourth season of the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer . Portrayed by George Hertzberg , he is a monster created from a man and the collected parts of demons , vampires , and technology : the product of a perverse experiment carried out by military scientists . The series ' main character , Buffy Summers , encounters and ultimately defeats him in the fourth season . Adam is the creation of Dr. Maggie Walsh ( Lindsay Crouse ) , the head of a military @-@ like organization called The Initiative that studies how to alter the harmful behavior inherent to demons . Adam and the Initiative are the fourth season 's primary antagonists , or Big Bad . 
 The premise of the series is that Buffy ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) is a Slayer , endowed with superhuman strength to fight vampires and evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale . In the fourth season , Buffy begins attending college , where she discovers that her psychology professor , Walsh , is a scientist for the Initiative . Adam is Dr. Walsh 's horrible masterpiece , an allusion to Frankenstein 's monster , whose first conscious act is killing his creator . Adam 's search for understanding himself and his true nature , combined for his penchant for chaos , leads him to orchestrate a massacre between demons and humans , after which he will be able use body parts leftover from the melee to create an army of monsters to set loose on Sunnydale . Buffy 's effectiveness as a Slayer is increased because her close friends and family , called the Scooby Gang , assist her in her battles . By the end of season four the members of the group have become estranged and must come back together in order to defeat the apparently invincible Adam . 
 Buffy studies scholars have critically examined the character of Adam , noting that he is a clear reference to Frankenstein 's monster . Throughout the action of the novel , the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created , much like Adam . Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective , directing George Hertzberg to " find the stillness " in the character . The presence of Adam also serves to questioning tradition and authority , specifically institutional authority , which is a repeated theme on the show . Adam has a " design flaw " : Adam supplants Dr. Walsh 's existence with technology , finding her unnecessary and killing her — an act of questioning authority . Critical reception to Adam has been largely mixed , with critics ' opinions ranging from negative to positive . Some commentators felt his subplot was confusing and unconvincing . Others enjoyed the concept and praised the make @-@ up and special effects used to create the character .

 Adam makes his first appearance on the thirteenth episode of season four , " The I in Team " . The first twelve episodes of the season establish the overarching themes , with increasing focus on the mysterious activities of the Initiative . Buffy and Willow begin attending college , an experience which overwhelms Buffy immediately as she finds herself far outside her comfort zone . In the season premiere , Buffy and Willow begin attending a challenging psychology class taught by Dr. Maggie Walsh ( Lindsay Crouse ) . She also meets Dr. Walsh 's teaching assistant Riley Finn ( Marc Blucas ) and they become attracted to each other . Riley is in charge of a military commando organization that hunts vampires and demons , and captures them for research . It is not revealed to audiences that Dr. Walsh is the head of the research branch of Riley 's military organization , called the Initiative , until the seventh episode . 
 The Initiative 's goals are gradually made clearer . A recurring character since the second season is Spike ( James Marsters ) , a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past , depending on what suits his interests . Recently wanting to kill Buffy , Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them , or even to fight them . Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative , spending more time with Riley , and trying to impress Dr. Walsh . At different times , Willow , Xander , and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative 's true motives and there are questions about their mission that are unanswered . Buffy begins asking questions during " The I in Team " . After being sent after a <unk> demon , a being with a skewer in its arm , she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons . Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh — who answers to no one — then cement Dr. Walsh 's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative . After a botched attempt to kill Buffy , Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project , Adam who is laying on a table , apparently unconscious . Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm — the one taken off the <unk> demon . His first word is " Mommy " , which he says as Dr. Walsh falls to the floor , dead . 
 Riley , meanwhile , learns of Dr. Walsh 's death and his comrades Forrest ( Leonard Roberts ) and Graham ( Bailey Chase ) suspect Buffy to be her murderer . Extremely agitated and showing signs of drug withdrawal , he follows Buffy and demands to know the truth in " Goodbye Iowa " . None of them are aware of Adam until he re @-@ emerges in the underground laboratories of the Initiative , killing Dr. Walsh 's assistant and another soldier . He tells Riley that he knows Dr. Walsh created them both , that she gave Riley chemicals to strengthen him , which makes them brothers . When Riley refuses to acknowledge their bond , Adam skewers Riley , and knocks Buffy across the room while Forrest and Graham are trying to enter the locked door . Adam leaves and the Initiative are tasked with hunting him down and killing him . When one of Sunnydale 's residents , Jonathan Levinson ( Danny Strong ) , casts a spell making him the center of everyone 's attention in " Superstar " , Adam is the only character in town who realizes it is an illusion . He explains his insight by saying he is " aware " . His uniqueness has set him apart . Adam is interested in how the illusion will play out , however , and watches it unfold . During the illusion , Jonathan — temporarily a part of the <unk> — discovers Adam 's only weakness : a uranium power core source which , effectively , will never allow him to die . 
 Spike simultaneously discovers Adam to be communicating with the town 's demon underworld , asking for favors through a charisma he has over them . Adam promises if Spike can drive apart Buffy and Riley and their friends , he will remove Spike 's microchip . The plan to drive Buffy , Willow , Xander , and Giles apart works for a while ; at their lowest , the four refuse to speak to each other , but each of them realizes in " Primeval " that they were manipulated by Spike and return , apologetic . They realize that Adam has been orchestrating the capture of the town 's vampires and demons so he can release them in the Initiative ; the Initiative 's holding cells are becoming overcrowded and the soldiers spread very thin and overworked . The soldiers and demons will then proceed to kill each other . Adam then intends to use the resulting carnage to create an army of monsters much like himself . 
 Buffy , Willow , Xander , and Giles realize they must work as one unit to defeat Adam . They are captured sneaking into the Initiative , but Adam trips the power , releasing all the demons and a fight breaks out all over the facility . Buffy , Willow , Xander , and Giles get themselves into a room adjacent to 314 as Willow starts to cast the spell to join them all temporarily . Riley distracts Adam 's demonoid minions while Buffy confronts Adam . However , Adam , after modulating his arm to dispense a minigun , is able to overpower her . Suddenly , the spell begins to work : to function as one unit , Willow becomes the spirit , Giles the mind , Xander the heart , and Buffy the hand , or strength of their ensemble . They work through Buffy to neutralize Adam , telling him " You could never hope to grasp the source of our power " . Adam , alone but intrigued , shoots at them to no avail . Adam then shoots a missile , which is changed into doves , and his gun is reverted into his arm . They are able , through Buffy , to punch inside Adam 's chest , remove his uranium core , destroying him . 
 Adam 's most significant influence following his death is in the next episode " Restless " , where the cost of defeating Adam is made apparent . Buffy 's fourth season was a first in the series in that the Scoobies ' defeat of the Big Bad did not occur in a two @-@ part grand season finale . " Primeval " is not the last episode of the season . Joss Whedon felt so strongly about the importance of the four core characters that he dedicated the finale to exploring their development . " Restless " opens with Buffy , Willow , Xander , and Giles arriving at Buffy 's mother 's house still brimming with the energy of the spell that bound them together in " Primeval " . Each of them falls asleep quickly , however , and their dreams are a pastiche of enigmatic episodes that both reveal much about each character , but also foreshadow what will occur in seasons to come . Their dreams also mirror their roles in the spell they performed to kill Adam . The magic they used to defeat the influence of science creates an inverse crisis , violating the series ' set of laws . Both Riley and Adam , now only in human form , appear in Buffy 's dream . They are wearing business suits , sitting together at a glass conference table as Buffy walks into the room , telling her they are naming things — as Adam did in the Garden of Eden — and making plans to take over the world . Buffy asks Adam what his name was before he was a monster , but he cannot tell her . Adam appears once more in the series as one of the faces of the First Evil , the seventh season 's Big Bad , in " Lessons " .

 According to the comic book series Haunted , Adam was once a human member of the Initiative tasked with protecting Professor Walsh . The ghost of Mayor Richard Wilkins , however , took over the body of a vampire , which was then captured by the Initiative . Desperate to escape , the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam . Having been one of her favorite agents , Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project . However , due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse , this chain of events may not , in fact , be canonical .

 Series writer David Fury cited graphic novel author Alan Moore 's <unk> — a story combining science fiction , mysticism , and a female superhero — as inspiration for the storyline , and another nod to Frankenstein as its original title was Frankenstein ; or , the Modern Prometheus . In addition , series creator , Joss Whedon has long been interested in science fiction . He wrote the script for the film Alien Resurrection ( 1997 ) , where an extraterrestrial creature is bred from a human and an alien in a laboratory , and went on to develop the space western television series Firefly . Buffy uses both science and magic as narrative devices . According to author Andrew <unk> , the series employs science in three ways : to demonstrate what contemporary science explains , to posit what science may be able to accomplish , and the dominance of supernatural forces over science . According to <unk> , Adam , a " <unk> redundant , bio @-@ mechanical demonoid " , is the series ' deepest exploration of scientific potential . Series writer Doug Petrie states that Adam is the embodiment of the invasion of science in a world where magic is the most powerful force . The series relied on its own form of magic to explain Buffy 's superpowers and other supernatural occurrences up to the fourth season . Adam is " what happens when people who believe in science use demons for military gain " , according to Petrie . The result is that science " gets its ass kicked " by magic . 
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer had been very successful in its first three seasons on television , but some of the characters left the series and storylines ended , creating a need for an entire shift in location and mission . Buffy and the core group of friends who fight with her graduate from high school , while the school itself was blown up in the third season finale . The fourth season , therefore , presents viewers with Buffy , her best friends Willow ( Alyson Hannigan ) , Xander ( Nicholas Brendon ) , and mentor Giles ( Anthony Head ) at a crossroads . Series creator Joss Whedon called it a " strange , sort of schizophrenic season " with a " weird incoherence " , but also stated that the episodes in the fourth season were among the series ' best . The writers set out to explore the characters ' trials as they discover more about themselves following the defining years of high school . Although they had been a cohesive group of friends in the first three seasons , situations arise in the fourth to separate them . The writers focused on each of the four core characters individually throughout the season to increase the impact of their finally coming back together in the penultimate episode , " Primeval " , when they merge their essences to form a super @-@ Buffy in order to defeat Adam . 
 George Hertzberg , a University of Southern California graduate with experience in sitcoms and commercials , was chosen based on one of Adam 's monologues he was given to read for the audition . Hertzberg counted luck and being in the right place at the right time in helping him get the role . Many recurring characters on Buffy start with one or two episodes , and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors , they often make them a regular part of the cast . Hertzberg , however , understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season . Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part , with the 6 @-@ foot @-@ 4 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) Hertzberg fitting the bill . Britt stated , " this is a guy we 're going to want eventually to have some affinity for . We can 't just see him as an evil being . He is evil to the core [ and ] should scare us with his actions ; but there 's also innocence . Like the Frankenstein monster , you realize that they 're only doing what they know . Or what they 've been programmed to do . These aren 't born creatures , these are creations . " 
 = = = Make @-@ up = = = 
 When he auditioned , Hertzberg had no idea what Adam would look like in full costume and make @-@ up . Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the materials to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid . Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part , Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam 's appearance . They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face , arms , chest , and legs , then he was fitted for contact lenses . They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close @-@ up shots . Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which , when used , had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it . The entire construction of Adam 's appearance took about two weeks . Hertzberg 's voice was also modified post @-@ production . When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume , his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex . It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume , but even after it was fully applied on set , often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras . He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney states that estrangement from the self and others is the primary theme of the fourth season . To illustrate the absolute search for identity , the series writers created Adam , who is more truly alone than is anyone else . He is a creature assembled from a man , vampires , demons , and cutting edge cybernetic technology . Adam was not the first re @-@ animated corpse to be presented in the series . " Some Assembly Required " in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster @-@ like creation and " Beauty and the Beasts " in the third includes references to Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde ; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science . Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein 's monster , who in the novel Frankenstein ( 1818 ) tells his creator that he is the " Adam of your labours " . Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress , science , and industry create for humanity . Throughout the action , the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created . Likewise , Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world , and much like Frankenstein 's monster , he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he ( Adam ) is , then murders and dissects him . Adam is a curious character , seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned , even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence . Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective , directing George Hertzberg to " find the stillness " in the character . Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg 's " flawed but impressive performance " includes Adam 's interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks , as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying . Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam 's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein 's monster : Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions , a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her . One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein , both of whom build monsters out of body parts " to compensate for human vulnerability " . The moral of Shelley 's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should . 
 Questioning tradition and authority , specifically institutional authority , is a repeated theme on the show . Buffy was created to subvert the media trope of a young , petite girl who easily falls prey to a male monster . Resisting patriarchy is exhibited in Buffy 's opposing the first season 's Master ( Mark Metcalf ) , the leader of a cult determined to cause the apocalypse , and again in the third season where exploring the issues of power and its abuse is a primary theme . Buffy opposes Sunnydale 's secretly evil Mayor ( Harry Groener ) , who is planning to transform into a giant demon and feed on the graduating class of Sunnydale High School . The military @-@ industrial complex is at the heart of the authority question in season four , again drawing comparisons to Frankenstein . Where Frankenstein 's monster had no parental love , Adam has a " design flaw " . Unlike Frankenstein 's monster , who needs his creator to make him a mate , Adam supplants Dr. Walsh 's existence with technology , finding her unnecessary and thus he kills her . Adam is the embodiment of the lack of moral guidance in pursuing scientific and technological advancement . He represents the cannibalistic nature of relentless and unchecked power : what that power wreaks comes back to devour its source . Buffy , however , subverts Shelley 's novel in the way Adam is defeated . Both Frankenstein and the monster must suffer alone . Frankenstein itself is an inversion of the Romantic era ideal of a solitary hero who must endure struggles , by portraying the monster and its creator as isolated and miserable . Buffy , as the embodiment of the postfeminist Romantic hero , further subverts this because the source of her success , according to Anita Rose , is that she fights with friends . Only then is she able to defeat Adam . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Critical reception to Adam was largely mixed , with critics ' opinions ranging from negative to positive . Nikki Stafford , in her book Bite Me ! : The 10th <unk> Guide to the World of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , was critical of Adam as well as the series doing several Frankenstein @-@ inspired episodes so close together , noting that " Some Assembly Required " was aired " just two seasons " prior . Stafford called the entire ending sequence of " Primeval " , which featured the reanimated corpses of several minor characters as well as the death of Adam , " stupid and disgusting " and wrote that the scene was a main reason she was " happily bidding adieu " to the plot involving Adam and the Initiative . Jenna Busch , in her book Joss Whedon : The Complete Companion , called Adam " one of Buffy 's least interesting Big <unk> " and argued that his story @-@ arc involving the Initiative was " rather unconvincing and somewhat off @-@ putting " . 
 Other reviews were more accepting of the character . Noel Murray from The A.V. Club was slightly more positive towards the concept of Adam . He wrote that he " love [ d ] the idea of Adam " but was having a hard time understanding the coherence of his application to the main plot . He cited inconsistencies in Adam 's existence , noting , " Adam killed Professor Walsh weeks ago , and yet The Initiative is still fully operational , and no one seems overly bothered by the fact that one of their leaders was building a monster . " Murray , however , did conclude that the show 's writers and producers " did a decent job of bringing [ the plot involving Adam ] to a conclusion " . Despite critiquing the larger plot , Murray was " always impressed with [ Adam 's ] costume / make @-@ up " . Furthermore , he was positively surprised that it " took [ him ] a minute to recognize " Adam 's appearance in " Restless " sans makeup .

 = Momchil = 
 Momchil ( Bulgarian : <unk> , Greek : <unk> [ ι ] <unk> or <unk> ; c . 1305 – 7 July 1345 ) was a 14th @-@ century Bulgarian brigand and local ruler . Initially a member of a bandit gang in the borderlands of Bulgaria , Byzantium and Serbia , Momchil was recruited by the Byzantines as a mercenary . Through his opportunistic involvement in the Byzantine civil war of 1341 – 1347 , where he played the various sides against each other , he became ruler of a large area in the Rhodopes and western Thrace . 
 Momchil achieved initial successes against Turks and Byzantines alike , setting Turkish ships on fire and almost managing to kill one of his main opponents at the time , John VI Kantakouzenos . Despite this , he was defeated and killed by a joint Byzantine – Turkish army in 1345 . Due to his opposition to the Turks , he is remembered in popular South Slavic legend as a fighter against the Turkish invasion of the Balkans . 
 = = <unk> and role in the Byzantine civil war = = 
 Contemporary and near @-@ contemporary accounts describe Momchil physically as " imposing in appearance " , " as tall as two men " and , in the words of a Turkish poet , " resembling a minaret " . According to a contemporary source , Momchil was a native of the " border area of Bulgarians and Serbs " , which at the time straddled the Rhodopes and the Pirin mountains . The claim that Momchil was born in that region may be reinforced by 15th @-@ century Ottoman registers , according to which his name was the most popular male name in that area . There exist at least a few legends which tie his birth to a particular place , for example the village of <unk> in Strandzha , though evidence is nonexistent . In any case , Momchil was born of humble origin . This was a main factor in his decision to join a band of brigands ( <unk> ) which was active in the scarcely governed border areas between Bulgaria , Byzantium and Serbia . 
 Persecuted by the Bulgarian authorities , some time before 1341 Momchil fled to Byzantium . He was accepted into the service of Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos ( r . 1328 – 1341 ) as a mercenary and tasked with the protection of the territories he previously plundered . However , his brigand activities did not cease . Momchil regularly raided Bulgarian lands , which negatively impacted Byzantine – Bulgarian relations . <unk> by the Byzantines and " detestable to the Bulgarians " , he deserted the Byzantine army and fled to Serbia to serve its ruler Stephen Dušan . In Serbia , he formed a company of 2 @,@ 000 trusted men , both Bulgarians and Serbs . 
 During the Byzantine civil war of 1341 – 1347 , Momchil joined the forces of John VI Kantakouzenos ( r . 1341 – 1354 ) , who had perhaps known Momchil during his flight to Serbia in 1342 , at the beginning of the war . In 1343 , as per the wishes of the local population , Kantakouzenos gave Momchil governance of the region of Merope in the Rhodope Mountains , a virtual no man 's land plagued by nomadic Slavic brigands . In the words of Kantakouzenos himself , the appointment was because " [ Momchil ] was of the same race these nomads would be favourably disposed toward him , but also because he was not lacking in courage and boldness in battle and was a first @-@ rate expert in robbery and plunder . " As the governor of Merope , Momchil gathered of an army of 300 cavalry and 5 @,@ 000 infantry from different nationalities . Though he considered himself able to " set against any side in the Byzantine war " , along with Umur Bey 's Turkish forces he nevertheless assisted Kantakouzenos in his campaigns in 1344 . 
 At the time , Momchil was approached by agents of Kantakouzenos ' opponents , the Constantinopolitan regency , and persuaded to turn against him . Thinking that Kantakouzenos and his Turkish allies from the Emirate of Aydin were far away in eastern Thrace , he attacked a Turkish fleet of 15 ships near <unk> and sank three of them . He then overcame another Turkish force that arrived to exact retribution near the fortress of Peritheorion ( also known as <unk> ) , and plundered several cities in the area that refused to surrender . Afterwards , Momchil along with 1 @,@ 000 horsemen attacked Kantakouzenos , who had set camp near Komotini with only 60 horsemen to protect him . The Byzantines were thoroughly routed : Kantakouzenos ' horse was killed and he received a powerful hit to the head , which he survived thanks to his helmet . Momchil captured many of Kantakouzenos ' men , but the claimant to the throne himself managed to escape in the turmoil . 
 Soon , however , Momchil sent messages to Kantakouzenos asking for forgiveness . The latter , loath to alienate Momchil and open another front in his rear , pardoned him in exchange for promises of future good conduct , and even awarded him the title of sebastokrator . Momchil nevertheless continued to entertain parallel ties with the regency , and even secured the title of despotes from the Empress Anna of Savoy . 
 = = Ruler in the Rhodopes and death = = 
 In the summer of 1344 , Momchil finally broke with both parties and seceded from the Byzantine Empire . He proclaimed himself an independent ruler in the Rhodopes and the Aegean coast , " capturing cities and villages and appearing all @-@ powerful and invincible " . With his army he captured Xanthi , which became the capital of his domain . Bulgarian historian Plamen Pavlov theorises that Momchil was in friendly relations with Bulgarian emperor Ivan Alexander ( r . 1331 – 1371 ) , with whom he shared a lengthy border , and believes the two may have acted in co @-@ ordination against the Byzantines . 
 In late spring 1345 however , Kantakouzenos , reinforced with allegedly 20 @,@ 000 troops from Aydin under their ruler Umur Bey , marched against Momchil . Momchil tried to prevent this by asking again for pardon and offering to submit to Kantakouzenos , but the emperor refused to heed him . 
 The two armies met near Peritheorion on 7 July 1345 . Momchil tried to seek refuge behind the city 's walls — scholars debate whether he actually held the city or not — but they were shut against him and his men by the locals . The locals did let in Momchil 's cousin <unk> along with 50 men , which they hoped would persuade Momchil not to take vengeance on the city if he defeated his opponents . In the subsequent battle before the city walls , Momchil 's forces used the Peritheorion 's ruined old fortifications as a first line of defence , with the city walls behind them . 
 After the foremost Turkish troops crossed the fortifications and dealt with the Bulgarian defenders , they began plundering the vicinity . However , to the surprise of Kantakouzenos and Umur Bey , the majority of Momchil 's men were standing in front of the city walls and had not yet participated in the skirmishes . As the Byzantine – Turkish force advanced towards the defenders , Momchil led his troops ahead into battle . His cavalry was promptly eliminated by Turkish sharpshooters and his remaining troops were surrounded on three sides by heavily armed horsemen . Momchil 's remaining men continued the fight on foot and for the most part did not surrender until Momchil himself perished . 
 Out of respect for Momchil , Kantakouzenos spared his wife , a Bulgarian woman he had captured during his conquest of Xanthi . He allowed her to flee to Bulgaria along with all of her property . However , it is unknown whether Momchil had any children from this marriage or a previous one , if any . Pavlov presents the hypothesis that Momchil 's wife was a noblewoman from the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo , whom he married as part of an agreement with the Bulgarian court . 
 = = In popular culture = = 
 In Bulgarian and South Slavic folklore in general , Momchil is glorified in numerous songs and epic tales as a brigand , defender of the people and a prominent fighter against the Turks . Indeed , some of the earliest heroic songs in Bulgarian folklore tradition deal with Momchil 's exploits . In some folklore material , Momchil , referred to as a duke , acts as the uncle of Prince Marko , another legendary figure who in epic poetry is a fighter against the Turks . In the folklore version of Momchil 's last battle , his wife , and not the citizens of Peritheorion , betrays him and is to blame for his death . On the other hand , Momchil 's legendary sister <unk> is described as the mother of Prince Marko as well as a major influence on him . 
 The town of <unk> and the village of <unk> in southern Bulgaria , as well as Momchil Peak on Greenwich Island of the South Shetland Islands in Antarctica are named after Momchil . His life served as the basis for an opera piece , eponymously named Momchil and written by Bulgarian composer Lyubomir <unk> . Momchil 's biography also inspired a 1988 children 's comic book , The Lord of Merope , which tells a largely fictionalised version of his story . 
 = Battle of the Dalmatian Channels = 
 The Battle of the Dalmatian Channels was a three @-@ day confrontation between three tactical groups of Yugoslav Navy ships and coastal artillery , and a detachment of naval commandos of the Croatian Navy fought on 14 – 16 November 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence . On 14 November , the commandos torpedoed a Mirna @-@ class patrol boat PČ @-@ 176 Mukos close to the island of Brač in the Split Channel of the Adriatic Sea , prompting a Yugoslav naval bombardment of Brač and Šolta Island the same day . The drifting Mukos was salvaged by Croatian civilian boats and was beached at Nečujam bay . 
 The next day , a group of Yugoslav Navy vessels deployed to the Split Channel , organised into the Kaštela tactical group ( TG ) and bombarded the city of Split in retaliation for the loss of Mukos . In return , Croatian coastal artillery engaged the Kaštela TG . To draw off some of the artillery fire , the Yugoslav Navy deployed another group of vessels from the island of Vis , organised as the Vis TG , south of Šolta where the TG was engaged by more Croatian artillery . The Kaštela TG retreated east and joined with the Ploče TG consisting of three minesweepers . 
 On 16 November , the combined Yugoslav force sailed through the Korčula Channel — a strait separating the islands of Hvar and Korčula — to reach safety at the Yugoslav Navy base at Vis . The warships were then engaged by Croatian coastal artillery deployed on Korčula and the Pelješac Peninsula , losing two minesweepers to the artillery fire in the process . 
 The battle marked the last deployment of the Yugoslav Navy into one of the Dalmatian channels , the loosening of the naval blockade of the Croatian coast imposed in September and the largest Croatian Navy operation in the war . The Croatian Navy later towed the grounded Mukos to Šibenik , repaired the vessel and put her into service as OB @-@ 62 Šolta . During the battle , 22 Yugoslav Navy crewmen , two Croatian gunners and two civilian sailors in Split were killed . Thirty @-@ three Yugoslav officers were charged in relation to the naval bombardment by Croatian authorities . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1990 , following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia , ethnic tensions increased . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence Forces ' ( Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) weapons to minimize resistance . On 17 August , the tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin , and parts of Lika , Kordun , Banovina , and eastern Croatia . This was followed by two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia , supported by Montenegro and Serbia 's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo , to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency 's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991 . 
 After a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March , the JNA , supported by Serbia and its allies , asked the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authorities and to declare a state of emergency . The request was denied on 15 March and the JNA came under the control of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević . Preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia , Milošević publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the Federal Presidency . By the end of March , the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence . The JNA intervened ; they increasingly supported the Croatian Serb insurgents and prevented Croatian police from intervening . In early April , the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control , known as SAO Krajina , with Serbia . The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt to secede . 
 In May 1991 , the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) , but its development was hampered by a United Nations ( UN ) arms embargo and the Yugoslav Navy 's blockade of the Adriatic coast , both of which were introduced in September . Following the Battle of the Barracks , the ZNG acquired a significant stock of weapons and ammunition , including 34 Yugoslav Navy vessels moored in Šibenik . Croatian forces using naval mines deployed in Kaštela Bay rendered the Yugoslav Navy base at Lora in Split inaccessible . On 8 October , Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia , and a month later the Croatian National Guard was renamed the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) . Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war ; the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik and the Battle of Vukovar . 
 During the first days of November , the Yugoslav Navy stopped the Libertas convoy twice for inspection between the islands of Brač and Korčula as it enforced the blockade . The convoy of 40 small boats led by the ferry Slavija was on its way to resupply Dubrovnik and retrieve refugees from the besieged city . On 11 November , the Maltese @-@ flagged coaster <unk> , manned by a Croatian crew , was sunk by gunfire off Šolta Island . 
 = = Order of battle = = 
 Despite the capture of the Yugoslav Navy vessels in September , Croatia 's coastal defences relied on captured coastal artillery on the mainland and the nearby islands . In central Dalmatia , these included three batteries on the mainland between Šibenik and Split , 90 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns on Žirje Island , a 100 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) battery near Zečevo and 88 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns on Smokvica Island near <unk> . Four coastal artillery batteries on islands off Split — the 88 @-@ millimetre <unk> Rat on the island of Šolta , the 85 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 3 in ) <unk> battery on the island of Brač , and the 88 @-@ millimetre battery <unk> and the 85 @-@ millimetre battery <unk> on the island of Korčula — were captured . Some the guns captured on Žirje and Šolta were removed and used to set up additional coastal artillery batteries at <unk> and <unk> in Split . Additional batteries were set up in Lovište at the tip of the Pelješac Peninsula , and in Blace and Črna Luka on Korčula on the coast north of Smokvica and Vela Luka . The battery deployed to Črna Luka contained 76 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) <unk> ( ZiS @-@ 3 ) guns . A naval commando detachment from the Croatian Navy was deployed to the western Brač . The coastal artillery was subordinated to the Croatian Navy and commanded by Admiral Sveto Letica . 
 The Yugoslav Navy deployed three tactical groups ( <unk> ) named Kaštela , Vis and Ploče off the coast of central Dalmatia from its bases on the islands of Vis and Lastovo . The Kaštela TG was deployed to the sea off Split and north of the islands of Šolta and Brač . It consisted of Koni @-@ class frigate VPBR @-@ 31 Split , Končar @-@ class fast attack craft RTOP @-@ 401 Rade Končar and RTOP @-@ 403 Ramiz <unk> , Osa @-@ class missile boat RČ @-@ 306 Nikola Martinović , Shershen @-@ class torpedo boats TČ @-@ 220 Crvena zvezda and TČ @-@ 224 Pionir II and two Mirna @-@ class patrol boats , including PČ @-@ 176 Mukos . Kaštela TG may have also included an additional Osa @-@ class missile boat . The Ploče TG , deployed to the sea between the mainland and Brač to the east of the Kaštela TG , consisted of three minesweepers : ML @-@ 143 Iž , ML @-@ 144 Olib and ML @-@ 153 <unk> . The Vis TG was deployed off the western tip of the island of Hvar . It consisted of a Kotor @-@ class frigate VPBR @-@ 34 Pula commanded by Captain Ilija Brčić , one Končar @-@ class fast attack craft , two Osa @-@ missile boats and two Mirna @-@ class patrol craft . The Yugoslav Navy fleet was under overall command of Rear Admiral Nikola <unk> .

 On 14 November at 5 : 34 p.m. , the Croatian naval commandos attacked Mukos off Brač using a torpedo fired from the island . Her crew reported an explosion in the bow of the ship and requested assistance from the Kaštela TG because she started to sink . The Kaštela TG dispatched Pionir II , which reached Mukos shortly afterwards and had transferred the crew of the damaged vessel by 6 : 10 p.m. Mukos was left to drift towards Šolta with her bow fully submerged and containing the bodies of three dead crew members . For nearly the entire night , the Kaštela TG directed gunfire against the <unk> and <unk> areas of Šolta to draw fire from Croatian coastal artillery . However , the coastal artillery deployed in the targeted areas did not return fire . Additional Yugoslav vessels sortied from Vis but returned to their base before the morning without transiting the Split Entrance — the strait between the islands of Brač and Šolta . By that time , the naval gunfire also died down . The Ploče TG remained in their assigned area of patrol . 
 = = = 15 November = = = 
 On 15 November at 6 : 42 a.m. , the Kaštela TG commenced a naval bombardment of targets in Split and on the islands of Brač and Šolta . The order was issued aboard VPBR @-@ 31 Split and the JNA Maritime Military Sector command and JNA bases in Split were advised of the attack . The JNA based in Split did not join the bombardment . Letica notified the JNA Maritime Military Sector commanding officer Major General Nikola Mladenić of the attack , but Mladenić said he could not control the situation because his headquarters was denied a supply of electricity . The European Community Monitor Mission ( ECMM ) was also notified ; they promised to make efforts to stop the bombardment . Shortly after , Letica ordered the coastal artillery to commence fire against the Kaštela TG . Besides several near @-@ misses , the coastal artillery fire scored a direct hit against VPBR @-@ 31 Split , that was attributed to the <unk> Rat @-@ based battery on Šolta . Croatian sources said Mladenić ordered the bombardment in retribution for the loss of Mukos . 
 In response to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of Šolta and Brač , the Vis TG led by Pula sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Kaštela TG . As the ships approached the Split Entrance , they made a radar contact sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed . Pula , attempting to enforce the blockade imposed in September , requested the vessel by radio to stop for an inspection . The vessel failed to respond and Pula fired several shots in front of it before Brčić noticed that it was a hydrofoil carrying an ECMM team and flying the flag of Europe . He abandoned the pursuit and proceeded to Šolta . 
 The Vis TG came under fire from the coastal artillery when it arrived within 7 to 8 nautical miles ( 13 to 15 kilometres ; 8 @.@ 1 to 9 @.@ 2 miles ) of Šolta . In response to the incoming fire , Pula fired her 76 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) bow @-@ mounted gun against targets on Brač and Šolta . Croatian sources said that approximately 800 rounds were fired indiscriminately , striking civilian targets , while Brčić said the TG under his command acted only against artillery located outside residential areas . Pula also fired four salvos of depth charges using her RBU @-@ 6000 rocket launcher while the land was outside its range to draw greater attention from the artillery gunners . 
 The Kaštela TG started to withdraw east at approximately 8 : 00 a.m. , fearing the shortest available route to Vis might be mined in the area of Split Entrance . It reached the eastern tip of Brač by 8 : 30 a.m. At 9 : 28 a.m. , three Yugoslav Air Force J @-@ 21 <unk> flew low over Brač and Šolta ; minutes later , two were reportedly shot down by anti @-@ aircraft artillery . Six Yugoslav jets were sortied against targets on Brač and Šolta . Following the naval action that morning , Croatian civilian boats from Šolta towed the partially submerged Mukos to Nečujam Bay and ran it aground there . In the afternoon , the Kaštela TG and the Ploče TG linked up east of the island of Hvar . 
 = = = 16 November = = = 
 On 16 November at 11 : 00 a.m. , the Kaštela and Ploče <unk> started to assemble at the eastern end of the Korčula Channel , which separates the islands of Hvar and Korčula just north of Cape Lovište at the westernmost tip of the Pelješac Peninsula . The relatively slow minesweepers Iž and Olib , which belonged to the Ploče TG , were hit in the bow and the engine room respectively , by the 76 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns at Lovište . To assist the minesweepers , Split turned around to engage the artillery at Cape Lovište while the minesweepers sailed north closer to the Hvar shore in increasingly thick fog . 
 At 3 : 30 p.m. , the Kaštela TG turned around once more to attack Cape Lovište , but were engaged by nearby coastal artillery located on Korčula . <unk> was damaged in the shooting and the entire naval force moved north @-@ west towards <unk> Island . Iž sustained heavy damage and ran aground in <unk> Bay off Hvar , and was abandoned . Olib sank between Pelješac and Hvar . Her crew was rescued by the remaining vessels in the group . At 7 : 00 p.m. , the fleet sailed south from <unk> towards the western part of Korčula , seeking shelter as the Sirocco wind strengthened . As the ships approached Korčula , they were fired upon by coastal artillery at Črna Luka and Cape <unk> , forcing them to turn west towards Vis . The Vis TG did not engage Croatian positions on 16 November . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Yugoslav Navy was defeated and its ships did not sail north of the Split Entrance again . The battle was the largest engagement of the Croatian Navy during the war . Two Croatian anti @-@ aircraft gunners were killed in action on the island of Brač . According to Mladenić , the Yugoslav Navy lost 22 seamen — including three aboard Mukos — two minesweepers and a patrol craft . The Yugoslav Air Force lost two aircraft but the pilots were rescued by a helicopter that sortied from Vis and picked them up from the sea . Croatian Navy divers later raised Mukos and she was towed to Šibenik by a <unk> @-@ owned tug . She was repaired and turned over to the Croatian Navy as OB @-@ 62 Šolta . Two civilians were killed and nine were wounded in the naval bombardment of Split . The bombardment damaged the Archaeological Museum , Split Municipality Building , Arena <unk> , Public Sanitation Institute , the Technical School , and the ferries Bartol Kašić and Vladimir <unk> , which were moored in the Port of Split . The two civilian fatalities were crew members of Vladimir <unk> . 
 Croatian authorities charged 33 JNA officers — including Brčić who was tried in absentia and convicted to 15 years in prison — for the bombardment of Split , Šolta and Brač . Brčić , who later became a high @-@ ranking officer of the Montenegrin Navy , was arrested in Naples in late 2007 when he travelled to a NATO function . He was not extradited to Croatia . Most of the other charged officers were also tried in absentia . As of 2013 , fifteen officers — including Brčić — were convicted , one was acquitted and seventeen cases were ordered by the Supreme Court of Croatia to be retried because of irregularities during previous trials . 
 In Croatia , the events of 14 and 15 November 1991 are referred to as the Battle of Split ( Bitka za Split ) or the Battle of the Split Channel ( <unk> u <unk> <unk> ) , while the events of 16 November are referred to as the Battle of the Korčula Channel ( Bitka u <unk> <unk> ) . The events spanning all three days of the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels are also referred to as the Battle of the Adriatic ( Bitka za <unk> ) . 
 = Hurricane Paula ( 2010 ) = 
 Hurricane Paula was a small hurricane that struck Honduras and Cuba in October 2010 . The eighteenth tropical cyclone , sixteenth named storm , and ninth hurricane of the season , Paula developed from a low pressure area over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 11 . Moving northwestward , it slowly organized and was upgraded to a tropical storm shortly thereafter . Around midday on October 11 , Paula made landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios at the border of Honduras and Nicaragua . In northeastern Honduras , strong winds destroyed several homes , while rainfall destroyed a few roads and dozens of buildings , include a school and a police station . Favorable conditions such as low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures allowed Paula to reach hurricane status early on October 12 . Further intensification occurred , and the storm peaked with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) while curving northward on October 13 . 
 Due to Paula 's small size , impact in Mexico was minor , mainly limited to light rainfall and winds . However , an American tourist drowned offshore Cozumel . After Paula attained its peak intensity on October 13 , wind shear began to increase , causing the storm to weaken . The storm turned north @-@ northeastward and fell to tropical storm intensity on October 14 . Shortly thereafter , Paula made landfall in the Cuban province of Pinar del Río . Early on October 15 , Paula weakened to a tropical depression while moving eastward over Cuba , before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area about six hours later . In Cuba , rainfall was mostly beneficial . Strong winds , with gusts reaching 68 mph ( 109 km / h ) , left power outages in Pinar del Río and <unk> provinces . In the Havana area , a few homes were deroofed , while falling trees blocked many roads . Impact in the Florida Keys was minimal , limited to light rainfall and increased tides .

 Tropical Storm Nicole exited the Caribbean Sea and dissipated on September 29 , leaving behind a broad area of cyclonic circulation at the lower levels of the atmosphere . A southeasterly @-@ moving cold front drifted from the Gulf of Mexico on October 5 , and developed into a stationary north @-@ south trough axis the following day . When a tropical wave that was associated with the previous development of Hurricane Otto traced into the Caribbean on October 7 , there was an escalation in the convection associated with the system . Another tropical wave traveled from the Lesser Antilles to the western Caribbean between October 9 and 10 . A large low @-@ pressure area formed as the wave interacted with the trough ; however , convection decreased on October 10 . 
 After convection increased again , the eighteenth tropical depression of the season developed at 0000 UTC on October 11 , while situated about 120 miles ( 190 km ) southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios , which is on the Honduras @-@ Nicaragua border . About six hours later , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Paula . Steered northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge , the storm made landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) at 1200 UTC . Shortly thereafter , the storm began to significantly intensify , due to sea surface temperatures of 84 @.@ 2 ° F ( 29 @.@ 0 ° C ) , as well as light to moderate wind shear . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories until late on October 11 , after satellite imagery , surface observations , and reconnaissance aircraft flight data confirmed the existence of a tropical cyclone ; by this time , Paula was already a strong tropical storm . 
 At 0000 UTC on October 12 , Paula strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Satellite imagery during the afternoon of October 12 indicated that Paul was a small hurricane , consisting of a round area of deep convection , with an eye feature developing . However , at 1800 UTC on October 12 , the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane while curving northward . Simultaneously , Paula attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 981 mbar ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) . After peak intensity late on October 12 , strong upper @-@ level west @-@ southwesterly winds interacted with the system . Hurricane @-@ force winds extended only 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the center of Paula , while tropical storm @-@ force winds extended 70 miles ( 110 km ) from the same point . Paula moved north @-@ northwest as the storm was impacted by a middle @-@ latitude trough over the Gulf of Mexico . 
 Increasing wind shear caused Paula to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane late on October 13 . Satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircraft flights indicated that cloud pattern was disrupted and the mid- and low @-@ level centers were becoming detached . Shortly thereafter , the National Hurricane Center remarked about the size of Paula , stating that , " a hurricane is crossing between the western tip of Cuba and eastern Yucatan ... but without modern technology no one would know it was there " . Drifting north @-@ northeastward ahead of a mid @-@ latitude trough , Paula weakened to a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on October 14 . Three hours later , the storm made landfall between Santa Lucía and Puerto Esperanza , in the Pinar del Río Province of Cuba , with winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . By 0600 UTC on October 15 , Paula weakened to a tropical depression , while moving eastward over Cuba . Six hours later , the storm degenerated into a remnant low pressure area , before completely dissipating early on October 16 .

 When the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Paula at 2100 UTC on October 11 , a tropical storm warning was issued from Limón eastward to the Honduras @-@ Nicaragua . The tropical storm warning was discontinued at 1200 UTC on the following day . The Comisión Permanente de <unk> ( <unk> ) issued a red alert for Bay Islands late on October 11 . Additionally , a yellow alert was issued for five departments , including Atlántida , Colón , Cortés , Olancho , and Yoro . A state of emergency was also declared for the Bay Islands Department on October 12 and was to remain in place for 48 hours . 
 Along the northeastern coast of Honduras , several homes were destroyed by the storm . Dangerous conditions produced by Paula also forced officials to evacuate low @-@ lying areas and shut down schools . Gale @-@ force winds onshore resulted in the closure of the Puerto Lempira Airport . Throughout coastal districts , rainfall from the storm ranged from 5 @.@ 9 to 7 @.@ 9 in ( 150 to 200 mm ) , resulting in widespread flooding . Winds from the storm were also estimated up to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) , and locals in La Mosquitia stated that the winds were stronger than those produced by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . In Puerto Lempira , four homes and two roads were destroyed by high winds and flooding . In the city , a total of 3 @.@ 31 in ( 84 mm ) of rain fell during Paula 's passage on October 11 . More than a dozen structures in <unk> , including a school and police station were also damaged by flood waters . Along the coast , waves up to 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) pounded beaches . 
 In Nicaragua , the storm produced heavy rainfall in some areas , though otherwise , impact is unknown .

 In Mexico , a tropical storm warning was issued from Chetumal to Punta Gruesa at 2100 UTC on October 11 . Simultaneously , a hurricane warning was posted from Punta Gruesa to Cancún , including Cozumel . Early on October 12 , another tropical storm warning was issued from Cabo Catoche to San Felipe . Around that time , the hurricane warning was modified to include Punta Gruesa to Cabo Catoche . Later on October 12 , the tropical storm warning Chetumal to Punta Gruesa was discontinued , as was the hurricane warning from Punta Gruesa to Punta Allen early on the following day . At 1500 UTC on October 13 , the tropical storm warning was revised to include Cancún to San Felipe . Simultaneously , the hurricane warning from Punta Allen to Cabo Catoche was canceled . Late on October 13 , the tropical storm warning from Cancún to San Felipe . Officials assured tourists their safety and did not issue evacuations ; however , about 1 @,@ 560 locals were evacuated from Isla Holbox and Isla <unk> . Roughly 28 @,@ 800 people were estimated to be visiting the region , most of whom were in Cancún . Between October 12 and 13 , transportation officials canceled 22 international flights to and from Cancún . 
 Off the coast of Cozumel , an American citizen drowned after being overcome by rough seas produced by the storm . Only light to moderate rain fell along the northeastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula ; throughout October 13 , 0 @.@ 91 in ( 23 mm ) of rain had fallen in Cancún and winds gusted up to 27 mph ( 43 km / h ) . Despite the storm 's close passage to the Yucatán Peninsula , Paula 's small size resulted in very little impact on land . According to Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto , the storm left no structural or vegetative damage . Following the hurricane 's passage , the red alerts issued for four Mexican states were discontinued and ports were re @-@ opened . 
 In Belize , a tropical storm watch was issued for the entire country at 0000 UTC on October 12 . It was discontinued about nine hours later . The Government of Belize suspended school classes , as the buildings were being used as storm shelters . Voluntary evacuations were recommended for residents of the coastal cayes . A small craft warning was declared along the coast and advised marines to take precautions . At Punta Negra , the National Guard of Belize evacuated residents on October 13 . However , no impact was reported in Belize .

 In Cuba , a hurricane warning was issued for Pinar del Río Province – the westernmost province – at 2100 UTC on October 12 . After Paula weakened to a tropical storm on October 14 , the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning . Early on October 15 , the tropical storm warning was discontinued . Officials recommended that those residing in low @-@ lying to evacuate for higher ground . The tobacco plants in Pinar del Rio , which are used to make Cuban cigars , were protected . 
 In Cuba , the outer bands of Paula brought heavy localized rains , especially to the Isla de la Juventud where 2 @.@ 8 in ( 71 mm ) of precipitation was recorded on October 12 . Heavy rain fell across much of Pinar del Río Province . In Cape San Antonio , 4 @.@ 85 in ( 123 mm ) of rain fell by the morning of October 14 . In some areas of western Cuba , the heavy precipitation was beneficial to reservoirs , grain crops , tubers and vegetables . The highest winds recorded during the storm 's passage were measured in Puerto Esperanza at 68 mph ( 109 km / h ) . Strong winds left power outages in <unk> , La Palma , Bahía Honda , and San Cristóbal . Near Havana , a few homes lost their roofs and power was lost to many homes , mostly as a result of a precautionary power shutdown . High winds also downed numerous trees , blocking many roads . Along the coast , rough seas damaged parts of the capital city 's seawall . Some streets near the shore were left under 1 to 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 to 0 @.@ 61 m ) of water at the height of the storm . By the afternoon of October 15 , emergency crews began clearing debris left behind by the storm . A small portion of banana crops in the Havana area suffered losses . Throughout the country , Paula resulted in relatively little damage . 
 In Florida , a tropical storm watch was issued from Dry Tortugas to Craig Key at 1500 UTC on October 13 . The tropical storm watch was discontinued early on October 15 . In the Florida Keys , the outer bands of Paula brought moderate rainfall and increased surf . A total of 1 @.@ 51 in ( 38 mm ) of rain in Key West had fallen between October 13 and 15 .

 = Para @-@ alpine skiing = 
 Paralympic alpine skiing is an adaptation of alpine skiing for athletes with a disability . The sport evolved from the efforts of disabled veterans in Germany and Austria during and after the Second World War . The sport is governed by the International Paralympic Committee Sports Committee . The primary equipment used includes outrigger skis , sit @-@ skis , and mono @-@ skis . Para @-@ alpine skiing disciplines include the Downhill , Super @-@ G , Giant Slalom , Slalom , Super Combined and Snowboard . 
 Para @-@ alpine skiing classification is the classification system for para @-@ alpine skiing designed to insure fair competition between alpine skiers with different types of disabilities . The classifications are grouped into three general disability types : standing , blind and sitting . A factoring system was created for para @-@ alpine skiing to allow the three classification groupings to fairly compete against each other in the same race despite different functional skiing levels and medical problems . 
 Alpine skiing was one of the foundation sports at the first Winter Paralympics in 1976 with Slalom and Giant Slalom events being held . Different disciplines were added to the Paralympic programme over time . The 2010 Winter Paralympics para @-@ alpine skiing events were held at Whistler Creekside . The disciplines at Whistler included Downhill , Super @-@ Combined , Super @-@ G , Slalom and Giant Slalom . 
 = = History = = 
 Skiing as a sport for people with disabilities traces its origins back to the Second World War , which produced large numbers of wounded soldiers . In Germany , Franz Wendel , an amputee who had lost a leg , successfully attached a pair of crutches to short skis . Sepp " Peppi " <unk> , an Austrian veteran who had lost both his legs to a hand grenade , taught himself to ski and eventually became a ski instructor at Kitzbühel , founded a division of the Austrian Ski Association for handicapped skiers . By 1947 , annual races were being held in Austria . Ludwig Guttman , a key figure in the history of paralympic sport , helped organise ski events . In the United States , Gretchen Fraser began teaching skiing to amputees in army hospitals . By the 1960s , a number of organisations had been founded . For a long time , disability skiing was restricted to amputees , but in 1969 , blind skier Jean <unk> , a former ski instructor before he lost his eyesight , began a skiing program in Aspen , Colorado for blind skiers . The first international competition , the World Disabled Alpine Championships , was held in France in 1974 .

 International and national events for the sport include the Winter Paralympics , World Championships , World Cups , Continental Cups , National Championships , IPCAS Races and IPCAS Para @-@ Snowboard . Skiers from 39 different countries actively compete in para @-@ alpine skiing in a sport is that one of eight governed by the International Paralympic Committee Sports Committee , with rules for para @-@ alpine skiing set forth in the IPCAS Rules and Regulations . Event specific rules may be created for events like the Paralympic Games . One set of rules was created in 1994 and were specified in the IPC Handbook . This was used to govern IPC @-@ sanctioned events like the Paralympic Games for many years . Competition rules for classes use rules set by or modified from rules created by the International Ski Federation ( ISF ) . These rules were set at the 42nd International Ski Conference in 2000 . The two rule sets worked in concert with each other , with the ISF rules specifying the rules for alpine skiing , and the IPC providing modifications for para @-@ alpine skiing . The IPC Alpine Sports Assembly Executive Committee can determine if skiers are eligible to compete in IPC sanctioned events at their own discretion regardless of what the rules say . National Paralympic Committees can have their own rule sets at national competitions . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 = = = Sitting = = = 
 The primary equipment used in the sport includes outrigger skis , sit @-@ skis , and mono @-@ skis . Depending on the classification , other equipment may be used by skiers including guide skiers , cut @-@ down ski poles , orthopedic aids , or prostheses . For standing skiers , different class rules determine what sort of equipment is allowed in competition , such as one pole , two poles or no poles , or one or two skis . Rules for equipment use in competition are set by FIS and the IPC . 
 There are minimum lengths for skis used in competition , with men 's skis needing to be at least 165 centimetres ( 65 in ) long and women 's skis needing to be at least 155 centimetres ( 61 in ) long . <unk> used for skis have a maximum height of 55 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) . 
 Sit @-@ skis are designed for wheelchair users or other skiers with a form of paraplegia . The first sit @-@ ski was built in 1967 by Josef <unk> from the Bavaria region of Germany . Early sit @-@ skis used in para @-@ alpine skiing had two wide skis , brakes , and were custom built to fit the specific skier . The weight of the ski prevented skiers from skiing moguls or steep slopes . Sit @-@ ski development continued into the 1980s , with a more modern version demonstrated in Engelberg , Switzerland in 1987 at a workshop hosted by the Swiss Association of <unk> . As the technology advanced , a chair was developed that could be attached to the skis which were used by able bodied skiers . They are now made from fibreglass and polyester , and the weight has been dramatically reduced , allowing skiers to ski on steeper slopes and compete in the moguls . Current sit @-@ skis include seat @-@ belts . As skis for able @-@ bodied skiers have evolved to specialise for the event , the skis that sit @-@ skiers use have also changed . 
 Sit @-@ skiers use a specially designed ski called a mono @-@ ski , sometimes called a maxi mono @-@ ski . It is used by skiers with lower limb disabilities including paralysis . A variation of the mono @-@ ski exists for skiers with bilateral , above the knee amputations . The mono @-@ ski was developed in Austria in the early 1980s by bilateral above @-@ the @-@ knee amputee Josef <unk> and engineer Horst <unk> . The fundamental design they created is still the one used for mono @-@ skis currently used in competition . The mono @-@ ski was quickly used by German skiers who built their own at a workshop in Tübingen . The mono @-@ ski uses the same skis used for able @-@ bodied alpine skiing , adapted so that the skier sits on a chair attached to the ski via a spring . The mono @-@ ski was first used at the 1988 Winter Paralympics . 
 A monoski , also known as a sit @-@ ski , consists of a molded seat mounted on a metal frame . A shock absorber beneath the seat eases riding on uneven terrain and helps in turning by maximizing ski @-@ snow contact . Modern monoskis interface with a single , ordinary alpine ski by means of a " ski foot , " a metal or plastic block in the shape of a boot sole that clicks into the ski 's binding . A <unk> uses outriggers for stability ; an outrigger resembles a forearm crutch with a short ski on the bottom . People new to mono @-@ skiing are often surprised to see how much terrain is skiable in a monoski ; advanced <unk> can be found not only carving turns on groomed runs but also skiing moguls , terrain parks , race courses , glades and even backcountry terrain — in short , wherever stand @-@ up skiers can go . 
 As alpine ski technology has advanced , so has monoski technology . In North America in the 1970s and early 1980s , early " sit @-@ skis " took the form of fiberglass sleds with metal runners . The first downhill sit @-@ ski in the US , the <unk> , was invented by American Peter Axelson in 1978 . Dragging very long poles or " slicks " in the snow were the method in which turns were actually made harder , although not effectively . Few users became proficient enough to descend even intermediate terrain without assistance from a " <unk> . " By the early ' 80s , Europeans were experimenting with " ski @-@ bobs " that mounted on two small skis . In place of today 's minimal bucket seats were large fiberglass or Kevlar shells , and leaf springs at first were used instead of slide absorbers . The three @-@ ski design proved accident prone , and it was soon abandoned for a single ski by most manufacturers . By the middle of the decade , the technology had migrated to Canada , and on both continents the modern monoski began to emerge . In the United States , Enabling Technologies ' Unique , Sunrise Medical 's Shadow , and Dan Fallon 's <unk> were some of the first commercially available monoskis . <unk> ( Austria ) , Tessier ( France ) , and <unk> ( USA ) are some of the major companies . 
 In 1984 , <unk> took part in the 1984 Innsbruck Paralympic Winter Games as a demonstration sport ; in Innsbruck 1988 , full medal categories were added for sitting skiers . 
 = = = Standing = = = 
 For standing competitors , outrigger skis can be used in some classifications . These are ski poles with small skis on the end . They assist a skier balancing as they ski down the slopes , and in moving uphill for short distances , enabling skiers to do things like a climb a slope to get on a chair lift . 
 = = = Other equipment = = = 
 Beyond this equipment , skiers also gear up wearing special boots , helmets , ski suits , and goggles . At the Paralympic Games , this equipment is prohibited from having advertisements on it . The boots attach to the ski at the heel and toe , and are designed to provide support to foot and ankle with the use of materials in boot construction like hard plastics . All helmets used in competition are required to be hard @-@ shell helmets . 
 For skiers with visual impairments , guides are used to assist the skier down the course . Guides are skiers who do not have a vision impairment who assist a skier down the slopes by telling the skier where to go using their voice or a radio . Skiers can use more than one guide in the course of a competition , but the guide is only eligible for a medal if they have competed with the same skier for the duration of the discipline event . Like the skier , the guide is required to have an IPCAS Licence in order to participate in a competition and adhere to anti @-@ doping rules . 
 = = Disciplines = = 
 Para @-@ alpine skiing disciplines include the Downhill , Super @-@ G , Giant Slalom , Slalom , Super Combined and Snowboard . The rules for these disciplines are based on the rules set by the International Ski Federation , though some rules have been adapted for skiers with disabilities . While skiing in these disciplines , skiers can reach speeds of 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) an hour . 
 = = = Downhill = = = 
 This is a speed based timed discipline , where competitors ski down a steep course that can finish 450 metres ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) to 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) lower than it started while containing many turns and jumps . The winner is determined based on one run down the course , with the competitor with the fastest time being the winner . Skiers navigate between gates in the Downhill , the fewest number gates amongst all para @-@ alpine disciplines , and if they miss a set , they are disqualified . In some competitions that require qualification for entry , a skier can qualify for this discipline through Downhill or Super @-@ G. There are Disabled FIS points available in sanctioned events . This race is included on the current Paralympic programme . 
 Skis for women must be at least 200 centimetres ( 79 in ) long with a tolerance of 1 centimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) . For men , the ski length must be at least 205 centimetres ( 81 in ) long with the same tolerance . Women and men 's skis need a minimum radius of 45 metres ( 148 ft ) . Skiers used curved ski poles for this event . Men and women both need their skis to have a profile radius of 67 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) . Top speeds in this event can be up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) an hour . Before the start of the event , the skier is required to do a practice run , and is required to wear a helmet during all their runs . 
 = = = Super @-@ G = = = 
 Developed in the 1980s , the Super @-@ G is less technical than others , and is known for the speed of the skier , who navigate a course that has a vertical drop between 400 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) to 600 metres ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) from top to bottom . Compared to other para @-@ alpine skiing disciplines , this course tends to be mid @-@ length . It is longer than the Giant Slalom and the Slalom but shorter than the Downhill course . In this discipline , competitors ski between alternating red and blue gates that are 25 metres ( 82 ft ) apart , with men needing to clear 35 gates and women needing to clear 30 gates . In some competitions that require qualification for entry , a skier can qualify for this discipline through Downhill , Slalom or Super @-@ G. There are Disabled FIS points available in sanctioned events . This race is included on the current Paralympic programme . 
 Skis for women must be at least 200 centimetres ( 79 in ) long with a tolerance of 1 centimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) . For men , the ski length must be at least 205 centimetres ( 81 in ) long with the same tolerance . Women and men 's skis need a minimum radius of 33 metres ( 108 ft ) . Men and women both need their skis to have a profile radius of 65 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) . Skiers used curved ski poles for this event . 
 = = = Giant Slalom = = = 
 With a vertical drop of 300 metres ( 980 ft ) to 400 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) , this is one of the more technical of the para @-@ alpine skiing disciplines . This discipline involves two runs down a course straighter and shorter than the Downhill , but longer and having fewer turns than the Slalom course . The winner is determined based on the combined time for both races . After the first run , the bottom 20 % of finishers can be eliminated from the competition at the discretion of the judges . The starting order for the second run is starts with the slowest of the top 15 skiers , with the fastest skier in the first run skiing 15th . Any skiers who finished outside the top 15 then ski in order based on their times from the first run . For example , the 18th fastest finisher in the first run skis 18th in the second run . In some competitions , this is modified using 30 skiers instead of 15 . The IPC / FIS run jointly sanctioned events for Slalom . This race is included on the current Paralympic programme . Skiers used straight ski poles for this event . 
 = = = Slalom = = = 
 The name for this event is from a Norwegian word meaning " sloping path . " This event is the most technical para @-@ alpine skiing disciplines , with a vertical drop of only 140 metres ( 460 ft ) to 220 metres ( 720 ft ) on an intentionally iced course . This is the shortest of all the para @-@ alpine skiing events and uses two different courses . Skiers go down each course once , with their finishing position being determined based on their combined course completion time . There are gates in this event , about 55 @-@ 75 for men and 40 @-@ 60 for women , and if a skier misses a gate , they are disqualified from the race . After the first run , the bottom 20 % of finishers can be eliminated from the competition at the discretion of the judges . The starting order for the second run is starts with the slowest of the top 15 skiers , with the fastest skier in the first run skiing 15th . Any skiers who finished outside the top 15 then ski in order based on their times from the first run . For example , the 18th fastest finisher in the first run skis 18th in the second run . Skiers used straight ski poles for this event . In some competitions that require qualification for entry , a skier can qualify for this discipline through Downhill , Slalom or Super @-@ G. The IPC / FIS run jointly sanctioned events for Slalom . This race is included on the current Paralympic programme . Skiers often wear pads when competing in this discipline . 
 = = = Super Combined = = = 
 The Super Combined event is a combination of two disciplines such as the Slalom and the Super G , or the Downhill and the Slalom . In the event , skiers go down the Downhill course once , and the Slalom course twice . The times for the races are combined , with the fastest time winning . 
 = = = Snowboard = = = 
 Snowboard has vertical drops between 100 metres ( 330 ft ) and 240 metres ( 790 ft ) for both men 's and women 's races with the course being run over a distance of 400 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) to 900 metres ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) . The course has alternating gates . The sport is only open to standing competitors . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Para @-@ alpine skiing classification is the classification system for para @-@ alpine skiing designed to insure fair competition between alpine skiers with different types of disabilities . The classifications are grouped into three general disability types : standing , blind and sitting . Classification governance is handled by International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing . Skiers are classified based on medical assessment , and their body position when they ski . Blind skiers are evaluated purely on a medical assessment . Prior to that , several sport governing bodies dealt with classification including the International Sports Organization for the Disabled ( ISOD ) , International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation ( ISMWSF ) , International Blind Sports Federation ( IBSA ) and Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association ( CP @-@ ISRA ) . Some classification systems are governed by bodies other than International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing for systems not used in international competition . The sport is open to all competitors with a visual or physical disability . It is not open to people with intellectual disabilities . 
 The first classification systems for para @-@ alpine skiing were developed in Scandinavia , with early systems designed for skiers with amputations . At the time , equipment had yet to be developed to allow participation for skiers with spinal cord injuries . The goal of the early classification systems was to be functional but ended up being medical classification systems . At the first Winter Paralympics in 1976 , there were two classifications for the sport . By the 1980s , classification existed for skiers with cerebral palsy . At that time , with inspiration from wheelchair basketball classification , efforts were made to make classification more of a functional system . Ten classes existed by the 1980s , and since then , efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of classification by reducing the number of classes so fewer medals can be rewarded . 
 = = Factor system = = 
 A factoring system was created for para @-@ alpine skiing to allow the grouping of classifications into three general groups : sitting , standing and visually impaired . One medal event can then be held for each group even though there is a wide range of functional mobility and medical differences . The factoring system works by having a number for each class based on their functional mobility or vision levels , where the results are calculated by multiplying the finish time by the factored number . The resulting number is the one used to determine the winner in events where the factor system is used . This means the faster skier down a hill may not be the winner of an event . 
 The factoring system is used at several para @-@ alpine skiing competitions including the Alpine Cup , North American Races , European Cup , World Cup events , World Championships , and the Winter Paralympics . Disciplines use factored results to combine classes unless there are six or more skiers competing in a specific class . 
 = 1920 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1920 Atlantic hurricane season featured tropical storms and hurricanes only in the month of September . Although no " hurricane season " was defined at the time , the present @-@ day delineation of such is June 1 to November 30 . The first system , a hurricane , developed on September 7 while the last , a tropical depression , transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 27 . Of note , four of the six cyclones co @-@ existed with another tropical cyclone during the season . 
 Of the season 's six tropical cyclones , five became tropical storms and four strengthened into hurricanes . Furthermore , none of these strengthened into a major hurricane — Category 3 or higher on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale — marking the seventh such occurrence since 1900 . The strongest hurricane of the season peaked as only as a strong Category 2 with winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . The second hurricane caused one death and $ 1 @.@ 45 million ( 1920 USD ) in damage in Louisiana , the third left one fatality in North Carolina , and the fifth storm indirectly killed one person in Florida . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 30 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm strength . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Hurricane One = = = 
 The first known storm of the season was initially identified on September 7 as a 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) tropical storm over Atlantic Ocean . Traveling towards the northwest , the storm gradually intensified , attaining hurricane @-@ status late on September 9 . The following day , a ship in the vicinity of the storm recorded a pressure of 985 mbar ( hPa ) , the lowest pressure recorded in relation to the storm . Around 1200 UTC , the hurricane turned towards the north and intensified into a modern @-@ day Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale early on September 11 . The storm continued to intensify through September 12 when it reached its peak intensity with winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . After maintaining this intensity for 18 hours , the hurricane began to weaken as it turned towards the northwest . By 0000 UTC on September 14 , the storm weakened to a Category 1 hurricane . The system began to undergo an extratropical transition , completing the process early the next day . The system tracked nearly due east before dissipating on September 16 to the north of the Azores islands . 
 = = = Hurricane Two = = = 
 An area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical depression northwest of Colombia on September 16 . The system remained a weak tropical depression as it made landfall on Nicaragua , but later intensified to tropical storm strength as it moved across the Gulf of Honduras , prior to making a second landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula . Once in the Gulf of Mexico , the storm quickly intensified as it moved towards the north @-@ northwest , reaching its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) prior to making landfall near Houma , Louisiana with no change in intensity . Afterwards , it quickly weakened over land , before dissipating on September 23 over eastern Kansas . 
 As it approached the United States Gulf Coast , the hurricane forced an estimated 4 @,@ 500 people to evacuate off of Galveston Island , and numerous other evacuations and precautionary measures to occur . At landfall , the hurricane generated strong winds along a wide swath of the coast , uprooting trees and causing damage to homes and other infrastructure . Heavy rainfall associated with the storm peaked at 11 @.@ 9 in ( 300 mm ) in Robertsdale , Alabama . The heavy rains also washed out railroads , leading to several rail accidents . Across the Gulf Coast , one death was associated with the hurricane and damage from the storm totaled to $ 1 @.@ 45 million ( 1920 USD ) . 
 = = = Hurricane Three = = = 
 A low pressure area developed into a tropical depression on September 19 , while located about 245 mi ( 395 km ) southeast of <unk> , South Carolina . The system , which had an " extremely small diameter " , moved in a slow cyclonic loop . Around 1200 UTC on September 20 , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm . By midday on September 22 , it continued the cyclonic loop while moving northwestward . The storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane around that time . Maximum sustained winds peaked at 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) late on September 22 . However , the hurricane then began to weakened and fell to a strong tropical storm early the following day , at which time it made landfall near Cape Fear , North Carolina . The cyclone quickly weakened after moving inland and dissipated over western Virginia early on September 24 . 
 Offshore Bald Head Island , North Carolina , a lightship was carried several miles from its original location and observed winds of 72 mph ( 116 km / h ) . Inland , a house in Wilmington was blown off its foundation and destroyed in , potentially a small tornado spawned by the cyclone . Many small severe windstorms were reported in Pitt County , where one person was killed , a number of people were injured , and several buildings were demolished . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Four = = = 
 A tropical depression developed from a weak low pressure area along a decaying stationary front about 450 mi ( 720 km ) east of Bermuda around 1200 UTC on September 23 . Based on ship observations , the system is estimated to have become a tropical storm early on September 24 . The drifted slowly eastward for a few days and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) later that day . Eventually , the system curved east @-@ southeastward , but later continued its generally eastward motion at a faster forward speed . Around 1200 UTC on September 27 , the storm weakened to a tropical depression , hours before being absorbed by a cold front . This storm was not operationally tracked in real time , but was later added to HURDAT based on weather maps and ship reports . 
 = = = Hurricane Five = = = 
 A low pressure area centered the Gulf of Mexico on September 25 and was designated as a tropical depression hours later . Turning west @-@ southwestward , the storm gradually intensified , attaining tropical storm @-@ status on September 27 . The next day , the system nearly stalled close to the center of the Gulf of Mexico . On September 28 , further development of the storm took place and ships in the vicinity of the storm reported a strong gale . The next day , the storm strengthened into a hurricane . Several hours later , nearby ship reported a pressure of 987 mbar ( 29 @.@ 1 inHg ) , the lowest pressure associated with the hurricane . Around this time , the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) ; the storm also began to turn northeastward at this time . The hurricane then accelerated and began weakening . Early on September 30 , the storm made landfall near Cedar Key , Florida , with winds up to 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone over Florida . Later that day , the remnants dissipated over the eastern Atlantic Ocean . 
 Although the storm weakened significantly before landfall , it caused severe damage along the immediate coastlines of western Florida . Low lands along the coast were inundated by storm surge and heavy rains , peaking at 8 in ( 203 @.@ 2 mm ) . Crop lands were flooded , causing substantial damage to the fruit industry . One person was killed after being electrocuted by a downed wire in St. Petersburg . Several ships were also destroyed by the storm while docked along the coast . 
 = = = Tropical Depression = = = 
 On October 20 , a westward moving tropical wave developed into a tropical depression about 165 mi ( 265 km ) north @-@ northeast of Barbuda . Trekking northwestward over the next three days , before curving northward in advance of an approaching frontal boundary . The depression peaked with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 010 mbar ( 30 inHg ) . By October 25 , it began merging with a cold front , finally being absorbed on October 27 about 590 mi ( 950 km ) east @-@ northeast of Bermuda . 
 = British Rail Class 47 = 
 The British Rail Class 47 is a class of British railway diesel @-@ electric locomotive that was developed in the 1960s by Brush Traction . A total of 512 Class 47s were built at Crewe Works and Brush 's Falcon Works , Loughborough between 1962 and 1968 , which made them the most numerous class of British mainline diesel locomotive . 
 They were fitted with the Sulzer <unk> twin @-@ bank twelve @-@ cylinder unit producing 2 @,@ 750 bhp ( 2 @,@ 050 kW ) - though this was later derated to 2 @,@ 580 bhp ( 1 @,@ 920 kW ) to improve reliability - and have been used on both passenger and freight trains on Britain 's railways for over 50 years . Despite the introduction of more modern types of traction , a significant number are still in use , both on the mainline and on heritage railways . As of July 2015 , 82 locomotives still exist as Class 47s , with further examples having been converted to other classes ; approximately 30 retain " operational status " on the mainline . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The Class 47 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the British Transport Commission ( BTC ) to completely remove steam locomotives from British Rail by a target date of 1968 . They therefore required a large build of lightweight Type 4 locomotives to achieve this aim . This required locomotives producing at least 2 @,@ 500 bhp ( 1 @,@ 900 kW ) but with an axle load of no more than 19 long tons ( 19 t ) . However , the BTC were not convinced that the future of diesel traction lay down the hydraulic transmission path of the Western Region , and began looking at various diesel @-@ electric designs . 
 Despite the construction of two demonstration locomotives ( <unk> LION , produced by AEI and BRC & W using a Sulzer engine , and <unk> <unk> , built by Brush Traction using Maybach engines ) , the need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount , and the pilot build of what would become Class 47 began before the prototypes could be comprehensively assessed . This initial build of 20 locomotives ( Nos. <unk> to <unk> ) were mechanically different from the remainder of the type , and would be withdrawn earlier . However , based on these and the success of LION , an order for 270 locomotives was made , which was later revised upwards a number of times to reach the final total of 512 . Five locomotives , Nos. <unk> to <unk> , were fitted with a Sulzer V12 <unk> power unit and classified as Class 48s ; the experiment was not deemed a success , and they were later converted to standard 47s . 
 = = In service = = 
 Eventually , 310 locomotives were constructed by Brush in Loughborough , and the remaining 202 at BR 's Crewe Works . The first 500 locomotives were numbered sequentially from <unk> to <unk> , with the remaining twelve being numbered from <unk> to <unk> . The locomotives went to work on passenger and freight duties on all regions of British Rail . Large numbers went to replace steam locomotives , especially on express passenger duties . 
 The locomotives , bar a batch of 81 built for freight duties , were all fitted with steam heating boilers for train heat duties . The initial batch of twenty , plus <unk> and <unk> , were also fitted with electric train heating ( ETH ) . With this type of heating becoming standard , a further large number of locomotives were later fitted with this equipment . 
 In the mid 1960s , it was decided to de @-@ rate the engine output of the fleet from 2 @,@ 750 bhp ( 2 @,@ 050 kW ) to 2 @,@ 580 bhp ( 1 @,@ 920 kW ) . This significantly improved reliability by reducing stresses on the power plant , whilst not causing a noticeable reduction in performance . 
 = = Sub @-@ Classes = = 
 In the early 1970s , the fleet was renumbered into the <unk> series to conform with the computerised TOPS systems . This enabled a number of easily recognisable sub @-@ classes to be created , depending on the differing equipment fitted . The original series were based on train heating capability and were as follows ; 
 Class 47 / 0 : Locomotives with steam heating equipment . 
 Class 47 / 3 : Locomotives with no train heating . 
 Class 47 / 4 : Locomotives with dual or electric train heating . 
 However , this numbering system was later disrupted as locomotives were fitted with extra equipment and were renumbered into other sub @-@ classes . For an overview of the renumbering see the Class 47 renumbering page . This section summarises the main sub @-@ classes that were created . 
 = = = Class 47 / 0 = = = 
 Originally numbered from <unk> to <unk> , these locomotives were the " basic " Class 47 with steam heating equipment fitted . In the 1970s and 1980s , with steam heating of trains gradually being phased out , all locomotives fitted with the equipment gradually had their steam heating boilers removed . Some were fitted with ETH and became 47 / 4s , whilst the others remained with no train heating capability and were therefore used mainly on freight work . In the 1990s , the class designation 47 / 2 was applied to some class 47 / 0s and class 47 / 3s after they were fitted with multiple working equipment . The locomotives involved also had their vacuum braking systems removed or isolated , leaving them air braked only . This was mainly a paper exercise , however , and the locomotives were not renumbered ; in this article they are included in Class 47 / 0 . 
 = = = Class 47 / 3 = = = 
 Originally numbered from <unk> to <unk> , this sub @-@ class was originally built with no train heating equipment and therefore remained as freight locomotives almost exclusively for their working lives . They were all fitted with slow speed control for working MGR coal trains ( as were a number of Class 47 / 0s ) . However , during the summer months when train heat was not required , 47 / 3s could regularly be found hauling the extra trains that the holiday season brought . The sub @-@ type remained stable until withdrawals started , although an " extra " 47 / 3 , <unk> , was created in 1992 when <unk> had its train heating equipment removed and was renumbered . This was a direct replacement for collision damaged <unk> . Also , <unk> was renumbered to <unk> in 1993 for use on RTC test trains . 
 = = = Class 47 / 4 = = = 
 The designation for standard locomotives fitted with ETH and therefore used for passenger , mail and parcels use . 133 locomotives had been fitted by the time renumbering occurred , and shortly afterwards the sub @-@ class had settled down to 154 locomotives , numbered <unk> @-@ <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> . Later , further class 47 / 0s were converted to class 47 / 4s and renumbered into the series from <unk> onwards , which eventually reached <unk> . 
 = = = Class 47 / 6 and Class 47 / 9 = = = 
 After being severely damaged in a derailment near Peterborough in 1974 , locomotive <unk> was selected to be a testbed for the projected Class 56 , and was fitted with a 16 @-@ cylinder Ruston <unk> engine rated at 3 @,@ 250 bhp ( 2 @,@ 420 kW ) for assessment purposes . To identify it as unique , it was renumbered <unk> ( at the time the number range for Class 47s only extended as far as <unk> ) . Later , in 1979 , it was used again for the Class 58 project , fitted with a 12 @-@ cylinder Ruston engine ( this time of 3 @,@ 300 bhp ( 2 @,@ 500 kW ) ) , and renumbered <unk> . It continued with this non @-@ standard engine fitted until its withdrawal in 1990 .

 In the late 1970s , BR authorities identified a need to replace the ageing trains operating the Glasgow to Edinburgh shuttle services , in order to increase speed and reliability . The trains were operated by pairs of Class 27s , one at each end of this train . It was decided to convert twelve 47 / 4s to operate the service in push @-@ pull mode . The locomotives would be known as Class 47 / 7 and would be fitted with TDM push @-@ pull equipment and long @-@ range fuel tanks , and be maintained to operate at 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . The conversions began in 1979 and the service was operated completely by them from 1980 . In 1985 , the push @-@ pull service spread to Glasgow @-@ Aberdeen services , and a further four locomotives were converted . The sub @-@ class therefore comprised Nos. <unk> to <unk> , though a further locomotive , <unk> , was converted in 1988 after the fire @-@ damaged <unk> was withdrawn . 
 = = = Class 47 / 7b and 47 / 7c = = = 
 In the 1990s , further 47 / 4s were converted with long @-@ range fuel tanks and equipment to allow them to work with a type of rolling stock known as propelling control vehicles @-@ PCV , which utilised <unk> ( Railway Clearing House ) cables to allow the PCV driver to signal to the driver on the locomotive to apply power and operate the brakes - neither these locomotives or the <unk> were equipped with TDM push @-@ pull equipment . They were also numbered into the 47 / 7 series , from <unk> onwards . With dwindling passenger work for them , a number of 47 / 8s , already fitted with the extra fuel tanks , were also renumbered into this series . 
 Two locomotives , <unk> Prince William and <unk> Prince Henry , were dedicated for use on the Royal Train , and were designated as Class 47 / 7c . 
 = = = Class 47 / 8 = = = 
 The last of the original 47 / 4 conversions , from <unk> to <unk> , were fitted with extra fuel tanks , giving them an extended range . Four earlier Class 47 / 4s were also converted . In 1989 it was decided to give these locomotives easy <unk> , and so these locomotives were renumbered into their own series from <unk> to <unk> . At the same time , further locomotives were fitted with extra fuel tanks and renumbered ; the series eventually reached <unk> . After the privatisation of British Rail , the locomotives in the 47 / 8 number range were mainly used by Virgin Trains on cross @-@ country work until the introduction of their Voyager trains . These duties have kept them maintained in serviceable condition , allowing them to remain operational longer than the majority of their classmates . As a consequence most of them received relatively recent overhauls . The locomotives in this number range are officially Class 47 / 4s under the TOPS system . 
 = = Decline = = 
 By 1986 , only five of the original 512 locomotives had been withdrawn from service , all because of serious accident damage . However , with work for the class declining due to the introduction of new rolling stock , and spare parts becoming difficult to source , some inroads started being made . 
 The first locomotives to be targeted were the non @-@ standard pilot batch of 20 , now numbered <unk> @-@ <unk> . Three locomotives were withdrawn as life @-@ expired in February 1986 , and the remainder of the batch that had not recently been overhauled followed in the next two years . All 20 were withdrawn by 1992 . 
 Meanwhile , BR drew up a ' hit @-@ list ' of locomotives for early withdrawal , mainly including those with non @-@ standard electrical equipment , known as series parallel locomotives . In the outset , withdrawals were slow , mainly due to the surplus of spare parts and new flows of freight traffic which required extra locomotives ; only 61 locomotives had been withdrawn by the end of 1992 . However , with the introduction of new locomotives , the rate of withdrawal quickly rose , with 86 more 47s reaching the end of their lives in the next three years . With most of the non @-@ standard locomotives withdrawn , the reduction of the fleet again proceeded more slowly . The privatisation of British Rail also produced new independent rail companies needing available traction until they could order new locomotives . From 1996 to 2006 , an average of around fifteen locomotives per year were taken out of service . 
 During the decline in passenger work a number of locomotives were painted in " celebrity " colours , depicting various liveries that the type had carried during its history . This continued a tradition of painting 47s in unusual liveries , which dates back to 1977 , when Stratford depot in East London painted two locomotives with huge Union Flags to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II .

 Riviera Trains is a company based at Crewe with a fleet of locomotives which are mainly used to haul charter trains , but have since been hired out for use with <unk> , maintained by <unk> . Locomotives currently operational are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Colas Rail owns a small fleet of locomotives for duties hauling its track maintenance trains and occasional steel traffic . Locomotives currently operational are <unk> and <unk> . 
 Freightliner Group , a freight company , operate <unk> ( <unk> ) , which was named Beeching 's Legacy on 12 November 2015 to mark 50 years since the first container train ran under British Rail . The ceremony was held at the National Railway Museum at York , with the Secretary of State for Transport , Patrick McLoughlin in attendance . 
 A number of other locomotives are stored in a serviceable condition by these operators , and both these and some preserved locomotives that are maintained to mainline standards ( such as " Royal Train " locomotive <unk> , along with <unk> and <unk> ) may appear on the network at any time . Approximately 20 further locomotives are owned by the companies above and others , and remain in non @-@ operational " stored " condition . 
 The stored ( out of use ) locos on 17 / 10 / 15 are <unk> , 236 , 270 , 355 , 368 , 488 , 492 , 500 , 501 , 526 , 701 , 703 , 714 , 715 , 744 , 749 , 761 , 768 , 769 , 772 , 776 , 787 , 810 , 811 , 813 , 816 , 841 and 853 .

 11 January 1965 : <unk> was severely damaged after the freight train it was hauling ran out of control near Shrewsbury , eventually demolishing a signal box . It was withdrawn two months later , becoming the first Class 47 withdrawn after a working life of only eight months . 
 17 December 1965 : <unk> <unk> was derailed near Bridgend whilst hauling a train of empty coaches . Shortly afterwards , a freight train collided heavily with the wreckage , killing the drivers of both locomotives . <unk> was withdrawn some four months later . Its nameplates were salvaged , and transferred to No . <unk> . 
 8 April 1969 : <unk> was badly damaged when , while hauling a freight train at <unk> Green , it was struck head @-@ on by a passenger train that had passed a signal at danger . <unk> caught fire after the accident and became the third Class 47 withdrawn . 
 13 March 1971 : <unk> was wrecked after its power unit , which had been experimentally uprated , exploded at <unk> Junction while the locomotive was hauling a Liverpool Street to Norwich express . 
 11 June 1972 : <unk> was involved in the Eltham Well Hall rail crash in which six people were killed . The locomotive was repaired , but much later in its life when numbered <unk> , it was withdrawn from the Class 57 rebuilding programme after damage was discovered which was thought to have dated back to the accident . 
 16 March 1976 : <unk> collided with a lorry that had fallen from a bridge onto the line near <unk> . The drivers of both the train and the lorry were killed . 
 5 September 1977 : <unk> was hauling a mail train when it was in a head @-@ on collision with a diesel multiple unit at <unk> Junction , Leeds , West Yorkshire due to a signalling fault . Two people were killed and fifteen were injured . 
 22 October 1979 : <unk> became the fifth Class 47 to be withdrawn after suffering severe damage in a fatal accident at <unk> in Scotland . <unk> was hauling a Glasgow to Aberdeen service which collided with a local train which had stopped in front . 
 9 December 1983 : <unk> ( formerly <unk> ) was involved in a serious accident at <unk> Junction in Lincolnshire , when whilst hauling an oil train , the locomotive collided with a local train resulting in the death of a passenger . It later emerged that the locomotive 's renumbering was allegedly due to a warning given to BR by a clairvoyant who claimed to have foreseen a serious accident involving a locomotive numbered <unk> . 
 30 July 1984 : <unk> Holyrood was propelling the 17 : 30 express from Edinburgh to Glasgow from the rear , when the train collided with a cow near <unk> and was derailed , resulting in 13 deaths . The accident raised serious concerns about the safety of push @-@ pull operation where the locomotive was at the rear of the train . 
 20 December 1984 : Summit Tunnel fire : Locomotive <unk> was hauling a freight train of petrol tankers which derailed and caught fire in Summit Tunnel , on the Lancashire / West Yorkshire border . 
 9 March 1986 : Locomotive No. <unk> was one of two light engines that were hit head @-@ on by a passenger train at <unk> , Derbyshire due to a signalman 's error . One person was killed . Lack of training and a power cut were contributory factors . 
 20 February 1987 : <unk> Amazon was hauling a freight train that ran away and was derailed by trap points at North Junction , <unk> , Derbyshire . Another train ran into the wreckage and was derailed . 
 24 March 1987 : <unk> was hauling a freight train that overran signals and was in a head @-@ on collision with a passenger train ( hauled by <unk> ) at Frome North Junction , Somerset . Several people were seriously injured .

 = Battle of Zutphen = 
 The Battle of Zutphen was fought on 22 September 1586 , near the village of Warnsveld and the town of Zutphen , the Netherlands , during the Eighty Years ' War . It was fought between forces of the United Provinces of the Netherlands , aided by the English , against the Spanish . In 1585 , England signed the Treaty of Nonsuch with the States @-@ General of the Netherlands and formally entered the war against Spain . Robert Dudley , Earl of Leicester , was appointed as the Governor @-@ General of the Netherlands and sent there in command of an English army to support the Dutch rebels . When Alessandro Farnese , Prince of Parma and commander of the Spanish Army of Flanders , besieged the town of Rheinberg during the Cologne War , Leicester , in turn , besieged the town of Zutphen , in the province of Gelderland and on the eastern bank of the river IJssel . 
 Zutphen was strategically important to Farnese , as it allowed his troops to levy war contributions in the rich Veluwe region . Therefore , he left some troops blockading Rheinberg and marched to relieve the town . He personally supplied Zutphen at first , but as the Anglo @-@ Dutch siege continued , he assembled a large convoy whose delivery to the town he entrusted to the Marquis of Vasto . Leicester learned of this when a courier dispatched by Farnese to Francisco Verdugo , the man in charge of Zutphen , was intercepted . The English and Dutch prepared an ambush , in which many English knights and noblemen were involved . In the end , the Spanish succeeded in delivering the convoy safely to Zutphen after a hard @-@ fought battle . The Spanish cavalry , composed mainly of Italian and Albanian soldiers , was defeated by the English cavalry under the Earl of Essex . The Spanish infantry , however , held its ground and delivered the convoy to Zutphen . From there , reinforced by Verdugo , the Spanish troops forced the English to retreat . 
 Zutphen was secured for the Spanish , though in the following weeks the English managed to capture a major Spanish fort , Zutphen 's sconce , on the bank of the IJssel river opposite the town . Most of the English gains were negated when , months later , the English governors of Deventer and Zutphen 's sconce defected to the Spanish ranks and handed over their places to Farnese . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1585 , Queen Elizabeth I of England took the United Provinces of the Netherlands under her protection and signed the Treaty of Nonsuch with the States @-@ General . England dispatched 5 @,@ 000 infantry and 1 @,@ 000 cavalry soldiers to the Low Countries , and Robert Dudley , Earl of Leicester , was proclaimed Governor @-@ General of the Netherlands . Commanding untrained and badly paid levies , Leicester was unable to prevent the Army of Flanders under Alessandro Farnese , from seizing the towns of Grave , Venlo and Neuss , though he managed to take Axel . 
 When Farnese besieged Rheinberg in September 1586 , Leicester 's army marched towards Zutphen and took a Spanish sconce on the left bank of the IJssel river . On 18 September Leicester laid a pontoon bridge over the IJssel and took positions on the right bank of the river , thus encircling Zutphen . Leicester 's Anglo @-@ Dutch army consisted of 8 @,@ 000 infantry – mainly English and Scottish , but also 1 @,@ 400 Irish – and 3 @,@ 000 cavalry . Robert Devereux , Earl of Essex , led the cavalry , John Norreys the infantry and William Pelham the camp , in which Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg , the deposed Archbishop of Cologne , and Manuel , son of the Prior of Crato , claimant to the Portuguese crown , all resided . 
 On receiving news of the siege , Farnese dispatched the governor of Friesland , Francisco Verdugo , to Borculo with 400 infantry and two cavalry companies , and Verdugo 's lieutenant Johann Baptista von Taxis to Zutphen with 600 infantry and two cavalry companies . As the siege continued , Farnese left some troops to blockade Rheinberg and supplied Zutphen in person with 600 cavalry and a convoy of 300 wagons of wheat . Leicester was in Deventer then , but on receiving news of Farnese 's approach , he returned to Zutphen 's camp . He found , on his arrival , that Counts Philip of Hohenlohe @-@ <unk> and William Louis of Nassau @-@ Dillenburg had entrenched the army on a mountain along the right bank of the IJssel . Leicester was informed of the possible ways through which the Spanish army might attempt to supply the town , but because of a misunderstanding no troops were deployed to guard the roads . 
 Led by Farnese himself and Francisco Verdugo , the Spanish troops left Borculo at night , passed next to the Dutch town of Lochem and reached Zutphen through a narrow way flanked by deep woods . Farnese prayed in the St. <unk> church and later on walked up its tower to watch the English army . The following morning a war council was held after a captured Scottish officer was interrogated and revealed Leicester 's plans and strength . Farnese considered the possibility of defending the town himself , but Verdugo dissuaded him to avoid " giving the Queen of England the fame that Prince of Parma was like a prisoner inside Zutphen " . Farnese returned to Borculo , entrusted the command of the town to Verdugo , and sent Taxis to guard a fort nearby . While the siege continued , he marched to Lingen with his army to intercept a corps of reiters who were being recruited in Germany under Elizabeth I 's orders . When he arrived , however , the reiters had dissolved for lack of pay . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Preparations = = = 
 To preserve Zutphen 's garrison , Farnese gathered enough food to feed 4 @,@ 000 men for three months in the towns of Groenlo , <unk> , Lingen and Münster . As this food was carried to Borculo , a large convoy was formed to resupply Zutphen . Farnese gave command of the mission to Alfonso Félix de <unk> Aquino y Gonzaga , Marquis del Vasto , under whom he put an escort of 2 @,@ 500 infantry − 1 @,@ 000 of them Spanish – and 600 Italian and Albanian cavalry , according to the Jesuit historian Famiano Strada , or just 600 infantry and 300 cavalry as claimed by the Spanish chronicler and soldier Alonso Vázquez , who was an eyewitness . On 21 September Farnese sent a letter to Verdugo commanding him to leave Zutphen with 1 @,@ 000 men , meet the convoy and deliver it to the town . Farnese 's courier , however , was intercepted near Lochem and Leicester learned of the convoy . Persuaded by one of his confidants , Captain Rowland York , he prepared an ambush . York had served for some years in the Dutch States Army before being imprisoned on charges of pretending to surrender Dendermonde to the Spanish . When Brussels fell to Farnese , he was freed and went to serve Leicester , whose confidence he earned . 
 Leicester waited for the Spanish convoy near the small village of Warnsveld , half a mile from Zutphen . Supported by the Earl of Essex , Sir John Norreys , Sir William Stanley , Lord Willoughby , his nephew the poet and courtier Sir Philip Sidney and William Russell , Leicester commanded 1 @,@ 500 infantry and 200 cavalry , according to the coeval English scholar Edward <unk> . Famiano Strada increases these numbers to 3 @,@ 000 infantry and 400 cavalry , and Alonso Vázquez to about 8 @,@ 000 , many of them veteran <unk> under Count William Louis of Nassau @-@ Dillenburg . The 19th century American historian John Lothrop Motley , on the other hand , reduces the strength of the English force to 200 cavalry and 300 pikemen , though adding that " a much stronger force of infantry was held in reserve and readiness " . The English soldiers , unlike the Dutch , were anxious to engage the Spanish troops . Rowland York told Leicester that he understood Spanish tactics , and that Spaniards were incomparable to English soldiers . 
 Leicester formed his army over a deep , narrow way , with the mountain where the Dutch were entrenched behind . He deployed his cavalry in two squadrons , formed a large infantry battalion , put 300 or 350 advanced pikemen under Sir William Stanley and Lord Audley next to the way , and flanked the road with sleeves of musketeers and arquebusiers . As the morning on 22 September was very misty , the English met the convoy before they expected . The Spanish cavalry opened the way followed by a battalion of foot , two sleeves of musketeers flanking the wagons , and some cavalry closing the way . Del Vasto left part of his cavalry near Lochem to guard the rear of the convoy . At 8 : 00 am , when the Spanish , led by the Marquis del Vasto himself , had passed Warnsveld , Stanley and Lord Audley began to skirmish with the Spanish vanguard . After the first clashes , the Earl of Essex charged upon the Spanish with the English cavalry , crying " Follow me , good fellows , for the honour of England and of England 's Queen ! " 
 = = = Ambush = = = 
 The Spanish vanguard was driven off by the English at the first charge , but the Spanish pikemen under Captains Pedro Manrique and Manuel de Vega , from Francisco de Bobadilla 's and Juan del Águila 's tercios , formed the defenders into squadron formation and kept the way open for the wagons . As the carters fled at the beginning of the fight , the Spanish arquebusiers had to take their places and brought the wagons towards Zutphen . Stanley 's pikemen charged upon the Spanish squadron , but they were repelled at the push of pike . As the fight approached Zutphen and Francisco Verdugo noticed the musketry fire , he ordered a wagon to be loaded with powder and bullets and sent it to the Spanish arquebusiers . The English cavalry , in the meantime , charged over the Spanish pikes on one of its flanks . Though they succeeded in breaking the two or three foremost ranks , Essex 's men could not penetrate further . Twice more the English charged upon the squadron , but they were as well repelled . 
 To reduce the pressure on the Spanish infantry , the Marquis del Vasto collected his cavalry and charged over Stanley 's infantry , being in turn repelled . He was nearly killed when an English soldier attacked him with a battleaxe , but a Spanish light horseman surnamed Arenas saved him by transfixing the English with his lance . Del Vasto retired from the fight and met Verdugo and Johann Baptista von Taxis , who sallied from Zutphen with several troops to join the battle . At the same time they were conversing , English troops unsuccessfully attacked Zutphen 's sconce on the other side of the IJssel , which was defended by Count Herman van den Bergh with some men . For a moment , Verdugo thought that the skirmish was inside Zutphen and the town burghers had risen in arms against the few Spanish troops he had left behind the walls . Leicester committed the same mistake , believing that the <unk> under Count William Louis of Nassau @-@ Dillenburg were fighting against the Spanish inside Zutphen . 
 During the confusion , the cavalry left behind by Del Vasto , which included the Italian and Epirote companies under <unk> Conti , Hannibal Gonzaga , George Crescia , the Marquis of Bentivoglio and Nicolo <unk> , reached Zutphen . Count Hannibal Gonzaga and the Albanian captain George Crescia attacked the English on their own , without Del Vasto 's orders . Crescia was dismounted and taken prisoner by Lord Willoughby , while Gonzaga , not wearing his close helmet , received a serious slash in the neck and fell from his horse . On the English side , Philip Sidney , governor of Vlissingen , was fatally wounded in a leg in the final charge . The Spanish cavalry then sought protection behind the infantry , which kept the English cavalry at bay . Verdugo , supported by the Albanian captain Nicolao Basta and the Spanish Evangelista de las Cuevas , Commissar General of the cavalry , managed to restore the order in the Spanish ranks . Seeing the good order of Verdugo and Del Vasto 's men , the English and Dutch commanders did not renew the action and began to retire back to their camp . A handful of Spanish pikemen , including some low ranking officers , disobeyed their orders and began to pursue the English . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Spanish soldier Alonso Vázquez labelled the Battle of Zutphen as " one of the best factions that until that time was ever seen in Flanders " . For many years it was common among Spaniards and Netherlanders to call a hard @-@ fought action " as warm as the fight of Zutphen " . According to John Lothrop Motley , " it is probable that the encounter would have been forgotten by posterity but by the melancholy close up upon that field to Sidney 's bright career " . Sidney allegedly had removed his <unk> when he saw that William Pelham was not wearing any . However , by the 1590s cavalry soldiers wore less armour than in the past , and this , instead of Sidney 's solidarity toward his companion , cost his life . Sidney was carried to the town of Arnhem to recover , but he died three weeks later of gangrene , as surgeons were unable to extract the bullet . Historians are uncertain about the number of casualties both sides suffered during the battle . Motley claims 13 horse and 22 foot killed on the English side , against ' perhaps ' 200 men on the Spanish side . On the other hand , Vázquez claimed that the Spanish " were winners with very little loss , having wounded and slaughtered many people to the rebels " . 
 On 12 October , for the third time , Farnese supplied the garrison of Zutphen , personally , as he had done the first time . Later on , he sent Verdugo back to Friesland and left Johann Baptista von Taxis in charge of Zutphen . After that , the Spanish army took its winter quarters . When Farnese moved to Brussels to spend the winter there , the Earl of Leicester continued the siege of Zutphen . He was not able to take the town , but succeeded in occupying several forts beyond the IJssel , including Zutphen 's sconce , which was carried by surprise by Edward Stanley , brother of William Stanley , and 12 other soldiers . Shortly after the English and Dutch also took their winter quarters . Sir William Stanley was given the command of Deventer , Sir John Burroughs of Duisburg , and Rowland York of Zutphen 's sconce . Stanley and York 's appointments were met with suspicion by the Dutch States , because Stanley was openly Catholic and York a man of dissolute character . Leicester expressed his full confidence in both soldiers , but in 1587 Stanley and York shifted sides to the Spanish party and handed Deventer and Zutphen 's sconce over to Taxis . 
 Stanley and York 's acts not only negated the gains of the 1586 campaign , but also undermined Leicester 's reputation and the Dutch States confidence in the English troops . The Dutch States decided to appoint Count Maurice of Nassau as Governor @-@ General of the Netherlands and Philip of Hohenlohe as his lieutenant . With the loss of Deventer and Zutphen 's sconce , the Spanish were able to levy war contributions in the provinces of Utrecht , Overijssel and Gelderland . Zutphen and Deventer remained in Spanish control until their capture in 1591 by Maurice of Nassau .

 The Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive is a scenic route within Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore , in western Northern Michigan in the United States . The roadway , with its " scenic vistas and gentle curves " , is located off state highway M @-@ 109 between Empire and Glen Arbor . It runs for 7 @.@ 4 miles ( 11 @.@ 9 km ) through forest and dunes areas , providing access to scenic overlooks of the Lake Michigan shoreline and the surrounding park land . Interpretive markers along the roadway are keyed to the National Park Service 's printed guide to the drive . Over 80 @,@ 000 vehicles make the trip , in addition to bicyclists , hikers and skiers who use the road each year . 
 The road was built in the 1960s and finished in 1967 by Pierce Stocking . A lumberman with road @-@ building experience , he wanted to share the beauty of the area with others . He operated the facility until his death in 1976 ; afterwards it was purchased by the National Park Service and added to the park . In the 1980s , a two @-@ year program reconstructed the roadway and added a number of features for visiting tourists . In 2011 , the morning show Good Morning America named the Sleeping Bear Dunes , and Pierce Stocking Drive , as the " Most Beautiful Place in America " after a viewer poll on its website ; publicity since the award has increased traffic along the roadway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The road is a 7 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 11 @.@ 9 km ) loop that can be driven or bicycled . Hiking the roadway is permitted , but not encouraged because of the traffic . The roadway starts at an entrance off M @-@ 109 ( DH Day Highway ) south of Glen Lake . There is a parking lot inside the entrance for visitors who wish to bike or hike the road . From there , the drive continues as a two @-@ way road to the entrance gate before turning northward as a one @-@ way road . There are 12 numbered locations along the road that are listed in the drive 's interpretive brochure . The first of these is a covered bridge . After this point , the drive ascends a steep hill to an overlook of Glen Lake . The area around this location includes " heavily forested areas , sand plains and scrub growth among the rock outcrops " . The next stop is the Dune Overlook and Picnic Mountain picnic area . From this vantage point , tourists can view both North and South Manitou islands , also part of the park , as well as Pyramid Point and Sleeping Bear Bay . As the drive approaches this stop and the fourth , the Cottonwood Trail , it emerges from the forest into the sandy dune area next to Lake Michigan . Several more stops are noted in the guide before Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive heads back inland through the beech and maple forest . 
 The roadway turns back to the shore and two overlooks next to the lake . Overlook 9 is next to the bluff on Lake Michigan , 450 feet ( 140 m ) above the water , and overlook 10 is for views of the Sleeping Bear Dune . From overlook 9 , visitors can see Platte Bay some nine miles ( 14 @.@ 5 km ) to the south on a clear day . These two locations are considered especially hazardous because of the heights involved . In 2002 , the Detroit Free Press noted that a half @-@ dozen visitors have to be rescued by paramedics at these two overlooks after falls . The community of Glen Arbor has a special off @-@ road vehicle to effect rescues from the base of the cliffs . The penultimate stop along the drive is the North Bar Overlook and Picnic Area , which provides vistas of North Bar Lake . After this stop , the drive descends into maple and pine forests before coming back to the starting point . This area follows an old logging road under the forest canopy . The drive has been called " the best way to see Lake Michigan from top of the dune elevations " , and " one of the nation 's most fascinating landscapes " . 
 A Park Pass fee is required for using the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive ( except for Golden Age Passport / Senior Pass holders ) . A free interpretive guide for the scenic drive is available at the visitor center in Empire , Michigan , or at the entrance gate . The road is open to cars generally from the middle of April into November . During the operating season , the road is open starting at 9 : 00 a.m. until 30 minutes after sunset . After late December , the drive is used as a cross @-@ country ski trail . The park service combines the unplowed roadway with the <unk> Hill Trail to form an eight @-@ mile ( 13 km ) system of trails of various ratings . The speed limit on the Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive is 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) . In 2008 , there were 82 @,@ 527 vehicles that circled the drive , a 4 @.@ 7 % increase over the previous year . 
 = = History = = 
 The road is named after Pierce Stocking , who spent his youth working as a Michigan lumberman and used to walk the bluffs above Lake Michigan near Empire . As a lumberman he had experience building roads . Stocking began building a road to the top of the dunes in the difficult terrain around the early 1960s . According to National Geographic , Stocking was " so awed by the beauty of the dunes that ... he built the road in order to share them with visitors . " The road was originally known as the Sleeping Bear Dunes Park when he first opened it to the public in 1967 . He operated the scenic drive until his death in 1976 , charging $ 2 per car ( equivalent to $ 8 @.@ 32 in 2015 ) at the end . 
 The area around the roadway became part of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore when the park was created in 1970 , and the road became part of the park itself in 1977 when purchased by the park service . The name was later changed to Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive in honor of the man . Starting in 1984 , the National Park Service reconstructed the drive . It was paved for the first time , and a bicycle lane was added . The service also moved the entrance to the road and built the observation platforms . An original section of the road was closed because it was susceptible to drifting sands from the dunes . Stocking built the covered bridge , but the " NPS has maintained it and increased its vertical clearance to 13 feet 6 inches [ 4 @.@ 11 m ] . " The renovations to the drive were completed in 1986 . 
 In August 2011 , the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore was named by Good Morning America as the " Most Beautiful Place in America " ; the designation came after a social media campaign to capitalize on the show 's website poll . Since the park was awarded the title , attendance has increased . Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive , featured in the morning show 's broadcast , had 0 @.@ 25 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) lines of cars waiting to get onto the drive on September 3 , 2011 , an uncommon sight for a day in September .

She was one of the original six frigates whose construction was authorized by the Naval Act of 1794 . Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young navy 's capital ships . Chesapeake was originally designed as a 44 @-@ gun frigate but construction delays , material shortages , and budget problems caused builder Josiah Fox to alter her design to 38 guns . Launched at the Gosport Navy Yard on 2 December 1799 , Chesapeake began her career during the Quasi @-@ War with France and saw service in the First Barbary War . 
 On 22 June 1807 she was fired upon by HMS Leopard of the Royal Navy for refusing to comply with a search for deserters . The event , now known as the Chesapeake – Leopard Affair , angered the American populace and government and was a precipitating factor that led to the War of 1812 . As a result of the affair , Chesapeake 's commanding officer , James Barron , was court @-@ martialed and the United States instituted the Embargo Act of 1807 against Great Britain . 
 Early in the War of 1812 she made one patrol and captured five British merchant ships before returning . She was captured by HMS Shannon shortly after sailing from Boston , Massachusetts , on 1 June 1813 . The Royal Navy took her into their service as HMS Chesapeake , where she served until she was broken up and her timbers sold in 1820 ; they are now part of the Chesapeake Mill in Wickham , England . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 American merchant vessels began to fall prey to Barbary Pirates , most notably from Algiers , in the Mediterranean during the 1790s . Congress responded with the Naval Act of 1794 . The Act provided funds for the construction of six frigates , and directed that the construction would continue unless and until the United States agreed to peace terms with Algiers . 
 Joshua Humphreys ' design was long on keel and narrow of beam ( width ) to allow for the mounting of very heavy guns . The design incorporated a diagonal scantling ( rib ) scheme to limit hogging ( warping ) and included extremely heavy planking . This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates . Since the fledgling United States could not match the numbers of ships of the European states , Humphreys designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates , but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line . 
 Originally designated as " Frigate D " , the ship remained unnamed for several years . Her keel was laid down in December 1795 at the Gosport Navy Yard in Norfolk , Virginia , where Josiah Fox had been appointed her naval constructor and Richard Dale as superintendent of construction . In March 1796 a peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers and construction was suspended in accordance with the Naval Act of 1794 . The keel remained on blocks in the navy yard for two years . 
 The onset of the Quasi @-@ War with France in 1798 prompted Congress to authorize completion of " Frigate D " , and they approved resumption of the work on 16 July . When Fox returned to Norfolk he discovered a shortage of timber caused by its diversion from Norfolk to Baltimore in order to finish Constellation . He corresponded with Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert , who indicated a desire to expedite construction of the ship and reduce the overall cost . Fox , always an opponent of Humphreys 's large design , submitted new plans to Stoddert which called for utilizing the existing keel but reducing the overall dimensions substantially in length and partially of beam . Fox 's plans essentially proposed an entirely different design than originally planned by Humphreys . Secretary Stoddert approved the new design plans . 
 When construction finished , she had the smallest dimensions of the six frigates . A length of 152 @.@ 8 ft ( 46 @.@ 6 m ) between perpendiculars and 41 @.@ 3 ft ( 12 @.@ 6 m ) of beam contrasted with her closest sisters , Congress and Constellation , which were built to 164 ft ( 50 m ) in length and 41 ft ( 12 m ) of beam . The final cost of her construction was $ 220 @,@ 677 — the second @-@ least expensive frigate of the six . The least expensive was Congress at $ 197 @,@ 246 . 
 During construction , a sloop named Chesapeake was launched on 20 June 1799 but was renamed Patapsco between 10 October and 14 November , apparently to free up the name Chesapeake for " Frigate D " . In communications between Fox and Stoddert , Fox repeatedly referred to her as Congress , further confusing matters , until he was informed by Stoddert the ship was to be named Chesapeake , after Chesapeake Bay . She was the only one of the six frigates not named by President George Washington , nor after a principle of the United States Constitution . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Chesapeake 's nominal rating is stated as either 36 or 38 guns . Originally designated as a 44 @-@ gun ship , her redesign by Fox led to a <unk> , apparently based on her smaller dimensions when compared to Congress and Constellation . Joshua Humphreys may have rerated Chesapeake to 38 guns , or Secretary Stoddert rerated Congress and Constellation to 38 guns because they were larger than Chesapeake , which was rated to 36 guns . The most recent information on her rating is from the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships , which states she was rerated " from 44 guns to 36 , eventually increased to 38 " . Her gun rating remained a matter of confusion throughout her career ; Fox used a 44 @-@ gun rating in his correspondence with Secretary Stoddert . In preparing for the War of 1812 Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton directed Captain Samuel Evans to recruit the number of crewmen required for a 44 @-@ gun ship . Hamilton was corrected by William Bainbridge in a letter stating , " There is a mistake in the crew ordered for the Chesapeake , as it equals in number the crews of our 44 @-@ gun frigates , whereas the Chesapeake is of the class of the Congress and Constellation . " Lastly , when sold for scrap by the Royal Navy in 1819 , she was rated as a 48 @-@ gun ship . 
 Gun ratings did not correspond to the actual number of guns a ship would carry . Chesapeake was noted as carrying 40 guns during her encounter with HMS Leopard and 50 guns during her engagement with HMS Shannon in 1813 . The 50 guns consisted of twenty @-@ eight 18 @-@ pounder ( 8 kg ) long guns on the gun deck , fourteen on each side . This main battery was complemented by two long 12 @-@ pounders ( 5 @.@ 5 kg ) , one long 18 @-@ pounder , eighteen 32 @-@ pounder ( 14 @.@ 5 kg ) carronades , and one 12 @-@ pound carronade on the spar deck . Her broadside weight was 542 pounds ( 246 kg ) . 
 The ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns ; guns were completely portable and were often exchanged between ships as situations warranted . Each commanding officer modified his vessel 's armaments to his liking while taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo , complement of personnel aboard , and planned routes to be sailed . Consequently , a vessel 's armament would change often during its career ; records of the changes were not generally kept . 
 = = Quasi @-@ War = = 
 Chesapeake was launched on 2 December 1799 during the undeclared Quasi @-@ War ( 1798 – 1800 ) , which arose after the French navy seized American merchant ships . Her fitting @-@ out continued through May 1800 . In March Josiah Fox was reprimanded by Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert for continuing to work on Chesapeake while Congress , still awaiting completion , was fully manned with a crew drawing pay . Stoddert appointed Thomas Truxton to ensure that his directives concerning Congress were carried out . 
 Chesapeake first put to sea on 22 May commanded by Captain Samuel Barron and marked her departure from Norfolk with a 13 @-@ gun salute . Her first assignment was to carry currency from Charleston , South Carolina , to Philadelphia . On 6 June she joined a squadron patrolling off the southern coast of the United States and in the West Indies escorting American merchant ships . 
 Capturing the 16 @-@ gun French privateer La Jeune Creole on 1 January 1801 after a chase lasting 50 hours , she returned to Norfolk with her prize on 15 January . Chesapeake returned briefly to the West Indies in February , soon after a peace treaty was ratified with France . She returned to Norfolk and decommissioned on 26 February , subsequently being placed in reserve . 
 = = First Barbary War = = 
 During the Quasi @-@ War , the United States had paid tribute to the Barbary States to ensure that they would not seize or harass American merchant ships . In 1801 Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli , dissatisfied with the amount of tribute in comparison to that paid to Algiers , demanded an immediate payment of $ 250 @,@ 000 . Thomas Jefferson responded by sending a squadron of warships to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace negotiations with the Barbary States . The first squadron was under the command of Richard Dale in President and the second was assigned to the command of Richard Valentine Morris in Chesapeake . Morris 's squadron eventually consisted of the vessels Constellation , New York , John Adams , Adams , and Enterprise . It took several months to prepare the vessels for sea ; they departed individually as they became ready . 
 Chesapeake departed from Hampton Roads on 27 April 1802 and arrived at Gibraltar on 25 May ; she immediately put in for repairs , as her main mast had split during the voyage . Morris remained at Gibraltar while awaiting word on the location of his squadron , as several ships had not reported in . On 22 July Adams arrived with belated orders for Morris , dated 20 April . Those orders were to " lay the whole squadron before Tripoli " and negotiate peace . Chesapeake and Enterprise departed Gibraltar on 17 August bound for Leghorn , while providing protection for a convoy of merchant ships that were bound for intermediate ports . Morris made several stops in various ports before finally arriving at Leghorn on 12 October , after which he sailed to Malta . Chesapeake undertook repairs of a rotted bowsprit . Chesapeake was still in port when John Adams arrived on 5 January 1803 with orders dated 23 October 1802 from Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith . These directed Chesapeake and Constellation to return to the United States ; Morris was to transfer his command to New York . Constellation sailed directly as ordered , but Morris retained Chesapeake at Malta , claiming that she was not in any condition to make an Atlantic voyage during the winter months . 
 Morris now had the ships New York , John Adams , and Enterprise gathered under him , while Adams was at Gibraltar . On 30 January Chesapeake and the squadron got underway for Tripoli , where Morris planned to burn Tripolitan ships in the harbor . Heavy gales made the approach to Tripoli difficult . Fearing Chesapeake would lose her masts from the strong winds , Morris returned to Malta on 10 February . With provisions for the ships running low and none available near Malta , Morris decided to abandon plans to blockade Tripoli and sailed the squadron back to Gibraltar for provisioning . They made stops at Tunis on 22 February and Algiers on 19 March . Chesapeake arrived at Gibraltar on 23 March , where Morris transferred his command to New York . Under James Barron , Chesapeake sailed for the United States on 7 April and she was placed in reserve at the Washington Navy Yard on 1 June . 
 Morris remained in the Mediterranean until September , when orders from Secretary Smith arrived suspending his command and instructing him to return to the United States . There he faced a Naval Board of Inquiry which found that he was censurable for " inactive and dilatory conduct of the squadron under his command " . He was dismissed from the navy in 1804 . Morris 's overall performance in the Mediterranean was particularly criticized for the state of affairs aboard Chesapeake and his <unk> as a commander . His wife , young son , and housekeeper accompanied him on the voyage , during which Mrs. Morris gave birth to another son . Midshipman Henry Wadsworth wrote that he and the other midshipman referred to Mrs. Morris as the " <unk> " and believed she was the main reason behind Chesapeake remaining in port for months at a time . Consul William Eaton reported to Secretary Smith that Morris and his squadron spent more time in port sightseeing and doing little but " dance and wench " than blockading Tripoli . 
 = = Chesapeake – Leopard Affair = = 
 In January 1807 Master Commandant Charles Gordon was appointed Chesapeake 's commanding officer ( Captain ) . He was ordered to prepare her for patrol and convoy duty in the Mediterranean to relieve her sister ship Constitution , which had been on duty there since 1803 . James Barron was appointed overall commander of the squadron as its Commodore . Chesapeake was in much disarray from her multi @-@ year period of inactivity and many months were required for repairs , provisioning , and recruitment of personnel . Lieutenant Arthur Sinclair was tasked with the recruiting . Among those chosen were three sailors who had deserted from HMS Melampus . The British ambassador to the United States requested the return of the sailors . Barron found that , although they were indeed from Melampus , they had been impressed into Royal Navy service from the beginning . He therefore refused to release them back to Melampus and nothing further was communicated on the subject . 
 In early June Chesapeake departed the Washington Navy Yard for Norfolk , Virginia , where she completed provisioning and loading armaments . Captain Gordon informed Barron on the 19th that Chesapeake was ready for sea and they departed on 22 June armed with 40 guns . At the same time , a British squadron consisting of HMS Melampus , Bellona , and Leopard ( a 50 @-@ gun fourth @-@ rate ) were lying off the port of Norfolk blockading two French ships there . As Chesapeake departed , the squadron ships began signaling each other and Leopard got under way preceding Chesapeake to sea . 
 After sailing for some hours , Leopard , commanded by Captain Salusbury Pryce Humphreys , approached Chesapeake and hailed a request to deliver dispatches to England , a customary request of the time . When a British lieutenant arrived by boat he handed Barron an order , given by Vice @-@ Admiral George Berkeley of the Royal Navy , which instructed the British ships to stop and board Chesapeake to search for deserters . Barron refused to allow this search , and as the lieutenant returned to Leopard Barron ordered the crew to general quarters . Shortly afterward Leopard hailed Chesapeake ; Barron could not understand the message . Leopard fired a shot across the bow , followed by a broadside , at Chesapeake . For fifteen minutes , while Chesapeake attempted to arm herself , Leopard continued to fire broadside after broadside until Barron struck his colors . Chesapeake only managed to fire one retaliatory shot after hot coals from the galley were brought on deck to ignite the cannon . The British boarded Chesapeake and carried off four crewmen , declining Barron 's offer that Chesapeake be taken as a prize of war . Chesapeake had three sailors killed and Barron was among the 18 wounded . 
 Word of the incident spread quickly upon Chesapeake 's return to Norfolk , where the British squadron that included Leopard was provisioning . Mobs of angry citizens destroyed two hundred water casks destined for the squadron and nearly killed a British lieutenant before local authorities intervened . President Jefferson recalled all US warships from the Mediterranean and issued a proclamation : all British warships were banned from entering US ports and those already in port were to depart . The incident eventually led to the Embargo Act of 1807 . 
 Chesapeake was completely unprepared to defend herself during the incident . None of her guns were primed for operation and the spar deck was filled with materials that were not properly stowed in the cargo hold . A court @-@ martial was convened for Barron and Captain Gordon , as well as Lieutenant Hall of the Marines . Barron was found guilty of " neglecting on the probability of an engagement to clear his Ship for action " and suspended from the navy for five years . Gordon and Hall were privately reprimanded , and the ship 's gunner was discharged from the navy . 
 = = War of 1812 = = 
 After the heavy damage inflicted by Leopard , Chesapeake returned to Norfolk for repairs . Under the command of Stephen Decatur , she made patrols off the New England coast enforcing the laws of the Embargo Act throughout 1809 . 
 The Chesapeake – Leopard Affair , and later the Little Belt Affair , contributed to the United States ' decision to declare war on Britain on 18 June 1812 . Chesapeake , under the command of Captain Samuel Evans , was prepared for duty in the Atlantic . Beginning on 13 December , she ranged from Madeira and traveled clockwise to the Cape Verde Islands and South America , and then back to Boston . She captured six ships as prizes : the British ships Volunteer , Liverpool Hero , Earl Percy , and Ellen ; the brig Julia , an American ship trading under a British license ; and Valeria , an American ship recaptured from British privateers . During the cruise she was chased by an unknown British ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and frigate but , after a passing storm squall , the two pursuing ships were gone the next morning . The cargo of Volunteer , 40 tons of pig iron and copper , were sold for $ 185 @,@ 000 . Earl Percy never made it back to port as she ran aground off the coast of Long Island , and Liverpool Hero was burned as she was considered leaky . Chesapeake 's total monetary damage to British shipping was $ 235 @,@ 675 . She returned to Boston on 9 April 1813 for refitting . 
 Captain Evans , now in poor health , requested relief of command . Captain James Lawrence , late of the Hornet and her victory over HMS Peacock , took command of Chesapeake on 20 May . Affairs of the ship were in poor condition . The term of enlistment for many of the crew had expired and they were daily leaving the ship . Those who remained were disgruntled and approaching mutiny , as the prize money they were owed from her previous cruise was held up in court . Lawrence paid out the prize money from his own pocket in order to appease them . Some sailors from Constitution joined Chesapeake and they filled the crew along with sailors of several nations . 
 Meanwhile , Captain Philip Broke and HMS Shannon , a 38 @-@ gun frigate , were patrolling off the port of Boston on blockade duty . Shannon had been under the command of Broke since 1806 and , under his direction , the crew held daily gun and weapon drills lasting up to three hours . Crew members who hit their bullseye were awarded a pound ( 454 g ) of tobacco for their good marksmanship . In this regard Chesapeake , with her new and inexperienced crew , was greatly inferior . 
 = = = Chesapeake vs Shannon = = = 
 Lawrence , advised that Shannon had moved in closer to Boston , began preparations to sail on the evening of 31 May . The next morning Broke wrote a challenge to Lawrence and dispatched it to Chesapeake ; it did not arrive before Lawrence set out to meet Shannon on his own accord . 
 Leaving port with a broad white flag bearing the motto " Free Trade and Sailors ' Rights " , Chesapeake met with Shannon near 5 pm that afternoon . During six minutes of firing , each ship managed two full broadsides . Chesapeake 's first broadside was fired while the ship was heeling , causing most hits on Shannon to strike the water or waterline causing little damage to Shannon although carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannon 's rigging . A second round of fire was more effective , landing hits on Shannon ' s 12 pounder shot locker . Chesapeake ' s 32 lb carronades punished Shannon 's forecastle , killing three men , wounding others and disabling Shannon ' s nine pounder bow gun . However Chesapeake suffered far more heavily in the exchange as accurate British fire caused heavy losses among American gun crews and crippling losses to the men and officers on Chesapeake 's quarterdeck . A succession of helmsmen were killed and her wheel itself was destroyed . At the same time , her <unk> halyard was shot away causing the ship to lose maneuverability . 
 Unable to maneuver , Chesapeake " <unk> up " and her port stern quarter caught against the side of the Shannon amidships and the two ships were lashed together . Confusion and disarray reigned on the deck of Chesapeake ; Captain Lawrence tried rallying a party to board Shannon , but the bugler failed to sound the call . At this point a shot from a sniper mortally wounded Lawrence ; as his men carried him below , he gave his last order : " Don 't give up the ship . Fight her till she sinks . " 
 Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake at the head of a party of 20 men . They met little resistance from Chesapeake 's crew , most of whom had run below deck . The only resistance from Chesapeake came from her contingent of marines . The British soon overwhelmed them ; only nine escaped injury out of 44 . Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle , being struck in the head with a sword . Soon after , Shannon 's crew pulled down Chesapeake 's flag . Only 15 minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture . 
 Reports on the number of killed and wounded aboard Chesapeake during the battle vary widely . Broke 's after @-@ action report from 6 July states 70 killed and 100 wounded . Contemporary sources place the number between 48 – 61 killed and 85 – 99 wounded . Discrepancies in the number of killed and wounded are possibly caused by the addition of sailors who died of their wounds in the ensuing days after the battle . The counts for Shannon have fewer discrepancies with 23 killed ; 56 wounded . Despite his serious injuries , Broke ordered repairs to both ships and they proceeded on to Halifax , Nova Scotia . Captain Lawrence died en route and was buried in Halifax with military honors . The British imprisoned his crew . Captain Broke survived his wounds and was later made a baronet . 
 = = Royal Navy service and legacy = = 
 The Royal Navy repaired Chesapeake and took her into service as HMS Chesapeake . She served on the Halifax station under the command of Alexander Dixie through 1814 , and under the command of George Burdett she sailed to Plymouth , England , for repairs in October of that year . Afterward she made a voyage to Cape Town , South Africa , until learning of the peace treaty with the United States in May 1815 . Later that year a report was made concerning Chesapeake 's performance in British service . Her captain observed that she was strongly constructed , but criticized the excessive overhang of the stern . He concluded that she was not a suitable ship to serve as a model for copying . Her speed under sail was not particularly impressive : 9 kn ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) close @-@ hauled and 11 kn ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) large . In July 1819 the Commissioners of the Royal Navy put her up for sale at Plymouth . A Portsmouth timber merchant purchased her for £ 500 ; he dismantled the ship and sold her timbers to Joshua Holmes for £ 3 @,@ 450 . Eventually her timbers became part of the Chesapeake Mill in Wickham , Hampshire , England , where one can still view them . In 1996 a timber fragment from the Chesapeake Mill was returned to the United States . It is on display at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum . 
 Almost from her beginnings , Chesapeake was considered an " unlucky ship " , the " runt of the litter " to the superstitious sailors of the 19th century , and the product of a disagreement between Humphreys and Fox . Her ill @-@ fated encounters with HMS Leopard and Shannon , the courts @-@ martial of two of her captains , and the accidental deaths of several crewmen led many to believe she was cursed . 
 Arguments defending both Humphreys and Fox regarding their long @-@ standing disagreements over the design of the frigates carried on for years . Humphreys disowned any credit for Fox 's redesign of Chesapeake . In 1827 he wrote , " She [ Chesapeake ] spoke his [ Fox 's ] talents . Which I leave the Commanders of that ship to estimate by her qualifications . " 
 Lawrence 's last command of " Don 't give up the ship ! " became a rallying cry for the US Navy . Oliver Hazard Perry , in command of naval forces on Lake Erie during September 1813 , named his flagship Lawrence , which flew a broad blue flag bearing the words " Dont give up the ship ! " The phrase is still used in the US Navy today . 
 Chesapeake 's blood @-@ stained and bullet @-@ ridden American flag was sold at auction in London in 1908 . Purchased by William Waldorf Astor , it now resides in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich , England , along with her signal book . The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax , Nova Scotia , holds several artifacts from the battle including the mess kettle , and an officers chest from Chesapeake . One of the 18 pounder guns from Chesapeake is mounted beside Province House , the Nova Scotia Legislature . 
 = Inchon ( film ) = 
 Inchon ( also called Inchon ! ) is a 1981 South Korean – American epic war film about the Battle of Inchon , considered to be the turning point of the Korean War . The film was directed by Terence Young and financed by Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon . It stars Laurence Olivier as General Douglas MacArthur , who led the United States surprise amphibious landing at Incheon , South Korea in 1950 . Also featured are Jacqueline Bisset , Ben Gazzara , Toshiro Mifune , and Richard Roundtree . It was filmed in California , Italy , Ireland , Japan and South Korea . 
 Inchon 's plot includes both military action and human drama . Characters face danger and are involved in various personal and dramatic situations . The film concludes with the American victory over North Korean forces in the Battle of Inchon , which is considered to have saved South Korea . The film cost $ 46 million to produce and encountered many problems during production , including a typhoon and the death of a cast member . Both the Unification Church and the United States military provided personnel as extras during the filming . 
 The film was released theatrically in the United States and Canada in September 1982 and then quickly withdrawn because of its poor performance at the box office . It has never been released on home video , although it has sometimes been broadcast on television . It was the largest financial loss in film of 1982 , earning less than $ 2 million . Reviewers at the time gave it consistently bad reviews and later commentators including Newsweek , TV Guide and Canadian Press have classed Inchon among the worst films of all time . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The film depicts the Battle of Inchon during the Korean War , which took place September 15 – 19 , 1950 and is considered the turning point of the war . The protagonist of the film is General Douglas MacArthur ( Laurence Olivier ) , who led the United States surprise amphibious landing at Incheon in 1950 . A subplot in the film involves an American couple who encounter difficulties in their relationship because of the ongoing war . 
 Inchon begins with North Korean soldiers moving past the 38th parallel north into South Korea in June 1950 . People flee into the country 's capital , Seoul . One of the displaced people is Barbara Hallsworth ( Jacqueline Bisset ) , a U.S. Army major 's wife who lives in a village on the 38th Parallel . She is <unk> to Seoul in a limousine , picking up five South Korean children along the way . After her chauffeur is killed , she drives them to a safe location called the Inn of the Sixth Happiness . Along the way , she shoots a North Korean soldier . 
 Meanwhile , her husband , Frank Hallsworth ( Ben Gazzara ) , is attempting to break off an affair with a young South Korean woman ( Karen Kahn ) . Her father ( Toshiro Mifune ) is aware of his daughter 's affair with Hallsworth and does not disapprove . Hallsworth receives word of the invasion by the North Koreans , and he travels north in an attempt to locate his wife with the assistance of army sergeant August Henderson ( Richard Roundtree ) . Henderson encounters Hallsworth 's wife and fixes her vehicle 's battery , and then reunites her with her husband . 
 Journalists David Feld Park ( David Janssen ) and Longfellow ( Rex Reed ) are attending a press conference held by MacArthur in Tokyo . MacArthur , however , does not show . He agrees with his wife ( Dorothy James ) that he is the only person who can rescue South Korea from the invasion by the North Koreans . 
 Hallsworth and his former lover succeed in turning on a lighthouse to signal 261 U.S. ships , and the South Korean woman 's father activates mines in the channel . She dies during the ensuing battle . The U.S. troops drive out the North Korean forces and the cheering people wave South Korean and American flags . The film proper ends with MacArthur reciting the Lord 's Prayer ; after this scene , a newsreel of MacArthur is shown . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Financing = = = 
 Inchon was financed by Sun Myung Moon and Japanese newspaper publisher Mitsu Haru Ishii . Moon was involved with the film 's production from the very beginning . Ishii , a member of the Unification Church in Japan and a friend of Moon , served as the film 's producer ; and Moon , although credited as " Special Advisor on Korean Matters " , contributed $ 30 million to Ishii 's film production company One Way Productions . Moon initially did not want the public to know that he was behind the financing of the film and its production . Ishii said he was instructed by God to make the film . Additional funding was provided by Robert Standard , the associate producer and a member of the Unification Church of the United States . 
 Ishii said he was a member of the Unification Church " just like a Catholic is a member of the Catholic Church and I believe Rev. Moon is very sincere about doing the Lord 's work " . Ishii was president of the World Daily News , which is published by Moon 's media conglomerate News World Communications which also published other newspapers , including The Washington Times in the United States . 
 Before deciding on making a war film , Moon and Ishii considered making biopics of Jesus or Elvis Presley . In 1978 , psychic Jeanne Dixon was consulted to communicate with the spirit of General MacArthur , and Dixon said that MacArthur 's spirit endorsed the production of the film . Dixon also helped choose Terence Young , known for the James Bond films Dr. No , Thunderball , and From Russia with Love , to direct the film . 
 Inchon cost $ 46 million to produce . Attempts to solicit funding from Japanese banks fell through , and so the entire project was funded by Moon and the Unification Church . 
 In his book Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America , author and scholar of religion J. Gordon Melton cites Inchon as an example when noting , " Moon has attempted to project his ideas into all areas of American society . " Moon later said in a talk to church members : " Why did we put so much effort into the movie Inchon ? No matter what the result the motivation was for people to understand about MacArthur . I wanted to show how MacArthur loved God and loved people . MacArthur came to Japan after World War II and put the nation back together . He really respected and loved the people . He also loved God very much and fought with great strength against tyranny and communism . That is what I want the people to understand . " 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Ishii was inspired to write a film with an international cast after watching a South Korean dramatization of the war . He wanted the film to be an " entertaining action film " , but also said he was " very interested in depicting MacArthur as a human being and I want the world to know how miserable the war was for the Korean people . " 
 Moore commented on the writing process : " The theme I had to deal with in Inchon was too big for a movie that was less than two hours . When Toho was originally involved , they wanted a love story between an American boy and a Korean girl . My technique is to research and then fictionalize , a technique I used successfully in French Connection . But I had to fictionalize the real landing at Inchon , making it seem that a lighthouse was a pivotal factor when in fact it wasn 't . I couldn 't do that , which is why other writers were brought in . " 
 Ishii instructed Moore to include an emphasis on General MacArthur 's spiritualism and faith in divine guidance . He told Moore to include three separate love stories in the film , " one between two Americans , one between two Koreans , and one between an American and a Korean " . Moore explained that " the love stories were supposed to tell the story of the tragedy of Korea , the tragedy of the Korean War " . Ishii stated to Moore that he did not wish for the movie to turn into an " anti @-@ Communist tract " . Prior to the completion of the film 's screenplay , the film 's producers encountered difficulties obtaining an affiliation with a movie studio . Ishii said that North Korea placed pressure on Toho Studios through labor unions in Japan , requesting that the studio pull out of its affiliation with Inchon . The labor unions criticized the film 's production , saying that it was influenced by Moon and his Unification Church , in addition to the Korean CIA and was part of an effort to support the president of South Korea . Because of this criticism , Toho Studios canceled its participation in the Inchon project . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Laurence Olivier was paid $ 1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film . He was contracted for six weeks of filming , and received a payment of $ 250 @,@ 000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments . His salary came out to $ 50 @,@ 000 per day . In addition to this fee , Olivier also received $ 2 @,@ 500 per week for his expenses . Olivier was interviewed during the film 's production and explained why he agreed to be part of its cast : " People ask me why I 'm playing in this picture . The answer is simple . Money , dear boy . I 'm like a vintage wine . You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour . I 'm almost used up now and I can feel the end coming . That 's why I 'm taking money now . I 've got nothing to leave my family but the money I can make from films . Nothing is beneath me if it pays well . I 've earned the right to damn well grab whatever I can in the time I 've got left . " 
 Olivier researched the role by traveling to Norfolk , Virginia to visit the MacArthur Museum , and speaking with Alexander Haig , who had served as aide @-@ de @-@ camp to MacArthur . Haig told Olivier that MacArthur 's voice sounded like W. C. Fields , and Olivier tried to imitate this . He enjoyed working with accents , and obtained recordings of MacArthur 's voice . He was interested in various inconsistencies in these recordings , and especially in the difference in vowel sounds made by MacArthur . During filming , the makeup process for Olivier took two and a half hours , but after it was complete , he thought he neither looked like himself nor like General MacArthur . 
 The 72 @-@ year @-@ old Olivier , who had been in poor health for years , suffered during filming in Seoul because of the summer heat . Director Terence Young recalled that between takes Olivier lay on a cot , virtually immobile with pain and exhaustion , but that when needed " he dropped fifty years and stepped forward without complaint " . 
 Richard Roundtree , known for the title role in the film Shaft , portrayed the character of Staff Sgt. Henderson in the film . David Janssen , known for his role in the TV series The Fugitive , accepted a part as a journalist to work with Laurence Olivier . Actress Karen Kahn portrayed the young Korean lover of Major Frank Hallsworth in the film . In a subsequent interview with The Press Democrat , Kahn said of the film : " It was supposed to be this Gone with the Wind . And it was the worst movie . It 's in some of those worst @-@ films @-@ of @-@ all @-@ time books . After that movie I quit . I just couldn 't take L.A. I was really thin @-@ skinned . So I just got out . "

 Jerry Goldsmith wrote the score for the film . The music was recorded at Rome 's Forum Studio in July 1980 , and was fraught with difficulties — the studio was not large enough for his orchestra , and room noise made by the players and their equipment affected the tracks . 
 In spite of the problems , Goldsmith was pleased with his score , describing it as a chance to " create interesting music out of a bad situation " . The original 1982 soundtrack LP comprised 38 minutes of music , edited and assembled by Goldsmith and engineer Leonard Engel into an ideal listening experience rather than a chronological one . The album was issued on Regency Records ; Intrada Records prepared a remixed edition of the complete score in 1988 . In 2006 Intrada revisited the score and issued a two @-@ disc set , with the original LP making its compact disc debut on disc 1 and the entire score presented in film order on disc 2 .

 Shooting took place in Hollywood , Rome , Ireland , Tokyo and Seoul . The involvement of Moon was " adamantly denied " . Moon recommended editing and reshooting changes to the film 's script , which " caused the production to return to South Korea three times , Rome twice and Los Angeles twice . " 
 The film included several technical errors . Cut @-@ out cardboard pieces were used to depict military aircraft during battle scenes in the film , and one film critic said viewers were almost able to identify the threads attached to the cardboard cut @-@ outs . Footage of a digital watch was spliced into the film , though this technology would not be invented for twenty @-@ five years after the film 's time period . There were other problems . Jacqueline Bisset developed laryngitis during the film 's production . A set @-@ piece for the film included a re @-@ created version of a lighthouse at Incheon , but this was obliterated by a typhoon . The death of David Janssen during production called for extensive reshoots . 
 The production hired Samuel <unk> , a retired Marine Corps Lieutenant General who took part in the Battle of Inchon as a company commander , as technical advisor to the film . A portion of the movie was filmed aboard the USS Cleveland , an Austin @-@ class amphibious transport dock during an amphibious operation off the coast of South Korea in 1978 . The United States Department of Defense allowed 1 @,@ 500 soldiers from the United States Army and United States Marine Corps to participate as extras in the film , at a cost of $ 77 @,@ 000 . 
 The Little Angels Children 's Folk Ballet of Korea , founded by Moon in 1962 , were featured in the film , along with many Unification Church members . After shooting had finished in South Korea , Olivier returned to England . He was needed in South Korea to shoot the final scene , but as a concession to his poor health , was allowed to film in Rome instead . The film 's director Terence Young was not happy with the completed version of the film , and said " the producers have turned Inchon into a Korean propaganda movie . " Ishii said : " No problem . We have 20 nations who want this movie . "

 The world premiere of the film was held in Washington , D.C. on May 4 , 1981 at a special screening at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts , as a benefit for retired United States Navy personnel chaired by Senator Alfonse D 'Amato . This was the only time the film was screened in its 140 @-@ minute full version . Between 25 and 100 protesters came to demonstrate outside the Center . 
 Twelve Congressmen signed on as honorary members of the benefit committee . Although an additional forty @-@ eight Members of Congress accepted tickets to the premiere , Lawrence H. Suid wrote in Guts & Glory that " ... no more than fifteen or sixteen were willing to brave the pickets outside the Kennedy Center protesting the Unification Church and its involvement with the movie . " 
 On February 13 , 1982 , President Ronald Reagan , himself a former film actor and president of the Screen Actors Guild , screened the film in the White House . He noted in his diary : " Ran Inchon — it is a brutal but gripping picture about the Korean War and for once we 're the good guys and the Communists are the villains . The producer was Japanese or Korean which probably explains the preceding sentence " . 
 Inchon was shown at the 35th Cannes film festival in May 1982 but failed to interest any buyers despite a $ 250 @,@ 000 publicity campaign , which included hiring the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan to arrange a large party and give out promotional Inchon jackets . 
 In August 1982 , MGM / UA contracted the distribution rights to the film . One Way Productions came to an agreement with MGM that it would take care of the costs associated with advertising and distributing the film , if MGM agreed to distribute Inchon for a profit share of only 15 percent . The normal fee for the film distributor was thirty percent of profits . The film , cut to 105 minutes , was released in the United States on the weekend of September 17 , 1982 . It was swiftly pulled from theater distribution because of its poor performance at the box office , and was never shown in the United Kingdom . 
 After its release , Inchon was never again shown in theaters , and was never released on videocassette or DVD . It did however air on U.S. cable television outlet <unk> Television Network ( now called <unk> America ) , at the time owned by the Unification Church . Bootleg copies of the film circulated from individuals that had copied Inchon from these television broadcasts .

 The Unification Church wanted to distribute the film on their own , but Young told them this would result in a " total disaster " . The Church did however front the full $ 11 million promotion budget . The press releases made many mystical claims , such as of a B @-@ 29 bomber pilot seeing the face of Jesus Christ during the war , or of MacArthur 's spirit causing his face to appear on a photograph of his office door . The press kit also claimed that MacArthur supported the film .

 The film 's total North American gross was $ 1 @.@ 9 million . It eventually took in $ 5 @.@ 2 million at the box office . Inchon lost over $ 44 million , and was the year 's largest financial failure in film . In 1989 , a survey released by the entertainment research firm Baseline identified Inchon as " the biggest box @-@ office fiasco of the 1980s " . 
 Inchon has been included on multiple lists of box office bombs . Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune placed Inchon as number six in a " list of Hollywood 's 10 worst mega @-@ flops " . Wilmington noted that Inchon displaced the 1980 film Heaven 's Gate as " the bomb of the decade " . The Washington Post described Inchon as " one of the biggest commercial disasters in film history " . In 1995 , the San Francisco Chronicle reported that The Guinness Book of World Records called Inchon " the biggest money @-@ loser in film history " . Inchon was one of the " 10 costliest movies " , adjusted for inflation , at $ 173 million in 1997 dollars . In a 2006 list of " The top 10 biggest box office failures " , Kat <unk> of MSN Movies placed Inchon as tied with Battlefield Earth for number seven .

 Most newspaper reviewers gave Inchon negative reviews ; among them were The Boston Globe , The Philadelphia Inquirer , The Miami Herald , and The Washington Post . In The New York Times , critic Vincent Canby commented , " Inchon is a hysterical historical epic , somewhat less offensive than The Green Berets and far funnier . ... ' Inchon ' looks like the most expensive B @-@ movie ever made . " A review in the influential entertainment @-@ trade magazine Variety commented , " Olivier is convincing in his role throughout most of the saga , the only member of the cast to achieve that status . Screenplay generally treats all others as one @-@ dimensional buffoons , giving them lines that are unintentionally laughable . One reason is that all plot digressions are simply window dressing to the film 's focus on the brutally invading North Koreans and the big @-@ scale counterattack by the good guys . No speaking roles are given to the Communists , for example . " 
 Moon founded The Washington Times in Washington D.C. as a part of his international media conglomerate News World Communications in the same year Inchon was released . According to The Times ' rival The Washington Post , a full @-@ length two and a half page version of a film review of Inchon written by critic Scott Sublett that was originally planned for the September 16 , 1982 issue of The Times was killed by the newspaper 's publisher and editor James R. Whelan . Whelan told Sublett that The Times had a conflict of interest with regard to reviewing Inchon , and would not print his review . Instead , The Times printed a one @-@ paragraph critical synopsis of the film , also written by Sublett , which said in full : " <unk> dialogue , perfunctory acting and haphazard construction doom from the start this visually impressive would @-@ be epic about love and dead Reds in wartime Korea . Olivier ( in a performance that is the nadir of his career ) <unk> , <unk> and rolls his eyes absurdly as Doug MacArthur . The script , by Robin Moore , is pure twaddle – a cross between South Pacific and The Green Berets . " Moore is the author of the novel The Green Berets , upon which the 1968 movie was based . On Monday the 21st The Times ran The New York Times review of the film . Reviewers Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert selected the film as one of the worst of the year in a 1982 episode of their program Sneak Previews . 
 = = = Later commentary = = = 
 Multiple commentators have described Inchon as the worst film ever made , including The Washington Post , Newsweek , TV Guide , and the Canadian Press . Inchon was later profiled in multiple books on worst in film , including The Hollywood Hall of Shame by Harry and Michael Medved , and The Worst Movies of All Time by Michael Sauter . In 2000 , Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley , writing in the libertarian magazine Reason , said about a proposed film on Stalinism : " A film like this could easily have turned out as big a didactic dud as the Rev. Sun Myung Moon 's 1982 bomb , Inchon , with Laurence Olivier as Gen. Douglas MacArthur . " A 2009 review by Phil Hall for Film Threat was less negative , and he disagreed with the characterization of the film as the worst ever made , " I was genuinely surprised — this is hardly among the very worst films of all time . That 's not to say it is a good film . It is a dull and forgettable movie , and I would never recommend it . However , its reputation for being among the bottom of the cinematic barrel is wholly undeserved . " 
 A review in Brassey 's Guide to War Films by Alun Evans was critical , calling the film " Arguably the worst war picture made in the last quarter of the 20th century " . Robert Niemi commented in his book History in the Media : Film and Television , " Plagued with a terrible script , horrendous production problems , and shoddy performances all around , the resulting film , Inchon ... was bad beyond belief . " Niemi wrote that Olivier 's performance " was a low point in an otherwise distinguished film career " . In his biography of the actor , Olivier , author Terry Coleman called the film " probably the worst he ever made and one of the best paid " . Author Lawrence H. Suid wrote in Guts and Glory : The Making of the American Military Image in Film that , " what combat the film portrayed lacked any believability or authenticity ... As a result , the movie met with almost unanimous critical disdain . " Moon 's 2009 autobiography , As a Peace @-@ Loving Global Citizen , does not mention Inchon , nor did he or the Unification Church ever produce another major commercial motion picture .

The EP is a big departure from their previous works in terms of musical style , its few post @-@ dubstep elements to be the only ones that were also present on their past releases . Promoted one single , " Boiling " , and one music video for " Control " , The Face garnered critical acclaim , major praises being towards the quality of the EP 's musical style and song structures .

 The Face fuses the styles of balearic beat , UK garage , dubstep and techno . A DIY magazine critic , described The Face as a more " youthful " part of a dubstep and techno scene consisting of acts like James Blake and Little Dragon . XLR8R reviewer Glenn Jackson , noted that the EP 's post @-@ dubstep elements were the only ones on the record to have also been included on the duo 's earlier works . 
 " Boiling " , which starts The Face , opens with a R & B @-@ infused landscape of " bruised color " synths , which are mostly associated with the works of future garage artists such as Jacques Greene , backing alto vocals by Sinéad Harnett . Big keyboard sounds , a deep house bassline , percussion including finger snaps and hi @-@ hats commonly found in early 1990s garage music then pop into the song , as well as reverb effects on the vocals , before some bubbly synth textures " unravel " the song . " What 's In Your Head " contains chops of high @-@ pitched voice samples , a " distorted @-@ beyond @-@ recognition orgasm sample , " and " spacey " " sun @-@ bleached " synthesizers . The later part of the track consists of a harsh drum beat , stuttering vocal chops and " vamping " synth lines . According to The 405 's James West , the song includes pop music elements similar to those in Be Strong , an album by duo The 2 Bears . Writing for Resident Advisor , Phillip Sherburne described the song 's vocal snippets as cleaner versions of those found in the 1997 track " Fly Life " by Basement Jaxx . 
 " Control " , with its main instrumental element identical to that of the beginning of " What 's in Your Head " , contains an " ethereal " arrangement of restrained synth sounds , bass drops mostly associated with those in tracks by El @-@ B and M. J. Cole , " fidgety " drums , and staccato note singing from Ria Ritchie . The track starts flowing into a " widescreen reverb heavy fog " containing sustained and echo @-@ filtered vocals before the instrumental turns minimalist again , a structure compared by Simon Edmunds of <unk> to the " old loud / quiet / loud trick " that was prominent in many tracks by rock band Nirvana . " Control " is the only cut on the release to have a 2 @-@ step drum rhythm , unlike the EP 's three other tracks that are driven by four @-@ on @-@ the @-@ floor drum beats . The Face closes with the most playful cut on the EP , the balearic techno song " <unk> " .

 The Face garnered generally positive reviews from music journalists upon its release , later landing at number two and nine on the year @-@ end lists of publications Beats per Minute and Pretty Much Amazing , respectively . Edmunds said that " releasing music of this quality at such an early age and so early into their career only makes one excited as to what the future holds for them " , concluding his review that " The Face acts as a reminder to other producers to stay at the top of their game , because the kids are coming up from behind " . Will Ryan , writing for Beats per Minute , called the record 's four songs to be the some of the best club tracks of all time , labeling it a " complete statement that overloads all possible cylinders , as vital as the ages of the producers behind it might suggest , delivered by a duo whose rise can only just qualify as meteoric " . Sherburne , when interviewing Disclosure for Spin magazine , honored the EP as the duo 's " best and most varied " release , noting its production to be " yielding a high @-@ end that ’ s filigreed with crystal and compression so pneumatic that it seems to suck the air from your lungs " . 
 DIY magazine highlighted the " effortless " aspect in how Disclosure made the tracks , stating that " there is a coherence that flows throughout without becoming stagnant which personifies the understanding the Lawrence brothers have not only for their desired results but for each other " . West wrote that The Face was on the same level as the works of Jamie xx , Bobby Tank and SBTRKT , making Disclosure " the country 's most exciting new producers " . He also honored the EP for being one of the few releases to combine different styles together " cleverly " . Jackson also compared The Face to SBTRKT 's material , given that the record successfully works for both a club environment and a mainstream pop audience . However , his major criticisms were that all the tracks were too similar to each other , a problem further hurt by the EP 's longer @-@ than @-@ 20 @-@ minute runtime , and the vocal features were " underwhelming " . One negative review from a Drowned in Sound critic called The Face a " disappointing miscalculation of <unk> trends with little real personality of its own " that could only be enjoyed in a club setting , writing that the same " soulfulness " that was a major part of music by Joy Orbison was hard to find on the EP .

Along with a double agent , Olivia 's investigation is hampered by the appearance of Sanford Harris , an old adversary hired to audit Fringe Division . 
 The episode was written by series co @-@ creators J.J. Abrams , Alex Kurtzman , and Roberto Orci , as well as executive producer Jeff Pinkner . Frederick E. O. Toye served as the episode 's director , and sought to create a " creepy and weird " atmosphere for Olivia 's kidnapping scene to help emphasize her " terrible circumstances .

In addition , the episode was the first to feature Ari Graynor as Olivia 's sister , Rachel .

 The episode first aired on January 20 , 2009 on the Fox network , and was watched by an estimated 11 @.@ 96 million viewers .

 Following Olivia Dunham 's ( Anna Torv ) kidnapping from the previous episode , " Safe " , Fringe Division works to find her location . Unbeknownst to her , one of Olivia 's captors is Fringe agent Mitchell Loeb ( Chance Kelly ) . He gives her a spinal tap and returns to help with the investigation . Olivia fights off the remaining men and escapes , taking several medical samples with her . She hides the samples right before being arrested by Sanford Harris ( Michael Gaston ) , a former adversary who was hired to audit Fringe Division . Years before , Olivia exposed and prosecuted Harris for sexually assaulting three female Marine privates , and he now wants revenge . Now recovering in Boston Hospital , Olivia 's judgment is questioned by Harris for working with the mentally unstable scientist Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) and his law @-@ breaking son Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) . Harris tells her she cannot investigate her own abduction . 
 Back at Fringe Division , Olivia learns that the building she was kept at is empty and contains no traces of her captors . Olivia , along with Walter and Peter , recovers the hidden samples . They soon hear of the murder of epidemiologist Miles Kinberg , who was killed by a chemical which created a giant , slug @-@ like single cell of acute viral <unk> in his stomach . Olivia learns that Kinberg was about to start a job at the Centers for Disease Control , and that another scientist , Dr. Russell Simon , is also set to begin working there . She connects Kinberg 's killers with her own captors based on the similarities of her stolen samples . Fringe Division brings Simon in for protection but he is killed soon after when Loeb gives him the same chemical agent . 
 Meanwhile , Olivia 's sister Rachel ( Ari Graynor ) and niece Ella ( Lily Pilblad ) come to visit . Olivia succeeds in connecting the murder to Loeb by recognizing his shoes from when she was a captive . She goes to search his house but accidentally runs into his wife and accomplice , Samantha ( Trini Alvarado ) . Loeb tells his wife to kill Olivia , and after a struggle , Olivia fatally shoots Samantha . Olivia obtains the necessary evidence to capture Loeb and questions him about her abduction . She gets little information until she shows him pictures of his dead wife , as he was unaware she was killed . Loeb angrily tells Olivia about " two sides " and that he was trying to save her .

 " Bound " was written by co @-@ creators J.J. Abrams , Alex Kurtzman , and Roberto Orci , and executive producer Jeff Pinkner . Producer Frederick E. O. Toye worked as the director . For Olivia 's spinal tap scene , Toye attempted to create a " creepy and weird " atmosphere . He explained , " She 's strapped down , she 's in a gurney . They 're going to pull fluid out of her spine . It 's creepy and weird . That 's what we 're going for , to try and set it up as a really awkward , horrible environment to be trapped in . " Toye and the crew wanted to make it " as visually interesting and dramatic as possible , " and added in dripping water and " creepy " lighting to emphasize Olivia 's " terrible circumstances . " First assistant director Gary Rake noted that the episode " took the character Olivia to a higher level ... She 's a lot more active , which is very exciting for us . " 
 According to Orci , the idea behind the episode 's fringe case originated with the show 's " amazing scientific consultants , " who suggested " super @-@ sizing a common virus " when the writers were trying to brainstorm episode cases . Andrew Orloff , the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios , considered it one of the most challenging effects his company made for the season . 
 Up to the point the episode aired , Anna Torv considered it her favorite episode , explaining , " In ‘ Bound , ’ when Olivia gets kidnapped , they ’ re giving her a spinal tap and she wakes up and breaks out – it was just bang , bang , bang , bang , bang . I found it really easy to follow and kind of energetic , and I really loved filming that . " In reference to Trini Alvarado , the other actress in their fight scene , Torv also mentioned when shooting it " We had so much fun ! That 's probably my favorite sequence in the show thus far . " 
 Actor Joshua Jackson believed the episode was important developmentally for the series , explaining it was " creatively when the show really hit its stride in the first season . " Jackson continued , " I think right around the midway point of [ the first ] season the show decided what it wanted to be . From about the midway , point it got on a pretty good streak of episodes . I can ’ t remember the exact number , but the two @-@ part episode where Dunham gets kidnapped . After that , it was pretty clear ; we introduced the bad guys for the season and there was a much clearer narrative drive through the rest of the season . " 
 In December 2008 , Entertainment Weekly reported that actress Ari Graynor would be joining the cast as a guest star for a minimum of three episodes , beginning in January . Her character , Olivia 's younger sister Rachel , would be visiting Olivia for a few weeks because " she 's dealing with some man trouble back home " , as described by an insider . " Bound " marked the first episode to feature the new character . Other guest actors included Chance Kelly , Michael Gaston , Lily <unk> , Sara Wilson , Stephen <unk> , and Peter Jay Fernandez .

" Olivia 's " amazing " action sequence reminded Isler of the Fox television show 24 , and he equated Olivia with that series ' protagonist Jack Bauer . Writing for The A.V.

" Jane Boursaw of TV Squad enjoyed the episode ; like Isler , she also compared Olivia to Jack Bauer , and expressed suspicion that new characters Rachel and Ella were " part of a bigger conspiracy " . 
 Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha compared Olivia to the character Sydney Bristow from the television series Alias , and opined that Fringe " continues to exhibit a satisfying stride . " Griffin however was disappointed that events from the previous episode were ignored , believing it to be a mistake to continue emphasising formulaic storytelling rather than a serialized format . Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times felt that despite the extra ten minutes , " Bound " was " more like a two @-@ hour episode ... being crammed into half the time " . He thought the episode 's four writers were " all busy " , as there were three stories going on at once , and compared Olivia to the similarly characterized Lost character Jack Shephard . Hanson concluded , " But how bad can it be when my biggest complaint about a show is that I want more ? And now that the cold winter of reruns has passed , we should be getting just that . " 
 Television Without Pity graded the episode with a B. Various reviewers disliked the character Sanford Harris , calling him " stereotypical , " one @-@ note " , and " unconvincing .

 = Lawton , Oklahoma = 
 The city of Lawton is the county seat of Comanche County , in the State of Oklahoma . Located in southwestern Oklahoma , about 87 mi ( 140 km ) southwest of Oklahoma City , it is the principal city of the Lawton , Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area . According to the 2010 census , Lawton 's population was 96 @,@ 867 , making it the fifth @-@ largest city in the state . 
 Built on former reservation lands of Kiowa , Comanche , and Apache Indians , Lawton was founded on August 6 , 1901 , and was named after Major General Henry Ware Lawton , a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient killed in action in the Philippine – American War . Lawton 's landscape is typical of the Great Plains , with flat topography and gently rolling hills , while the area north of the city is marked by the Wichita Mountains . 
 The city 's proximity to Fort Sill Military Reservation gave Lawton economic and population stability throughout the 20th century . Although Lawton 's economy is still largely dependent on Fort Sill , it has also grown to encompass manufacturing , higher education , health care , and retail . The city 's government is run by a council @-@ manager government consisting of a city manager and a city council headed by a mayor . Interstate 44 and three major United States highways serve the city , while Lawton @-@ Fort Sill Regional Airport connects Lawton by air . Recreation can be found at the city 's many parks , lakes , museums , and festivals . Notable residents of the city include many musical and literary artists , as well as several professional athletes . 
 = = History = = 
 The land that is present @-@ day Oklahoma was first settled by prehistoric American Indians including the Clovis <unk> BCE , Folsom 10600 BCE and Plainview 10000 BCE cultures . Historic indigenous peoples who inhabited the region included the Wichita and Caddo peoples . In the 16th century , Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado visited in 1541 , beginning European contact . Around the 1700s , two tribes from the north , the Comanches and Kiowas , migrated to the Oklahoma and Texas region . 
 For most of the 18th century , the Oklahoma region was under nominal French control as Louisiana . The limited interaction between the peoples was based on fur trading . In 1803 , the Louisiana Purchase by Thomas Jefferson brought the area under United States control . In 1830 , Congress passed the Indian Removal Act , which removed American Indian tribes from the Southeast and relocated them to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River . The southern part of this territory was originally assigned to the Choctaw and Chickasaw . In 1867 , the United States used the Medicine Lodge Treaty to allot the southwest portion of the Choctaw and Chickasaw ’ s lands to the Comanche , Kiowa , and Apache tribes . 
 Fort Sill was established in 1869 after the American Civil War by Major General Philip Sheridan , who was leading a campaign in the Indian Territory to stop raids into Texas by American Indian tribes . In 1874 , the Red River War broke out in the region when the Comanche , Kiowa , and Southern Cheyenne left their Indian Territory reservation . Attrition and skirmishes by the US Army finally forced the return of the tribes back to Indian Territory in June 1875 . 
 In 1891 , the United States Congress appointed a commission to meet with the tribal leaders and come to an agreement allowing white settlement . Years of controversy and legal maneuvering ensued before President William McKinley issued a proclamation on July 4 , 1901 , that gave the federal government control over 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 @,@ 100 km2 ) of surplus Indian land . Under other legislation , the United States through the Dawes Commission allotted communal lands as plots to individual households of tribal members , selling off what remained as " surplus . " These actions extinguished the tribal claims to communal lands , a condition needed for the admission of Oklahoma as a state in 1907 . 
 After these changes , the legislature of the new state began to organize counties . Three 320 @-@ acre sites in Kiowa , Caddo and Comanche counties were selected for county seats , with Lawton designated as the Comanche County seat . The town was named for Major General Henry W. Lawton , a quartermaster at Fort Sill , who had taken part in the pursuit and capture of Geronimo . The city was opened to settlement through an auction of town lots beginning on August 6 , 1901 , which was completed 60 days later . By September 25 , 1901 , the Rock Island Railroad expanded to Lawton and was soon joined by the Frisco Line . The first city elections were held October 24 , 1901 . 
 The United States ' entry into World War I accelerated growth at Fort Sill and Lawton . The availability of 5 million US gallons ( 19 @,@ 000 m3 ) of water from Lake Lawtonka , just north of Fort Sill , was a catalyst for the War Department to establish a major cantonment named Camp Doniphan , which was active until 1922 . Following World War II , Lawton enjoyed steady population growth , with the population increasing from 18 @,@ 055 to 34 @,@ 757 from 1940 to 1950 . By the 1960s , it had reached 61 @,@ 697 . 
 In the postwar period , Lawton underwent tremendous growth during the late 1940s and 1950s , leading city officials to seek additional water sources to supplement existing water from Lake Lawtonka . In the late 1950s , the city purchased large parcels of land along East Cache Creek in northern Comanche County for the construction of a man @-@ made lake with a dam built in 1959 on the creek just north of U.S. 277 west of Elgin . Lake Ellsworth , named for a former Lawton mayor , soft @-@ drink bottler C.R. Ellsworth , was dedicated in the early 1960s . It offered additional water resources , but also recreational opportunities and flood control along Cache Creek . 
 In 1966 , the Lawton City Council annexed several miles of land on the city 's east , northeast , west , and northwest borders , expanding east beyond the East Cache Creek area and west to 82nd Street . On March 1 , 1964 , the north section of the H. E. Bailey Turnpike was completed , connecting Lawton directly to Oklahoma City , the capital . The south section of the turnpike leading to the Texas border was completed on April 23 , 1964 . Urban renewal efforts in the 1970s transformed downtown Lawton . A number of buildings dating to the city 's founding were demolished to build an enclosed shopping mall . 
 On June 23 , 1998 , the city expanded when Lawton annexed neighboring Fort Sill . With the advent of the Base Realignment and Closure of 2005 increasing the size of Fort Sill , Lawton is expected to see continued population and economic growth over the course of the next 20 years .

 = Russian battleship Ioann Zlatoust = 
 Ioann Zlatoust ( Russian : <unk> <unk> ) was an Evstafi @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Russian Navy 's Black Sea Fleet . She was built before World War I and her completion was greatly delayed by changes made to reflect the lessons of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1905 . She was the second ship of her class . 
 She and her sister ship Evstafi were the most modern ships in the Black Sea Fleet when World War I began and formed the core of the fleet for the first year of the war , before the Imperatritsa Mariya @-@ class dreadnoughts entered service . Ioann Zlatoust and Evstafi forced the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben to disengage during the Battle of Cape Sarych shortly after Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire in late 1914 . She covered several bombardments of the Bosphorus fortifications in early 1915 , including one where she was attacked by the Goeben , but Ioann Zlatoust , together with the other Russian pre @-@ dreadnoughts , managed to drive her off . Ioann Zlatoust was relegated to secondary roles after the first dreadnought entered service in late 1915 and reduced to reserve in 1918 in Sevastopol . 
 Ioann Zlatoust was captured when the Germans took the city in May 1918 and was turned over to the Allies after the Armistice in November 1918 . Her engines were destroyed in 1919 by the British when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using the ship against the White guards . She was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and was scrapped by the Soviets in 1922 – 23 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Ioann Zlatoust was 379 feet ( 115 @.@ 5 m ) long at the waterline and 385 feet 9 inches ( 117 @.@ 6 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 74 feet ( 22 @.@ 6 m ) and a maximum draft of 28 ft ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) . Her displacement was 12 @,@ 855 long tons ( 13 @,@ 061 t ) as completed . 
 She had two 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines driving two propellers . 22 Belleville water @-@ tube boilers provided steam to the engines . The engines had a total designed output of 10 @,@ 600 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 904 kW ) and gave a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . At full load she carried 1 @,@ 100 long tons ( 1 @,@ 118 t ) of coal that provided her a range of 2 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 900 km ; 2 @,@ 400 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Ioann Zlatoust ran her propulsion trials on 26 July 1910 and reached a maximum speed of 16 @.@ 2 knots ( 30 @.@ 0 km / h ; 18 @.@ 6 mph ) and her engines produced a total of 10 @,@ 623 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 922 kW ) . The navy was not satisfied and ran another test on 11 August which revealed cracks in the port engine 's medium pressure cylinder . A final test was run on 29 November and the ship 's horsepower increased slightly to 10 @,@ 990 indicated horsepower ( 8 @,@ 200 kW ) . 
 Ioann Zlatoust 's Obukhovskii 12 @-@ inch Pattern 1895 40 @-@ calibre guns were mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft . Each turret had a firing arc of 260 ° . All four 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) 50 @-@ calibre Pattern 1905 guns were mounted in the corners of the superstructure in armoured casemates . These guns had a firing arc of 120 ° and could fire straight ahead or astern . The dozen 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) Canet Pattern 1892 45 @-@ calibre guns were mounted in the lower casemates . The anti @-@ torpedo boat armament consisted of 14 75 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) Canet Pattern 1892 50 @-@ calibre guns mounted in sponsons on the upper deck , protected by gun shields . She carried two 17 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 450 mm ) torpedo tubes on the broadside aft . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 Ioann Zlatoust was fitted with anti @-@ aircraft guns on top of each of her turrets during 1915 and screens were added on top of her funnels to keep out light bombs . She was initially received four 75 @-@ millimetre guns , but this was later altered to a pair of 75 mm guns and another pair of 63 @.@ 5 @-@ millimetre ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) guns . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Construction of Ioann Zlatoust began on 14 November 1903 , well before the formal keel @-@ laying ceremony on 13 November 1904 . Progress was relatively quick , despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution , and she was launched on 13 May 1906 . Fitting @-@ out , however , was considerably delayed by a number of changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo @-@ Japanese War . For example there was a period of seven months in 1907 where virtually no work was done on the ship and she was not completed until 1 April 1911 . Ioann Zlatoust 's turrets had originally been intended for a reconstruction of the elderly pre @-@ dreadnought Chesma , but they were diverted to Ioann Zlatoust after that reconstruction was cancelled . 
 Before the beginning of World War I the Black Sea Fleet experimented with concentrating fire from several ships under the control of a " master ship " . They had to be identically armed and were equipped with additional radio gear to transmit and receive range and deflection data . Ioann Zlatoust became the master ship for the Black Sea Fleet , working with Evstafi and Pantelimon . 
 Two weeks after the Russian declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire on 2 November 1914 , the Black Sea Fleet , comprising the pre @-@ dreadnoughts Evstafi , Ioann Zlatoust , Pantelimon , Rostislav , Tri Sviatitelia , and three cruisers were escorted by three destroyers and 11 torpedo boats set out on 15 November to bombard Trebizond . They did this successfully on the morning of 17 November and they turned west to hunt for Turkish shipping along the Anatolian coast before setting course for Sevastopol later that afternoon . They were intercepted by the German battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser SMS Breslau the following day in what came to be known as the Battle of Cape Sarych . Despite the noon hour the conditions were foggy and the capital ships initially did not spot each other . Evstafi was the lead ship , but held her fire until Ioann Zlatoust , the master ship , could see Goeben . When the gunnery commands were finally received they showed a range over 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) in excess of Evstafi 's own estimate of 7 @,@ 700 yards ( 7 @,@ 000 m ) , so Evstafi opened fire using her own data before Goeben turned to unmask its broadside . Evstafi scored a hit with her first salvo as a 12 @-@ inch shell partially penetrated the armour casemate protecting one of Goeben 's 15 @-@ centimetre ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) secondary guns . It detonated some of the ready @-@ use ammunition , starting a fire that burnt out the casemate and killed its crew . That was , however , the only hit on Goeben , although it caused her to disengage from the Russian squadron . Ioann Zlatoust merely fired six shells herself as only her forward turret could see Goeben . 
 On 9 January 1915 Breslau and the Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye encountered the Russian fleet while returning from a mission in the eastern part of the Black Sea . Breslau hit Evstafi 's forward turret , temporarily putting it out of action , and the two cruisers escaped using their superior speed . Evstafi and Ioann Zlatoust served as the covering force for several bombardment missions of the Bosphorus between 18 March and 9 May 1915 . The two earlier bombardments were uneventful , but the 9 May bombardment provoked a reaction as Goeben intercepted the Russian battleships after they had been spotted by the Ottoman destroyer Numune @-@ i Hamiyet . Both forces turned on parallel courses and opened fire at the range of 17 @,@ 400 yards ( 15 @,@ 900 m ) . Neither side scored a hit although Goeben had multiple near @-@ misses on Evstafi . Vice Admiral Andrei Eberhardt ordered his ships to make only 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 5 @.@ 8 mph ) while Goeben was making 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . Goeben was unable to cross the T of the Russian ships , despite its superior speed , as they were continually turning . This manoeuvre bought enough time that Tri Sviatitelia and Pantelimon were able to rejoin the other two ships before they could start shelling the Ottoman forts . Pantelimon hit Goeben twice before the German ship broke contact after 22 minutes of firing . With the fleet assembled Admiral Eberhardt attempted to pursue the enemy battlecruiser , but was unsuccessful . 
 On 1 August 1915 , Ioann Zlatoust and all the other pre @-@ dreadnoughts were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Brigade , after the dreadnought Imperatritsa Mariya entered service . On 1 October the new dreadnought provided cover while Ioann Zlatoust and Pantelimon bombarded Zonguldak and Evstafi shelled the nearby town of Kozlu . Both Evstafi @-@ class ships participated in the second bombardment of Varna in May 1916 . 
 Evstafi and Ioann Zlatoust were reduced to reserve in March 1918 in Sevastopol . Immobile , they were captured there by the Germans in May 1918 and handed over to the Allies the following December . The British wrecked both ships ' engines 22 – 24 April 1919 when they left the Crimea to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians . They were captured by both sides during the Russian Civil War , but were abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920 . The ships was scrapped in 1922 – 23 , although they were not struck from the Navy List until 21 November 1925 . 
 = Hurricane Nadine ( 2012 ) = 
 Hurricane Nadine was the fourth longest @-@ lived Atlantic hurricane on record . The fourteenth tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season , Nadine developed from a tropical wave west of Cape Verde on September 10 . By the following day , it had strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine . After initially tracking northwestward , Nadine turned northward , well away from any landmass . Early on September 15 , Nadine reached hurricane status as it was curving eastward . Thereafter , an increase in vertical wind shear weakened Nadine back to a tropical storm by September 16 . On the following day , the storm began moving northeastward and threatened the Azores ; by late on September 19 , however , Nadine veered east @-@ southeastward before reaching the islands . Nonetheless , the storm produced tropical storm force winds on a few islands . On September 21 , the storm curved south @-@ southeastward while located south of the Azores . Later that day , Nadine transitioned into a non @-@ tropical low pressure area . 
 Due to favorable conditions , the remnants of Nadine regenerated into a tropical cyclone on September 24 . After re @-@ developing , the storm executed a cyclonic loop and meandered slowly across the eastern Atlantic . Eventually , Nadine turned south @-@ southwestward , at which time it became nearly stationary . By September 28 , the storm curved northwestward and re @-@ strengthened into a hurricane . The tenacious cyclone intensified further and peaked with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) on September 30 . By the following day , however , Nadine weakened back to a 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) tropical storm , as conditions became increasingly unfavorable . Strong wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures significantly weakened the storm . Nadine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 3 , shortly before merging with an approaching cold front northeast of the Azores . The remnants of Nadine passed through the Azores on October 4 and again brought relatively strong winds to the islands .

 A large tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 7 . The system passed south of Cape Verde on September 8 , with disorganized showers and thunderstorms . Around that time , the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48 hours . A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September 9 , which caused convective activity to increase further . The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September 10 . Based on satellite intensity estimates , the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200 UTC on September 10 , while located about 885 miles ( 1 @,@ 425 km ) west of Cape Verde . 
 Although thunderstorm activity was initially minimal around the center of circulation , convective band associated with the depression was becoming more organized . Late on September 10 , convection began to increase slightly near the center , though because Dvorak intensity T @-@ numbers were between 2 @.@ 0 and 2 @.@ 5 , the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm . However , dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day . Initially , it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge . However , by September 11 , the depression re @-@ curved northwestward . Later that day , the depression began to regain deep convection . Geostationary satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000 UTC on September 12 . 
 = = = Strengthening and initial peak intensity = = = 
 By September 12 , a central dense overcast developed and due to favorable conditions , the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of rapid deepening . Intensification continued at a quicker albeit less than rapid rate on September 12 . Later that day , sustained winds reached 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . By early on September 13 , convective banding wrapped almost completely around the center and cloud tops reached temperatures as low as − 112 ° F ( − 80 ° C ) . However , because microwave satellite data could not determine if an eye had developed , Nadine 's intensity was held at 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) – just below the threshold of hurricane status . The National Hurricane Center noted that " the window for Nadine to strengthen may be closing " , citing computer model consensus of an increase in wind shear and little change in structure . The storm then began experiencing moderate southwesterly wind shear on September 13 , generated by a mid- to upper @-@ level trough and a shear axis located a few hundred miles to the west of Nadine . As a result , the storm struggled to develop an eye and the center became more difficult to locate . 
 Although the storm was disorganized , a scatterometer pass indicated tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 230 miles ( 370 km ) . The satellite appearance of Nadine became more ragged by September 14 . Despite this , the storm remained just below hurricane status , and the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of intensification if wind shear were to decrease within the next few days . Nadine turned northward on September 14 as it tracked along the periphery of a subtropical ridge . Shortly thereafter , a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission ( TRMM ) pass indicated that core convection began re @-@ organizing . However , because wind shear displaced the mid @-@ level circulation to the north of the low @-@ level circulation , Nadine was not upgraded to a hurricane . Because Nadine would approach colder sea surface temperatures , significant strengthening was considered unlikely . Due to an increase in satellite intensity estimates and re @-@ organization , Nadine was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800 UTC on September 14 . Six hours later , Nadine reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Satellite imagery indicated that a ragged eye feature was attempting to develop late on September 15 . 
 = = = Weakening and initial post @-@ tropical transition = = = 
 Late on September 15 , National Hurricane Center forecaster Robbie Berg noted that Nadine began " to look a little more ragged " , as microwave data observations noted shearing of deep convection to the northeast of the center . Late on September 16 , the eye became tilted and disappeared , convective bands began disorganizing , and the overall shower and thunderstorms activity waned since early that day . Nadine weakened back to a tropical storm on September 17 . Additionally , a trough in the area caused Nadine to acquire a less tropical satellite appearance on September 17 . 
 Dry air began impacting Nadine on September 17 , though outflow from the storm prevented significant weakening . Despite a large flare of deep convection over the northern semicircle , Nadine weakened slightly later that day . Further weakening occurred on the following day , after the burst in deep convection on September 17 deteriorated . Later on September 18 , most of the deep convection dissipated , with the strongest of the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity being located within a band located west and northwest of the center . 
 Nadine threatened the Azores while moving northeastward and then northward between September 18 and September 19 , though a blocking ridge prevented the storm from approaching further toward the islands . Its closest approach to the Azores was about 150 miles ( 240 km ) south @-@ southwest of Flores Island on September 19 . The storm then re @-@ curved east @-@ southeastward on September 20 , after the ridge weakened and the mid- to upper @-@ level trough deepened . By late on September 21 , much of the remaining deep convection was composed of only a ragged convective band with warming cloud tops . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center re @-@ classified Nadine as a subtropical storm at 2100 UTC on September 21 , mainly because it had a larger than average and asymmetrical wind field , as well as the development of an upper @-@ level low pressure area near the center . However , post @-@ season analysis concluded that Nadine degenerated into a non @-@ tropical low pressure area three hours earlier . 
 = = = Regeneration , peak intensity , and demise = = = 
 Early on September 22 , the National Hurricane Center noted that regeneration into a tropical cyclone was a distinct possibility . The remnant low pressure area soon moved over warmer seas and a low @-@ shear environment , causing deep convection to re @-@ develop . Thus , Nadine regenerated back into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on September 23 . Another blocking ridge over the Azores forced Nadine to move west @-@ northwestward on September 24 , causing it to execute a small cyclonic loop . Although winds increased to 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , the storm weakened again and decreased to a 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) tropical storm on September 25 . Despite this , satellite imagery indicated that Nadine developed an eye @-@ like feature . However , the National Hurricane Center later noted that it was a cloud @-@ free region near the center of the storm . By September 26 , Nadine curved south @-@ southwestward to southwestward around the southeastern portion of a mid- to upper @-@ level ridge located over the western Atlantic . 
 After minimal change in strength for several days , Nadine finally began to intensify on September 27 , due to sea surface temperatures warmer than 79 ° F ( 26 ° C ) . At 1200 UTC on September 28 , Nadine re @-@ strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Around the time , satellite imagery indicated that the storm re @-@ developed an eye feature . After becoming disorganized , the National Hurricane Center erroneously downgraded Nadine to a tropical storm on September 29 , before upgrading it to a hurricane again six hours later . Nadine had actually remained a hurricane and was intensifying further . Winds increased to 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) on September 30 , after the eye became more distinct . At 1200 UTC , the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 978 mbar ( 28 @.@ 9 inHg ) . 
 After peak intensity , Nadine began weakening once again and deteriorated to a tropical storm at 1200 UTC , on October 1 . Northwesterly winds began to increase on October 3 , after an upper @-@ level trough that was causing low wind shear moved eastward . A few hours later , the low @-@ level center became partially exposed , before becoming fully separated from the convection by 1500 UTC . Due to strong wind shear and cold sea surface temperatures , showers and thunderstorms rapidly diminished , and by late on October 3 , Nadine became devoid of any deep convection . At 0000 UTC on October 4 , Nadine transitioned into an extratropical low @-@ pressure area , while located about 195 miles ( 315 km ) southwest of the central Azores . The low rapidly moved northeastward , degenerated into a trough of low pressure , and was absorbed by a cold front later that day .

 Tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued on two separate occasions as Nadine approached the Azores . At 1000 UTC on September 18 , a tropical storm watch was issued for the islands of Flores and Corvo . Although the tropical storm watch was discontinued at 2100 UTC , a tropical storm warning was implemented at that time for the islands of Corvo , Faial , Flores , Graciosa , Pico , São Jorge , and Terceira . At 1500 UTC on September 19 , a tropical storm warning was also issued for São Miguel and Santa Maria . All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on September 21 . After re @-@ generating , Nadine posed a threat to the Azores again , and thus , a tropical storm watch was issued for the entire archipelago at 1500 UTC on October 1 . Nine hours later , 0000 UTC on the following day , the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning . After Nadine became extratropical , the warning was discontinued . On the storm 's second approach toward the Azores , schools were closed and flight were cancelled . 
 Late on September 20 , Flores reported a wind gust of 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) . A sustained wind speed of 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) and a gust up to 81 mph ( 130 km / h ) were reported at Horta on the island of Faial , as Nadine passed to the south on September 21 . During the second Azores impact on October 4 , the highest sustained wind speed reported was 38 mph ( 61 km / h ) on São Miguel , while the strongest gust was 87 mph ( 140 km / h ) at the Wind Power Plant on Santa Maria . On Pico Island , the pavement of the sports hall of the primary and secondary school in Lajes do Pico was destroyed . The remnants of Nadine produced a plume of moisture that dropped heavy rainfall over the United Kingdom , particularly in England and Wales , reaching 5 @.@ 12 in ( 130 mm ) at Ravensworth in the former . The rains flooded houses and disrupted roads and rails . 
 Nadine lasted a total of 24 days as a tropical , subtropical and post @-@ tropical cyclone , including 22 @.@ 25 days as a tropical system . This makes it the fourth longest @-@ lasting Atlantic tropical cyclone on record , only behind the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane at 28 days , Hurricane Ginger in 1971 at 27 @.@ 25 days , and Hurricane Inga in 1969 at 24 @.@ 75 days . When only counting time spent as a tropical storm or hurricane – 20 @.@ 75 days – Nadine is the third longest @-@ lasting , behind only Hurricane Ginger in 1971 and the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane . When Nadine was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800 UTC on September 14 , it marked the third @-@ earliest forming eighth hurricane , behind only an unnamed system in 1893 and Ophelia in 2005 .
