 = Museum of Contemporary Art , Chicago = 
 The Museum of Contemporary Art ( MCA ) Chicago is a contemporary art museum near Water Tower Place in downtown Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , United States . The museum , which was established in 1967 , is one of the world 's largest contemporary art venues . The museum 's collection is composed of thousands of objects of Post @-@ World War II visual art . The museum is run gallery @-@ style , with individually curated exhibitions throughout the year . Each exhibition may be composed of temporary loans , pieces from their permanent collection , or a combination of the two . 
 The museum has hosted several notable debut exhibitions including Frida Kahlo 's first U.S. exhibition and Jeff Koons ' first solo museum exhibition . Koons later presented an exhibit at the Museum that broke the museum 's attendance record . To date , the most attended exhibition has been the 2015 David Bowie Is exhibit , shattering previous records with over 193 @,@ 000 attendees . Its collection , which includes Jasper Johns , Andy Warhol , Cindy Sherman , Kara Walker , and Alexander Calder , contains historical samples of 1940s – 1970s late surrealism , pop art , minimalism , and conceptual art ; notable holdings 1980s postmodernism ; as well as contemporary painting , sculpture , photography , video , installation , and related media . The museum also presents dance , theater , music , and multidisciplinary arts . 
 The current location at 220 East Chicago Avenue is in the Streeterville neighborhood of the Near North Side community area . Josef Paul Kleihues designed the current building after the museum conducted a 12 @-@ month search , reviewing more than 200 nominations . The museum opened at its new location June 21 – 22 , 1996 , with a 24 @-@ hour event that drew more than 25 @,@ 000 visitors . The museum was originally located at 237 East Ontario Street , which was originally designed as a bakery . The current building is known for its signature staircase leading to an elevated ground floor , which has an atrium , the full glass @-@ walled east and west façades giving a direct view of the city and Lake Michigan . 
 = = History = = 
 The Museum of Contemporary Art ( MCA ) Chicago was created as the result of a 1964 meeting of 30 critics , collectors and dealers at the home of critic Doris Lane Butler to bring the long @-@ discussed idea of a museum of contemporary art to complement the city 's Art Institute of Chicago , according to a grand opening story in Time . It opened in fall 1967 in a small space at 237 East Ontario Street that had for a time served as the corporate offices of Playboy Enterprises . Its first director was Jan van der Marck . In 1970 he invited Wolf <unk> to make the Concrete Traffic sculpture in Chicago . 
 Initially , the museum was conceived primarily as a space for temporary exhibitions , in the German <unk> model . However , in 1974 , the museum began acquiring a permanent collection of contemporary art objects created after 1945 . The MCA expanded into adjacent buildings to increase gallery space ; and in 1977 , following a fundraising drive for its 10th anniversary , a three @-@ story neighboring townhouse was purchased , renovated , and connected to the museum . In 1978 , Gordon Matta @-@ Clark executed his final major project in the townhouse . In his work Circus Or The Caribbean Orange ( 1978 ) , Matta @-@ Clark made circle cuts in the walls and floors of the townhouse next @-@ door to the first museum . 
 In 1991 , the museum 's Board of Trustees contributed $ 37 million ( $ 64 @.@ 3 million today ) of the expected $ 55 million ( $ 95 @.@ 6 million ) construction costs for Chicago 's first new museum building in 65 years . Six of the board members were central to the fundraising as major donors : Jerome Stone ( chairman emeritus of Stone Container Corporation ) , Beatrice C. Mayer ( daughter of Sara Lee Corporation founder Nathan Cummings ) and family , Mrs. Edwin Lindy Bergman , the <unk> Harris ( president of <unk> Corporation ) and Irving Harris families , and Thomas and Frances Dittmer ( commodities ) . The Board of Trustees then weighed architectural proposals from six finalists : Emilio <unk> of New York ; Tadao Ando of Osaka , Japan ; Josef Paul Kleihues of Berlin ; Fumihiko Maki of Tokyo ; <unk> of Santa Monica , Calif . ; and Christian de <unk> of Paris . According to Chicago Tribune Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning architecture critic Blair Kamin , the list of contenders was controversial because no Chicago @-@ based architects were included as finalists despite the fact that prominent Chicago architects such as Helmut Jahn and Stanley Tigerman were among the 23 semi @-@ finalists . In fact , none of the finalists had made any prior structures in Chicago . The selection process , which started with 209 contenders , was based on professional qualifications , recent projects , and the ability to work closely with the staff of the aspiring museum . 
 In 1996 , the MCA opened its current museum at 220 East Chicago Avenue , which was the site of a former National Guard Armory between Lake Michigan and Michigan Avenue from 1907 until it was demolished in 1993 to make way for the MCA . The four @-@ story 220 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 20 @,@ 000 m2 ) building designed by Josef Paul Kleihues , which was five times larger than its predecessor , made the Museum of Contemporary Art ( MCA ) Chicago the largest institution devoted to contemporary art in the world . The physical structure is said to reference the modernism of Mies van der Rohe as well as the tradition of Chicago architecture . 
 = = Operation = = 
 The museum operates as a tax @-@ exempt non @-@ profit organization , and its exhibitions , programming , and operations are member @-@ supported and privately funded . It has a board of trustees consisting of four officers , 18 life trustees , and more than 40 trustees . The current board chair is King Harris . The museum also has a director , who oversees the MCA 's staff of about 100 . Madeleine <unk> replaced 10 @-@ year director Robert Fitzpatrick during the 2008 fiscal year in this capacity , and she is the MCA 's first female director . 
 The museum operates with three programming departments : curatorial , performance , and education . Peter Taub is the director of performance programs , Heidi <unk> is the Beatrice C. Mayer Director of Education , and Teresa <unk> de Guzman is the Chief Operating Officer . The curatorial staff consists of Chief Curator Michael Darling , Curator Naomi Beckwith , Curator Lynne Warren , and Associate Curator Julie Rodrigues <unk> . In 2009 , the museum reported $ 17 @.@ 5 million in both operating income , 50 % of which came from contributions , and operating expenses . Contributions were received from individuals , corporations , foundations , government entities , and fundraising . 
 The museum is closed Mondays . While the museum has no mandatory admission charge and operates with a suggested admission ( $ 12 general , $ 7 students and seniors , free for MCA members , members of the military , and children 12 and under ) , it currently provides free admission every Tuesday , when it has extended hours of operation from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. During the summers , the museum provides free outdoor Tuesday Jazz concerts . On the first Friday of most months , the museum hosts First Fridays , which is an event featuring local DJs , artists , and other activities . In addition to art exhibits , the museum offers dance , theater , music , and multidisciplinary arts . The programming includes primary projects and festivals of a broad spectrum of artists presented in performance , discussion , and workshop formats .

 In its first year of operation , the museum hosted the exhibitions , Pictures To Be Read / Poetry To Be Seen , Claes Oldenburg : Projects for Monuments , and Dan Flavin : Pink and Gold , which was the artist 's first solo show . In 1969 , the museum served as the site of Christo 's first building wrap in the United States . It was wrapped in more than 8 @,@ 000 square feet ( 700 m ² ) of tarpaulin and rope . The following year it hosted one @-@ person shows for Roy Lichtenstein , Robert Rauschenberg , and Andy Warhol . 
 The MCA has also played host to the first American and solo exhibitions of prominent artists such as Frida Kahlo in 1978 . Other exhibition highlights include the first solo museum shows of Dan Flavin , in 1967 , and Jeff Koons , in 1988 . In 1989 , the MCA hosted Robert Mapplethorpe , The Perfect Moment , a traveling exhibition organized by the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia . This exhibition set a record for the highest attendance in the institution 's history . Additional highlights of exhibitions organized or co @-@ organized by the MCA include :

 In 2006 , the MCA was the only American museum to host Bruce Mau 's Massive Change exhibit , which concerned the social , economic , and political effects of design . Additional 2006 exhibitions featured photographers Catherine Opie and Wolfgang Tillmans as well as Chicago @-@ based cartoonist Chris Ware . The 2008 Koons retrospective broke the attendance record with 86 @,@ 584 visitors for the May 31 – September 21 , 2008 show . This was the culminating exhibit of the 2008 fiscal year , which celebrated the 40th anniversary of the museum . 
 In 2009 , the MCA presented Jeremy Deller 's exhibition It Is What It Is : Conversations About Iraq . The exhibition was organized by the New Museum , and it was a new commission by the New Museum , New York ; the Museum of Contemporary Art , Chicago ; and the Hammer Museum , Los Angeles . 
 Co @-@ organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the <unk> Center for the Arts , the MCA presented Luc <unk> from October 2010 – January 2011 . Susan Philipsz : We Shall Be All was presented at the MCA February – June , 2011 . The Turner Prize @-@ winning artist 's sound exhibition featured protest songs and drew from Chicago 's labor history . The exhibition Eiko & Koma : Time is Not Even , Space is Not Empty is the first series of stage performances and a gallery exhibition presented at the MCA . The Japanese @-@ born choreographers and dance artists perform and exhibit at the MCA June – November , 2011 .

 After a 10 @-@ year run , the exhibition series UBS 12x12 : New Artists / New Work is moving from the second floor to the third floor , into a larger gallery space and will change its name to " Chicago Works . " The exhibition series will still feature Chicago @-@ area artists . Rather than each artist being displayed for one month , each exhibition in the series will now be displayed for three months . 
 Starting in 2002 , the MCA began commissioning artists and architects to design and construct public art for the front plaza . The goal of the program is to link the museum to its neighboring community by extending its programmatic , educational , and outreach functions . While artists have been exhibited intermittently on the MCA plaza since 2002 , the summer 2011 plaza exhibit showcasing four works by Miami @-@ based sculptor Mark Handforth marks a revitalization of the plaza project . 
 From October through May , the MCA hosts monthly Family Days , which feature artistic activities for all ages . Each summer , the museum hosts Tuesdays on the Terrace , a jazz performance series ; Summer Studios , designed for families to experience the creative process ; and a Farmers Market on the MCA plaza on Tuesdays from June through October .

 In 2011 , the MCA celebrated its 15th anniversary of the MCA Stage . The MCA Stage has featured local , national , and international theater , dance , music , multimedia , and film performances in its 15 @-@ year history . It is known as the " most active interdisciplinary arts presenter in Chicago " and partners with local community organizations for the co @-@ presentations of performing arts . 
 Notable past stage appearances include performances by Trisha Brown Dance Company , Abbey Theatre of Ireland , Olafur <unk> , and Elevator Repair Service . 
 = = New structure = = 
 The new five @-@ storey limestone and cast @-@ aluminum structure was designed by Berlin architect Josef Paul Kleihues . The building , which opened in 1996 , contains 45 @,@ 000 square feet ( 4 @,@ 200 m2 ) of gallery space ( seven times the space of the old museum ) , a theater , studio @-@ classrooms , an education center , a museum store , a restaurant @-@ café , and a sculpture garden . The MCA building was Kleihues 's first American structure . Its construction cost US $ 46 @.@ 5 million ( $ 70 @.@ 2 million today ) . The sculpture garden , which is 34 @,@ 000 square feet ( 3 @,@ 200 m2 ) , includes a sculptural installation by Sol <unk> and sculptures by George Rickey and Jane <unk> . The floor plan of both the building and the sculpture garden is a square , on which the proportions of the building is based . 
 The building 's main entrance , which is accessed by scaling 32 steps , uses both symmetry and transparency as themes for its large central glass walls that compose the majority of both the east and west façades of the building . Two additional entrances — into the education center and into the museum store — are located on either side of the main staircase . The monumental staircase with projecting bays and plinths that may be used as the base for sculpture is reminiscent of the <unk> of the Acropolis in Athens . The main level entry hall has an adjacent 55 @-@ foot ( 16 @.@ 8 m ) atrium that connects it to a restaurant in the rear of the building . Two galleries for temporary exhibitions flank the atrium . The stairwell in the northwest corner is often cited as the buildings most interesting and dynamic artistic feature . The elevated views of Lake Michigan are considered to be a rewarding feature of the building . The building 's 56 @-@ foot ( 17 @.@ 1 m ) glass facade sits atop 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) of Indiana limestone . The building is known for its hand @-@ cast aluminum panels adjoined to the facade with stainless steel buttons . The building has two two @-@ story gallery spaces and a smaller one @-@ story gallery space on the second floor . The third floor has a gallery and exhibition space in its northwest section , and the fourth floor has two large galleries , an exhibition space on the west side of the building , and a gallery in the southwest section . 
 The museum has a 296 @-@ seat multi @-@ use theater with a proscenium @-@ layout stage . The seats are laid out in 14 rows with two side aisles . The stage is 52 by 34 feet ( 16 m × 10 m ) and elevated 36 inches ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) above the floor level of the first row of seats . The house has a 12 degree incline . The stage has three curtains and four catwalks . 
 = = = Critical review = = = 
 Complaining that the structure has a more fortress @-@ like exterior than its predecessor , Kamin viewed the architectural attempt as a fumbled work . However , he considered the interior to be serene and contemplative in a manner that complements the contemporary art and compact and organized in a manner that is an improvement on the more traditional mazelike museums . Comparing the building to the Sullivan Center and the Art Institute of Chicago Building , Kamin describes the museum as an homage to two of Chicago 's architectural influences : Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Louis Sullivan . Other critics also note the presence of Mies van der Rohe 's spirit in the architecture . 
 Chicago @-@ based architect Douglas Garofalo has described the building as stark , intimidating and " incongruous with contemporary sensibilities " . The interior atrium , which the architect claims links the city to the lake is part of a transcendent space that benefits from the sunlight that enters through the high glass walls . The building is said to be designed to separate the art from other distracting services and functions of the venue . Kamin was also pleased with the separate entrances on the main floor for the museum store and accessibility entrances . 
 = = New Vision = = 
 Announced by the Chicago Tribune in June 2011 , the MCA is in the process of reinventing its identity with new curators , a new floor plan , and a new vision . MCA Director Madeleine <unk> says the museum seeks to be 50 / 50 artist @-@ activated / audience @-@ engaged . The main floor 's north and south galleries will present exhibitions showcasing the museum 's permanent collection and work by post @-@ emerging contemporary artists . The third floor will be for the " Chicago Works " series . The fourth floor will have gallery spaces for the MCA Screen and MCA DNA series , while the main barrel @-@ vaulted galleries will be for special exhibitions . 
 = = Collection = = 
 The museum 's collection consists of about 2 @,@ 700 objects , as well as more than 3 @,@ 000 artist 's books . The collection includes works of art from 1945 to the present . 
 Former MCA Chief Curator Elizabeth Smith provided a narrative of the museum 's collection . She says the collection has examples of late surrealism , pop art , minimalism , and conceptual art from the 1940s through the 1970s ; work from the 1980s that can be grouped under postmodernism ; and painting , sculpture , photography , video , installation , and related media current artists explore .

 = Fantastic Universe = 
 Fantastic Universe was a U.S. science fiction magazine which began publishing in the 1950s . It ran for 69 issues , from June 1953 to March 1960 , under two different publishers . It was part of the explosion of science fiction magazine publishing in the 1950s in the United States , and was moderately successful , outlasting almost all of its competitors . The main editors were Leo Margulies ( 1954 – 1956 ) and Hans Stefan Santesson ( 1956 – 1960 ) ; under Santesson 's tenure the quality declined somewhat , and the magazine became known for printing much UFO @-@ related material . A collection of stories from the magazine , edited by Santesson , appeared in 1960 from Prentice @-@ Hall , titled The Fantastic Universe Omnibus . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The early 1950s saw dramatic changes in the world of U.S. science fiction publishing . At the start of 1949 , all but one of the major magazines in the field were in pulp format ; by the end of 1955 , all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format . This change was largely the work of the distributors , such as American News Company , who refused to carry the pulp magazines since they were no longer profitable ; the loss of profitability was in turn associated with the rise in mass @-@ market science fiction publishing , with paperback publishers such as Ace Books and Ballantine Books becoming established . Along with the increase in science fiction in book form came a flood of new U.S. magazines : from a low of eight active magazines in 1946 , the field expanded to twenty in 1950 , and a further twenty @-@ two had commenced publication by 1954 . 
 Fantastic Universe published its first issue in the midst of this publishing boom . The issue , in digest format , was dated June – July 1953 , and was priced at 50 cents . This was higher than any of its competition , but it also had the highest page count in the field at the time , with 196 pages . The initial editorial team was Leo Margulies as publisher , and Sam Merwin as editor ; this was a combination familiar to science fiction fans from their years together at Thrilling Wonder Stories , which Merwin edited from 1945 to 1951 . The publisher , King @-@ Size Publications , also produced The Saint Detective Magazine , which was popular , so Fantastic Universe enjoyed good distribution from the start — a key factor in a magazine 's success . The first issue included stories by Arthur C. Clarke , Philip K. Dick , and Ray Bradbury . According to Donald Tuck , the author of an early SF encyclopaedia , the magazine kept a fairly high quality through Merwin 's departure after a year , and through the subsequent brief period of caretaker editorship by Beatrice Jones . Margulies took over the editor 's post with the May 1954 issue . 
 In October 1955 , Hans Stefan Santesson , an American writer , editor , and reviewer , began contributing " Universe in Books " , the regular book review column . A year later , with the September 1956 issue , Santesson took over from Margulies as editor . One immediate change was an increase in the number of articles about UFOs . Santesson ran several articles by Ivan T. Sanderson , among others , including articles on auras and on the abominable snowman . However , he also ran polemical articles opposed to the UFO mania , including strongly worded pieces by Lester del Rey and C.M. Kornbluth . Del Rey , at least , felt that Santesson was not a believer in UFOs : " So far as I could determine , <unk> [ sic ] was skeptical about such things , but felt that all sides deserved a hearing and also that the controversies were good for circulation . " 
 The quality of the fiction is thought by Donald Tuck to have generally fallen during Santesson 's period at the helm , though this was not entirely his fault — there were a great many other magazines competing for stories by the top writers . Santesson himself , despite a modicum of controversy over his heavy use of UFO and related material , was kind and helpful to writers , and was well liked as a result . 
 In late 1959 the magazine was sold to Great American Publications , and it was significantly redesigned . The size was increased to that of a glossy magazine , although the magazine was still bound rather than saddle @-@ stapled . Under King @-@ Size Publications , the magazine had had no artwork except small " filler " illustrations ; now interior illustrations complementing the stories were introduced , and photographs and diagrams accompanied some of the articles . A fan column , by Belle C. Dietz , began , and Sam Moskowitz wrote two detailed historical articles about proto @-@ sf . However , the March 1960 issue was the last one . Fredric Brown 's " The Mind Thing " had begun serialization in that issue ; it was eventually published in book form later that year . 
 Circulation figures for Fantastic Universe are unknown , since at that time circulation figures were not required to be published annually , as they were later . After the magazine folded , the publisher entertained plans to publish material bought for the magazine as a one @-@ shot issue to be titled " Summer SF " ; however , the issue never appeared . Santesson did later edit an anthology drawn from the magazine , titled The Fantastic Universe Omnibus . 
 = = Contents = = 
 Fantastic Universe published several significant stories during its seven @-@ year history . These included stories from Tales of Conan , a collection of four Robert E. Howard stories rewritten as Conan stories by L. Sprague de Camp . Three of the stories were published in Fantastic Universe , two before the book , and one after : 
 " Hawks Over Shem " ( October 1955 ) 
 " The Road of the Eagles " ( as " Conan , Man of Destiny " , December 1955 ) 
 " The Blood @-@ Stained God " ( April 1956 ) 
 Other notable and widely reprinted stories included : 
 " Short in the Chest " , by Margaret St. Clair ( writing as Idris Seabright , July 1954 ) . 
 " Who ? " , by Algis Budrys ( April 1955 ) . Formed the basis for Budrys 's novel , Who ? 
 " The Minority Report " , by Philip K. Dick ( January 1956 ) . The basis for the movie Minority Report . 
 " First Law " , by Isaac Asimov ( October 1956 ) . One of Asimov 's robot stories . 
 " <unk> <unk> " , by John Brunner ( December 1959 ) . Formed the basis of Brunner 's novel The Whole Man . 
 " The Large Ant " , by Howard Fast ( February 1960 ) . 
 Other writers who appeared in the magazine included Harlan Ellison , Theodore Sturgeon , Robert Silverberg , Clifford Simak , Robert F. Young , and Robert Bloch . 
 One offbeat feature of the magazine was the habit of including very short ( less than a page ) vignettes of fiction , usually but not always relating to the cover , without credit . These were most probably the work of the editor in many cases , though Frank Belknap Long wrote several of these for the inside front cover of the magazine . There was never a letter column , though in the very last issue there was a note that one was planned for future issues . The book review column , always titled " Universe in Books " , appeared fairly regularly but was liable to be dropped if there was no room for it . It was originally signed " The Editor " , and was presumably written by Sam Merwin ; Robert Frazier took the column on when Merwin left at the end of 1953 . Santesson took over in October 1955 and wrote every column that appeared from that point on . After the first few issues , which contained editorial essays from both editor and publisher , the editorials disappeared , though Santesson did sometimes fill a blank space with a few editorial comments . 
 Two articles by Moskowitz in the last few months of the magazine , " Two Thousand Years of Space Travel " , and " To Mars and Venus in the Gay Nineties " , were unusually early and well @-@ researched articles on proto @-@ science fiction . A couple of other non @-@ fiction articles appeared late on , but with the exception of UFO @-@ related material , and occasional filler paragraphs reporting science news , Fantastic Universe did not generally run science @-@ related articles . 
 = = Bibliographic details = = 
 The magazine began as a fat 196 @-@ page digest , priced at 50 cents , but this experiment did not last . The fourth issue , January 1954 , cut the price to 35 cents , and it stayed at that price for the rest of its life . The page count also dropped , to 164 pages with the fourth issue , then to 132 pages with the eighth issue , September 1954 . The page count stayed at 132 through the rest of the digest period , and for the first five issues of the " glossy " period under the new publisher . The very last issue cut the page count to 100 pages . 
 The magazine was initially bimonthly . The first three issues were named with two months : " June – July 1953 " , and so on . At the end of 1953 the naming was changed to the odd numbered months ; and then after January , March , May , and July , the magazine went monthly , starting with the September 1954 issue . This lasted without a break until the November 1958 issue . Another bimonthly schedule , starting with January 1959 , followed ; the last King @-@ Size Publications issue was September 1959 , and it was followed by an October 1959 issue from Great American . The remaining five issues followed a regular monthly schedule ; the last issue was March 1960 . The volume numbering scheme was fairly regular ; the first five volumes had six numbers each . Volume 6 had only five numbers , in order to get the new volume 7 to start with the new year , in 1957 . This lasted until volume 10 was cut short at five numbers when the magazine returned to a bimonthly schedule at the end of 1958 . Volume 11 had six numbers ; volume 12 had five . 
 The editors were : 
 June – July 1953 to October – November 1953 : Sam Merwin , Jr . ( 3 issues ) 
 January 1954 to March 1954 : Beatrice Jones ( 2 issues ) 
 May 1954 to August 1956 : Leo Margulies ( 26 issues ) 
 September 1956 to March 1960 : Hans Stefan Santesson ( 38 issues ) 
 Cover art was initially mostly by Alex Schomburg . Other artists , including Ed Emshwiller , Kelly Freas , and Mel Hunter , contributed covers ; and towards the end there was a long sequence of covers by Virgil Finlay . Finlay also contributed much of the interior art in the last six issues ; generally Great American did not credit the artists , but along with Finlay , Emshwiller and John Giunta were featured . 
 = School Days ( visual novel ) = 
 School Days ( <unk> , <unk> Deizu ) is a Japanese visual novel developed by 0verflow , released on April 28 , 2005 for Windows as an adult game . It was later ported as a DVD game and for the PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) and PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) . The story , a dramatic slice @-@ of @-@ life , follows Makoto Ito , a high school student who becomes the ambivalent love @-@ interest of several girls during his second term , and the effects this has on himself and his relationships with other characters . Though the game requires little interaction from users , School Days engages the player through a plot that they are given opportunities to change the course of during play . The game concludes with an ending specific to the outcome of the story , some of which became notorious for their graphic violence . 
 0verflow announced work on School Days in October 2004 and marketed it through public venues that showcased the game 's innovative use of anime @-@ like cinematics and voice . The game ranked as the best @-@ selling visual novel in Japan for the time of its release , continuing to chart in the national top 50 for nearly five months afterward . 0verflow would then go on to produce multiple sequels including a spin @-@ off of the original story called Summer Days , and a parallel story called Cross Days . Another spin @-@ off , Island Days , has been developed by Klon for the Nintendo 3DS . School Days was remastered as School Days HQ on October 8 , 2010 and localized in North America on June 27 , 2012 . The original game was officially discontinued April 21 , 2011 . 
 Following the game 's release , School Days made several transitions into other media . The original story was adapted into a manga and serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten magazine Comp Ace ; it was later published into two volumes . Comic anthologies , light novels and art books were also published , as were audio dramas and several albums of music . An animated television series , two direct @-@ to @-@ video ( OVA ) single releases , and a concert film were also produced , the first of which became a precursor for an internet meme when its finale was pulled from broadcast . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 As a visual novel , School Days contains extremely minimal gameplay . The game 's core onscreen presentation is composed of scenes that are viewed from a mostly third @-@ person perspective . At predetermined intervals , the game pauses , and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make , or not make , on behalf of characters . Each selection branches the game 's progress up to that point in an alternate direction , while also causing the player 's love toward a character to blossom , plateau , or diminish , thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience . Being an erotic title , relationships between characters may become sexual ; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing , masturbation , oral sex and intercourse . Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases , but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored . Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game . 
 Each route the game takes invariably concludes with an ending specific to the choices made up to that point . Depending on these choices , the outcome of the story will either be good or bad . School Days became popularly known for its bad endings , which depict the deaths of characters . In one ending titled " The Bloody Conclusion " , a character 's neck is slit open with a <unk> , causing her to collapse and die in a fountain of blood to the manic laughter of her assailant . In another called " Eternally " , a character commits suicide leaning over and falling off the roof of a school , landing headfirst on a sidewalk to the horror of other characters . The game 's good endings , by contrast , depict the well @-@ being of characters and their relationships . In the ending " Christmas Eve " , a couple share an embrace in a hotel room as snow falls around a surrounding cityscape . In another titled " Two Lovers " , a pair of characters agree to have a polyamorous relationship with the male lead instead of rivaling with each other . Because of the numerous alternate endings that can be achieved , players who wish to watch additional endings and sex scenes will have to play through the game more than once . 
 Unlike traditional visual novels that consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue , School Days is unusual in that it incorporates motion and voice , making it reminiscent of an animated series . <unk> naturally play on their own , and players are afforded the ability to pause , fast @-@ forward , and even skip those they 've seen before . Male and female voices can be muted , subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a window or fullscreen ratio . Progress can be saved at any time in up to 100 slots and loaded from either the main menu or during play .

 School Days was 0verflow 's tenth game to develop . News of School Days first surfaced on October 5 , 2004 when 0verflow posted a link to the game 's then @-@ live website and development log on their official site . In the blog , 0verflow revealed that School Days had been in pre @-@ production for roughly two years and would be a fully animated game . Updates on the development of the game were scheduled for Tuesdays and Fridays , and the company encouraged fans to attend Dream Party 2004 , an upcoming anime convention at Tokyo Big Sight in Ariake , on October 11 , where it would make its first public showcase of the game and characters .

 Promotion for the game began shortly after . In a November 6 development post , 0verflow announced that it was planning a public screening of new game material , but was experiencing difficulty acquiring space for it . The company had initially chosen to have the venue in Akihabara but was unable to find a retailer willing to host it , prompting a visit to Osaka the following week . News that the game would contain music by artists such as Minami Kuribayashi , Haruko Momoi , <unk> * and YURIA was posted on November 30 , along with a release date change to February 25 , 2005 .

 = Russkiy Toy = 
 The Russian Toy ( also known as the Russian Toy Terrier , and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy , Russian : <unk> <unk> ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier . There are two types coats in the breed : smooth coat and long coat . The smooth coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier . Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the " Terrier " was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008 , allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010 . The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia . 
 The breed was nearly wiped out twice ; first in the 1920s with the rise of Communism due to the toy dog 's traditional link to the aristocracy and again in the 1990s with the influx of foreign breeds following the fall of the Iron Curtain . The smooth coat type is the older of the two , with the long coat type first appearing in 1958 . 
 Until the 1990s , the breed was almost unknown outside of Russia , and so relatively few details on associated health issues are known . The Russian Toy was originally bred as a rat fighter and as a watchdog , and can still exhibit the vocalization expected from the latter . It is a friendly dog and can become very attached to the family unit . Due to its size and similarities to the chihuahua , the two are often compared . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Russian Toy is one of the smallest breeds in the world , measuring between 20 cm and 28 cm and weighing anywhere between 1 kg and 3 kg . It has a small distinctive head with large eyes and triangular ears . In countries where docking is prohibited , the tail is curved in the shape of a sickle . There are two types in the breed , distinguished by their coats ; one is long coated and the other smooth coated . The smooth coated dog has a short , shiny , close @-@ lying coat . The long coated variety has a longer coat and profuse feathering in the ears , legs and tail . The feathering or " fringe " on the ears is usually 3 to 5 cm long , can be straight or with a slight wave . It will be grown by the age of three and should completely cover the outer edges and tips of the ears . 
 The smooth coat type of the breed closely resembles the Pražský <unk> breed of the Czech Republic . The Pražský on average is a little shorter on leg and a little heavier than the Russian Toy . 
 Both of the Russian Toy varieties can be crossed and produce smooth and long coated puppies from the same litter . In addition , when two smooth coated dogs are bred together , they may occasionally bear a long coated offspring if the long hair gene is present in their pedigrees . However , there have been no records of two long coated Russian Toys breeding together and producing smooth coated offspring . 
 The breed has four main colors : black and tan , blue and tan , brown and tan , solid red of various shades . Red includes sable ( red where the tips of the hairs are black , known as overlay ) and red sable ( red with brown overlay ) . 
 = = Health = = 
 A Russian Toy will often require the help of a veterinarian to remove any retained deciduous teeth ( known as " puppy teeth " or " baby teeth " ) that fail to fall out and make way for the permanent teeth . Without this intervention , usually done under anesthetic , the baby and permanent teeth will occupy the same socket in the jaw , which can cause tartar deposits , tooth decay , gingivitis and periodontitis , and can lead to premature loss of teeth . Retained puppy teeth can also cause misalignment of the teeth . 
 As with most breeds of dog , the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation , which is where the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that normally holds it in place is too shallow . It is usually an inherited defect , which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma . 
 Russian Toys can suffer from bone fractures due to their small and sometimes delicate nature . 
 = = Temperament = = 
 Active and cheerful , the Russian Toy was originally bred both as an anti @-@ rat dog and a watch dog . The second quality is still active in the breed , and they can be very vocal . They can become quite attached to their family , regardless of the ages of the family members . Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers , but very loyal to their owners , always ready to protect them from any perceived danger . 
 = = History = = 
 The first evidence of English style terriers in Russia can be seen in the Museum of Zoology in Saint Petersburg . On display is an English style terrier dated 1716 – 1726 with a sign that reads " This dog is a short hair terrier named <unk> . It personally belonged to the Russian Emperor Peter the Great . " Indeed , the breed was developed as a companion dog for Russian nobility . According to some accounts , records indicate that eight smooth coated Russian Toys competed in a dog show in St. Petersburg as far back as 1874 . The more generally accepted first reference to the breed appears in May 1907 when 11 Russian Toys were shown at an exhibition in St. Petersburg . In 1923 , two dogs appeared at a Moscow dog show and in 1924 , three more were awarded medals at a show in Odessa . But as a result of the October Revolution , the Russian Toy diminished in popularity and in numbers as these types of dogs were closely linked to the aristocracy and therefore frowned upon . In 1947 , only one dog was shown in St. Petersburg . When breeding began to revitalize the stock of Russian Toys in Russia , only a few of the dogs left had pedigrees or were purebred . 
 The lack of numbers and political isolation of the country at the time caused the creation of a new breed quite distinct from the former English style toy dog as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed . The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most of the features of the classic toy terrier , with the addition of some new characteristics . The head is high but not wide , the cheeks are flat and the eyes are round . By 1960 , 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the first standard for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture . 
 In 1988 , the Russian <unk> Federation published a new breed standard , combining the short coated Russian Toy Terrier and the long coated Moscow Toy Terrier under " Russian Toy Terrier . " However , after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 , the popularity of imported exotic breeds nearly drove the Russian Toy into extinction . A resurgence occurred thanks to a new energetic generation of dog breeders , but the breed remained virtually unknown outside of Russia until the 1990s . Several kennels have now been established outside Russia , the most successful ones located in Finland , Estonia , Belarus , Ukraine and Czech Republic . Interest in the breed is on the rise in the USA and Japan . 
 The Russian Toy was provisionally recognised by the Federation Cynologique Internationale in 2006 and is expected to gain definitive recognition in 2016 . 
 The United Kennel Club and The Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club both accepted the breed in 2008 
 Russian Toys are also recognized by the American Rare Breed Association and International All Breed Canine Association . 
 = = = Development of the long coated Russian Toy = = = 
 The original long coated Russian Toy is arguably a dog named Chikki born on 12 October 1958 to two smooth coated dogs that both had slightly longer hair than was typical . Initially , the puppy was not to be registered as its coat was too long meet the breed standard , and usually such dogs would not participate in breeding programs and would often be put down . Chikki , however , was registered with a pedigree and purchased by Evgeniya <unk> Zharova . Zharova is thus the long coated variety 's founding breeder as the first breeder to intentionally retain and breed a dog with a longer coat . Chikki developed an ear fringe and was mated with a female named Irma , who also had a longer coat than most smooth coated dogs , and together they produced a litter of three long coated puppies . Zharova developed the breed in Moscow , and so it came to be known as the Moscow Toy Terrier . The breed made its first appearance at a dog show in 1964 and the standard was set in 1966 . Ten years after Chikki 's birth , between 1968 and 1969 , approximately 300 long coated dogs were registered - a significant amount considering that Russian Toy litters tend to be small , typically one to three puppies . Today , the long coated variety has an established presence in Poland , Czech Republic , Estonia , Ukraine and a number of other countries , but the breeding program is particularly strong in Finland . 
 The first Russian Toy was brought to Finland in 1988 when a long coated male named Black @-@ Champion @-@ Bonaparte was imported from Russia and registered by <unk> Lehtinen under Kennel Jojamint 's . A female named Ste @-@ <unk> was brought later that same year from Estonia by the same owner , and the two produced Finland 's first Russian Toy litter ( Jojamint 's Agostini and Jojamint 's Alboreto ) also in 1988 . Black @-@ Champion @-@ Bonaparte and Ste @-@ <unk> were the first Russian Toys to appear in a dog show in Finland in 1989 .

 The Foundation Stock Service ( FSS ) of the American Kennel Club ( AKC ) accepted the Russian Toy into its records in August 2008 , and in July 2009 , the Russian Toy was approved to compete in AKC companion events from 1 January 2010 onwards . Russian Toys can also be shown and earn Certificate of Merit Points at FSS Open shows . 
 In 2008 , the AKC board and FSS also acknowledged the Russian Toy Club of America ( <unk> ) . The following year , the AKC board and FSS acknowledged Russian Toy Dog Club of America , Inc . ( RTDCA ) . 
 In 2010 this second club , RTDCA , decided to become the National Club for the Russian Toy breed in the United Kennel Club ( UKC ) , where it became known as the Russkiy Toy Dog Club of America , Inc . ( RTDCA ) . In 2013 , the RTDCA was asked by AKC to separate into two distinct clubs with different officers to form two independent clubs : one to represent the AKC club and the other to represent the UKC Club . The AKC Russian Toy Dog Club of America added the word " The " to their name and became The Russian Toy Dog Club of America ( <unk> ) while the UKC club retained the original Russkiy Toy Dog Club of America name ( RTDCA ) . 
 In August 2013 , AKC stated that the two clubs <unk> and <unk> must combine into one club to represent the Russian Toy breed in the AKC .

 " Agua Mala " is the thirteenth episode of the sixth season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on February 21 , 1999 in the United States . The episode was written by David Amann , and directed by Rob Bowman . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Agua Mala " earned a Nielsen household rating of 10 @.@ 1 , being watched by 16 @.@ 9 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mostly mixed to negative reviews . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files .

In this episode , Arthur Dales , now living in a Florida trailer park , calls Mulder and Scully for help when a neighboring family disappears ; and , with a hurricane approaching , Mulder and Scully find themselves trapped with a group of residents in a building where there is something in the water . 
 " Agua Mala " was Amann 's second story for The X @-@ Files . The original idea for the episode featured a monster loose in an abandoned gold mine . Darren McGavin makes a second appearance as Arthur Dales after being introduced in " Travelers . " After suffering a stroke , he would later be replaced by M. Emmet Walsh in " The Unnatural . " The episode was notable for its sheer amount of water and its lack of bright lighting , a stylistic approach that Gillian Anderson likened to filming in Vancouver .

Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection . Vincent refuses but , after being attacked by the creature in his apartment , relents . Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven from the bottom of the sea by the hurricane into the city 's water system . 
 Dougie steals the deputy 's wedding ring and knocks over a container of Epsom salts into the tub where the unconscious Greer is soaking after Scully removed several specimens from his neck wounds . While Angela Villareal relieves herself , she spots the creature in the tub with the deputy . Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone . Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water but is a living form of water , becoming visible only when it attacks . He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce , with the body 's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures . Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate . 
 Charging outside , Mulder is attacked by the creature in the hall . When he returns with the welts all over his throat , George Vincent slams the door and takes them all hostage , leaving Mulder to die in the hallway . Angela goes into labor and Scully finds herself forced to deliver a baby . However , water collects in the light fixture above them and the creature appears . It grabs George Vincent by the neck . Scully tells Walter Suarez to aim for the sprinklers , realizing that the freshwater kept the creature at bay , as with the deputy until Epsom salt was added to the water . Suarez shoots the sprinklers and saves Vincent 's life . Meanwhile , Mulder realizes that freshwater is the key also , and runs out into the rain to heal his wounds . 
 The next morning , the creature has vanished , the newborn baby has survived and is healthy , and Mulder starts recovering quite well . After telling the story to Dales , he is relieved and felt that he would have not retired from the FBI if he had a partner like Scully . He decides to celebrate with the agents now that the storm is over ; he asks them if they would like some water , to which they quickly reply " No ! "

 " Agua Mala " was written by David Amann and was his second story for The X @-@ Files after " Terms of Endearment . " " Agua Mala " went through several very different drafts . Amann was originally tasked with bringing back the character of Arthur Dales . His original story was of a monster loose in an abandoned gold mine . Frank Spotnitz , the show 's executive producer , did not particularly like the idea of a gold mine , but he enjoyed the concept of a monster loose in an enclosed space . Amann quickly decided to set the episode during a hurricane and feature a sea monster as the primary antagonist . Originally , the sea monster was blown onto dry land and crawled into the building , before Amann decided to re @-@ write it as living water . 
 Director Rob Bowman was worried that the episode 's monster would not appear " scary " and that the story would not be " compelling " . By utilizing unique camera angles and quick action Bowman was able to make the episode feel " a hell of a lot better than [ he ] was afraid it might " . The monster was created by special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich , a task he considered " the single most difficult thing [ he ] did all season " . The tentacles were created out of a combination of silicone and urethane to make them translucent , but give them a flexible feel . The " octopus bite marks " numbered in the hundreds and required 90 minutes to apply . The episode 's title , " Agua Mala " , means bad water in Spanish . <unk> is also the slang name for the Portuguese Man o ' War , a venomous jellyfish similar in form to the episode 's primary antagonist .

 Darren McGavin makes an appearance as Arthur Dales in the episode , his second after being introduced in " Travelers " . McGavin , noted for his role in Kolchak : The Night Stalker which was instrumental in the tone of The X @-@ Files , was originally the casting directors ' first choice for the role of Senator Matheson in the second season episode " Little Green Men " . McGavin was later sought out to play the role of Mulder 's dad . In the end , McGavin finally agreed to appear on the show playing Arthur Dales , the agent who originally founded the X @-@ Files . McGavin was originally supposed to also appear in the Duchovny @-@ penned episode " The Unnatural " , but two days after filming began , he suffered a stroke , forcing the producers to remove his scenes from the episode and replace them with another " Arthur Dales " , played by M. Emmet Walsh .

 The episode was notable for its sheer amount of water and its lack of bright lighting . Director Rob Bowman noted that he did not film " anything for that episode during daylight , or with anything brighter than a flashlight or an emergency lamp in the hallway " . Bowman explained that " Agua Mala " was extremely difficult to film because every time a crew or cast member got wet , they " had to stop everything to dry them off " . Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny , in particular , were " water @-@ logged " for a majority of the episode 's filming . Anderson later joked , " I mean , we got drenched . It was like we were back in Vancouver ! " The show had previously filmed in Vancouver from season one to five before moving to Los Angeles , California at the beginning of the sixth season . 
 The apartment featured in the episode was built from scratch on a soundstage . Production designer Corey Kaplan received the script for " Agua Mala " around Christmas and , realizing the amount of work , immediately began drawing up plans for the set . By the time the episode was finished , the entire set was trashed and water @-@ logged and had to be thrown away . Costume designer Christine Peters was required to bring six dry replicas of each character 's wardrobe to prevent pneumonia .

 = Hurricane Andres ( 2009 ) = 
 Hurricane Andres was the first named storm and hurricane of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season . Forming on June 21 , Andres gradually intensified as it tracked along the Mexican coastline . Deep convection developed around the center of circulation and by June 23 , the storm attained hurricane @-@ status , peaking with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Upon attaining this intensity , the storm featured a developing eyewall within a central dense overcast . Within 36 hours , the storm rapidly degenerated , having most of the convection being displaced by high wind shear , becoming a non @-@ tropical trough during the afternoon of June 24 . 
 Prior to becoming a tropical depression , Andres produced heavy rainfall in Oaxaca and Honduras , resulting in two deaths . Rough seas off the coast of Guerrero resulted in one fatality . Inland , flooding caused by heavy rains killed two additional people . An additional 20 people were injured . Several dozen structures were damaged and a few were destroyed . Total losses from the hurricane reached MXN 3 million ( $ 231 @,@ 000 USD ) in Colima . Following the storm , roughly 350 people were left homeless . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Andres originated out of a tropical wave that entered the eastern Pacific basin on June 16 after crossing Central America . Over the following few days , showers and thunderstorms began to organize around the wave . At this time , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) remarked upon the possibility for tropical cyclone formation . By June 20 , the wave spawned an area of low pressure roughly 175 mi ( 280 km ) south @-@ southeast of Acapulco , Mexico . Around 1200 UTC the following day , the system had become sufficiently organized for the NHC to designate the low as Tropical Depression Two @-@ E. The depression briefly track westward before turning towards the northwest , a track which it would maintain for the remained of its existence , due to a mid @-@ tropospheric ridge located northeast of the system . 
 It continued to organize throughout the day on June 21 , developing banding features and increased convection . Several hours after being classified a depression , the system intensified into a tropical storm , at which time it received the name Andres . Upon being named , Andres marked latest date that the first named storm of a season developed since 1969 when Tropical Storm Ava developed on July 1 of that year . By the morning of June 22 , very deep thunderstorm activity existed near the center , and the overall convective pattern had become more symmetric in nature . Favorable conditions , warm sea surface temperatures , allowed Andres to gradually intensify as it tracked near the Mexican coastline . However , strong wind shear , a factor that generally weakens tropical cyclones , had little effect on the developing storm . 
 By the evening of June 22 , satellite imagery indicated the formation of an eyewall ; by this time Andres was near hurricane @-@ status . Early the next day , the center of circulation became embedded within a central dense overcast and Andres intensified into a hurricane , the first of the season , around 0600 UTC . At this time , the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 06 inHg ) ; the storm was located roughly 80 mi ( 130 km ) southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas upon attaining this intensity . Twelve hours after becoming a hurricane , most of the deep convection associated with the storm had weakened ; however , Hurricane Hunters still recorded 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) winds despite the ragged appearance of Andres . 
 By the evening of June 23 , Andres weakened to a tropical storm due to increasing wind shear , decreasing sea surface temperatures as it entered a more stable air mass . The system began to rapidly degenerate , as convection became dislocated from the center and the overall structure of Andres degraded . By 1200 UTC on June 24 , the storm weakened into a tropical depression while situated roughly 100 mi ( 155 km ) west of Cabo Corrientes , Mexico . Shortly after , the depression sharply turned north and degenerated into a trough of low pressure , no longer a tropical cyclone . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 The NHC issued several watches and warnings for portions of the Mexican coastline ; the first was a tropical storm watch for areas between Zihuatanejo and Manzanillo on June 22 . Several hours later , a portion of the watch was upgraded to a warning as Andres neared the coastline . By 1500 UTC , a hurricane watch was declared for areas between Lazaro Cardenas and Cabo Corrientes and the tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Lazaro Cardenas was discontinued . Roughly six hours later , a hurricane warning was raised for Punto San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes and the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were extended northward to Punto San Telmo . By the following afternoon , the hurricane watch was discontinued and several hours later , areas under a tropical storm warning followed suit . Early on June 24 , all watches and warnings associated with Andres were discontinued as it rapidly dissipated offshore . Authorities closed ports in Lázaro Cárdenas , Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta because of rough seas . Schools throughout Colima were closed prior to the storm and Mexican officials raised the awareness level to orange . 
 Prior to classification as a tropical cyclone , the storm dropped over 160 mm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) of rainfall in some areas , triggering flooding and landslides . Heavy rain , produced by the wave that spawned Andres , in Honduras killed two people . A river overflowed its banks , flooding homes and surrounding land . On Mexican Federal Highway 200 , gusty winds blew down about fifteen trees . In the city of Acapulco , it was reported that fallen trees damaged two cars . Rough seas led to the drowning of a fishermen in a lagoon at Tecpán de Galeana , Guerrero , while flooding caused by the storm prompted the evacuation of 200 people ; 14 shelters were opened to accommodate the evacuees . Additionally , some trees were downed along the coast . Swells up to 4 m ( 13 ft ) caused structural damage along the Mexican coastline , with the worst being around Acapulco where several bars and restaurants were damaged or destroyed . In Jalisco , 20 temporary shelters were opened to house evacuees following the storm . The Civil Protection System prepared relief materials , consisting of 600 blankets , 600 mattresses and 700 cots to house people in emergency shelters . 
 In the municipality of Atoyac de Alvarez , in the community of Cerro Prieto , 350 people were left homeless by the storm . Similarly , the paths that connect the towns of San Vicente de Jesus San Vicente and La Soledad Benítez @-@ Paradise in this town , there were cuts in solitary vehicle traffic . In the community of La Soledad , heavy rains accompanied by hail hit 38 homes , crops and coffee grounds cultivation in the region . In Colima , 50 homes and two hotels were inundated by flood waters , leaving MXN 3 million ( $ 231 @,@ 000 USD ) in damage . In Puebla , heavy rains produced by the outer bands of the hurricane triggered flooding that killed two people . In addition to the fatalities , 20 people were injured by the storm . In the wake of the storm , the Government of Mexico allocated roughly MXN 3 million ( $ 231 @,@ 000 USD ) in funds which would be distributed to 96 businesses significantly affected by the storm . These funds accounted for supplies , such as refrigerators and stoves to help restart their industries .

 = Doris Mackinnon = 
 Doris Mackinnon ( 30 September 1883 – 10 September 1956 ) was a British zoologist . Born in Scotland , her father was a Consular Agent and her mother managed a " women 's home " . Influenced by Maria Gordon , Mackinnon studied botany and geology at Aberdeen University , graduating in 1906 . She received the " Carnegie scholarship " , studying abroad for two years before returning to Scotland . She achieved her doctorate from Aberdeen University in 1914 , becoming a lecturer at Dundee University in 1916 . 
 During World War I , Mackinnon worked in military hospitals in Britain , researching and helping to diagnose amoebic dysentery . Her work in the military hospitals fuelled her interest in the topic , which she focussed on during the following years . In 1919 , Mackinnon joined King 's College , London as a lecturer and became Chair of Zoology in 1927 , the first female Chair at the college . She remained in the role as Chair and professor for 22 years . Her research work focussed on parasitic protozoa , and she gave many lectures on the subject over the period of 30 years . She also gave broadcast lectures for schools . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Doris Livingston Mackinnon was born on 30 September 1883 in Aberdeen . Her father , Lachlan Mackinnon , worked as an advocate and Consular Agent for France and Belgium . In his spare time , he was an amateur scientist , interested in botany , ornithology and astronomy . Her mother , Theodora Thompson Mackinnon , granddaughter of George Thompson , founded and managed a " women 's home " for unemployed women . Mackinnon had three siblings . One sister became a silhouette artist whilst the other , Lillias Mackinnon , became a concert pianist . A brother became an author . 
 Encouraged by Maria Gordon , Mackinnon studied botany and geology at Aberdeen University , receiving her B.Sc. in 1906 with a distinction . She was awarded the " Carnegie scholarship " , affording her the chance to study for a year under Richard Hertwig in Munich . Afterward , she joined Milano <unk> to research at Station <unk> de Roscoff and then relocated to the Quick Laboratory under George Nuttall . Mackinnon returned to Aberdeen in 1908 , where she became an assistant to John Arthur Thomson at Aberdeen University . In 1909 , she became an assistant to D 'Arcy Thompson at University College , Dundee . Whilst there , she worked on her thesis " Studies on protozoa " , which she submitted to Aberdeen University in 1914 , receiving her doctorate . Within two years , in 1916 , Mackinnon was promoted to lecturer in Dundee . 
 Whilst at Dundee , Mackinnon was given a leave of absence to help with the war effort during World War I. She worked in military hospitals in Liverpool and Southampton , where she used her knowledge of protozoology to help diagnose amoebic dysentery and other infections for the War Office . In 1918 , she was recalled to University College , Dundee , as D 'Arcy Thompson had taken a new role at St Andrews University , Mackinnon became the acting head of zoological department . 
 Mackinnon joined King 's College , London , first as a lecturer in 1919 under Arthur Dendy ; she was promoted to reader two years later . When Julian Huxley resigned as Chair of Zoology in 1927 , Mackinnon stepped up to the role which held also the title of Professor , where she would remain until her retirement in 1949 . In doing so , Mackinnon became the first female chair at King 's College . Her department produced notable academics such as Francis Brambell . After retiring , Mackinnon worked on an undergraduate textbook , " An introduction to the study of protozoa " . She fell ill before it was published , eventually dying from a stroke on 10 September 1956 , so the book was completed and edited by R. S. J. Hawes . 
 = = Work = = 
 Between May 1917 and May 1918 , Mackinnon worked at the University War Hospital in <unk> with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps , focussing on the diagnosis and treatment of dysentery . The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella <unk> which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga . They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks , making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier . They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga 's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers . 
 Mackinnon published over 40 academic papers , primarily on parasitic species of protozoa ( especially flagellates and <unk> ) . She had a reputation for her skill as a lecturer , which stemmed from her time at University College , Dundee . Mackinnon gave broadcast talks for schools and numerous lectures , with a reputation that she never repeated a lecture in 30 years of teaching . These included lectures on the diseases spread by flies , and how good hygiene and the prevention of flies breeding could stop typhoid . She also set up a research centre in protozoology , the only non @-@ medical <unk> research centre in Britain .

 During the 1930s , two genus of protozoa , <unk> and <unk> , were named after Mackinnon in recognition of her work . In 1943 , for the 50th anniversary of their first women 's admissions , Aberdeen University awarded Mackinnon and two other women an honorary LL.D. When Mackinnon retired in 1949 , she was elected professor emeritus of Kings College . She became a fellow of the Linnean Society of London and served on their council .

 The KCOM Stadium is a multi @-@ purpose facility in the city of Kingston upon Hull , England . The stadium was previously called the KC Stadium , but was renamed as part of a major rebrand by the stadium 's sponsors , telecommunications provider KCOM , on 4 April 2016 . Conceived as early as the late 1990s , it was completed in 2002 at a cost of approximately £ 44 million . The stadium is owned by Hull City Council and operated by the Stadium Management Company ( SMC ) , who are looking to expand the stadium up to 32 @,@ 000 . 
 The bowl @-@ shaped stadium contains a continuous single tier of seats with a second tier on the west side . Its current capacity is 25 @,@ 400 . The stadium accommodates fans of its two tenants , association football club Hull City A.F.C. , which moved there from Boothferry Park , and rugby league football club Hull F.C. , relocated from the Boulevard . The ground also hosts international association football and rugby league football competitions and acts as a venue for concerts by musical artists , such as Elton John and The Who . 
 = = History = = 
 The idea of a new stadium for Kingston upon Hull , whose professional football club Hull City had played at Boothferry Park since 1946 , was first mooted in 1997 , but funds to finance such a project only became available when the city council sold a portion of its holdings in Kingston Communications . The council provided most of the funds , more than £ 42 million , with the rest stemming from government single regeneration budget grants and from the Football Stadium Improvement Fund . 
 The council appointed John Topliss to head the stadium construction project . He and his team partnered with consulting firm Drivers Jonas to explore preliminary issues such as stadium location , seating capacity , and facilities offered . Stated Mr. Topliss : " We had a totally blank canvas and , working with consultants , made a thorough assessment of what was needed . " 
 The project team considered over a dozen sites , inside and outside of the city , before settling on The Circle in West Park . Factors contributing to the decision include transport guidance , central government planning guidelines , existing athletic facilities , isolation from residential areas , and council ownership . 
 The final recommendation of Drivers Jonas included additional facilities for both indoor and outdoor sports for the people of West Hull in addition to the main stadium , planned to seat from 25 @,@ 000 to 30 @,@ 000 spectators . Professional services firm Arup Associates provided initial concept proposals for the stadium . The Miller Partnership , an architectural and interior design firm , adopted these proposals during the stadium 's design . 
 In spite of obstacles during the course of the project , including Hull City A.F.C. ' s receivership in 2001 ( just after the granting of planning permission ) , the stadium complex was completed on time ( in fourteen months ) and on budget ( at approximately GB £ 44 million ) . The stadium opened its doors on 18 December 2002 . Hull City beat Sunderland A.F.C. 1 – 0 in a friendly match to mark the occasion . Steve Melton scored the goal , the first at the KC Stadium .

On 4 July 2011 , Hull City revealed that the stadium 's west stand would be sponsored by the local Cranswick plc under a two @-@ year agreement , which was extended on 26 July 2013 . On 10 July 2013 it was announced the east stand would be sponsored by Ideal Standard and become known as the Ideal Standard Community East Stand . 
 Corporate hospitality is provided by 28 executive boxes located between the two tiers of the Cranswick plc West Stand , while security of the stadium is handled using 57 closed @-@ circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras that cover the stadium . Over the summer of 2007 , SMC installed an LED screen in the Smith & Nephew North Stand to replace the old electronic scoreboard . The screen has an area of approximately 40 m ² ( 430 ft . ² ) and displays such content as live home game feeds , match highlights , interviews , and action replays . 
 The stadium 's seats are mostly black , with a band of white and amber seats around the circumference . White and amber seats form the word Hull in the north and south stands . In the Ideal Standard Community East Stand , the seats form an image of a coronet , a symbol of the city that also appears in the club crest for Hull and in the coat of arms of the city council . Black , white , and amber were chosen to remain neutral toward the colours of its two tenants : black and white for Hull and black and amber for Hull City A.F.C. The blue and gold of owner Hull City Council appear in the stadium 's four external columns . 
 The size of the playing surface is 114 x 74 metres ( 125 x 81 yd ) and made of rye grass with a 3 % additive of artificial grass . This provides ample room for a FIFA @-@ regulation association football pitch of 105 x 68 metres ( 115 x 74 yd ) and a standard rugby league football pitch of 100 x 68 metres ( 109 x 74 yd ) . The playing surface has an automated watering system and below @-@ surface heating . 
 Set within Hull 's West Park , the stadium is the first in England to be built in a parkland setting . The stadium complex also includes the 1 @,@ 500 seat Bonus Arena , a skate park , two multi @-@ use all weather pitches , a community learning zone complete with classrooms , a health & fitness suite , a cyber cafe , and a library . 
 The KCOM Stadium has received several honours . It was named the chief new development in Yorkshire at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Pro @-@ Yorkshire Awards . It was also on the shortlist for the Prime Minister 's Award for Better Public Building and received a high commendation in the British Construction Industry Awards in the Best Value category . In a 2005 poll that was carried out by Drivers Jonas and decided by football fans from across the country , the KC Stadium was rated highest in comfort , services and view among all grounds in the Football League and was also rated the most @-@ improved venue . 
 On 13 August 2013 a Goal Decision System by Hawk @-@ Eye was installed in the ground ahead of the 2013 – 14 Premier League season which requires the use of goal @-@ line technology to indicate if a goal is scored .

 The stadium replaced Boothferry Park as home to Hull City Association Football Club , and was the backdrop for the club 's recent climb through the English Football League . It first hosted the club 's home games during the second half of the 2002 – 03 season ; the first competitive match was against Hartlepool United , a game that Hull City won by a score of 2 – 0 . Hull City , nicknamed the Tigers , attracted an average attendance of almost 17 @,@ 000 in their first full season at the KC Stadium , 2003 – 04 . This figure is more than three times the average Third Division attendance for that season , and was only matched or exceeded by clubs in the Premier League and the First Division . However , the level of support was not matched by on @-@ field performances ; the Tigers finished 13th in their first season at the KC Stadium . However , in 2003 – 04 ( their first full season at the new ground ) , Hull won promotion as Third Division runners @-@ up , securing their place in the newly named League One ( previously the Second Division ) . A second successive promotion to the Championship , again as runners @-@ up , followed in 2004 – 05 . 
 Attendances for Hull City 's league games at the KCOM Stadium have averaged above 16 @,@ 000 in each full season they have played there . The stadium hosted Premier League football in the 2008 – 09 and 2009 – 10 seasons , with all 20 @,@ 500 available season tickets selling out shortly after Hull City 's Championship play @-@ off victory at Wembley Stadium . The record attendance for a Premier League match is 25 @,@ 030 set on 9 May 2010 for the last match of the season against Liverpool beating the previous record of 25 @,@ 023 set on 13 March 2010 against Arsenal . While playing in the Championship , the record stood at 24 @,@ 350 on 26 April 2008 for the visit of Crystal Palace , beating that of 24 @,@ 311 on 30 January 2007 for the visit of local rivals Leeds United . Segregation between home fans and away fans prevents the stadium 's stated capacity from being reached . 
 Plans have been prepared for the potential extension of the stadium following Hull City 's promotion to the Premier League . 4 @,@ 500 seats could be added in a second tier to the east stand , and 2 @,@ 000 seats each in the north and south stands , giving the stadium a capacity of approximately 34 @,@ 000 . In 2011 , the club 's owner Assem Allam announced that he wanted to buy the stadium freehold so he could develop , as he stated , " a sports park " on the site . 
 After Hull City Council refused , Allam stated " I had in mind £ 30 million to spend on the infrastructure of the club , to increase the stadium by 10 @,@ 000 and to have commercial activities around the stadium – cafeterias , shops , supermarkets – to have all this to create income for the club so that in the future it can be self @-@ financing and not relying on me . " 
 On 9 August 2013 , Allam announced that the club will discard its 109 @-@ year @-@ old name and , henceforth , be " marketed " as Hull City Tigers locally and Hull Tigers to national and international audiences . Announcing the change in the Hull Daily Mail newspaper , he said : " ' Hull City ' is irrelevant ... it is common . I want the club to be special . It is about identity . ' City ' is a lousy identity . ' Hull City Association Football Club ' is so long . " The club 's Managing Director Nick Thompson urged supporters " to judge it in the fullness of time . " The announcement stated that all references to " AFC " on club branding will be phased out , although they will remain on the shirt crest during their first season back in the Premier League . 
 Allam justified the name change as part of his plans to create " additional sources of revenue " for the club . He dismissed fans ' protests against the name change , stating " nobody questions my decisions in my business . "

 = HIP 78530 b = 
 HIP 78530 b is an object that is either a planet or a brown dwarf in the orbit of the star HIP 78530 . It was observed as early as 2000 , but the object was not confirmed as one in orbit of the star HIP 78530 until a direct imaging project photographed the star in 2008 . The image caught the attention of the project 's science team , so the team followed up on its initial observations . HIP 78530 b orbits a young , hot , bright blue star in the Upper Scorpius association . The planet itself is over twenty @-@ three times more massive than Jupiter , orbiting eighteen times further from its host star than Pluto does from the Sun by the estimates published in its discovery paper . In this predicted orbit , HIP 78530 b completes an orbit every twelve thousand years . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 Between 2000 and 2001 , the <unk> system at the ESO 3 @.@ 6 m Telescope in Chile detected a faint object in the vicinity of HIP 78530 . This object was reported in 2005 and 2007 , although the astronomers investigating the star were not able to tell , based on their observations , if the faint object was an orbiting companion or not . The team did not follow up on this . 
 The random selection of ninety @-@ one stars in the Upper Scorpius association provided a sample of stars to be observed using the Near Infrared Imager and Spectrometer ( <unk> ) and Altitude conjugate Adaptive Optics for the Infrared ( <unk> ) adaptive optics system at the Gemini Observatory . Among the ninety stars selected for direct imaging was the star HIP 78530 , which was first imaged by the camera on May 24 , 2008 . This initial image revealed the presence of the same faint object within the vicinity of HIP 78530 . 
 Follow @-@ up imaging took place on July 2 , 2009 and August 30 , 2010 using the same instruments , as astronomers hoped to reveal this companion object 's proper motion , or the rate that it moves over time . Additional follow @-@ up data was recovered in the spring and summer of 2010 , but large errors in the data 's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it . The observations over the three years was compiled , with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images ' quality . The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530 , but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size . Further study would be needed to prove its true nature . 
 On July 2 , 2009 , July 3 , 2009 , and August 8 , 2009 , use of the <unk> integral field spectrograph with <unk> allowed the astronomers to collect data on the spectrum of the faint object and its star . Analysis of the spectra and the objects ' astrometry ( how the star and the faint object change position in the sky ) led to the confirmation of the companion HIP 78530 b . 
 The confirmation of HIP 78530 b was reported on January 24 , 2011 . In imaging the ninety @-@ one stars , HIP 78530 b and <unk> @-@ <unk> were discovered . The discoveries of these two orbiting bodies allowed astronomers to predict that bodies with such low planet / brown dwarf @-@ to @-@ star mass ratios ( below 0 @.@ 01 ) orbiting at a distance of hundreds of AU exists in the orbits of 2 @.@ 2 + 5 @.@ 5 
 − 1 @.@ 9 % of all stars . However , this number is a lower limit , as astronomers have been unable to detect smaller , low @-@ mass planets that fit this scenario . 
 = = Host star = = 
 HIP 78530 is a bright , blue B @-@ type main sequence star in the Upper Scorpius association , a loose star cluster composed of stars with a common origin . The star is estimated to be approximately 2 @.@ 5 times the mass of the Sun . Ages of the Upper Scorpius group have been quoted at 5 million years , however a more recent estimate suggests that the group is somewhat older ( approximately 11 million years old ) . Its effective temperature is estimated at <unk> K , less than twice the effective temperature of the Sun . 
 HIP 78530 has an apparent magnitude of 7 @.@ 18 . It is incredibly faint , if visible at all , as seen from the unaided eye of an observer on Earth . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 HIP 78530 b is most likely a brown dwarf , a massive object that is large enough to fuse deuterium ( something that planets are too small to do ) but not large enough to ignite and become a star . Because HIP 78530 b 's characteristics blend the line between whether or not it is a brown dwarf or a planet , astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet @-@ like or star @-@ like ( how brown dwarves are formed ) manner . 
 Its estimated mass is over 23 @.@ 04 times that of Jupiter . Additionally , HIP 78530 b orbits its host star at an estimated average distance of 710 AU , which is 710 times the average distance between the Earth and the Sun assuming the brown dwarf has a circular orbit . The average distance between dwarf planet Pluto and the Sun is 39 @.@ 482 AU , meaning that HIP 78530 b orbits its host star nearly eighteen times further than Pluto orbits the Sun . In accordance with the data , HIP 78530 b would complete an orbit approximately every 12 @,@ 000 years , although the actual orbital motion of HIP 78530 b is most likely smaller than 710 AU , but it has not been directly observed long enough to know definitively .

 = The Prince of Egypt = 
 The Prince of Egypt is a 1998 American animated epic musical drama biblical film and the first traditionally animated film produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures . The film is an adaptation of the Book of Exodus and follows the life of Moses from being a prince of Egypt to his ultimate destiny to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt . The film was directed by Brenda Chapman , Simon Wells and Steve <unk> . The film featured songs written by Stephen Schwartz and a score composed by Hans Zimmer . The voice cast featured a number of major Hollywood actors in the speaking roles , while professional singers replaced them for the songs , except for Michelle Pfeiffer , Ralph Fiennes , Steve Martin , Martin Short , and Ofra Haza ( who also sang her character 's number , " Deliver Us " , in seventeen other languages for the film 's dubbing ) , who sang their own parts . 
 Jeffrey Katzenberg had frequently suggested an animated adaption of the 1956 film The Ten Commandments while working for The Walt Disney Company , and he decided to put the idea into production after founding DreamWorks in 1995 . To make this inaugural project , DreamWorks Animation employed artists who had worked for Walt Disney Feature Animation and the recently disbanded <unk> , totaling a crew of 350 people from 34 different nations . The film has a blend of traditional animation and computer @-@ generated imagery , created using software from Toon Boom Animation and Silicon Graphics . 
 The Prince of Egypt was released in theaters on December 18 , 1998 , and on home video on September 14 , 1999 . Reviews were positive , with critics praising the animation , music and voice work . The film went on to gross $ 218 @,@ 613 @,@ 188 worldwide in theaters , which made it the most successful non @-@ Disney animated feature at the time . The film 's success led to the direct @-@ to @-@ video prequel Joseph : King of Dreams ( 2000 ) and the development of a stage adaptation . The song " When You Believe " became a commercially successful single in a pop version performed by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey , and went on to win Best Original Song at the 1999 Academy Awards . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Ancient Egypt , Yocheved ( Ofra Haza ) , a Hebrew mother , and her two children , Miriam and Aaron , watch in horror as the newborn Hebrew boys are taken and ruthlessly killed as ordered by Pharaoh Seti I ( Patrick Stewart ) , who fears that an alarming increase could lead to rebellion . Fearing for her own newborn son 's safety , Yocheved places him in a basket afloat on the Nile River , not before bidding him farewell with a final but powerful lullaby . Miriam follows the basket to the Pharaoh 's palace and witnesses her baby brother safely adopted by Queen Tuya ( Helen Mirren ) , who names him Moses . 
 Years later , Moses ( Val Kilmer ) and his brother Rameses II ( Ralph Fiennes ) are scolded by their father for accidentally destroying a temple during one of their youthful misadventures , though Moses tries to take the blame . That evening at a palace banquet , Seti , who wants to give Rameses the opportunity to prove that he is responsible , names him Prince Regent and gives him authority over Egypt 's temples . As a tribute , the high priests Hotep ( Steve Martin ) and Huy ( Martin Short ) offer him a beautiful young <unk> woman , Tzipporah ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) , and Rameses gives her to Moses . Rameses then appoints him Royal Chief Architect . 
 Later that evening , Moses follows Tzipporah as she escapes from the palace and runs into his siblings Miriam ( Sandra Bullock ) and Aaron ( Jeff Goldblum ) . Miriam is overjoyed to see her younger brother again , but Aaron is fearful to watch the confrontation . Despite Aaron 's attempts to protect his sister , Miriam tries to tell Moses about his past , but he refuses to listen . Miriam then sings her mother 's lullaby , which causes Moses to remember the melody . Moses runs to the palace , eager to return to familiar surroundings . The truth about his past is later confirmed by a nightmare , and finally by Seti himself . The next morning , Moses accidentally pushes an Egyptian guard off the scaffolding of the temple when trying to stop him from whipping a Hebrew slave , and the guard falls to his death . 
 Ashamed and confused , Moses flees into the desert in exile , despite Rameses ' pleas to stay . While in the desert Moses defends three young girls from bandits , only to find out their older sister is Tzipporah , whom he helped escape from Egypt . Moses is welcomed by Tzipporah 's father and the high priest of Midian , Jethro ( Danny Glover ) . After assimilating this new culture , Moses becomes a shepherd and marries Tzipporah . While chasing a stray lamb , Moses discovers a burning bush through which God tells him to go back to Egypt and guide the Hebrew slaves to freedom . God bestows Moses ' shepherding staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say . Moses and Tzipporah return to Egypt , where Moses is happily greeted by Rameses , who is now Pharaoh . 
 When Moses requests the Hebrews ' release and changes his staff into an Egyptian cobra , to demonstrate his alliance with God , Hotep and Huy boastfully recreate this transformation , only to have their snakes eaten by Moses ' snake . Rather than persuaded , Rameses doubles the Hebrews ' workload . Moses and Tzipporah thereafter live with Miriam , who convinces Aaron and the other Hebrews to trust them . Later , Moses inflicts nine of the Plagues of Egypt , but Rameses refuses to relent despite each plague being worse than the one before . Against Moses ' warning ( foreshadowing the final plague ) , Rameses makes it clear that he will never release the Hebrew slaves . Disheartened by Rameses ' words , Moses prepares the Hebrews for the tenth and final plague , instructing them to sacrifice a lamb and mark the doorposts with the lamb 's blood . That night , the final plague kills all the firstborn children of Egypt , including Rameses ' son , while sparing those of the Hebrews . The next day , a grief @-@ stricken Rameses , mourning the loss of his son , finally gives Moses permission to free the Hebrews . Moses breaks down crying from the guilt of hurting Rameses , and from hearing the cries of numerous families across the city . 
 The following morning , the Hebrews leave Egypt , led by Moses , Miriam , Aaron , and Tzipporah . At the Red Sea , they discover that Rameses is closely pursuing them with his army . Upon the arrival , Moses uses his staff to part the sea , while a fire blocks the army 's way . The Hebrews cross the open sea bottom ; and when the fire vanishes and the army gives chase , the water closes over the Egyptian soldiers , sparing Rameses alone , who is washed ashore on the other side of the sea . Thereafter , Moses sadly bids farewell to his brother , and leads the Hebrews to Mount Sinai , where he receives the Ten Commandments .

 Former Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg had always wanted to do an animated adaption of The Ten Commandments . While working for The Walt Disney Company , Katzenberg suggested this idea to Michael Eisner , but he refused . The idea for the film was brought back at the formation of DreamWorks SKG in 1994 , when Katzenberg 's partners , Amblin Entertainment founder Steven Spielberg , and music producer David Geffen , were meeting in Spielberg 's living room . Katzenberg recalls that Spielberg looked at him during the meeting and said , " You ought to do The Ten Commandments . " 
 The Prince of Egypt was " written " throughout the story process . Beginning with a starting outline , Story Supervisors Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook led a team of fourteen storyboard artists and writers as they sketched out the entire film — sequence by sequence . Once the storyboards were approved , they were put into the Avid Media Composer digital editing system by editor Nick Fletcher to create a " story reel " or animatic . The story reel allowed the filmmakers to view and edit the entire film in continuity before production began , and also helped the layout and animation departments understand what is happening in each sequence of the film . After casting of the voice talent concluded , dialogue recording sessions began . For the film , the actors record individually in a studio under guidance by one of the three directors . The voice tracks were to become the primary aspect as to which the animators built their performances . Because DreamWorks was concerned about theological accuracy , Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to call in Biblical scholars , Christian , Jewish and Muslim theologians , and Arab American leaders to help his film be more accurate and faithful to the original story . After previewing the developing film , all these leaders noted that the studio executives listened and responded to their ideas , and praised the studio for reaching out for comment from outside sources . 
 = = = Design and animation = = = 
 Art directors Kathy Altieri and Richard Chavez and Production Designer <unk> Gogol led a team of nine visual development artists in setting a visual style for the film that was representative of the time , the scale and the architectural style of Ancient Egypt . Part of the process also included the research and collection of artwork from various artists , as well as taking part in trips such as a two @-@ week travel across Egypt by the filmmakers before the film 's production began . 
 Character Designers Carter Goodrich , Carlos <unk> and Nicolas <unk> worked on setting the design and overall look of the characters . Drawing on various inspirations for the widely known characters , the team of character designers worked on designs that had a more realistic feel than the usual animated characters up to that time . Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical , more angular look of the Egyptians versus the more organic , natural look of the Hebrews and their related environments . The Backgrounds department , headed by supervisors Paul <unk> and Ron Lukas , oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets / backdrops from the layouts . Within the film , approximately 934 hand @-@ painted backgrounds were created . 
 The animation team for The Prince of Egypt , including 350 artists from 34 different nations , was primarily recruited both from Walt Disney Feature Animation , which had fallen under Katzenberg 's auspices while at The Walt Disney Company , and from <unk> , a defunct division of Steven Spielberg 's Amblin Entertainment . As at Disney 's , character animators were grouped into teams by character : for example , Kristof <unk> , as the supervising animator of Older Moses , set the acting style of the character and assigned scenes to his team . Consideration was given to properly depicting the ethnicities of the ancient Egyptians , Hebrews , and Nubians seen in the film . 
 There are 1192 scenes in the film , and 1180 contain work done by the special effects department , which animates everything in an animated scene which is not a character : blowing wind , dust , rainwater , shadows , etc . A blend of traditional animation and computer @-@ generated imagery was used in the depictions of the ten plagues of Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea . The animated characters were digitally inked and painted using Cambridge Systems ' Animo software system ( now merged with Toon Boom ) , and the compositing of the 2D and 3D elements was done using the " Exposure Tool " , a digital solution developed for DreamWorks by Silicon Graphics . 
 = = = Creating the voice of God = = = 
 The task of creating God 's voice was given to Lon Bender and the team working with the film 's music composer , Hans Zimmer . " The challenge with that voice was to try to evolve it into something that had not been heard before , " says Bender . " We did a lot of research into the voices that had been used for past Hollywood movies as well as for radio shows , and we were trying to create something that had never been previously heard not only from a casting standpoint but from a voice manipulation standpoint as well . The solution was to use the voice of actor Val Kilmer to suggest the kind of voice we hear inside our own heads in our everyday lives , as opposed to the larger than life tones with which God has been endowed in prior cinematic incarnations . " As a result , in the final film , Kilmer gave voice to Moses and God , as well , yet the suggestion is that someone else would have heard God speak to them in their own voice . 
 = = Music = = 
 Composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz began working on writing songs for the film from the beginning of the film 's production . As the story evolved , he continued to write songs that would serve to both entertain and help move the story along . Composer Hans Zimmer arranged and produced the songs and then eventually wrote the film 's score . The film 's score was recorded entirely in London , England . 
 Three soundtrack albums were released simultaneously for The Prince of Egypt , each of them aimed towards a different target audience . While the other two accompanying records , the country @-@ themed " Nashville " soundtrack and the gospel @-@ based " Inspirational " soundtrack , functioned as film tributes , the official The Prince of Egypt soundtrack contained the actual songs from the film . This album combines elements from the score composed by Hans Zimmer and film songs by Stephen Schwartz . The songs were either voiced over by professional singers ( such as Salisbury Cathedral Choir ) , or sung by the film 's voice actors , such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Ofra Haza . Various tracks by contemporary artists such as K @-@ Ci & JoJo and Boyz II Men were added , including the Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston duet " When You Believe " , a Babyface rewrite of the original Schwartz composition , sung by Michelle Pfeiffer and Sally Dworsky in the film .

Despite being the inaugural production by DreamWorks Animation , it wound up the second to get a theatrical release , as Antz was rushed to reach theatres in September . The international release occurred simultaneously to the United States , as according to DreamWorks ' distribution chief Jim Tharp , opening one week prior to the " global holiday " of Christmas , audiences all over the world would be available at the same time . 
 The accompanying marketing campaign aimed to bring more adults , usually averse to animated films . Merchandising was limited to a line of collectible figures and books .

 = Maple syrup = 
 Maple syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple , red maple , or black maple trees , although it can also be made from other maple species . In cold climates , these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter ; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring . Maple trees can be tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap , which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water , leaving the concentrated syrup . 
 Maple syrup was first collected and used by the indigenous peoples of North America , and the practice was adopted by European settlers , who gradually refined production methods . Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing . The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer , responsible for 75 % of the world 's output ; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2014 were C $ 380 million ( approximately US $ 300 million ) , with Quebec accounting for 85 % of this total . Vermont is the largest producer in the United States , generating about 6 % of the global supply . 
 Maple syrup is graded according to the Canada , United States , or Vermont scales based on its density and translucency . Sucrose is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup . In Canada , syrups must be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup and must also be at least 66 percent sugar . In the United States , a syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap to be labelled as " maple " , though states such as Vermont and New York have more restrictive definitions ( see below ) . 
 Maple syrup is often eaten with pancakes , waffles , French toast , oatmeal or porridge . It is also used as an ingredient in baking , and as a sweetener or flavouring agent . Culinary experts have praised its unique flavour , although the chemistry responsible is not fully understood . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Indigenous peoples = = = 
 Indigenous peoples living in northeastern North America were the first groups known to have produced maple syrup and maple sugar . According to aboriginal oral traditions , as well as archaeological evidence , maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region . There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began , but various legends exist ; one of the most popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief . Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to <unk> , <unk> , or the squirrel . Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar @-@ making , celebrating the Sugar Moon ( the first full moon of spring ) with a Maple Dance . Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup . 
 The Algonquians recognized maple sap as a source of energy and nutrition . At the beginning of the spring thaw , they used stone tools to make V @-@ shaped incisions in tree trunks ; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into buckets , which were often made from birch bark . The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top . While there was widespread agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States , the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in the Northeast that is not a European colonial import . 
 = = = Europeans = = = 
 In the early stages of European colonization in northeastern North America , local Indigenous peoples showed the arriving colonists how to tap the trunks of certain types of maples during the spring thaw to harvest the sap . André <unk> , the " Royal <unk> of France " , wrote about Jacques Cartier drinking maple sap during his Canadian voyages . By 1680 , European settlers and fur traders were involved in harvesting maple products . However , rather than making incisions in the bark , the Europeans used the method of drilling <unk> in the trunks with augers . During the 17th and 18th centuries , processed maple sap was used primarily as a source of concentrated sugar , in both liquid and crystallized @-@ solid form , as cane sugar had to be imported from the West Indies . 
 Maple <unk> parties typically began to operate at the start of the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples . Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks , usually more than one hole per large tree ; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap . The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment 's core from one end of the cylinder , creating a seamless , watertight container . Sap filled the buckets , and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels ( barrels , large pots , or hollowed @-@ out wooden logs ) , often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals , or carried in buckets or other convenient containers . The sap @-@ collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees , and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained " sweet " . The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were , and still are , critical in determining the length of the <unk> season . As the weather continues to warm , a maple tree 's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap , making it unpalatable , perhaps due to an increase in amino acids . 
 The boiling process was very time @-@ consuming . The harvested sap was transported back to the party 's base camp , where it was then poured into large vessels ( usually made from metal ) and boiled to achieve the desired consistency . The sap was usually transported using large barrels pulled by horses or oxen to a central collection point , where it was processed either over a fire built out in the open or inside a shelter built for that purpose ( the " sugar shack " ) . 
 = = = Since 1850 = = = 
 Around the time of the American Civil War , syrup makers started using large , flat sheet metal pans as they were more efficient for boiling than heavy , rounded iron kettles , because of a greater surface area for evaporation . Around this time , cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US ; as a result , producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup . The first evaporator , used to heat and concentrate sap , was patented in 1858 . In 1872 , an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox , which greatly decreased boiling time . Around 1900 , producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues , which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time . Some producers also added a finishing pan , a separate batch evaporator , as a final stage in the evaporation process . 
 Buckets began to be replaced with plastic bags , which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected . Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped ( the <unk> ) to the evaporator . Some producers adopted motor @-@ powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container , but these techniques were not widely used . Heating methods also diversified : modern producers use wood , oil , natural gas , propane , or steam to evaporate sap . Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup . 
 A large number of technological changes took place during the 1970s . Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since the early part of the century were perfected , and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house . Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems , and <unk> were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam . Producers developed reverse @-@ osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled , increasing processing efficiency . 
 Improvements in tubing and vacuum pumps , new filtering techniques , " supercharged " <unk> , and better storage containers have since been developed . Research continues on pest control and improved woodlot management . In 2009 , researchers at the University of Vermont unveiled a new type of tap that prevents <unk> of sap into the tree , reducing bacterial contamination and preventing the tree from attempting to heal the bore hole . Experiments show that it may be possible to use saplings in a plantation instead of mature trees dramatically boosting productivity per acre . 
 = = Processing = = 
 Production methods have been streamlined since colonial days , yet remain basically unchanged . Sap must first be collected and boiled down to obtain pure syrup without chemical agents or preservatives . Maple syrup is made by boiling between 20 and 50 volumes of sap ( depending on its concentration ) over an open fire until 1 volume of syrup is obtained , usually at a temperature 4 @.@ 1 ° C ( 7 @.@ 4 ° F ) over the boiling point of water . As the boiling point of water varies with changes in air pressure the correct value for pure water is determined at the place where the syrup is being produced , each time evaporation is begun and periodically throughout the day . Syrup can be boiled entirely over one heat source or can be drawn off into smaller batches and boiled at a more controlled temperature . 
 Boiling the syrup is a tightly controlled process , which ensures appropriate sugar content . Syrup boiled too long will eventually crystallize , whereas under @-@ boiled syrup will be watery , and will quickly spoil . The finished syrup has a density of 66 ° on the Brix scale ( a <unk> scale used to measure sugar solutions ) . The syrup is then filtered to remove sugar sand , crystals made up largely of sugar and calcium malate . These crystals are not toxic , but create a " gritty " texture in the syrup if not filtered out . The filtered syrup is graded and packaged while still hot , usually at a temperature of 82 ° C ( 180 ° F ) or greater . The containers are turned over after being sealed to sterilize the cap with the hot syrup . Packages can be made of metal , glass , or coated plastic , depending on volume and target market . The syrup can also be heated longer and further processed to create a variety of other maple products , including maple sugar , maple butter or cream , and maple candy or taffy . 
 = = = Off @-@ flavours = = = 
 Off @-@ flavours can sometimes develop during the production of maple syrup ; causes include contaminants in the boiling apparatus , such as paint or cleanser ; changes in the sap , such as fermentation when it has been left sitting too long ; and changes in the tree , such as " buddy sap " late in the season when budding has begun . In some circumstances it is possible to remove off @-@ flavours through processing . 
 = = Production = = 
 Maple syrup production is centred in northeastern North America ; however , given the correct weather conditions , it can be made wherever suitable species of maple trees grow . 
 A maple syrup production farm is called a " <unk> " or " <unk> " . Sap is often boiled in a " sugar house " ( also known as a " sugar shack , " " sugar shanty , " or <unk> à <unk> ) , a building louvered at the top to vent the steam from the boiling sap . 
 Maples are usually tapped beginning at 30 to 40 years of age . Each tree can support between one and three taps , depending on its trunk diameter . The average maple tree will produce 35 to 50 litres ( 9 @.@ 2 to 13 @.@ 2 US gal ) of sap per season , up to 12 litres ( 3 @.@ 2 US gal ) per day . This is roughly equal to 7 % of its total sap . Seasons last for four to eight weeks , depending on the weather . During the day , starch stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap , allowing it to be tapped . Sap is not tapped at night because the temperature drop inhibits sap flow , although taps are typically left in place overnight . Some producers also tap in autumn , though this practice is less common than spring tapping . Maples can continue to be tapped for sap until they are over 100 years old . 
 = = Commerce = = 
 Until the 1930s , the United States produced most of the world 's maple syrup . Today , after rapid growth in the 1990s , Canada produces more than 80 percent of the world 's maple syrup , producing about 26 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 litres ( 7 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 US gal ) in 2004 . The vast majority of this comes from the province of Quebec , which is the world 's largest producer , with about 75 percent of global production totalling 24 @,@ 660 @,@ 000 litres ( 6 @,@ 510 @,@ 000 US gal ) in 2005 . As of 2003 , Quebec had more than 7 @,@ 000 producers , collectively making over 24 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 litres ( 6 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 US gal ) of syrup . Production in Quebec is controlled through a supply management system , with producers receiving quota allotments from the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers ( Fédération des <unk> <unk> du Québec ) , which also maintains reserves of syrup although there is a black @-@ market trade in Quebec product . Canada exports more than 9 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 litres ( 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 US gal ) of maple syrup per year , valued at more than C $ 145 million . The provinces of Ontario , Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , and Prince Edward Island produce smaller amounts of syrup . 
 The Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan produce maple syrup using the sap of the box elder or Manitoba maple ( Acer <unk> ) . A Manitoba maple tree 's yield is usually less than half that of a similar sugar maple tree . Manitoba maple syrup has a slightly different flavour from sugar @-@ maple syrup , because it contains less sugar and the tree 's sap flows more slowly . 
 Vermont is the biggest US producer , with over 1 @,@ 320 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 L ) during the 2013 season , followed by New York with 574 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 2 @,@ 170 @,@ 000 L ) and Maine with 450 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 1 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 L ) . Wisconsin , Ohio , New Hampshire , Michigan , Pennsylvania , Massachusetts , and Connecticut all produced marketable quantities of maple syrup of less than 265 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 L ) each in 2013 . As of 2003 , Vermont produced about 5 @.@ 5 percent of the global syrup supply . 
 Maple syrup has been produced on a small scale in some other countries , notably Japan and South Korea . However , in South Korea in particular , it is traditional to consume maple sap , called <unk> , instead of processing it into syrup . 
 In 2013 , 65 % of Canadian maple syrup exports went to the United States ( a value of C $ 178 million ) , 9 % to Japan ( C $ 25 million ) , 8 % to Germany ( C $ 22 million ) and 4 @.@ 3 % to the United Kingdom ( C $ 12 million ) .

 Following an effort from the International Maple Syrup Institute ( <unk> ) and many maple syrup producer associations , both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding the classification of maple syrup to be uniform . Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup , now those laws define a unified grading system . This had been a work in progress for several years , and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014 . The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors , at the request of the <unk> . 
 As of December 31 , 2014 , the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ( <unk> ) and as of March 2 , 2015 , the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Agricultural Marketing Service ( AMS ) issued revised standards on the classification of maple syrup as follows : 
 Grade A 
 Golden Colour and Delicate Taste 
 Amber Colour and Rich Taste 
 Dark Colour and Robust Taste 
 Very Dark Colour and Strong Taste 
 Processing Grade 
 Substandard 
 As long as maple syrup does not have an off @-@ flavour and is of a uniform colour and clean and free from cloudiness , turbidity , sediment , it can be identified as one of the A grades . If it exhibits any of these problems , it does not meet Grade A requirements and must be labeled as Processing Grade maple syrup and may not be sold to the consumer . If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple syrup ( including a fairly characteristic maple taste ) , it is classified as Substandard . 
 As of February 2015 , this grading system has been accepted and made law by most maple @-@ producing states and provinces , other than Ontario , Quebec , and Ohio . Vermont , in an effort to " jump @-@ start " the new grading regulations , adopted the new grading system as of January 1 , 2014 , after the grade changes passed the Senate and House in 2013 . Maine passed a bill to take effect as soon as both Canada and the United States adopted the new grades . They are allowing a one @-@ year grace period . In New York , the new grade changes became law on January 1 , 2015 , with a one @-@ year grace period . New Hampshire did not require legislative approval and so the new grade laws became effective as of December 16 , 2014 , and producer compliance is required as of January 1 , 2016 . 
 Golden and Amber grades typically have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark , which are both dark and have an intense maple flavour . The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking , although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use . Syrup harvested earlier in the season tends to yield a lighter colour . With the new grading system , the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its translucence . Golden has to be more than 75 percent translucent , Amber has to be 50 @.@ 0 to 74 @.@ 9 percent translucent , Dark has to be 25 @.@ 0 to 49 @.@ 9 percent translucent , and Very Dark is any product less than 25 @.@ 0 percent translucent . 
 = = = Old grading system = = = 
 In Canada , maple syrup was classified prior to December 31 , 2014 , by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ( <unk> ) as one of three grades , each with several colour classes : Canada No. 1 , including Extra Light , Light , and Medium ; No. 2 Amber ; and No. 3 Dark or any other ungraded category . Producers in Ontario or Québec may have followed either federal or provincial grading guidelines . Québec 's and Ontario 's guidelines differed slightly from the federal : there were two " number " categories in Québec ( Number 1 , with four colour classes , and 2 , with five colour classes ) . As in Québec , Ontario 's producers had two " number " grades : 1 , with three colour classes ; and 2 , with one colour class , which was typically referred to as " Ontario Amber " when produced and sold in that province only . A typical year 's yield for a maple syrup producer will be about 25 to 30 percent of each of the # 1 colours , 10 percent # 2 Amber , and 2 percent # 3 Dark . 
 The United States used ( some states still do , as they await state regulation ) different grading standards . Maple syrup was divided into two major grades : Grade A and Grade B. Grade A was further divided into three <unk> : Light Amber ( sometimes known as Fancy ) , Medium Amber , and Dark Amber . The Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets used a similar grading system of colour , and is roughly equivalent , especially for lighter syrups , but using letters : " AA " , " A " , etc . The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density ( measured on the <unk> scale ) . New Hampshire maintained a similar standard , but not a separate state grading scale . The Vermont @-@ graded product had 0 @.@ 9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US @-@ graded . One grade of syrup not for table use , called commercial or Grade C , was also produced under the Vermont system .

 The basic ingredient in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various other species of maple trees . It consists primarily of sucrose and water , with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the invert sugar created in the boiling process . 
 In a 100g amount , maple syrup provides 260 calories and is composed of 32 % water by weight , 67 % carbohydrates ( 90 % of which are sugars ) , and no appreciable protein or fat ( table ) . Maple syrup is generally low in overall micronutrient content , although manganese and riboflavin are at high levels along with moderate amounts of zinc and calcium ( right table ) . It also contains trace amounts of amino acids which increase in content as sap flow occurs . 
 Maple syrup contains a wide variety of volatile organic compounds , including <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for maple syrup 's distinctive flavour , however its primary flavour contributing compounds are maple <unk> , strawberry <unk> , and <unk> . 
 New compounds have been identified in maple syrup , one of which is <unk> , a natural phenolic compound created when the maple sap is boiled to create syrup . 
 One author described maple syrup as " a unique ingredient , <unk> and silky @-@ textured , with a sweet , distinctive flavour – hints of caramel with overtones of toffee will not do – and a rare colour , amber set alight . Maple flavour is , well , maple flavour , uniquely different from any other . " Agriculture Canada has developed a " flavour wheel " that details 91 unique flavours that can be present in maple syrup . These flavours are divided into 13 families : vanilla , <unk> ( burnt ) , milky , fruity , floral , spicy , foreign deterioration or environment , maple , confectionery , plants forest @-@ humus @-@ cereals , herbaceous , or <unk> . These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to wine tasting . Other culinary experts praise its unique flavour . 
 Maple syrup and its various artificial imitations are widely used as toppings for pancakes , waffles , and French toast in North America . They can also be used to flavour a variety of foods , including fritters , ice cream , hot cereal , fresh fruit , and sausages . It is also used as sweetener for granola , applesauce , baked beans , candied sweet potatoes , winter squash , cakes , pies , breads , tea , coffee , and hot <unk> . Maple syrup can also be used as a replacement for honey in wine ( mead ) . 
 = = Imitations and substitutions = = 
 In Canada , maple syrup must be made entirely from maple sap , and syrup must have a density of 66 ° on the Brix scale to be marketed as maple syrup . In the United States , maple syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap , although small amounts of substances such as salt may be added . Labelling laws prohibit imitation syrups from having " maple " in their names . " Maple @-@ flavoured " syrups include maple syrup but may contain additional ingredients . " Pancake syrup " , " waffle syrup " , " table syrup " , and similarly named syrups are substitutes which are less expensive than maple syrup . In these syrups , the primary ingredient is most often high fructose corn syrup flavoured with sotolon ; they have no genuine maple content , and are usually thickened far beyond the viscosity of maple syrup . 
 Imitation syrups are generally cheaper than maple syrup , but tend to taste artificial . A 2009 Cook 's Illustrated comparison between top @-@ selling maple and imitation syrups consistently rated the real maple brands ( Maple Grove Farms , Highland <unk> , Camp Maple , Spring Tree , and Maple Gold ) above the imitation brands tested ( Eggo , Aunt Jemima , Mrs. Butterworth 's , Log Cabin , and Hungry Jack ) . In the United States , consumers generally prefer imitation syrups , likely because of the significantly lower cost . The fenugreek seed , a spice with high amounts of sotolon , can be prepared to have a maple @-@ like flavour , and is used to make a very strong commercial flavouring that is similar to maple syrup , but much less expensive ; one such syrup , <unk> , was popular during the Great Depression . 
 = = Cultural significance = = 
 Maple syrup and maple sugar were used during the American Civil War and by abolitionists in the years prior to the war because most cane sugar and molasses were produced by Southern slaves . Because of food rationing during the Second World War , people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple sugar , and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source . 
 Maple products are considered emblematic of Canada , in particular Quebec , and are frequently sold in tourist shops and airports as souvenirs from Canada . The sugar maple 's leaf has come to symbolize Canada , and is depicted on the country 's flag . Several US states , including New York , Vermont and Wisconsin , have the sugar maple as their state tree . A scene of sap collection is depicted on the Vermont state quarter , issued in 2001 .

 It has been two weeks since Sheriff Graham 's ( Jamie Dornan ) death , and the citizens of Storybrooke continue to mourn . Mr. Gold ( Robert Carlyle ) convinces Emma Swan ( Jennifer Morrison ) she ought to be sheriff , but Regina ( Lana Parrilla ) has already appointed Sidney Glass ( Giancarlo Esposito ) for the job . Henry ( Jared S. Gilmore ) suspects Regina is responsible for Graham 's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules . Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election must be held . Emma decides to run , so Regina declares Sidney Glass will as well . Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma 's benefactor , considering how dangerous it is to owe him one favor , let alone two . Regina is furious that Gold would work against her . 
 Gold 's plan was to set a fire at the Mayor 's office with Emma there , knowing her conscience would force her to save Regina and look like a hero . This goes off perfectly , making Emma the town favorite going into the debate . When she finds out that Gold did this , Emma realizes Henry might be right about evil not playing by the rules . At the debate , Sidney explains what would make him the best sheriff following Regina 's script to the letter . Emma reveals to the public that Gold set the fire , demonstrating her own honesty and integrity as well as Gold 's ruthlessness . Later that evening at Granny 's Cafe , Emma consoles herself with liquor when Henry walks in with the walkie talkies , saying that he was proud of her and they might continue " Operation Cobra . " Regina , Archie ( Raphael Sbarge ) , Mary Margaret ( Ginnifer Goodwin ) and Sidney arrive to tell Emma she was elected Sheriff . Regina gives her the badge and admits they have one thing in common : their distrust of Gold . Emma receives a visit from her new ally who reveals the rest of his plan . Gold knew Emma would do the right thing and tell everyone what he did , winning her the election . He also tells her that while the town feared Regina , they feared him more . In standing up to him , Emma became even more compelling to the townsfolk than when she rescued Regina . Now that Emma is Sheriff , Gold expects to be paid back for his favors .

 In the Enchanted Forest , Rumpelstiltskin 's ( Carlyle ) backstory is revealed . During the ogre wars , children are conscripted to military service at age 14 . The Duke 's men gather young soldiers with the help of " The Dark One " who possesses great magical power . Rumpelstiltskin 's son , Baelfire ( Dylan Schmid ) , will turn 14 in three days and he is desperate to keep his child out of battle . As father and son flee from the village , they are confronted by the Duke 's men . They mock Rumpelstiltskin for running away when he was supposed to serve , and reveal that his cowardice caused his wife to leave him . Rumpelstiltskin begs for his son 's life but he has nothing to offer but fealty . The Duke 's chief soldier commands Rumpelstiltskin to kiss his boot , but when the desperate man bends down the soldier kicks him to the ground . The old beggar ( Brad Dourif ) by the side of the road sees this and offers the pair assistance since they spared him a coin . The beggar tells Rumpelstiltskin a secret , the Duke possesses a dagger that allows him to command The Dark One and all his power . If Rumpelstiltskin steals the dagger , he will control The Dark One himself . If he kills The Dark One with the dagger , he will possess his magic . Rumpelstiltskin sets fire to the Duke 's castle ( in a parallel with Mr. Gold 's actions ) and steals the dagger which reads the name of The Dark One , " Zoso " . 
 Baelfire is worried about his father 's plan to wield the dagger 's power but Rumpelstiltskin just sends him home . Rumpelstiltskin summons Zoso and declares he is The Dark One 's master . Zoso is not impressed and wonders aloud what the timid little man would have him do . Rumpelstiltskin 's answer is " Die ! " He kills The Dark One who reveals himself to be the beggar from before . Zoso laughs and tells Rumpelstiltskin that " All magic comes with a price . " Rumpelstiltskin becomes the new Dark One and his name is now inscribed on the dagger . He returns home and uses his power to save his son from the Duke 's men . Baelfire is terrified of this man who no longer seems like his father at all .

 " Desperate Souls " was written by consulting producer Jane Espenson , while Friday Night Lights veteran Michael Waxman served as director . The episode was Espenson 's second writing credit for the series at that point . She intended the episode to reveal " some crucial facts about where <unk> comes from , " believing him to be " a wild card " whose " ulterior motives are still always very complicated . " 
 " Desperate Souls " partly deals with the aftermath of Sheriff Graham 's death from the previous episode . Though her character is associated with evil , actress Lana Parrilla attempted to keep Regina as human as possible . She clarified , " You will see how there is a genuine love and care for Graham … There was a physical connection to the character . He did become sort of a boy toy in both worlds . But , you know , at the end of the day , in Storybrooke , she ’ s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about . " Leading up to the episode broadcast , Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect . Of the episode 's plot , she explained , " We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold . You ’ re going to see how threatening that is to Regina , and , as you know , she really takes on these challenges full force . " 
 In early October 2011 , TV Guide reported that actor Brad Dourif would be making a guest appearance as a " beggar who befriends evil Rumpelstiltskin . " Other guest stars included Meghan Ory as Ruby , Patti Allan as Miss Ginger , Beverley Elliott as Granny , Giancarlo Esposito as Sidney , Dylan Schmid as Baelfire , Conner Dwelly as <unk> , Ty Olsson as <unk> , Michael <unk> as The Duke ( scenes deleted ) , C. Ernst Harth as Burly Man , David @-@ Paul Grove as Doc , and Gabe <unk> as Mr. Clark . The episode was included in Reawakened : A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013 .

 " Desperate Souls " received mostly positive reviews from television critics . 
 In her first review of the series , Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly expressed her enjoyment of the episode , believing the following week would be " pretty difficult to top tonight 's ep . " Busis praised the final fairytale scenes as " intense , effective ... [ and ] ... awesome . " IGN writer Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 7 / 10 , giving praise to Robert Carlyle and guest actor Brad Dourif , but criticizing Lana Parrilla 's constant " dagger stares and pursed lips " to Emma . Ratcliffe did however believe Ginnifer Goodwin and Joshua Dallas had " electric chemistry , " and wished viewers could see more scenes between the two . Like Ratcliffe , Digital Spy columnist Catriona Wightman lauded Parrilla and Carlyle 's performances , believing the latter " continues to be one of the best things about Once Upon A Time - this completely new version of Rumpelstiltskin we saw was illuminating . Turns out he does cowardly and pathetic quite well . " 
 The Huffington Post editor Laura Prudom and TV Fanatic 's C. Orlando also highlighted Carlyle 's acting and storyline . Prudom liked Dourif 's casting , but singled out praise for Mary Margaret and David 's poster scene , calling it " beautifully written and played , understated and filled with longing . " The A.V. Club 's Oliver Sava was more critical of the episode , and graded " Desperate Souls " with a C. He remarked that Once Upon a Time " lacks Lost 's sophistication and insight , instead laying out plot in the plainest terms possible , no matter how tedious that may be ... It hasn ’ t even been ten episodes , and the formula is already starting to feel stale . " Despite this , Sava saw potential for the series , noting that " the writers just need to take fuller advantage of the wealth of mythology that the fairy tale stories give them . "

 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate a series of lightning @-@ related deaths in Oklahoma , which are eventually connected to the only person to have survived a lightning strike , an emotionally charged youth . 
 The original concept for the episode was a one line concept card stating " Lightning Boy " that had been tacked to a board in series creator Chris Carter 's office since the first season . The episode contained several scenes of elaborate lightning effects . Notably , a " lightning machine " used for the sequence where Darin is struck by lightning was created by Special Effects Supervisor David Gauthier and buried under the ground .

 At a video arcade in <unk> , Oklahoma , two young men , Jack Hammond and Darin Peter Oswald , argue over a game of Virtua Fighter 2 . Hammond pushes Oswald to the ground , after which the power in the arcade mysteriously shuts down — except to a jukebox , which plays " Ring the Bells " by James . This makes Hammond nervous and he leaves , but when he goes outside to start his car , he finds the same song playing on the radio . He is then fatally electrocuted through the ignition . Oswald , who witnesses Hammond 's death , returns to the game . 
 Fox Mulder and Dana Scully arrive in <unk> , where Hammond is the latest of five men who have died due to lightning @-@ related causes . Upon visiting the arcade , Scully talks to Bart " Zero " <unk> , the arcade owner ( and a friend of Oswald 's ) who happened to be present the night Hammond died . Mulder finds Oswald 's high scores on the game 's display , realizing that he was playing the game on the night Hammond died ; Oswald was the first of the victims , and the only one to have survived . Elsewhere , Oswald is at work at an automobile repair shop , when his boss 's wife walks in and he <unk> her without her noticing . He then tries talking to her , but she nervously rebuffs him ; it is revealed that he had hit on her the day before , and she turned him down . His boss returns and tells Oswald that Mulder and Scully want to talk with him . When the agents visit Oswald to question him , he claims to have not witnessed anything . However , Mulder 's cell phone mysteriously overheats in Oswald 's presence , to which Oswald acts unsurprised . 
 Alarmed by the FBI 's presence , Zero visits Oswald at his home that night ; a drunk and rowdy Oswald dismisses Zero 's worries and summons lightning to strike down nearby cattle . The lightning strikes him instead , but he appears unharmed . The next day , the agents visit the scene and find a melted shoe print in the ground , linking it to Oswald . Meanwhile , Oswald uses his abilities to manipulate local traffic lights , causing a car accident . The agents visit Oswald 's home and find a cut @-@ out picture of Sharon <unk> , Oswald 's former high school teacher and current boss 's wife , inside a porn magazine . 
 At the scene of the car accident , Oswald 's boss suffers an oddly timed heart attack ; Oswald then saves his boss by using his electrical powers as a makeshift defibrillator , much to the paramedics ' surprise . The agents question Sharon at the hospital , who claims that he told her about his powers . The agents also go through Oswald 's medical records , showing that he exhibited acute hypokalemia — electrolytic imbalance in his blood . Oswald is brought in for questioning by the agents , but he proclaims his innocence and is eventually released by the skeptical , unfriendly local sheriff , much to the agents ' dismay . Later , at the arcade , Zero is closing down for the night , and turns off the power . However , the Virtua Fighter 2 machine does not turn off . When Zero goes to investigate , the machine shuts off , except for the jukebox next to him ( playing " Hey Man , Nice Shot " , a song Oswald was listening to earlier ) . Knowing Oswald is now hunting him , Zero runs outside and claims he did not betray Oswald to the agents ; he is then suddenly struck by lightning and dies . It is then revealed that Oswald is standing on the arcade rooftop .. 
 After learning of Oswald 's release , the agents rush to the hospital to protect the <unk> , but the power goes out when they arrive . Oswald confronts Scully and Sharon , and the latter fearfully agrees to leave with him in return for her husband 's safety . The sheriff arrives and tries to stop him . While pursuing a fleeing Sharon , Oswald summons lightning but ends up striking himself once again and , in the process , kills the sheriff . Oswald is put in a psychiatric hospital , although the local district attorney has no idea how they will be able to prosecute him . As the agents observe Oswald , he uses his powers to change the channels of the TV in his room .

 The original concept for the episode was a one line concept card stating " Lightning Boy " that had been tacked to a board in series creator Chris Carter 's office since the first season . Carter 's idea was solely about a boy who could control lightning , and the concept wasn 't fleshed out into an episode until the third season . Writer Howard Gordon stated that the key moment in the episode 's conception came when he decided to use the boy 's power as a metaphor for disenfranchised adolescence . Gordon described the episode 's concept as " Beavis and Butt @-@ head electrified " . Gordon claimed that the episode suffered conceptually having come directly after a trilogy of mythology episodes . Story editor Frank Spotnitz claims that there were originally ideas on incorporating some of the events from that trilogy into this episode , but those ideas were eventually scrapped due to the producer 's desire for each episode to be able to have its own integrity and stand alone . Spotnitz said the episode was a risky one to do for a show with an adult audience due to the high school setting and the fact that the episode was about adolescence and violent impulses when one is a kid . 
 The sheriff , Teller , was named after Teller from the illusion and comedy duo Penn and Teller . The pair had wanted to appear on an episode of the show , but when Chris Carter could find no way to work them into the show this reference was added instead . The Astadourian Lightning Observatory was named after Mary Astadourian , Chris Carter 's executive assistant . Darin Oswald was named after writer Darin Morgan . 
 Giovanni Ribisi won the part as Darin after some coaching from casting director Rick Millikan after Ribisi 's initial audition failed to provide what Chris Carter was looking for . Spotnitz described Ribisi 's performance as " really , really good " . Director Kim Manners ' best friend was killed during the third day of shooting . There was consideration on replacing him with another director for the episode but at his insistence he completed the episode . 
 A " lightning machine " used for the sequence where Darin is struck by lightning was created by special effects supervisor David Gauthier and buried under the ground . Giovanni Ribisi stood on a stand with the device rigged underneath him . Mirrors were used to establish the effect of the lightning flaring up and outward , and were augmented by sparks and smoke . A special anti @-@ fire product was applied to the costumes of the actors hit by lightning . Art Director Graeme Murray states that the biggest construction event in the episode was the scene where Darin manipulated the traffic lights . The producers had to plant telephone poles and build a billboard for the scene . Murray tried to make the psychiatric ward in the episode 's closure not resemble the one from season 2 's " Soft Light " , to avert repetition despite the similar ending . The farmhouse used for Darin 's home , situated in Albion , British Columbia , was owned by a 94 @-@ year @-@ old man and also used for the movies Jumanji and Jennifer Eight . The producers had difficulty obtaining permission to use a dead cow in the episode due to concerns over animal rights groups . When the fake cow created failed to look realistic enough , the producers were able to use a dead cow obtained from a slaughterhouse for the episode .

 Wale had wanted to collaborate with Lady Gaga on the track since January 2009 , believing that she embodied the party @-@ record feel of the song . He explained : " If music was a high school , I feel like I 'll be the dude on the football team , and it would be like , ' OK , Gaga 's having a party ! ' And you know all the bad girls are going to be out there . " Upon hearing that some were surprised by the collaboration , Wale went on to say , " If Jay @-@ Z can work with Coldplay , then Wale should be able to work with Gaga . " Wale 's mentor , Mark Ronson , sent the track to Gaga . She commented that her portion of the song , which includes lyrics such as " Lookin ' at , lookin ' at , lookin ' at me / Eyes all <unk> ' like honey on bees " , is narcissistic , but in a positive way . The lyrics capture the life and image of Wale 's home areas Maryland and District of Columbia . About incorporating the hook in the song , Gaga said : 
 I really wanted to sit down with Wale before I wrote the hook , because to me , it 's really lame when people send you tracks , and they 're like , ' All right , Gaga , throw your vocals on it . ' This is Wale 's record . It 's not my record . It 's one of those songs , one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can 't stop listening to .

 Along with Wale and Gaga , songwriters who worked on " Chillin " included Gary De Carlo , Dale <unk> , Roy C Hammond , Paul Leka , Andre Christopher Lyon , Makeba Riddick , Kirk Robinson and Marcello Valenzano . " Chillin " has influence of 1990s style rapping , and samples from the 1969 song " Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye " by Steam , and the 1987 song " Top Billin ' " by Audio Two . The song is written in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 100 beats per minute , and is composed in the key of G minor . Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club called it a " throwback slab of electro @-@ funk " , with robotic new wave inspired vocals by Gaga . After starting with the Steam sample , the song has a stripped @-@ down beat with a bass drum and synth @-@ claps , and synthesizers on the verses and the sample being looped in the chorus , with Gaga interjecting her verses in @-@ between . Lyrically it has Wale 's name repeated throughout and the rapper talking about things he has in comparison to other people , opening with the line " This how you start off ' 09 , kickin ' in the door and I 'm everybody 's problem " . He also refers to fellow rapper M.I.A. with the line " I 'm the same way , M.I.A. / Me , Cool and Dre get high like planes " . 
 Produced by Cool & Dre , the song was recorded at Allido Sound Studios in New York , by Derek <unk> , while the mixing was done by Serban <unk> . Wale recalled in a 2011 interview with MTV News for Lady Gaga : Inside the Outside special , that the recording session did not go easy . He had traveled to the New York recording studio from Washington D.C. after a long night of partying . Gaga was already in the studio in her exuberant style with a big ribbon atop her head by which Wale was taken aback , and was a " cultural difference " for him . In an effort to warm up to each other they made small talk about their respective record deals with Interscope . By the end of the session , Gaga had created five different hooks for " Chillin " and added her vocals on the track . The rapper added , " It took a while . Once we finally got the ball rolling , it was almost time to go . It was natural though . It 's wack when you get in the studio with somebody and it 's automatically music time — it feels fake . We were trying to feel each other out . " Wale later added that he would like to collaborate with Gaga again on a track but it was unknown to him if Gaga would be interested .

 The music video for the song was directed by Chris Robinson and was posted on Interscope 's YouTube channel on the June 12 , 2009 . It features guest appearances from rappers Young Chris , Tre , Pusha T , <unk> Glover and Bun B .. The video shows Wale and Gaga at the District of Columbia 's Cardozo Senior High School and Wale in various venues and streets in the District , including South Boston Waterfront . This includes one scene in the famous hidden clothing store Bodega in Boston where Wale tries on various clothes . One of Gaga 's characteristic Great Danes , which had also previously appeared in the music videos for " Just Dance " and " Poker Face " , appears in the video for " Chillin " , wearing Beats by Dr. Dre headphones . Several posters of Barack Obama appear in the video . The music video was added to BET 's TV rotation . Chrissy Andrews from MuchMusic complimented Gaga 's appearance in the music video , saying that " this is the most ' toned down ' I 've ever seen Lady Gaga . She 's wearing a short dress with pumps , but she 's surprisingly without her facial lightning bolt , crystal staff or orbiting head piece ( as seen on her Ellen appearance ) . One of the two massive dogs from her other videos does make an appearance , however ... with headphones on ! Even without all of the crazy things we know Gaga for , she 's still great in this video .

 " Chillin " received mixed reviews from critics . Steve Roberts from MTV praised Gaga 's verse and for employing a similar singing style to M.I.A .. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard complimented the " club @-@ ready single " for its " bouncy hook and slick verses " and called the song " the perfect precursor to Wale 's long @-@ awaited debut " . Mehan Jayasuriya from PopMatters commended the song for being a " token party jam " on the album track list . She added that " for all the flack that the [ track ] has caught , it 's still an indisputably catchy song , even if the 9th Wonder and Nick <unk> reworking from [ Wale 's ] Back to the Feature stands as the definitive version . " Andres <unk> from HipHopDX believed the composition of the song as " Pop @-@ friendly " . A reviewer for XXL compared and described " Chillin " as " distinctly <unk> anthem " . David Jeffries from AllMusic praised Wale 's " natural delivery and quirky sense of humor " in the song , likening his vocals to that of Jay @-@ Z and Gaga 's vocals to that of singer Rihanna . Describing " Chillin " as a " club @-@ friendly hopper " , Chris Richards from The Washington Post believed that using Rihanna or M.I.A. on the track would have made it successful , rather than Gaga who was then considered a relatively unknown singer . Richards recalled a similar situation when Washington D.C. based go @-@ go band Experience Unlimited had collaborated with androgynous singer Grace Jones on a track . Sobhi Youssef from Sputnikmusic noticed that the song 's production made it sound like a different track than the rest of Attention Deficit . 
 New York Post critic Ryan Brockington liked the song , but questioned Gaga 's emulation of M.I.A. Mosi Reeves from Spin criticized Gaga 's " wanna @-@ be @-@ M.I.A. cadences " , calling it " unnecessarily crass " . Another review from Spin by Brandon Soderberg panned the song , saying that " [ i ] t wasn 't a Wale song and it wasn 't a Gaga song with Wale wedged in there somewhere , either . ' Chillin ' became something of an Internet rap watershed moment " . Sean Fennessey from Pitchfork Media described the song as " much @-@ maligned " , adding that " there won 't be much to gain from [ ' Chillin ' ] ... This was the first step in Wale 's multiple personality debacle and he seems to know as much — nothing else on Attention Deficit resembles the goofy sneakers @-@ shouting writing here . " In another review , Ryan Dombal from the same website criticized Wale 's repetition of his name and the usage of the samples calling it " unnecessary " . Brian Howe from Paste described the track as " flashy and hollow " . The Greyhound gave the song a negative review and believed that " with a lackluster hook and the repetition of the name ' Wale , ' the airplay and sales of this single will depend greatly upon the vocals of Lady Gaga . " Wilson McBee from Slant Magazine criticized both " Chillin " and the follow @-@ up single , " World Tour " , as " tepid Cool & Dre productions in which Wale seems to be attempting Black Eyed Peas @-@ style halftime @-@ show rap . " McBee believed that the songs did not represent the true nature of the album . Prefix magazine was also critical of the song saying that " just when you think Wale understands the consequences of mindlessly horny partying ... he gives us the dumb , cheaply agreeable Lady Gaga feature ' Chillin ' .

 The Trøndelag Commuter Rail ( Norwegian : NSB Lokaltog Trøndelag , previously Trønderbanen ) is a commuter train service operating in Nord @-@ Trøndelag and Sør @-@ Trøndelag , Norway . It is operated by Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) with Class 92 diesel multiple units . The service provides a commuter service connecting Trondheim to its suburbs , between towns in Innherred and as an airport rail link for Trondheim Airport , Værnes . Although passenger services have operated along the lines since 1864 , the commuter train was created with an increase of service with existing rolling stock in 1993 . In 2006 , the system had at least 1 @,@ 180 @,@ 000 passengers . 
 The main service operates from Lerkendal in Trondheim via Trondheim Central Station and Trondheim Airport Station to Steinkjer on the Nordland Line . The service runs every hour , with additional rush @-@ hour services , and reduced service in the evenings and on the weekend . A secondary services runs from Trondheim along the Dovre Line to Støren and along the Røros Line to Røros . The Mittnabotåget service operates twice a day from Trondheim along the Meråker Line and the Central Line in Sweden to Östersund Central Station . 
 = = Route = = 
 The main hub for the commuter system is Trondheim Central Station ( Trondheim S ) . It also serves as coach and bus station and the terminus of the intercity trains along the Dovre and Nordland Line . The service runs north @-@ eastwards through Trondheim , stopping at the stations Lademoen / Nedre Elvehavn ( which serves a mixed residential and commercial area ) , Lilleby ( which serves a residential area ) , Leangen and Rotvoll ; the latter two serve each their campus of Sør @-@ Trøndelag University College . In Malvik , the line serves two stations : <unk> and Hommelvik . After entering Stjørdal , the first station in Hell , where the Meråker Line branches off from the Nordland Line . Northwards is first Trondheim Airport , Stjørdal ( the main station to serve the town ) and Skatval . 
 After entering Levanger , the line serves the villages of Åsen , <unk> ( limited services only ) and Skogn . It then enters the town center , where there are three stations : Innherred <unk> serves Levanger Hospital , Levanger serves the town center and bus station , and HiNT Røstad serves the campus of Nord @-@ Trøndelag University College . The line then enters Verdal , where is serves the suburb at Bergsgrav before the town center at Verdal . Inderøy is served by the village station Røra , before the line enters Steinkjer , where it serves the village of Sparbu before terminating in the town center at Steinkjer . 
 South of Trondheim S , both the main service and the Røros service runs along the Dovre Line , stopping at Skansen , where there is transfer to the Trondheim Tramway , and Marienborg , located beside St. <unk> University Hospital . After Marienborg , the main service branches off along the Stavne – Leangen Line to the terminus at Lerkendal , which serves the <unk> campus of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and Lerkendal Stadion , the home ground of Rosenborg BK . 
 The Røros service continues south , making two more stops within Trondheim : <unk> and Heimdal . It continues through Melhus , where it makes five stops , one in the town center at Melhus and then in the villages of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Hovin . In <unk> <unk> , the service stops at Støren , where the Røros Line branches from the Dovre Line . The single daily service to Oppdal runs southwards , with an intermediate stop at <unk> . The Røros service continues along the Røros Line , stopping at <unk> before entering <unk> , where there are stops at <unk> and <unk> . The terminus is at Røros , where there is a transfer to regional rail services southwards . 
 Mittnabotåget start at Heimdal and operate northwards via Trondheim S to Hell , where they branch off and follow the Meråker Line . In Stjørdal , it serves Hegra before entering Meråker , where it serves the villages at Meråker and Kopperå before reaching the Swedish border at Storlien . Here the services continues along the Central Line , where stops are made at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Östersund West and Östersund Central Station .

 The operating deficits are covered through subsidies by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications . The trackage and other infrastructure is owned by the government agency Norwegian National Rail Administration , while the rolling stock is owned and operated by the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) . Rolling stock maintenance is performed by NSB @-@ owned Mantena . 
 The Trondheim – Steinkjer services operates with a fixed , hourly , headway during the day with additional rush @-@ hour services giving a half @-@ hour headway . In the evenings and weekends , there is a two @-@ hour headway . Travel time from Lerkendal to Trondheim S is 10 minutes ; from Trondheim S travel time to Trondheim Airport is 35 minutes , to Stjørdal 41 minutes , to Levanger 1 hour and 25 minutes , to Verdal 1 hour and 41 minutes and to Steinkjer 2 hours and 5 minutes . The Trondheim – Røros service is provided five times per day in each direction . From Trondheim S , travel time to Melhus is 24 minutes , to Støren 1 hour and to Røros 2 hours and 25 minutes . An single morning one @-@ direction service is offered from Oppdal to Trondheim S ; this service takes 1 hour and 45 minutes . The Mittnabotåget service to Östersund provides two round trips per day , with travel time from Trondheim S to Östersund C 3 hours and 46 minutes . This service is operated jointly between NSB and Veolia Transport .

 NSB operates fourteen Class 92 diesel @-@ electric multiple units , of which most are used for the commuter rail . They were built by Duewag in 1984 and 1985 and consist of two cars , giving a seating capacity of 168 people . A double @-@ unit is 49 @.@ 45 metres ( 162 @.@ 2 ft ) long and weights 92 tonnes ( 91 long tons ; 101 short tons ) , of which the motor car weighs 58 tonnes ( 57 long tons ; 64 short tons ) . Only the one car is powered , and is equipped with a Daimler @-@ Benz <unk> prime mover which powers two electric motors , giving a power output of 714 kilowatts ( 957 hp ) . The trains are capable of 140 kilometres per hour ( 87 mph ) and are equipped with vending machines .

 The commuter rail system serves 39 railway stations , most of which predate the commuter rail service . When the Røros , Meråker and Nordland Lines were built , stations buildings were built at all places with a passing loop , and most of these stations the buildings remain , although they are not necessarily open to travelers . However , only Trondheim , Stjørdal , Steinkjer and Røros are manned . Several of the station and operation buildings along the line have been preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage . These include the stations at <unk> , Hell , Skatval , Langstein , Skogn and Levanger . The system 's depot is located at Marienborg , although trains also overnight at terminal stations . 
 = = History = = 
 The rearrangement of the train services in Trøndelag was made in 1993 , when NSB announced the brand Trønderbanen . The concept was based on the Jæren Commuter Rail which had been established the previous year , operating between Stavanger and Egersund . The Trøndelag Commuter Rail would operate several services , north of Trondheim to Steinkjer and south to Oppdal and Tynset . The initial plans called to the continued use of the Class 92 rolling stock , but saw change in schedules and new upgraded platforms for NOK 15 million . This involved building a small platform house with a roof and glass walls , but a framework of wood , at each station . They were optimized to give good protection from various types weather . 
 The service started on 1 September 1993 . The changes to the schedule involved almost a doubling of the number of departures , particularly between Trondheim and Stjørdal , where a one @-@ hour headway was introduced . The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips . While local trains had existed previously north of Trondheim , the services south to Oppdal were all new in an area which was previously only served by intercity and night trains . The initial services consisted of four services from Trondheim — northwards along the Nordland Line to Steinkjer , east along the Meråker Line to Storlien , south along the Dovre Line to Oppdal and south @-@ east along the Røros Line to Tynset . 
 After six months operation , the service had experienced a 40 % traffic increase . On 15 November 1994 , the Trøndelag Commuter Rail became the first airport rail link in the Nordic Countries , when a new terminal and Trondheim Airport Station opened at Trondheim Airport , Værnes . NSB stated that their primary goal was not to compete with the four hourly airport coaches which operated to the hotels in Trondheim , but instead to provide services to communities in Nord @-@ Trøndelag and south of Trondheim . The investment at the airport cost NOK 24 million . 
 From January 1995 , the frequency between Steinkjer and Melhus was increased slightly . On 26 September 1995 , the train station in Trondheim reopened as a renovated station that serves both buses , coaches and trains . The investment cost NOK 50 million . In 1997 , NSB stated that the Trøndelag Commuter Rail was unprofitable and threatened to terminate it , along with an array of other services , if funding was not increased . The same year , 750 @,@ 000 people traveled with the commuter rail . The 20 % increase that year was in part due to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997 being held in Trondheim , and was the service in the country with the largest growth . 
 Following the Åsta accident on 4 January 2000 , when a Class 92 was wrecked and taken out of service , NSB announced that they would terminate two of the commuter rail services south of Støren towards Oppdal . At the same time , the company announced a reduction in the number of services from Trondheim to Steinkjer . From 11 June 2000 , all services on the Dovre Line south of Støren were terminated , leaving only intercity services . At the same year , plans by local politicians and commerce were launched to halve the travel time between Trondheim and Steinkjer , under the motto " Trondheim to Steinkjer in one hour " . NSB hoped to introduce a faster airport link , similar to the Airport Express Train in Oslo , which would allow the trains to operate from Trondheim to the airport in 20 minutes . The plans would have called for the termination of service at 17 of 21 stations and investments at about NOK 3 @.@ 7 billion . 
 In March 2000 , NSB announced that they were considering reducing the number of stations on the commuter rail from the then 31 stations to between 15 and 20 . NSB stated that 50 % of the stations were responsible for only 2 % of the traffic , and that a bus service to these areas — which would transport people to the closest railway station — would be more economic and reduce travel time for the remaining passengers . NSB also stated that they indented to re @-@ brand the service as part of the Puls brand used for the other commuter rail services . Part of the reason for the change of service was that Nord @-@ Trøndelag County Municipality had permitted TrønderBilene to double the number of services on their competing coach service along the route and the commuter rail needed to increase its speed to not lose customers to the coach . 
 From 7 January 2001 , NSB made several major changes to the commuter rail . A fixed , hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim ; including extra rush @-@ hour trains from Lerkendal to Stjørdal , giving 23 departures per day in each direction . South of Trondheim , the service was rerouted to terminate at Lerkendal . Six stations were closed : Muruvik , Solbakken , Mære , Østborg , Rinnan and Elberg . At the same time , the station at Marienborg and Røstad opened . NSB also introduced a fare zone system , which gave up to NOK 20 discount for single @-@ fare travelers and about the same fares for month @-@ pass holders . Part of the reason for the expansion was that the delivery of the new Class 93 trains for regional services freed up more Class 92 units . This also allowed NSB to operate some of services with double unit ( four @-@ car ) trains in rush @-@ hour . 
 The restructuring also called for the reduction of four services on the Meråker Line and two services to Oppdal , terminating all commuter train services on the lines . For the service to Oppdal , NSB had an operating deficit of NOK 1 @.@ 7 million and 21 @,@ 000 passengers in 1998 . The Meråker Line had about twice the number of passengers . The National Rail Administration stated that if any private companies wanted to operate the routes without subsidies , they were free to do so . As compensation , travelers between Trondheim and <unk> and Oppdal with month passes were allowed to not pay for seat reservations on the intercity services . Sør @-@ Trøndelag County Municipality applied to the ministry to take over responsibility and purchase the commuter train services , so they could continue the service to Oppdal , but this was rejected by the ministry . 
 From June 2001 , NSB introduced additional rush @-@ hour trains between Trondheim and Steinkjer , giving a half @-@ hour headway . From 22 September 2002 , NSB and the Public Transportation Authority in Jämtlands County started a cooperation that involved two daily round trips with a Class 92 trains between Trondheim and Östersund in Sweden . The trains were manned by NSB on the Norwegian side of the border , and by BK Tåg staff on the Swedish side , after the latter had won a public service obligation contract with the Swedish authority . From 16 June 2003 , NSB reintroduced commuter trains between Trondheim and Oppdal . From 1 January 2004 , the commuter rail service was reorganized . The brand Trønderbanen was abandoned and the administration was assimilated into the functional departments and partially moved to Oslo . In 2005 and 2006 , the Class 92 trains were renovated and received a new exterior and interior color . On 8 January 2007 , Lademoen / Nedre Elvehavn Station in Trondheim opened . Previously , the former station known as Lademoen was renamed Lilleby so the new station serving Nedre Elvehavn could be named Lademoen . The name @-@ change caused protests from historians and the municipal committee responsible for naming . The 4 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometer ( 2 @.@ 7 mi ) long Gevingåsen Tunnel opened on 15 August 2011 , shortening travel time between Hommelvik and Værnes by five minutes . It also allows the number of trains on the line between Trondheim and Stjørdal to increase to eight trains per hour ( both directions combined ) , which will free up sufficient capacity to allow additional commuter trains to run to Stjørdal . 
 = = Future = = 
 There are political signals to prioritize electrification the tracks from Trondheim to Steinkjer plus the Meråker Line . NSB will need to replace the rolling stock in the 2010s , and want to coordinate the new stock with electrification . 
 The National Rail Administration has stated that they may have to close Innherred <unk> Station . The station is located in a curve and within the signaling area of Levanger Station , and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate has required the station to be corrected by 2012 . Because of the adjacent Levanger Hospital , the station is one of the busiest on the system , with 90 @,@ 000 annual riders . One possible solution is to move the platforms of Levanger Station closer towards the hospital and thus serve both the town and the hospital from the same station . 
 The two county municipalities proposed during the early 2000s that the Nordland Line between Trondheim and Steinkjer be upgraded allow travel time to be reduced to one hour . This would require the average speed to be increased to 115 kilometres per hour ( 71 mph ) , mainly through a modernization of the existing line . Specific projects include electrification , double track between Trondheim and Trondheim Airport , Gevingåsen Tunnel , a 11 @.@ 3 @-@ kilometre ( 7 @.@ 0 mi ) tunnel through <unk> ( between Stjørdal and Åsen ) , additional passing loops , a new bridge over the <unk> River and a rearrangement of the tracks at Hell . This would have to be combined with a reduction in the number of stops . The National Rail Administration estimates that the mentioned investments , which would cost between NOK 4 and 6 billion , will allow a travel time of 1 hour and 10 minutes . If a number of curves are straightened , increased capacity is introduced between Stjørdal and Steinkjer and a further number of stops are removed , travel time could be reduced to 1 hour . 
 Norsk Bane , a lobbyist organisation which is suggesting to build a high @-@ speed line from Oslo to Trondheim and onwards to Steinkjer , estimates that regional trains will , with their infrastructure , be able to operate trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim in 40 minutes . The proposals involves only keeping the stations at Hommelvik , Trondheim Airport , Stjørdal , Åsen , Levanger , Verdal , Røra and Steinkjer north of Trondheim . South of Trondheim , the proposal involves a 35 @-@ minute service to Oppdal , with intermediate stops at Heimdal , Melhus , Støren and <unk> . The proposal involves building an all @-@ new double track and having a stopping pattern where not all stations are served by all services . It would involve three services per hour and direct trains to Oslo , with speeds up to 300 kilometres per hour ( 190 mph ) . 
 = Swedish emigration to the United States = 
 During the Swedish emigration to the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries , about 1 @.@ 3 million Swedes left Sweden for the United States . The main pull was the availability of low cost , high quality farm land in the upper Midwest ( the area from Illinois to Montana ) , and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago , Minneapolis , Worcester and many smaller cities . Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some . Most migration was of the chain form , with early settlers giving reports and recommendations ( and travel money ) to relatives and friends in Sweden , who followed the same route to new homes . A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands . Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures , the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden , and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church . After 1870 , transatlantic fares were cheap . By the 1880s , American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one @-@ way tickets for entire families . The railroad would ship the family , their house furnishings and farm tools , and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm over a period of years . 
 Swedish migration peaked 1870 @-@ 1900 . By 1890 , the U.S. census reported a Swedish @-@ American population of nearly 800 @,@ 000 . Many of the immigrants became classic pioneers , clearing and cultivating the prairies of the Great Plains , while others remained in the cities , particularly Chicago . Single young women usually went straight from agricultural work in the Swedish countryside to jobs as housemaids . Many established Swedish Americans visited the old country in the later 19th century , their narratives illustrating the difference in customs and manners . Some made the journey with the intention of spending their declining years in Sweden . 
 After a dip in the 1890s , emigration rose again , causing national alarm in Sweden . At this time , Sweden 's economy had developed substantially , but the higher wages prevailing in the United States retained their attractiveness . A broad @-@ based parliamentary emigration commission was instituted in 1907 . It recommended social and economic reform in order to reduce emigration by " bringing the best sides of America to Sweden " . The commission 's major proposals were rapidly implemented : universal male suffrage , better housing , general economic development , and broader popular education , measures which also can be attributed to numerous other factors . The effect of these measures on migration is hard to assess , as World War I ( 1914 – 1918 ) broke out the year after the commission published its last volume , reducing emigration to a mere trickle . From the mid @-@ 1920s , there was no longer a Swedish mass emigration . 
 = = Early history : the Swedish @-@ American dream = = 
 The Swedish West India Company established a colony on the Delaware River in 1638 , naming it New Sweden . A small , short @-@ lived colonial settlement , New Sweden contained at its height only some 600 Swedish and Finnish settlers ( Finland being part of Sweden ) . It was lost to the Dutch in New Netherland in 1655 . Nevertheless , the descendants of the original colonists maintained spoken Swedish until the late 18th century . Modern day reminders of the history of New Sweden are reflected in the presence of the American Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia , Fort Christina State Park in Wilmington , Delaware , and The <unk> in Essington , Pennsylvania . 
 The historian H. A. Barton has suggested that the greatest significance of New Sweden was the strong and long @-@ lasting interest in America that the colony generated in Sweden . America was seen as the standard @-@ bearer of liberalism and personal freedom , and became an ideal for liberal Swedes . Their admiration for America was combined with the notion of a past Swedish Golden Age with ancient Nordic ideals . Supposedly corrupted by foreign influences , the timeless " Swedish values " would be recovered by Swedes in the New World . This remained a fundamental theme of Swedish , and later Swedish @-@ American , discussion of America , though the recommended " timeless " values changed over time . In the 17th and 18th centuries , Swedes who called for greater religious freedom would often refer to America as the supreme symbol of it . The emphasis shifted from religion to politics in the 19th century , when liberal citizens of the hierarchic Swedish class society looked with admiration to the American Republicanism and civil rights . In the early 20th century , the Swedish @-@ American dream even embraced the idea of a welfare state responsible for the well @-@ being of all its citizens . Underneath these shifting ideas ran from the start the current which carried all before it in the later 20th century : America as the symbol and dream of unfettered individualism . 
 Swedish debate about America remained mostly theoretical before the 19th century , since very few Swedes had any personal experience of the nation . Emigration was illegal and population was seen as the wealth of nations . However , the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850 , and as population growth outstripped economic development , it gave rise to fears of overpopulation based on the influential population theory of Thomas Malthus . In the 1830s , the laws against emigration were repealed . 
 = = 19th century = = 
 <unk> argues that hard times in Sweden before 1867 produced a strong push effect , but that for cultural reasons most Swedes refused to emigrate and clung on at home . <unk> says the state wanted to keep its population high and : 
 The upper classes ' need for a cheap and plentiful labor force , the instinctive willingness of the clergy of the state church to discourage emigration on both moral and social grounds , and the deference of the lower orders to the arcade of powers that hovered above them — all these things formed an architecture of cultural hesitancy concerning emigration . 
 A few " countercultural " deviants from the mainstream did leave and showed the way . The severe economic hardship of the " Great Deprivation " of 1867 to 1869 , finally overcame the reluctance and the floodgates opened to produce an " emigration culture " " 
 = = = European mass emigration : push and pull = = = 
 Large @-@ scale European emigration to the United States started in the 1840s in Britain , Ireland and Germany . That was followed by a rising wave after 1850 from most Northern European countries , and in turn by Central and Southern Europe . Research into the forces behind this European mass emigration has relied on sophisticated statistical methods . One theory which has gained wide acceptance is Jerome 's analysis in 1926 of the " push and pull " factors — the impulses to emigration generated by conditions in Europe and the U.S. respectively . Jerome found that fluctuations in emigration co @-@ varied more with economic developments in the U.S. than in Europe , and deduced that the pull was stronger than the push . Jerome 's conclusions have been challenged , but still form the basis of much work on the subject . 
 Emigration patterns in the Nordic countries — Finland , Sweden , Norway , Denmark , and Iceland — show striking variation . Nordic mass emigration started in Norway , which also retained the highest rate throughout the century . Sweden got underway in the early 1840s , and had the third @-@ highest rate in all of Europe , after Ireland and Norway . Denmark had a consistently low rate of emigration , while Iceland had a late start but soon reached levels comparable to Norway . Finland , whose mass emigration did not start until the late 1880s , and at the time part of the Russian Empire , is usually classified as part of the Eastern European wave .

 The first European emigrants travelled in the holds of sailing cargo ships . With the advent of the age of steam , an efficient transatlantic passenger transport mechanism was established at the end of the 1860s . It was based on huge ocean liners run by international shipping lines , most prominently Cunard , White Star , and Inman . The speed and capacity of the large steamships meant that tickets became cheaper . From the Swedish port towns of Stockholm , Malmö and Gothenburg , transport companies operated various routes , some of them with complex early stages and consequently a long and trying journey on the road and at sea . Thus North German transport agencies relied on the regular Stockholm — Lübeck steamship service to bring Swedish emigrants to Lübeck , and from there on German train services to take them to Hamburg or Bremen . There they would board ships to the British ports of Southampton and Liverpool and change to one of the great transatlantic liners bound for New York . The majority of Swedish emigrants , however , travelled from Gothenburg to Hull , UK , on dedicated boats run by the Wilson Line , then by train across Britain to Liverpool and the big ships . 
 During the later 19th century , the major shipping lines financed Swedish emigrant agents and paid for the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda . Much of this promotional material , such as leaflets , was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class , which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country . It was a Swedish 19th @-@ century cliché to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro @-@ emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration , but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors . Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull . They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration . While the companies remain unwilling , as of 2007 , to open their archives to researchers , the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s , but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price @-@ fixing . On the other hand , H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890 , encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate . The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World , as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company . Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished , and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual . Newspaper advertising , while very common , tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content . 
 = = = Mid @-@ 19th century = = = 
 Swedish mass migration took off in the spring of 1841 with the departure of Uppsala University graduate Gustaf Unonius ( 1810 – 1902 ) together with his wife , a maid , and two students . This small group founded a settlement they named New Upsala in Waukesha County , Wisconsin , and began to clear the wilderness , full of enthusiasm for frontier life in " one of the most beautiful valleys the world can offer " . After moving to Chicago , Unonius soon became disillusioned with life in the U.S. , but his reports in praise of the simple and virtuous pioneer life , published in the liberal newspaper Aftonbladet , had already begun to draw Swedes westward . 
 The rising Swedish exodus was caused by economic , political , and religious conditions affecting particularly the rural population . Europe was in the grip of an economic depression . In Sweden , population growth and repeated crop failures were making it increasingly difficult to make a living from the tiny land plots on which at least three quarters of the inhabitants depended . Rural conditions were especially bleak in the stony and unforgiving Småland province , which became the heartland of emigration . The American Midwest was an agricultural antipode to Småland , for it , Unonius reported in 1842 , " more closely than any other country in the world approaches the ideal which nature seems to have intended for the happiness and comfort of humanity . " Prairie land in the Midwest was ample , loamy , and government @-@ owned . From 1841 it was sold to squatters for $ 1 @.@ 25 per acre , ( $ 29 per acre ( $ 72 / ha ) as of 2016 ) , following the <unk> Act of 1841 ( later replaced by the Homestead Act ) . The inexpensive and fertile land of Illinois , Iowa , Minnesota and Wisconsin was irresistible to landless and impoverished European peasants . It also attracted more well @-@ established farmers . 
 The political freedom of the American republic exerted a similar pull . Swedish peasants were some of the most literate in Europe , and consequently had access to the European egalitarian and radical ideas that culminated in the Revolutions of 1848 . The clash between Swedish liberalism and a repressive monarchist regime raised political awareness among the disadvantaged , many of whom looked to the U.S. to realize their republican ideals . 
 Dissenting religious practitioners also widely resented the treatment they received from the Lutheran State Church through the Conventicle Act . Conflicts between local worshipers and the new churches were most explosive in the countryside , where dissenting pietist groups were more active , and were more directly under the eye of local law enforcement and the parish priest . Before non @-@ Lutheran churches were granted toleration in 1809 , <unk> on illegal forms of worship and teaching often provoked whole groups of <unk> to leave together , intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land . The largest contingent of such dissenters , 1 @,@ 500 followers of Eric Jansson , left in the late 1840s and founded a community in Bishop Hill , Illinois . 
 The first Swedish emigrant guidebook was published as early as 1841 , the year Unonius left , and nine handbooks were published between 1849 and 1855 . Substantial groups of lumberjacks and iron miners were recruited directly by company agents in Sweden . Agents recruiting construction builders for American railroads also appeared , the first in 1854 , scouting for the Illinois Central Railroad . 
 The Swedish establishment disapproved intensely of emigration . Seen as depleting the labor force and as a defiant act among the lower orders , emigration alarmed both the spiritual and the secular authorities . Many emigrant diaries and memoirs feature an emblematic early scene in which the local clergy warns travellers against risking their souls among foreign heretics . The conservative press described emigrants as lacking in patriotism and moral fibre : " No workers are more lazy , immoral and indifferent than those who immigrate to other places . " Emigration was denounced as an unreasoning " mania " or " craze " , implanted in an ignorant populace by " outside agents " . The liberal press retorted that the " lackeys of monarchism " failed to take into account the miserable conditions in the Swedish countryside and the backwardness of Swedish economic and political institutions . " Yes , emigration is indeed a ' mania ' " , wrote the liberal Göteborgs <unk> och <unk> sarcastically , " The mania of wanting to eat one 's fill after one has worked oneself hungry ! The craze of wanting to support oneself and one 's family in an honest manner ! " 
 The great Famine of 1866 – 68 , and the distrust and discontent concerning the way the establishment distributed the relief help , is estimated to have contributed greatly to the raising Swedish emigration to the United States . 
 = = = Late 19th century = = = 
 Swedish emigration to the United States reached its height in the 1870 @-@ 1900 era . The size of the Swedish @-@ American community in 1865 is estimated at 25 @,@ 000 people , a figure soon to be surpassed by the yearly Swedish immigration . By 1890 the U.S. census reported a Swedish @-@ American population of nearly 800 @,@ 000 , with immigration peaking in 1869 and again in 1887 . Most of this influx settled in the North . The great majority of them had been peasants in the old country , pushed away from Sweden by disastrous crop failures and pulled towards America by the cheap land resulting from the 1862 Homestead Act . Most immigrants became pioneers , clearing and cultivating the virgin land of the Midwest and extending the pre @-@ Civil War settlements further west , into Kansas and Nebraska . Once sizable Swedish farming communities had formed on the prairie , the greatest impetus for further peasant migration came through personal contacts . The iconic " America @-@ letter " to relatives and friends at home spoke directly from a position of trust and shared background , carrying immediate conviction . At the height of migration , familial America @-@ letters could lead to chain reactions which would all but depopulate some Swedish parishes , dissolving tightly knit communities which then re @-@ assembled in the Midwest . 
 Other forces worked to push the new immigrants towards the cities , particularly Chicago . According to historian H. Arnold Barton , the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped by more than half between 1865 and 1890 , which led to progressively poorer Swedes contributing a growing share of immigration ( but compare Brattne and Åkerman , see " Crossing the Atlantic " above ) . The new immigrants were increasingly younger and unmarried . With the shift from family to individual immigration came a faster and fuller Americanization , as young , single individuals with little money took whatever jobs they could get , often in cities . Large numbers even of those who had been farmers in the old country made straight for American cities and towns , living and working there at least until they had saved enough capital to marry and buy farms of their own . A growing proportion stayed in urban centers , combining emigration with the flight from the countryside which was happening in the homeland and all across Europe . 
 Single young women , a group Barton considers particularly significant , most commonly moved straight from field work in rural Sweden to jobs as live @-@ in housemaids in urban America . " Literature and tradition have preserved the often tragic image of the pioneer immigrant wife and mother " , writes Barton , " bearing her burden of hardship , deprivation and longing on the untamed frontier ... More characteristic among the newer arrivals , however , was the young , unmarried woman ... As domestic servants in America , they ... were treated as members of the families they worked for and like ' ladies ' by American men , who showed them a courtesy and consideration to which they were quite unaccustomed at home . " They found employment easily , as Scandinavian maids were in high demand , and learned the language and customs quickly . In contrast , newly arrived Swedish men were often employed in all @-@ Swedish work gangs . The young women usually married Swedish men , and brought with them in marriage an enthusiasm for ladylike , American manners and middle @-@ class refinements . Many admiring remarks are recorded from the late 19th century about the sophistication and elegance that simple Swedish farm girls would gain in a few years , and about their unmistakably American demeanor . 
 As ready workers , the Swedes were generally welcomed by the Americans , who often singled them out as the " best " immigrants . There was no significant anti @-@ Swedish nativism of the sort that attacked Irish , German and , especially , Chinese newcomers . The Swedish style was more familiar : " They are not peddlers , nor organ grinders , nor beggars ; they do not sell ready @-@ made clothing nor keep pawn shops " , wrote the Congregational missionary M. W. Montgomery in 1885 ; " they do not seek the shelter of the American flag merely to introduce and foster among us ... socialism , nihilism , communism ... they are more like Americans than are any other foreign peoples . " 
 A number of well @-@ established and longtime Swedish Americans visited Sweden in the 1870s , making comments that give historians a window on the cultural contrasts involved . A group from Chicago made the journey in an effort to <unk> and spend their later years in the country of their birth , but changed their minds when faced with the realities of 19th @-@ century Swedish society . Uncomfortable with what they described as the social snobbery , pervasive drunkenness , and superficial religious life of the old country , they returned promptly to America . The most notable visitor was Hans Mattson ( 1832 – 1893 ) , an early Minnesota settler who had served as a colonel in the Union Army and had been Minnesota 's secretary of state . He visited Sweden in 1868 – 69 to recruit settlers on behalf of the Minnesota Immigration Board , and again in the 1870s to recruit for the Northern Pacific Railroad . Viewing Swedish class snobbery with indignation , Mattson wrote in his Reminiscences that this contrast was the key to the greatness of America , where " labor is respected , while in most other countries it is looked down upon with slight " . He was sardonically amused by the ancient pageantry of monarchy at the ceremonial opening of the Riksdag : " With all respects for old Swedish customs and manners , I cannot but compare this pageant to a great American circus — minus the menagerie , of course . " 
 Mattson 's first recruiting visit came immediately after consecutive seasons of crop failure in 1867 and 1868 , and he found himself " besieged by people who wished to accompany me back to America . " He noted that : 
 the laboring and middle classes already at that time had a pretty correct idea of America , and the fate that awaited emigrants there ; but the ignorance , prejudice and hatred toward America and everything pertaining to it among the aristocracy , and especially the office holders , was as unpardonable as it was ridiculous . It was claimed by them that all was humbug in America , that it was the paradise of scoundrels , cheats , and rascals , and that nothing good could possibly come out of it . 
 A more recent American immigrant , Ernst <unk> , who visited Sweden in 1885 , received the same galling impression of upper @-@ class arrogance and anti @-@ Americanism . The laboring classes , in their turn , appeared to him coarse and degraded , drinking heavily in public , speaking in a stream of curses , making obscene jokes in front of women and children . <unk> felt surrounded by " arrogance on one side and <unk> on the other , a manifest scorn for menial labor , a desire to appear to be more than one was " . This traveller too was incessantly hearing American civilization and culture denigrated from the depths of upper @-@ class Swedish prejudice : " If I , in all modesty , told something about America , it could happen that in reply I was informed that this could not possibly be so or that the matter was better understood in Sweden . " 
 Swedish emigration dropped dramatically after 1890 ; return migration rose as conditions in Sweden improved . Sweden underwent a rapid industrialization within a few years in the 1890s , and wages rose , principally in the fields of mining , forestry , and agriculture . The pull from the U.S. declined even more sharply than the Swedish " push " , as the best farmland was taken . No longer growing but instead settling and consolidating , the Swedish @-@ American community seemed set to become ever more American and less Swedish . The new century , however , saw a new influx . 
 = = = Religious confusion = = = 
 In the 1800s @-@ 1900s the Church of Sweden supported the Swedish government by opposing both emigration and preachers ' efforts recommending sobriety ( alcoholic beverages are sold in Sweden by a government monopoly ) . This escalated to a point where its ministers even were persecuted by the church for preaching sobriety , and the reactions of many congregation members to that contributed to an inspiration to leave the country ( which however was against the law until 1840 ) .

 = = = Parliamentary Emigration Commission 1907 – 1913 = = = 
 Emigration rose again at the turn of the 20th century , reaching a new peak of about 35 @,@ 000 Swedes in 1903 . Figures remained high until World War I , alarming both conservative Swedes , who saw emigration as a challenge to national solidarity , and liberals , who feared the disappearance of the labor force necessary for economic development . One @-@ fourth of all Swedes had made the United States their home , and a broad national consensus mandated that a Parliamentary Emigration Commission study the problem in 1907 . Approaching the task with what Barton calls " characteristic Swedish thoroughness " , the Commission published its findings and proposals in 21 large volumes . The Commission rejected conservative proposals for legal restrictions on emigration and in the end supported the liberal line of " bringing the best sides of America to Sweden " through social and economic reform . Topping the list of urgent reforms were universal male suffrage , better housing , and general economic development . The Commission especially hoped that broader popular education would counteract " class and caste differences " 
 Class inequality in Swedish society was a strong and recurring theme in the Commission 's findings . It appeared as a major motivator in the 289 personal narratives included in the report . These documents , of great research value and human interest today , were submitted by Swedes in Canada and the U.S. in response to requests in Swedish @-@ American newspapers . The great majority of replies expressed enthusiasm for their new homeland and criticized conditions in Sweden . Bitter experiences of Swedish class snobbery still rankled after sometimes 40 – 50 years in America . Writers recalled the hard work , pitiful wages , and grim poverty of life in the Swedish countryside . One woman wrote from North Dakota of how in her Värmland home parish , she had had to earn her living in peasant households from the age of eight , starting work at four in the morning and living on " rotten herring and potatoes , served out in small amounts so that I would not eat myself sick " . She could see " no hope of saving anything in case of illness " , but rather could see " the poorhouse waiting for me in the distance " . When she was seventeen , her emigrated brothers sent her a prepaid ticket to America , and " the hour of freedom struck " 
 A year after the Commission published its last volume , World War I began and reduced emigration to a mere trickle . From the 1920s , there was no longer a Swedish mass emigration . The influence of the ambitious Emigration Commission in solving the problem is still a matter of debate . Franklin D. Scott has argued in an influential essay that the American Immigration Act of 1924 was the effective cause . Barton , by contrast , points to the rapid implementation of essentially all the Commission 's recommendations , from industrialization to an array of social reforms . He maintains that its findings " must have had a powerful cumulative effect upon Sweden 's leadership and broader public opinion " . 
 = = Swedish Americans = = 
 The Midwest remained the heartland of the Swedish @-@ American community , but its position weakened in the 20th century : in 1910 , 54 % of the Swedish immigrants and their children lived in the Midwest , 15 % in industrial areas in the East , and 10 % on the West Coast . Chicago was effectively the Swedish @-@ American capital , accommodating about 10 % of all Swedish Americans — more than 100 @,@ 000 people — making it the second @-@ largest Swedish city in the world ( only Stockholm had more Swedish inhabitants ) . 
 Defining themselves as both Swedish and American , the Swedish @-@ American community retained a fascination for the old country and their relationship to it . The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century , and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish @-@ American publishing companies . The accounts testify to complex feelings , but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women . It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest . 
 In the 2000 U.S. Census , about four million Americans claimed to have Swedish roots . Minnesota remains by a wide margin the state with the most inhabitants of Swedish descent — 9 @.@ 6 % of the population as of 2005 . 
 = = = Memory = = = 
 The best @-@ known artistic representation of the Swedish mass migration is the epic four @-@ novel suite The Emigrants ( 1949 – 1959 ) by Vilhelm Moberg ( 1898 – 1973 ) . Portraying the lives of an emigrant family through several generations , the novels have sold nearly two million copies in Sweden and have been translated into more than twenty languages . The tetralogy has been filmed by Jan Troell as The Emigrants ( 1971 ) and The New Land ( 1972 ) , and forms the basis of Kristina from <unk> , a 1995 musical by former ABBA members Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus . 
 In Sweden , the Småland city of Växjö is home to the Swedish Emigrant Institute ( Svenska <unk> ) , founded in 1965 " to preserve records , interviews , and memorabilia relating to the period of major Swedish emigration between 1846 and 1930 " . The House of the Emigrants ( <unk> Hus ) was founded in Gothenburg , the main port for Swedish emigrants , in 2004 . The centre shows exhibitions on migration and has a research hall for genealogy . In the U.S. , there are hundreds of active Swedish @-@ American organizations as of 2007 , for which the Swedish Council of America functions as an umbrella group . There are Swedish @-@ American museums in Philadelphia , Chicago , Minneapolis , and Seattle . Rural cemeteries such as the Moline Swedish Lutheran Cemetery in central Texas also serve as a valuable record of the first Swedish people to come to America . 
 = Uttarakhand = 
 Uttarakhand ( / <unk> / ) , ( Hindi : उत ् <unk> ् ड , <unk> ) , formerly known as Uttaranchal , is a state in the northern part of India . It is often referred to as the <unk> ( literally : " Land of the Gods " ) due to many Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres found throughout the state . Uttarakhand is known for its natural beauty of the Himalayas , the <unk> and the Terai . On 9 November 2000 , this 27th state of the Republic of India was created from the Himalayan and adjoining northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh . It borders Tibet Autonomous Region of the People 's Republic of China on the north ; the Mahakali Zone of the Far @-@ Western Region , Nepal on the east ; and the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh to the west and north @-@ west as well as Haryana to its south @-@ western corner . The state is divided into two divisions , Garhwal and Kumaon , with a total of 13 districts . The interim capital of Uttarakhand is Dehradun , the largest city in the region , which is a railhead . The High Court of the state is in Nainital . 
 Archaeological evidence support the existence of humans in the region since prehistoric times . The region formed a part of the Kuru and the Panchal kingdoms ( <unk> ) during the Vedic age of ancient India . Among the first major dynasties of Kumaon were the Kunindas in the 2nd century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism . Ashokan edicts at <unk> show the early presence of Buddhism in this region . During the medieval period the region was consolidated under the Kumaon Kingdom and Garhwal Kingdom . In 1816 most of modern Uttarakhand was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli . Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals , the proximity of different neighbouring ethnic groups and the inseparable and complementary nature of their geography , economy , culture , language , and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions which further strengthened during the Uttarakhand movement for statehood in the 1990s . 
 The natives of the state are generally called Uttarakhandi or more specifically either Garhwali or Kumaoni depending on their place of origin . According to the 2011 Census of India , Uttarakhand has a population of 10 @,@ 116 @,@ 752 , making it the 19th most populous state in India . A large portion of the population consists of Rajputs and Brahmins . About 83 % of the population follow Hinduism . Islam is the second largest majority religion in the state , followed by the Minority Sikhism & Micro @-@ Minority Christianity , Buddhism , and Jainism . Garhwali and Kumaoni along with other hilly dialects and sub @-@ dialects are the main regional languages , whereas Hindi is the most widely spoken language . Uttarakhand is the only state in India with Sanskrit as one of its official languages . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Uttarakhand 's name is derived from the Sanskrit words <unk> ( उत ् <unk> ) meaning ' north ' , and <unk> ( <unk> ् ड ) meaning ' land ' , altogether simply meaning ' Northern Land ' . The name finds mention in early Hindu scriptures as the combined region of " <unk> " ( present day Garhwal ) and " <unk> " ( present day Kumaon ) . Uttarakhand was also the ancient Puranic ( <unk> ) term for the central stretch of the Indian Himalayas . 
 However , the region was given the name Uttaranchal by the Bharatiya Janata Party led central government and Uttar Pradesh state government when they started a new round of state reorganisation in 1998 . Chosen for its allegedly less separatist connotations , the name change generated enormous controversy among many activists for a separate state who saw it as a political act . The name Uttarakhand remained popular in the region , even while Uttaranchal was promulgated through official usage . 
 In August 2006 , India 's Union Cabinet assented to the demands of the Uttaranchal state assembly and leading members of the Uttarakhand statehood movement to rename Uttaranchal state as Uttarakhand . Legislation to that effect was passed by the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly in October 2006 , and the Union Cabinet brought in the bill in the winter session of Parliament . The bill was passed by Parliament and signed into law by then President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam in December 2006 , and since January 1 , 2007 the state is known as Uttarakhand .
