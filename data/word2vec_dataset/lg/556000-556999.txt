 Steady losses had occurred throughout their participation in the battle . On 18 August , known as the Hardest Day because both sides suffered heavy losses , the Stuka was withdrawn after 16 were destroyed and many others damaged . According to the <unk> der Luftwaffe , 59 Stukas had been destroyed and 33 damaged to varying degrees in six weeks of operations . Over 20 % of the total Stuka strength had been lost between 8 and 18 August ; and the myth of the Stuka shattered . The Ju 87s did succeed in sinking six warships , 14 merchant ships , badly damaging seven airfields and three Chain Home radar stations , and destroying 49 British aircraft , mainly on the ground . 
 On 19 August , the units of VIII . Fliegerkorps moved up from their bases around Cherbourg @-@ <unk> and concentrated in the Pas de Calais under Luftflotte 2 , closer to the area of the proposed invasion of Britain . On 13 September , the Luftwaffe targeted airfields again , with a small number of Ju 87s crossing the coast at Selsey and heading for Tangmere . After a lull , anti @-@ shipping operations attacks were resumed by some Ju 87 units from 1 November 1940 , as part of the new winter tactic of enforcing a blockade . Over the next 10 days , seven merchant ships were sunk or damaged , mainly in the Thames Estuary , for the loss of four Ju 87s . On 14 November 19 Stukas from III . / St.G 1 with escort drawn from JG 26 and JG 51 went out against another convoy ; as no targets were found over the estuary , the Stukas proceeded to attack Dover , their alternate target . 
 Bad weather resulted in a decline of anti @-@ shipping operations , and before long the Ju 87 groups began re @-@ deploying to Poland , as part of the concealed build @-@ up for Operation Barbarossa . By spring 1941 , only St.G 1 with 30 Ju 87s remained facing the United Kingdom . Operations on a small scale continued throughout the winter months into March . Targets included ships at sea , the Thames Estuary , the Chatham naval dockyard and Dover and night @-@ bomber sorties made over the Channel . These attacks were resumed the following winter .

 In response to the Italian defeats in Greece and North Africa , the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ordered the deployment of some German forces to these theatres . Amongst the Luftwaffe contingent deployed was the command unit StG 3 , which touched down in Sicily in December 1940 . In the next few days , two groups - some 80 Stukas - were deployed under X. Fliegerkorps . 
 The first task of the Korps was to attack British shipping passing between Sicily and Africa . The Ju 87s first made their presence felt by subjecting the British aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious to heavy attack . The crews were confident that they could sink it as the flight deck had an area of about 6 @,@ 500 square metres . On 10 January 1941 , the Stuka crews were told that four direct hits with 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) bombs would be enough to sink the carrier . The Ju 87s delivered six and three damaging near @-@ misses but the ship 's engines were untouched and she made for the besieged harbour of Malta . 
 The Italian Regia Aeronautica was equipped for a while with the Stukas . In 1939 , the Italian government asked the RLM to supply 100 Ju 87s . Italian pilots were sent to Graz in Austria to be trained for dive @-@ bombing aircraft . In the spring of 1940 , between 72 and 108 Ju 87 B @-@ 1s , some of them ex @-@ Luftwaffe aircraft , were delivered to 96 ° Gruppo <unk> a <unk> . The Italian Stuka , renamed Picchiatello , was in turn assigned to <unk> 97 ° , 101 ° and 102 ° . The <unk> were used against Malta , Allied convoys in Mediterranean and in North Africa ( where they took part in conquering Tobruk ) . They were used by the Regia Aeronautica up to 1942 . 
 Some of the <unk> saw action in the opening phase of the Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940 . Their numbers were low and ineffective in comparison to German operations . The Italian forces were quickly pushed back . By early 1941 , the Greeks had pushed into Italian occupied Albania . Once again , Hitler decided to send military aid to his ally . Before the Luftwaffe could intervene , the Italian Ju 87s achieved some successes . 97 Gruppo ( Group ) and its 239 Squadriglia ( Squadron ) sinking the Hellenic Navy freighter <unk> off Corfu on 4 April 1941 while the torpedo boat <unk> was sunk later in the day . On 21 April the Greek freighter <unk> was sunk and they accounted for the British tanker Hekla off Tobruk on 25 May and then the Royal Australian Navy destroyer Waterhen on 20 June . The British gunboat Cricket and supply submarine Cachalot became victims . The former was crippled and later sunk by Italian warships . 
 In March , the pro @-@ German Yugoslav government was toppled . A furious Hitler ordered the attack to be expanded to include Yugoslavia . Operation Marita commenced on 7 April . The Luftwaffe committed StG 1 , 2 and 77 to the campaign . The Stuka once again spearheaded the air assault , with a front line strength of 300 machines , against minimal Yugoslav resistance in the air , allowing the Stukas to develop a fearsome reputation in this region . Operating unmolested , they took a heavy toll of ground forces , suffering only light losses to ground fire . The effectiveness of the dive bombers helped bring about Yugoslav capitulation in just ten days . The Stukas also took a peripheral part in Operation Punishment , Hitler 's retribution bombing of Belgrade . The dive bombers were to attack airfields and anti @-@ aircraft gun positions whilst the level bombers struck civilian targets . Belgrade was badly damaged , with 2 @,@ 271 people reported killed and 12 @,@ 000 injured . 
 In Greece , despite British aid , little air opposition was encountered . As the Allies withdrew and resistance collapsed , the Allies began evacuating to Crete . The Stukas inflicted severe damage on Allied shipping . On 22 April , the 1 @,@ 389 ton destroyers Psara and <unk> were sunk . In the next two days , the Greek naval base at Piraeus lost 23 vessels to Stuka attack . 
 During the Battle of Crete , the Ju 87s also played a significant role . On 21 – 22 May 1941 , the Germans attempted to send in reinforcements to Crete by sea but lost 10 vessels to " Force D " under the command of Rear Admiral Irvine Glennie . The force , consisting of the cruisers HMS Dido , Orion and Ajax , forced the remaining German ships to retreat . The Stukas were called upon to deal with the British naval threat . On 21 May , the destroyer HMS Juno was sunk and the next day the battleship HMS Warspite was damaged and the cruiser HMS Gloucester was sunk , with the loss of 45 officers and 648 ratings . The Ju 87s also crippled the cruiser HMS Fiji that morning , ( she was later finished off by Bf 109 fighter bombers ) while sinking the destroyer HMS Greyhound with one hit . As the Battle of Crete drew to a close , the Allies began yet another withdrawal . On 23 May , the Royal Navy lost the destroyers HMS Kashmir and Kelly , followed by HMS Hereward on 26 May ; Orion and Dido were also severely damaged . Orion had been evacuating 1 @,@ 100 soldiers to North Africa ; 260 of them were killed and another 280 wounded . 
 The dive bomber wing supported Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel 's Afrika Korps in its two @-@ year campaign in North Africa ; its other main task was attacking Allied shipping . In 1941 , Ju 87 operations in North Africa were dominated by the Siege of Tobruk , which lasted for over seven months . It served during the Battle of Gazala and the First Battle of El Alamein , as well as the decisive Second Battle of El Alamein , which drove Rommel back to Tunisia . As the tide turned and Allied air power grew in the autumn of 1942 , the Ju 87 became very vulnerable and losses were heavy . The entry of the Americans into North Africa during Operation Torch made the situation far worse ; the Stuka was obsolete in what was now a fighter @-@ bomber 's war . The Bf 109 and Fw 190 could at least fight enemy fighters on equal terms after dropping their ordnance but the Stuka could not . The Ju 87 's vulnerability was demonstrated on 11 November 1942 , when 15 Ju 87 Ds were shot down by United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) Curtiss P @-@ <unk> in minutes . 
 By 1943 , the Allies enjoyed air supremacy in North Africa . The Ju 87s ventured out in Rotte strength only , often jettisoning their bombs at the first sight of enemy aircraft . Adding to this trouble , the German fighters had only enough fuel to cover the Ju 87s on take off , their most vulnerable point . After that , the Stukas were on their own . 
 The dive bombers continued operations in southern Europe ; after the Italian surrender in September 1943 , the Ju 87 participated in the last campaign @-@ sized victory over the Western Allies , the Dodecanese Campaign . The Dodecanese Islands had been occupied by the British ; the Luftwaffe committed 75 Stukas of StG 3 based in Megara ( I. / StG 3 ) and Argos ( <unk> 3 ; from 17 October on <unk> ) , to recover the islands . With the RAF bases some 500 kilometres ( 310 mi ) away , the Ju 87 helped the German landing forces rapidly conquer the islands . On 5 October the minelayer <unk> was sunk along with a patrol vessel , a steam ship and a light tank carrier Porto Di Roma . On 24 October Ju 87s sank the landing craft <unk> and cargo ship Taganrog at Samos . On 31 October the light cruiser Aurora was put out of action for a year . The light cruisers Penelope and Carlisle were badly damaged by StG 3 and the destroyer Panther was also sunk by Ju 87s before the capitulation of the Allied force . It proved to be the Stuka 's final victory against the British .

 On 22 June 1941 , the Wehrmacht commenced Operation Barbarossa , the invasion of the Soviet Union . The Luftwaffe order of battle of 22 June 1941 contained four dive bomber wings . VIII . Fliegerkorps under the command of General der Flieger Wolfram von Richthofen was equipped with units Stab , II. and III . / StG 1 . Also included were Stab , I. , II. and III. of Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 Immelmann . Attached to II . Fliegerkorps , under the command of General der Flieger Bruno Loerzer , were Stab , I. , II. and III. of StG 77 . Luftflotte 5 , under the command of Generaloberst Hans @-@ Jürgen <unk> , operating from Norway 's Arctic Circle , were allotted IV . Gruppe ( St ) / Lehrgeschwader 1 ( LG 1 ) . 
 The first Stuka loss on the Soviet @-@ German front occurred early at 03 : 40 – 03 : 47 in the morning of the 22 June . While being escorted by Bf 109s from JG 51 to attack Brest Fortress , Oberleutnant Karl <unk> of StG 77 was shot down by an I @-@ 153 . The dive bomber wing suffered only two losses on the opening day of Barbarossa . As a result of the Luftwaffe 's attention , the Soviet Air Force in the western Soviet Union was nearly destroyed . The official report claimed 1 @,@ 489 Soviet aircraft destroyed . Göring ordered this checked . After picking their way through the wreckage across the front , Luftwaffe officers found that the tally exceeded 2 @,@ 000 . In the next two days , the Soviets reported the loss of another 1 @,@ 922 aircraft . Soviet aerial resistance continued but ceased to be effective and the Luftwaffe maintained air superiority until the end of the year . 
 The Ju 87 took a huge toll on Soviet ground forces , helping to break up counterattacks of Soviet armour , eliminating strongpoints and disrupting the enemy supply lines . A demonstration of the Stuka 's effectiveness occurred on 5 July , when StG 77 knocked out 18 trains and 500 vehicles . As the 1st and 2nd Panzer Groups forced bridgeheads across the Dnieper river and closed in on Kiev , the Ju 87s again rendered invaluable support . On 13 September , Stukas from StG 1 destroyed the rail network in the vicinity as well as inflicting heavy casualties on escaping Red Army columns , for the loss of just one Ju 87 . On 23 September , Hans @-@ Ulrich Rudel ( who was to become the most decorated serviceman in the Wehrmacht ) of StG 2 , sank the Soviet battleship Marat , during an air attack on Kronstadt harbour near Leningrad , with a hit to the bow with a single 1 @,@ 000 kg ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) bomb . During this action , Leutnant Egbert <unk> sank the destroyer Minsk , while the destroyer Steregushchiy and submarine M @-@ 74 were also sunk . The Stukas also crippled the battleship Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya and the destroyers <unk> and <unk> in exchange for two Ju 87s shot down . 
 Elsewhere on the Eastern front , the Junkers assisted Army Group Centre in its drive toward Moscow . From 13 – 22 December , 420 vehicles and 23 tanks were destroyed by StG 77 , greatly improving the morale of the German infantry , who were by now on the defensive . StG 77 finished the campaign as the most effective dive bomber wing . It had destroyed 2 @,@ 401 vehicles , 234 tanks , 92 artillery batteries and 21 trains for the loss of 25 Ju 87s to hostile action . At the end of Barbarossa , StG 1 had lost 60 Stukas in aerial combat and one on the ground . StG 2 lost 39 Ju 87s in the air and two on the ground , StG 77 lost 29 of their dive @-@ bombers in the air and three on the ground ( 25 to enemy action ) . IV . ( St ) / <unk> , operating from Norway , lost 24 Ju 87s , all in aerial combat . 
 = = = = = Fall Blau to Stalingrad ; 1942 = = = = = 
 In early 1942 , the Ju 87s gave the German Army yet more valuable support . On 29 December 1941 , the Soviet 44th Army landed on the Kerch Peninsula . The Luftwaffe was only able to dispatch meager reinforcements of four bomber groups ( Kampfgruppen ) and two dive bomber groups belonging to StG 77 . With air superiority , the Ju 87s operated with impunity . In the first 10 days of the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula , half the landing force was destroyed , while sea lanes were blocked by the Stukas inflicting heavy losses on Soviet shipping . The Ju 87 's effectiveness against Soviet armour was not yet potent . Later versions of the T @-@ 34 tank could withstand Stuka attack in general , unless a direct hit was scored but the Soviet 44th Army had only obsolescent types with thin armour which were nearly all destroyed . 
 During the Battle of Sevastopol , the Stukas repeatedly bombed the trapped Soviet forces . Some Ju 87 pilots flew up to 300 sorties against the Soviet defenders . Luftflotte 4 's StG 77 flew 7 @,@ 708 combat sorties dropping 3 @,@ 537 tonnes of bombs on the city . Their efforts help secure the capitulation of Soviet forces on 4 July . 
 For the German summer offensive , Fall Blau , the Luftwaffe had concentrated 1 @,@ 800 aircraft into Luftflotte 4 making it the largest and most powerful air command in the world . The Stukawaffe strength stood at 151 . During the Battle of Stalingrad , Stukas flew thousands of sorties against Soviet positions in the city . StG 1 , 2 and 77 flew 320 sorties on 14 October 1942 . As the German Sixth Army pushed the Soviets into a 1 @,@ 000 metre enclave on the west bank of the Volga River , 1 @,@ 208 Stuka sorties were flown against this small strip of land . The intense air attack , though causing horrific losses on Soviet units , failed to destroy them . The Luftwaffe 's Stuka force made a maximum effort during this phase of the war . They flew an average of 500 sorties per day and caused heavy losses among Soviet forces , losing an average of only one Stuka per day . The Battle of Stalingrad marked the high point in the fortunes of the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka . As the strength of the Soviet Air Forces grew , they gradually wrested control of the skies from the Luftwaffe . From this point onward , Stuka losses increased . 
 = = = = = Kursk and decline ; 1943 = = = = = 
 The Stuka was also heavily involved in Operation Citadel , the Battle of Kursk . The Luftwaffe committed I , II , III . / St.G 1 and III . / StG 3 under the command of Luftflotte 6 . I. , II , III. of <unk> 2 and 3 were committed under the command of Hans Seidemann 's Fliegerkorps VIII . Hauptmann Rudel 's cannon @-@ equipped Ju 87 Gs had a devastating effect on Soviet armour at Orel and Belgorod . The Ju 87s participated in a huge aerial counter @-@ offensive lasting from 16 – 31 July against a Soviet offensive at <unk> and saved two German armies from encirclement , reducing the attacking Soviet 11th Guards Army to just 33 tanks by 20 July . The Soviet offensive had been completely halted from the air although losses were considerable . Fliegerkorps VIII lost eight Ju 87s on 8 July , six on 9 July , six on 10 July and another eight on 11 July . The Stuka arm also lost eight of their Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross holders . StG 77 lost 24 Ju 87s in the period 5 – 31 July ( StG had lost 23 in July – December 1942 ) , while StG 2 lost another 30 aircraft in the same period . In September 1943 , three of the Stuka units were re @-@ equipped with the Fw 190F and G ( ground attack versions ) and began to be renamed Schlachtgeschwader ( attack wings ) . In the face of overwhelming air opposition , the dive @-@ bomber required heavy protection from German fighters to counter Soviet fighters . Some units like SG 2 Immelmann continued to operate with great success throughout 1943 @-@ 45 , operating the Ju 87 G variants equipped with 37 mm cannons , which became tank killers , although in increasingly small numbers . 
 In the wake of the defeat at Kursk , Ju 87s played a vital defensive role on the southern wing of the Eastern Front . To combat the Luftwaffe , the Soviets could deploy some 3 @,@ 000 fighter aircraft . As a result , the Stukas suffered heavily . SG 77 lost 30 Ju 87s in August 1943 as did SG 2 Immelmann , which also reported the loss of 30 aircraft in combat operations . Despite these losses , Ju 87s helped the XXIX Army Corps break out of an encirclement near the Sea of Azov . The Battle of Kiev also included substantial use of the Ju 87 units , although again , unsuccessful in stemming the advances . Stuka units were with the loss of air superiority , becoming vulnerable on the ground as well . Some Stuka aces were lost this way . In the aftermath of Kursk , Stuka strength fell to 184 aircraft in total . This was well below 50 percent of the required strength . On 18 October 1943 , StG 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 77 were renamed Schlachtgeschwader ( SG ) wings , reflecting their ground @-@ attack role , as these combat wings were now also using ground @-@ attack aircraft , such as the Fw 190F @-@ series aircraft . The Luftwaffe 's dive @-@ bomber units had ceased to exist . 
 A small number of Ju 87s were also retained for anti @-@ shipping operations in the Black Sea , a role it had proved so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean . In October 1943 , this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several attacks against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet . On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the <unk> class destroyers Kharkov , <unk> and <unk> were caught and sunk by dive <unk> . After the disaster , Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission . 
 = = = = = Operation Bagration to Berlin 1944 – 45 = = = = = 
 Towards the end of the war , as the Allies gained air supremacy , the Stuka was being replaced by ground @-@ attack versions of the Fw 190 . By early 1944 , the number of Ju 87 units and operational aircraft terminally declined . For the Soviet summer offensive , Operation Bagration , 12 Ju 87 groups and five mixed groups ( including Fw 190s ) were on the Luftwaffe 's order of battle on 26 June 1944 . Gefechtsverband <unk> , a mixed aircraft unit , which included large numbers of Stuka dive bombers , was rushed to the Finnish front in the summer of 1944 and was instrumental in halting the Soviet fourth strategic offensive . The unit claimed 200 Soviet tanks and 150 Soviet aircraft destroyed for 41 losses . By 31 January 1945 , only 104 Ju 87s remained operational with their units . The other mixed Schlacht units contained a further 70 Ju 87s and Fw 190s between them . Chronic fuel shortages kept the Stukas grounded and sorties decreased until the end of the war in May 1945 . 
 In the final months of the war the ground attack groups were still able to impose operational constraints upon the enemy . Most notably the aircraft participated in the defence of Berlin . On 12 January 1945 the 1st Belorussian Front initiated the Vistula – Oder Offensive . The offensive made ground in its early phases . However , the Soviets soon outran their air support which was unable to use forward , quagmire @-@ filled , airfields . The Germans , who had fallen back on air bases resplendent with good facilities and concrete runways , were able to mount uninterrupted attacks against Soviet army columns . Reminiscent of the early years , the Luftwaffe was able to inflict high losses largely unopposed . Over 800 vehicles were destroyed within two weeks . In the first three days of February 1945 , 2 @,@ 000 vehicles and 51 tanks were lost to German air attacks . The Belorussian Front was forced to abandon its attempt to capture Berlin by mid @-@ February 1945 . The Ju 87 participated in these intense battles in small numbers . It was the largest concentration of German air power since 1940 and even late as February 1945 the Germans were able to achieve and challenge for air superiority on the Eastern Front . The air offensive was instrumental in saving Berlin , albeit only for three months . The effort exhausted German fuel reserves . The contribution of the Ju 87 was exemplified by Hans @-@ Ulrich Rudel , who claimed 13 enemy tanks on 8 February 1945 .

 Two intact Ju 87s survive : 
 Ju 87 R @-@ 2 / Trop . Werk Nr. <unk> 
 This aircraft is displayed in the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry . It was abandoned in North Africa and found by British forces in 1941 . The Ju 87 was donated by the British government and sent to the USA during the war . It was fully restored in 1974 by the EAA of Wisconsin . 
 Ju 87 G @-@ 2 , Werk Nr. <unk> . 
 A later , ground @-@ attack variant , this is displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum in London ; it was captured by British forces at Eggebek , Schleswig @-@ Holstein in May 1945 . It is thought to have been built in 1943 – 1944 as a D @-@ 5 before being rebuilt as a G @-@ 2 variant , possibly by fitting G @-@ 2 outer wings to a D @-@ 5 airframe . The wings have the hard @-@ points for Bordkanone BK 3 @,@ 7 gun @-@ pods , but these are not fitted . It was one of 12 captured German aircraft selected by the British for museum preservation and assigned to the Air Historical Branch . The aircraft was stored and displayed at various RAF sites until 1978 , when it was moved to the RAF Museum . In 1967 , permission was given to use the aircraft in the film Battle of Britain and it was repainted and modified to resemble a 1940 variant of the Ju 87 . The engine was found to be in excellent condition and there was little difficulty in starting it , but returning the aircraft to airworthiness was considered too costly for the filmmakers , and ultimately , models were used in the film to represent Stukas . In 1998 , the film modifications were removed , and the aircraft returned to the original G @-@ 2 configuration .

 = Low back pain = 
 Low back pain ( LBP ) is a common disorder involving the muscles , nerves , and bones of the back . Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling . Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute ( pain lasting less than 6 weeks ) , sub @-@ chronic ( 6 to 12 weeks ) , or chronic ( more than 12 weeks ) . The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical , non @-@ mechanical , or referred pain . The symptoms of low back pain usually improve within a few weeks from the time they start , with 40 @-@ 90 % of people completely better by six weeks . 
 In most episodes of low back pain , a specific underlying cause is not identified or even looked for , with the pain believed to be due to mechanical problems such as muscle or joint strain . If the pain does not go away with conservative treatment or if it is accompanied by " red flags " such as unexplained weight loss , fever , or significant problems with feeling or movement , further testing may be needed to look for a serious underlying problem . In most cases , imaging tools such as X @-@ ray computed tomography are not useful and carry their own risks . Despite this , the use of imaging in low back pain has increased . Some low back pain is caused by damaged intervertebral discs , and the straight leg raise test is useful to identify this cause . In those with chronic pain , the pain processing system may malfunction , causing large amounts of pain in response to non @-@ serious events . 
 The treatment of acute nonspecific low back pain of rapid onset is typically with simple pain medications and the continuation of as much normal activity as the pain allows . Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful , with paracetamol ( also known as acetaminophen ) as the preferred first medication . A number of other options are available for those who do not improve with usual treatment . <unk> may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough , but they are not generally recommended due to side effects . Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc @-@ related chronic pain and disability or spinal stenosis . No clear benefit has been found for other cases of non @-@ specific low back pain . Low back pain often affects mood , which may be improved by counseling or antidepressants . Additionally , there are many alternative medicine therapies , including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies , but there is not enough evidence to recommend them confidently . The evidence for chiropractic care and spinal manipulation is mixed . 
 Approximately 9 to 12 % of people ( 632 million ) have LBP at any given point in time , and nearly 25 % report having it at some point over any one @-@ month period . About 40 % of people have LBP at some point in their lives , with estimates as high as 80 % among people in the developed world . Difficulty most often begins between 20 and 40 years of age . Men and women are equally affected . Low back pain is more common among people aged 40 – 80 years , with the overall number of individuals affected expected to increase as the population ages . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 In the common presentation of acute low back pain , pain develops after movements that involve lifting , twisting , or forward @-@ bending . The symptoms may start soon after the movements or upon waking up the following morning . The description of the symptoms may range from tenderness at a particular point to diffuse pain . It may or may not worsen with certain movements , such as raising a leg , or positions , such as sitting or standing . Pain radiating down the legs ( known as sciatica ) may be present . The first experience of acute low back pain is typically between the ages of 20 and 40 . This is often a person 's first reason to see a medical professional as an adult . Recurrent episodes occur in more than half of people with the repeated episodes being generally more painful than the first . 
 Other problems may occur along with low back pain . Chronic low back pain is associated with sleep problems , including a greater amount of time needed to fall asleep , disturbances during sleep , a shorter duration of sleep , and less satisfaction with sleep . In addition , a majority of those with chronic low back pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Low back pain is not a specific disease but rather a complaint that may be caused by a large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness . The majority of LBP does not have a clear cause but is believed to be the result of non @-@ serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains . Obesity , smoking , weight gain during pregnancy , stress , poor physical condition , poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain . A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions . Physical causes may include osteoarthritis , degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation , broken vertebra ( e ) ( such as from osteoporosis ) or , rarely , an infection or tumor of the spine . 
 Women may have acute low back pain from medical conditions affecting the female reproductive system , including endometriosis , ovarian cysts , ovarian cancer , or uterine fibroids . Nearly half of all pregnant women report pain in the lower back or sacral area during pregnancy , due to changes in their posture and center of gravity causing muscle and ligament strain . 
 Low back pain can be broadly classified into four main categories : 
 Musculoskeletal - mechanical ( including muscle strain , muscle spasm , or osteoarthritis ) ; herniated nucleus <unk> , herniated disk ; spinal stenosis ; or compression fracture 
 Inflammatory - HLA @-@ <unk> associated arthritis including ankylosing spondylitis , reactive arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , and inflammatory bowel disease 
 <unk> - bone metastasis from lung , breast , prostate , thyroid , among others 
 Infectious - osteomyelitis ; abscess 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 = = = Back structures = = = 
 The lumbar ( or lower back ) region is made up of five vertebrae ( L1 @-@ L5 ) , sometimes including the sacrum . In between these vertebrae are <unk> discs , which act as cushions , preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together while at the same time protecting the spinal cord . Nerves come from and go to the spinal cord through specific openings between the vertebrae , providing the skin with sensations and messages to muscles . Stability of the spine is provided by the ligaments and muscles of the back and abdomen . Small joints called facet joints limit and direct the motion of the spine . 
 The <unk> muscles run up and down along the back of the spine , and are important for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting , walking and lifting . A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain , because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain . The problem with the <unk> muscles continues even after the pain goes away , and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back . Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program . 
 An intervertebral disc has a gelatinous core surrounded by a fibrous ring . When in its normal , uninjured state , most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run to the outside of the disc . Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc . Over time , the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces . This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine , causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae . As a result , there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass . When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease , the makeup of a disc changes : blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and / or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root . Any of these changes may result in back pain . 
 = = = Pain sensation = = = 
 Pain is generally an unpleasant feeling in response to an event that either damages or can potentially damage the body 's tissues . There are four main steps in the process of feeling pain : transduction , transmission , perception , and modulation . The nerve cells that detect pain have cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia and fibers that transmit these signals to the spinal cord . The process of pain sensation starts when the pain @-@ causing event triggers the endings of appropriate sensory nerve cells . This type of cell converts the event into an electrical signal by transduction . Several different types of nerve fibers carry out the transmission of the electrical signal from the <unk> cell to the posterior horn of spinal cord , from there to the brain stem , and then from the brain stem to the various parts of the brain such as the thalamus and the limbic system . In the brain , the pain signals are processed and given context in the process of pain perception . Through modulation , the brain can modify the sending of further nerve impulses by decreasing or increasing the release of neurotransmitters . 
 Parts of the pain sensation and processing system may not function properly ; creating the feeling of pain when no outside cause exists , signaling too much pain from a particular cause , or signaling pain from a normally non @-@ painful event . Additionally , the pain modulation mechanisms may not function properly . These phenomena are involved in chronic pain . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 As the structure of the back is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors , the diagnosis of low back pain is not straightforward . While most low back pain is caused by muscle and joint problems , this cause must be separated from neurological problems , spinal tumors , fracture of the spine , and infections , among others . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 There are a number of ways to classify low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best . There are three general types of low back pain by cause : mechanical back pain ( including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains , herniated discs , compressed nerve roots , degenerative discs or joint disease , and broken vertebra ) , non @-@ mechanical back pain ( tumors , inflammatory conditions such as <unk> , and infections ) , and referred pain from internal organs ( gallbladder disease , kidney stones , kidney infections , and aortic aneurysm , among others ) . Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases ( around 90 % or more ) , and of those , most ( around 75 % ) do not have a specific cause identified , but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments . Rarely , complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems , such as fibromyalgia and <unk> disorders . 
 Low back pain may be classified based on the signs and symptoms . Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements , and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond the buttocks , is classified as nonspecific , the most common classification . Pain that radiates down the leg below the knee , is located on one side ( in the case of disc herniation ) , or is on both sides ( in spinal stenosis ) , and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular , making up 7 % of cases . Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma , fever , a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention . 
 The symptoms can also be classified by duration as acute , sub @-@ chronic ( also known as sub @-@ acute ) , or chronic . The specific duration required to meet each of these is not universally agreed upon , but generally pain lasting less than six weeks is classified as acute , pain lasting six to twelve weeks is sub @-@ chronic , and more than twelve weeks is chronic . Management and prognosis may change based on the duration of symptoms . 
 = = = Red flags = = = 
 The presence of certain signs , termed red flags , indicate the need for further testing to look for more serious underlying problems , which may require immediate or specific treatment . The presence of a red flag does not mean that there is a significant problem . It is only suggestive , and most people with red flags have no serious underlying problem . If no red flags are present , performing diagnostic imaging or laboratory testing in the first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful . 
 The usefulness of many red flags are poorly supported by evidence . The most useful for detecting a fracture are : older age , corticosteroid use , and significant trauma especially if it results in skin markings . The best determinate for the presence of cancer is a history of the same . 
 With other causes ruled out , people with non @-@ specific low back pain are typically treated <unk> , without exact determination of the cause . Efforts to uncover factors that might complicate the diagnosis , such as depression , substance abuse , or an agenda concerning insurance payments may be helpful . 
 = = = Tests = = = 
 Imaging is indicated when there are red flags , ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve , or ongoing or worsening pain . In particular , early use of imaging ( either MRI or CT ) is recommended for suspected cancer , infection , or cauda equina syndrome . MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease ; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis . Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful . The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation . Lumbar provocative discography may be useful to identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain . Similarly , therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain . Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections , <unk> epidural injections and <unk> injections as diagnostic tests . Most other physical tests , such as evaluating for scoliosis , muscle weakness or wasting , and impaired reflexes , are of little use . 
 Complaints of low back pain are one of the most common reasons people visit doctors . For pain that has lasted only a few weeks , the pain is likely to subside on its own . Thus , if a person 's medical history and physical examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause , medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X @-@ rays , CT scans , and MRIs . Individuals may want such tests but , unless red flags are present , they are unnecessary health care . Routine imaging increases costs , is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit , and the radiation used may be harmful to one 's health . Fewer than 1 % of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem . Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities , encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry . Even so , MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300 % among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006 . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Exercise appears to be useful for preventing low back pain . Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks . Medium @-@ firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses . There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques . Shoe <unk> do not help prevent low back pain . 
 = = Management = = 
 Management of low back pain depends on which of the three general categories is the cause : mechanical problems , non @-@ mechanical problems , or referred pain . For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems , the goals are to restore normal function , return the individual to work , and minimize pain . The condition is normally not serious , resolves without much being done , and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities as soon as possible within the limits of pain . Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery . For those with sub @-@ chronic or chronic low back pain , multidisciplinary treatment programs may help . 
 = = = Physical management = = = 
 Increasing general physical activity has been recommended , but no clear relationship to pain or disability has been found when used for the treatment of an acute episode of pain . For acute pain , low- to moderate @-@ quality evidence supports walking . Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain , but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant . There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub @-@ chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain . Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays , but there is nothing to suggest that they will help with the pain . Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended . 
 Exercise therapy is effective in decreasing pain and improving function for those with chronic low back pain . It also appears to reduce recurrence rates for as long as six months after the completion of program and improves long @-@ term function . There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another . The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain , and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga . <unk> electrical nerve stimulation ( <unk> ) has not been found to be effective in chronic low back pain . Evidence for the use of shoe <unk> as a treatment is inconclusive . Peripheral nerve stimulation , a minimally @-@ invasive procedure , may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that do not respond to other measures , although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive , and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg . 
 = = = Medications = = = 
 The management of low back pain often includes medications for the duration that they are beneficial . With the first episode of low back pain the hope is a complete cure ; however , if the problem becomes chronic , the goals may change to pain management and the recovery of as much function as possible . As pain medications are only somewhat effective , expectations regarding their benefit may differ from reality , and this can lead to decreased satisfaction . 
 The medication typically recommended first is acetaminophen ( paracetamol ) or NSAIDs ( though not aspirin ) , and these are enough for most people . Standard doses of acetaminophen are very safe ; however , high doses may cause liver problems , and very high doses can be fatal . High @-@ quality reviews have found acetaminophen ( paracetamol ) to be no more effective than placebo at improving pain , quality of life , or function . NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen ; however , they carry a greater risk of side effects including : kidney failure , stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems . Thus , NSAIDs are a second choice to acetaminophen , recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter . NSAIDs are available in several different classes ; there is no evidence to support the use of COX @-@ 2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits . With respect to safety naproxen may be best . Muscle relaxants may be beneficial . 
 If the pain is still not managed adequately , short term use of opioids such as morphine may be useful . These medications carry a risk of addiction , may have negative interactions with other drugs , and have a greater risk of side effects , including dizziness , nausea , and constipation . <unk> may be suitable for short @-@ term management of severe , acute pain that is causing significant problems . Specialist groups advise against general long @-@ term use of opioids for chronic low back pain . 
 For older people with chronic pain , opioids may be used in those for whom NSAIDs present too great a risk , including those with diabetes , stomach or heart problems . They may also be useful for a select group of people with neuropathic pain . 
 Antidepressants may be effective for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression , but they have a risk of side effects . Although the <unk> drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain , there is insufficient evidence to support their use . Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain . <unk> joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to be effective in those with persistent , non @-@ radiating pain ; however , they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain . Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short @-@ term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit . There are also concerns of potential side effects . 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 Surgery may be useful in those with a herniated disc that is causing significant pain radiating into the leg , significant leg weakness , bladder problems , or loss of bowel control . It may also be useful in those with spinal stenosis . In the absence of these issues , there is no clear evidence of a benefit from surgery . 
 <unk> ( the partial removal of a disc that is causing leg pain ) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments . <unk> has better outcomes at one year but not at four to ten years . The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown to result in a different outcome than regular <unk> . For most other conditions , there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options . The long @-@ term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear . Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times , but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient . 
 For those with pain localized to the lower back due to disc degeneration , fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low @-@ intensity nonsurgical measures . Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment , although only a few of those who have spinal fusion experience good results . There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion , with no clear evidence of one being better than the others . Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function . 
 = = = Alternative medicine = = = 
 It is unclear if chiropractic care or spinal manipulation therapy ( SMT ) improves outcomes in those with low back pain more or less than other treatments . Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short , intermediate , and long @-@ term follow @-@ up ; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions , sham manipulation , or other treatments , and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes . National guidelines reach different conclusions , with some not recommending spinal manipulation , some describing manipulation as optional , and others recommending a short course for those who do not improve with other treatments . Manipulation under anaesthesia , or medically assisted manipulation , has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation . 
 Acupuncture is no better than placebo , usual care , or sham acupuncture for nonspecific acute pain or sub @-@ chronic pain . For those with chronic pain , it improves pain a little more than no treatment and about the same as medications , but it does not help with disability . This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow @-@ up . Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications . 
 While massage therapy does not appear to provide much benefit for acute low back pain , it may help those with sub @-@ chronic and chronic pain , particularly when combined with physical exercises and education . Tentative evidence suggests that acupuncture and massage together may be better than massage alone . 
 <unk> – the practice of injecting solutions into joints ( or other areas ) to cause inflammation and thereby stimulate the body 's healing response – has not been found to be effective by itself , although it may be helpful when added to another therapy . 
 Herbal medicines , as a whole , are poorly supported by evidence . The herbal treatments Devil 's claw and white willow may reduce the number of individuals reporting high levels of pain ; however , for those taking pain relievers , this difference is not significant . <unk> , in the form of either a gel or a plaster cast , has been found to reduce pain and increase function . 
 Behavioral therapy may be useful for chronic pain . There are several types available , including operant conditioning , which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors ; cognitive behavioral therapy , which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior ; and respondent conditioning , which can modify an individual 's physiological response to pain . Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies . The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness @-@ based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability , although it suggests that it may be useful in improving the acceptance of existing pain . 
 Tentative evidence supports <unk> ( NRT ) , in which small pieces of metal are placed just under the skin of the ear and back , for non @-@ specific low back pain . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Overall , the outcome for acute low back pain is positive . Pain and disability usually improve a great deal in the first six weeks , with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90 % . In those who still have symptoms after six weeks , improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year . At one year , pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people . Distress , previous low back pain , and job satisfaction are predictors of long @-@ term outcome after an episode of acute pain . Certain psychological problems such as depression , or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain . Following a first episode of back pain , recurrences occur in more than half of people . 
 For persistent low back pain , the short @-@ term outcome is also positive , with improvement in the first six weeks but very little improvement after that . At one year , those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability . People at higher risk of long @-@ term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity ( 2 @.@ 5 times more likely to have poor outcomes at one year ) , those with a poor ability to cope with pain , functional impairments , poor general health , or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain ( Waddell 's signs ) . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Low back pain that lasts at least one day and limits activity is a common complaint . Globally , about 40 % of people have LBP at some point in their lives , with estimates as high as 80 % of people in the developed world . Approximately 9 to 12 % of people ( 632 million ) have LBP at any given point in time , and nearly one quarter ( 23 @.@ 2 % ) report having it at some point over any one @-@ month period . Difficulty most often begins between 20 and 40 years of age . Low back pain is more common among people aged 40 – 80 years , with the overall number of individuals affected expected to increase as the population ages . 
 It is not clear whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain . A 2012 review reported a rate of 9 @.@ 6 % among males and 8 @.@ 7 % among females . Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males , which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis , menstruation , and pregnancy among women , or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men . An estimated 70 % of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy . Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – are more likely to have low back pain than former smokers , and former smokers are more likely to have low back pain than those who have never smoked . 
 = = History = = 
 Low back pain has been with humans since at least the Bronze Age . The oldest known surgical treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus , dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a vertebral sprain . Hippocrates ( c . 460 BCE – c . 370 BCE ) was the first to use a term for sciatic pain and low back pain ; Galen ( active mid to late second century CE ) described the concept in some detail . Physicians through the end of the first millennium did not attempt back surgery and recommended watchful waiting . Through the Medieval period , folk medicine practitioners provided treatments for back pain based on the belief that it was caused by spirits . 
 At the start of the 20th century , physicians thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves , with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time . The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century . In the early 20th century , American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain . In the 1920s and 1930s , new theories of the cause arose , with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness ( neurasthenia ) and female hysteria . Muscular rheumatism ( now called fibromyalgia ) was also cited with increasing frequency . 
 Emerging technologies such as X @-@ rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools , revealing the intervertebral disc as a source for back pain in some cases . In 1938 , orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc @-@ related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery . As a result of this work , in the 1940s , the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over , dominating the literature through the 1980s , aiding further by the rise of new imaging technologies such as CT and MRI . The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain . Since then , physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 Low back pain results in large economic costs . In the United States , it is the most common type of pain in adults , responsible for a large number of missed work days , and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department . In 1998 , it was estimated to be responsible for $ 90 billion in annual health care costs , with 5 % of individuals incurring most ( 75 % ) of the costs . Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US , despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness . Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity , with low back pain responsible for 40 % of all missed work days in the United States . Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada , Great Britain , the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany . 
 Workers who experience acute low back pain as a result of a work injury may be asked by their employers to have x @-@ rays . As in other cases , testing is not indicated unless red flags are present . An employer 's concern about legal liability is not a medical indication and should not be used to justify medical testing when it is not indicated . There should be no legal reason for encouraging people to have tests which a health care provider determines are not indicated .

 Total disc replacement is an experimental option , but no significant evidence supports its use over lumbar fusion .

 " Tunnel Vision " is a mid @-@ tempo R & B song with an EDM influence . Billboard 's Jason Lipshutz noted that it has an instrumentation that features " fizzing beats abetted by the producer 's [ Timbaland ] signature ad @-@ libs and vocal record @-@ scratches " , while according to Sobhi Youssef of Sputnikmusic the song is build on " still @-@ existing chops with a drum heavy , syncopated backbone amidst frenetically shifting bass melodies , sweeping orchestrations , and vacuous synths that all coalesce into a fuzzed out boom @-@ bap . " Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media called the synthesizer " sinister " and , according to Slant Magazine 's Eric Henderson , it has Middle Eastern tones . Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle called the beats and vocal loops on " Tunnel Vision " reminiscent of Timbaland 's past work with the late American singer Aaliyah . According to Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post , its beat resembles that on 50 Cent 's 2007 single " Ayo Technology " ( also featuring Timberlake ) . 
 " Tunnel Vision " features " thrilling " evolutions in production and arrangement complementing Timberlake 's vocals , and the song 's unusual , abrupt changes unite it throughout . It borrows the " dark alley " rhythm of The 20 / 20 Experience 's third track , " Don 't Hold the Wall " ; Timberlake sings in his lower register , with an " exciting " upward arpeggio . Timbaland uses the singer 's voice as a " flexible instrument to enhance his tech savvy soundscape " , constructing " layers of production elements into towers of sonic force " . Lauren Martin of Fact called the song the start of Timbaland 's " Bollywood influenced ' Indian Flute ' era " and a tease ; Timberlake 's voice is redistributed , with wider range and suspense . 
 The song 's lyrics describe Timberlake 's tunnel vision of his love interest , with several voyeuristic references . The singer professes his love : " I look around and everything I see is beautiful , because all I see is you . " According to The Huffington Post 's Dean , Timberlake is in happier state of mind than on his 2002 song " Cry Me a River " or his 2007 single " What Goes Around ... Comes Around " . However , his lyrics have an obsessive quality : " A million people in a crowded room , but my camera lens is only set to zoom and it all becomes so clear . " Mellisa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that on " Tunnel Vision " , Timberlake is lyrically " playing the rom @-@ com director " : " Just like a movie shoot , I ’ m <unk> ’ in on you as we ride off into the sun . " According to Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times , Timberlake uses references to " cameras and reflective surfaces " to reflect on the " changing nature of celebrity " .

 " Tunnel Vision " ' s music video premiered on July 3 , 2013 on Timberlake 's Vevo YouTube channel . The singer tweeted , " Check out the new video for Tunnel Vision and be ready ... it 's explicit . <unk> " . The video was directed by Jonathan Craven , Simon McLoughlin and Jeff Nicholas , with a cameo appearance by Timbaland . Craven and Nathan Scherrer produced the video for the Uprising Creative . Its director of photography was Sing Howe Yam , and Jacquelyn London edited the video for Sunset Edit . 
 The seven @-@ minute video features Timberlake and Timbaland gazing at three nude women ; according to Jason Lipshutz of Billboard , the women are wearing flesh @-@ colored G @-@ strings . In some shots , Timberlake 's face is projected onto the women 's bodies . Jordan Sargent of Spin called the set pieces where projections of Timberlake interact with the nude dancers " a fractured dynamic that mirrors ' Tunnel Vision ' itself " . 
 Cinya Burton of E ! wrote about Timberlake 's video wardrobe , " Apparently when Justin Timberlake isn 't in his now @-@ signature suit and tie getup , he 's donning <unk> . " The singer wore two head @-@ to @-@ toe ensembles by the brand . The first was a gray Baxley V @-@ neck T @-@ shirt layered under a white <unk> half @-@ sleeved shirt , with casual Charge Chino pants . The second , a darker combination worn while he dances against a lighter background , was a black Resident Crew T @-@ shirt , dark gray Pipe Chino pants , a Duncan denim shirt and black Trap boots . According to Burton , " While his ensembles are both dapper " , the nude models in the video attracted more attention .

 Critics have called the video NSFW , comparing it to the 2013 video for " Blurred Lines " by Robin Thicke with Pharrell Williams and T.I .. In an interview with Capital FM , Thicke responded to a question about the videos ' similarity : " No comment . I 'll let you do all the talking . It 's a subject that has no good ending . " Fact magazine called the video 's concept simple , and said its production team was unconcerned . According to Spin 's Jordan Sargent , " Like his new album The 20 / 20 Experience , in which half the songs run longer than seven minutes , the ' Tunnel Vision ' video is self @-@ consciously artistic and mature . But the video is also at times effective , particularly when the editing gets choppier during the bridge . " 
 About the nude women in the video , an MTV UK reviewer said that Timberlake drew on Thicke 's video . The Huffington Post 's Sarah Dean wrote that Timberlake used a tip from Thicke to accompany a " great " song with a video objectifying women who enjoy dancing nude , criticizing the use of three women for a song with lyrics about a single love interest . According to Tamar Anitai of MTV Buzzworthy , Timberlake wanted to live his life and celebrate his album 's success : " Oh , come on ! Don 't complain . You bitched and moaned endlessly when Justin Timberlake stopped making music for six years , so don 't get all Veruca Salty when he comes back with boobs to spare and boobs to share . " 
 In her review , Rachel Maresca of the New York Daily News wrote that Timberlake slurred some of the song 's explicit lyrics in the video . According to Kathy McCabe of News Corp Australia , Timberlake escalated the pop @-@ porn movement with the video : " With mummy blogger outrage over Robin Thicke 's exploitation of topless women for his Blurred Lines video – and its questionable lyrics – still raging , Timberlake has gone even further in his clip " . McCabe wrote that male pop singers have been influenced by Rihanna and Katy Perry , who have " stripped down in the name of a hit . Or art . Or freedom of expression , depending on the press release spin " . Clash 's Robin Murray wrote that pop music has lacked raunchiness and sex appeal for some time , and Timberlake 's return was needed : " Lavish , lush and 21st century in a direct , shocking fashion , the video finds Justin Timberlake on perfect preening form . " 
 After the video 's release it was banned from YouTube with a message saying , " This video has been removed as a violation of YouTube 's policy on nudity or sexual content " . The website quickly restored the video with a content warning and the requirement that viewers sign in ( to verify their age ) . Although a YouTube representative declined to comment on individual videos , he issued a statement : " While our guidelines generally prohibit nudity , we make exceptions when it is presented in an educational , documentary or artistic context , and take care to add appropriate warnings and age restrictions " .

 Timberlake first performed " Tunnel Vision " at the Phoenix Park concert in Dublin , Ireland , as part of a set list which included " Cry Me a River " , " SexyBack " and " My Love " . In a review of the concert , John Balfe of entertainment.ie wrote : " Even the album 's more well @-@ known songs like ' Tunnel Vision ' , ' Mirrors ' and ' Suit & Tie ' don 't yet have the same weight in the setlist as some of JT 's more established hits and it was songs like ' SexyBack ' that really got the 40 @,@ 000 strong crowd to move " . On July 12 Timberlake appeared on the main stage at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford , London as part of the Wireless Festival , performing " Tunnel Vision " and other songs dressed in black and wearing a black fedora .

 " Katie and Emily " is the ninth and penultimate episode of the third series of the British teen drama Skins , which first aired on 19 March 2009 on E4 in both Ireland and the United Kingdom . The episode was written by Malcolm Campbell and Bryan Elsley , and was directed by Charles Martin . The episode focuses on the characters of twins Katie and Emily Fitch ( Megan and Kathryn Prescott , respectively ) as they prepare for their college 's annual ball . Katie refuses to leave home , recovering from being hit in the head with a rock , and faces her weakening control over her sister . Emily , meanwhile , is heartbroken when her girlfriend , Naomi Campbell ( Lily Loveless ) , turns down Emily 's invitation to the ball , and comes out to her family about her sexuality . 
 " Katie and Emily " featured numerous cameo appearances by the series ' crew members and the winners of various Skins @-@ related competitions . While filming one of the episode 's fight scenes , according to Kathryn Prescott , the actors " did it a bit too properly " , with injuries sustained to both Megan Prescott and Giles Thomas . The episode drew just under one million viewers on its first broadcast and was E4 's highest @-@ rated programme of the week . It was received generally well by critics . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Emily , disguised as her twin sister Katie , arrives at college to take Katie 's history exam . In reality , Katie is at home , with nine stitches to the head after being hit with a rock by their friend Effy Stonem , who has disappeared . Katie is embarrassed about how her injuries look , and miserable over the loss of her boyfriend Freddie Mclair ( Luke Pasqualino ) , who only dated her to spite Effy , his real love interest . She begins to take notice of all the hints in front of her , and realises that she can no longer hide from herself the fact that Emily is homosexual . At college , Naomi uncovers Emily 's disguise ( which had not fooled JJ or Freddie either ) and tells her that she plans to spend the summer alone in Cyprus . When Emily tells Naomi that she will miss her , they kiss in an empty corridor and later find themselves at Naomi 's house where they have sex . Afterward , Emily asks Naomi to the college ball , but Naomi , still crippled by insecurity over her sexuality , refuses , leaving Emily heartbroken . Emily leaves and at the bus stop meets Thomas Tomone ( Merveille Lukeba ) , who offers her his shoes and jacket and is unconcerned when she tells him that she is gay . He tries to comfort her but admits that he believes it impossible to stop loving somebody , referring to his ex @-@ girlfriend Pandora Moon ( Lisa Backwell ) . Emily returns home and comes out to her family , telling them that she has been having sex with a girl named Naomi . Her father , Rob ( John Bishop ) , dismisses it as a joke and her mother , Jenna ( Ronni Ancona ) , is speechless , while Katie tries to deny it . She and Emily have a heated argument , leaving Katie crying . 
 The following morning , Naomi visits the <unk> ' house , but Jenna answers the door . She confronts Naomi , convincing her that Emily is not gay and warning Naomi to stay away from her . Naomi too denies her own sexual orientation and leaves hastily . After waking up , Katie and Emily reconcile in their own secret language , and Emily reluctantly agrees to go to the ball with Katie . While shopping for ball gowns , they meet Pandora , who is returning a dress since Thomas has not forgiven her for her infidelity with their friend James Cook . The twins run into Freddie and JJ Jones ( Ollie Barbieri ) while trying on dresses . JJ reveals to Emily that he told Freddie that he had sex with her , and Freddie inadvertently tells Katie , who was unaware of this . She guilts Freddie into accompanying her to the ball and volunteers Emily to go with JJ . Later , she is furious with Emily for having sex with JJ without her permission , still insisting that Emily is " not gay , [ just ] stupid " . Katie intercepts one of Naomi 's phone calls to Emily and tricks Naomi into meeting with her , where she reveals Emily 's affair with JJ and warns Naomi not to come to the ball . 
 As Katie , Emily , Freddie and JJ prepare to enter the ball , Naomi arrives , announcing that she knows about Emily and JJ 's fling before she walks in . An upset Emily leaves . Katie starts a fight with Naomi . Unaware of Emily 's presence , she admits her deceit and claims that Emily " deserved it . " Infuriated , Emily attacks Katie , wreaking havoc through the entire ball . Emily finally overpowers her sister and raises a fist to punch her , but , after a moment 's hesitation , reconsiders and instead helps Katie to stand up , declaring that she is " not her . " In front of everybody , Emily tells Katie that she is her own person and that she is in love with Naomi . Katie accepts Emily 's individuality and sexuality , and Naomi , no longer ashamed of their relationship , extends her hand to Emily . The couple leaves the ball hand @-@ in @-@ hand and Naomi tells Emily that she loves her too . Meanwhile , Pandora apologises again to Thomas and he forgives her , re @-@ introducing himself .

 " Katie and Emily " featured a number of cameo appearances . Phil Goldie , who won the " Skins Needs You " competition for young directors , appears as a man in the café where Naomi meets Katie . Clara Nicholls and Antonio <unk> , the winners of a competition to win a speaking role in Skins , played the shop assistant and security guard respectively at the boutique where Katie and Emily shop for ball gowns , while another finalist from the competition , <unk> Taylor , starred as a girl dancing with the students ' Head of Form , Doug ( Giles Thomas ) , at the ball . One of the series ' runners , Laurence Wigfield , played a bystander at the ball and the crew 's " jack of all trades " , Tyrone Hyman , appeared on a poster in Katie and Emily 's bedroom . 
 Lisa Backwell described the filming of the ball as her " most favourite , most mental day of filming " . At the end of the final take of Pandora 's dancing with Doug , the students ' head of year , the entire crew danced into shot . Director Charles Martin was initially dubious of whether Megan and Kathryn Prescott would be able to film Katie and Emily 's fight well enough , but Kathryn said that on their first rehearsal they " did it a bit too properly " , ripping out parts of Megan 's hair extensions . Emily 's accidental punching of Doug during the fight was choreographed so that when Kathryn Prescott punched the air in front of Giles Thomas 's face , the camera angle would make it appear that she was actually hitting him . While they were filming , however , Prescott genuinely punched Thomas by accident , causing him to stumble back and step on Megan Prescott 's bare foot , which she injured .

 = Lactifluus deceptivus = 
 Lactifluus deceptivus ( synonym Lactarius deceptivus ) , commonly known as the deceiving milkcap , is a common species of fungus in the Russulaceae family . It is found throughout eastern North America on the ground in coniferous forests near hemlock or deciduous forests near oak , and in oak @-@ dominated forests of Costa Rica . It produces large mushrooms with funnel @-@ shaped caps reaching up to 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter , on top of hard white stems that may reach 4 – 10 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) long and up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The gills are closely spaced together and yellowish @-@ cream in color . When young , the cap is white in all parts , but the depressed center becomes dull brownish in age and breaks up into scales . The edge of the cap has a roll of cottony tissue that collapses as the cap expands . The surface of the stem — especially near the base — has a velvety texture . The mushroom " bleeds " a milky white acrid latex when it is cut or injured . The fruit bodies are edible , but have a bitter taste that can be removed with cooking . Similar milk @-@ cap species with which L. deceptivus might be confused include Lactifluus piperatus , L. <unk> , L. caeruleitinctus , L. subvellereus , Lactarius <unk> and Lactarius <unk> . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described in the scientific literature by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1885 . The specific epithet deceptivus is derived from the Latin word for " deceptive " . The name may allude to the contrasting appearance of young and old fruit bodies . It is commonly known as the " deceptive lactarius " , the " deceiving lactarius " , or the " deceptive milkcap " . In the state of Puebla , Mexico , it is known as <unk> de chivo , or " kid ear " . 
 Following the split @-@ off of the phylogenetically distinct genus Lactifluus from the other milk @-@ caps in the genus Lactarius , the correct combination for the species is the one made by Otto Kuntze in 1891 , Lactifluus deceptivus . Within the genus Lactifluus , L. deceptivus is classified in the subgenus Lactifluus , section <unk> . Characteristics of species in this section include a white or whitish immature cap that may later turn yellow @-@ brown to cinnamon @-@ color ; white to cream @-@ colored latex that typically has an acrid taste ; a velvet @-@ textured stem due to a cuticle made of long narrow , thick @-@ walled hairs . Other species in this section include L. vellereus ( the type species ) , L. subvellereus , and L. caeruleitinctus . 
 Based on a morphological study published in 2005 , Lactarius <unk> is considered synonymous with Lactifluus deceptivus . L. <unk> , described by Hesler and Smith in their 1979 monograph of North American milk @-@ caps , was considered by them to be a " satellite species " , differing from L. deceptivus on the basis of smaller spores , smaller ornamentations on the surface of the spores , crowded and forked narrow gills , and differences in the micro @-@ structure of the cap cuticle . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is 7 @.@ 5 – 25 @.@ 5 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 – 10 @.@ 0 in ) in diameter , initially convex , but becomes funnel @-@ shaped in age . The margin ( cap edge ) is rolled inwards and cottony when young , concealing the immature gills . The cap surface is dry , smooth and whitish when young , often with yellowish or brownish stains , but becomes coarsely scaly and darkens to dull brownish @-@ ochre with age . The gills have an adnate to decurrent attachment to the stem , close to subdistant , white at first then cream to pale ochre . They are 5 – 65 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 6 in ) long and 1 – 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 04 – 0 @.@ 3 in ) deep . The stem is 4 – 10 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) long , up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick , nearly equal in width throughout or tapered downward . It is dry , scurfy to nearly smooth and white , staining brown with age . It is initially stuffed ( as if filled with cotton ) , but later becomes hollow . The flesh is thick and white , and between 3 and 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 and 0 @.@ 6 in ) thick . The latex produced by the mushroom is white , and does not change color upon exposure to air , although it stains the mushroom flesh a yellowish @-@ brown color . 
 The odor of the flesh and latex may range from indistinct to pungent or turnip @-@ like in age ; the taste is strongly acrid — so much that it may have an <unk> effect in the throat . In his original description of the species , Peck reported " An experiment of its edible qualities was made without any evil consequences . " Thorough cooking removes the bitter taste , but the mushroom is not highly regarded as an edible , and as Hesler and Smith have noted " ... but even with this compensating feature some of our acquaintances have found it rather undesirable ( and indigestible ) . " The mushroom is sold at traditional markets in Puebla , Mexico . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 The spore print , freshly made , is white to whitish ; after drying out the spores in mass are pale yellowish . The spores are broadly ellipsoid , hyaline ( translucent ) and measure 9 – 13 by 7 – 9 µm . An apiculus is prominent . The spores are ornamented with warts and spines that do not form a reticulum ( a system of raised , net @-@ like ridges ) on the surface . The prominences are up to 1 @.@ 5 µm high , and amyloid , meaning they absorb iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored , and measure 46 – 58 by 7 – 9 µm . The pleurocystidia ( cystidia found on the face of a gill ) are very abundant , roughly club @-@ shaped to ventricose ( swollen in the middle ) , with apices often tapering ; their dimensions are 48 – 96 x 6 – 10 µm . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the edge of the gills ) are 40 – 58 x 5 – 7 µm , and more or less similar in appearance to the pleurocystidia . The cap cuticle is made of a layer of somewhat uplifted hyphae . The stem cuticle is a layer of bent @-@ over hyphae bearing thick @-@ walled , filamentous caulocystidia ( cystidia on the stem ) , and it lacks a gelatinous layer . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The fungus Lactifluus <unk> is very similar to L. deceptivus in its external appearance , but it has spore ornamentation that forms a reticulum , and its stem is an ixocutis ( a gelatinous layer of hyphae lying parallel to the surface ) . L. caeruleitinctus is also similar in appearance , but it has a milky @-@ white stem with blue tints that develops more intense blue coloration after handling , and it lacks a cottony , inrolled margin . Other lookalike species include Lactarius <unk> , which has a much smaller cap and smaller spores , and Lactarius <unk> , which has a small , zonate cap . Russula brevipes and R. <unk> are also somewhat similar in appearance , but they do not produce latex when cut or injured . Lactifluus subvellereus var. <unk> has more widely spaced gills , and an even cap margin . Lactifluus piperatus has densely crowded gills , a firm rather than soft and cottony cap margin , and exceedingly acrid latex . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Like all milk @-@ caps ( Lactarius and Lactifluus ) , L. deceptivus is mycorrhizal , meaning the fungus forms a mutualistic association with certain trees and shrubs . The subterranean mycelium of the fungus forms an intimate association with tree roots , enveloping them in a sheath of tissue that allows both organisms to exchange nutrients they would otherwise be unable to obtain . The fruit bodies of the fungus grow solitarily , scattered , or in groups on the ground in conifer or hardwood forests , often under oak ( Quercus ) or hemlock ( Tsuga ) . Smith has noted a preference for bogs and the edges of woodland pools in hardwood forests , and in oak stands that have an understory of blueberry bushes ( Vaccinium species ) . It is widely distributed in eastern North America , and has also been reported from southern and western Canada . It is a fairly common species , and fruits from June to October . The mushroom has also been reported from Mexico ( in Puebla and in Veracruz ) from oak and pine forests , at altitudes slightly over 2 @,@ 000 meters ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , and from Costa Rica , where it is abundant in oak forests .

The temple is formed by a circular wall with 64 chambers and an open mandapa in the centre , separated by a courtyard , which is circular in shape , where Lord Shiva is deified It is believed that the Parliament House , known as <unk> Bhavan , built in Delhi in the 1920s , has been patterned on the lines of this circular @-@ shaped Chausath Yogini Temple , dated to 1323 AD .

 According to an inscription dated to 1323 AD ( Vikram Samvat 1383 ) , the temple was built by Maharaja <unk> in 8th century . It is said that the temple was the venue of providing education in astrology and mathematics based on the transit of the Sun . 
 The Archaeological Survey of India has declared the temple as an ancient and historical monument under Act No . LXXI of 1951 , <unk> / 11 / 1951 . 
 = = Features = = 
 The temple is externally circular in shape with a radius of 170 feet ( 52 m ) and within its interior part it has 64 small chambers , each with a mandapa which is open and a facia of pilasters and pillars . The roof of the entire structure is flat including that of another east facing circular temple within the outer circular wall . A large passage or courtyard lies between the outer enclosure and the central temple which is dedicated to Lord Shiva . There is an open porch entrance to this temple . The exterior surface of the outer wall has carvings of Hindu deities . Each of the 64 chambers in the outer circle has an image of Shiva deified in it . However , recent investigations have confirmed that originally these had a Yogini image deified in them and hence the temple is known as Chausath Yogini Temple ( ' Chausath ' here means " Sixty four " ) . It is said that the roof over the 64 chambers and the central shrine had towers or shikharas which were probably removed during later modifications . 
 Within the main central shrine there are slab coverings which have perforations in them to drain rainwater to a large underground storage . The pipe lines from the roof lead the rain water to the storage are also visible . The temple needs conservation measures to preserve the ancient monument in good shape . 
 The design of the temple has withstood earthquake shocks , without any damage to its circular structural features , in the past several centuries . The temple is in the Seismic Zone III . This fact was cited when the issue of safety from earthquake effect of the Parliament House which is also a circular structure , similar to the Chausath Yogini Temple , was debated in the Indian Parliament .

 The music video was shot by Kazuaki Seki , in Yokohama on 11 March 2011 . A power blackout caused from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake prevented them from continuing filming , and the music video wasn 't completed . Filming was then slightly reduced two weeks before the release . The concept of the video was " female spies " , which is reflected in the makeup and clothing . The music video appeared on the DVD single . The music video also appeared on Perfume 's DVD compilation sets for JPN , and Perfume Clips ( 2014 ) . The music video appeared on a YouTube reaction video , hosted by The Fine Brothers ; the video was part of the " Teens <unk> to J @-@ Pop " compilation . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The music video opens with a mysterious man holding a briefcase , walking down a futuristic hallway . As the music starts , the girls start dancing in a dark office with lights flashing in the background . As the chorus starts , the girls start shooting laser beams from their fingers , and dance to the song . The girls teleport into the futuristic labyrinth , looking for the man with the briefcase . Inter cut scenes features the group dancing and singing to the song , whilst in several different hallways . During the second chorus , the girls continue to search for him without any luck . The man enters the office , sits down on a sofa , with a helmet piece of shiny – coloured plastic on his head . The girls find the office entrance , with CCTV footage catching them enter the room . 
 As they enter the room , the man stands up and holds the briefcase . During the third chorus , they engage in battle and circulate the room for defence . Inter cut scenes have the group dancing to the song in the room . Perfume member Kashiyuka summons a mini version of herself , holding onto it , and casting a spell against the man , making him fall to the ground . As they celebrate , Perfume member Nocchi goes towards him and retrieves the briefcase . However , the man stands up and transforms into a polar bear ; he then pushes Nocchi to the ground . Perfume member A @-@ Chan throws an apple as a detraction , and the group attacks the bear by using laser beams . Defeated , the polar bear shrinks and transforms into a plush toy . A @-@ Chan picks up the plush toy , and Kashiyuka opens the briefcase to witness a small gold ornament . The video ends with the group exiting the office .

 = Battarrea phalloides = 
 Battarrea phalloides is an inedible species of mushroom in the family Agaricaceae , and the type species of the genus Battarrea . Known in the vernacular as the <unk> @-@ stalked puffball , sandy <unk> , or desert stalked puffball , it has a woody , slender , and shaggy or scaly stem that is typically up to 40 centimeters ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) in length . Although its general appearance resembles an agaric with stem and gills , atop the stem is a spore sac , consisting of an peridium and a powdery internal gleba . In maturity , the spore sac ruptures to release the spores . Battarrea phalloides is found in dry , sandy locations throughout the world , and has been collected from Africa , Asia , Australia , Europe , North America ( primarily in western regions ) , and South America . There is currently some disagreement in the literature as to whether the European B. <unk> is the same species as B. phalloides . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first mentioned in the scientific literature in 1784 , when Thomas Jenkinson Woodward described a new species found by Mr. Humphreys of Norwich . It was named by James Dickson in 1785 as Lycoperdon phalloides , and the type locality was Suffolk , England . Christian Hendrik Persoon sanctioned the name when he transferred to Battarrea in his 1801 Synopsis Methodica Fungorum , a newly circumscribed genus named after the Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio <unk> . Synonyms include Phallus <unk> , published by Miles Berkeley in 1842 based on collections made by Charles Darwin in Maldonado ( Uruguay ) in 1833 , and Ithyphallus <unk> , a new combination based on Berkeley 's name , published by Diederich Franz Leonhard von <unk> in 1933 . 
 The specific epithet phalloides means phallus @-@ like , and refers to the similarity of the volva to the genus Phallus . Battarrea phalloides is commonly known as the " scaly @-@ stalked puffball " and the " sandy <unk> " ; a common name given to the species B. stevenii is the " desert drumstick " . In Cyprus , it is known locally as " Donkey fungus " , a name that may be derived from the fact that the spores were once used as a natural antiseptic and <unk> agent applied to the backs of donkeys , or for their morphological resemblance to the animal 's penis . 
 Historically , there has been uncertainty as to whether the European species known as Battarrea stevenii is a unique species or merely a polymorphic variant of B. phalloides . The taxon has been described as both a variety ( as B. phalloides var. stevenii by Cleland and Cheel in 1916 ) and as a form ( as B. phalloides f. stevenii by Calonge in 2004 ) . In 1995 , mycologist Roy Watling opined that B. stevenii differs in having spores that are colored more orange @-@ tawny , slightly larger ( 5 – 6 @.@ 5 by 5 @.@ 75 – 7 µm , as opposed to 4 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 25 by 4 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 75 µm ) , and less ornamented . Further , B. stevenii is thought to have a larger fruit body size , a more coarsely scaly stipe , and lack of mucilage in the volva and the innermost parts of the stem . The presence or absence of mucilage has been traditionally considered the significant characteristic separating the species . In 1904 , <unk> <unk> proposed the idea of a single polymorphic species ; in 1942 , Paul Marshall Rea , after studying 25 specimens from southern California , concluded that B. stevenii was conspecific with B. phalloides and represented a single species . An analysis of a number of European specimens — using both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics in addition to molecular analysis of ITS regions of the 5.8S rDNA — also suggested both to be conspecific . The authors of this study considered the differences in spore ornamentation and stipe hyphae to be insufficient to discriminate them as two species ; they did , however , note that their inability to locate the type material for both species limited the conclusiveness of their suggestion . The conspecificity of the species was supported in a later study that used traditional and molecular methods to compare field @-@ collected English specimens and an extensive range of herbarium material collected from around the world . They found that material labeled B. stevenii generally had a greater range of cap and stem sizes , while that labeled B. phalloides was generally more consistent , and smaller . However , the B. phalloides material they studied was generally from similar habitats in the UK , while the B. stevenii material originated from a wide variety of locales and habitats , suggesting that environmental factors influence fruit body morphology . Evidence pointing to conspecificity included the continuum of spore sizes between the two , and the lack of any significant differences between their DNA . In 2006 , however , based on a study of specimens collected in China , other scientists considered them to be independent species . 
 = = Description = = 
 Mature specimens of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature of stem and cap . However , rather than a cap with gills , this species has a spore sac atop the stem . When young , the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall ( exoperidium ) that later splits in a <unk> fashion ( along a circular or equatorial line ) , the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall . The upper part rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece , exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores . The spores are sticky . As these are carried away by the wind , the drying action of the latter cause the edges of the peridium to shrivel and roll up more , exposing more spores . This is continued until the upper half of the peridium has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few spores , which may be washed away by rain . 
 The fruit body develops rapidly ; when mature , it is rust @-@ colored , with a hemispherical to somewhat conical " head " 1 to 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 2 in ) in diameter , and with a stalk up to 40 cm ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) long by 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 6 in ) thick . 
 One study reported a specimen found in Mexico with a length of 65 cm ( 25 @.@ 6 in ) . Typically , the spore case is 3 to 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 0 in ) broad by 1 to 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 4 in ) tall . The hollow stalk is pale brown to brown , woody , and has a fibrous , scaly , or even woolly surface . The mature gleba , which is eventually exposed when the peridial cap is shed , has a rust @-@ brown color . The cap may persist after the spore mass is dispersed and form a disc @-@ like unit that slides down the stalk like a ring . The fragile sac @-@ shaped volva is up to 15 by 13 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 by 5 @.@ 1 in ) broad , unattached to the stalk , and formed by two distinct , separated tissue layers . The inner layer resembles the scales of the stem , consisting of hyphae that are 3 – 18 µm in diameter , closely arranged ( nearly parallel ) , septate , sparsely branched , yellowish ochre , with clamps at some septa . The outer layer of fungal tissue is thicker , membranous , sometimes with a corky texture when dry , and dirty white . It consists of pale yellow intertwined hyphae that are difficult to distinguish individually , and without remains of a gelatinous matrix . Fruit bodies may persist for several months after they have dried . 
 The thick @-@ walled spores are roughly spherical , rusty @-@ brown , finely and densely warted , and have diameters of 5 – 6 @.@ 5 µm . <unk> are 50 – 80 by 4 – 6 µm , and have ring @-@ like or spiral thickenings . The endoperidium consists of densely interwoven hyphae that are 3 – 9 µm in diameter and walls less than 1 µm thick ; they are septate , branched , pale yellow , with clamp connections . 
 The gleba is largely made up of two types of threads . The <unk> has hyphae up to 5 µm diameter , mostly thin walled , smooth , septate , sparsely branched , hyaline to pale yellow , with clamps . The elaters have diameters of 3 @.@ 5 – 7 µm and are 32 – 70 µm long ; they are pale yellow , smooth @-@ walled , tapered and cylindrical with spiral thickenings . <unk> elaters are <unk> and not branched . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Battarrea phalloides ( as well as Battarrea stevenii ) is typically described as unknown edibility , or inedible . In Cyprus , the immature egg @-@ form of the fruit body is eaten . Older specimens may smell unpleasant . The spores of B. stevenii are used as a <unk> — a product that promotes healing through the formation of scar tissue – by the Criollo herdsmen of Gran Chaco in northern Argentina . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The closely related species Battarrea <unk> is known in the United States from the Mojave desert , and differs from B. phalloides in that the spore sac emerges by ripping through the top of the exoperidium , rather than by <unk> rupture . The endoperidium of B. <unk> is also smaller , and the spores emerge through a number of pores on the upper surface of the spore sac . Battarrea stevenii can grow taller , up to 70 centimeters ( 27 @.@ 6 in ) . Podaxis pistillaris , commonly known as the " desert shaggy mane " , occurs in dry locales similar to B. phalloides , but can be distinguished by its shaggy , elongated cap . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Battarrea phalloides may be found growing solitary to scattered on dry , sandy hedgebanks ( raised or mounded boundary feature , often topped by a hedgerow ) , sometimes growing amongst elm suckers . It is a relatively rare species , but may be locally abundant in some locations . In Mexico , where it is only known from the north and central part of the country , it has been usually collected in arid and semiarid areas , on coastal dunes , found from sea level up to 2 @,@ 550 m ( 8 @,@ 370 ft ) high . The mushroom has been associated with the quick @-@ growing evergreen tree Schinus molle , as well as <unk> brevipes , Solanum <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Atriplex linearis , Quercus agrifolia and Opuntia species , in coastal dunes . The largest fruit bodies were found on floodplains with halophilic ( i.e. , thriving in high @-@ salt conditions ) vegetation . In Belgium , specimens were found on sandy soil under dead elderflower bushes . 
 In North America , Battarrea phalloides has been collected from the Yukon Territory , western Canada ; the USA , where it is confined to the west — Southern California , New Mexico , and Arizona — Mexico , and Hawaii . It has also been reported growing in South America ( Brazil ) , Africa ( Morocco ) , Europe ( Belgium ) , China , and Australia . Due to a decline in sightings , B. phalloides was granted legal protection in Hungary in 2005 , making it a finable offense to pick them . It received similar protected status in the United Kingdom in 1998 . 
 The habitat and range of Battarrea stevenii include arid regions of the western and southwestern United States , Australia , South Africa , and several European countries , including Russia . 
 = From This Moment On ( Shania Twain song ) = 
 " From This Moment On " is a song by Canadian recording artist Shania Twain , taken from her third studio album , Come On Over ( 1997 ) . The song was written by Twain , while additional production and songwriting was done by Robert John " Mutt " Lange . After finishing the track , both Twain and Lange concluded that the song would work best as a duet . Despite their first choice for the duet being Elton John , they chose country singer Bryan White instead , who took the opportunity . It was then released on March 14 , 1998 in North America and Oceania . 
 " From This Moment On " is a country pop track which received generally favorable reviews from music critics , who deemed it as one of the album 's highlights . The song achieved moderate commercial success , reaching the top ten in Australia , Canada , United Kingdom and United States . It also charted in France , Netherlands , New Zealand , and Sweden , as well on several Billboard component charts . An accompanying music video was directed by Paul Boyd , which depicts Twain walking on a hallway until she 's joined by an orchestra to perform the song . " From This Moment On " has been performed on every tour by Twain since its release .

 " From This Moment On " was written during a soccer game in Italy . Twain once explained “ We were in Italy at a soccer game . My husband loves sports . I don ’ t know the game that well , so my mind drifted and I started writing . ” Initially , Twain thought " From This Moment On " would be perfect for singer Celine Dion ; however , as Twain and Lange developed the song , they concluded that it would work best as a duet . Despite their first choice for the duet being Elton John , they chose country singer Bryan White instead , who took the opportunity . Twain later described White as " the best male voice in country music . Beyond country music ! He 's an excellent singer . So he needed to be on this record , because the song soars . It demands that . It demands dynamics . " White explained that , by the time he went to the recording , the song was mostly finalized , and , vocally , described it as " extremely challenging . " 
 Initial first @-@ run pressings of the international version of Come On Over during March 1998 featured White on the song , while subsequent pressings soon after began featuring the song as a solo recording . The reason is because in early 1998 , Mercury executives were informed that White would be unable to promote the song alongside Twain ; therefore Twain had to return to the studio to re @-@ record White 's parts on her own . According to White 's spokesman at Asylum Records , " We 've certainly heard knocking on our door about " From This Moment On " being too contemporary for Bryan 's sake . So it 's fine if they want to go to top 40 without him . " White later claimed that he had no hard feelings towards Twain for him being excluded from the international version of the song , stating " They 're releasing this song as a pop record , and I 'm not a pop artist , so my feelings aren 't hurt . " 
 " From This Moment On " was released as the fourth single from Come On Over on March 14 , 1998 in North America and Oceania , while being released in Europe on November 16 , 1998 only . Musically , " From This Moment On " is a country pop ballad and is set in common time with a slow tempo of 72 beats per minute . The song is written in the key of G major with Twain 's vocal range spanning from the low note of D3 to the high note of C5 . Nick Reynolds of BBC Music described the song as a power new country ballad with " a beautiful melody " .

Everyone feels their insides tug as they listen to this heart wrenching song . " Country Universe writer Kevin John Coyne did separate reviews for " From This Moment On " . While reviewing the duet , Coyne graded it a B and commented that it was mostly a showcase of White 's vocals , " who turns in some signature licks and makes Twain seem a bit bland in comparison . However , it also gives the song a bit of a mid @-@ eighties Peter <unk> vibe , which hasn ’ t held up well over time . " Coyne concluded , however , that the single release turned the track " into a potent solo number , " and noted that " the addition of a Spanish @-@ flavored guitar that borrowed heavily from ' Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman ' gave the ballad added oomph . " He graded the single release an A- . At the 1999 Canadian Country Music Awards , " From This Moment On " won the award for Vocal / Instrumental Collaboration of the Year .

 = Trams in Adelaide = 
 Until 1958 , Trams in Adelaide formed a network spanning most of suburban Adelaide , with a history dating back to 1878 . Adelaide ran horse trams from 1878 to 1914 and electric trams from 1909 , but has primarily relied on buses for public transport since 1958 . Electric trams and trolleybuses were Adelaide 's main public transport throughout the life of the electric tram network . All trams except the Glenelg Tram were closed in the 1950s . The Glenelg line remains in operation and was upgraded and extended in 2007 @-@ 2010 . 
 The early use of trams was for recreation as well as daily travel , by entire families and tourists . Until the 1950s , trams were used for family outings to the extent that the Municipal Tramways Trust ( MTT ) constructed gardens in the suburb of Kensington Gardens , extending the Kensington line to attract customers . By 1945 the MTT was collecting fares for 95 million trips annually — 295 trips per head of population . 
 After the Great Depression , the maintenance of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered . Competition from private buses , the MTT 's own bus fleet and the growth of private car ownership all took patrons from the tram network . By the 1950s , the tram network was losing money and being replaced by an electric and petrol @-@ driven bus fleet . Adelaide 's tram history is preserved by the volunteer @-@ run the Adelaide Tramway Museum at St Kilda ( commonly called the " St Kilda tram museum " ) , and the continuing use of 1929 H type trams on the remaining Glenelg tram line . 
 The Glenelg Tram was extended to Adelaide railway station in 2007 and to Adelaide Entertainment Centre in Hindmarsh in 2010 . The upgrade included the first new tram purchases in more than 50 years . Three types of electric tram , built in 1929 , 2006 and 2009 respectively , now run on the line . 
 = = Horse trams = = 
 In early 1855 , less than twenty years after the colony was founded , South Australia 's first horse tram began operating between <unk> and Port Elliot on the Fleurieu Peninsula . Just over twenty years later Adelaide became the first city in Australia to introduce horse trams , and eventually the last to discard them for more modern public transport . Although two trials of street level trains were run , the state of Adelaide 's streets , with mud in winter and dust in summer , led to the decision that they would not be reliable . 
 Sir Edwin T. Smith and W. C. <unk> , both prominent in Kensington and Norwood Corporation then Adelaide City Council ( and both later mayors of Adelaide , spent some time inspecting European tramways during the 1870s . They were impressed with horse tram systems and , on returning to Adelaide , they promoted the concept leading to a prospectus being issued for the Adelaide and Suburban Tramway Co . ( A & ST ) . Private commercial interests lobbied government for legislative support , over Adelaide council 's objections related to licensing and control . As a result , the Government of South Australia passed an 1876 private act , authorising construction of Adelaide 's first horse tram network . It was scheduled for completion within two years , with 10 @.@ 8 miles ( 17 @.@ 4 km ) of lines from Adelaide 's city @-@ centre to the suburbs of Kensington and North Adelaide . Completed in May 1878 , services began in June from Adelaide to Kensington Park with trams imported from John Stephenson Co. of New York , United States . 
 Until 1907 all horse tram operations were by private companies , with the government passing legislation authorising line construction . Growth of the network and rolling stock was driven largely by commercial considerations . On the opening day , the newly founded Adelaide and Suburban Tramway Co . ( A & ST ) began with six trams , expanding to 90 trams and 650 horses by 1907 with its own tram manufacturing facility at Kensington . 
 A Private act , passed in September 1881 , allowed the construction of more private horse tramways and additional acts were passed authorising more line construction and services by more companies . Most of the companies operated double @-@ decker tram , although some were single level cabs with many built by John Stephenson Co . , Duncan and Fraser of Adelaide , and from 1897 by the A & ST at Kensington . The trams ran at an average speed of 5 miles per hour ( 8 km / h ) , usually two horses pulling each tram from a pool of four to ten . 
 = = = Horse tram network = = = 
 Various companies expanded the network from its initial line to Kensington , with eleven companies operating within six years , three more having already failed before constructing tracks . The Adelaide to North Adelaide line opened in December 1878 , a separate one from Port Adelaide to Albert Park in 1879 , Adelaide to Mitcham and Hindmarsh in 1881 , Walkerville 1882 , Burnside , Prospect , Nailsworth and Enfield in 1883 , and Maylands in 1892 . Various streets were widened especially for the tram lines including Brougham place , North Adelaide by 10 feet ( 3 m ) and Prospect road to a total width of 60 feet ( 18 m ) . 
 All but one line was built in 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) standard gauge with the exception from Port Adelaide to Albert Park . This line was built in 5 ft 3 in ( 1 @,@ 600 mm ) to accommodate steam engines , also requiring some of the line to be raised on embankments to avoid swampy ground and flooding . There were 74 miles ( 119 km ) of tramlines with 1062 horses and 162 cars by 1901 and isolated lines from Port Adelaide to Albert Park and Glenelg to Brighton , as well as a network joining many suburbs to Adelaide 's CBD by 1907 . 
 The network had termini in Henley Beach , Hindmarsh , Prospect , Nailsworth , Paradise , Magill , Burnside , Glen Osmond , Mitcham , Clarence Park , Hyde Park and Walkerville . To accommodate the specific needs of horses , most streets were left unsealed . The horses ' urine needed an unsealed surface for absorption and their hooves a soft surface for good traction . 
 = = Electric trams = = 
 Adelaide 's first experiment with electric powered trams was a demonstration run on the Adelaide and Hindmarsh Tramway company 's line . A battery powered tram fitted with " Julien 's Patent Electric Traction " ran in 1889 to Henley Beach . The trial was unsuccessful due to the batteries poor capacity , and the promoters ' deaths in a level crossing accident shortly after precluded further experiments . 
 As with horse trams , commercial interests pursued government support for the introduction of electric tramways . The most influential was the " Snow scheme " , promoted by Francis H. Snow largely on behalf of two London companies , British Westinghouse and Callender 's Cable Construction . The scheme involved the purchase of major horse tramways , merging into an electric tramway company with twenty @-@ one years of exclusive running rights . Legislation was passed in 1901 , a referendum held in 1902 , but the required funds had been spent and the scheme collapsed . Adelaide 's council proposed their own scheme backed by different companies , but couldn 't raise the required capital , and J.H. Packard promoted various plans of his own devising that also never eventuated . 
 By 1901 Adelaide 's horse trams were seen by the public as a blot on the city 's image . With a population of 162 @,@ 000 the slow speed of the trams , and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity , made them inadequate for public transport needs . The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer . The 10 pounds of manure each horse left behind daily , was also not well regarded . Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies . A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced that the government had purchased all of the city tramways for £ 280 @,@ 000 . Bill <unk> , passed 22 December 1906 , created the Municipal Tramways Trust ( MTT ) with the authority to build new and purchase existing tramways . 
 Not all tramway companies were purchased , as the Glenelg to Marino company continued operating separately until its failure in 1914 . The government purchased the properties , plant and equipment of existing tramways but did not purchase the companies themselves . The equipment included 162 trams , 22 other vehicles and 1056 horses . By 1909 at the launch of Adelaide 's electric tram services there remained 163 horse trams and 650 horses under the control of the MTT . 
 Due to the time required to electrify the network the MTT continued to run horse trams until 1914 . The cost of purchasing the tramways was funded by treasury bills and the act capped total construction costs at £ 12 @,@ 000 per mile of track . £ 457 @,@ 000 was let in contracts to March 1908 for construction of the tramways , trams , strengthening the Adelaide bridge over the River Torrens and associated works . The official ceremony starting track construction was in May 1908 , with tracks originally laid on Jarrah sleepers . 
 On Monday 30 November 1908 there were two trial runs , from the MTT 's depot on Hackney Road to the nearby Adelaide Botanic Garden and back , the evening trial carrying the Premier and Governor . At the official opening ceremony on 9 March 1909 , Electric Tram 1 was driven by Mrs. Price , wife of Premier Thomas Price . Mrs Price opened the tramway and drove the tram from the Hackney Depot to Kensington and back , assisted by the MTT 's chief engineer .

 The MTT was created in 1906 and became part of the State Transport Authority in 1975 . It was created as a tax @-@ exempt body with eight members , mostly by appointed local councils but with some government appointees . They established a 9 acres ( 3 @.@ 6 ha ) tram depot site near the corner of Hackney Road and Botanic Road with a depot building , twenty @-@ four incoming tracks and a large administration office . William George Toop Goodman was appointed as its first engineer , later general manager and remained as general manager until his 1950 retirement . 
 To cater for family outings the MTT constructed gardens in the current suburb of Kensington Gardens , extending the Kensington line to attract customers . By 1945 the MTT was collecting fares for 95 million trips annually , representing 295 trips per head of population ( 350 @,@ 000 ) . 
 By 1958 the tram network was reduced to just the Glenelg line ( see Decline of the network ) . The MTT continued to operate most of the local bus routes in the inner metropolitan area . In 1975 the services of the MTT became the Bus and Tram division of the State Transport Authority and the MTT ceased to exist . 
 = = = Electric tram network = = = 
 At the 1909 opening , 35 miles ( 56 kilometres ) of track had been completed with electricity supplied by the Electric Lighting and Supply Co . The electric tram system ran on 600 Volts DC supplied at first from two converter stations , No.1 converter station on East Terrace with 2 @,@ 500 kW of AC to DC capacity and No.2 station at <unk> with a capacity of 900 kW . To cope with variable loads on the system , very large storage lead – acid batteries were installed , the initial one at East Terrace comprising 293 cells and a 50 ton tank of sulphuric acid . 
 The Adelaide @-@ Glenelg line was , from 1873 , a 5 ft 3 in ( 1 @,@ 600 mm ) steam railway that ran at street level into Victoria Square . Originally privately owned it was taken over by the South Australian Railways then transferred to the MTT in 1927 . The line was closed to be rebuilt to 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) standard gauge , electrified at 600 Volts DC and converted to tramway operation , reopening in late 1929 . 
 The Port Adelaide line , which until that time had still used horse trams , began to be converted to electric operation in 1914 and opened 3 April 1917 A line from Magill to Morialta opened in 1915 for weekend tourist traffic with only a single return service on weekdays . The line ran in the valley of 4th creek , a tributary of the River Torrens , across farmland and along unmade and <unk> roads . 
 All services on the Morialta line were replaced by buses in 1956 . The last tram line built in Adelaide was the Erindale line which opened in early 1944 . At maximum extent the lines connected Adelaide with the sea at Henley Beach , Grange and Glenelg , reached the base of the Adelaide Hills at Morialta and Mitcham and had Northern and Southern limits of Prospect and Colonel Light Gardens .

 From 1908 to 1909 , a hundred electric trams were manufactured by Duncan and Fraser of Adelaide at a cost of approximately £ 100 each . Up to its last tram purchase in 1953 , the MTT commissioned over three hundred electric trams , some of which have been kept in service for over seventy @-@ five years . TransAdelaide , the publicly owned company now operating Adelaide trams , began introducing a new type of tram in January 2006 in the form of the Bombardier Flexity Classic . Another new series of trams ( Alstom Citadis ) started to enter service in December 2009 . 
 * The original 103 was damaged during shipping from Germany . In its damaged form , it is now held for parts at TransAdelaide 's Glengowrie depot . The replacement 103 was the final tram that was delivered , and is now in service . Type 100 Note : The Type 100 trams are occasionally referred to a S type trams due to their resemblance to <unk> 's S class trams in use in Frankfurt am Main or <unk> trams which is the designation used in Dortmund 
 * The 6 Citadis trams in Adelaide were originally purchased for use in Madrid by <unk> / MetroLigero for use on their system as part of an order for 70 Citadis trams . At the time of arrival , these 6 cars ( along with several others ) were deemed surplus to requirements and were placed in store from new . TransAdelaide acquired 6 cars ( originally numbered 165 - 170 ) and were subsequently shipped to Australia and renumbered 201 - 206 in the TransAdelaide fleet .

 Type A trams were the most common on the newly opened lines with seventy of the initial hundred trams made in this single truck combination style . They incorporated a closed central saloon and open crossbenches on the same tram . Capable of up to 22 miles per hour ( 35 km / h ) , they had a seating capacity of twenty in the saloons with an additional twenty in the open benches . The bodies were made by Duncan and Fraser , who had built horse tram cars for the AS & T as well as bodies of electric trams for Melbourne service . All 70 A type trams were originally fitted with Brill Winner style seats in the saloon section but in 1937 , 20 cars ( numbers unknown ) had their seats replaced with Hale Kilburn fixed rattan seats , removed out of the 20 C type cars . The removed A type seats were then fitted into the C type trams . These trams were never fitted with airbrakes throughout their service lives and instead used a handbrake for normal use and a magnetic track brake for emergency use . 
 On 9 March 1909 the first type A was the lead car in the procession at the tramway systems official opening . From 1917 , 6 A type trams were used on the isolated Port Adelaide system which closed in 1935 . During the last part of 1936 , tram 100 was briefly renumbered 100A , E1 type tram 101 having been temporarily renumbered 100 for its part in the South Australian Centenary celebrations in 1936 ( more details in the E1 type section ) . A type 100 had its original number restored soon after . Most were removed from the lines and stored in the 1930s , returning to service in 1941 due to petrol rationing increasing passenger numbers . Fifty @-@ eight were permanently joined in " Bib and Bub " ( named after comic characters by May Gibbs ) pairs to conserve manpower and used this way until 1950 . Although the bib and <unk> pairs still required a conductor per tram to collect fares , they needed only one driver per pair resulting in a twenty @-@ five percent reduction in labour . All type As were withdrawn from service by May 1952 , with the formerly coupled trams being the last to go . Tram 30 was withdrawn from service three months earlier in February 1952 after sustaining accident damage . Many were sold for use as shacks , although trams 10 , 69 and 92 had been sold in 1936 to the State Electricity Commission of Victoria . 
 The 58 A type trams that were coupled into the ' Bib and Bub ' sets were formed as follows : 1 / 2 , 4 / 5 , 6 / 12 , 8 / 9 , 11 / 13 , 14 / 16 , 17 / 18 , 19 / 20 , 21 / 23 , 22 / 24 , 25 / 26 , 27 / 28 , 29 / 30 , 61 / 64 , 62 / 65 , 66 / 68 , 70 / 72 , 71 / 74 , 73 / 75 , 76 / 78 , 77 / 79 , 80 / 81 , 82 / 83 , 84 / 86 , 85 / 88 , 87 / 89 , 90 / 91 , 94 / 95 , 97 / 98 . 
 = = = = Type A1 = = = = 
 Seventeen B type ' <unk> ' trams were rebuilt by Duncan and Fraser ( though it is believed that car 45 was rebuilt in house by the MTT at Hackney Workshops ) were converted into A1 type ' California Combination ' trams , similar to the A and later C types although the ends didn 't drop down on the A1s . They were converted primarily for the isolated Port Adelaide tram system which was run by the MTT and ran between 1917 and 1935 . These trams retained their previous B type numbers ( refer to fleet table above ) . All cars had Hale Kilburn fixed rattan seating in the saloon except for car 44 which had wooden seats running along the sides of the saloon . Wooden seating was fitted to the open ends and these cars had the same passenger capacity ( seated as well as ' crush load ' ) as the A type . These trams were never fitted with airbrakes throughout their service lives and instead used a handbrake for normal use and a magnetic track brake for emergency use . 
 All of these cars entered service on the Port Adelaide tram system from 1917 and ran in service there until final closure of the system in 1935 . Several were withdrawn from service after closure and were stored in Port Adelaide depot , then transferred to Hackney Depot / Workshops until they were scrapped . After closure of the Port Adelaide system , a few A1 type trams managed to see quite varied ' inoperable ' use by the MTT . Car 44 was used as a first aid room at Hackney Depot between 1946 and 1961 . Cars 45 , 48 and 52 were used as store rooms at Hackney Workshops to house the spare parts originally ordered for the proposed H1 fleet , a ' service ' they finished in 1954 . Car 47 was used as a lunch room at Hackney Workshops while car 50 was partly converted into a ' driver instruction ' car in the early 1950s . The work involved mounting the body of car 50 onto the underframe and running gear of sprinkler car S2 . This work was however never completed . A few of the A1 type trams managed to see further service after the closure of the Port Adelaide system and were transferred to the main system . Like the A type , 4 A1 type trams were converted into coupled sets known as ' Bib and Bub ' sets . The trams involved were 55 / 56 and 57 / 58 . These cars were the last A1 type trams to be withdrawn from service in November 1950 along with the sets of A type trams not converted back into single car operation . They were subsequently scrapped . 
 = = = = Type A2 = = = = 
 The A2 type trams were again converted from B type ' toast rack ' trams and also entered service on the Port Adelaide tram system in 1917 , although the conversion work was this time undertaken in house by the MTT at Hackney Workshops . Unlike the A1 type which had traditional wooden sides , the A2 type trams had flat steel plates fitted and rivetted to the sides forming the saloon . Unlike the A , A1 and C types , the A2s had three large windows instead of 5 as per the other types . Despite the different body work for the saloon section , the seating and standing capacity for these trams were the same as the A , A1 and C types . These trams were never fitted with airbrakes throughout their service lives and instead used a handbrake for normal use and a magnetic track brake for emergency use . 
 The A2 type were introduced for service onto the Port Adelaide system in 1917 and ran until closure of the system in the 1930s . However , they were transferred to Hackney Workshops where they remained until 1946 . During that year , the bodies of 41 and 43 were sold ( and eventually found their way to the Fleurieu Peninsula , where they reportedly still remain ) but 42 was retained at Hackney Workshops so it could store advertising material . It remained in this capacity until 1958 when it was made available to the <unk> ( St Kilda Tramway Museum ) for eventual restoration . It has since been rebuilt into its original B type configuration . 
 = = = = Type B = = = = 
 Thirty of the initial trams became known as Toast rack trams due to their open structure . They were open trams with passengers seated on cross @-@ benches , and no weather protection on the cars ' sides . Duncan and Fraser built them with summer excursions in mind but they had limited utility due to the lack of weather proofing . These trams were never fitted with airbrakes throughout their service lives and instead used a handbrake for normal use and a magnetic track brake for emergency use . 
 Twenty of the cars were converted to combination trams in 1917 and redesignated as types A1 and A2 . B type 38 was rebuilt in 1929 as a ballast motor for use on the Glenelg line conversion . The rebuild involved removal of the entire body work and most of the end cabins with the trolley pole mounted on a steel pole in the middle of the now all flat deck . All type B , A1 or A2 cars , except for trams 38 and 42 , were withdrawn from service in 1936 and scrapped in 1946 . Some vehicles ( including 42 ) found other uses around Hackney depot such as store rooms and even as a fuel tank in the case of B 38 which was converted to that use after some years as a ballast motor . 
 = = = = Type E = = = = 
 Due to public antipathy to imported trams , type E trams were built by J.G. Brill & Co in Philadelphia , United States , then imported in parts and assembled by Pengelley & Co of Adelaide from 1910 to 1912 . They were partially open trams with passengers sitting on cross bench seats and a closed saloon at one end . As combination trams , the E type could carry 54 seated passengers with a total ' crush load ' of 150 . In 1918 , all 20 E type cars were <unk> with more powerful GE 201 traction motors ( rated at 65 hp each ) replacing the original GE 202 units ( rated at 50 hp each ) . The original traction motors were used in the construction of the 20 C type ' Desert Gold ' cars which were being built at the same time . 
 Their main use was on the Glen Osmond and St Peters routes , also taking picnic parties to Burnside and Magill . Type E trams were rebuilt into type E1 in 1936 . Tram 118 was acquired by the St Kilda Tramway Museum as an E1 type but is currently being converted back to its original E type configuration as well as being returned to operational order . 
 = = = = Type E1 = = = = 
 When converted from Type E trams , the crossbenches were removed and the saloon extended the entire car length . The original timber saloon seats were transferred to the newly converted saloon section while the original saloon received new upholstered seating . One of the original crossbenches ( attached to the motorman 's bulkhead ) was retained after conversion . As before conversion , these trams were used mainly on the Glen Osmond and St Peters routes . Tram 101 was temporarily renumbered 100 , painted in ivory and gold , and used in the 1936 South Australian centenary celebrations . 
 = = = = Type D = = = = 
 Similar to Type E with crossbenches and a saloon , type D trams also had sliding doors at the end of the benches giving weather protection . Four similar cars were built in 1912 for the <unk> & Malvern Tramways Trust , Melbourne , on sold to the Hawthorn Tramways Trust then purchased by the MTT in 1925 becoming trams 191 @-@ 194 . After injuries to conductors collecting fares while standing on the <unk> , a centre isle was cut through the centre bulkhead and four of the six crossbench seats of the trams in 1934 . Trams 191 @-@ 194 had been similarly modified in Melbourne prior to their purchase by the MTT . 
 = = = = Type C = = = = 
 A planned purchase of large trams was delayed by World War I. Type C trams were small combination cars , built in 1918 – 1919 as an interim measure . They were similar in basic design to the older A type but had a more modern curved roof rather than a clerestory roof . During their construction , the old motors from the E type ( General Electric 202 motors ) were fitted to these new trams . Rated at 50 hp each compared to the 33 hp units fitted to the A types , these trams were considerably faster . 
 Due to their consequent higher speeds they became known as Desert Gold trams , after a New Zealand racehorse that had won races in Australia at the same time . This speed became useful in competition against unlicensed buses in the 1920s , and they were used in peak service until 1952 with the last use for the royal visit of 1954 . Trams 181 to 190 inclusive were allocated to the Port Adelaide system for a short period in the 1930s before closure of the system , mainly used on the Port Adelaide - Albert Park line . During the 1930s , the original Hale Kilburn seating fitted to these trams were replaced with Brill Winner seats taken out of 20 A type trams ( numbers unknown ) . 
 One of the Type C Trams has found a home at Port Parham and been in the possession of the Jenkin family since the 1950s . Its number was 190 . It retains many of the fittings internally . Photo taken and provided by Michael Jenkin . This is an infrared photo . 
 = = = = Types F and F1 = = = = 
 The F and later F1 type trams were built between 1921 and 1929 were mostly by Pengelley & Co with three F1 type trams being built ' in house ' by the Municipal Tramways Trust at Hackney Workshops . The F series trams being built from 1921 to 1925 with the F1 series being built from 1925 to 1929 . These trams became known as ' Drop Centres ' since the centre section of the tram had been lowered in height to ease boarding and alighting . They were the first trams to be fitted with airbrakes in Adelaide and were designed so that six streams of passengers could board or alight on each side of the tram at the same time , with a large capacity and reportedly comfortable ride . The F and F1 series trams were the most common trams used in Adelaide from their introduction to the closure of the main tram network with a total of 84 of the drop centre trams built for use in Adelaide . The main difference between the two types lay in the construction of the underframe , with the F types having a combined steel and timber frame construction while the later F1 type having an all @-@ steel underframe . There were other variations in the fleet which will be detailed later on . 
 With such a number of trams in service , it should come as no surprise that a number of detail variations occurred in the fleet , only the main variations are listed here . In 1929 , cars 274 and 275 were fitted with additional air brake pipes for use in hauling the horse transport cars between the City and Morphettville Racecourse on the Glenelg line . These <unk> were later removed , most possibly after the suspension of the horse transport service in 1936 . As originally built , all the drop centre trams were built with General Electric PC5L2 and later <unk> control equipment ( except for nos 251 - 261 which had English Electric control equipment ) . However , in 1952 – 1953 , cars 259 , 260 and 261 had their English Electric control gear replaced with General Electric control gear . At the same time , 251 - 258 and 264 had English Electric controllers of a different type fitted . The original control gear from 264 ended up in the solitary H1 car , 381 . 
 While all 84 cars had completely timber seats in the drop centre section , the enclosed saloons had several different styles of seating . Cars 201 @-@ 261 all had rattan seating in the saloons except for 250 . All these cars except for 250 had imitation leather seating fitted after 1946 . 250 and 262 had <unk> seating . 263 @-@ 284 had wooden seating fitted . 
 From October 1953 , a number of F and F1 type trams were repainted from Tuscan and Cream livery into Carnation Red and Silver . The trams repainted were 201 @-@ 204 , 213 , 216 , 218 @-@ 219 , 224 @-@ 225 , 227 @-@ 231 , 246 , 248 , 254 , 256 @-@ 257 , 260 @-@ 261 , 264 @-@ 265 , 267 @-@ 269 , 271 @-@ 279 , 283 and 284 . Cars 224 , 255 and 262 all had minor variations to the livery . Most ( though not all ) of the repainted cars had an emergency exit door fitted behind the motorman 's compartment reducing the seating capacity in these trams from 60 to 56 . A few un repainted cars were also fitted with these doors . 
 Cars 201 @-@ 262 had been fitted with Brill <unk> type trucks and 263 @-@ 284 had been fitted with cast Commonwealth Steel type trucks . However , by the final year of operations in 1958 , F type cars 234 , 245 and 249 had been <unk> with the Commonwealth Steel type trucks taken off of 266 , 284 and 263 , the <unk> Fs taking the F1 numbers in that order . By this time , most of the original F type cars had been withdrawn from service . The F1 type tram was the last type of tram to see service on the main Adelaide street tramway system with F1 269 making the final run to Cheltenham and return on 22 November 1958 , Adelaide tramway operations ceasing that night with the exception of the Glenelg line .

 As a means of more economic operation over the lightly patronized Port Adelaide system , four ' Birney Safety Cars ' were constructed by J.G. Brill and were imported complete by the Municipal Tramways Trust . Numbered 301 to 304 , this small class of four trams were built with features such as folding doors and steps as well as being the only trams in Adelaide able to be operated by one man ( thereby doing away with the need for a conductor ) . These were the only trams built new for the Port Adelaide system , the other trams in the fleet allocated to Port Adelaide being either transferred from the main system or converted from the B type toast rack trams ( into A1 and A2 types ) . Until the arrival of the Flexity and Citadis trams over 80 years later , these were also the only trams in Adelaide to be entirely constructed overseas . Introduced into service from December 1925 , these four trams only ran on the Port Adelaide system for 10 years before the system was completely closed in July 1935 . 
 In January and February 1936 , the four were sold to the State Electricity Commission of Victoria for use in Geelong and were renumbered 27 to 30 in the SEC Geelong fleet and joined two other Birney trams acquired from new for use in Geelong making 6 in all there . In 1947 , the four former Adelaide ' Birney ' trams were transferred to Bendigo to operate on the tramway system there , also owned by the State Electricity Commission . The two Geelong ' Birney ' cars were also transferred to Bendigo arriving in 1949 . While in service in Bendigo , these trams ran in revenue service until 1972 when the system was closed down , with part of the track retained by the Bendigo Trust for tourist operation . All 6 of the ' Birney ' trams that made it to Victoria have all been preserved in operational condition with former Adelaide tram 303 returning to South Australia in 1976 . 
 = = = = Type H = = = = 
 Known as Glenelg trams , The Hs are a long rigid body tram that is end loading with a full length saloon and were built by Pengelley and Co in 1929 specifically for the Glenelg line , they commenced operations on 14 December 1929 . Incredibly , 4 of the cars remained in limited heritage service on the Glenelg line at the start of 2009 , nearly 80 years after they were introduced . They also saw service on the Henley North , Kensington Gardens and Cheltenham routes until their closure . They were built with Tomlinson automatic couplers and were also fitted with General Electric PC5L2 control gear and could be operated in multiple , either in pairs or until 1937 , as triple car sets . After a few years in service , they were also fitted with air horns . Although specifically designed for use on the Glenelg line , the H type trams saw service from 1935 on the Henley North line and then on the Kensington line from 1952 . 
 A total of 30 H cars were built for service on the Glenelg line with the first cars ( 351 and 352 ) being run under trial for the first time in October 1929 , these two cars opening the line on 14 December 1929 . Until February 1937 , some services on the line were run with triple @-@ car sets until an accident at <unk> ( now called Glengowrie ) which saw the practice discontinued . 
 During the 1930s , 5 H type were experimentally fitted with pantographs of 5 different patterns . 376 was fitted with a <unk> Schukert pantograph , 377 was fitted with a Fischer bow collector , 378 was fitted with an ASEA pantograph , 379 was fitted with a Metropolitan Vickers pantograph and 380 was fitted with an English Electric pantograph . The pantographs on 376 , 379 and 380 were all fitted on a small pantograph tower while 377 and 378 had their pantographs mounted on the roof itself . During the experiments , the pantographs were only used on the reserve track section which at the time was fitted with a railway @-@ like catenary overhead system rather than the traditional tramway @-@ style overhead used on the rest of the system . Because the overhead at the time was not staggered to suit pantograph operation , the pantographs fitted all suffered from uneven wear and as a result the experiment ceased . Ironically , all the surviving H type trams were fitted with pantographs 50 years later in October 1986 . 
 The next major round of changes to the H types occurred in the 1950s , starting in <unk> with a repainting of most of the fleet from the traditional Tuscan and Cream to a new Carnation Red and Silver livery with an Ashbury Green interior which had been completed by the end of the decade . The first H types to be withdrawn from service were also taken out of service during the time ( 352 in December 1957 and the first 380 in May 1959 . 351 was renumbered 380 at this time ) . This was the first in a series of renumberings of the H cars , designed to keep a consecutively numbered fleet for <unk> purposes ( i.e. 363 @-@ 364 or 371 @-@ 372 ) . A table of the renumbered cars is listed further down . During 1956 , the entire fleet had their original Dick Kerr motors replaced with English Electric motors originally intended for the H1 fleet . In 1968 , 366 and 377 ( original numbers ) were scrapped with cars 353 and 354 renumbered to replace them ( refer to renumbering table further below ) with the result that the H type fleet had been reduced to 26 cars . 
 From 1971 onwards , cars 351 , 357 , 358 , ( 2nd ) 363 , ( 2nd ) 366 , 367 , 368 , 369 , 370 , 371 , 372 , 373 , 374 , 375 , 376 , ( 2nd ) 377 , 379 and 380 were all refurbished and repainted into their original Tuscan and Cream livery except for 363 and 364 which originally entered service after refurbishment in an experimental Carnation Red and Grey livery in 1971 . These two were repainted into Tuscan and Cream in 1973 . Most of these cars had their original varnished timber interior restored too , although there were a few variations in the refurbishment program . 377 was also repainted into a one off black and gold livery to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Glenelg line in 1979 . 377 retained this livery for a few years afterwards . 380 was also briefly repainted in 1979 into a special livery by a number of Glenelg area students as part of the SA schools ' Come out ' festival of that year . 
 During the 1980s , most of the remaining <unk> cars ( 355 , 356 , 360 , 362 and 378 ) were disposed of , bringing the operating fleet down to 21 cars . In October 1986 , along with the opening of a new tram depot at Glengowrie , 369 became the first car to be fitted with a pantograph on a permanent basis after the overhead had been altered to make the wire ' zig sag ' to minimise wear on the pantograph . All the other cars in the fleet were subsequently fitted with pantographs and roller bearings on the trucks replacing the old plain bearings . For a short period after installation of pantographs , a trolley pole was retained at one end ' just in case ' but was finally removed soon afterwards . In 1987 , the last of the silver trams ( 361 ) was refurbished under a new program which introduced a few more modern features to the cars . Eventually , 10 H types were refurbished under the new program ( 357 , 358 , 361 , 364 , 365 , 368 , 369 , 371 , 372 and 373 ) . 
 Interestingly , 378 , which had previously been disposed of in 1986 , was repurchased and refurbished for use as a restaurant tram and was launched on 1 November 1990 as the ' Adelaide Tram Car Restaurant ' , run by a private operator . It was not successful and the tram was later purchased by TransAdelaide and renamed ' Grand Lady ' . As with the private operator , the operation was not a success under TransAdelaide . The tram was retained but very rarely used and was last seen on the mainline in 2001 . For some years it was stored at Glengowrie depot , then in 2006 it was sold to the South Australian History Trust , which made it available to the St Kilda Tramway Museum , where it has been run on occasions . 
 In 2001 and 2002 , cars 351 , 367 , 370 , 374 and 380 were again refurbished to the extent of a complete rebuild . New modern chopper controls were added replacing the original GE PC5L2 control gear . From 2007 the five trams have seen service for weekend , public holiday and charter trips . With an in service operational life of 80 years , these five trams are the oldest public transport vehicles still in service in Australia ( although 374 hasn 't been in service since 2004 after sustaining some underframe damage ) . With the purchase of replacement trams , sixteen Type H trams were disposed of with some sold , for a total of $ 65 @,@ 000 , and the remainder donated . They were destined for uses as varied as a restaurant , an attraction at a bed and breakfast boarding house and a tourism display at Glenelg , Adelaide .

 Until the arrival of the Flexity trams in 2005 , H1 type car 381 was the most modern tram in <unk> part of an order for 40 H1 type cars , 381 was just completed by JA Lawton & Sons of Adelaide when the reconstitution of the MTT caused cancellation of the remaining thirty @-@ nine cars . A partly constructed 382 was scrapped before it was completed as a result of the change in policy . Like the H type upon which 381 was based on , it was fitted with PC5L2 type controllers although in this case , they were taken out of F1 type tram 264 ( more details to be found in the F1 type section ) . Originally fitted with a standard link and pin type coupler , 381 was later fitted with a Tomlinson automatic style coupler ( although it was not able to operate in multiple with the H type ) . Power operated doors were also fitted . 
 381 ran its first trial run on 22 January 1953 and entered service the following month . For most of its short operational life , 381 was used on the Kensington and Henley North lines ( which were through routed the same year 381 was built ) . 381 was also the last tram to operate over the Kensington line before closure in February 1957 . It was withdrawn from revenue service in December 1957 when it was stored at Hackney Depot / Workshops . In June 1958 , it was then moved to City Depot on Angas Street . In May 1959 , it was again moved for further storage , this time to the permanent way depot at Maylands where it remained until 1965 when it was donated to the St Kilda Tramway Museum . As a result , it has spent many more years in preservation then it did in revenue service .

 Beginning in January 2006 , 30 metres ( 98 ft 5 in ) long , articulated , low @-@ floor Flexity Classic Light Rail vehicles , built by Bombardier in Germany , began operation . Eleven trams were ordered at a total cost of $ 58 million to replace most of the then seventy @-@ seven @-@ year @-@ old Type H trams on the Glenelg line . Bombardier won the supply tender against one other bidder , receiving an initial order for nine trams in September 2004 . , another two Flexity trams were ordered for use on the Victoria Square to City West extension , opened in October 2007 . Several of the earlier Flexity cars were unloaded at Outer Harbor in Adelaide while the later deliveries were shipped to Melbourne and offloaded there before being road hauled to Adelaide . Flexity 111 was noted running evaluation trips around parts of the Melbourne tram network before delivery to Adelaide . Station platforms were lowered to match the new trams lower floors , and some of the track and sleepers replaced to provide a smoother ride . There have been problems with the tram 's <unk> systems , during Adelaide 's very hot summer weather , but these were rectified with engineering changes to the trams . 
 Classification terminologies have been varied . The trams are generally referred to as <unk> or Flexity type by TransAdelaide , although they are also referred to as Type 100 ( from their fleet numbers ) or the Type I , following on from the MTT classification system . Other classifications deriving from designations in use on other systems with Flexity Classic trams , including S Class ( <unk> , Frankfurt ) , <unk> ( Norrköping ) and <unk> ( Dortmund ) , have also been used . 
 By 2008 the state government was considering lengthening the trams , instead of purchasing more , to accommodate increasing passenger numbers . In September 2008 , an order was placed with Bombardier for an additional 4 Flexity Classic trams to be used on the City West to Adelaide Entertainment Centre section . These have been numbered 112 – 115 . Despite being a fairly new tram , already there have been a couple of variations , most notably the constantly changing ' all @-@ over advertising ' that changes the appearance of the tram quite considerably . Vehicle 102 has also had traditional leather hand holds installed instead of rubber hand holds which are fitted to the rest of the fleet . 
 = = = = Citadis 302 / Type 200 = = = = 
 The newest trams in Adelaide are six Alstom Citadis model 302 trams which were purchased second hand from the Spanish city of Madrid . Compared to the Flexity Classic trams already in service , they have a higher ' crush loading ' ( 186 compared with 115 ) but 10 fewer seats . They are also 2 metres longer and are formed of five articulated sections rather than three . 
 Originally built as part of an order for seventy Alstom Citadis trams by Spanish operator MetroLigero for service in Madrid , six Citadis trams were acquired by TransAdelaide for service on the Glenelg line as well as to provide services for the new line to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre . Although originally planned to be used on the Madrid network , a subsequent scaling down of plans there resulted in a number of Citadis trams being placed into storage upon arrival in Madrid and never turned a wheel in service . The six trams bought by TransAdelaide came out of this stock . Five of the purchased trams had never run in Madrid and one ( MetroLigero 169 ) saw just a couple of weeks service as a demonstration tram in Stockholm ( demonstrated by the Manufacturer Alstom ) . The six trams purchased were modified at the Preston Tramway Workshops in Melbourne before arriving in Adelaide . They were renumbered from MetroLigero numbers 165 – 170 to the TransAdelaide 200 series with vehicle numbers 201 – 206 .

 During the Great Depression the MTT needed to expand services but finances prevented laying new tracks . A decision was made to trial trolleybuses , and a converted petrol bus began running experimentally on the Payneham and Paradise lines in 1932 . A permanent trolleybus system opened in 1937 , and trolleybuses continued running until July 1963 . 
 = = Decline of the network = = 
 From 1915 onwards the MTT had to compete against unregulated private buses , often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares , which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925 . The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927 , although some private operators used a provision in the Australian constitution to their advantage . By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to <unk> , Victoria ( but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner ) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some time . Up until the end of World War I , most <unk> were dependent on public transport for daily journeys . The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage ; patronage remained higher than before the war , until rationing was discontinued in 1951 . 
 From the start of the great depression until the closure of the network only one lot of trams was purchased by the MTT . Due to shortages there was minimal maintenance of the network during World War II and post @-@ war shortages prevented the purchase of new trams . In 1951 – 1952 the MTT lost £ 313 @,@ 320 and made the decision to convert the Erindale , Burnside and Linden park lines to electric trolleybuses . The last trams on these lines ran on 24 May 1952 with the lines lifted from 18 April 1953 . A 1953 royal commission was held to inquire into the financial affairs of the MTT resulting in a completely reconstituted board . Late the same year , with driver safety concerns about the conflict with increasing traffic on the road , the Glen Osmond line was temporarily converted to motor buses . The line was never converted back to trams and much comment was made about the continuing maintenance of unused overhead lines . 
 Trolley buses gradually made way for motor buses until the last electric tram or bus service ran on 12 July 1963 leaving only the Glenelg tramline as a remnant of a once extensive light rail network . Except for the Glenelg Type H , the trams were sold or scrapped . Some were used as shacks , playrooms or preserved by museums . 
 = = = Remaining line = = = 
 The Glenelg line , part of the integrated Adelaide Metro public transport network , is a 11 @.@ 9 @-@ kilometre ( 7 @.@ 4 mi ) route from the centre of Adelaide to the beachside suburb of Glenelg . Recently extended at its northern end , it is currently Adelaide 's only remaining tramway . Trams run at approximately twenty @-@ minute intervals , . Until January 2006 , Type H cars provided all services on the Glenelg line . In 2005 , the entire Glenelg line was upgraded with new track and improved tram stops , then in 2006 , eleven , thirty metre long articulated low @-@ floor Flexity Classic Light Rail vehicles , built by Bombardier in Germany , have since replaced the Type H trams in regular day @-@ to @-@ day service , although five refurbished Type H trams have been retained and operate a restricted ' heritage service ' timetable on Saturdays , Sundays and Public Holidays . They have been fitted with safety measures similar to those of the new trams , including vigilance control and electro @-@ magnetic track brakes . 
 A 1 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometre ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) extension from Victoria Square , along King William St and North <unk> opened to the public on 14 October 2007 . Further extensions were the subject of public debate . Tourism minister , Jane Lomax @-@ Smith , in 2007 , expressed support for the line to be extended to North Adelaide and Prospect although the Transport minister stated that this was not a practical option , with his preferred option the creation of a fare free city loop . 
 In the 2008 state budget , the government announced that it would extend the tram line further . The first extension , completed in early 2010 , was from the existing North Terrace terminus to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in the inner north @-@ west suburb of Hindmarsh , with a park and ride service set up on Port Road . Following the expected electrification of the Outer Harbour and Grange rail lines , new tram @-@ trains are to run to West Lakes , Port Adelaide and Semaphore by 2018 . 
 Travel on certain sections of the Glenelg line without a ticket is permitted ; the two sections being the last two stops in Glenelg and the stops from South Terrace till the Entertainment centre . Travelling outside these zones without tickets will be fined by Police or Inspectors .

 = Battle of Marion = 
 The Battle of Marion ( December 17 – 18 , 1864 ) was a military engagement fought between units of the Union Army and the Confederate Army during the American Civil War near the town of Marion , Virginia . The battle was part of Union Maj. Gen. George Stoneman 's attack upon southwest Virginia , aimed at destroying Confederate industrial infrastructure near Saltville and Marion . Union Cavalry and Infantry regiments — some 4 @,@ 500 soldiers in total — left Tennessee on December 17 for southwestern Virginia . 
 Through two days of fighting , a Confederate force under the command of John C. Breckinridge — totalling 1 @,@ 200 – 1 @,@ 500 infantry and cavalry — was successful in holding defensive positions in and around the town of Marion . On the first day , successive Union attacks were defeated by a well @-@ coordinated Confederate defenses near a covered bridge outside of Marion . By the end of the second day , dwindling ammunition supplies forced Confederate forces to withdraw from the area . With casualties for both sides approaching 300 , Union forces proceeded to destroy the salt mines , lead works , and other beneficial Confederate infrastructure in Marion and Saltville . 
 = = Background = = 
 By 1864 , the American Civil War was slowly drawing to a close . With Abraham Lincoln re @-@ elected as President of the Union , and Gen. Ulysses Grant made commander of the Union Army , the possibility of a Confederate victory was steadily lessened . Along the Eastern Seaboard , Union forces pushed the Confederate forces of Gen. Robert E. Lee steadily back in successive Union victories at Wilderness and Spotsylvania . In the Appalachian mountains , Phillip Sheridan had defeated Confederate armies in the Shenandoah valley . As Union forces pushed southward , they destroyed significant portions of the Confederate agriculture base . As Union forces defeated Confederate armies in the northern reaches of the CSA , Gen. William T. Sherman began his march to the sea , which would eventually succeed in destroying 20 % of the agricultural production in Georgia . 
 As Union forces advanced south , the infrastructure near the town of Marion — located in Southwest Virginia on the Middle Fork of the Holston River , between Saltville and Wytheville — became a major objective of Union forces . Marion itself was politically divided , with citizens fighting for the Union and the Confederacy . Until the winter of 1864 , the town 's location in a mountainous region had protected it from major fighting . In November 1864 , George Stoneman — deputy commander of the Department of the Ohio and in charge of all Union cavalry units in eastern Tennessee — proposed an expedition into southwest Virginia to disrupt the production of supplies and facilities beneficial to the Confederacy . This gained the approval of Maj. Gen. John Schofield on December 6 , 1864 . 
 = = Troops = = 
 The Union forces consisted of about 4 @,@ 500 men from a variety of different units , including several units which had participated in smaller @-@ scale raids into Southwest Virginia earlier in the conflict . The Union army was under the command of Maj. Gen. George Stoneman , Brig. Gen. Alvan Gillem , and Brig. Gen. Stephen Burbridge . The majority of the forces that would have been stationed at Marion had been transferred to the Army of Northern Virginia . The heavily scaled @-@ down Confederate forces consisted of approximately 1 @,@ 500 men , under the overall command of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge and Brig. Gen. Basil Duke . 
 = = = Union Forces = = = 
 Stoneman used troops under Brig. Gens . Alvan Gillem and Stephen Burbridge , including the 5th and the 6th U.S. Colored Cavalry Regiments — both of which had participated in the previous attempt to destroy the salt works during the First Battle of Saltville . Stoneman ordered Burbridge to bring his division of 4 @,@ 200 cavalrymen through the Cumberland Gap to join Stoneman and Gillem at Knoxville , Tennessee , where Gillem was refitting his own command into a picked force of 1 @,@ 500 men . Stoneman did not reveal the objectives of the expedition to his subordinates until three days after they had departed Knoxville on December 10 . On December 12 , Stoneman 's force flanked and forced back Confederate Brig. Gen. Basil W. Duke 's cavalry at Rogersville , Tennessee . Union forces defeated and scattered Confederate troops the next day at Kingsport , Tennessee . There Gillem captured 84 prisoners , including Col. Richard C. Morgan and the brigade 's supply train . 
 On December 14 , the Union regiments began to push Duke 's cavalry back toward Abingdon , Virginia . The next day , Stoneman and his cavalry went into camp at Glade Spring , Virginia , which was approximately 13 miles ( 21 km ) west of Marion . On December 16 , Stoneman 's cavalry advanced towards Marion , destroying infrastructure and public buildings in their path . 
 = = = Confederate Forces = = = 
 The Confederate forces were under command of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge — former Vice @-@ President of the United States , and also candidate for U.S. President in 1860 — the commander of the Department of Southwest Virginia . His command consisted of approximately 1 @,@ 000 regular troops with another 500 militia in reserve . Most of the companies had been transferred to the Army of Northern Virginia to help in the defense of Richmond . Breckinridge 's forces consisted of Colonel Henry Giltner 's brigade — formed from the soldiers of the 4th Kentucky Cavalry and the 10th Kentucky Cavalry Battalions — the 11th Kentucky Mounted Rifles — later renamed the 13th Kentucky Cavalry Battalion — and the 64th Virginia Mounted Infantry . It also included Basil Duke 's cavalry , Brig. Gen. George Cosby 's cavalry , and Col. Vincent Witcher 's 34th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry . 
 On the night of December 18 , Breckinridge and his troops moved out of Saltville , Virginia , in an effort to stem Stoneman 's advance . Taking the regular troops with him , Breckinridge left Col. Robert Preston in charge of the 500 militia men to defend the salt works . Breckinridge sent Witcher and his men of the 34th on ahead of the main force and ordered them to harass the Union forces . At about 3 a.m. , Breckinridge and his small company began to cross Walkers Mountain . In the last few days before the march , 4 inches ( 10 cm ) of rain had fallen , leaving the roads muddy and travel difficult . By about 4 a.m. , they reached the main road near Seven Mile Ford , Virginia where Breckinridge halted to wait for daylight before continuing . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Advance = = = 
 Around noon of December 17 , 1864 , Breckinridge 's men mounted their horses and rode towards Marion . Meanwhile , Stoneman sent some of his Tennessee regiments to Wytheville to destroy anything that looked valuable . Stoneman also sent two regiments of cavalry to destroy the lead mines and smelting facilities that were located about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Wytheville . 
 Stoneman and Burbridge continued on toward Marion where they encountered Witcher and his men . Burbridge 's front regiment easily pushed back Witcher 's small regiment , who stopped just so they could fire a volley into the Union cavalry . They then continued to retreat toward Marion . Witcher sent a courier to inform Breckinridge that they were coming to join them at Marion . 
 = = = First day = = = 
 Breckinridge 's front regiment was the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles , under the command of Col. Benjamin Caudill . Caudill 's men dismounted and fired into the Union cavalry , inflicting minor casualties . As the rest of Breckinridge 's troops began to arrive on the scene , Stoneman 's soldiers secured elevated positions overlooking the river . Breckinridge observed that these hills were the best defensive positions in the area , ordering his front regiments to eliminate Union resistance on the hills . The rest of Giltner 's Brigade also joined in the charge , routing the Union soldiers and allowing the Confederate forces to use the defensive positions themselves . 
 Upon losing the heightened positions , Burbridge ordered his own forces to counterattack the Confederate positions . When the Union regiments advanced on the hills , Confederate infantry and cavalry inflicted heavy casualties , slowing Burbridge 's progress . As Union forces continued to attack the hill , Maj. Richard Page — commander of the Confederate artillery squadrons at Marion — fired his battery of 10 @-@ pounder Parrott rifles , in an attempt to slow the Union charge . Taking heavy casualties , and facing heavy fire from all sides , Burbridge 's front regiments withdrew . 
 The Union officers , refusing to withdraw , reorganized their regiments and resumed the attack . As with the previous charge , the Confederate line held , repelling what remained of the Union regiments . After repelling a final charge , Confederate forces had succeeded in holding their elevated positions throughout the first day of combat . Throughout the night , Breckinridge ordered his forces to move forward and construct new barricades to receive the next day 's attacks . These new positions placed the opposing armies within 150 yards ( 140 m ) of one another . In the lull between the fighting , elements of the Union forces were ordered to take up positions at a covered bridge on the river . With 75 men advancing to positions near the bridge , both sides prepared to resume combat the following day . 
 = = = Second day = = = 
 At dawn , Union forces positioned at the covered bridge opened fire , harassing the Confederate forward positions . As the morning 's fog lifted , <unk> 's regiments attacked . Columns of Union soldiers moved across the fields , subjected to heavy defensive fire from Breckinridge 's Confederate forces . As the day progressed , a combination of Union regiments succeeded in pushing back the 4th Kentucky Infantry Regiment . Confederate counterattacks , however , succeeded in recapturing the breastwork positions . 
 As the counterattack progressed , Union forces at the covered bridge took increasing pressure from the 4th Kentucky Regiment . Realizing that the location was unprotected , the remaining Union forces attempted to withdraw to the starting lines . Confederate forces — now stationed near the covered bridge — exacted heavy casualties on retreating forces . The few Union soldiers who remained at the bridge — now caught between multiple Confederate regiments — refrained from attacking . When Union forces attempted to break through to the bridge , Confederate forces inflicted further casualties , forcing the attack to withdraw . 
 On the far right , Duke was pressed hard by columns of attacking Union soldiers . Seeing this , Col. Giltner sent his regiment to reinforce Duke . Before Giltner 's reinforcements arrived , Duke and his men counterattacked the Union line — routing it and forcing a withdrawal . Duke and Witcher then combined forces and charged the Union 's extreme left flank , inflicting significant damage on a Union colored regiment . 
 Having taken heavy casualties and losing strategic superiority , Burbridge and his men conducted a disorganized withdrawal . The Confederates had succeeded in holding the rail breastworks , yet had expended most of their ammunition in doing so . Each Confederate infantryman had fired at least seventy @-@ five rounds , with some firing significantly more . The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry . The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate force had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works . 
 = = Aftermath and significance = = 
 Breckinridge ordered his field officers to inspect the troops and to report back with the condition of his troops . The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops to a point that he judged that he could no longer hold back the Union forces at his front lines . Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling ; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece . With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman 's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon , there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future . 
 Although the vastly outnumbered Confederates had inflicted casualties and slowed the Union advance on Saltville , they were incapable of halting it . Finding their own path to Saltville 's defenses blocked , Breckinridge and his men retreated further south , while a Union company advanced . Saltville fell to a night attack on December 20 – 21 and the salt works were destroyed by the Union forces . 
 Salt had always been in short supply in Virginia and after the destruction of the salt @-@ mines became " practically nonexistent " , giving Lee 's <unk> " no means of preserving what little meat they could lay hands on ... for the hungry men in the trenches outside Petersburg and Richmond " . Additionally , damage to the lead mines near Wytheville would keep them from contributing fully to the war effort for three months . Many wells and water sources were also fouled , leading to the disruption of water supplies . Many of the railroad locomotives , cars , depots , and bridges in the vicinity were destroyed beyond repair during Stoneman 's campaign . In a memoir , Stoneman wrote that his troops captured 34 officers and 845 enlisted men during the attack into Marion , Virginia . 
 = Aquaria ( video game ) = 
 Aquaria is a 2D sidescrolling action @-@ adventure computer game designed by Alec Holowka and Derek Yu , who together form the independent game company Bit Blot , which developed and originally published the game . After more than two years of development , the game was released in 2007 for Windows . A Macintosh port was released in 2008 by Ambrosia Software , and an updated version of the game was released on Steam that same year . A Linux version of the game was released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle collection in 2010 , and a version for the iPad was released on November 2 , 2011 . More recently , an Android port of the game was released as part of the Humble Bundle with Android 6 collection in June 2013 . In 2009 , the Aquaria soundtrack album was made available for sale . It includes all of the music in the game as well as a new nine @-@ minute vocal track and a few remixes . 
 The game follows Naija , a mermaid @-@ like woman , as she explores the underwater world of Aquaria . Along her journey , she learns about both the history of the world and her own past . The gameplay focuses on a combination of swimming , singing and combat , through which Naija can interact with the world . Naija 's songs can move items , affect plants and animals , and change her physical appearance into other forms . These forms have different abilities , such as firing projectiles at hostile creatures or passing through barriers inaccessible to her in her natural form . 
 Reviews of the game were generally positive . Critics focused primarily on the visuals , music and atmosphere as particularly praiseworthy . Additional positive comments were made about the controls and gameplay , while critiques centered on the map system and a limited variety of objectives . The game won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize from the Independent Games Festival in March 2007 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Aquaria is a 2D sidescrolling action @-@ adventure game , heavily focused on exploration and puzzle @-@ solving , with non @-@ linear gameplay . The player controls Naija , a lone underwater dweller ; although similar to a human woman , Naija also has several fish @-@ like qualities , such as the ability to breathe underwater and propel herself quickly with webbed feet . The game , originally only available for personal computers , was designed to be primarily controlled solely through the mouse , though it can also be controlled with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller . The player directs Naija through an underwater world composed of several distinct regions , ranging from caves to underwater ruins to sunlit oases . These areas are filled with plant and animal life , which can be hostile , friendly , or neutral towards her . Hostile plants and animals can hurt Naija , reducing her health meter , by touching her or firing projectiles at her . 
 In general , Naija cannot interact directly with objects in the world . Instead , the majority of actions are accomplished through singing short tunes . The player does this by selecting a series of notes displayed in a circle of eight choices in the correct order . Each note corresponds with a different color . Singing notes affects plants and objects of the same color as the note , while singing the tunes , once learned through the plot , can lift objects , create a shield around Naija , or change Naija into different " forms " which have different appearances and unique abilities critical to overcoming the various challenges and obstacles found in the game . The specific tones that are played when the player selects a note can subtly change in different regions , matching the background music . The default form , or " normal form " , is the only one in which Naija can sing , and is the only one where her appearance is modifiable by the player by having Naija wear costumes found throughout the game . 
 Other forms , which can only be used once found in @-@ game , are the " energy form " , in which Naija can shoot projectiles to attack enemy creatures , " beast form " , which allows Naija to swim faster through the water and eat small fish to restore health , and " nature form " , in which Naija can shoot seeds that produce flowers and spiky plants that can harm other creatures . In this form , Naija is not harmed by thorns on any plants . The player can also learn the " sun form " , which allows Naija to give off light in dark regions , " spirit form " , which allows the player to move to specific locations marked by blue crystals without time passing , " fish form " , where Naija turns into a small , fast fish , and " dual form " , found at the end of the game , which allows Naija and another character named Li who is met late in the game 's plot to merge , with actions taken by one affecting the other . 
 While exploring the world , Naija can collect various ingredients from interaction with plants and animals , mainly by combating her foes . These ingredients can be used to cook dishes , which have varying effects on Naija . The most common effects are healing and enhancing various characteristics such as speed and defense , but there are some more exotic dishes which grant her new abilities . The player can learn new recipes by collecting new dishes directly , but can also learn them by combining ingredients without first knowing the recipe . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As the game opens , Naija has lost almost all of her memories , and is unaware of the world outside of her home as she " lives as a simple creature " . The player is told this in voice @-@ over narrations in the form of a story told by a future Naija . These narrations serve as the primary source of information about Naija throughout the game , though there are occasional cutscenes . After being confronted by a shadowy figure and being shown a series of flashbacks she does not understand , Naija awakens . Feeling loneliness as the only member of her species , Naija decides to explore the world around her . As the player explores , Naija discovers more and more about the history of the world , " Aquaria " , and about her own past . The player is not forced to go through the plotline in a set sequence . The only limiting factor is physical barriers such as areas that can only be accessed by using a specific form . Combinations of these physical limitations place some plot elements later in the game . The narrative for the majority of the game is centered on Naija 's exploration of a series of ruined civilizations that she finds , each with a large monster in them . These civilizations make up the different regions of the game . 
 Towards the end of the game , Naija discovers that all of the ruined civilizations she has found throughout the game were destroyed by a god , " the Creator " , who was jealous of the rising power of that civilization or of their gods . The powerful monsters she has found and defeated in each region were once the gods of that civilization . Each of these civilizations had a unique power , symbolized by the form that Naija learns after defeating their former gods . Along with Li , a human diver from the land she meets at the top of the ocean , Naija then descends to the bottom of the sea to confront the god . There she discovers that the Creator fell into the ocean as a child , and bonded with an ancient spirit to gain god @-@ like powers . He then created Aquaria , threading a verse of a lullaby his mother had sung to him throughout , the only part of the song he remembers . The melody of this song , the " verse " , is what allows Naija to sing songs that affect the world around her ; parts of the melody can be heard in different forms in the songs within the game 's soundtrack . 
 The Creator , after creating Aquaria , created a series of civilizations , making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed . The Creator kidnaps Li , with whom Naija has fallen in love , and she attacks the Creator to get him back . The player defeats the god as the final boss of the game , and returns home with Li . In the epilogue , Naija is shown with Li and their child . If the player has found all of Naija 's memories by discovering places she remembers , they reveal that the shadowy figure at the beginning of the game was her mother , Mia . Mia was made by the Creator and had the ability , like Naija , to use the different powers of all of the civilizations . She fled the Creator , and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession ; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija 's memory so that she would find out the history of Aquaria on her own and defeat the Creator . In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories , Mia appears , telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water . After Naija refuses , Mia kidnaps her , and vanishes ; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien , Naija and Li 's son , leaving to find her . If the player has not found all of the memories , the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past , and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son . 
 = = Development = = 
 Aquaria was developed by Derek Yu and Alec Holowka over the course of two years , off of a concept that Holowka had thought of a year prior . Yu was the lead artist , and Holowka handled the programming and audio components . Both designers had previously worked in video games ; Yu had made several freeware games , including I 'm <unk> with Holowka and others , while Holowka had worked for several video game start @-@ ups , none of which had ever gotten a game published . Some additional work on the game , including some level design and scripting for some enemies , was done by Brandon McCartin . Holowka and Yu officially formed the studio Bit Blot to back the game a week before submitting it to the 2007 Independent Games Festival . The name of the studio is intended to represent a fusion of art and technology . Aquaria is the studio 's only game . Both members of the team continue to make video games , but are not doing so as a partnership ; Holowka went on to form a separate team called Infinite Ammo , and Yu went back to working on freeware games and various ports of Spelunky . 
 The initial prototype of the game had styling similar to a text @-@ based role @-@ playing game , with a large open world and many sub @-@ quests . After moving towards " multiple @-@ choice text answers " and a complicated gameplay system , the team decided to simplify the game and set the 2007 Independent Games Festival as a deadline to complete everything . With this time pressure , they forced themselves to cut out a lot of what they felt was unneeded complexity , bringing the game to its core . After removing many of what they decided were extraneous elements they then added back in the cooking system , which they felt fit well with the rest of the game , as well as a map system . They then developed the game world and story in a roughly linear manner , creating basic designs of each region and then coming back to fill in details . They felt that this allowed them to create interesting ideas at the beginning of the game and then fill them out and resolve them at the end . One of these ideas was that of the " verse " ; Holowka realized partway through development that he had been using the same twelve @-@ note sequence transposed into different keys throughout the music , and realized that the idea of a pervasive musical theme to the world fit with the story . The game also includes a level and animation editor ; several mods have been made for the game . 
 The game was developed to be able to be controlled by the player with only the mouse , after it was suggested by Yu 's father . The developers felt that this control scheme forced them to make the gameplay fluid and easy to grasp , though they also added the option to control the game with a keyboard or Xbox 360 controller . Yu and Holowka considered the " hallmark " of exploratory games to be a sense of loneliness , which they made a part of the narrative , but also wanted the player to get a sense of Naija 's character . To that end , they used voice @-@ overs to demonstrate to the player what Naija was feeling during key points of the game . The voice of Naija was performed by Jenna Sharpe , who was chosen after auditioning several other voice actresses . She additionally sang the vocals for one song on the soundtrack , " Lost to the Waves " . She also sang a nine @-@ minute vocal piece , " Fear the Dark " , especially for the release of the Aquaria soundtrack album , which was published by Bit Blot on November 14 , 2009 . The album features 50 tracks on two discs , including all of the music in the game as well as the new vocal track and a few remixes . 
 The game was released for Windows computers on December 7 , 2007 . A patch was later released which added new functionality to the in @-@ game map , added widescreen support , and tweaked several game settings . A Macintosh port was released November 12 , 2008 , courtesy of Ambrosia Software . The game was released on Steam on December 15 , 2008 ; it included the addition of 27 Steam Achievements . A Linux version of the game was developed by Ryan C. Gordon in 2009 ; an open beta ran until February 6 , 2010 , and the Linux version of the game was released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle . The source code for the game 's engine was released under the GNU General Public License on June 3 , 2010 . A modified version was released on the iPad on November 2 , 2011 . This version , which includes touchscreen support and changes to the way the map works , was created by Andrew Church , who was approached to do the port by Holowka after he did an unofficial PlayStation Portable source port .

 Aquaria was the Seumas McNally Grand Prize winner of the 2007 Independent Games Festival , and was also a finalist in the categories of Design Innovation , Excellence in Visual Art , and Excellence in Audio . The festival praised the game 's " fluid controls , unique , non @-@ linear gameplay , and vibrant hand @-@ drawn storybook @-@ style graphics " . The game received praise from many different reviewers ; Cam Shea of IGN called it " a stunning effort from such a small team " , Richard Naik of GameCritics called it " an extremely high @-@ quality product " and a fine example of the side @-@ scroller genre , while Chris Dahlen of The A.V. Club termed it " not so much a retro adventure as a fresh take on everything that made the old 2D adventures great " . Praise for the game was centered primarily on its visuals and atmosphere . Hyper 's Tim Henderson commended the game for " a rare and genuine sense of exploration , wonder and discovery " . A review by Scott Colbourne from The Globe and Mail termed Aquaria " drop @-@ dead beautiful " with a " deep and affecting story " and summarized it as " a game you can get comfortably lost in " . 
 Other reviewers , such as Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer and Chris Holt of Macworld echoed the praises for the graphics and atmosphere , while Craig Pearson of PC Gamer UK added praises for the music and voiceovers and Suzie Ochs of MacLife praised the music and story . Other praises for the game came for its control scheme and for the gameplay mechanics , with Holt calling out the cooking system as worthy of praise . Though noting that the visuals and presentation of the game would be the first thing that players noticed , Nathan Cocks of PC PowerPlay claimed that " from a design standpoint , Aquaria is a triumph , " with the right amount of complexity and level design that is " spot on " . 
 Several reviewers , such as Bramwell and Holt , criticized the map system present in the initial version of the game as being confusing and difficult . Other reviewers had different concerns , such as Henderson , who critiqued the initial release version for " lack of widescreen support and being occasionally fiddly " , or Naik , who felt that the control scheme was not as intuitive when using an Xbox 360 controller . Shea and Pearson felt that the game could have used more puzzles or a wider variety of quests and objectives to balance out the exploration and combat . They did not feel , though , that these downsides compared to the game 's positives , with Pearson stating that " the good far outweighs what are , essentially , niggles . " 
 = IWGP Heavyweight Championship ( IGF ) = 
 The IWGP Heavyweight Championship was a professional wrestling heavyweight championship owned by the Inoki Genome Federation ( IGF ) promotion . The title shares its name with New Japan Pro Wrestling 's ( NJPW ) IWGP Heavyweight Championship , from which it split due to a decision made by IGF and NJPW founder Antonio Inoki . " IWGP " is the abbreviation of NJPW 's fictional governing body , the International Wrestling Grand Prix . 
 During the title 's history , IGF recognized it as the official IWGP Heavyweight Championship , continuing the history of the title after an error made by NJPW in Inoki 's eyes . NJPW recognized the title as the IWGP 3rd Belt Championship , a championship that was merely represented by a previous version of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship 's title belt . The title was briefly used in the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) promotion , which recognized it as the IWGP Heavyweight Championship . 
 As a professional wrestling championship , the title was won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline . The inaugural champion was Brock Lesnar , who was the reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion before being stripped of the title due to issues with NJPW . IGF recognized him as the official IWGP Heavyweight Champion afterwards . All title changes occurred at IGF or NJPW @-@ promoted events . There were a total of three reigns among three wrestlers during the title 's brief history before being unified with the IWGP Heavyweight Championship .

 On October 8 , 2005 , at New Japan Pro Wrestling 's ( NJPW ) Toukon <unk> New Chapter event in Tokyo , Japan , Brock Lesnar defeated Kazuyuki Fujita and Masahiro Chono in a Three Way match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship . He held the title for 280 days , having three successful defenses , until he failed to show up for a scheduled title defense . NJPW thus stripped Lesnar of the championship on July 15 , 2006 . Lesnar cited visa issues along with NJPW owing him compensation for his reasons at failing to appear at the planned title defense . After this series of events , NJPW founder Antonio Inoki left NJPW and created a new promotion , the Inoki Genome Federation ( IGF ) . Inoki then recognized Lesnar as the IWGP Heavyweight Champion due to Lesnar never having lost the championship in a match and Lesnar still maintaining physical possession of the title belt . NJPW recognized Lesnar as the IWGP 3rd Belt Champion and not the IWGP Heavyweight Champion , maintaining their stance on having stripped him of the title in 2006 . 
 On June 29 , 2007 , IGF held its debut show with Lesnar defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Kurt Angle in the main event . Angle defeated Lesnar to win the championship at the show with Angle going on to appear in the American Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) promotion with the physical title belt . TNA also referred to the title belt as the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in the same manner as the IGF , recognizing Angle as the official IWGP Heavyweight Champion . NJPW did not recognize Angle as the IWGP Heavyweight Champion , instead it viewed Angle as the second IWGP 3rd Belt Champion . 
 Angle went on to have two successful defenses as champion . His first defense came in TNA in a feud against Samoa Joe . Angle first appeared with the title belt in TNA on the July 5 , 2007 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! . The title belt became relevant to the storyline rivalry between Joe and Angle heading into TNA 's Hard Justice pay @-@ per @-@ view ( PPV ) event . Leading up to TNA 's Victory Road PPV event on July 15 , 2007 , TNA X Division Champion Joe and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Angle teamed together to face TNA World Tag Team Champions Team 3D ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) in a Tag Team match with the stipulation being whoever scored the pinfall or submission for their team won the championship of the person pinned or made to submit . Joe pinned Brother Ray in the bout , thus winning the World Tag Team Championship for himself and a partner of his choosing . Joe chose to hold the title alone and challenged Angle to a Winner Take All match at Hard Justice for the TNA World Heavyweight , TNA X Division , TNA World Tag Team , and the IWGP Heavyweight Championships on the July 19 2007 , episode of Impact ! . Angle accepted the match , with Joe and Angle facing at Hard Justice on August 12 , 2007 in Orlando , Florida for all of the titles . Angle defeated Joe at the event to win the TNA World Tag Team and TNA X Division Championships , while retaining the TNA World Heavyweight and IWGP Heavyweight Championships . Afterwards , TNA slowly faded out using the IWGP Heavyweight Championship with Angle going on to defend the title at IGF and NJPW promoted shows , with the title being referred to as both the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and the IWGP 3rd Belt Championship . 
 Angle 's second defense of the title was at NJPW 's Wrestle Kingdom II in Tokyo Dome event on January 4 , 2008 where he defeated former NJPW recognized IWGP Heavyweight Champion Yuji Nagata to retain the IWGP 3rd Belt Championship . Angle 's last defense was against then NJPW recognized IWGP Heavyweight Champion Shinsuke Nakamura in a unification match on February 17 , 2008 at NJPW 's Circuit 2008 New Japan ISM event where the winner would be the unified IWGP Heavyweight Champion . Angle lost the match , thus ending the existence of the IGF recognized IWGP Heavyweight Championship . IGF later introduced another title five years later with the IGF Championship on December 31 , 2013 .

 = Reasonable Doubt ( album ) = 
 Reasonable Doubt is the debut studio album by American rapper Jay @-@ Z. It was released on June 25 , 1996 , by Roc @-@ A @-@ Fella Records and Priority Records . The album features production provided by DJ Premier , Ski , <unk> and Clark Kent , and also it includes guest appearances from Memphis Bleek , Mary J. Blige and The Notorious B.I.G. , among others . The album features Mafioso rap themes and gritty lyrics about the " hustler " lifestyle and material obsessions . 
 Reasonable Doubt debuted at number 23 on the US Billboard 200 , on which it charted for 18 weeks . It was promoted with four singles ; including " Ain 't No Nigga " and " Can 't Knock the Hustle " . Reasonable Doubt was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and , as of 2006 , has sold 1 @.@ 5 million copies in the United States . A critical success , it has been ranked on several publications ' lists of the greatest rap albums ever , while many hip hop fans have viewed it as Jay @-@ Z 's best work . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1989 , aspiring rapper Jay @-@ Z was recruited by mentor Jaz @-@ O to appear on his song " Hawaiian Sophie " . He appeared on two more Jaz @-@ O songs in the next year , but after Jaz @-@ O was dropped from his record label , Jay @-@ Z dealt drugs to support himself . He continued to pursue a rap career and appeared on two songs from Original Flavor 's 1993 album Beyond Flavor . Jay @-@ Z then caught Big Daddy Kane 's attention and toured with him ; they collaborated on Kane 's 1994 posse cut " Show & Prove " along with Wu @-@ Tang Clan 's Ol ' Dirty Bastard , Wu @-@ Tang affiliate <unk> , Sauce Money , and Scoob Lover . 
 Despite the exposure he received from Kane , Jay @-@ Z was still without a record deal . He began selling tapes from his car with help from friend Damon Dash . The success of his street @-@ level marketing led to a deal with Payday Records , which released his first solo single , " In My Lifetime " and its B @-@ side " I Can 't Get wid Dat " . In an unconventional move , Jay @-@ Z then spurned the record contract he had long sought and left Payday Records to form his own label , Roc @-@ A @-@ Fella Records , with Damon Dash and Kareem " Biggs " Burke . Jay @-@ Z later explained that he thought he could do a better job of marketing his records on his own : 
 [ Payday ] eventually signed me to a deal , but were acting shady the whole time , like they didn 't know how to work a record or something , " says Jay . " The things that they were setting up for me I could have done myself . They had me traveling places to do <unk> , and my product wasn 't even available in the store . We shot one video , but when the time came for me to do the video for the second single , I had to be cut out . They gave me the money and I started my own company . There was a little arguing back and forth , but our conflict finally got resolved . The bottom line was they wasn 't doing their job , so I had to get out of there . 
 Jay @-@ Z rented a small , cheap office for Roc @-@ A @-@ Fella Records on John Street in one of the " dreariest parts of the busiest city in the world " . Jay @-@ Z and his compatriots thought of their low @-@ rent headquarters as a " starting point " that would eventually lead them to Manhattan . In 1995 and early 1996 , Jay @-@ Z appeared on records by Big L and Mic Geronimo , further raising his profile . At this point , he was still considered an " underground " rapper with a " new jack " style . Roc @-@ A @-@ Fella released Reasonable Doubt with Priority Records . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Reasonable Doubt was recorded at D & D Studios and mixed at Platinum Island , however , its beats were formed elsewhere . " Can 't Knock the Hustle " was produced by <unk> at his mother 's home in 1994 , while the vocals were recorded on tour at a studio in Tampa Florida named Progressive Music with Mary J Blige . Ski produced " Feelin ' It " and " Politics as Usual " while recording with Camp Lo . The recording sessions were often competitive ; Ski and Clark Kent created similar beats for " Politics as Usual " , but Ski submitted his to Jay @-@ Z first causing his to appear on the album . " Brooklyn 's Finest " was a competitive , though friendly battle between Jay @-@ Z and The Notorious B.I.G. in which Jay @-@ Z tried proving that he is of Biggie 's caliber , while Biggie tried brushing his rhymes off as insignificant . Although the rappers had already met on the set for the " Dead Presidents " music video , they discovered that neither wrote down their rhymes while recording . The recording of " Brooklyn 's Finest " spanned two months and moved from D & D Studios to Giant Studios where the Clark Kent @-@ sung chorus was recorded . 
 Reasonable Doubt has Mafioso rap themes . David Drake from Stylus Magazine said the lyrics were characterized by " gritty realism " . Dream Hampton believed that although rappers had alluded to hustling before , Jay @-@ Z " talks about what it can do to a person 's inner peace , and what it can do to their mind " . Jay @-@ Z later said , " the studio was like a psychiatrist 's couch for me " while recording Reasonable Doubt . AllMusic 's Steve Huey described him as " a street hustler from the projects who rapped about what he knew — and he was very , very good at it ... detailing his experiences on the streets with disarming honesty " . Huey summarizes the album 's subject matter saying : 
 He 's cocky bordering on arrogant , but playful and witty , and exudes an effortless , unaffected cool throughout . And even if he 's rapping about rising to the top instead of being there , his material obsessions are already apparent [ ... ] the album 's defining cut might [ ... ] be the brief " 22 Two 's , " which not only demonstrates Jay @-@ Z 's extraordinary talent as a pure freestyle rapper , but also preaches a subtle message through its club hostess : Bad behavior gets in the way of making money . Perhaps that 's why Jay @-@ Z waxes reflective , not enthusiastic , about the darker side of the streets . 
 AllMusic 's Jason Birchmeier writes that the album 's production exhibits characteristics of " the pre @-@ gangsta era , a foregone era when samples fueled the beats and turntablism supplied the hooks " , which " sets Reasonable Doubt apart from Jay @-@ Z 's later work " . " Can 't Knock the Hustle " features a smooth beat . " Politics as Usual " has an R & B sound and a sample of " Hurry Up This Way Again " by The Stylistics . " Dead Presidents " samples Nas ' voice from " The World Is Yours " in its chorus . According to IGN 's Spence D. , " Ski brings back the stripped down piano fill style lending the track a late night jazz vibe " on " Feelin ' It " , and " 22 Two 's " has a " mournful jazz inclined groove " that prominently features string instruments . " Coming of Age " contains a Clark Kent @-@ produced beat that samples the melody and drums from " Inside You " by Eddie Henderson .

 Released on June 25 , 1996 , Reasonable Doubt peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200 . It spent 18 weeks on the chart , and 55 weeks on the Billboard Top R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Albums , on which it reached number three . By the end of 1996 , it had sold 420 @,@ 000 copies in the United States . On February 7 , 2002 , Reasonable Doubt was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , for shipments of one million copies in the US . It remains the lowest charting album of Jay @-@ Z 's career . 
 According to Pitchfork Media 's Ryan Schreiber , Reasonable Doubt has often been " considered one of hip @-@ hop 's landmark albums " . while Birchmeier said it was viewed like Nas ' Illmatic ( 1994 ) as a classic hip hop album by a young rapper about their street and criminal experiences . Reasonable Doubt helped transfigure gangsta rap into Mafioso rap , popularizing the subgenre and the imagery of high class , expensive lifestyles and tastes in hip hop , including drinking Cristal , driving Lexus automobiles , and living out the plots of films such as Scarface and Carlito 's Way . In the opinion of Miles Marshall Lewis , Reasonable Doubt was a " seminal " work that " shocked the world ... a personal touchstone for fans then Jay 's own age who were getting their own hustles on — hip hop 's young , gifted , and black " . Jay @-@ Z said that recreating Reasonable Doubt would be challenging , as he was living a different lifestyle with a completely different state of mind when he wrote the album . 
 Reasonable Doubt has often been considered by many fans to be Jay @-@ Z 's best record . He himself deemed it his best . According to Birchmeier , it differed from his subsequent albums by lacking " pop @-@ crossover " songs and hits . Shaheem Reid of MTV explained , " Reasonable Doubt might not have the radio hits or club bangers of many of his other albums , but it may be Jay at his most lyrical — and certainly at his most honest , according to him " . Huey said the lyrical appeal lied within Jay @-@ Z 's " effortless , unaffected cool " flow , " disarming honesty " , and knack for " writing some of the most acrobatic rhymes heard in quite some time " . According to Huey , this " helped Reasonable Doubt rank as one of the finest albums of New York 's hip @-@ hop renaissance of the ' 90s " . Birchmeier , on the other hand , believed the superior quality of producers was more responsible for the album 's reputation as a classic more so than Jay @-@ Z. In a retrospective review for MSN Music , Robert Christgau said the album was " designed for the hip @-@ hop cognoscenti and street aesthetes who still swear he never topped it , " finding it " richer than any outsider could have known , and benefiting from everything we 've since learned about the minor crack baron who put his money where his mouth was . You can hear him marshalling a discipline known to few rappers and many crack barons , and that asceticism undercuts the intrinsic delight of his rhymes " . 
 Reasonable Doubt was named one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time by The Source in 1998 , Vibe , who ranked it seventh on their 2002 list , MTV.com , who ranked it sixth on their 2005 list , and About.com 's Henry Adaso ; Adaso ranked it as the 14th greatest hip hop album , the second best rap record of 1996 , and the fifth most " essential " hip hop album ever . Blender included Reasonable Doubt on the magazine 's 2003 list of " 500 CDs You Must Own Before You Die " . That same year , Rolling Stone ranked it number 248 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . The magazine also named it the 17th best album of the 1990s . It was included in Vibe 's " 51 Albums Representing a Generation , a Sound and a Movement " ( 2004 ) , and Hip Hop Connection 's " The 100 Greatest Rap Albums 1995 @-@ 2005 " . 
 In 2006 , Jay @-@ Z performed the songs from Reasonable Doubt at the Radio City Music Hall to celebrate its tenth anniversary . The concert 's band included The Roots ' drummer Questlove , the <unk> , a 50 @-@ piece orchestra dubbed The <unk> 's Symphony and Just Blaze , the performance 's disc jockey . On " Can 't Knock the Hustle " , Beyoncé Knowles replaced Mary J. Blige , who was preparing for her Breakthrough Tour at the time . Jay @-@ Z rapped The Notorious B.I.G. ' s verses on " Brooklyn 's Finest " , and Jaz @-@ O 's verse was left out of " Bring It On " . Jay @-@ Z added a verse to " 22 Two 's " in which he says variations of the words " for / four " 44 times over the beat of " Can I Kick It ? " by A Tribe Called Quest . Other alterations include Jay @-@ Z changing a lyrical mention of Cristal to Dom Pérignon and Jay @-@ Z 's band " <unk> [ ing ] up tracks like ' Regrets ' to add more energy " . Celebrities such as Alicia Keys , Young Jeezy , Jadakiss , Chris Tucker , LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony attended the concert . 3 @,@ 000 tickets were put on sale ; all were sold within two minutes according to Roc @-@ A @-@ Fella Records ' website .

 = Os ( Fringe ) = 
 " Os " is the 16th episode of the third season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe , and the 59th episode overall . The episode centered on the Fringe team 's investigation into a series of robberies of the element osmium , which they connect to a scientist ( Alan Ruck ) who is able to defy the laws of physics . 
 " Os " was written by Josh Singer and Graham Roland , while Brad Anderson served as director . Along with Ruck , the episode also guest starred Jorge Garcia in a brief cameo as a security guard . 
 On its first broadcast in the United States on March 11 , 2011 , an estimated 3 @.@ 76 million viewers tuned in , giving it a 1 @.@ 5 / 5 ratings share for those between the ages 18 – 49 . Critical reception to the episode was generally positive , as multiple critics noted that Ruck was well @-@ cast as a scientist just trying to help his son . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Fringe team is called to the scene of a robbery of a metal depository ; the body of one of the thieves , shot by a security guard , inexplicably floats off the ground , while a second culprit has gotten away . They find that the thief has taken off with a supply of osmium , one of the densest elements , and an autopsy later reveals that the dead thief 's body is filled with the metal . Tracking a security card on the body , they enter a warehouse where they find the second culprit , dead , along with the bodies of several more people , all of them paraplegic . Walter ( John Noble ) notes that the physical properties of osmium ( both gravitational and thermal ) have been reversed , and by melting the osmium collected from the first victim using liquid nitrogen , they detect the presence of the rarer element lutetium , typically only present in meteorites . 
 Recognizing that the local science museum has a display of meteorites , the Fringe team is able to secure Dr. Crick ( Alan Ruck ) , the man behind the osmium injections , and another paraplegic who has taken Dr. Crick 's injections as they attempt to steal the display . With Dr. Crick in custody , Walter learns that the man had worked in aerospace to find an alloy for fighter craft . He happened upon the combination of the osmium @-@ lutetium alloy that generated a material lighter than air , and sought to refine a permanent solution to give his own paraplegic son the ability to walk , having promised the same to those that had died from earlier , lethal doses of the alloy . 
 Walter , who has lamented to Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ) his need to have William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) back to make himself whole , realizes that the only reason the osmium @-@ lutetium alloy became lighter than air was due to his own transgression into the parallel universe that has started to break down the laws of reality . To reverse those effects , Walter intends to use the idea of " soul magnets " , microscopic devices that can be ingested by a person to call forth the soul of another . Walter believes Bell had arranged for someone in the prime universe to be his vessel , and rings the bell that Bell had bequeathed to Nina , believing it to be the instrument that will activate the soul magnets and call forth Bell . 
 Simultaneously , Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) has decided to open up to Olivia ( Anna Torv ) and shows her the five data discs from the shapeshifters he killed after the doomsday device weaponized him . As he discusses it with her , Olivia hears the sound of the bell . She turns to face Peter , revealing herself to now be possessed by Bell . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode was co @-@ written by co @-@ executive producer Josh Singer and executive story editor Graham Roland , while former Fringe producer Brad Anderson directed it . 
 The return of the William Bell character to the series was inspired by Leonard Nimoy from earlier seasons . In his first appearance on Fringe in the first season finale , " There 's More Than One of Everything " , Nimoy requested that a bell be placed on his desk so that his character would be able to ring it as a play on the character 's name . When the writers considered how to bring Bell back for the third season , they recalled this mannerism , and wrote it into the larger mythos , being the means by which Bell 's mind emerged from Olivia 's at the end of this episode . 
 On March 3 , Entertainment Weekly reported that actor Jorge Garcia would be making a cameo appearance in an upcoming Fringe episode . Garcia , who previously starred as Hugo " Hurley " Reyes from J.J. Abrams ' Lost , appears as a Massive Dynamic guard that is smoking a bong with Walter at the start of the episode . Alan Ruck guests as Dr. Crick , the person behind the floating bodies . Ruck was approached by the show 's producers having envisioned him for the role . Ruck described the character , " He is no dummy ... and he stumbled on to something and he is trying to figure out a way to use it . Ultimately he would like to use it for good , but in so doing he causes a lot of damage . So I guess you can say he 's obsessed . And this particular point in time where the episode of Fringe starts , time is fleeting and he 's just ... under the gun . " On his character 's possible reappearance , Ruck commented , " I think not ... Technically yes [ he could come back ] , but probably not . " 
 As with other Fringe episodes , Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children , focusing on the science seen in " Os " , with the intention of having " students learn about meteorites and ways of finding them . "

 Reviews of the episode were generally positive . Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly praised guest actor Alan Ruck 's " sustained , understated " performance , and also called Olivia being revealed as Bell 's vessel " a clever development , " especially praising actress Anna Torv 's imitation of Nimoy 's voice rather than " doing the obvious thing and hav [ ing ] her lip @-@ synch Nimoy reading the lines . " A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B- , explaining that unlike Tucker , he thought the idea of " soul magnets " was " just so goofy that it 's almost too much for me to handle " . VanDerWerff also felt there wasn 't much of a connection between the episode and the ongoing storyline " until the show tries to force one in a way that doesn 't feel as elegant as the show usually makes this stuff feel " . He did however praise Ruck as " well @-@ cast , " and wrote the episode " very nearly managed " to parallel Walter 's " desperate measures to the desperate measures of other men also trying to save themselves or their children through science , " which the reviewer considers the strongest asset of the show . 
 Writing for the Los Angeles Times , critic Andrew Hanson referred to audiences ' Friday night plans away from television when he commented the episode was " better than any movie you 're going to see in the theater right now " . Hanson thought the mystery produced " surprises around every corner " . IGN 's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8 @.@ 0 / 10 , explaining he enjoyed the " classic Fringe " opening scene , the " decent [ acting ] job " by Ruck , and John Noble 's performance ; he also thought the script was " very clever [ as ] it reveals surprising story elements with innovative tricks " . Isler wasn 't sure what to make of the Bell @-@ Olivia plot twist however , commenting that " this new William Bell thing is either going to end up as the best plot device of the season , or the cheesiest thing in recent sci @-@ fi history " . 
 Billy Grifter from Den of Geek was slightly disappointed with the " mad scientist " storyline as he felt it had been done before , but found several redeeming qualities : Alan Ruck 's performance and the last five minutes featuring Noble and Blair Brown , and Torv with Joshua Jackson . Grifter thought the Noble @-@ Brown scene was " actually very funny , " praising the two actors ' performances , and added that this humor made the following Torv @-@ Jackson scene 's impact " even greater " . Referring to Torv 's " passable " Nimoy impression , Grifter concluded that " the strength of Fringe is that it can take a rather light and fluffy premise , like the one in " Os " , and embellish it with wonderful character moments and a genuine surprise or two " . 
 = James Whitcomb Riley = 
 James Whitcomb Riley ( October 7 , 1849 – July 22 , 1916 ) was an American writer , poet , and best @-@ selling author . During his lifetime he was known as the " Hoosier Poet " and " Children 's Poet " for his dialect works and his children 's poetry respectively . His poems tended to be humorous or sentimental , and of the approximately one thousand poems that Riley authored , the majority are in dialect . His famous works include " Little Orphant Annie " and " The Raggedy Man " . 
 Riley began his career writing verses as a sign maker and submitting poetry to newspapers . Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s . Riley gradually rose in prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours . He traveled a touring circuit first in the Midwest , and then nationally , holding shows and making joint appearances on stage with other famous talents . Regularly struggling with his alcohol addiction , Riley never married or had children , and created a scandal in 1888 when he became too drunk to perform . He became more popular in spite of the bad press he received , and as a result extricated himself from poorly negotiated contracts that limited his earnings ; he quickly became very wealthy . 
 Riley became a bestselling author in the 1890s . His children 's poems were compiled into a book and illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy . Titled the Rhymes of Childhood , the book was his most popular and sold millions of copies . As a poet , Riley achieved an uncommon level of fame during his own lifetime . He was honored with annual Riley Day celebrations around the United States and was regularly called on to perform readings at national civic events . He continued to write and hold occasional poetry readings until a stroke paralyzed his right arm in 1910 . 
 Riley 's chief legacy was his influence in fostering the creation of a midwestern cultural identity and his contributions to the Golden Age of Indiana Literature . Along with other writers of his era , he helped create a caricature of midwesterners and formed a literary community that produced works rivaling the established eastern literati . There are many memorials dedicated to Riley , including the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children .

 = = = Family and background = = = 
 James Whitcomb Riley was born on October 7 , 1849 , in the town of Greenfield , Indiana , the third of the six children of Reuben Andrew and Elizabeth Marine Riley . Riley 's father was an attorney , and in the year before Riley 's birth , he was elected a member of the Indiana House of Representatives as a Democrat . He developed a friendship with James Whitcomb , the governor of Indiana , after whom he named his son . Martin Riley , Riley 's uncle , was an amateur poet who occasionally wrote verses for local newspapers . Riley was fond of his uncle who helped influence his early interest in poetry . 
 Shortly after Riley 's birth , the family moved into a larger house in town . Riley was " a quiet boy , not talkative , who would often go about with one eye shut as he observed and speculated . " His mother taught him to read and write at home before sending him to the local community school in 1852 . He found school difficult and was frequently in trouble . Often punished , he had nothing kind to say of his teachers in his writings . His poem " The Educator " told of an intelligent but sinister teacher and may have been based on one of his instructors . Riley was most fond of his last teacher , Lee O. Harris . Harris noticed Riley 's interest in poetry and reading and encouraged him to pursue it further . 
 Riley 's school attendance was sporadic , and he graduated from grade eight at age twenty in 1869 . In an 1892 newspaper article , Riley confessed that he knew little of mathematics , geography , or science , and his understanding of proper grammar was poor . Later critics , like Henry Beers , pointed to his poor education as the reason for his success in writing ; his prose was written in the language of common people which spurred his popularity . 
 = = = Childhood influences = = = 
 Riley lived in his parents ' home until he was twenty @-@ one years old . At five years old he began spending time at the Brandywine Creek just outside Greenfield . His poems " The Barefoot Boy " and " The Old Swimmin ' Hole " referred back to his time at the creek . He was introduced in his childhood to many people who later influenced his poetry . His father regularly brought home a variety of clients and disadvantaged people to give them assistance . Riley 's poem " The Raggedy Man " was based on a German tramp his father hired to work at the family home . Riley picked up the cadence and character of the dialect of central Indiana from travelers along the old National Road . Their speech greatly influenced the hundreds of poems he wrote in nineteenth century Hoosier dialect . 
 Riley 's mother frequently told him stories of fairies , trolls , and giants , and read him children 's poems . She was very superstitious , and influenced Riley with many of her beliefs . They both placed " spirit rappings " in their homes on places like tables and bureaus to capture any spirits that may have been wandering about . This influence is recognized in many of his works , including " Flying Islands of the Night . " 
 As was common at that time , Riley and his friends had few toys and they amused themselves with activities . With his mother 's aid , Riley began creating plays and theatricals which he and his friends would practice and perform in the back of a local grocery store . As he grew older , the boys named their troupe the Adelphians and began to have their shows in barns where they could fit larger audiences . Riley wrote of these early performances in his poem " When We First Played ' Show ' , " where he referred to himself as " <unk> . " 
 Many of Riley 's poems are filled with musical references . Riley had no musical education , and could not read sheet music , but learned from his father how to play guitar , and from a friend how to play violin . He performed in two different local bands , and became so proficient on the violin he was invited to play with a group of adult Freemasons at several events . A few of his later poems were set to music and song , one of the most well known being A Short 'nin ' Bread Song — Pieced Out . 
 When Riley was ten years old , the first library opened in his hometown . From an early age he developed a love of literature . He and his friends spent time at the library where the librarian read stories and poems to them . Charles Dickens became one Riley 's favorites , and helped inspire the poems " St. <unk> , " " Christmas Season , " and " God Bless Us Every One . " 
 Riley 's father enlisted in the Union Army during the American Civil War , leaving his wife to manage the family home . While he was away , the family took in a twelve @-@ year @-@ old orphan named Mary Alice " Allie " Smith . Smith was the inspiration for Riley 's poem " Little Orphant Annie " . Riley intended to name the poem " Little Orphant Allie " , but a typesetter 's error changed the name of the poem during printing . 
 = = = Finding poetry = = = 
 Riley 's father returned from the war partially paralyzed . He was unable to continue working in his legal practice and the family soon fell into financial distress . The war had a negative physiological effect on him , and his relationship with his family quickly deteriorated . He opposed Riley 's interest in poetry and encouraged him to find a different career . The family finances finally disintegrated and they were forced to sell their town home in April 1870 and return to their country farm . Riley 's mother was able to keep peace in the family , but after her death in August from heart disease , Riley and his father had a final break . He blamed his mother 's death on his father 's failure to care for her in her final weeks . He continued to regret the loss of his childhood home and wrote frequently of how it was so cruelly snatched from him by the war , subsequent poverty , and his mother 's death . After the events of 1870 , he developed an addiction to alcohol which he struggled with for the remainder of his life . 
 Becoming increasingly belligerent toward his father , Riley moved out of the family home and briefly had a job painting houses before leaving Greenfield in November 1870 . He was recruited as a Bible salesman and began working in the nearby town of Rushville , Indiana . The job provided little income and he returned to Greenfield in March 1871 where he started an apprenticeship to a painter . He completed the study and opened a business in Greenfield creating and maintaining signs . His earliest known poems are verses he wrote as clever advertisements for his customers . 
 Riley began participating in local theater productions with the Adelphians to earn extra income , and during the winter months , when the demand for painting declined , Riley began writing poetry which he mailed to his brother living in Indianapolis . His brother acted as his agent and offered the poems to the newspaper Indianapolis Mirror for free . His first poem was featured on March 30 , 1872 under the pseudonym " Jay Whit . " Riley wrote more than twenty poems to the newspaper , including one that was featured on the front page . 
 In July 1872 , after becoming convinced sales would provide more income than sign painting , he joined the <unk> Company based in Anderson , Indiana . The company sold patent medicines that they marketed in small traveling shows around Indiana . Riley joined the act as a huckster , calling himself the " Painter Poet " . He traveled with the act , composing poetry and performing at the shows . After his act he sold tonics to his audience , sometimes employing dishonesty . During one stop , Riley presented himself as a formerly blind painter who had been cured by a tonic , using himself as evidence to encourage the audience to purchase his product . 
 Riley began sending poems to his brother again in February 1873 . About the same time he and several friends began an advertisement company . The men traveled around Indiana creating large billboard @-@ like signs on the sides of buildings and barns and in high places that would be visible from a distance . The company was financially successful , but Riley was continually drawn to poetry . In October he traveled to South Bend where he took a job at Stockford & <unk> painting verses on signs for a month ; the short duration of his job may have been due to his frequent drunkenness at that time . 
 In early 1874 , Riley returned to Greenfield to become a writer full @-@ time . In February he submitted a poem entitled " At Last " to the Danbury News , a Connecticut newspaper . The editors accepted his poem , paid him for it , and wrote him a letter encouraging him to submit more . Riley found the note and his first payment inspiring . He began submitting poems regularly to the editors , but after the newspaper shut down in 1875 , Riley was left without a paying publisher . He began traveling and performing with the Adelphians around central Indiana to earn an income while he searched for a new publisher . In August 1875 he joined another traveling tonic show run by the Wizard Oil Company .

 Riley began sending correspondence to the famous American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow during late 1875 seeking his endorsement to help him start a career as a poet . He submitted many poems to Longfellow , whom he considered to be the greatest living poet . Not receiving a prompt response , he sent similar letters to John Townsend Trowbridge , and several other prominent writers <unk> for an endorsement . Longfellow finally replied in a brief letter , telling Riley that " I have read [ the poems ] in great pleasure , and think they show a true poetic faculty and insight . " Riley carried the letter with him everywhere and , hoping to receive a job offer and to create a market for his poetry , he began sending poems to dozens of newspapers touting Longfellow 's endorsement . Among the newspapers to take an interest in the poems was the Indianapolis Journal , a major Republican Party metropolitan newspaper in Indiana . Among the first poems the newspaper purchased from Riley were " Song of the New Year " , " An Empty Nest " , and a short story entitled " A Remarkable Man " . 
 The editors of the Anderson Democrat discovered Riley 's poems in the Indianapolis Journal and offered him a job as a reporter in February 1877 . Riley accepted . He worked as a normal reporter gathering local news , writing articles , and assisting in setting the typecast on the printing press . He continued to write poems regularly for the newspaper and to sell other poems to larger newspapers . During the year Riley spent working in Anderson , he met and began to court <unk> <unk> . The couple became engaged , but terminated the relationship after they decided against marriage in August . 
 After a rejection of his poems by an eastern periodical , Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality and that it was being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east . Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem . The Dispatch published the poem and reported it as such . Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago , Boston , and New York to gauge their reaction ; they were disappointed . While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic , the majority did not , claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe . An employee of the Dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune , which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax . The revelation damaged the credibility of the Dispatch and harmed Riley 's reputation . 
 In the aftermath of the Poe plot , Riley was dismissed from the Democrat , so he returned to Greenfield to spend time writing poetry . Back home , he met Clara Louise Bottsford , a school teacher boarding in his father 's home . They found they had much in common , particularly their love of literature . The couple began a twelve @-@ year intermittent relationship which would be Riley 's longest lasting . In mid @-@ 1878 the couple had their first breakup , caused partly by Riley 's alcohol addiction . The event led Riley to make his first attempt to give up liquor . He joined a local temperance organization , but quit after a few weeks .

 Without a steady income , his financial situation began to deteriorate . He began submitting his poems to more prominent literary magazines , including Scribner 's Monthly , but was informed that although he showed promise , his work was still short of the standards required for use in their publications . Locally , he was still dealing with the stigma of the Poe plot . The Indianapolis Journal and other newspapers refused to accept his poetry , leaving Riley desperate for income . In January 1878 on the advice of a friend , Riley paid an entrance fee to join a traveling lecture circuit where he could give poetry readings . In exchange , he received a portion of the profit his performances earned . Such circuits were popular at the time , and Riley quickly earned a local reputation for his entertaining readings . 
 In August 1878 , Riley followed Indiana Governor James D. Williams as speaker at a civic event in a small town near Indianapolis . He recited a recently composed poem , " A Childhood Home of Long Ago , " telling of life in pioneer Indiana . The poem was well received and was given good reviews by several newspapers . 
 " Flying Islands of the Night " is the only play that Riley wrote and published . Authored while Riley was traveling with the Adelphians , but never performed , the play has similarities to A Midsummer Night 's Dream , which Riley may have used as a model . Flying Islands concerns a kingdom besieged by evil forces of a sinister queen who is defeated eventually by an angel @-@ like heroine . Most reviews were positive . Riley published the play and it became popular in the central Indiana area during late 1878 , helping Riley to convince newspapers to again accept his poetry . In November 1879 he was offered a position as a columnist at the Indianapolis Journal and accepted after being encouraged by E.B. <unk> , the paper 's chief editor . 
 Although the play and his newspaper work helped expose him to a wider audience , the chief source of his increasing popularity was his performances on the lecture circuit . He made both dramatic and comedic readings of his poetry , and by early 1879 could guarantee large crowds whenever he performed . In an 1894 article , Hamlin Garland wrote that Riley 's celebrity resulted from his reading talent , saying " his vibrant individual voice , his flexible lips , his droll glance , united to make him at once poet and comedian — comedian in the sense in which makes for tears as well as for laughter . " Although he was a good performer , his acts were not entirely original in style ; he frequently copied practices developed by Samuel Clemens and Will Carleton . His tour in 1880 took him to every city in Indiana where he was introduced by local dignitaries and other popular figures , including Maurice Thompson with whom he began to develop a close friendship . 
 Developing and maintaining his publicity became a constant job , and received more of his attention as his fame grew . Keeping his alcohol addiction secret , maintaining the persona of a simple rural poet and a friendly common person became most important . Riley identified these traits as the basis of his popularity during the mid @-@ 1880s , and wrote of his need to maintain a fictional persona . He encouraged the stereotype by authoring poetry he thought would help build his identity . He was aided by editorials he authored and submitted to the Indianapolis Journal offering observations on events from his perspective as a " humble rural poet " . He changed his appearance to look more mainstream , and began by shaving his mustache off and abandoning the flamboyant dress he employed in his early circuit tours . 
 By 1880 his poems were beginning to be published nationally and were receiving positive reviews . " Tom Johnson 's Quit " was carried by newspapers in twenty states , thanks in part to the careful cultivation of his popularity . Riley became frustrated that despite his growing acclaim , he found it difficult to achieve financial success . In the early 1880s , in addition to his steady performing , Riley began producing many poems to increase his income . Half of his poems were written during the period . The constant labor had adverse effects on his health , which was worsened by his drinking . At the urging of Maurice Thompson , he again attempted to stop drinking liquor , but was only able to give it up for a few months .

 = = = Newspaper poet = = = 
 Riley moved to Indianapolis at the end of 1879 to begin his employment with the Journal . It was the only metropolitan newspaper in Indianapolis with daily editions , and had wide readership . For the newspaper he wrote a regular society column that often included verses of poetry . Thereafter Riley met many prominent people , and began a close friendship with Eugene V. Debs . Debs enjoyed Riley 's works and often complimented his sentiments . Riley had been using the pseudonym " Jay Whit " since he started authoring poetry , but finally began to write under his own name in April 1881 . 
 Riley renewed his relationship with Bottsford in 1880 , and the two corresponded frequently . Their relationship remained unstable , but Riley became deeply attached to her . She inspired his poem " The <unk> , " which told of a perfect wife who could suddenly become a demonic monster . Bottsford pressed Riley for marriage several times , but Riley refused . They broke off their relationship a second time in 1881 when she discovered his correspondence with two other women , and found that he had taken a secret vacation to Wisconsin with one of them . 
 Riley 's alcohol addiction influenced some of his poems during his time working for the Journal , including " On Quitting California , " " John <unk> 's Third <unk> , " [ sic ] and " The Dismal Fate of Tit . " Each made references to the delirium caused by drinking . Although Riley rarely published anything controversial , some of his poems published from the same period , including " <unk> " , allude to drug usage and make vague sexual references . During the early 1880s , Riley still made submissions to the elite literary periodicals , but continued to be rejected . Riley found the rejection discouraging , but persevered . He believed he would never be recognized as a true literary figure until one of the prestigious periodicals published his work . 
 = = = Lyceum circuit = = = 
 Riley made occasional reading tours around Indiana , and in August 1880 was invited to perform at Asbury University . His performance there so impressed the local Phi Kappa Psi chapter , he was invited to join as an honorary member . Through the fraternity he met Robert Jones Burdette , a writer and minister in the Indianapolis area . Burdette was a member of the Redpath Lyceum Bureau of Boston , a prominent lecture circuit whose regular speakers included Ralph Waldo Emerson . Burdette encouraged Riley to join the circuit through its Chicago branch . Riley 's accumulated debt and low income began causing him trouble in 1881 , and he decided rejoining a lecture circuit would provide much needed funds . His agreement for continued employment with the circuit depended on his ability to draw audiences during the first season , beginning in April 1881 . He succeeded , drawing the largest crowds in Chicago and Indianapolis . 
 Because of his success in the midwest , the circuit leaders invited him to make an east coast tour , starting in Boston at the Tremont Temple in February 1882 . Riley agreed , signing a ten @-@ year agreement and granting half his receipts to his agent . Before his performance , he traveled to Longfellow 's home in Massachusetts and convinced him to agree to a meeting . Their brief meeting was one of Riley 's fondest memories , and he wrote a lengthy article on it after Longfellow 's death only a month later . Longfellow encouraged Riley to focus on poetry , and gave him advice for his upcoming performance . At the performance , Riley was well received and his poems were greeted with laughter and given praise in the city 's newspaper reviews . Boston was the literary center of the United States at the time , and Riley 's impression on the city 's literary community helped him finally to get his work accepted by prestigious periodicals . The Century Magazine was the first such periodical to accept his work , running " In Swimming @-@ Time " in its September 1883 issue . Until the 1890s , it remained the only major literary magazine to publish Riley 's work . Knowing the high standards of the magazine , Riley reserved his best work each year to submit , including one of his favorites , " The Old Man and Jim " in 1887 . 
 By the end of 1882 , Riley 's finances began to improve dramatically , thanks largely to the income from his performances . During 1883 he began writing his " Boone County " poems by the pseudonym " Benjamin F. Johnson of Boone . " The poems were almost entirely written in dialect and emphasized topics of rural life during the early nineteenth century , often employing nostalgia and the simplicity of country life as elements . " The Old Swimmin ' -Hole " and " When the Frost Is on the Punkin ' " were the most popular , and helped earn the entire series critical acclaim . The topics were popular with readers , reminding many of them of their childhood . Merrill , Meigs & Company ( later renamed Bobbs @-@ Merrill Company ) approached Riley to compile the poems into a book . Riley agreed and printing of his first book began in August 1883 , titled " The Old Swimmin ' -Hole and ' Leven More Poems " . The book 's popularity necessitated a second printing before the end of the year . During this period Riley determined that his most popular poems were those on topics of rural life , and he began to use that as a common theme throughout his future work . 
 The income from Riley 's book allowed him to ease his busy work schedule ; he submitted articles to the Journal less frequently and made fewer lecture stops . His poems became fewer but the quality of his poetry improved ; he wrote his most famous poems during the mid @-@ 1880s , including " Little Orphant Annie " [ sic ] . Riley attempted to secure a new job at a periodical and leave the Journal , but the magazines to which he submitted would not hire him unless he was willing to relocate . Riley was steadfast in his refusal to leave Indiana , and told reporters that his rural home was his inspiration and to leave would ruin his poetry . 
 Riley renewed his relationship with Bottsworth for a third and final time in 1883 . The two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers ' rendezvous . He stopped visiting other women and their relationship became more dedicated and stable . Bottsworth , however , became convinced Riley was seeing another woman , and they terminated their relationship in January 1885 . Riley 's sister , Mary , had become a close friend of Bottsworth and scolded him for his mistreatment of her . Her reputation was tarnished by the affair and she found it difficult to find employment once their relationship ended . 
 In 1884 , Riley made another tour of the major cities in the eastern United States . Following the lectures , he began compiling a second book of poetry . He completed it during July and Bowen @-@ Merrill published it in December with the title The Boss Girl , A Christmas Story and Other Sketches . The book , which contained humorous poetry and short stories , received mixed reviews . It was popular around Indiana , where the majority of its copies were sold . One reviewer , however , called the poems " weird , nightmarish , and eerie , " and compared them to Edgar Allan Poe 's works . 
 While Riley was working on his book , he was unexpectedly invited by James B. Pond , the agent for many of the nations major performers , to join a one @-@ hundred nights ' engagement in New York City in a show that included Samuel Clemens and Dudley Warner . Riley , however , was unable to agree with the Redpath Bureau who had to authorize any other performance under the terms of their contract . Riley believed his contract with Redpath Bureau was limiting his opportunities , and his relationship with his agent became strained . 
 = = = Western Association of Writers = = = 
 Due partly to the limited success of his latest book outside Indiana , Riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to attempt to form an association to promote their work . Popular Indiana writer Lew Wallace , author of Ben @-@ Hur , was a major promoter of the effort . During 1885 , more than one hundred writers joined the group . They held their first meeting in July , naming themselves the Western Association of Writers . At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president , and Riley vice president . The association never succeeded in its goals of creating a powerful advertising force , but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment . Riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group , but came to depend on its regular meetings as a escape from his normally hectic schedule . 
 Through the association , Riley became acquainted with most of the notable writers in the midwestern United States , including humorist Edgar Wilson Nye of Chicago . After completing his lecture circuit in 1885 , Riley formed a partnership with Nye and his agent to begin a new tour . The Redpath Bureau agreed to allow Riley to tour with Nye , provided he maintained his financial agreements with them . In addition to touring , Riley and Nye collaborated to write a book , Nye and Riley 's Railway Guide , a collection of humorous anecdotes and poems intended to parody popular tourist literature of the day . Published in 1888 , the book was somewhat successful and had three reprints . 
 In October 1887 , Riley and the association joined with other writers to petition the United States Congress to attempt to negotiate international treaties to protect American copyrights abroad . The group became known as the International Copyright League and had significant success in its efforts . When traveling to one of the league 's meetings in New York City that year , Riley was struck by Bell 's palsy . He recovered after three weeks , but remained secluded to hide the effects of the sickness which he believed was caused by his alcohol addiction . He made another attempt to stop drinking alcohol with the help of a minister , but again soon returned to his old habit . 
 After recovering , Riley remained briefly in New York to participate in a show at Chickering Hall with Edgar Nye , Samuel Clemens , and several others . Riley was introduced by James Russell Lowell before his performance , and Lowell gave Riley a glowing endorsement to the crowd . Riley 's poetry brought both tears and laughter according to The New York Sun . Critic Edmund Clarence Stedman , one of the foremost literary critics of the era , was present and wrote that Riley 's dialect poems were the finest he had ever heard , " in which a homely dramatis [ sic ] persona 's heart is laid open by subtle indirect , absolutely sure and tender " poetry . As a result of his New York performance , his name and picture were carried in all the major eastern papers and he quickly became well known throughout the United States . Sales of The Boss Girl increased , resulting in the fifth and largest printing , and Riley finally began to achieve the widespread fame he sought . 
 Clemens disliked being upstaged by Riley , and thereafter attempted to avoid any future joint performances with him . According to one review , Clemens " shriveled up into a bitter patch of melancholy in the fierce light of Mr. Riley 's humour . " 
 After returning home from his tour in early 1888 , Riley finished compiling his third book , titled Old @-@ Fashioned Roses . Arranged to appeal to British readers , it included only a few of his dialect poems and consisted mostly of sonnets . The book reprinted many poems Riley had already published , but included some new ones he wrote specifically for the book , including " The Days Gone By , " " The Little White Hearse , " and " The Serenade . " The book was Riley 's favorite because it included his finest works and was published by the prestigious Longmans , Green Publishers in a high quality binding and print . 
 In late 1888 he finished work on a fourth book , Pipes o ' Pan at <unk> which was released to great acclaim in the United States . Based on a fictional town in Indiana , Riley presented many stories and poems about its citizens and way of life . It received mixed reviews among literary critics who wrote of it that Riley 's stories were not of the same quality as his poetry . The book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints . 
 Riley was quickly becoming wealthy from his books and touring , earning nearly $ 20 @,@ 000 in 1888 . He no longer needed his job at the journal , and he left the job near the end of that year . The newspaper had served to earn him fame and had published hundreds of his articles , stories , and poems .

 = = = Politics = = = 
 In March 1888 , Riley traveled to Washington , D.C. where he had dinner at the White House with other members of the International Copyright League and President of the United States Grover Cleveland . Riley made a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections . Cleveland was enamored by Riley 's performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics . In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign , Riley 's acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate . Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life , he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund @-@ raising events and vote stumping . The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana , and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful ; he vowed never to become involved with politics again . 
 Upon Harrison 's election , he suggested Riley be named the national poet laureate , but Congress failed to act on the request . Riley was still honored by Harrison and visited him at the White House on several occasions to perform at civic events . 
 = = = Pay problems and scandal = = = 
 Riley and Nye made arrangements with James Pond to make two national tours during 1888 and 1889 . The tours were popular and generally sold out , with hundreds having to be turned away . The shows were usually forty @-@ five minutes to an hour long and featured Riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from Nye . The shows were informal and the two men adjusted their performances based on their audiences reactions . Riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility . Many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows . At a New York City show in March 1888 , Augustin Daly was so enthralled by the show he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading Broadway theatre actors . 
 Despite Riley serving as the act 's main draw , he was not permitted to become an equal partner in the venture . Nye and Pond both received a percentage of the net profit , while Riley was paid a flat rate for each performance . In addition , because of Riley 's past agreements with the Redpath Lyceum Bureau , he was required to pay half of his fee to his agent Amos Walker . This caused the other men to profit more than Riley from his own work . 
 To remedy this situation , Riley hired his brother @-@ in @-@ law Henry Eitel , an Indianapolis banker , to manage his finances and act on his behalf to try and extricate him from his contract . Despite discussions and assurances from Pond that he would work to address the problem , Eitel had no success . Pond ultimately made the situation worse by booking months of solid performances , not allowing Riley and Nye a day of rest . These events affected Riley physically and emotionally ; he became despondent and began his worst period of alcoholism . During November 1889 , the tour was forced to cancel several shows after Riley became severely inebriated at a stop in Madison , Wisconsin . 
 Walker began monitoring Riley and denying him access to liquor , but Riley found ways to evade Walker . At a stop at the Masonic Temple Theatre in Louisville , Kentucky , in January 1890 , Riley paid the hotel 's bartender to sneak whiskey to his room . He became too drunk to perform , and was unable to travel to the next stop . Nye terminated the partnership and tour in response . The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret , and hotel staff reported to the Louisville Courier @-@ Journal that they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel . The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined . 
 He secretly left Louisville at night and returned to Indianapolis by train . Eitel defended Riley to the press in an effort to gain sympathy for Riley , explaining the abusive financial arrangements his partners had made . Riley however refused to speak to reporters and hid himself for weeks . Much to Riley 's surprise , the news reports made him more popular than ever . Many people thought the stories were exaggerated , and Riley 's carefully cultivated image made it difficult for the public to believe he was an alcoholic . Riley had stopped sending poetry to newspapers and magazines in the aftermath , but they soon began corresponding with him requesting that he resume writing . This encouraged Riley , and he made another attempt to give up liquor as he returned to his public career . 
 The negative press did not end however , as Nye and Pond threatened to sue Riley for causing their tour to end prematurely . They claimed to have lost $ 20 @,@ 000 . Walker threatened a separate suit demanding $ 1 @,@ 000 . Riley hired Indianapolis lawyer William P. Fishback to represent him and the men settled out of court . The full details of the settlement were never disclosed , but whatever the case , Riley finally extricated himself from his old contracts and became a free agent . The exorbitant amount Riley was being sued for only reinforced public opinion that Riley had been mistreated by his partners , and helped him maintain his image . Nye and Riley remained good friends , and Riley later wrote that Pond and Walker were the source of the problems . 
 Riley 's poetry had become popular in Britain , in large part due to his book Old @-@ Fashioned Roses . In May 1891 he traveled to England to make a tour and what he considered a literary pilgrimage . He landed in Liverpool and traveled first to Dumfries , Scotland , the home and burial place of Robert Burns . Riley had long been compared to Burns by critics because they both used dialect in their poetry and drew inspiration from their rural homes . He then traveled to Edinburgh , York , and London , reciting poetry for gatherings at each stop . Augustin Daly arranged for him to give a poetry reading to prominent British actors in London . Riley was warmly welcomed by its literary and theatrical community and he toured places that Shakespeare had frequented . 
 Riley quickly tired of traveling abroad and began longing for home , writing to his nephew that he regretted having left the United States . He curtailed his journey and returned to New York City in August . He spent the next months in his Greenfield home attempting to write an epic poem , but after several attempts gave up , believing he did not possess the ability . 
 By 1890 , Riley had authored almost all of his famous poems . The few poems he did write during the 1890s were generally less well received by the public . As a solution , Riley and his publishers began reusing poetry from other books and printing some of his earliest works . When <unk> Poems was published in 1891 , a critic working for the Chicago Tribune pointed out the use of Riley 's earliest works , commenting that Riley was using his popularity to push his crude earlier works onto the public only to make money . Riley 's newest poems published in the 1894 book <unk> received very negative reviews that referred to poems like " The Little Dog @-@ <unk> " and " Jargon @-@ Jingle " as " drivel " and to Riley as a " worn out genius . " Most of his growing number of critics suggested that he ignored the quality of the poems for the sake of making money .

 Although Riley was wealthy from his books , he was able to triple his annual income by touring . He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892 . He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in managing his affairs . While Eitel handled the finances , Glass worked to organize his lecture tours . Glass worked closely with Riley 's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books , and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation . He was careful not to book busy schedules ; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short , lasting only three months . 
 During his 1893 tour , Riley lectured mostly in the western United States , and in his 1894 tour in the east . His performances were major events , and generally sold out within days of their announcements . In 1894 he allowed author Douglass Sherley to join his tour . Sherley was a millionaire who published his own books . The literary community had dismissed his work , but Riley was instrumental in helping him to be accepted . 
 In 1895 Riley made his last tour , making stops in most of the major cities in the United States . Advertised as his final performances , there was incredible demand for tickets and Riley performed before his largest audiences during the tour . He and Sherley continued a show very similar to those that he and Nye had done . Riley often lamented the lack of change in the program , but found when he tried to introduce new material , or left out any of his most popular poems , the crowds would demand encores until he agreed to recite their favorites .

 Following the death of his father in 1894 , Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children . To compensate for the lack of his own children , he became a doting uncle , showering gifts on his nieces and nephews . He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and allowed his divorced sister , Mary , his widowed sister @-@ in @-@ law , Julia , and their daughters to live in the home . He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them . He took his nephew Edmund <unk> as a personal secretary and gave him a $ 50 @,@ 000 wedding gift in 1912 . Riley was well loved by his family . 
 Riley returned to live near Indianapolis later in 1893 , boarding in a private home in the Lockerbie district , then a small suburb . He developed a close friendship with his landlords , the <unk> and Holstein families . The home became a destination for local schoolchildren to whom Riley would regularly recite poetry and tell stories . Riley 's friends frequently visited his home , and he developed a closer relationship with Eugene Debs . 
 The same year , he began compiling his poems of most interest to children into a new book entitled Rhymes of Childhood . The book was richly illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy and Riley authored a few new poems for the book under the pseudonym " Uncle Sydney . " Rhymes of Childhood became Riley 's best selling book , and sold millions of copies . It has remained in print continually since 1912 , and helped earn Riley the nickname the " Children 's Poet . " Even Riley 's rival , Clemens , commented that the book was " charming " and made him weep for his " lost youth . "

 Riley had become very wealthy by the time he ended touring in 1895 , and was earning $ 1 @,@ 000 a week . Although he retired , he continued to make minor appearances . In 1896 , Riley performed four shows in Denver . Most of the performances of his later life were at civic celebrations . He was a regular speaker at Decoration Day events and delivered poetry before the unveiling of monuments in Washington , D.C. Newspapers began referring to him as the " National Poet " , " the poet laureate of America " , and " the people 's poet laureate " . Riley wrote many of his patriotic poems for such events , including " The Soldier " , " The Name of Old Glory " , and his most famous such poem , " America ! " . The 1902 poem " America , Messiah of Nations " was written and read by Riley for the dedication of the Indianapolis Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Monument . 
 The only new poetry Riley published after the end of the century were elegies for famous friends . The poetic qualities of the poems were often poor , but they contained many popular sentiments concerning the deceased . Among those he eulogized were Benjamin Harrison , Lew Wallace , and Henry Lawton . Because of the poor quality of the poems , his friends and publishers requested that he stop writing them , but he refused . 
 In 1897 , Riley 's publishers suggested that he create a multi @-@ volume series of books containing his complete life works . With the help of his nephew , Riley began working to compile the books , which eventually totaled sixteen volumes and were finally completed in 1914 . Such works were uncommon during the lives of writers , attesting to the uncommon popularity Riley had achieved . 
 His works had become staples for Ivy League literature courses and universities began offering him honorary degrees . The first was Yale in 1902 , followed by a Doctorate of Letters from the University of Pennsylvania in 1904 . Wabash College and Indiana University granted him similar awards . In 1908 he was elected member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters , and in 1912 they conferred upon him a special medal for poetry . 
 Riley was influential in helping other poets start their careers , having particularly strong influences on Hamlin Garland , William Allen White , and Edgar Lee Masters . He discovered aspiring African American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar in 1892 . Riley thought Dunbar 's work was " worthy of applause " , and wrote him letters of recommendation to help him get his work published . 
 = = = Declining health = = = 
 In 1901 , Riley 's doctor diagnosed him with neurasthenia , a nervous disorder , and recommended long periods of rest as a cure . Riley remained ill for the rest of his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care . During the winter months he moved to Miami , Florida , and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield . He made only a few trips during the decade , including one to Mexico in 1906 . He became very depressed by his condition , writing to his friends that he thought he could die at any moment , and often used alcohol for relief . 
 In March 1909 , Riley was stricken a second time with Bell 's palsy , and partial deafness , the symptoms only gradually eased over the course of the year . Riley was a difficult patient , and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years ; the medicines often worsened his conditions , but his doctors could not sway his opinion . On July 10 , 1910 he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body . Hoping for a quick recovery , his family kept the news from the press until September . Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke , which served only to further depress him . With his health so poor , he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis . In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue . By 1913 , with the aid of a cane , Riley began to recover his ability to walk . His inability to write , however , nearly ended his production of poems . George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated . His publisher continued recycling old works into new books , which remained in high demand . 
 Since the mid @-@ 1880s , Riley had been the nation 's most read poet , a trend that accelerated at the turn of the century . In 1912 Riley recorded readings of his most popular poetry to be sold by Victor Records . Riley was the subject of three paintings by T. C. Steele . The Indianapolis Arts Association commissioned a portrait of Riley to be created by world famous painter John Singer Sargent . Riley 's image became a nationally known icon and many businesses capitalized on his popularity to sell their products ; Hoosier Poet brand vegetables became a major trade @-@ name in the midwest . 
 In 1912 , the governor of Indiana instituted Riley Day on the poet 's birthday . Schools were required to teach Riley 's poems to their children , and banquet events were held in his honor around the state . In 1915 and 1916 the celebration was national after being proclaimed in most states . The annual celebration continued in Indiana until 1968 . In early 1916 Riley was filmed as part of a movie to celebrate Indiana 's centennial , the video is on display at the Indiana State Library . 
 = = = Death and legacy = = = 
 On July 22 , 1916 , Riley suffered a second stroke . He recovered enough during the day to speak and joke with his companions . He died before dawn the next morning , July 23 . Riley 's death shocked the nation and made front page headlines in major newspapers . President Woodrow Wilson wrote a brief note to Riley 's family offering condolences on behalf the entire nation . Indiana Governor Samuel M. Ralston offered to allow Riley to lie in state at the Indiana Statehouse — Abraham Lincoln being the only other person to have previously received such an honor . During the ten hours he lay in state on July 24 , more than thirty @-@ five thousand people filed past his bronze casket ; the line was still miles long at the end of the day and thousands were turned away . The next day a private funeral ceremony was held and attended by many dignitaries . A large funeral procession then carried him to Crown Hill Cemetery where he was buried in a tomb at the top of the hill , the highest point in the city of Indianapolis . 
 Within a year of Riley 's death many memorials were created , including several by the James Whitcomb Riley Memorial Association . The James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children was created and named in his honor by a group of wealthy benefactors and opened in 1924 . In the following years , other memorials intended to benefit children were created , including Camp Riley for youth with disabilities .
