 In his review of the 2006 remaster album , for Mojo magazine , Mat Snow said that " this long overdue reissue is worth it alone for four wonderful songs " , of which " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " " reveals the lusty lad within the orange robes " associated with Hare Krishna devotees . More recently , Snow has described Material World as " a treat for the ears " and Harrison as " an old @-@ school pop <unk> to his marrow , [ who ] worked hard to ensure the choruses of ' Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long , ' ' The Day the World Gets ' Round , ' and ' Who Can See It ' caught the ear with their deep and delicious emotion " . 
 Reviewing the 2014 reissue of Harrison 's Apple catalogue , for Classic Rock , Paul Trynka writes that Living in the Material Word " sparkles with many gems " , and adds : " but it 's the more restrained tracks – Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long , Who Can See It – that entrance : gorgeous pop songs , all the more forceful for their restraint . " Writing for PopMatters , Scot Elingburg pairs the song with " Be Here Now " as " would @-@ be hits " from Material World that " offer much more than just Harrison 's Hindu @-@ inspired teachings ; they also offer up the chance for larger dialogue within music . " Nick DeRiso , co @-@ founder of the music website Something Else ! , includes " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " among the highlights of Harrison 's solo career on Apple Records , and terms it " [ a ] masterpiece of coiled anticipation " . 
 Simon Leng refers to " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " as " one of George Harrison 's most perfect pop confections " , while praising its guitar fills and musical arrangement . Describing it as a " single @-@ that @-@ never @-@ was " , Leng suggests that the song would have been a " certain number 1 " . To Huntley , " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " is " a superlative slice of almost McCartney @-@ esque pop " , with Harrison 's " exquisite slide guitar " a particular highlight .

 In November 1976 , Harrison performed " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " with Paul Simon during the pre @-@ show taping of their joint appearance on NBC Television 's Saturday Night Live . The song was omitted from the broadcast , but the performance is available on the bootleg album Living in the Underground , along with other songs that Harrison and Simon played before the studio audience . 
 In 1977 , " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " was considered for inclusion on Two Man Band , the last of three albums by Splinter on Harrison 's Dark Horse record label . Harrison had suggested they cover the track as a compromise between Splinter 's vision and the commercial requirements initiated by Dark Horse distributor Warner Bros. Records . As much as singer Bob Purvis admired the song , it did not appear on the official release . 
 Following Harrison 's death in November 2001 at the age of 58 , the Late B.P. Helium – formerly Elf Power guitarist Bryan Poole – covered " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " on his 2003 EP <unk> Mae . Splendid Media 's reviewer wrote that Poole " does the Krishna master proud " with his " soulfully earnest rendition " of Harrison 's song .

 Manitoba ( / <unk> / ) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada . It is one of the three prairie provinces ( with Alberta and Saskatchewan ) and Canada 's fifth @-@ most populous province with its estimated about 1 @.@ 3 million people . Manitoba covers 649 @,@ 950 square kilometres ( 250 @,@ 900 sq mi ) with a widely varied landscape . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . 
 Aboriginal peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived in the area when it was part of Rupert 's Land and owned by the Hudson 's Bay Company . In 1867 , negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the rebellion led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 , officially creating the province of Manitoba . 
 Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is Canada 's eighth @-@ largest Census Metropolitan Area . Winnipeg is the seat of government , home to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and the Provincial Court . Four of the province 's five universities and all four of its professional sports teams are in Winnipeg . Other cities in the province are Brandon , Portage la Prairie , Steinbach , Thompson , Winkler , Selkirk , Dauphin , Morden , and <unk> <unk> . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Manitoba is believed to be derived from the Cree , Ojibwe or Assiniboine languages . The name derives from Cree manitou @-@ <unk> or Ojibwa <unk> , both meaning " straits of Manitou , the Great Spirit " , a place referring to what are now called The Narrows in the centre of Lake Manitoba . It may also be from the Assiniboine for " Lake of the Prairie " . 
 The lake was known to French explorers as Lac des Prairies . Thomas Spence chose the name to refer to a new republic he proposed for the area south of the lake . Métis leader Louis Riel also chose the name , and it was accepted in Ottawa under the Manitoba Act of 1870 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Manitoba is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . It adjoins Hudson Bay to the northeast , and is the only prairie province to have a saltwater coastline . The Port of Churchill is the only arctic deep @-@ water port in Canada and the shortest shipping route between North America and Asia . Lake Winnipeg is the tenth @-@ largest freshwater lake in the world . Hudson Bay is the second @-@ largest bay in the world . Manitoba is at the heart of the giant Hudson Bay watershed , once known as Rupert 's Land . It was a vital area of the Hudson 's Bay Company , with many rivers and lakes that provided excellent opportunities for the lucrative fur trade . 
 = = = Hydrography and terrain = = = 
 The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and contains over 110 @,@ 000 lakes , covering approximately 15 @.@ 6 percent or 101 @,@ 593 square kilometres ( 39 @,@ 225 sq mi ) of its surface area . Manitoba 's major lakes are Lake Manitoba , Lake Winnipegosis , and Lake Winnipeg , the tenth @-@ largest freshwater lake in the world . Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on the east side of Lake Winnipeg are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin , with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay . This basin 's rivers reach far west to the mountains , far south into the United States , and east into Ontario . Major watercourses include the Red , Assiniboine , Nelson , Winnipeg , Hayes , <unk> and Churchill rivers . Most of Manitoba 's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz . This region , particularly the Red River Valley , is flat and fertile ; there are hilly and rocky areas throughout the province left by receding glaciers . 
 Baldy Mountain is the province 's highest point at 832 metres ( 2 @,@ 730 ft ) above sea level , and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level . Riding Mountain , the Pembina Hills , Sandilands Provincial Forest , and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions . Much of the province 's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield , including <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Provincial Parks . 
 Extensive agriculture is found only in the province 's southern areas , although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region ( near The Pas ) . The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry ( 34 @.@ 6 % ) , followed by assorted grains ( 19 @.@ 0 % ) and oilseed ( 7 @.@ 9 % ) . Around 12 percent of Canada 's farmland is in Manitoba . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Manitoba has an extreme continental climate . Temperatures and precipitation generally decrease from south to north and increase from east to west . Manitoba is far from the moderating influences of mountain ranges or large bodies of water . Because of the generally flat landscape , it is exposed to cold Arctic high @-@ pressure air masses from the northwest during January and February . In the summer , air masses sometimes come out of the Southern United States , as warm humid air is drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico . Temperatures exceed 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) numerous times each summer , and the combination of heat and humidity can bring the humidex value to the mid @-@ 40s . Carman , Manitoba recorded the second @-@ highest humidex ever in Canada in 2007 , with 53 @.@ 0 . According to Environment Canada , Manitoba ranked first for clearest skies year round , and ranked second for clearest skies in the summer and for the sunniest province in the winter and spring . 
 Southern Manitoba ( including the city of Winnipeg ) , falls into the humid continental climate zone ( Köppen Dfb ) . This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape . Summers are warm with a moderate length . This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces , with moderate precipitation . Southwestern Manitoba , though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba , is closer to the semi @-@ arid interior of Palliser 's Triangle . The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba . This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape . Summers are generally warm to hot , with low to moderate humidity . 
 Southern parts of the province just north of Tornado Alley , experience tornadoes , with 15 confirmed touchdowns in 2006 . In 2007 , on 22 and 23 June , numerous tornadoes touched down , the largest an F5 tornado that devastated parts of Elie ( the strongest recorded tornado in Canada ) . 
 The province 's northern sections ( including the city of Thompson ) fall in the subarctic climate zone ( Köppen climate classification Dfc ) . This region features long and extremely cold winters and brief , warm summers with little precipitation . Overnight temperatures as low as − 40 ° C ( − 40 ° F ) occur on several days each winter . 
 = = = Flora and fauna = = = 
 The province 's eastern , southeastern , and northern reaches range through boreal coniferous forests , muskeg , Canadian Shield and a small section of tundra bordering Hudson Bay . Forests make up about 263 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 102 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , or 48 percent , of the province 's land area . The forests consist of pines ( mostly jack pine , some red pine ) , spruces ( white , black ) , larch , poplars ( trembling aspen , balsam poplar ) , birch ( white , swamp ) and small pockets of eastern white cedar . The tallgrass prairie dominates the southern and particularly the province 's southeastern parts around the Red River Valley , and is notable for its endangered western prairie fringed orchid , whereas the rest of the south and southwest is predominantly mixed grass prairie . There is a broad zone of aspen parkland ecotone . 
 Manitoba is home to a diverse species of animals . The province is especially noted for its polar bear population ; Churchill is commonly referred to as the " Polar Bear Capital " . Other large animals , such as moose , deer , cougars , lynx , and wolves , are common throughout the province , especially in the provincial and national parks . There is a large population of red sided garter snakes near Narcisse ; the dens there are home to the world 's largest concentration of snakes . Manitoba has over 145 species of birds , including the great grey owl , the province 's official bird , and the endangered peregrine falcon . Manitoba 's lakes host 18 species of game fish , particularly species of trout , pike , and <unk> , as well as many smaller fish . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = First Nations and European settlement = = = 
 Modern @-@ day Manitoba was inhabited by the First Nations people shortly after the last ice age glaciers retreated in the southwest about 10 @,@ 000 years ago ; the first exposed land was the Turtle Mountain area . The Ojibwe , Cree , Dene , Sioux , Mandan , and Assiniboine peoples founded settlements , and other tribes entered the area to trade . In Northern Manitoba , quartz was mined to make arrowheads . The first farming in Manitoba was along the Red River , where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with Europeans . 
 In 1611 , Henry Hudson was one of the first Europeans to sail into what is now known as Hudson Bay , where he was abandoned by his crew . The first European to reach present @-@ day central and southern Manitoba was Sir Thomas Button , who travelled upstream along the Nelson River to Lake Winnipeg in 1612 in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue Hudson . When the British ship Nonsuch sailed into Hudson Bay in 1668 – 1669 , she became the first trading vessel to reach the area ; that voyage led to the formation of the Hudson 's Bay Company , to which the British government gave absolute control of the entire Hudson Bay watershed . This watershed was named Rupert 's Land , after Prince Rupert , who helped to subsidize the Hudson 's Bay Company . York Factory was founded in 1684 after the original fort of the Hudson 's Bay Company , Fort Nelson ( built in 1682 ) , was destroyed by rival French traders . 
 Pierre Gaultier de Varennes , sieur de La Vérendrye , visited the Red River Valley in the 1730s to help open the area for French exploration and trade . As French explorers entered the area , a Montreal @-@ based company , the North West Company , began trading with the Métis . Both the North West Company and the Hudson 's Bay Company built fur @-@ trading forts ; the two companies competed in southern Manitoba , occasionally resulting in violence , until they merged in 1821 ( the Hudson 's Bay Company Archives in Winnipeg preserve the history of this era ) . 
 Great Britain secured the territory in 1763 after their victory over France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years ' War , better known as the French and Indian War in North America ; lasting from 1754 to 1763 . The founding of the first agricultural community and settlements in 1812 by Lord Selkirk , north of the area which is now downtown Winnipeg , led to conflict between British colonists and the Métis . Twenty colonists , including the governor , and one Métis were killed in the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816 . Thomas Spence attempted to be President of the Republic of <unk> in 1867 , that he and his council named . 
 = = = Confederation = = = 
 Rupert 's Land was ceded to Canada by the Hudson 's Bay Company in 1869 and incorporated into the Northwest Territories ; a lack of attention to Métis concerns caused Métis leader Louis Riel to establish a local provisional government as part of the Red River Rebellion . In response , Prime Minister John A. Macdonald introduced the Manitoba Act in the Canadian House of Commons , the bill was given Royal Assent and Manitoba was brought into Canada as a province in 1870 . Louis Riel was pursued by British army officer Garnet Wolseley because of the rebellion , and Riel fled into exile . The Canadian government blocked the Métis ' attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of Manitoba 's entry into confederation . Facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from Ontario , large numbers of Métis moved to what would become Saskatchewan and Alberta . 
 Numbered Treaties were signed in the late 19th century with the chiefs of various First Nations that lived in the area . These treaties made specific promises of land for every family . As a result , a reserve system was established under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government . The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given ; this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims , many of which are still ongoing . 
 The original province of Manitoba was a square one @-@ eighteenth of its current size , and was known colloquially as the " postage stamp province " . Its borders were expanded in 1881 , taking land from the Northwest Territories and the District of Keewatin , but Ontario claimed a large portion of the land ; the disputed portion was awarded to Ontario in 1889 . Manitoba grew to its current size in 1912 , absorbing land from the Northwest Territories to reach 60 ° N , uniform with the northern reach of its western neighbours Saskatchewan , Alberta and British Columbia . 
 The Manitoba Schools Question showed the deep divergence of cultural values in the territory . The Catholic Franco @-@ Manitobans had been guaranteed a state @-@ supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba , but a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools . In 1890 , the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools . The French Catholic minority asked the federal government for support ; however , the Orange Order and other anti @-@ Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them . 
 The federal Conservatives proposed remedial legislation to override Manitoba , but they were blocked by the Liberals , led by Wilfrid Laurier , who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights . Once elected Prime Minister in 1896 , Laurier implemented a compromise stating Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it , implemented on a school @-@ by @-@ school basis .

 By 1911 , Winnipeg was the third largest city in Canada , and remained so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s . A boomtown , it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century , with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success . The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 , which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade , as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War . Over 18 @,@ 000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war ; by the end of the war , 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross . 
 After the First World War ended , severe discontent among farmers ( over wheat prices ) and union members ( over wage rates ) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism , coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia . The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919 . It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919 ; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs , the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement . 
 Government efforts to violently crush the strike , including a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death , had led to the arrest of the movement 's leaders . In the aftermath , eight leaders went on trial , and most were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy , illegal combinations , and seditious libel ; four were aliens who were deported under the Canadian Immigration Act . 
 The Great Depression ( 1929 – c . 1939 ) hit especially hard in Western Canada , including Manitoba . The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification , moving away from a reliance on wheat production . The Manitoba Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation , forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba ( NDP ) , was founded in 1932 . 
 Canada entered the Second World War in 1939 . Winnipeg was one of the major commands for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan to train fighter pilots , and there were air training schools throughout Manitoba . Several Manitoba @-@ based regiments were deployed overseas , including Princess Patricia 's Canadian Light Infantry . In an effort to raise money for the war effort , the Victory Loan campaign organized " If Day " in 1942 . The event featured a simulated Nazi invasion and occupation of Manitoba , and eventually raised over C $ 65 million . 
 Winnipeg was inundated during the 1950 Red River Flood and had to be partially evacuated . In that year , the Red River reached its highest level since 1861 and flooded most of the Red River Valley . The damage caused by the flood led then @-@ Premier Duff Roblin to advocate for the construction of the Red River <unk> ; it was completed in 1968 after six years of excavation . Permanent dikes were erected in eight towns south of Winnipeg , and clay dikes and diversion dams were built in the Winnipeg area . In 1997 , the " Flood of the Century " caused over C $ 400 million in damages in Manitoba , but the floodway prevented Winnipeg from flooding . 
 In 1990 , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney attempted to pass the Meech Lake Accord , a series of constitutional amendments to persuade Quebec to endorse the Canada Act 1982 . Unanimous support in the legislature was needed to bypass public consultation . Manitoba politician Elijah Harper , a Cree , opposed because he did not believe First Nations had been adequately involved in the Accord 's process , and thus the Accord failed . 
 In 2013 , Manitoba was the second province to make accessibility legislation law , protecting the rights of persons with disabilities .

 = = = Economic history = = = 
 Manitoba 's early economy depended on mobility and living off the land . Aboriginal Nations ( Cree , Ojibwa , Dene , Sioux and Assiniboine ) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province . After the arrival of the first European traders in the 17th century , the economy centred on the trade of beaver pelts and other furs . Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811 , though the triumph of the Hudson 's Bay Company ( HBC ) over its competitors ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization . 
 HBC control of Rupert 's Land ended in 1868 ; when Manitoba became a province in 1870 , all land became the property of the federal government , with homesteads granted to settlers for farming . Transcontinental railways were constructed to simplify trade . Manitoba 's economy depended mainly on farming , which persisted until drought and the Great Depression led to further diversification .

 = = Government and politics = = 
 After the control of Rupert 's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869 , Manitoba attained full @-@ fledged rights and responsibilities of self @-@ government as the first Canadian province carved out of the Northwest Territories . The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870 . Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883 , with a two @-@ party system ( Liberals and Conservatives ) . The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922 , and later merged with the Liberals in 1932 . Other parties , including the Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) , appeared during the Great Depression ; in the 1950s , Manitoban politics became a three @-@ party system , and the Liberals gradually declined in power . The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba ( NDP ) , which came to power in 1969 . Since then , the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties . 
 Like all Canadian provinces , Manitoba is governed by a unicameral legislative assembly . The executive branch is formed by the governing party ; the party leader is the premier of Manitoba , the head of the executive branch . The head of state , Queen Elizabeth II , is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba , who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on advice of the Prime Minister . The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role , although the Lieutenant Governor has the official responsibility of ensuring that Manitoba has a duly constituted government . 
 The Legislative Assembly consists of the 57 Members elected to represent the people of Manitoba . The premier of Manitoba is Brian Pallister of the PC Party . The PCs were elected with a majority government of 40 seats . The NDP holds 14 seats , and the Liberal Party have three seats but does not have official party status in the Manitoba Legislature . The last provincial general election was held on 19 April 2016 . The province is represented in federal politics by 14 Members of Parliament and six Senators . 
 Manitoba 's judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal , the Court of Queen 's Bench , and the Provincial Court . The Provincial Court is primarily for criminal law ; 95 percent of criminal cases in Manitoba are heard here . The Court of Queen 's Bench is the highest trial court in the province . It has four jurisdictions : family law ( child and family services cases ) , civil law , criminal law ( for indictable offences ) , and appeals . The Court of Appeal hears appeals from both benches ; its decisions can only be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada . 
 = = = Official languages = = = 
 English and French are the official languages of the legislature and courts of Manitoba , according to § 23 of the Manitoba Act , 1870 ( part of the Constitution of Canada ) . In April 1890 , the Manitoba legislature attempted to abolish the official status of French , and ceased to publish bilingual legislation . However , in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights that § 23 still applied , and that legislation published only in English was invalid ( <unk> legislation was declared valid for a temporary period to allow time for translation ) . 
 Although French is an official language for the purposes of the legislature , legislation , and the courts , the Manitoba Act does not require it to be an official language for the purpose of the executive branch ( except when performing legislative or judicial functions ) . Hence , Manitoba 's government is not completely bilingual . The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages . According to the 2006 Census , 82 @.@ 8 percent of Manitoba 's population spoke only English , 3 @.@ 2 percent spoke only French , 15 @.@ 1 percent spoke both , and 0 @.@ 9 percent spoke neither .

 = = Education = = 
 The first school in Manitoba was founded in 1818 by Roman Catholic missionaries in present @-@ day Winnipeg ; the first Protestant school was established in 1820 . A provincial board of education was established in 1871 ; it was responsible for public schools and curriculum , and represented both Catholics and Protestants . The Manitoba Schools Question led to funding for French Catholic schools largely being withdrawn in favour of the English Protestant majority . Legislation making education compulsory for children between seven and fourteen was first enacted in 1916 , and the leaving age was raised to sixteen in 1962 . 
 Public schools in Manitoba fall under the regulation of one of thirty @-@ seven school divisions within the provincial education system ( except for the Manitoba Band Operated Schools , which are administered by the federal government ) . Public schools follow a provincially mandated curriculum in either French or English . There are sixty @-@ five funded independent schools in Manitoba , including three boarding schools .

 = French battleship République = 
 République was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the French Navy built in the early 1900s . The lead ship of her class , she had only one sister ship : Patrie . The ship was built by the Arsenal de Brest , laid down in December 1901 , launched in September 1902 , and commissioned into the fleet in December 1906 , the same time as the revolutionary British battleship HMS Dreadnought . Armed with a main battery of four 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns , she was outclassed by Dreadnought by the time she entered service . 
 République served in the Mediterranean Fleet for the duration of her career . In 1910 she was accidentally torpedoed by Patrie . She was moored near the battleship Liberté when the latter exploded accidentally in 1911 , and was damaged by flying debris . After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she covered troop convoys from Algeria to France , and participated in the sinking of the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser SMS Zenta later that month . She spent the majority of the war in Corfu at the mouth of the Adriatic Sea , to keep the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet bottled up in the Adriatic . She was eventually stricken in 1921 and broken up for scrap thereafter .

 République was laid down at the Arsenal de Brest in December 1901 , launched on 4 September 1902 , and completed in December 1906 , at the same time as the revolutionary British battleship HMS Dreadnought , which rendered the pre @-@ dreadnoughts like République outdated . The ship was 133 @.@ 81 meters ( 439 ft 0 in ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 24 @.@ 26 m ( 79 ft 7 in ) and a full @-@ load draft of 8 @.@ 41 m ( 27 ft 7 in ) . She displaced 14 @,@ 605 metric tons ( 14 @,@ 374 long tons ; 16 @,@ 099 short tons ) at full load and had a crew of between 766 and 825 officers and enlisted men . She was powered by three vertical triple expansion engines with twenty @-@ four Niclausse boilers . They were rated at 18 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 13 @,@ 420 kW ) and provided a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . Coal storage amounted to 1 @,@ 800 t ( 1 @,@ 770 long tons ; 1 @,@ 980 short tons ) . 
 République 's main battery consisted of four Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893 / 96 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets , one forward and one aft . The secondary battery consisted of eighteen Canon de 164 mm Modèle 1893 guns ; twelve were mounted in twin turrets , and six in casemates in the hull . She also carried twenty @-@ five 3 @-@ pounder guns . The ship was also armed with two 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes submerged in the hull . The ship 's main belt was 280 mm ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) thick and the main battery was protected by up to 350 mm ( 13 @.@ 8 in ) of armor . The conning tower had 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) thick sides . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After commissioning in December 1906 , République conducted her sea trials . During the speed trials , she reached a top speed of 19 @.@ 15 knots ( 35 @.@ 47 km / h ; 22 @.@ 04 mph ) , more than a knot faster than her contract speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . In 1907 , after joining the fleet , République took first place in the annual gunnery competition . She was assigned to the 1st Division of the Mediterranean Fleet , along with her sister Patrie and Suffren , the divisional flagship . 
 On 16 February 1910 , during exercises in the Gulf of <unk> , a torpedo was accidentally launched from her sister ship Patrie . The torpedo struck République , damaging her hull . On 25 September 1911 , the battleship Liberté was moored near Republique in Toulon . An accidental explosion , the result of the spontaneous combustion of nitrocellulose gel , occurred aboard Liberté ; she was destroyed and debris was hurled into the air . République was hit by a 37 @-@ metric @-@ ton ( 36 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 41 @-@ short @-@ ton ) piece of armor plate from Liberté , on the starboard quarter directly behind the main battery turret . 
 At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , République was assigned to the 1st Division of the 2nd Squadron in the Mediterranean , along with Patrie and the flagship , Vérité ; this was the main battle fleet of the French Navy . The French fleet was initially used to cover the movement of French troops — the XIX Corps — from Algeria to metropolitan France . As a result , the fleet was far out of position to catch the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben . For the majority of the war , the French used their main fleet to keep the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet bottled up in the Adriatic Sea . In 1914 she participated in the Battle of Antivari , where the battle line caught the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser SMS Zenta by surprise and sank her . The French battleships then bombarded Austrian fortifications at Cattaro in an attempt to draw out the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet , which refused to take the bait . 
 The French operations in the area were hampered by a lack of a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic ; the British had given the French free access to Malta , but it was hundreds of miles away . The Austrians also possessed several submarines , one of which torpedoed the dreadnought Jean Bart in December 1914 . The threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic . As the war progressed , the French eventually settled on Corfu as their primary naval base in the area . Together with the pre @-@ dreadnought Gaulois , the ship covered the Allied evacuation from Gallipoli in January 1916 . 
 Later in 1916 , République , Patrie , and the surviving Liberté @-@ class battleships supported Allied operations in Salonica and also detached landing parties to support the Allied attempt to force Greek acquiescence for those operations in Athens on 1 December . They spent the rest of the war at Salonica and Athens . During the war , four of République 's 3 @-@ pounder guns were converted into anti @-@ aircraft guns with new high @-@ angle mounts . After the end of the war , République was placed in reserve in 1919 , along with Patrie . She was disarmed the following year and subsequently stricken from the naval register in 1921 and broken up for scrap . 
 = Mutiny of the Matoika = 
 Mutiny of the Matoika is the common name for the events in July 1920 involving a large portion of the Olympic team of the United States while on board the U.S. Army transport ship Princess Matoika , headed to Antwerp for the 1920 Summer Olympics . Princess Matoika was a last @-@ minute substitute for another ship and , according to the athletes , did not have adequate accommodations or training facilities on board . Near the end of the voyage , the athletes published a list of grievances and demands and distributed copies of the document to the United States Secretary of War , the American Olympic Committee ( AOC ) members , and the press . The incident received wide coverage in American newspapers at the time and was still being discussed in the popular press years later . The event was not a mutiny in the traditional sense , but has been called that since the mid @-@ 1930s . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1920 , the number of ocean liners carrying passengers on the North Atlantic gradually increased , but was still far below the pre @-@ war years ; arrivals at Atlantic ports in the United States were still down some 60 % from pre @-@ war numbers . With the fewer ships and sailings available , the AOC made arrangements with both the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy to transport the United States Olympic team to Antwerp . The Navy agreed to carry team members who were affiliated with their branch of the service , and the Army , to carry civilian and Army @-@ affiliated competitors . The Olympic trip got off to a bad start when the Army 's scheduled ship , Northern Pacific , was declared unseaworthy , requiring a last @-@ minute substitution . The last @-@ minute selection of the Matoika meant the original planned departure date , July 20 , had to be pushed back by six days to ready the liner to sail . 
 The Matoika had been in the service of the U.S. Army as a transport ship since September 1919 , and , until the time of her selection , had been returning American soldiers from Europe and repatriating the remains of Americans killed during the war . Before World War I , the Matoika had been a passenger liner for North German Lloyd by the name of Princess Alice . After the United States joined the conflict in 1917 , the liner had been pressed into service for the U.S. Navy carrying American troops to Europe ; she was renamed Princess Matoika , after one of the given names for Pocahontas , as part of an order to replace Germanic names of seized ships with American names . 
 = = Voyage = = 
 On the afternoon of July 26 , the athletes attended a farewell reception at the Manhattan Opera House presided over by Gustavus T. Kirby , chairman of the American Olympic Committee ( AOC ) , who read congratulatory telegrams to the team from the governors of eleven states . At the end of the reception , the 230 civilian and U.S. Army @-@ affiliated team members marched from the Opera House to the Hudson Pier and ferried to Hoboken , New Jersey , and the waiting Matoika . ( The 101 U.S. Navy @-@ affiliated athletes and coaches were carried on cruiser USS Frederick , a frequent convoy escort of Princess Matoika during World War I. ) 
 When female team members , AOC members , and U.S. Army athletes and officials accompanying the team were assigned first @-@ class cabins and the balance of the male athletes were relegated to troop quarters on lower decks , grumbling from team members quartered belowdecks began almost immediately . Before the Matoika even sailed , runner Joie Ray , a competitor in the 1500 meters in 1920 , complained about the conditions declaring that " if those in charge had deliberately tried to create a psychology of depression and resentment among the members of the team , they couldn 't have done anything more effective " . Two days after sailing , some of the first @-@ place winners at the Olympic tryouts were moved to the sick bay to escape the sweltering heat on the lower decks , but the majority remained below . Fencer Joseph B. B. Parker — who , as an Army athlete , was <unk> in a cabin — commented that the troop accommodations were all right for troops but " not conducive to bringing men to the games in the pink of condition . " 
 Training conditions aboard the ship were less than ideal throughout the voyage . Rough seas for parts of the journey hampered training and contributed to widespread seasickness . Although the long distance runners were able to practice by making multiple circuits of the ship , the sprinters and hurdlers were provided only a 70 @-@ yard ( 64 m ) cork track — two @-@ thirds the length of the shortest track event at the games — on which to practice . Javelins were tethered by rope and aimed by their throwers at the sea , and , when thrown , would often come down in unexpected locations . The only facility for swimmers was a canvas saltwater tank set up on the lower deck ; the tank split when filled for the first time . Even after it was repaired , the best the swimmers could do was to practice strokes while tied to the corner of the tank with a rope , and divers , with no other facilities available , were allocated just a few minutes a day in the tank . Conditions on the ship contributed to several injuries to athletes . During foggy weather , American decathlete Everett Ellis fell on the slippery deck , suffering a bad sprain , and shot putter Pat McDonald sprained his thumb while tossing a medicine ball on the pitching deck . 
 Despite the problems encountered by some of the team , others were able to work out adequately . <unk> , wrestlers , and boxers were all able to work out in close @-@ to @-@ usual routines . But perhaps the most impressive training feat was a high jump by Richmond W. Landon who cleared a 5 @-@ foot @-@ 10 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 78 m ) high jump on the rolling deck , a jump not far off of his eventual gold @-@ medal @-@ winning ( and Olympic record ) jump of 6 feet 4 @.@ 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 935 m ) . 
 = = The " mutiny " = = 
 By the time the ship neared Antwerp , the team members had had enough of the " rusty old troop carrier " . The team initially threatened to boycott the games if the conditions in the host city were not better than those aboard the Matoika , but quickly rescinded that . The group , with McDonald and Norman Ross serving as ringleaders , drafted a resolution in which they condemned the AOC and outlined their grievances and demands : 
 the quarters aboard the ship were unlivable 
 the food on board was terrible . 
 they requested better accommodation in Antwerp 
 they requested cabin passage on the way home 
 and they requested train fare to their homes from New York after returning . 
 They were careful to give credit to the crew of Princess Matoika who , in the athletes ' assessment , did " everything possible to improve conditions " . The document was signed by 150 of the athletes ; some of the U.S. Army athletes agreed with the resolution but could not sign it . They had 200 copies of the resolution printed and addressed copies to Secretary of War Newton Diehl Baker , the members of the AOC , and members of the press . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After the Olympics were over , fencer Parker summarized the situation by saying that all who made the trip would want to compete for the United States in future Olympics , but " never again … under the management of the Executive Committee of the Olympic team of 1920 " . In 1922 , author Newton <unk> brought up the specter of the 1920 Olympic passage on the Matoika when discussing the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) and his hopes that the NCAA would take over the functions of the Amateur Athletic Union in controlling American Olympic teams in the future . 
 By the mid @-@ 1930s , the events on board were known as the " Mutiny of the Matoika " . Sportswriter John Kieran , in his 1936 book The Story of the Olympic Games : 776 B.C. to 1960 A.D. , related the story of the mutiny by that name .

Another film was under production when the studio was closed following the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies . Star helped establish the careers of actors such as S Waldy and Elly Joenara , and produced screenplays written by Rd Ariffien and Saeroen ; its output , however , is probably lost . 
 = = History = = 
 Star Film was established by Jo Eng Sek , who had previous film experience as co @-@ producer of Si Tjonat ( 1929 ) , and Shanghai @-@ based cameraman Cho ' Chin Hsin ; for much of the life of the company , Jo would take the role of producer while Cho ' would be on camera . The company 's headquarters were located at Prinsenlaan , Batavia ( now Mangga Besar , Jakarta ) . The company released its first film , Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman , in April 1941 . For this detective film , Star signed L. V. Wijnhamer Jr . , an Indo social worker popular with the ethnic Chinese community . The film was a commercial success , allowing the company to expand . 
 Later Jo signed Rd Ariffien as a screenwriter ; the studio touted this as a victory , owing to Ariffien 's wide network as a journalist . He wrote a single work for the company , Tjioeng Wanara , based on the Sundanese legend as retold by M. A. Salmoen in a 1938 Balai Pustaka @-@ published edition ; this was directed and produced by Jo . Several actors cast for the film continued with Star for the remainder of its existence , including comedian S Waldy and future film producer Elly Joenara . However , Ariffien left Star owing to dissatisfaction over Tjioeng Wanara . 
 Star continued expanding , and Jo brought aboard Chinese director Wu Tsun , whose first film for the company was Lintah Darat . It had begun production before the release of Tjioeng Wanara and dealt with a family torn apart by dealings with a loan shark . This production received positive reviews . Star then produced a sequel to Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman , again with Wu at the helm , and drew the journalist Saeroen as writer . In this film , titled Pah Wongso Tersangka , Star emphasised comedy , relying on the interactions between Waldy , Pah Wongso , and the comedian <unk> . 
 Saeroen wrote one more film for Star in 1941 , Ajah <unk> , before leaving the company . This film , which follows a villager named <unk> over a period of several years in which he loses everything owing to his infatuation with a " modern " woman , was advertised as " an extremely simple and touching story " and received positive reviews . By late 1941 , Star was producing an adaptation of the One Thousand and One Nights , titled 1001 Malam . At the time several contemporary works were being adapted from Nights , including Tan 's Film 's Aladin and Koeda Sembrani , Populair 's Film 's Moestika dari Djemar , and Java Industrial Film 's Ratna Moetoe Manikam . 
 By early 1942 , the colonial government of the Dutch East Indies had become concerned with the possibility of an invasion by the Empire of Japan . This fear reached the general populace , and the February 1942 edition of film magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film reported that several studios would move away from the colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus . Star , though production of 1001 Malam was incomplete , was reported to be preparing to move . When the Japanese occupied the Indies in March 1942 , Star was closed , never to reopen .

 = Edward VIII abdication crisis = 
 In 1936 , a constitutional crisis in the British Empire arose when King @-@ Emperor Edward VIII proposed to marry Wallis Simpson , an American socialite who was divorced from her first husband and was pursuing a divorce of her second . 
 The marriage was opposed by the governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth . Religious , legal , political and moral objections were raised . As British monarch , Edward was the nominal head of the Church of England , which did not then allow divorced people to remarry if their ex @-@ spouses were still alive , so it was widely believed that Edward could not marry Simpson and remain on the throne . Simpson was perceived to be politically and socially unsuitable as a consort because of her two failed marriages . It was widely assumed by the Establishment that she was driven by love of money or position rather than love for the King . Despite the opposition , Edward declared that he loved Simpson and intended to marry her whether his governments approved or not . 
 The widespread unwillingness to accept Simpson as the King 's consort , and Edward 's refusal to give her up , led to his abdication in December 1936 . He remains the only British monarch to have voluntarily renounced the throne since the Anglo @-@ Saxon period . He was succeeded by his brother Albert , who took the regnal name of George VI . Edward was given the title His Royal Highness the Duke of Windsor following his abdication , and he married Simpson the following year . They remained married until his death 35 years later .

 Edward had been introduced to Wallis Simpson , an American citizen and wife of British shipping executive Ernest Aldrich Simpson , by Lady Furness on 10 January 1931 . Ernest Simpson was Wallis 's second husband ; her first marriage , to U.S. Navy pilot Win Spencer , had ended in divorce in 1927 . It is generally accepted that Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales became lovers in 1934 , while Lady Furness ( who was also in a relationship with the prince ) was visiting relatives in America . However , Edward adamantly insisted to his father that he was not physically intimate with Simpson and that it was inappropriate to describe her as his mistress . Edward 's relationship with Simpson further weakened his poor relationship with his parents . Although King George V and Queen Mary met Simpson at Buckingham Palace in 1935 , they later refused to receive her . Edward and Simpson were secretly followed by members of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch , who produced reports on the nature of their relationship and their investigations into Wallis Simpson 's private life that included the " pursuit of vicious gossip " and the identification of a " secret lover " . " The prospect of having an American divorcee with a questionable past having such sway over the heir apparent led to anxiety among government and establishment figures . 
 Edward VIII succeeded his father on 20 January 1936 , after which Simpson attended more official functions as the King 's guest . Despite her name appearing regularly in the Court Circular , the name of her husband was conspicuously absent . In the summer of that year , the King eschewed the traditional prolonged stay at Balmoral in favour of a holiday with Simpson in the eastern Mediterranean that was widely covered in the American and continental European press , but not by the British press , which maintained a self @-@ imposed silence . Nevertheless , Canadians and expatriate Britons , who had access to the foreign reports , were largely scandalised by the coverage . 
 By October , it was rumoured in high society and abroad that Edward intended to marry Simpson as soon as she was free to do so . At the end of that month , the crisis came to a head when she filed for divorce and the American press announced that marriage between her and the King was imminent . The King 's private secretary , Alec Hardinge , wrote to him on 13 November , warning : " The silence in the British Press on the subject of Your Majesty 's friendship with Mrs Simpson is not going to be maintained ... Judging by the letters from British subjects living in foreign countries where the Press has been outspoken , the effect will be calamitous . " Senior British ministers knew that Hardinge had written to the King and may have helped him draft the letter . 
 The King invited Prime Minister Baldwin to Buckingham Palace the following Monday ( 16 November ) and informed him that he intended to marry Simpson . Baldwin replied that such a marriage would not be acceptable to the people , stating : " ... the Queen becomes the Queen of the country . Therefore in the choice of a Queen the voice of the people must be heard . " Baldwin 's view was shared by the Australian High Commissioner in London , Stanley Bruce , who was a former Australian prime minister . On the same day that Hardinge wrote to the King , Bruce met Hardinge and then wrote to Baldwin , expressing horror at the idea of a marriage between the King and Simpson . 
 Nevertheless , the British press remained quiet on the subject until Alfred Blunt , Bishop of Bradford , gave a speech to his diocesan conference on 1 December , which alluded to the King 's need of divine grace : " We hope that he is aware of his need . Some of us wish that he gave more positive signs of his awareness . " The press took this for the first public comment by a notable person on the crisis and it became front page news the following day . When asked about it later , however , the bishop claimed he had not heard of Simpson at the time he wrote the speech . Acting on the advice of Edward 's staff , Simpson left Britain for the south of France two days later in an attempt to escape intense press attention . Both she and the King were devastated by the separation . At a tearful departure , the King told her , " I shall never give you up . " 
 = = Opposition = = 
 Opposition to the King and his marriage came from several directions . Edward 's desire to modernise the monarchy and make it more accessible , though appreciated by many of the public , was distrusted by the British Establishment . Edward upset the aristocracy by treating their traditions and ceremonies with disdain , and many were offended by his abandonment of accepted social norms and mores . 
 = = = Social and moral = = = 
 The King 's ministers and family found Wallis Simpson 's background and behaviour unacceptable for a queen . Rumours and innuendo about her circulated in society . The King 's mother , the dowager Queen Mary , was even told that Simpson might have held some sort of sexual control over Edward , as she had released him from an undefined sexual dysfunction through practices learnt in a Chinese brothel . This view was partially shared by Dr. Alan Campbell Don , Chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury , who wrote that he suspected the King " is sexually abnormal which may account for the hold Mrs. S. has over him " . Even Edward VIII 's official biographer , Philip Ziegler , noted that : " There must have been some sort of sadomasochistic relationship ... [ Edward ] relished the contempt and bullying she bestowed on him . " 
 Police detectives following Simpson reported back that , while involved with Edward , she was also involved with a married car mechanic and salesman named Guy Trundle . This may well have been passed on to senior figures in the establishment , including members of the royal family . Joseph Kennedy , the American ambassador , described her as a " tart " , and his wife , Rose , refused to dine with her . 
 Wallis was perceived to be pursuing Edward for his money ; his equerry wrote that she would eventually leave him , " having secured the cash " . The future prime minister Neville Chamberlain ( then Chancellor of the Exchequer ) wrote in his diary that she was " an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with the King but is exploiting him for her own purposes . She has already ruined him in money and jewels ... " 
 Relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were strained during the inter @-@ war years and the majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort . At the time , some members of the British upper class looked down on Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior . In contrast , the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage , as was most of the American press . 
 = = = Religious and legal = = = 
 In Edward 's lifetime , the Church of England did not allow divorced people to remarry in church while a former spouse was still living . The monarch was required to be in communion with the Church of England , and was its nominal head . If Edward married Wallis Simpson , a divorcee who would soon have two living ex @-@ husbands , in a civil ceremony it would conflict with his ex officio role as Supreme Governor of the Church of England . 
 Wallis 's first divorce ( in the United States on the grounds of " emotional incompatibility " ) was not recognised by the Church of England and , if challenged in the English courts , might not have been recognised under English law . At that time , the church and English law considered adultery to be the only grounds for divorce . Consequently , under this argument , her second ( and third ) marriages would have been bigamous and invalid . 
 = = = Political = = = 
 When Edward visited depressed mining villages in Wales , his comment that " something must be done " led to concerns among elected politicians that he would interfere in political matters , traditionally avoided by constitutional monarchs . Ramsay MacDonald , Lord President of the Council , wrote of the King 's comments : " These escapades should be limited . They are an invasion into the field of politics & should be watched constitutionally . " Although Edward 's comments had made him popular in Wales , he became extremely unpopular with the public in Scotland following his refusal to open a new wing of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary , saying he could not do so because he was in mourning for his father . The day after the opening he was pictured in newspapers on holiday : he had turned down the public event in favour of meeting Simpson . 
 As Prince of Wales , Edward had publicly referred to Labour county councillors as " cranks " and made speeches counter to government policy . During his reign as king , his refusal to accept the advice of ministers continued : he opposed the imposition of sanctions on Italy after its invasion of Ethiopia , refused to receive the deposed Emperor of Ethiopia , and would not support a strengthening of the League of Nations . 
 Members of the British government became further dismayed by the proposed marriage after being told that Wallis Simpson was an agent of Nazi Germany . The Foreign Office obtained leaked dispatches from the German Reich 's Ambassador to the United Kingdom , Joachim von Ribbentrop , which revealed his strong view that opposition to the marriage was motivated by the wish " to defeat those Germanophile forces which had been working through Mrs. Simpson " . It was rumoured that Simpson had access to confidential government papers sent to Edward , which he left unguarded at his Fort Belvedere residence . While Edward was abdicating , the personal protection officers guarding Simpson in exile in France sent reports to Downing Street suggesting that she might " flit to Germany " . 
 = = Options considered = = 
 As a result of these rumours and arguments , the belief strengthened among the British establishment that Simpson could not become a royal consort . British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin explicitly advised Edward that the majority of people would be opposed to his marrying Simpson , indicating that if he did , in direct contravention of his ministers ' advice , the government would resign en masse . The King responded , according to his own account later : " I intend to marry Mrs. Simpson as soon as she is free to marry ... if the Government opposed the marriage , as the Prime Minister had given me reason to believe it would , then I was prepared to go . " Under pressure from the King , and " startled " at the suggested abdication , Baldwin agreed to take further soundings on three options : 
 Edward and Simpson marry and she become queen ( a royal marriage ) ; 
 Edward and Simpson marry , but she not become queen , instead receiving some courtesy title ( a morganatic marriage ) ; or 
 Abdication for Edward and any potential heirs he might father , allowing him to make any marital decisions without further constitutional implications . 
 The second option had European precedents , including Edward 's own great @-@ grandfather , Duke Alexander of Württemberg , but it had no parallel in British constitutional history . The prime ministers of the five Dominions ( Australia , Canada , New Zealand , South Africa , and the Irish Free State ) were consulted , and the majority agreed that there was " no alternative to course ( 3 ) " . William Lyon Mackenzie King ( Prime Minister of Canada ) , Joseph Lyons ( Prime Minister of Australia ) , and J. B. M. Hertzog ( Prime Minister of South Africa ) opposed options 1 and 2 . Mackenzie King told Edward to do " what he believed in his own heart was right " and the Canadian government appealed to the King to put his duty before his feelings for Simpson . Governor General of Canada Lord <unk> told Buckingham Palace and Baldwin that Canadians held deep affection for the King , but also that Canadian public opinion would be outraged if Edward married a divorcee . Michael Joseph Savage ( Prime Minister of New Zealand ) rejected option 1 and thought that option 2 " might be possible ... if some solution along these lines were found to be practicable " , but " would be guided by the decision of the Home government " . In communications with the British government , Éamon de Valera , ( President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State ) , remarked that as a Roman Catholic country , the Irish Free State did not recognise divorce . He supposed that if the British people would not accept Wallis Simpson then abdication was the only possible solution . On 24 November , Baldwin consulted the three leading opposition politicians in Britain : Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee , Liberal leader Sir Archibald Sinclair , and Winston Churchill . Sinclair and Attlee agreed that options 1 and 2 were unacceptable , and Churchill pledged to support the government . 
 Churchill did not support the government , however . In July , he had advised the King 's legal counsel , Walter Monckton , against the divorce , but his advice was ignored . As soon as the affair became public knowledge , Churchill started to pressure Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted . In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson , the editor of The Times newspaper , Churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because , given time , the King might fall out of love with Simpson . Baldwin rejected the request for delay , presumably because he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly . Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin , Geoffrey Dawson , and Cosmo Gordon Lang , the Archbishop of Canterbury . The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease , but he eventually accepted , on the evidence of an early <unk> , that Baldwin 's heart was sound . 
 Political support for the King was scattered and comprised politicians outside of the mainstream parties such as Churchill , Oswald Mosley , and the Communists . David Lloyd George also supported the King despite disliking Simpson . He was , however , unable to take any active role in the crisis because he was on holiday in Jamaica with his mistress . In early December , rumours circulated that the King 's supporters would join together in a " King 's Party " , led by Churchill . However , there was no concerted effort to form an organised movement and Churchill had no intention of leading one . Nevertheless , the rumours damaged the King and Churchill severely , as members of parliament were horrified at the idea of the King interfering in politics . 
 The letters and diaries of working @-@ class people and ex @-@ servicemen generally demonstrate support for the King , while those from the middle and upper classes tend to express indignation and distaste . The Times , The Morning Post , Daily Herald , and newspapers owned by Lord Kemsley , such as The Daily Telegraph , opposed the marriage . On the other hand , the Express and Mail newspapers , owned by Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere , respectively , appeared to support a morganatic marriage . The King estimated that the newspapers in favour had a circulation of 12 @.@ 5 million , and those against had 8 @.@ 5 million . 
 On 3 December , Edward had a " tense " meeting with Baldwin . Backed by Churchill and Beaverbrook , Edward proposed to broadcast a speech via the BBC . The proposed text invoked the " ancient custom " for a King to " address his public utterances to his people " . Edward proposed to remind his listeners : " I am still the same man whose motto was ' Ich Dien ' , I serve . " In the proposed speech , Edward indicated his desire to remain on the throne or to be recalled to it if forced to abdicate , while marrying Simpson morganatically . In one section , Edward proposed to say : 
 Neither Mrs. Simpson nor I have ever sought to insist that she should be queen . All we desired was that our married happiness should carry with it a proper title and dignity for her , befitting my wife . Now that I have at last been able to take you into my confidence , I feel it is best to go away for a while , so that you may reflect calmly and quietly , but without undue delay , on what I have said . 
 Baldwin blocked the speech , saying that it would shock many people and would be a grave breach of constitutional principles . By modern convention , the sovereign could only act with the advice and counsel of ministers . In seeking the people 's support against the government , Edward was opting to oppose binding ministerial advice and instead act as a private individual . Edward 's British ministers felt that , in proposing the speech , Edward had revealed his disdainful attitude towards constitutional conventions and threatened the political neutrality of the Crown . 
 Cabinet Office files released in 2013 show that on or before 5 December 1936 , the Home Secretary , Sir John Simon , had ordered the General Post Office ( which controlled British telephone services ) to intercept " telephone communications between Fort Belvedere and Buckingham Palace on the one hand and the continent of Europe on the other . " 
 On 5 December , having in effect been told that he could not keep the throne and marry Simpson , and having had his request to broadcast to the Empire to explain " his side of the story " blocked on constitutional grounds , Edward chose the third option . 
 = = Legal manoeuvres = = 
 Following Simpson 's divorce hearing on 27 October 1936 , her solicitor , John Theodore Goddard , became concerned that there would be a " patriotic " citizen 's intervention ( a legal device to block the divorce ) , and that such an intervention would be successful . The courts could not grant a collaborative divorce ( a dissolution of marriage consented to by both parties ) , and so the case was being handled as if it were an undefended at @-@ fault divorce brought against Ernest Simpson , with Wallis Simpson as the innocent , injured party . The divorce action would fail if the citizen 's intervention showed that the Simpsons had colluded by , for example , conniving in or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else . On Monday 7 December 1936 , the King heard that Goddard planned to fly to the south of France to see Wallis Simpson . The King summoned him and expressly forbade him to make the journey , fearing that the visit might put doubts in Simpson 's mind . Goddard went straight to Downing Street to see Baldwin , as a result of which he was provided with an aeroplane to take him directly to Cannes . 
 Upon his arrival , Goddard warned his client that a citizen 's intervention , should it arise , was likely to succeed . It was , according to Goddard , his duty to advise her to withdraw her divorce petition . Simpson refused , but they both telephoned the King to inform him that she was willing to give him up so that he could remain king . It was , however , too late ; the King had already made up his mind to go , even if he could not marry Simpson . Indeed , as the belief that the abdication was inevitable gathered strength , Goddard stated that : " [ his ] client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but the other end of the wicket [ Edward VIII ] was determined " . 
 Goddard had a weak heart and had never flown before , so he asked his doctor , William Kirkwood , to accompany him on the trip . As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital , his presence led to false speculation that Simpson was pregnant , and even that she was having an abortion . The press excitedly reported that the solicitor had flown to Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist ( who was actually the lawyer 's clerk ) . 
 = = Abdication = = 
 At Fort Belvedere , on 10 December , Edward signed his written abdication notices , witnessed by his three younger brothers : Prince Albert , Duke of York ( who succeeded Edward as George VI ) ; Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester ; and Prince George , Duke of Kent . The following day , it was given legislative form by special Act of Parliament : His Majesty 's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 . Under changes introduced in 1931 by the Statute of Westminster , a single Crown for the entire empire had been replaced by multiple crowns , one for each Dominion , worn by a single monarch in an organisation then known as the British Commonwealth . Though the British government , hoping for expediency and to avoid embarrassment , wished the Dominions to accept the actions of the home government , the Dominions held that Edward 's abdication required the consent of each Commonwealth state . This was duly given ; by the Parliament of Australia , which was at the time in session , and by the governments of the other Dominions , whose parliaments were in recess . The government of the Irish Free State , taking the opportunity presented by the crisis and in a major step towards its eventual transition to a republic , passed an amendment to its constitution on 11 December to remove references to the Crown . The King 's abdication was recognised a day later in the External Relations Act of the Irish Free State and legislation eventually passed in South Africa declared that the abdication took effect there on 10 December . As Edward VIII had not been crowned , his planned coronation date became that of George VI instead . 
 Edward 's supporters felt that he had " been hounded from the throne by that arch humbug Baldwin " , but many members of the establishment were relieved by Edward 's departure . Mackenzie King wrote in his diary on 8 December 1936 that Edward 's " sense of right or wrong has been largely obliterated by the jazz of life he has led for years " and , upon receiving news of Edward 's final decision to abdicate , " if that is the kind of man he is it is better he should not be longer on the Throne . " Edward 's own Assistant Private Secretary , Alan Lascelles , had told Baldwin as early as 1927 : " I can 't help thinking that the best thing that could happen to him , and to the country , would be for him to break his neck . " 
 On 11 December 1936 , Edward made a BBC radio broadcast from Windsor Castle ; having abdicated , he was introduced by Sir John Reith as " His Royal Highness Prince Edward " . The official address had been polished by Churchill and was moderate in tone , speaking about Edward 's inability to do his job " as I would have wished " without the support of " the woman I love " . Edward 's reign had lasted 327 days , the shortest of any British monarch since the disputed reign of Lady Jane Grey over 380 years earlier . The day following the broadcast he left Britain for Austria . 
 = = Post @-@ abdication = = 
 George VI gave his elder brother the title of Duke of Windsor with the style His Royal Highness on 12 December 1936 . On 3 May the following year , the Simpsons ' divorce was made final . The case was handled quietly and it barely featured in some newspapers . The Times printed a single sentence below a separate , and seemingly unconnected , report announcing the Duke 's departure from Austria . 
 Edward married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937 . She became the Duchess of Windsor , but , much to Edward 's disgust , King George issued letters patent that denied her the style of Her Royal Highness . The couple settled in France , and the Duke received a tax @-@ free allowance from his brother , which Edward supplemented by writing his memoirs and by illegal currency trading . He also profited from the sale of Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House to George VI . Both estates are private property and not part of the Royal Estate , and were therefore inherited and owned by Edward , regardless of the abdication . 
 In October 1937 , the Duke and Duchess visited Germany , against the advice of the British government , and met Hitler at his Obersalzberg retreat . The visit was much publicised by the German media . During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes . In an article for the New York Daily News and Chicago Tribune of 13 December 1966 the Duke wrote that in 1937 Hitler persuaded him " it was in Britain 's interest and in Europe 's too , that Germany be encouraged to strike east and smash Communism forever ... I thought the rest of us could be fence @-@ sitters while the Nazis and the Reds slogged it out . " 
 After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , Edward was assigned to the British Military Mission in France . In February 1940 , the German ambassador in The Hague , Count Julius von Zech @-@ <unk> , claimed that Edward had leaked the Allied war plans for the defence of Belgium . When Germany invaded the north of France in May 1940 , the Duke and Duchess fled to Lisbon . 
 Under the code name Operation Willi , Nazi agents , principally Walter Schellenberg , plotted unsuccessfully to persuade the Duke to leave Portugal , and contemplated kidnapping him . Lord Caldecote warned Churchill that the Duke " is well @-@ known to be pro @-@ Nazi and he may become a centre of intrigue " . Churchill threatened the Duke with a court @-@ martial if he did not return to British soil . 
 In July 1940 , Edward was appointed Governor of the Bahamas . Edward reportedly told an acquaintance , " After the war is over and Hitler will crush the Americans ... we 'll take over ... They [ the British ] don 't want me as their king , but I 'll be back as their leader . " He was reported as saying that " it would be a tragic thing for the world if Hitler was overthrown " . Comments like these reinforced the belief that the Duke and Duchess held Nazi sympathies and the effect of the abdication crisis of 1936 was to force off the throne a man with extreme political opinions . Claims that Edward would have been a threat or that he was removed by a political conspiracy to dethrone him remain speculative and " persist largely because since 1936 the contemporary public considerations have lost most of their force and so seem , wrongly , to provide insufficient explanation for the King 's departure " .

 Rogers Clark Ballard Morton ( September 19 , 1914 – April 19 , 1979 ) was an American politician who served as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Commerce during the administrations of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford , Jr . , respectively . He also served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland . 
 Though he was born in Louisville , Kentucky , Morton moved to a farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s . In 1962 , he was elected to the House of Representatives , in which capacity he established an environmental record . Morton would joke that his two middle initials stood for " Chesapeake Bay . " In 1968 , Morton played a major role in Richard Nixon 's campaign for president , and was chosen by Nixon in 1969 to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee . 
 In the elections of 1970 , Morton was considered a strong candidate to challenge Joseph Tydings for his U.S. Senate seat from Maryland , but he chose instead to remain as chairman of the RNC . In 1971 , President Nixon tapped Morton to serve as Secretary of the Interior , during which time he oversaw the construction of the Trans @-@ Alaska Pipeline System and the 1973 oil crisis . Morton was the only person from the East Coast to serve as head of the Interior Department in the 20th century . 
 Following Nixon 's resignation due to the Watergate Scandal , Morton continued in his post in the Gerald Ford administration until 1975 , when he was nominated to serve as Secretary of Commerce . From April to August 1976 , Morton served as Ford 's campaign manager in his bid for election . Morton retired from politics following Ford 's election defeat . Three years later , he died of cancer at his home in Easton on the Eastern Shore of Maryland . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Morton was born in Louisville , the son of David Clark Morton , a physician , and his wife , Mary Harris Ballard Morton , an heiress to a flour milling business . He was related to George Rogers Clark , a military officer who served during the American Revolutionary War . Morton was one of three children ; his brother Thruston B. Morton also had a career in politics , serving as chairman of the Republican National Committee and representing Kentucky in both the United States House of Representatives and then the United States Senate . 
 Morton received his early education from the Woodberry Forest School near Orange , Virginia , and in 1937 graduated from Yale University , where he was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity ( Phi chapter ) . Like his father , Morton worked to become a physician and entered the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons . However , he dropped out after only one year . In 1939 , Morton married the former Anne Jones . They had two children , David Clark and Anne Morton . 
 In 1938 , Morton was commissioned in the United States Navy but only served for a short time due to problems with his back . Afterwards , he entered his family 's flour business , Ballard & Ballard . In 1941 , at the outset of World War II , Morton enlisted in the Armored Field Artillery of the United States Army as a private and served in the European Theater . He received a commission during the war and left the army as a captain in 1945 . 
 After the war , Morton returned to the family business , where he served as president from 1947 to 1951 . In 1952 , the business was merged into the Pillsbury Flour Company , where Morton went on to serve as a director and a member of the executive committee for several more years . 
 = = Congressional career = = 
 In 1947 , Morton spent a great deal of time helping his brother Thruston in his ultimately successful campaign for election to the House of Representatives in Kentucky . After this initial exposure to politics , Morton moved to the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the early 1950s , where he set up a 1 @,@ 400 acres ( 5 @.@ 7 km2 ) cattle farm along the Wye River in Talbot County . In 1962 , Morton decided to challenge Democratic incumbent Thomas Francis Johnson of Maryland 's 1st congressional district . Johnson , who was reeling from a political scandal , lost to Morton in the general election . Morton was lauded for not making Johnson 's legal troubles his primary campaign issue . 
 Morton was re @-@ elected to Congress four more times , and served from 1963 until 1971 . In Congress , Morton worked to enact legislation that would preserve the Chesapeake Bay , including laws reducing pollution into the Bay , working for the creation of a national park on Assateague Island , and providing funds to the Army Corps of Engineers to model how the Bay functions as an estuary . Concerning civil rights , Morton voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , but not the Act of 1968 . 
 During the 1968 Republican National Convention , Morton served as the floor manager for eventual presidential nominee Richard Nixon . Morton also delivered the speech nominating Spiro Agnew , then @-@ Governor of Maryland , as the vice presidential candidate . 
 Due to his role in Nixon 's election campaign and his environmental advocacy , Morton expected to be appointed as Secretary of the Interior in 1969 . However , he was passed over for the position in favor of a westerner . He had also been considered for Nixon 's vice presidential running mate , but lost out to Agnew . In January 1969 , to recognize his efforts , Nixon appointed Morton as chairman of the Republican National Committee . 
 = = 1970 United States Senate election = = 
 In 1969 , leading up to the 1970 elections , Morton was considered one of the strongest potential candidates to challenge incumbent Democratic senator Joseph Tydings . Morton had sought the Republican nomination for Maryland 's other U.S. Senate seat in the 1968 elections , but bowed out in favor of Charles Mathias , Jr. to prevent a primary battle . 
 Speculation that Morton would seek election to Tydings ' seat increased after an editorial in the Baltimore Sun encouraged him to challenge Tydings . Sources within the administration of Vice President Spiro Agnew , who was formerly governor of Maryland , were also commenting that Morton would make a strong candidate and would likely run . When Morton stated he would be making an important announcement with President Nixon in December 1969 , it seemed all but certain at the time that it would be to declare his candidacy . 
 However , Republicans around the country were concerned that Morton , who had just been appointed chairman of the RNC in January 1969 , would resign during the election season to better handle the battle with Tydings . President Nixon shared their concerns , and encouraged Morton to remain as chairman . On December 16 , 1969 , with Nixon by his side , Morton announced that his priorities were with the national committee , and that he would not seek Tydings ' seat . Morton also threw his full support for the nomination behind J. Glenn Beall , Jr . , a freshman member of the Maryland Senate . 
 Morton 's decision not to challenge Tydings initially worried Maryland Republicans , who saw Morton as one of their best candidates . National Republican strategists had also begun to write off Tydings ' seat as unwinnable for the 1970 election because of Tydings 's wealth and popularity in the dense urban areas of Montgomery County and Baltimore . However , despite initial misgivings by state republicans , Beall defeated Tydings on November 3 , 1970 , by a margin of more than 30 @,@ 000 votes . 
 = = Secretary of the Interior = = 
 Morton continued to serve in the House and as chairman of the RNC until 1971 , when he was nominated to be Secretary of the Interior by President Nixon . He was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate Subcommittee on the Interior , though some concerns regarding Morton 's record of environmental protection were raised by Phillip Berry , then @-@ President of the Sierra Club . Morton 's predecessor , Walter Joseph Hickel , had been chosen over Morton to fill the job in 1969 , but was fired by Nixon in late 1970 for criticizing White House policy . Morton was the only person from the east coast to serve as Interior Secretary in the 20th century . 
 Upon assuming the office of Secretary of the Interior , Morton promised he would seek to " purify the environment " . However , as his tenure progressed , he was gradually isolated from the proceedings of the White House and lost several major divisions to other departments . During the 1973 oil crisis , for example , the oil and natural gas divisions of the department were transferred to the Office of Emergency Preparedness . Furthermore , though Morton was the one who announced the construction of the Trans @-@ Alaska Pipeline System , speculation was put forward that he did not play a major role in determining its route . On August 1 , 1974 , Morton approved Anza @-@ Borrego State Park for inclusion in the national registry of natural landmarks . 
 As he was leaving his post in 1975 , further criticism was directed at Morton for his overseeing the partial dismantling of the Interior Department . He was also criticized for lacking the vigor necessary to serve as head of a cabinet department , and for failing to see through the proposed creation of a new , stronger cabinet department that would have replaced the Interior . 
 = = Later years and the Ford Administration = = 
 Following the resignation of President Nixon in the Watergate scandal , Morton continued in his position as Secretary of the Interior in the administration of President Gerald Ford . In March 1975 , while still serving as the head of the Interior Department , Morton was nominated by Ford to serve as the next Secretary of Commerce . Ford cited Morton 's extensive business experience as the primary factor for selecting him and expressed the hope that Morton would be able to " encourage American business to expand energy development and conservation efforts " . 
 In January 1976 , Ford announced Morton would be resigning as Commerce Secretary , and would serve as " special counsellor to the President " , with cabinet @-@ rank . Morton 's new position was to advise the president on domestic and economic policy . In addition , Morton was to serve as the special liaison to the political committee to elect President Ford . Morton 's duties blurred the line between his public and political duties , and caused controversy concerning how Morton would divide his time between the White House and Ford 's election campaign , and how much of his salary would be supplied by taxpayers versus the Ford election committee . In rebuttal , Morton stated " you can 't separate government from politics " , and that Presidential aides should be allowed to offer political advice . 
 In April 1976 , Morton was named campaign manager for President Ford leading up to the 1976 presidential election . He replaced former U.S. Representative Howard Callaway of Georgia , who was forced to resign following allegations of improper use of authority while he was Secretary of the Army . Morton directed Ford 's campaign until August 25 , 1976 , when he was reassigned as chairman of a steering committee and was replaced by James Baker of Houston , Texas . Morton 's demotion was at his own request ; he said that he no longer wished to bear " the responsibility and accountability of the chairmanship " . However , former Nixon aide Harry S. Dent , Sr. , of South Carolina claimed that Ford had relieved Morton as campaign manager because of a remark that Morton had made about the need for the GOP to " write off the Cotton South " in formulating the general election strategy against Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter , the former governor of Georgia who unseated President Ford . 
 After the 1976 campaign , Morton retired from politics to his farm , " Presqu <unk> " , near Easton , Maryland , where he operated a boat construction business . 
 Morton had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1973 , but he said that the disease was in its early phase and was still treatable . In 1979 , however , Morton died of the cancer at his home in Easton . He is interred in Old Wye Cemetery in Wye Mills , Maryland .

 = = = Casting and characterisation = = = 
 Stenson originally auditioned to play a friend of the established character Zara Morgan ( Kelly Greenwood ) . Although unsuccessful , the Hollyoaks casting team later asked her to apply for the new role of Steph Cunningham , and placed her straight into the final stage of auditions . She was delighted to subsequently be given the part , which was her first major television role . Stenson joined the cast straight after leaving high school , aged seventeen . She made her first appearance in March 2000 , and by 2007 had become the longest @-@ serving female cast member remaining . 
 Steph was introduced as a friend of Zara 's , who was initially " quite naive " and easily led . Within two years , her personality had altered greatly . Steph became a bully , and " a bit of a bitch " . Stenson enjoyed this transformation into a villain , as she believed it made Steph a more memorable character . She also felt she could " really go somewhere " with Steph 's bitchiness in her acting , but in contrast struggled to portray her more genuine moments . She commented that Steph is the type of character only to cry over things she " really cares about " . Stenson found this difficult to relate to , and struggled to " find a balance between pushing it too far and far enough " . She ultimately preferred to play her as a bitch , though one " more comical rather than just out @-@ and @-@ out nasty . " 
 Stenson assessed that Steph " really isn 't all bad , more of a lovable rogue who just likes making mischief for attention . " She deemed her character " very unpredictable " , with a great deal of confidence . The LINC Online called her a " beautiful blonde wild child with a penchant for arrogance and displays of egotism " . Sarah Moolla of The People branded her " superficial " , the Daily Record 's Merle Brown referred to her as " a true red @-@ blooded female , and Emma Johnson of the Liverpool Echo assessed that she had a " couldn 't @-@ care @-@ less " attitude . BBC America described Steph as a two @-@ sided character . They observed that as well as a bitch , she could be " dishonest , vain , jealous and small @-@ minded " , and wrote " She causes trouble when she wants to and will happily lie and gossip to get her own way . " Conversely , they noted that for those on her good side , " She can be your best friend , a confidante and sweet natured girl " . 
 As Steph developed , she was revealed to have a " softer side " . Beneath her tough façade was a " deeply insecure little girl who crave [ d ] love and affection . " An " artistic and creative " streak lead her to attend performing arts college , and attain a degree in drama . This inspired a rivalry with fellow actor Summer Shaw ( Summer Strallen ) , which saw Steph " determined to keep the limelight on her . " Nadia Mendoza of The Sun described Steph as Hollyoaks 's " resident drama queen " , explaining that Steph 's dislike of Summer stemmed from the fact she had previously been the only actress in the village . Stenson downplayed her vocal ability , and opined that Steph is " hardly the world 's best singer " . 
 = = = Family and relationships = = = 
 In late @-@ 2002 , more than two years after Steph 's arrival , her family were introduced to the series . The dynamics of the Dean family evolved with time . They were initially a dysfunctional unit , but in a different way to other Hollyoaks families , as they tended to disrupt the lives of others whilst being happy amongst themselves . Upon their arrival , actress Helen Pearson , who plays mother Frankie Dean , assessed that they were " really supportive of each other " , and " quite solid , like an old @-@ fashioned family unit " , despite their lack of finances which required them to undertake " various scams to keep body and soul together . " As time went on , the Deans were affected by affairs and parental separation , more typical of the soap 's other families . 
 Steph had several romances throughout her time in the series . In her early years , Stenson played her as a flirt , who acted out for the attention of boys . Her first lovers included Christian virgin Brian Drake ( Jonathan Le <unk> ) and football playing " lothario " Scott Anderson ( Daniel Hyde ) . Her later relationship with Cameron Clark ( Ben Gerrard ) had " ups and downs " due to his obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder . To boost his confidence she forced him to join a rock band . Her actions were successful , and Stenson said Steph was " proud " of this . She sacrificed their relationship so Cameron could leave and tour Europe . Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap praised Steph for being so supportive , despite Cameron 's " erratic behaviour " . 
 Steph appeared to " finally [ find ] happiness " when she fell in love with Max Cunningham ( Matt Littler ) . Although attracted to her , Max initially resisted Steph as he believed her to be a " ditzy , air @-@ headed blonde " , only interested in " bad boys . " When his younger brother Tom ( Ellis Hollins ) developed a crush on her , the " kind , sensitive way " Steph handled it altered his impression . Littler explained , " Max begins to realise there 's more to her than her looks . He begins to think she 's actually really nice and they become friends . " Littler quit the series in 2008 , and producers planned his exit around Max 's wedding to Steph . He was killed off on their wedding day , as he pulled Tom out of the path of a car . Before she filmed the aftermath of Max 's death , Stenson listened to depressing music to reach her character 's bereaved mindset . Stenson believed it was a mistake to kill Max off , and " such an awful thing to happen to Steph " , until she received " amazing feedback " about the storyline . In the aftermath , Tom asked Steph to be his mother , in a scene that then @-@ executive producer Bryan Kirkwood deemed his favourite of the year . The interaction between the two was intended to represent " what Hollyoaks is all about - lots of heart , relationships , friendships , love and loss . " Kirkwood praised Stenson 's performance throughout the storyline , particularly during in that scene . 
 Steph has a brief fling with Niall Rafferty ( Barry Sloane ) . The actors were required to film " steamy scenes " . Stenson felt it a " hard challenge " to portray , she had to convince the audience that Steph would genuinely get together with her husband 's killer . Some viewers , including all the staff of Inside Soap believed their chemistry to be greater . Stenson ultimately decided Steph was " better suited " to Max . She hoped that Steph would have even " more drama around the corner " along with " a bit of comic relief " . 
 = = = Illnesses = = = 
 = = = = Epilepsy = = = = 
 In a storyline which Stenson found challenging to portray , Steph was diagnosed with epilepsy . Feeling a responsibility to members of the viewing public who have the disorder , the actress researched it extensively , assisted by Mersey Television . As well as reading about it , she visited several organisations , and spent a day on set with a teenage girl — close in age to Steph — who has the condition , and who shared insights on the experiences she had been through . The actress felt trepidation about acting out seizures , but for her first one was assisted by the episode 's director , who had witnessed seizures first @-@ hand , having once worked in a hospital . Stenson felt privileged to be chosen for the storyline , particularly as epilepsy is typically a taboo subject which had not featured prominently in a soap opera before . 
 Barbara Pinder of Epilepsy Action praised the serial for taking on the subject matter . Hollyoaks researchers contacted the charity when developing the storyline , and Pinder felt that the show succeeded in communicating the impact of Steph 's diagnosis . She stated , " It is great to see a soap opera , specially one that is watched mainly by young people , look at the issue of epilepsy as it often gets ignored . " Stenson was pleased the storyline was " reaching out to people " , and stated that she had received many letters from fans thanking her for highlighting an under @-@ exposed subject , as well as positive feedback on the Hollyoaks website . 
 Steph initially reacted angrily towards her diagnosis , which Pinder confirmed was not uncommon , explaining : " The character is going through stages that someone with epilepsy is likely to go through . Teenagers can have terrible trouble coming to terms with epilepsy at a time when they have a lot of other difficult things to deal with . It can also be quite a blow to their independence . " Writing for the Sunday Mail , Steve Hendry assessed that the plot would serve to " bring the arrogant and often spiteful Steph down a peg or two " , humbling her . Stenson agreed that Steph 's epilepsy would make her " more understanding " , inspiring thoughtfulness towards others , as opposed to her former rejection of those different to her . However , she observed that the condition may also serve to worsen her behaviour towards " a chosen few . " The character 's epilepsy was further explored in the Hollyoaks spin @-@ off In Too Deep , in which Steph has a seizure and believes she is possessed by a spirit , almost causing her to drown . 
 = = = = Cervical cancer = = = = 
 In 2010 , Steph was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent a hysterectomy . The plot was said to echo the true story of former Big Brother contestant Jade Goody , who died of cervical cancer in 2009 . It was devised prior to the appointment of Paul Marquess as executive producer . He chose to continue with it , deciding that it would be interesting to give Steph another serious storyline , and have a character that viewers " know and love going through a really hard time . " In preparation for the storyline , Stenson studied the illness to give her a time @-@ line of the experiences Steph would undergo . She chose not to speak with any cancer patients about coping with cancer , believing that everyone handles it in their own personal way . Additionally , she aimed to make Steph 's realisation of her cancer as believable as possible , explaining that : " Steph wouldn 't have any prior knowledge about what to expect , and I wanted to see it fresh through her eyes " . She was flattered to be trusted with the storyline , and found it particularly important to get her portrayal right as , during the previous year , she had fronted the Arm Against Cervical Cancer campaign . 
 The producers aimed to send a message of early detection to the series ' young audience , and had Steph initially ignore her symptoms . Stenson hoped to raise awareness of cervical cancer , and educate women about the importance of regular smear tests . She stated that Steph was confident about beating her illness , as " the alternative [ wa ] sn 't worth thinking about . " The character was originally reluctant to tell her family about the cancer for fear of hurting them , and was embarrassed to tell her love interest Gilly Roach ( Anthony Quinlan ) , not wanting him to have to look after her . As the storyline developed , Steph cancelled her wedding to Gilly due to his refusal to accept that her condition was terminal . Quinlan explained that his character impeded her ability to deal with the situation , with his disbelief contrasting Steph 's attempt to " take this in her stride and [ ... ] spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes . " 
 Marquess deemed the storyline as a whole one which could only be depicted the way it was in Hollyoaks , aiming to tell a " tragic story " with a " sweet and humorous tone " . " A comedy element of the storyline had Steph use her cancer as a sob story to enter a talent show , recruiting orphan Tom to take to the stage with her , giving her story further emotional impact . Stenson commented , " Deep down she knows she 's not a fantastic singer , but she thought the judges would feel sorry for her and put her through . " According to Quinlan , viewer feedback on the storyline was " brilliant " . He stated that viewers were upset by Steph 's illness , and that it had even brought his own mother to tears . 
 = = = Departure = = = 
 In 2010 , it was announced that Stenson had decided to quit the serial to pursue a career in musical theatre . She deemed it " one of the most difficult decisions [ she had ] ever made " , stating that Hollyoaks had been her " dream job " and that she would miss her friends in the cast and crew . She made the decision to resign around June 2009 , but was convinced by then @-@ producer Lucy Allan to play out a long exit storyline , which concluded filming in September 2010 . Before filming her final scenes , Stenson secured her first West End role . Though she had previously felt ready to leave the series , when the time came , she was upset because she felt the reality of it . She called her final scenes " really sad and emotional " , and stated that while she had not had any input in Steph 's exit , she was happy with it . 
 Hollyoaks devised an arson plot to begin on Guy Fawkes Night 2010 , as a result of which some characters would die . The production team intended to keep details of who would die secret until transmission . Prior to broadcast , Stenson revealed that Steph would risk her own life to save Amy Barnes ( Ashley Slanina @-@ Davies ) , Leah Barnes ( Jessica Croft @-@ Lane ) and Lucas Hay . The actress explained that " She stares death in the face every day because of her cancer , so thinks she really has nothing to lose now . " Stenson performed one of her own stunts during filming , with the rest undertaken by a stunt double . A promotional trailer for the episodes aired across the Channel 4 network , featuring Steph on fire . In the event , Steph rescued Amy and her children from a burning building but refused to leave herself , saying she was ready to die . Her exit received a positive reaction from fans on the social networking website Twitter , with Stenson stating that she was " honoured " by the response . Steph 's legacy continued following her death , with her husband , family and friends left to come to terms with their grief . On 29 November 2011 it was confirmed Stenson was to reprise the role for a one off guest appearance as Steph in which she appears as an angel to Doug Carter who had attempted suicide and she convinces him that his life matters . Steph tells Doug something and he shows Frankie a special song that Steph had recorded for her . Frankie , overjoyed that her daughter had not forgotten her , wept whilst Angel Steph looked on happily and placed a hand on her shoulder before winking to Tom and returning to heaven , stating she was " ready for her solo . "

 Stenson received several award nominations for her portrayal of Steph . She was nominated in the " Best Comedy Performance " category at the 2005 and 2006 British Soap Awards , and for " Best Dramatic Performance " in 2009 . She received a long @-@ list nomination for the " Best Actress " accolade at the 2005 National Television Awards . In 2008 , Stenson was nominated for the " Sexiest Female " Inside Soap Award , which she found flattering . A further nomination in the same category followed in 2010 , accompanied by nominations for " Best Actress " , and " Best Dramatic Performance " for Steph learning she had cancer . The character was selected as one of the " top 100 British soap characters " by industry experts for a poll to be run by What 's on TV , with readers able to vote for their favourite character to discover " Who is Soap 's greatest Legend ? " 
 Following her departure , her co @-@ stars commented favourably on the actress and character , with Jorgie Porter deeming her an " ultimate original " , Gemma Merna stating that she " was Hollyoaks " , and Ricky Whittle admitting that he cried during the airing of her final scenes . Television and entertainment website Holy Soap did not see Steph 's fire death coming , calling her actions brave and her ten @-@ year duration " mammoth " . They described her most memorable moment as telling Niall she did not love him and then watching him commit suicide . Inside Soap said if there was an award for " the unluckiest character in soap " , Steph would certainly win . In his column for The Guardian , television critic Jim Shelley stated that it was time for Steph to go , having " suffered enough " during her tenure . <unk> recapping her ten years in Hollyoaks , Shelley wrote : 
 Sarah Welsh of the South Wales Echo gave the stalking storyline a negative review . She called both plot and acting " ridiculous " and commented that while she often felt sorry for the serial being snubbed at the National Soap Awards , " This is not the way to raise the game . " 
 Steph 's relationships were a focal point of many reviews . The Daily Mirror 's Nicola Methven and Polly Hudson found a 2004 love triangle between Steph , her sister Debbie and love interest Dan Hunter ( Andrew McNair ) " surprising compelling " . Grace Dent of The Guardian observed of her failed engagement to Fernando : " With the best will in the world , I don 't feel that marriage was ever going to last " . Dent had previously named Steph singing the Sugababes ' " About You Now " at Max 's funeral one of her four favourite soap moments of 2008 . Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury felt there was " plenty of chemistry " between Steph and Gilly . Their relationship was frequently commented on by the Daily Mail 's Jaci Stephen in her weekly soap column . She expressed disinterest in Steph and Cheryl 's rivalry over Gilly , and found it implausible that she and Jem would quarrel over him . When the two finally admitted their feelings for one another in May 2010 , Stephen accurately predicted that their happiness would be short @-@ lived . She highlighted a lack of subtlety in the scripting of the lead @-@ up to their wedding , observing : " Of course , you know that the moment she says that nothing is going to stop her marrying Gilly , the Grim Reaper will be pulling up in his hearse , shortly behind the wedding car . " 
 Stephen derided Steph 's singing ambition during her X Factor plot line , deeming her voice " average " and writing that she did not need to use her cancer for the sympathy vote , as her singing alone would be enough for that . She later questioned when Steph would accept that she was not intended to be a singer , commenting that her " ambition could not be made of sterner stuff " , but that Simon Cowell and the remainder of the population would breathe " a major sigh of relief " at the abandonment of her showbiz dreams . More positively , Stephen wrote that she loved the bravery in " both the humour and pathos that Steph 's manipulation of her cancer brings . " 
 Reviewing the Steph @-@ centric spin @-@ off In Too Deep for The Times , Tim Teeman commented that while late @-@ night Hollyoaks episodes had previously been amusing , " sexed @-@ up " versions of the main show , with In Too Deep it became " less <unk> , more What Lies Beneath " . The episode was selected as recommended viewing by Laws of the Sunday Mercury . The launch of Hollyoaks Later series one , in which Niall returns to target Steph , was named a " Satellite Pick of the Day " by the Daily Record . Christopher Howse , writing " <unk> " for The Daily Telegraph — a column chronicling tabloid culture — named Steph and her family joint tenth in a list of Top Ten Deans , which included entrants such as Dean Koontz , Dean Gaffney and Richard Dean Anderson . 
 = Battle of Tabsor = 
 The Battle of Tabsor was fought on 19 – 20 September 1918 beginning the Battle of Sharon , which along with the Battle of Nablus formed the set piece Battle of Megiddo fought between 19 and 25 September in the last months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War . During the infantry phase of the Battle of Sharon the British Empire 60th Division , XXI Corps attacked and captured the section of the front line nearest the Mediterranean coast under cover of an intense artillery barrage including a creeping barrage and naval gunfire . This Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) victory over the entrenched Ottoman Eighth Army , composed of German and Ottoman soldiers , began the Final Offensive , ultimately resulting in the destruction of the equivalent of one Ottoman army , the retreat of what remained of two others , and the capture of many thousands of prisoners and many miles of territory from the Judean Hills to the border of modern @-@ day Turkey . After the end of the battle of Megiddo , the Desert Mounted Corps pursued the retreating soldiers to Damascus , six days later . By the time the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire five weeks later , Aleppo had been captured . 
 During the Battle of Tabsor the 3rd ( Lahore ) , 7th ( Meerut ) and 75th Divisions attacked the entrenched Ottoman Empire Eighth Army defending the Tabsor defences . These defences were located in the middle section of the front line , assigned to the XXI Corps . On their left the Battle of Tulkarm was being fought with the Battle of Arara fought on their right . Together with the cavalry phase , these battles make up the Battle of Sharon , which , with the Battle of Nablus , fought by the XX Corps and Chaytor 's Force , have become known as the Battle of Megiddo . Megiddo developed into a major set piece offensive , when large formations of the Allied EEF , attacked and responded to the reactions of three Ottoman armies , each time following a predetermined plan . The offensive resulted in defeat for Ottoman forces in Palestine , Syria and the Transjordan . 
 These operations began the Final Offensive , ultimately resulting in the destruction of the equivalent of an Ottoman army and the retreat in disarray of what remained of two armies . The defeat of the Yildirim Army Group , commanded by Otto Liman von Sanders , resulted in the capture of many thousands of prisoners and many miles of territory stretching from the Judean Hills . After the battle of Megiddo , Desert Mounted Corps pursued the retreating German and Ottoman soldiers to Damascus , which was captured six days later , when the pursuit continued on to close to the border of modern @-@ day Turkey . Five weeks after the Final Offensive began and with Aleppo captured , the Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire ending the fighting in this theatre . 
 The Battle of Tabsor began with an intense creeping bombardment , during which three infantry divisions of the XXI Corps attacked the Tabsor defences ; the only continuous trench @-@ and @-@ redoubt system on the Ottoman front line . As they advanced , their left flank was protected by the 60th Division , which advanced up the coast to the Nahr el Faliq , before capturing Tulkarm , the headquarters of the Eighth Army . Their right flank was secured by the 54th ( East Anglian ) Division , with the Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie pivoting on the Rafat salient . Defending the Ottoman front line against the attacks by the 3rd ( Lahore ) , 7th ( Meerut ) and 75th Divisions were four divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army : the 7th , 20th and 46th Infantry Divisions of the Ottoman XXII Corps and the 19th Division of the German Asia Corps . By the end of the first day of battle , the Ottoman 7th Division had ceased to exist and the Ottoman front line ( which had previously stretched east @-@ west from the coast ) had been pushed and bent back to run north @-@ south . The Seventh Army , further inland , was forced to withdraw when the Eighth Army was outflanked , to conform with the new Ottoman front line . 
 = = Background = = 
 By July , it was clear that the German Spring Offensive in France , which had forced the postponement of offensive plans in Palestine , had failed , resulting in a return to trench warfare on the Western Front . This coincided with the approach of the campaign season in Palestine and the Middle East . General Edmund Allenby , commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) , was " very anxious to make a move in September " , when he expected to capture the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Army headquarters at Tulkarm and Nablus , the road to Jisr ed Damieh and Es Salt in the hills east of the Jordan River . " Another reason for moving to this line is that it will encourage both my own new Indian troops and my Arab Allies . "

 After the 52nd ( Lowland ) , the 74th ( Yeomanry ) Divisions and nine British infantry battalions from each of the 10th , 53rd , 60th and 75th Divisions were sent to France between May and August 1918 , the remaining British infantry battalions were reinforced by British Indian Army battalions . Infantry brigades were now reorganised with one British battalion and three British Indian Army battalions , with the exception of one brigade in the 53rd Division which had one South African and three Indian battalions . The British Indian Army 's 7th ( Meerut ) Division arrived from the campaign in Mesopotamia in January 1918 , followed by the 3rd ( Lahore ) Division in April 1918 . Only the 54th ( East Anglian ) Division remained , as previously , an all British division . 
 By April 1918 , 35 infantry and two pioneer battalions were being prepared to move to Palestine . Those battalions with identification numbers from 150 upwards were formed by removing complete companies from experienced regiments then serving in Mesopotamia and forming new battalions . The 2 / 151st Indian Infantry was one such battalion formed from one company each from the 56th Punjabi Rifles and the 51st , 52nd and 53rd Sikhs . One regiment , the 101st Grenadiers , formed a second battalion by dividing itself into two with two experienced and two new companies in each battalion . The parent battalions also supplied first line transport and experienced officers with war time service . The 3 / 151st Indian Infantry had the commanding officer , two other British and four Indian officers included in the 198 men transferred from the 38th Dogras . The sepoys transferred were also very experienced . In September 1918 the 2 / 151st Indian Infantry had to provide an honour guard for Allenby ; among the men on parade were some who had served on five different fronts since 1914 , and on eight pre @-@ war campaigns . 
 Of the 54 Indian battalions deployed to Palestine , 22 had recent experience of combat , but had each lost an experienced company , which had been replaced by recruits . Ten battalions were formed from experienced troops who had never fought or trained together . The other 22 had not seen any prior service in the war ; in total , almost a third of the troops were recruits . Within 44 Indian battalions , the " junior British officers were green , and most could not speak Hindustani . In one battalion only one Indian officer spoke English and only two British officers could communicate with their men . " Not all of the Indian battalions served in the infantry divisions , some were employed in defence of the lines of communication .

From the Judean Hills the front line fell steeply to 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) below sea level in the Jordan Valley , where it continued for about 18 miles ( 29 km ) to the Dead Sea and the foothills of the Mountains of Gilead / Moab .

 = = = British plans and preparations = = = 
 On the first quarter of the front line , which stretched 15 miles ( 24 km ) across the Plain of Sharon from the Mediterranean Sea , the XXI Corps deployed 35 @,@ 000 infantry , the Desert Mounted Corps 9 @,@ 000 cavalry and the artillery 's 383 guns for their attacks on the Eighth Army . On the remaining three quarters of front line , ending at the Dead Sea , 22 @,@ 000 infantry , 3 @,@ 000 cavalry and 157 guns of the XX Corps and Chaytor 's Force were deployed facing the Ottoman Seventh and Fourth Armies . 
 The Battle of Sharon was to begin with an attack on an 8 @-@ mile ( 13 km ) -long stretch of front line between the Jaffa @-@ Jerusalem railway running north from Lydda towards Tulkarm ( cut at the front line ) and the Mediterranean , where Allenby massed three mounted divisions behind three of the XXI Corps ' infantry divisions supported by 18 densely deployed heavy and siege batteries . Together the five infantry divisions of the XXI Corps , commanded by the British Lieutenant General Sir Edward Bulfin , had an advantage of 4 @.@ 4 – to – 1 in total numbers , and three times the defenders ' heavy artillery . " Concentration , surprise and speed were key elements in the blitzkrieg warfare planned by Allenby . " 
 The four infantry divisions of the XXI Corps were to begin the Battle of Sharon by attacking in overwhelming strength , supported by the greatest possible weight of artillery . The first objective of breaking the German and Ottoman front line was assigned to the 60th Division . They were to create a gap sufficiently large to enable the cavalry to safely advance to the rear of the German and Ottoman forces in the Judean Hills . The second objective of assaulting the Tabsor defences was assigned to the 3rd ( Lahore ) , 7th ( Meerut ) and 75th Divisions . After their successful initial attack they were to attack the <unk> Kalkilieh @-@ Et Tire line . 
 After the cavalry breakthrough on the coast , the XXI Corps would advance to capture the headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm and cut the railway lines . Sections of the lateral rail line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus and a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway , were to be denied to the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies . These lines , including the important railway junction at Messudieh , transported their supplies into the Judean Hills . The British infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north – east , pivoting on their right to push the defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh . 
 While the brigades of the XXI Corps ' 3rd ( Lahore ) , the 7th ( Meerut ) and the 75th Divisions attacked the Tabsor defences , the 54th ( East Anglian ) Division and the Détachement Français de Palestine et de Syrie defended and pivoted on the Rafat salient covering the right flank . Further to the right , the XX Corps would begin the Battle of Nablus in the Judean Hills in support of the main attack by the XXI Corps , by advancing to capture the Seventh Army headquarters at Nablus and blocking the main escape route from the Judean Hills to the Jisr ed Damieh . 
 Together , these attacks would force the Central Powers to retreat back along their main line of communication on the roads and branch lines to the Jezreel Valley railway . These ran alongside each other out of the Judean Hills , through the Dothan Pass to Jenin , and across the Esdrealon Plain ( also known as the Jezreel Valley and the ancient Plain of Armageddon ) , 40 miles ( 64 km ) away , and on to Damascus . The plain was also the site of the important communication hubs at Afulah and Beisan and here thousands would be captured by the cavalry as they successfully exploited the infantry victories . The objectives of Desert Mounted Corps were the swift capture of Afulah by the 4th Cavalry Division , the swift capture the Yildirim Army Group 's headquarters at Nazareth by the 5th Cavalry Division and the swift capture of Jenin by the Australian Mounted Division 's 3rd Light Horse Brigade . Together , the occupation of the lowlands of the Plain of Sharon , the Esdrealon Plain and the southern Jordan Valley would form a semicircle round the positions of the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills . 
 = = = British Empire deployments = = = 
 The actual frontage which would be directly attacked by the British Empire infantry was about 10 miles ( 16 km ) long , but it was not continuous . There were about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of gaps in their deployment , where the terrain was unfavourable for a frontal attack . During the advance , a planned right @-@ flanking movement by all the infantry divisions aimed to bring them in touch with one another . At this point in their advance , Ottoman units in those areas unfavourable for frontal attack would be forced to withdraw by the threatening encirclement , be outflanked or be captured from the rear . 
 The final deployment , which was made during 35 minutes of darkness between moon @-@ set and dawn , placed the divisions at right angles to the direction of their advance . The XXI Corps ' 60th Division was deployed closest to the coast with the 7th ( Meerut ) Division on their right and then the 75th Division with the longest frontage , followed by the 3rd ( Lahore ) Division , the 54th ( East Anglian ) Division and finally the Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie at Rafat , at the eastern end of the XXI Corps front line in the foothills of the Judean Hills . There was no corps reserve . 
 = = = German and Ottoman forces and preparations = = = 
 In August 1918 , the Central Powers ' Yildirim Army Group commanded by Otto Liman von Sanders consisted of 40 @,@ 598 front @-@ line infantrymen organised into twelve divisions defending a 56 miles ( 90 km ) long front . They were armed with 19 @,@ 819 rifles , 273 light and 696 heavy machine guns . The high number of machine guns reflects the Ottoman Army 's new tables of organization . 
 Cevat Pasha 's Eighth Army of 10 @,@ 000 soldiers , was supported by 157 guns . With its headquarters at Tulkarm , this army held a line from the Mediterranean coast just north of Arsuf to Furkhah in the Judean Hills . The Eighth Army was organised into the XXII Corps ' 7th , 20th and 46th Divisions and the Asia Corps ' 16th and 19th Divisions , three German battalion groups of the German " Pasha II " detachment , and the 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division in reserve . The German Asia Corps , also known as the " Left Wing Group " , with a high component of machine guns , was commanded by the German Colonel Gustav von Oppen . The Asia Corps linked the Eighth Army 's XXII Corps on the coast with the Seventh Army 's III Corps further inland , facing units of the British XX Corps . 
 The 7th , 19th and 20th Divisions held the shortest frontage in the entire Yildirim Army Group . The 7th and 20th Divisions together held a total of 7 @.@ 5 miles ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) of trenches . The 7th Division held 4 @.@ 3 miles ( 6 @.@ 9 km ) nearest the coast while the 20th Division held 3 @.@ 1 miles ( 5 @.@ 0 km ) and the Asia Corps ' 19th Division held 6 @.@ 2 miles ( 10 @.@ 0 km ) of trenches further inland . The 46th Division formed the reserve 7 @.@ 5 miles ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) from the front line , near the Eighth Army 's headquarters at Tulkarm . 
 These divisions were some of the most highly regarded fighting formations in the Ottoman Army ; in 1915 the 7th and 19th Divisions had fought as part of Esat Pasa 's III Corps at Gallipoli . The 20th Division had also fought towards the end of the Gallipoli campaign and served for a year in Galicia fighting against Russians on the Eastern Front . This regular army division , which had been raised and stationed in Palestine , was sometimes referred to as the Arab Division . 
 The XXII Corps was supported by the majority of the Yildirim Army 's heavy artillery for counter battery operations . Here , three of the five Ottoman Army heavy artillery batteries in Palestine ( the 72nd , 73rd and 75th Batteries ) were deployed . Further , the Ottoman front line regiments had been alerted that a major attack was imminent . 
 = = = = Other views of this force = = = = 
 The Ottoman armies were understrength , overstretched , suffering greatly from a strained supply system , overwhelmingly outnumbered by the EEF by about two to one , and " haemorrhaging " deserters . The effective strengths of the nine infantry battalions of the 16th Infantry Division were each equal to a British infantry company of between 100 and 250 men while 150 to 200 men were assigned to the 19th Infantry Division without taking into account the large number of machine guns in these Asia Corps divisions . Problems with the supply system in February 1918 resulted in the normal daily ration in Palestine being 125 grains ( 0 @.@ 29 oz ) of bread and boiled beans in the morning , at noon , and at night , without oil or any other condiment . 
 = = = Tabsor defences = = = 
 The Tabsor defences consisted of the only continuous trench and redoubt system on the front line . Here the Ottomans had dug two or three lines of trenches and redoubts , varying in depth from 1 – 3 miles ( 1 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 8 km ) . These defences centred on the village of Tabsor , and stretched from Jaljulye to the coast . Another less developed system of defences was 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) behind , and the beginnings of a third system ran from Tulkarm across the Plain of Sharon to the Nahr Iskanderun . The Ottoman armies defences were inflexible defence relying on a line of trenches which required " every inch of ground ... to be fought for when a more flexible system would have better suited the situation " . 
 On 17 September 1918 , Ottoman Army intelligence accurately placed five infantry divisions and a detachment opposite their Eighth Army . As a consequence , the 46th Infantry Division was moved up 8 @.@ 1 miles ( 13 @.@ 0 km ) to the south – west to a new reserve position at Et Tire , directly behind the Ottoman XXII Corps 's front line divisions .

 = = = = Bombardment = = = = 
 At 04 : 30 a bombardment by artillery , trench mortars and machine guns began firing at the German and Ottoman front and second lines of trenches in front of XXI Corps . This intense bombardment , which closely resembled a Western @-@ Front @-@ style bombardment , continued for a half @-@ hour , with guns deployed one to every 50 yards ( 46 m ) of front on the coastal sector . Under cover of this bombardment , the leading infantry advanced to the front line . Just before their arrival , the barrage lifted and began firing behind the Ottoman front line . There was no attempt at systematic attempt by the artillery to cut the wire ; the leading units were to cut it by hand or carry some way of crossing or bridging it . 
 The artillery was organised by weight and targets : heavy artillery was employed in counter @-@ battery fire , with guns and 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch howitzers shelling objectives beyond the range of the field artillery 's barrage and where the infantry advance was delayed . Field artillery bombarded the Ottoman front line until the infantry advance arrived ; then , the 18 @-@ pounders and Royal Horse Artillery batteries lifted to form a creeping barrage in front of the infantry up to their range . This barrage began firing at a range of 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) but by 08 : 00 it had been extended to 15 @,@ 000 yards ( 14 @,@ 000 m ) as the guns lifted and moved forward at a rate of 50 yards ( 46 m ) per minute , 75 yards ( 69 m ) per minute or 100 yards ( 91 m ) per minute in front of the three divisions ' separate and uniquely timed advances . 
 = = = = 7th ( Meerut ) Division attack western sector = = = = 
 The 7th ( Meerut ) Division , consisting of the 19th , 21st and 28th Brigades , commanded by Major General V. B. Fane , advanced under cover of the bombardment ; their creeping barrage moving forward at a rate of 100 yards ( 91 m ) per minute . They were to assault the western end of the Tabsor defences , between a wadi west of Tabsor and the Wadi <unk> el Miske , on the right of the 60th Division 's advance . Once these objectives had been captured , they were to advance and capture a second system of trenches defending Et Tire without artillery support , as the guns would be out of range and in the process of being moved forward . 
 The 7th ( Meerut ) Division 's 19th Brigade consisting of the 1st Battalion , Seaforth Highlanders , 28th Punjabis , 92nd Punjabis and 125th Napier 's Rifles , with the 1st Guides and 20th Punjabis ( 21st Brigade ) and the 134th Machine Gun Company attached , were formed into two columns in front of the British wire , each column on a frontage one battalion wide . The initial attack by the 28th and the 92nd Punjabis , under cover of the creeping barrage , was completely successful , and included the capture of a 150mm howitzer battery by five men of the 92nd Punjabis and the 1st Guides . The second attack on the Et Tire defensive line , by the 1st Battalion , Seaforth Highlanders and the 125th Napier 's Rifles , met with more opposition but was eventually successful . Subsequently , 40 men from the 125th Napier 's Rifles captured 200 soldiers and six machine guns defending the only crossing of the <unk> marshes . A second battery of 105mm howitzers behind the captured position and the trenches at Ayun el Basse , from which the German or Ottoman force had covered the <unk> crossing , was seized by the 1st Battalion , Seaforth Highlanders . 
 The remaining two battalions of the 21st Brigade , the 2nd Battalion , The Black Watch ( Royal Highlanders ) and the 1 / 8th Gurkha Rifles , captured the front @-@ line system of defences under cover of the creeping barrage , and then advanced to capture the Wadi <unk> el Miske and 350 prisoners . At 08 : 40 , the 7th ( Meerut ) Division had advanced to a position to allow the 4th Cavalry Division to advance to capture Afulah and Beisan . By 09 : 00 the 21st Brigade was in the process of reforming at ' Ayun el Basse , with the return of the 1st Guides and 20th Punjabis from the 19th Brigade . The 1st Guides had still not arrived back to the 21st Brigade when , at 13 : 00 , the brigade marched to Et Tire , which the 75th Division had captured at 11 : 00 . Here they concentrated east of the village , while the 19th Brigade also moved towards Et Tire . At 16 : 30 the 21st Brigade continued their advance eastwards across the Tulkarm road , where their 20th Punjabis were heavily machine @-@ gunned by a German battalion in the foothills of the Judean Hills . Their objective had been Felamiye , but they were stopped 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) from that village . Meanwhile , the 2nd Battalion , Royal Highlanders came up to assist the 92nd Punjabis attack ; together succeeding in the capture of El Majdal . 
 The third brigade of the 7th ( Meerut ) Division ( the 28th Brigade ) , consisting of the 2nd Battalion , Leicestershire Regiment , the 51st Sikhs , the 53rd Sikhs and the 56th Punjabi Rifles , were supported by the recently returned 264th Brigade Royal Field Artillery ( RFA ) on completion of the creeping barrage . By 12 : 30 , this brigade had reached a point north @-@ east of the <unk> marsh and had turned east to advance with its battalions in a diamond formation towards Et Taiyibe on the eastern side of the Tulkarm road . Their advance guard , the 56th Punjabi Rifles , drove in a rearguard position 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) north west of Et Tire about 15 : 30 . The survivors of this rearguard position re @-@ established themselves 1 @,@ 500 yards ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) further east on a lower ridge . This second rearguard position was captured soon after , and Taiyibe was occupied at 18 : 00 when the brigade bivouacked north @-@ east and south of the village . 
 = = = = 75th Division attack the centre = = = = 
 Comprising the 232nd , 233rd and 234th Brigades , the 75th Division advanced ( with the 233rd Brigade in reserve ) under cover of the creeping barrage which lifted at a rate of 50 yards ( 46 m ) per minute . The bombardment in front of their line was so accurate that the leading infantry units were able to keep within 40 yards ( 37 m ) of the advancing line of shells , suffering only one casualty from their own fire . 
 The 234th Brigade advanced with the leading companies of the 1 / 152nd Indian Infantry and the 58th Vaughan 's Rifles on the left . In the centre , two companies of the 1 / 5th Battalion , Somerset Light Infantry ( 233rd Brigade ) had been attached to the 234th Brigade . They formed an advance guard , to attack an isolated defensive line 600 yards ( 550 m ) in front of the main defences . The 4th Battalion , Wiltshire Regiment and the 2 / 3rd Gurkha Rifles of the 232nd Brigade advanced on the right . These units attacked under the creeping barrage and successfully captured all objectives , including the isolated Ottoman front @-@ line trenches , the main trenches and the Ottoman batteries beyond . 
 While the advance guard consolidated its capture of the isolated trench line , the two main columns , formed by the 232nd and 234th Brigades , moved on to the main defensive works in front of Et Tire . This position was defended by the Ottoman Eighth Army 's reserve division , the 46th Division commanded by Major Tiller . Here Tiller held an extensive fortified trench system surrounded by a network of cactus hedges , making a " formidable obstacle " . 
 As the 234th Brigade continued their advance with the 1 / 4th Battalion , Duke of Cornwall 's Light Infantry and the 123rd Outram 's Rifles in artillery formation , two or three Ottoman batteries in the wadi south west of Miske fired on the 1 / 152nd Indian Infantry to within 60 yards ( 55 m ) . Shortly after 08 : 00 an Indian bayonet attack captured three 150mm howitzers , seven <unk> guns and their detachments , along with the trenches defending Et Tire . 
 The 232nd Brigade ( composed of the 4th Battalion , Wiltshire Regiment , the 72nd Punjabis , the 2 / 3rd Gurkhas Rifles and the 3rd Kashmir Imperial Service Infantry ) advanced with their leading companies in line , the remainder in artillery formation : the 4th Battalion Wiltshire Regiment on the right and the 2 / 3rd Gurkha Rifles on the left . They had quickly captured the main front @-@ line trenches under the creeping barrage before advancing to capture Miske at 07 : 00 , supported by the South African Field Artillery Brigade , which had moved forward after completing its part of the creeping barrage . A firing line was established at the edge of Et Tire , after an advance of 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) by the 4th Battalion , Wiltshire Regiment , the 2 / 3rd Gurkha Rifles and the 72nd Punjabis , which had been brigade reserve . Here they were targeted by the defenders ; every exposed infantryman was shot . This stymied attack was eventually reinforced by the 232nd Brigade 's fourth battalion , the 3rd Kashmir Imperial Service Infantry , some armoured cars and a cavalry squadron , which compelled the Ottoman defenders to evacuate Et Tire by 11 : 00 when Refet Bey 's XXII Corps headquarters were captured . 
 The retiring Ottoman force was pursued by armoured cars , while the reserve 233rd Brigade , comprising the remainder of the 5th Battalion , Somerset Light Infantry , the 3 / 3rd Gurkha Rifles , the 29th Punjabis and the 2 / 154th Indian Infantry , moved forward to Miske . The 75th Division suffered 518 casualties , 352 of whom were from the 232nd Brigade .

 The objectives of the 3rd ( Lahore ) Division , consisting of the 7th , 8th and 9th Brigades , were to break through the Tabsor defences at <unk> and advance east , capturing Jaljulye and the Railway Redoubt , before advancing towards Qalqilye , Kh . <unk> Thilth , ' Azzun and Jiyus in the foothills of the Judean Hills . 
 The 9th Brigade , consisting of the 2nd Battalion , Dorsetshire Regiment , the 1 / 1st Gurkha Rifles , the 93rd Burma Infantry and the 105th Mahratta Light Infantry , began their advance at 04 : 27 , supported by a creeping barrage which lifted and moved forward at a rate of 100 yards ( 91 m ) per minute . The brigade moved via taped stretches into no man 's land , where a heavy Ottoman barrage of high explosive shells fell on them , with little rifle or machine @-@ gun fire until they approached the trenches . West of <unk> , the 105th Mahratta Light Infantry and 2nd Battalion , Dorsetshire Regiment attacked German and Ottoman infantry , which attempted to stop their advance . Between 05 : 00 and 05 : 30 , the 93rd Burma Infantry and the 1 / 1st Gurkha Rifles had advanced to cut the second trench line , running from Tabsor to Qalqilye . A threatened counter @-@ attack from the north was stopped by a detachment from the 1 / 1st Gurkha Rifles , which captured 136 prisoners and two machine guns . Due to constant cutting of the telephone lines and bombardment haze making visual signalling impossible , the commander of the 9th Brigade rode forward to assess the situation and ordered the advance to continue towards Jiyus . 
 The 9th Brigade moved eastwards , crossing the railway 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north @-@ west of Qalqilye at 09 : 00 with the 93rd Burma Infantry in the centre , the 105th Mahratta Light Infantry on their right , the 1 / 1st Gurkha Rifles on their left and the 2nd Battalion , Dorsetshire Regiment in reserve . Although the Ottoman 20th Division had been " completely overrun " , progress on the left was slowed by reserves from the Asia Corps west of ' Azzun . Jiyus was eventually captured by the 105th Mahratta Light Infantry and two companies from the 93rd Burma Infantry about nightfall , when two German officers and 18 other prisoners were captured . 
 The attack by the 8th Brigade , consisting of the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment , the 47th Sikhs , the 59th Scinde Rifles and the 2 / 124th Duchess of Connaught 's Own Baluchistan Infantry , began at 04 : 45 towards the Wadi <unk> , west of Jaljulye . The 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment at Ras el ' Ain and the 2 / 124th Baluchistan Infantry at Tell el <unk> , advanced rapidly capturing the first line of defence , between Bir Adas and the Hadrah road . A company from the Manchester Regiment advanced on both sides of the railway , eventually reaching a bridge over the Wadi <unk> west of Jaljulye . Here , they fired on the village and railway redoubt with two machine guns , while the Baluchistan Infantry advanced to occupy <unk> Adas at 07 : 15 . At 09 : 10 the 47th Sikhs reinforced the attack on the Railway Redoubt , supported by an intense five @-@ minute bombardment . Shortly afterwards , the redoubt , along with a pack gun and two machine guns , was captured by the Baluchistan Infantry . At 10 : 45 a bombardment covered the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment 's attack on Jaljulye , which was easily captured after the Ottoman defenders had quickly withdrawn , in consequence of the advance by the 7th Brigade , 3rd ( Lahore ) Division , which was threatening to cut them off . At 12 : 30 artillery fire from the IV Brigade RFA was directed on <unk> , which was captured 30 minutes later ; the 8th Brigade 's advance was resumed at 13 : 30 towards Kh . Ras et Tire and Tell <unk> . Both objectives were reached about 18 : 00 , the brigade bivouacking for the night behind strong outposts . 
 Meanwhile , the 7th Brigade advanced with the 2 / 7th Gurkha Rifles on the right , the 27th Punjabis on the left , the 1st Battalion Connaught Rangers in the left rear and the 91st Punjabis in support , under cover of the creeping barrage of heavy artillery and machine @-@ gun fire . They attacked the Ottoman front @-@ line defences , which at first were supported by high @-@ explosive Ottoman artillery fire ; the 27th Punjabis suffered more than 100 casualties in dense clouds of dust , smoke and shrapnel . Nevertheless , the brigade advanced to capture Kufr Saba at 07 : 12 and Qalqilye at 09 : 00 . By 14 : 00 the brigade was ordered to support the 8th Brigade attack on ' Azzun , but the order was not received until 15 : 30 so most of their advance was made during the night , eventually halting at 24 : 00 , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of Azzun . 
 = = = = Ottoman defenders ' reports = = = = 
 By 05 : 45 telephone communication to the Ottoman front had been cut and five minutes later all German and Ottoman reserves had been ordered forward . 
 At 08 : 50 , Cevat 's Eighth Army reported to Liman von Sanders , commander of the Yildirim Army Group at Nazareth , that its 7th Division ( not to be confused with the 7th ( Meerut ) Division ) was " out of the fight " and the 19th Division was under attack . 
 Small groups of survivors from the 7th and 20th Divisions managed to continue fighting while retiring . They formed a rear guard of 100 soldiers with 2 machine guns and 17 artillery guns from the 7th Division and 300 soldiers , while four machine guns and seven guns from the 20th Division also made a desperate attempt to hold the British Empire attack . Liman von Sanders ordered the 110th Infantry Regiment to advance from Nablus in support of the Eighth Army . These forces were to stop the EEF advance to the Tulkarm to Nablus road at the easily defended narrow , steep @-@ sided pass near ' Anebta . 
 The 19th Division was forced to retreat towards <unk> Kasim and the XXII Corps ( Eighth Army ) , threatened with encirclement , was in retreat towards Et Tire having lost most of its artillery . By 16 : 30 Cevat had been informed that Et Tire was captured and cut off from reports from his XXII Corps , he began to move his headquarters north at dusk . Cevat said , " The enemy has broken through our lines in spite of our counter – attacks ... Without assistance operations are impossible " . A remnant from the 7th Division managed to establish a temporary divisional headquarters at Mesudiye that night . 
 Liman von Sanders had no combat formations available to stop the cavalry advance up the coast , while in the Judean Hills the British Empire infantry attacks forced the Yildirim Army Group 's two armies to retire .

 General Bulfin , commanding the XXI Corps , issued orders for the continuation of the battle on 20 September . The 7th ( Meerut ) Division 's objectives were to attack and capture Deir Sheraf , Sebustiye and Burqa , while the 3rd ( Lahore ) Division 's objective was to establish a position through Beit <unk> and <unk> commanding the Nablus @-@ to @-@ Deir Sheraf road . The 7th and 3rd Divisions advanced to the northeast , through the hills towards ancient Samaria , while the 60th Division moved east from Tulkarm along the Tulkarm to Nablus road with the 5th Light Horse Brigade , still attached to the 60th Division , advancing north of Tulkarm to cut the railway line between Messudieh and Jenin . The 75th Division continued in reserve at Et Tire , where they may have been assigned the management of thousands of prisoners .

 The 7th ( Meerut ) Division advanced in two columns . The 21st Brigade , on the right , supported by a mixed field @-@ artillery brigade of two 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch howitzer and one 18 @-@ pounder batteries and a machine @-@ gun company , advanced through Felamiye and Kufr <unk> . The 19th Brigade , on the left , with the VIII Mountain Artillery Brigade and two machine @-@ gun companies followed by the 28th Brigade , moved through El Majdal and Kufr Sur . 
 The 21st Brigade advanced along a track beyond Kufr <unk> that proved impassable for the artillery , which was sent back to Et Tire , where it came under orders of the 75th Division . Meanwhile , the 19th Brigade captured a small rearguard position at Kufr Sur before advancing under fire at 11 : 00 to a point 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) from the village of Beit Lid . The brigade 's Lewis guns forced the Ottoman or German battery supporting the rearguard to withdraw , but heavy machine @-@ gun fire stopped the 125th Napier 's Rifles from crossing the gully between <unk> and Beit Lid . Without artillery support , an attack by the 1st Battalion , Seaforth Highlanders , which began at 14 : 00 , was held up by a strong rearguard position strengthened by cactus hedges 200 yards ( 180 m ) from the village ; they suffered 200 casualties during their attacks . After reinforcements from the 1st Guides ( 21st Brigade ) arrived , the attack was renewed at 16 : 20 . By 17 : 30 , a battery of the VIII Mountain Artillery Brigade was able to get into position to cover an advance by the 28th Punjabis ( 19th Brigade ) armed with grenades , which entered and cleared Beit Lid at 18 : 15 . At 21 : 30 the 28th Brigade began their advance towards Masudiye Station and Sebustiye . 
 = = = = 3rd ( Lahore ) Division = = = = 
 The 3rd ( Lahore ) Division 's 7th and 8th Brigades began their advance at 05 : 00 . The 7th Brigade 's 91st Punjabis ( Light Infantry ) began their advance towards ' Azzun , while the 8th Brigade moved along the Wadi ' Azzun . As the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment moved along the south bank , and the 47th Sikhs moved along on the north bank , with the 59th Scinde Rifles in the rear ; they quickly found themselves in a critical position . The leading battalions encountered about 200 German soldiers and 12 machine guns in a well @-@ sited rearguard position south of the wadi . Without any artillery support , an extended battle followed . The 59th Scinde Rifles were ordered to join the fight and a howitzer was rushed forward from the <unk> Battery , coming into effective action at 12 : 30 , when resistance almost immediately ceased . 
 The 7th Brigade 's 27th Punjabis followed the 91st Punjabis ( Light Infantry ) along the Wadi ' Azzun and the 91st Punjabis ( Light Infantry ) entered the village of ' Azzun at 08 : 10 where large quantities of stores were captured . The capture of ' Azzun , which had been the headquarters of the Asia Corps and the location of von Oppen 's reserves , was claimed by the 47th Sikhs ( 8th Brigade ) and the 91st Punjabis ( Light Infantry ) ( 7th Brigade ) . 
 The 8th Brigade continued their advance without interruption to <unk> , which was occupied in the evening . The 1st Battalion , Connaught Rangers ( 7th Brigade ) were ordered to pass through the 8th Brigade and capture the road junction northeast of El Funduq . Here they captured an artillery column of five field guns , horses , wagons and prisoners which had been held up by fire from the 9th Brigade . 
 The 9th Brigade made their way along the rocky Wadi Sir to <unk> , where they saw German soldiers retiring along the road to Deir Sheraf . The brigade artillery came into action against this target , initially one section and then the whole of the IX Mountain Artillery Brigade and some machine guns , completely blocking the road with smashed vehicles . The 93rd Burma Infantry reached the road 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) northeast of El Funduq at 15 : 10 , where they captured about 250 prisoners , many of them German . A company of the 2nd Battalion , Dorsetshire Regiment on the extreme left captured 151 prisoners north of Qaryat Hajja .

 By the end of 20 September , the Eighth Ottoman Army had been pushed back out of the coastal Plain of Sharon and the Desert Mounted Corps was blocking the Seventh and what remained of the Eighth Armies ' main lines of retreat northwards . The 60th Division held Tulkarm and Anebta , the 7th ( Meerut ) Division held the village of Beit Lid and controlled the crossroads at Deir Sheraf , while the 5th Light Horse Brigade had cut the Jenin railway south of Arrabe . Both the 3rd ( Lahore ) and 7th ( Meerut ) Divisions had continued to force the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies ' retreat . 
 During 19 and 20 September , the XXI Corps had destroyed the right wing of the Ottoman front line , capturing 7 @,@ 000 prisoners and 100 guns . Remnants of the Eighth Army which had escaped were captured the next day by Desert Mounted Corps at Jenin , in the Esdrealon Plain to the north of the Judean Hills . During two days of fighting the XXI Corps ' total casualties were 3 @,@ 378 , of whom 446 were killed . They captured 12 @,@ 000 prisoners , 149 guns and large quantities of ammunition and transport . With the exception of the Asia Corps , the whole Ottoman Eighth Army had been destroyed .

 The 28th Brigade , 7th ( Meerut ) Division advanced from Beit Lid at 21 : 30 on an overnight march towards Masudiye Station and Sebustiye . They arrived at the ' Anebta road near Ramin at 01 : 30 , and by 03 : 00 had advanced to capture the Masudiye Station along with an engine and 16 carriages , before continuing towards Sebustiye . During this march , a strong rearguard in the ruins of Samaria was attacked by the 51st and 53rd Sikhs . After working their way through an olive grove on the northwest side of the Central Powers ' rearguard position , they attacked from the flank , with a platoon of 51st Sikhs gaining the crest from the southwest . The garrison of 181 German ( or Ottoman ) soldiers was captured with eight light and heavy machine guns . More than 400 sick were found in a hospital nearby . 
 The 3rd ( Lahore ) Division continued its advance at 05 : 00 , meeting some opposition near Rafidia 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) west of Nablus . Here , they occupied a 5 @.@ 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) line stretching from Rafidia to 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) east of Burqa .

 The bulk of the Seventh Army had been retreating down the Wadi Fara road where guns and transport had to be abandoned when heavily bombed and machine @-@ gunned from the air . This Army then turned north at ' Ain Shible , moving towards Beisan . During the night of 20 / 21 September a long column of retiring Ottoman forces was seen moving down the road from Nablus to Beisan , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) north of Nablus . British and Australian aircraft subsequently bombed the column , at first just blocking one end of a defile , but later returning a number of times . Four hours later the area was covered with the wreckage of 90 guns , 50 lorries and more than 1 @,@ 000 other vehicles . The Ottoman 53rd Division , which had managed to get down the Wadi Fara before it was blocked by the air attack , was captured by Chaytor 's Force on 22 September during the fighting for the bridge at Jisr ed Damieh .

 During the night of 20 / 21 September Liman von Sanders had ordered the 16th and 19th Division west of Nablus , where they made contact with von Oppen 's Left Wing Force . The next morning von Oppen formed the remnants of the 702nd and 703rd Battalions into one battalion with a rifle company , a machine gun company and a trench mortar detachment , while the 701st Battalion and a cavalry squadron remained intact . At 10 : 00 , von Oppen was informed the EEF was approaching Nablus and that the Wadi Fara road was blocked . As a result , he decided to retreat via Beit Dejan 7 miles ( 11 km ) east @-@ southeast of Nablus to the Jordan at Jisr ed Damieh , but this way was also found to have been cut . Von Oppen then ordered the Asia Corps to retreat without guns or baggage via Mount Ebal when they were attacked by British Empire artillery and suffered casualties . That night , von Oppen bivouacked at Tammun with the 16th and 19th Divisions at Tubas . 
 Von Oppen was moving northwards from Tubas towards Beisan the next day , with about 700 German and 1 @,@ 300 Ottoman soldiers of the 16th and 19th Divisions , when he learned it had already been captured . He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh , where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders would order the establishment of a strong rearguard . However , Jevad , the commander of the Eighth Army , ordered him to cross the Jordan instead ; he successfully got all the Germans and some of the Ottoman soldiers across before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attack , which closed the last Jordan River gaps . Those who had not crossed were captured . 
 = Battle of the Alamo = 
 The Battle of the Alamo ( February 23 – March 6 , 1836 ) was a pivotal event in the Texas Revolution . Following a 13 @-@ day siege , Mexican troops under President General Antonio López de Santa Anna launched an assault on the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de Béxar ( modern @-@ day San Antonio ) , Texas , United States , killing all of the Texian defenders . Santa Anna 's cruelty during the battle inspired many Texians — both Texas settlers and adventurers from the United States — to join the Texian Army . Buoyed by a desire for revenge , the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto , on April 21 , 1836 , ending the revolution . 
 Several months previously , Texians had driven all Mexican troops out of Mexican Texas . About 100 Texians were then garrisoned at the Alamo . The Texian force grew slightly with the arrival of reinforcements led by eventual Alamo co @-@ commanders James Bowie and William B. Travis . On February 23 , approximately 1 @,@ 500 Mexicans marched into San Antonio de Béxar as the first step in a campaign to retake Texas . For the next 10 days the two armies engaged in several skirmishes with minimal casualties . Aware that his garrison could not withstand an attack by such a large force , Travis wrote multiple letters pleading for more men and supplies , but fewer than 100 reinforcements arrived there . 
 In the early morning hours of March 6 , the Mexican Army advanced on the Alamo . After repulsing two attacks , the Texians were unable to fend off a third attack . As Mexican soldiers scaled the walls , most of the Texian soldiers withdrew into interior buildings . Defenders unable to reach these points were slain by the Mexican cavalry as they attempted to escape . Between five and seven Texians may have surrendered ; if so , they were quickly executed . Most eyewitness accounts reported between 182 and 257 Texians died , while most historians of the Alamo agree that around 600 Mexicans were killed or wounded . Several noncombatants were sent to Gonzales to spread word of the Texian defeat . The news sparked both a strong rush to join the Texian army and a panic , known as " The Runaway Scrape " , in which the Texian army , most settlers , and the new Republic of Texas government fled from the advancing Mexican Army . 
 Within Mexico , the battle has often been overshadowed by events from the Mexican – American War of 1846 – 48 . In 19th @-@ century Texas , the Alamo complex gradually became known as a battle site rather than a former mission . The Texas Legislature purchased the land and buildings in the early part of the 20th century and designated the Alamo chapel as an official Texas State Shrine . The Alamo is now " the most popular tourist site in Texas " . The Alamo has been the subject of numerous non @-@ fiction works beginning in 1843 . Most Americans , however , are more familiar with the myths spread by many of the movie and television adaptations , including the 1950s Disney miniseries Davy Crockett and John Wayne 's 1960 film The Alamo . 
 = = Background = = 
 Under President Antonio López de Santa Anna , the Mexican government began to shift away from a federalist model . The increasingly dictatorial policies , including the revocation of the Constitution of 1824 in early 1835 , incited many federalists to revolt . The border region of Mexican Texas was largely populated by immigrants from the United States . These people were accustomed to a federalist government and to extensive individual rights , and they were quite vocal in their displeasure at Mexico 's shift towards centralism . Already suspicious after previous American attempts to purchase Mexican Texas , Mexican authorities blamed much of the Texian unrest on American immigrants , most of whom had made little effort to adapt to the Mexican culture . 
 In October , Texians engaged Mexican troops in the first official battle of the Texas Revolution . Determined to quell the rebellion , Santa Anna began assembling a large force , the Army of Operations in Texas , to restore order . Most of his soldiers were raw recruits , and a large number had been forcibly conscripted . 
 The Texians systematically defeated the Mexican troops already stationed in Texas . The last group of Mexican soldiers in the region — commanded by Santa Anna 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , General Martín Perfecto de Cos — surrendered on December 9 following the siege of Béxar . By this point , the Texian Army was dominated by very recent arrivals to the region , primarily adventurers from the United States . Many Texas settlers , unprepared for a long campaign , had returned home . Angered by what he perceived to be American interference in Mexican affairs , Santa Anna spearheaded a resolution classifying foreigners found fighting in Texas as pirates . The resolution effectively banned the taking of prisoners of war : in this period of time , captured pirates were executed immediately . Santa Anna reiterated this message in a strongly worded letter to United States President Andrew Jackson . This letter was not widely distributed , and it is unlikely that most of the American recruits serving in the Texian Army were aware that there would be no prisoners of war . 
 When Mexican troops departed San Antonio de Béxar ( now San Antonio , Texas , USA ) Texian soldiers established a garrison at the Alamo Mission , a former Spanish religious outpost which had been converted to a makeshift fort by the recently expelled Mexican Army . Described by Santa Anna as an " irregular fortification hardly worthy of the name " , the Alamo had been designed to withstand an attack by native tribes , not an artillery @-@ equipped army . The complex sprawled across 3 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 ha ) , providing almost 1 @,@ 320 feet ( 400 m ) of perimeter to defend . An interior plaza was bordered on the east by the chapel and to the south by a one @-@ story building known as the Low Barracks . A wooden palisade stretched between these two buildings . The two @-@ story Long Barracks extended north from the chapel . At the northern corner of the east wall stood a cattle pen and horse corral . The walls surrounding the complex were at least 2 @.@ 75 feet ( 0 @.@ 84 m ) thick and ranged from 9 – 12 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 – 3 @.@ 7 m ) high . 
 To compensate for the lack of firing ports , Texian engineer Green B. Jameson constructed catwalks to allow defenders to fire over the walls ; this method , however , left the rifleman 's upper body exposed . Mexican forces had left behind 19 cannons , which Jameson installed along the walls . A large 18 @-@ pounder had arrived in Texas with the New Orleans Greys . Jameson positioned this cannon in the southwest corner of the compound . He boasted to Texian Army commander Sam Houston that the Texians could " whip 10 to 1 with our artillery " . 
 The Texian garrison was woefully undermanned and <unk> , with fewer than 100 soldiers remaining by January 6 , 1836 . Colonel James C. Neill , the acting Alamo commander , wrote to the provisional government : " If there has ever been a dollar here I have no knowledge of it " . Neill requested additional troops and supplies , stressing that the garrison was likely to be unable to withstand a siege lasting longer than four days . The Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much assistance . Four different men claimed to have been given command over the entire army : on January 14 , Neill approached one of them , Sam Houston , for assistance in gathering supplies , clothing , and ammunition . 
 = = Prelude to battle = = 
 Houston could not spare the number of men necessary to mount a successful defense . Instead , he sent Colonel James Bowie with 30 men to remove the artillery from the Alamo and destroy the complex . Bowie was unable to transport the artillery since the Alamo garrison lacked the necessary draft animals . Neill soon persuaded Bowie that the location held strategic importance . In a letter to Governor Henry Smith , Bowie argued that " the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Béxar out of the hands of the enemy . It serves as the frontier picquet guard , and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna , there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march towards the Sabine . " The letter to Smith ended , " Colonel Neill and myself have come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy . " Bowie also wrote to the provisional government , asking for " men , money , rifles , and cannon powder " . Few reinforcements were authorized ; cavalry officer William B. Travis arrived in Béxar with 30 men on February 3 . Five days later , a small group of volunteers arrived , including the famous frontiersman and former U.S. Congressman David Crockett of Tennessee . 
 On February 11 , Neill left the Alamo , determined to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies . He transferred command to Travis , the highest @-@ ranking regular army officer in the garrison . Volunteers comprised much of the garrison , and they were unwilling to accept Travis as their leader . The men instead elected Bowie , who had a reputation as a fierce fighter , as their commander . Bowie celebrated by getting very intoxicated and creating havoc in Béxar . To mitigate the resulting ill feelings , Bowie agreed to share command with Travis . 
 As the Texians struggled to find men and supplies , Santa Anna continued to gather men at San Luis Potosi ; by the end of 1835 his army numbered 6 @,@ 019 soldiers . Rather than advance along the coast , where supplies and reinforcements could be easily delivered by sea , Santa Anna ordered his army inland to Béxar , the political center of Texas and the site of Cos 's defeat . The army began its march north in late December . Officers used the long journey to train the men . Many of the new recruits did not know how to use the sights of their guns , and many refused to fire from the shoulder because of the large recoil . 
 Progress was slow . There were not enough mules to transport all of the supplies , and many of the teamsters , all civilians , quit when their pay was delayed . The large number of <unk> – women and children who followed the army – consumed much of the already scarce supplies . The soldiers were soon reduced to partial rations . On February 12 they crossed the Rio Grande . Temperatures in Texas reached record lows , and by February 13 an estimated 15 – 16 inches ( 38 – 41 cm ) of snow had fallen . <unk> , dysentery , and Comanche raiding parties took a heavy toll on the Mexican soldiers . 
 On February 21 , Santa Anna and his vanguard reached the banks of the Medina River , 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Béxar . Unaware of the Mexican Army 's proximity , the majority of the Alamo garrison joined Béxar residents at a fiesta . After learning of the planned celebration , Santa Anna ordered General Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma to immediately seize the unprotected Alamo , but sudden rains halted that raid .

 In the early hours of February 23 , residents began fleeing Béxar , fearing the Mexican army 's imminent arrival . Although unconvinced by the reports , Travis stationed a soldier in the San Fernando church bell tower , the highest location in town , to watch for signs of an approaching force . Several hours later , Texian scouts reported seeing Mexican troops 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) outside the town . Few arrangements had been made for a potential siege . One group of Texians scrambled to herd cattle into the Alamo , while others scrounged for food in the recently abandoned houses . Several members of the garrison who had been living in town brought their families with them when they reported to the Alamo . Among these were Almaron Dickinson , who brought his wife Susanna and their infant daughter Angelina ; Bowie , who was accompanied by his deceased wife 's cousins , <unk> Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury , and Alsbury 's young son ; and Gregorio Esparza , whose family climbed through the window of the Alamo chapel after the Mexican army arrived . Other members of the garrison failed to report for duty ; most of the men working outside Béxar did not try to sneak past Mexican lines . 
 By late afternoon Béxar was occupied by about 1 @,@ 500 Mexican soldiers . When the Mexican troops raised a blood @-@ red flag signifying no quarter , Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo 's largest cannon . Believing that Travis had acted hastily , Bowie sent Jameson to meet with Santa Anna . Travis was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent his own representative , Captain Albert Martin . Both emissaries met with Colonel Juan Almonte and José <unk> . According to Almonte , the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be unconditional . On learning this , Bowie and Travis mutually agreed to fire the cannon again 
 = = = Skirmishes = = = 
 The first night of the siege was relatively quiet . Over the next few days , Mexican soldiers established artillery batteries , initially about 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) from the south and east walls of the Alamo . A third battery was positioned southeast of the fort . Each night the batteries inched closer to the Alamo walls . During the first week of the siege more than 200 cannonballs landed in the Alamo plaza . At first the Texians matched Mexican artillery fire , often reusing the Mexican cannonballs . On February 26 Travis ordered the artillery to conserve powder and shot . 
 Two notable events occurred on Wednesday , February 24 . At some point that day , Bowie collapsed from illness , leaving Travis in sole command of the garrison . Late that afternoon , two Mexican scouts became the first fatalities of the siege . The following morning , 200 – 300 Mexican soldiers crossed the San Antonio River and took cover in abandoned shacks near the Alamo walls . Several Texians ventured out to burn the huts while Texians within the Alamo provided cover fire . After a two @-@ hour skirmish the Mexican troops retreated to Béxar . Six Mexican soldiers were killed and four others were wounded . No Texians were injured . 
 A blue norther blew in on February 25 , dropping the temperature to 39 ° F ( 4 ° C ) . Neither army was prepared for the cold temperatures . Texian attempts to gather firewood were thwarted by Mexican troops . On the evening of February 26 Colonel Juan Bringas engaged several Texians who were burning more huts . According to historian J.R. Edmondson , one Texian was killed . Four days later , Texians shot and killed Private First Class <unk> Alvarez , a soldier from one of two battalions that Santa Anna had stationed on two sides of the Alamo . By March 1 , the number of Mexican casualties were nine dead and four wounded , while the Texian garrison had lost only one man . 
 = = = Reinforcements = = = 
 Santa Anna posted one company east of the Alamo , on the road to Gonzales . Almonte and 800 dragoons were stationed along the road to Goliad . Throughout the siege these towns had received multiple couriers , dispatched by Travis to plead for reinforcements and supplies . The most famous of his missives , written February 24 , was addressed To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World . According to historian Mary Deborah Petite , the letter is " considered by many as one of the masterpieces of American patriotism . " Copies of the letter were distributed across Texas , and eventually reprinted throughout the United States and much of Europe . At the end of the first day of the siege , Santa Anna 's troops were reinforced by 600 men under General Joaquin Ramirez y Sesma , bringing the Mexican army up to more than 2 @,@ 000 men . 
 As news of the siege spread throughout Texas , potential reinforcements gathered in Gonzales . They hoped to rendezvous with Colonel James Fannin , who was expected to arrive from Goliad with his garrison . On February 26 , after days of indecision , Fannin ordered 320 men , four cannons , and several supply wagons to march towards the Alamo , 90 miles ( 140 km ) away . This group traveled less than 1 @.@ 0 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) before turning back . Fannin blamed the retreat on his officers ; the officers and enlisted men accused Fannin of aborting the mission . 
 Texians gathered in Gonzales were unaware of Fannin 's return to Goliad , and most continued to wait . Impatient with the delay , on February 27 Travis ordered Samuel G. Bastian to go to Gonzales " to hurry up reinforcements " . According to historian Thomas Ricks Lindley , Bastian encountered the Gonzales Ranging Company led by Lieutenant George C. Kimble and Travis ' courier to Gonzales , Albert Martin , who had tired of waiting for Fannin . A Mexican patrol attacked , driving off four of the men including Bastian . In the darkness , the Texians fired on the remaining 32 men , whom they assumed were Mexican soldiers . One man was wounded , and his English curses convinced the defenders to open the gates . 
 On March 3 , the Texians watched from the walls as approximately 1 @,@ 000 Mexicans marched into Béxar . The Mexican army celebrated loudly throughout the afternoon , both in honor of their reinforcements and at the news that troops under General José de Urrea had soundly defeated Texian Colonel Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27 . Most of the Texians in the Alamo believed that Sesma had been leading the Mexican forces during the siege , and they mistakenly attributed the celebration to the arrival of Santa Anna . The reinforcements brought the number of Mexican soldiers in Béxar to almost 3 @,@ 100 . 
 The arrival of the Mexican reinforcements prompted Travis to send three men , including Davy Crockett , to find Fannin 's force , which he still believed to be en route . The scouts discovered a large group of Texians camped 20 miles ( 32 km ) from the Alamo . Lindley 's research indicates that up to 50 of these men had come from Goliad after Fannin 's aborted rescue mission . The others had left Gonzales several days earlier . Just before daylight on March 4 , part of the Texian force broke through Mexican lines and entered the Alamo . Mexican soldiers drove a second group across the prairie . 
 = = = Assault preparations = = = 
 On March 4 , the day after his reinforcements arrived , Santa Anna proposed an assault on the Alamo . Many of his senior officers recommended that they wait for two 12 @-@ pounder cannons anticipated to arrive on March 7 . That evening , a local woman , likely Bowie 's cousin @-@ in @-@ law Juana Navarro Alsbury , approached Santa Anna to negotiate a surrender for the Alamo defenders . According to many historians , this visit probably increased Santa Anna 's impatience ; as historian Timothy Todish noted , " there would have been little glory in a bloodless victory " . The following morning , Santa Anna announced to his staff that the assault would take place early on March 6 . Santa Anna arranged for troops from Béxar to be excused from the front lines so that they would not be forced to fight their own families . 
 Legend holds that at some point on March 5 , Travis gathered his men and explained that an attack was imminent , and that they were greatly outnumbered by the Mexican Army . He supposedly drew a line in the ground and asked those willing to die for the Texian cause to cross and stand alongside him ; only one man ( Moses Rose ) was said to have declined . Most scholars disregard this tale as there is no primary source evidence to support it ( the story only surfaced decades after the battle in a third @-@ hand account ) . However , Travis apparently did , at some point prior to the final assault , assemble the men for a conference to inform them of the dire situation and giving them the chance to either escape or stay and die for the cause . Susannah Dickinson recalled Travis announcing that any men who wished to escape should let it be known and step out of ranks . 
 The last Texian verified to have left the Alamo was James Allen , a courier who carried personal messages from Travis and several of the other men on March 5 .

 = = = Exterior fighting = = = 
 At 10 p.m. on March 5 , the Mexican artillery ceased their bombardment . As Santa Anna had anticipated , the exhausted Texians soon fell into the first uninterrupted sleep many of them had since the siege began . Just after midnight , more than 2 @,@ 000 Mexican soldiers began preparing for the final assault . Fewer than 1 @,@ 800 were divided into four columns , commanded by Cos , Colonel Francisco Duque , Colonel José María Romero and Colonel Juan Morales . Veterans were positioned on the outside of the columns to better control the new recruits and conscripts in the middle . As a precaution , 500 Mexican cavalry were positioned around the Alamo to prevent escape of either Texian or Mexican soldiers . Santa Anna remained in camp with the 400 reserves . Despite the bitter cold , the soldiers were ordered not to wear overcoats which could impede their movements . Clouds concealed the moon and thus the movements of the soldiers . 
 At 5 : 30 a.m. troops silently advanced . Cos and his men approached the northwest corner of the Alamo , while Duque led his men from the northwest towards a repaired breach in the Alamo 's north wall . The column commanded by Romero marched towards the east wall , and Morales 's column aimed for the low parapet by the chapel . 
 The three Texian sentinels stationed outside the walls were killed in their sleep , allowing Mexican soldiers to approach undetected within musket range of the walls . At this point , the silence was broken by shouts of " ¡ Viva Santa Anna ! " and music from the buglers . The noise woke the Texians . Most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety . Travis rushed to his post yelling , " Come on boys , the Mexicans are upon us and we 'll give them hell ! " and , as he passed a group of Tejanos , " ¡ No <unk> , <unk> ! " ( " Don 't surrender , boys " ) . 
 In the initial moments of the assault Mexican troops were at a disadvantage . Their column formation allowed only the front rows of soldiers to fire safely . Unaware of the dangers , the untrained recruits in the ranks " blindly fir [ ed ] their guns " , injuring or killing the troops in front of them . The tight concentration of troops also offered an excellent target for the Texian artillery . Lacking canister shot , Texians filled their cannon with any metal they could find , including door hinges , nails , and chopped @-@ up horseshoes , essentially turning the cannon into giant shotguns . According to the diary of José Enrique de la Peña , " a single cannon volley did away with half the company of chasseurs from Toluca " . Duque fell from his horse after suffering a wound in his thigh and was almost trampled by his own men . General Manuel Castrillón quickly assumed command of Duque 's column . 
 Although some in the front of the Mexican ranks wavered , soldiers in the rear pushed them on . As the troops massed against the walls , Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot , leaving them exposed to Mexican fire . Travis became one of the first defenders to die , shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him , though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury . Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls . The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back . As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles , however , they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls . 
 Mexican soldiers withdrew and regrouped , but their second attack was repulsed . Fifteen minutes into the battle , they attacked a third time . During the third strike , Romero 's column , aiming for the east wall , was exposed to cannon fire and shifted to the north , mingling with the second column . Cos ' column , under fire from Texians on the west wall , also veered north . When Santa Anna saw that the bulk of his army was massed against the north wall , he feared a rout ; " panicked " , he sent the reserves into the same area . The Mexican soldiers closest to the north wall realized that the makeshift wall contained many gaps and <unk> . One of the first to scale the 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) wall was General Juan Amador ; at his challenge , his men began swarming up the wall . Amador opened the postern in the north wall , allowing Mexican soldiers to pour into the complex . Others climbed through gun ports in the west wall , which had few defenders . As the Texian defenders abandoned the north wall and the northern end of the west wall , Texian gunners at the south end of the mission turned their cannon towards the north and fired into the advancing Mexican soldiers . This left the south end of the mission unprotected ; within minutes Mexican soldiers had climbed the walls and killed the gunners , gaining control of the Alamo 's 18 @-@ pounder cannon . By this time Romero 's men had taken the east wall of the compound and were pouring in through the cattle pen . 
 = = = Interior fighting = = = 
 As previously planned , most of the Texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel . Holes had been carved in the walls to allow the Texians to fire . Unable to reach the barracks , Texians stationed along the west wall headed west for the San Antonio River . When the cavalry charged , the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch . Sesma was forced to send reinforcements , and the Texians were eventually killed . Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50 Texians , but Edmondson believes that number was inflated . 
 The defenders in the cattle pen retreated into the horse corral . After discharging their weapons , the small band of Texians scrambled over the low wall , circled behind the church and raced on foot for the east prairie , which appeared empty . As the Mexican cavalry advanced on the group , Almaron Dickinson and his artillery crew turned a cannon around and fired into the cavalry , probably inflicting casualties . Nevertheless , all of the escaping Texians were killed . 
 The last Texian group to remain in the open were Crockett and his men , defending the low wall in front of the church . Unable to reload , they used their rifles as clubs and fought with knives . After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets , the few remaining Texians in this group fell back towards the church . The Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls . Mexican soldiers turned their attention to a Texian flag waving from the roof of one building . Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised in that location . 
 For the next hour , the Mexican army worked to secure complete control of the Alamo . Many of the remaining defenders were ensconced in the fortified barracks rooms . In the confusion , the Texians had neglected to spike their cannon before retreating . Mexican soldiers turned the cannon towards the barracks . As each door was blown off Mexican soldiers would fire a volley of muskets into the dark room , then charge in for hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . 
 Too sick to participate in the battle , Bowie likely died in bed . Eyewitnesses to the battle gave conflicting accounts of his death . Some witnesses maintained that they saw several Mexican soldiers enter Bowie 's room , bayonet him , and carry him alive from the room . Others claimed that Bowie shot himself or was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head . According to historian Wallace Chariton , the " most popular , and probably the most accurate " version is that Bowie died on his cot , " back braced against the wall , and using his pistols and his famous knife . " 
 The last of the Texians to die were the 11 men manning the two 12 @-@ pounder cannon in the chapel . A shot from the 18 @-@ pounder cannon destroyed the barricades at the front of the church , and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley . Dickinson 's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers at the door . With no time to reload , the Texians , including Dickinson , Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham , grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death . Texian Robert Evans , the master of ordnance , had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands . Wounded , he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder . Had he succeeded , the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and children hiding in the sacristy . 
 As soldiers approached the sacristy , one of the young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket over his shoulders . In the dark , Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him . Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker , who attempted to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women . Another Texian , <unk> Guerrero , also sought refuge in the sacristy . Guerrero , who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835 , was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner . 
 By 6 : 30 a.m. the battle for the Alamo was over . Mexican soldiers inspected each corpse , bayoneting any body that moved . Even with all of the Texians dead , Mexican soldiers continued to shoot , some killing each other in the confusion . Mexican generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help . Although the general showed himself , the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat . For 15 minutes after that , soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies .

 = = = Casualties = = = 
 According to many accounts of the battle , between five and seven Texians surrendered . Incensed that his orders had been ignored , Santa Anna demanded the immediate execution of the survivors . Weeks after the battle , stories circulated that Crockett was among those who surrendered . However , Ben , a former American slave who cooked for one of Santa Anna 's officers , maintained that Crockett 's body was found surrounded by " no less than sixteen Mexican corpses " . Historians disagree on which version of Crockett 's death is accurate . 
 Santa Anna reportedly told Captain Fernando <unk> that the battle " was but a small affair " . Another officer then remarked that " with another such victory as this , we 'll go to the devil " . In his initial report Santa Anna claimed that 600 Texians had been killed , with only 70 Mexican soldiers killed and 300 wounded . His secretary , Ramón Martínez Caro , later repudiated the report . Other estimates of the number of Mexican soldiers killed ranged from 60 – 200 , with an additional 250 – 300 wounded . Most Alamo historians place the number of Mexican casualties at 400 – 600 . This would represent about one @-@ third of the Mexican soldiers involved in the final assault , which Todish remarks is " a tremendous casualty rate by any standards " . Most eyewitnesses counted between 182 – 257 Texians killed . Some historians believe that at least one Texian , Henry Warnell , successfully escaped from the battle . Warnell died several months later of wounds incurred either during the final battle or during his escape as a courier . 
 Mexican soldiers were buried in the local cemetery , Campo Santo . Shortly after the battle , Colonel José Juan Sanchez Navarro proposed that a monument should be erected to the fallen Mexican soldiers . Cos rejected the idea . 
 The Texian bodies were stacked and burned . The only exception was the body of Gregorio Esparza . His brother Francisco , an officer in Santa Anna 's army , received permission to give Gregorio a proper burial . The ashes were left where they fell until February 1837 , when Juan Seguín returned to Béxar to examine the remains . A simple coffin inscribed with the names Travis , Crockett , and Bowie was filled with ashes from the funeral pyres . According to a March 28 , 1837 , article in the Telegraph and Texas Register , Seguín buried the coffin under a peach tree grove . The spot was not marked and cannot now be identified . Seguín later claimed that he had placed the coffin in front of the altar at the San Fernando Cathedral . In July 1936 a coffin was discovered buried in that location , but according to historian Wallace Chariton it is unlikely to actually contain the remains of the Alamo defenders . Fragments of uniforms were found in the coffin , and it is known that the Alamo defenders did not wear uniforms . 
 = = = Texian survivors = = = 
 In an attempt to convince other slaves in Texas to support the Mexican government over the Texian rebellion , Santa Anna spared Travis ' slave , Joe . The day after the battle , he interviewed each noncombatant individually . Impressed with Susanna Dickinson , Santa Anna offered to adopt her infant daughter Angelina and have the child educated in Mexico City . Dickinson refused the offer , which was not extended to Juana Navarro Alsbury although her son was of similar age . Each woman was given a blanket and two silver pesos . Alsbury and the other Tejano women were allowed to return to their homes in Béxar ; Dickinson , her daughter and Joe were sent to Gonzales , escorted by Ben . They were encouraged to relate the events of the battle , and to inform the remainder of the Texian forces that Santa Anna 's army was unbeatable . 
 = = = Impact on revolution = = = 
 During the siege , newly elected delegates from across Texas met at the Convention of 1836 . On March 2 , the delegates declared independence , forming the Republic of Texas . Four days later , the delegates at the convention received a dispatch Travis had written March 3 warning of his dire situation . Unaware that the Alamo had fallen , Robert Potter called for the convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve the Alamo . Sam Houston convinced the delegates to remain in Washington @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Brazos to develop a constitution . After being appointed sole commander of all Texian troops , Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the 400 volunteers who were still waiting for Fannin to lead them to the Alamo . 
 Within hours of Houston 's arrival on March 11 , Andres <unk> and Anselmo <unk> arrived with news that the Alamo had fallen and all Texians were slain . Hoping to halt a panic , Houston arrested the men as enemy spies . They were released hours later when Susannah Dickinson and Joe reached Gonzales and confirmed the report . Realizing that the Mexican army would soon advance towards the Texian settlements , Houston advised all civilians in the area to evacuate and ordered his new army to retreat . This sparked a mass exodus , known as the Runaway Scrape , and most Texians , including members of the new government , fled east . 
 Despite their losses at the Alamo , the Mexican army in Texas outnumbered the Texian army by almost six to one . Santa Anna assumed that knowledge of the disparity in troop numbers and the fate of the Texian soldiers at the Alamo would quell the resistance , and that Texian soldiers would quickly leave the territory . News of the Alamo 's fall had the opposite effect , and men flocked to Houston 's army . The New York Post editorialized that " had [ Santa Anna ] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity , it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren " . 
 On the afternoon of April 21 the Texian army attacked Santa Anna 's camp near Lynchburg Ferry . The Mexican army was taken by surprise , and the Battle of San Jacinto was essentially over after 18 minutes . During the fighting , many of the Texian soldiers repeatedly cried " Remember the Alamo ! " as they slaughtered fleeing Mexican troops . Santa Anna was captured the following day , and reportedly told Houston : " That man may consider himself born to no common destiny who has conquered the Napoleon of the West . And now it remains for him to be generous to the vanquished . " Houston replied , " You should have remembered that at the Alamo " . Santa Anna was forced to order his troops out of Texas , ending Mexican control of the province and giving some legitimacy to the new republic . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Following the battle , Santa Anna was alternately viewed as a national hero or a pariah . Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint . Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto , and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been , or had become , his outspoken critics . Petite and many other historians believe that some of the stories , such as the execution of Crockett , may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna . In Mexican history , the Texas campaign , including the Battle of the Alamo , was soon overshadowed by the Mexican – American War of 1846 – 48 . 
 In San Antonio de Béxar , the largely Tejano population viewed the Alamo complex as more than just a battle site ; it represented decades of assistance — as a mission , a hospital , or a military post . As the English @-@ speaking population increased , the complex became best known for the battle . Focus has centered primarily on the Texian defenders , with little emphasis given to the role of the Tejano soldiers who served in the Texian army or the actions of the Mexican army . In the early 20th century the Texas Legislature purchased the property and appointed the Daughters of the Republic of Texas as permanent caretakers of what is now an official state shrine . In front of the church , in the center of Alamo Plaza , stands a cenotaph , designed by Pompeo Coppini , which commemorates the Texians and Tejanos who died during the battle . According to Bill Groneman 's Battlefields of Texas , the Alamo has become " the most popular tourist site in Texas " . 
 The first English @-@ language histories of the battle were written and published by Texas Ranger and amateur historian John Henry Brown . The next major treatment of the battle was Reuben Potter 's The Fall of the Alamo , published in The Magazine of American History in 1878 . Potter based his work on interviews with many of the Mexican survivors of the battle . The first full @-@ length , non @-@ fiction book covering the battle , John Myers Myers ' The Alamo , was published in 1948 . In the decades since , the battle has featured prominently in many non @-@ fiction works . 
 According to Todish et al . , " there can be little doubt that most Americans have probably formed many of their opinions on what occurred at the Alamo not from books , but from the various movies made about the battle . " The first film version of the battle appeared in 1911 , when Gaston Méliès directed The Immortal Alamo . The battle became more widely known after it was featured in the 1950s Disney miniseries Davy Crockett , which was largely based on myth . Within several years , John Wayne directed and starred in one of the best @-@ known , but questionably accurate , film versions , 1960 's The Alamo . In 2004 another film , also called The Alamo , was released . CNN described it as possibly " the most character @-@ driven of all the movies made on the subject " . It is also considered more faithful to the actual events than other movies . 
 A number of songwriters have been inspired by the Battle of the Alamo . Tennessee Ernie Ford 's " The Ballad of Davy Crockett " spent 16 weeks on the country music charts , peaking at No. 4 in 1955 . Marty Robbins recorded a version of the song " The Ballad of the Alamo " in 1960 which spent 13 weeks on the pop charts , peaking at No. 34 . Jane Bowers ' song " Remember the Alamo " has been recorded by artists including Johnny Cash and Donovan . 
 The U.S. Post Office issued two postage stamps in commemoration of the Battle of Alamo and Texas Statehood . 
 = Asia Bibi blasphemy case = 
 <unk> Noreen ( Urdu : <unk> <unk> ALA @-@ LC <unk> <unk> IPA : [ <unk> <unk> ] better known as Asia Bibi , Urdu : <unk> <unk> <unk> ALA @-@ LC <unk> Bī Bī IPA : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] , born c . 1971 ) is a Pakistani Christian woman who was convicted of blasphemy by a Pakistani court , receiving a sentence of death by hanging . In June 2009 , Noreen was involved in an argument with a group of Muslim women with whom she had been harvesting berries after the other women grew angry with her for drinking the same water as them . She was subsequently accused of insulting the Islamic prophet Muhammad , a charge she denies , and was arrested and imprisoned . In November 2010 , a Sheikhupura judge sentenced her to death . If executed , Noreen would be the first woman in Pakistan to be lawfully killed for blasphemy . 
 The verdict , which was reached in a district court and would need to be upheld by a superior court , has received worldwide attention . Various petitions , including one that received 400 @,@ 000 signatures , were organized to protest Noreen 's imprisonment , and Pope Benedict XVI publicly called for the charges against her to be dismissed . She received less sympathy from her neighbors and Islamic religious leaders in the country , some of whom adamantly called for her to be executed . Christian minorities minister Shahbaz Bhatti and Pakistani politician Salmaan Taseer were both killed for advocating on her behalf and opposing the blasphemy laws . Noreen 's family went into hiding after receiving death threats , some of which threatened to kill Asia if released from prison . 
 = = Background and arrest = = 
 <unk> Noreen was born and raised in <unk> Wali , a small , rural village in the Sheikhupura District of Punjab , Pakistan , thirty miles outside of Lahore . Christians in the district , and elsewhere in Pakistan , usually have lower class occupations such as being cleaners and sweepers . Noreen , who is a Roman Catholic , worked as a farmhand in Sheikhupura to support her family . She married Ashiq Masih , a brick laborer who had three children from a previous marriage , and had two more children with him . Noreen and her family were the only Christians in the village . Before her incarceration , she had been repeatedly urged by her fellow workers to convert to Islam . 
 In June 2009 , Noreen was harvesting <unk> berries with a group of other farmhands in a field in Sheikhupura . She was asked at one point to fetch water from a nearby well ; she complied but stopped to take a drink with an old metal cup she had found lying next to the well . A neighbor of Noreen , who had been involved in a running feud with Noreen 's family about some property damage , saw her and angrily told her that it was forbidden for a Christian to drink water from the same utensil from which Muslims drink , and some of the other workers considered her to be unclean because she was a Christian . Some arguments ensued . Noreen recounts that when they made derogatory statements about her religion , she responded , " I believe in my religion and in Jesus Christ , who died on the cross for the sins of mankind . What did your Prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind ? " 
 Later , some of the workers complained to a cleric that Noreen insulted Muhammad . A mob came to her house , beating her and members of her family before she was rescued by the police . The police initiated an investigation about her remarks , resulting in her arrest under Section 295 C of the Pakistan Penal Code . She subsequently was imprisoned for over a year before being formally charged . 
 = = Prosecution and imprisonment = = 
 Noreen denied that she had committed blasphemy and said that she had been accused by her neighbor to " settle an old score " . In November 2010 , Muhammed <unk> Iqbal , a judge at the court of Sheikhupura , Punjab , sentenced her to death by hanging . Additionally , a fine of the equivalent of $ 1 @,@ 100 was imposed . With the verdict , she became the first woman condemned to death in Pakistan on blasphemy charges . Noreen described the day of her sentencing as follows : 
 I cried alone , putting my head in my hands . I can no longer bear the sight of people full of hatred , applauding the killing of a poor farm worker . I no longer see them , but I still hear them , the crowd who gave the judge a standing ovation , saying : " Kill her , kill her ! Allahu Akbar ! " The court house is invaded by a euphoric horde who break down the doors , chanting : " Vengeance for the holy prophet . Allah is great ! " I was then thrown like an old rubbish sack into the van ... I had lost all humanity in their eyes . 
 Noreen 's husband , Ashiq Masih , 51 years old at the time , announced that he planned to appeal the verdict , which has to be upheld by the Lahore High Court . A month later , Salmaan Taseer , the governor of Punjab who investigated the affair for the President Asif Ali Zardari , stated that Noreen would most likely be pardoned if the High Court did not suspend the sentence . Zardari was poised to grant pardon but Lahore High Court issued a stay order against potential Presidential pardon , which remains in force till date . Court transcripts show numerous inconsistencies in the evidence presented and reporters say they dare not repeat Bibi 's testimony lest they also be accused of blasphemy . 
 Noreen was put in solitary confinement in an 8 @-@ by @-@ 10 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m × 3 @.@ 0 m ) cell without windows at the Lahore prison . Before his assassination , Taseer visited her at the jail several times with his wife , <unk> , and daughter , <unk> , though Pakistani court officials later ruled that she could be visited only by her husband and lawyer . Khalid Sheikh , the prison superintendent , said that while he wanted her to be treated " like any other prisoner " , she had to be kept away from other inmates for her own well @-@ being , as other individuals accused of blasphemy had been killed while in prison . Out of concern that she could be poisoned , prison officials began giving Noreen raw materials to cook her own food . The <unk> Foundation , a human rights group , described her physical condition as " very frail " , and her health was reported to be in decline due to poor living conditions at the jail . She has also been threatened by other inmates and subjected to physical abuse from prison guards . 
 According to Human Rights Watch , Noreen 's situation is not unusual . Though no one has been executed for blasphemy yet in Pakistan , the accused often remain imprisoned for an extensive amount of time while the case is being processed . In May 2014 , Noreen 's appeal hearing was delayed for the fifth time . 
 = = Appeals = = 
 On October 16 , 2014 the Lahore High Court dismissed Noreen 's appeal and upheld her death sentence . On November 20 , 2014 , her husband appealed to Pakistan 's President for clemency . On November 24 , 2014 , her lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court . 
 On July 22 , 2015 the Supreme Court of Pakistan suspended Bibi 's death sentence for the duration of the appeals process . In November of 2015 , Bibi 's lead attorney , Naeem Shakir , announced that , after two postponements in 2015 , the Lahore High Court would hear an appeal in Bibi 's case on March 26 , 2016 . 
 = = Local reactions = = 
 Noreen 's conviction led to divided opinions on the blasphemy laws and drew strong reactions from the public . Pakistani Human Rights Watch researcher Ali Dayan Hasan said , " The law creates this legal infrastructure which is then used in various informal ways to intimidate , coerce , harass and persecute . " He further described the law as " discriminatory and abusive " . Governor Salmaan Taseer and Pakistan 's Minority Affairs Minister Shahbaz Bhatti both publicly supported Noreen , with the latter saying , " I will go to every knock for justice on her behalf and I will take all steps for her protection . " She also received support from Pakistani political scientist Rasul Baksh Rais and local priest Samson <unk> . The imprisonment of Noreen left Christians and other minorities in Pakistan feeling vulnerable , and liberal Muslims were also unnerved by her sentencing . 
 The general population was less sympathetic towards Noreen . Several signs were erected in Sheikhupura and other rural areas declaring support for the blasphemy laws , including one that called for Noreen to be beheaded . Mohammad Saleem , a member of the Jamiat Ulema @-@ e @-@ Pakistan Party , organized a demonstration in Rawalpindi and led a small crowd chanting , " Hang her , hang her . " In December 2010 , a month after Noreen 's conviction , a Muslim cleric announced a 500 @,@ 000 Pakistani rupee award ( the equivalent of $ 10 @,@ 000 ) to anyone who would kill her . One survey reported that around 10 million Pakistanis had said that they would be willing to personally kill her out of either religious conviction or for the reward . The village mosque in <unk> Wali was reportedly indifferent towards Noreen 's plight ; its imam , Qari Mohammed Salim , stated that he had wept for joy on learning that she had been sentenced to death and threatened that some people would " take the law into their own hands " should she be pardoned or released . However , journalist Julie McCarthy suggested that the country 's " more peaceful majority views " had been overshadowed by the more vocal fundamentalists . 
 Noreen 's family has received threats and has gone into hiding . Ashiq , her husband , stated that he was afraid to let their children go outside . He also expressed concern about how Noreen would be kept safe should she be released , saying , " No one will let her live . The mullahs are saying they will kill her when she comes out . " Her family declined to leave the country while she remained in prison , but Italy , France , and Spain all offered to grant her and her family asylum in the event of her release . 
 = = = Assassinations of Taseer and Bhatti = = = 
 On 4 January 2011 , at <unk> Market of Islamabad , the governor of Punjab , Salmaan Taseer , was assassinated by Malik Mumtaz Hussein Qadri , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old member of his security team , because of his defence of Noreen and opposition to the blasphemy law . ( Mumtaz Qadri was sentenced to death for the assassination and hanged on February 29 , 2016 . ) Taseer was outspoken in his criticism of the law and the verdict in Noreen 's case . The next day , thousands turned up for the governor 's funeral in Lahore in spite of warnings by the Taliban and some clerics , while a portion of the Pakistani population also praised Qadri as a hero ; thousands of Sunni Muslims rallied in support of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan after the murder , and 500 <unk> clerics prohibited their followers from sending condolences to the family of Taseer . This resulted in concerns that the public was becoming tolerant of extremists . 
 Prison officials said that Noreen " wept <unk> " on learning of Taseer 's assassination while repeatedly saying , " That man came here and he sacrificed his life for me . " Father Andrew <unk> , a senior Catholic Spokesperson in Lahore , described the situation as " utter chaos " . Seven months later , Taseer 's 28 @-@ year @-@ old son , Shahbaz , was kidnapped . <unk> was later found or released in March 2016 , and he returned to Lahore on March 9 after five years in captivity . 
 Minority Affairs Minister Shahbaz Bhatti said that he was first threatened with death in June 2010 when he was told that he would be beheaded if he attempted to change the blasphemy laws . In response , he told reporters that he was " committed to the principle of justice for the people of Pakistan " and willing to die fighting for Noreen 's release . On 2 March 2011 , Bhatti was shot dead by gunmen who ambushed his car near his residence in Islamabad , presumably because of his position on the blasphemy laws . He had been the only Christian member of Pakistan 's cabinet . 
 = = International response = = 
 Noreen 's death sentence drew international outrage and strong condemnation from human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch who saw the blasphemy laws as a form of religious persecution and called for them to be abolished . Pope Benedict XVI publicly called for clemency for Noreen . In his statement , he described his " spiritual closeness " with Noreen and urged that the " human dignity and fundamental rights of everyone in similar situations " be respected . 
 Her case also achieved extensive media coverage , and American journalist John L. Allen , Jr. writes that she is " almost certainly the most famous illiterate Punjabi farm worker and mother of five on the planet " . According to Allen , she has become a celebrity among Christian activists , an unusual instance when cases of discrimination against Christian minorities typically receive little attention in the press . A number of campaigns have been organized to protest her imprisonment through online petitions , Twitter trends , and concerts . <unk> , a Christian pop band based in the United Kingdom collaborated with the British Pakistani Christian Association , and released a song titled " Free Asia Bibi " with a music video that included " a disturbing visual portrayal of the squalid prison conditions where Bibi is being held " . She has also been the subject of books and documentaries . 
 One petition received over 400 @,@ 000 signatures from individuals from over 100 countries . Another petition , organised by the American Centre for Law & Justice ( <unk> ) , obtained over 200 @,@ 000 signatures and called for America 's eight billion dollar yearly aid to Pakistan to stop whilst persecution of minorities is allowed in that country .

 French journalist Anne Isabelle Tollet assisted Noreen in writing a memoir titled Blasphemy : A Memoir : Sentenced to Death over a Cup of Water . Noreen is illiterate , and Tollet was unable to visit her directly due to prison restrictions , but Tollet was able to conduct interviews through Noreen 's husband , who passed questions and answers between them . Tollet also met other members of Noreen 's family , including her children and sister , and had known Shahbaz Bhatti before his assassination . 
 = The Shooting Star = 
 The Shooting Star ( French : L 'Étoile <unk> ) is the tenth volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . The story was serialised daily in Le Soir , Belgium 's leading francophone newspaper , from October 1941 to May 1942 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II . The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin , who travels with his dog Snowy and friend Captain Haddock aboard a scientific expedition to the Arctic Ocean on an international race to find a meteorite that has fallen to the Earth . 
 The Shooting Star was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion ; the first Tintin volume to be originally published in the 62 @-@ page full @-@ colour format . Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Secret of the Unicorn , while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco @-@ Belgian comics tradition . The Shooting Star has received a mixed critical reception and has been one of the most controversial instalments in the series due to the anti @-@ Semitic portrayal of its villain . The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series , Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin , and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 A giant meteoroid approaches the earth , spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle , while a self @-@ proclaimed prophet , Philippulus , predicts the end of the world . The meteoroid misses the earth , but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean . Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names <unk> , and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists . Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy , their ship , the Aurora , is helmed by Tintin 's friend Captain Haddock . Meanwhile , another team has set out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary , backed by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel ; wherefore , the expedition becomes a race to land on the meteorite . On the day of departure , Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick of dynamite on the Aurora , but it is found and thrown overboard . In the North Sea , the Aurora is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel 's ships , but Haddock steers out of the way . Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of Akureyri , when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available . He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his , Captain Chester , who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company ( which has a fuel monopoly ) is owned by Bohlwinkel . The three then secretly run a hose from Chester 's ship , Sirius , to the Aurora , and thus trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need . 
 Close to the Peary , the Aurora receives an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help ; but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them . Resuming the journey , they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition has reached the meteorite but not yet claimed it . While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite , Tintin uses the Aurora 's seaplane to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition 's flag . Tintin makes camp while the Aurora 's engines are repaired . The next day he discovers that <unk> accelerates growth , and makes things much larger : his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly , and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider and immense , explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives . A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea , just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the Aurora with a piece of <unk> . Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes . As the Aurora returns home , Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil , but with whiskey .

 Amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II , Hergé had found employment at Le Soir , Belgium 's leading newspaper , then under the administrative control of the occupying military government . His latest serial , The Shooting Star , initially featured the United States as the primary antagonists ; explaining this , Hergé asserted that the story revolved around the theme of " the rivalry for progress between Europe and the United States " . Although not disliking Americans themselves , he had a strong disdain for American big business , and had exhibited anti @-@ American themes in earlier works , in particular in Tintin in America . During serialisation of The Shooting Star , in December 1941 , the U.S. entered the war on the side of the Allies , thus coming into direct conflict with Germany . All of the scientists featured were from Axis or neutral countries , which might be a reflection of the strip 's anti @-@ Allies political slant . Entertainment producer and author Harry Thompson stated this should not be interpreted as a strong anti @-@ Ally bias , for the only two nation @-@ states in Europe that were part of the Allies at that point were the Soviet Union and United Kingdom , and that the characters of Haddock and Chester were British . 
 As he had done for other Adventures of Tintin which featured sea travel , Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible in order to make his portrayals more realistic . The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby , while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship , the RRS Discovery . The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196 @-@ A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area , saying that if Aurora had been a real ship , it would probably be unseaworthy . 
 The Shooting Star shared plot similarities with The Chase of the Golden Meteor , a 1908 novel by pioneering French science @-@ fiction writer Jules Verne . As in Hergé 's story , Verne 's novel features an expedition to the North Atlantic to find a meteorite fragment containing a new element . In both stories , the competing expedition teams were led by an eccentric professor and a Jewish banker , and Verne 's novel had a Doktor Schultze to Hergé 's Professor Schulze — both from the University of Jena . Hergé denied deliberately copying Verne 's story , saying that he had only read one of the French novelist 's works ; it is possible that the influence from Verne came via Jacques Van Melkebeke , Hergé 's friend and assistant , who was a fan of the genre . The Swedish expedition member Eric <unk> physically resembles a real person : Auguste Piccard , who later became Hergé 's inspiration for Professor Calculus . 
 = = = Anti @-@ Semitism = = = 
 Under Nazi control , Le Soir was publishing a variety of anti @-@ Semitic articles , calling for the Jews to be further excluded from public life and describing them as racial enemies of the Belgian people . Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline noted that there was a " remarkable correlation " between the anti @-@ Semitic nature of Le Soir 's editorials and The Shooting Star 's depiction of Jews . Within months of the story 's publication , legislation was passed to collect and deport Jews from Belgium to Nazi concentration camps . Thus , The Shooting Star reflected trends in the Belgian political situation at the time . However , the story was not the first time that Hergé had adopted such a perspective in his work ; he had recently provided illustrations for Robert de <unk> 's Fables , a number of which contained anti @-@ Semitic stereotypes , reflecting the racism in much of de <unk> 's book . Similarly , his depiction of the character of Rastapopoulos , who was introduced in Tintin in America , has been cited as being based upon anti @-@ Semitic stereotypes . 
 When The Shooting Star appeared in Le Soir , Hergé featured a gag in which two Jews hear the prophetic news that the end of the world is near . They rub their hands together in eagerness , and one comments : " Did you hear , Isaac ? The end of the world ! What if it 's true ? " The other responds : " Hey , hey , it <unk> be a gut ding , Solomon ! I owe my suppliers 50 @,@ 000 francs , and zis way I von 't <unk> to pay <unk> ! " Hergé omitted this scene from the collected edition . 
 The character of Blumenstein displays anti @-@ Semitic stereotypes , such as having a bulbous nose and being an avaricious , manipulative businessman . Hergé later dismissed concerns over this Jewish caricature , saying , " That was the style then . " In his assessment of Franco @-@ Belgian comics , Matthew Screech expressed the opinion that Blumenstein was an anti @-@ American stereotype rather than an anti @-@ Jewish one . Similarly , reporter and Tintin expert Michael Farr asserted that Blumenstein was " more parodied as a financier than Jew " . Conversely , Lofficier and Lofficier asserted that both anti @-@ Americanism and anti @-@ Semitism were present , and that it is the United States and International Jewry who were the " ruthless opponents " of Tintin . Nazi apologists and revisionists such as French Holocaust denier Olivier Mathieu used The Shooting Star as evidence that Hergé was an anti @-@ Semite with Nazi sympathies . 
 To graphic novel specialist Hugo Frey , the competing expeditions are presented as a simplistic race between good and evil , wherein <unk> displays the stereotypes of Jews held by advocates of the Jewish World Conspiracy presented in works such as the anti @-@ Semitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion . Frey writes that Blumenstein 's " large and bulbous nose ... rounded forehead , receding black hair , and small beady eyes " were stock anti @-@ Semitic imagery in the 1930s and 1940s , as promoted by those such as journalist Édouard Drumont , whose anti @-@ Semitic Paris @-@ based newspaper La Libre Parole was influential in Brussels . According to Frey , Blumenstein 's depiction as an overweight cigar @-@ smoker reflected the anti @-@ Semitic stereotype of Jews as being financially powerful , while he suggested that the scene in which Blumenstein learned that he was to be tracked down for his crimes recalled the contemporary roundup of Jews in Nazi Europe . Frey contrasts Hergé 's complicity with the anti @-@ Semites to the actions of others Belgians , such as those who struck against the Nazis at the Université libre de Bruxelles and those who risked their lives to hide Jews .

 The Shooting Star was serialised daily in Le Soir from 20 October 1941 to 21 May 1942 in French under the title L 'Étoile <unk> ( The Mysterious Star ) . Tintin 's previous adventure , The Crab with the Golden Claws , had been serialised weekly until the demise of Le Soir 's children 's supplement , Le Soir Jeunesse , before continuing daily in the main newspaper itself ; the earlier serial had ended the day before The Shooting Star began . The Shooting Star was the first Tintin adventure to be serialised daily in its entirety . As with earlier Adventures of Tintin , the story was later serialised in France in the Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants , where it first appeared on 6 June 1943 . 
 On page 20 of the published book , Hergé included a cameo of the characters Thomson and Thompson and Quick & Flupke . The story also introduced Captain Chester , who is mentioned in later adventures , and Professor <unk> , who returns in The Seven Crystal Balls . 
 On 21 May 1942 , The Shooting Star concluded serialisation . Less than a week later , the occupied government proclaimed that all Jews in Belgium would have to wear a yellow badge on their clothing , and in July the Gestapo began raids on Jewish premises , followed by deportations of Jews to Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps , resulting in around 32 @,@ 000 Belgian Jews being killed . Hergé later recalled : " I saw very few Jews wearing the yellow star , but finally I did see some . They told me that some Jews were gone ; that people had come for them and sent them away . I didn 't want to believe it . " 
 The earlier Tintin albums reproduced the newspaper strips , which had come to appear weekly in Thursday supplements , two @-@ page allotments of three tiers to a page . War shortages reduced the space for the strip by a third , and later the supplements disappeared completely ; the comic appeared daily in the main newspaper as a four @-@ panel strip . For publication in book form , Casterman insisted that Hergé must adhere to a new album format of four sixteen @-@ page signatures , which gave sixty @-@ two pages of story plus a cover page . Though the format reduced the page count , it maintained the same amount of story by reducing the size of the panels reproduced . As The Shooting Star progressed , Hergé cut up and laid out clippings of the strip in an exercise book in preparation for the new layouts . It was the first volume of The Adventures of Tintin to be originally published in the 62 @-@ page full @-@ colour format that thereafter was the series standard ( as opposed to first being published in a black and white newspaper strip reproduction format that all prior books had done ) . Casterman published the album in September 1942 . Unlike the previous books in the series , because it was printed immediately in colour , it did not need to be totally redrawn . The 176 daily strips from the original serialisation were not enough to fill the 62 pages Casterman had allotted , so Hergé added large panels , such as a half @-@ page panel of a giant telescope on page three . Hergé wanted to include a small gold star inside the " o " of " Étoile " on the cover page , but Casterman refused , deeming it too expensive . 
 In 1954 , Hergé began making various changes to the story for its re @-@ publication . Aware of the controversy surrounding the anti @-@ Semitic depiction of Blumenstein , he renamed the character " Bohlwinkel " , adopting this name from <unk> , a Brussels dialect term for a confectionery store . He later discovered that , by coincidence , Bohlwinkel was also a Jewish name . Trying to tone down the book 's anti @-@ American sentiment , he also changed the United States to a fictional South American nation called São Rico , replacing the U.S. flag flown by the Peary 's crew with that of the fictional state . In 1959 , Hergé made a new list of changes to be made to the artwork in The Shooting Star , which included altering Bohlwinkel 's nose , but the changes were postponed and have never been made . 
 = = Critical analysis = = 
 Pierre Assouline remarked that Hergé 's attention to accuracy lapsed in The Shooting Star . For instance , the meteorite 's approach toward Earth caused a heat wave , while the meteorite itself proceeded to float on the surface of the ocean . In reality , no such heat wave would have been caused , while the meteorite would have plunged to the sea floor , causing a tsunami . He noted that the concept of madness was a recurring theme throughout the story , and that there was " an unreality in the whole adventure " . Fellow biographer Benoît Peeters asserted that The Shooting Star was " of great power and brilliant construction " . Elsewhere , Peeters wrote that the book was " notable for the entry of the fantastic into Hergé 's work " . 
 Jean @-@ Marc and Randy Lofficier deemed the anti @-@ Semitism a " sad moment " in the series , awarding the story one out of five stars . Nevertheless , they felt that the " pre @-@ apocalyptic ambiance is stark and believable " , and that the giant mushrooms on the meteorite were a " strange anticipation " of the mushroom @-@ clouds produced by the atomic bombings in 1945 . Focusing on the characters of Professor Phostle and Philippulus , they asserted that both resembled Sophocles Sarcophagus from Cigars of the Pharaoh and that the former was " in the Jules Verne tradition " of eccentric professors . According to philosopher Pascal Bruckner , Tintin experts find Philippulus a caricature of Marshal of France Philippe Pétain , who demanded the French repent imaginary sins when he took power . Philippe Goddin stated that the strips for this story " kept the reader daily on tenterhooks in a story replete with new twists and humour " . 
 Harry Thompson described The Shooting Star as " the most important of all Hergé 's wartime stories " , having " an air of bizarre fantasy " that was unlike his prior work . He observed that the character of Professor Phostle was a prototype for Professor Calculus , introduced later in the series . Michael Farr asserted that the apocalyptic setting of the story reflected the wartime mood in Europe . He characterises the opening pages of the story as being " unique in [ Hergé 's ] work for the feeling of foreboding they convey " , adding that " Hergé daringly eschews the strip cartoonist 's recognised means of denoting a dream , deliberately confusing the reader " . He felt that the " flow of the narrative is less accomplished " than in other stories , with " spurts and rushes followed by slower passages , upsetting the rhythm and pace " . 
 Literary critic Jean @-@ Marie Apostolidès <unk> The Shooting Star , describing it as " the final attempt of the foundling [ i.e. Tintin ] to rid himself of the bastard [ i.e. Haddock ] and to preserve the integrity of his former values " , pointing out that the first thirteen pages are devoted purely to the boy reporter . He also argued that Phostle and Philippus represent two @-@ halves of " an ambivalent father figure " within the story , with the former prefiguring Calculus " more than any other previous character " . He suggests that when hiding on the Aurora , Philippus can be compared to The Phantom of the Opera , as he steals a stick of dynamite and climbs up the ship 's mast before threatening to detonate the weapon . Apostolidès believed that the shooting star itself is " more a religious mystery than a scientific one " and that Tintin is therefore " the perfect one to figure it out in some religious way — that is , unrealistically " . Apostolidès analysed the political component of the story in terms of " the incarnation of unregulated capitalism against the spirit of European values " , arguing that Hergé was adhering to " a utopian vision that , in 1942 , smacks of pro @-@ German propaganda " . 
 Literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that The Shooting Star represents the apex of the " right @-@ wing strain " in Hergé 's work . He highlighted the instance in which Tintin impersonates God in order to give commands to Philippus as representing one of various occasions in The Adventures of Tintin where " sacred authority manifests itself largely as a voice , and commanding — or commandeering — that voice is what guarantees power " . McCarthy further observes that the image of a giant spider in a ball of fire , which appears near the start of the story , reflects the theme of madness that is again present throughout the series . Discussing the political elements of Hergé 's series , McCarthy also noted that in the original publication of the story , the spider which climbed in front of the observatory telescope and was thus magnified greatly was initially termed <unk> <unk> ; he saw this as an intentional satire of the threat to Europe posed by fascism .

 In 1957 , the animation company Belvision Studios produced a string of colour adaptations based on Hergé 's original comics , adapting eight of the Adventures into a series of daily five @-@ minute episodes .

 In 1991 , a second animated series based upon The Adventures of Tintin was produced , this time as a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana .

Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi , the series has been praised for being " generally faithful " to the original comics , to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Hergé 's original panels . 
 In 2010 , American cartoonist Charles Burns authored X 'ed Out , a graphic novel with a variety of allusions to The Adventures of Tintin . In one scene , the protagonist <unk> discovers a warehouse containing white eggs with red spots , akin to the mushrooms in The Shooting Star , with the cover of Burns ' book paying homage to Hergé .

 = Lake Burley Griffin = 
 Lake Burley Griffin is an artificial lake in the centre of Canberra , the capital of Australia . It was completed in 1963 after the Molonglo River — which ran between the city centre and Parliamentary Triangle — was dammed . It is named after Walter Burley Griffin , the American architect who won the competition to design the city of Canberra . 
 Griffin designed the lake with many geometric motifs , so that the axes of his design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area . However , government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was completed before he left Australia in 1920 . His scheme remained unfulfilled as the Great Depression and World War II intervened , and it was not until the 1950s that planning resumed . After much political dispute over several proposed variations , excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime Minister Robert Menzies . After the completion of the bridges and dams , the dams were locked in September 1963 . However , a drought meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964 . It was formally inaugurated on 17 October 1964 . 
 The lake is located in the approximate geographic centre of the city , and is the centrepiece of the capital in accordance with Griffin 's original designs . Numerous important institutions , such as the National Gallery , National Museum , National Library , Australian National University and the High Court were built on its shores , and Parliament House is a short distance away . Its surrounds , consisting mainly of parklands , are popular with recreational users , particularly in the warmer months . Though swimming in the lake is uncommon , it is used for a wide variety of other activities , such as rowing , fishing , and sailing . 
 The lake is an ornamental body with a length of 11 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) ; at its widest , it measures 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) . It has an average depth of 4 metres ( 13 ft ) and a maximum depth of about 18 metres ( 59 ft ) near the Scrivener Dam . Its flow is regulated by the 33 @-@ metre @-@ tall ( 108 ft ) Scrivener Dam , designed to handle floods that occur once in 5 @,@ 000 years . In times of drought , water levels can be maintained through the release of water from Googong Dam , located on an upstream tributary of the Molonglo River . 
 = = Design history = = 
 Charles Robert Scrivener ( 1855 – 1923 ) recommended the site for Canberra in 1909 , which was to be a planned capital city for the country . One of the reasons for the location 's selection was its ability to store water " for ornamental purposes at reasonable cost " ; Scrivener 's work had demonstrated that the topography could be used to create a lake through flooding . 
 In 1911 , a competition for the design of Canberra was launched , and Scrivener 's detailed survey of the area was supplied to the competing architects . The Molonglo River flowed through the site , which was a flood plain and Scrivener 's survey showed in grey an area clearly representing an artificial lake — similar to the lake later created — and four possible locations for a dam to create it . Most of the proposals took the hint and included artificial bodies of water . 
 = = = Walter Burley Griffin 's design = = = 
 The American architect Walter Burley Griffin won the contest and was invited to Australia to oversee the construction of the nation 's new capital after the judges ' decision was ratified by King O 'Malley , the Minister for Home Affairs . Griffin 's proposal , which had an abundance of geometric patterns , incorporated concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii . 
 His lake design was at the heart of the city and consisted of a Central Basin in the shape of circular segment , a West and East Basin , which were both approximately circular , and a West and East Lake , which were much larger and irregularly shaped , at either side of the system . The East Lake was supposed to be 6 metres ( 20 ft ) higher than the remaining components . Griffin 's proposal was " the grandest scheme submitted , yet it had an appealing simplicity and clarity . 
 The lakes were deliberately designed so that their orientation was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra . The lakes stretched from east to west and divided the city in two ; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretched from Capital Hill — the future location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern side — north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial ( although a casino was originally planned in its place ) . This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill , the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie . At the southwestern end of the land axis was <unk> Peak . 
 The straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin was designated the water axis , and it extended northwest towards Black Mountain , the highest point in Canberra . A line parallel to the water axis , on the northern side of the city , was designated the municipal axis . The municipal axis became the location of Constitution Avenue , which linked City Hill in Civic Centre and Market Centre . Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively , and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin . The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the Parliamentary Triangle , and was to form the centrepiece of Griffin 's work . 
 Later , Scrivener , as part of a government design committee , was responsible for modifying Griffin 's winning design . He recommended changing the shape of the lake from Griffin 's very geometric shapes to a much more organic one using a single dam , unlike Griffin 's series of weirs . Griffin lobbied for the retention of the pure geometry , saying that they were " one of the reasons d 'etre of the ornamental waters " , but he was overruled . The new design included elements from several of the best design submissions and was widely criticised as being ugly . The new plan for the lake retained Griffin 's three formal basins : east , central , and west , though in a more relaxed form . 
 Griffin entered into correspondence with the government over the plan and its alternatives , and he was invited to Canberra to discuss the matter . Griffin arrived in August 1913 and was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction for three years . 
 The plans were varied again in the following years , but the design of Lake Burley Griffin remained based largely on the original committee 's plan . It was later gazetted and legally protected by the federal parliament in 1926 , based on a 1918 plan . However , Griffin had a strained working relationship with the Australian authorities and a lack of federal government funding meant that by the time he left in 1920 , little significant work had been done on the city . A 1920s proposal to reduce West Lake into a ribbon of water was made on the basis of flood safety . However , the Owen and Peake report of 1929 ruled that the original design was <unk> sound . 
 = = = Political disputes and modifications = = = 
 With the onset of the Great Depression , followed by World War II , development of the new capital was slow , and in the decade after the end of the war , Canberra was criticised for resembling a village , and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly . Canberra was often derisively described as " several suburbs in search of a city " . 
 During this time , the Molonglo River flowed through the flood basin , with only a small fraction of the water envisaged in Griffin 's plan . The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland , with small settlements — mostly wooden , temporary and ad hoc — on either side . There was little evidence that Canberra was planned , and the lake and Parliamentary Triangle at the heart of Griffin 's plan was but a paddock . Royal Canberra Golf Course , and Acton Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral land that was to become the West Lake , and people had to disperse the livestock before playing sport . A rubbish dump stood on the northern banks of the location of central basin , and no earth had been moved since Griffin 's departure three decades earlier . 
 In 1950 , the East Lake — the largest component — was eliminated upon the advice of the National Capital Planning and Development Committee ( NCPDC ) . Today , what would have been the East Lake corresponds to the suburb of Fyshwick . The rationale given was that around 1 @,@ 700 acres ( 690 ha ) of farmland would be submerged and that the Molonglo would have insufficient water to keep the lake filled . 
 In 1953 , the NCPDC excised the West Lake from its plans and replaced it with a winding stream , which was 110 metres ( 360 ft ) wide and covered around a fifth of the original area . As the NCPDC had only advisory powers , this change was attributed to the influence of senior officials in the Department of the Interior who felt that Griffin 's plan was too grandiose . Advocates of watered @-@ down scheme thought it was more economical and saved 350 hectares ( 860 acres ) of land for development . However , according to engineering reports that were ignored , the smaller plan would actually cost more money and require a more complicated structure of dams that would in any case be less able to prevent flooding . 
 Initially , there was little opposition during the consultation period before the alterations were made . However , opposition to the reduction of the water area grew . The process that resulted in the alteration was criticised for being non @-@ transparent and sneaky . Some organisations complained that they were not given an opportunity to express their opinion before the change was gazetted , and many politicians and the chief town planner were not informed . Critics bitterly insinuated that politically influential members of the Royal Canberra Golf Club , whose course was situated on the location of the proposed West Lake , were responsible for the change in policy . 
 The Parliamentary Public Works Committee advised the Parliament to restore the West Lake . After an inquiry in late 1954 , it concluded that : 
 The West Lake is desirable and practicable . It was eliminated from the Canberra plan by the Department of the Interior without adequate investigation by the National Capital Planning and Development Committee and replaced by a ribbon of water scheme involving a capitalised cost or nearly 3 million more . The lake should be restored to the plan , and the necessary Ministerial action is recommended as soon as possible . 
 The Prime Minister , Robert Menzies , regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment . Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development . He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city , feeling that their performance lacked intensity . 
 In 1958 , the newly created National Capital Development Commission ( NCDC ) , which had been created and given more power by Menzies following a 1955 Senate inquiry , restored the West Lake to its plans , and it was formally gazetted in October 1959 . The NCDC also blocked a plan by the Department of Works to build a bridge across the lake along the land axis between Parliament House and the War Memorial contrary to Griffin 's plans . 
 A powerful Senate Select Committee oversaw the NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford was brought in to fine @-@ tune Griffin 's original plans . He changed the central basin 's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle ; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore . The result was closer to Scrivener 's modified design some decades earlier .

 The lake contains 33 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 27 @,@ 000 acre · ft ) of water with a surface area of 6 @.@ 64 square kilometres ( 2 @.@ 56 sq mi ) . It is 11 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) long , 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) wide at its widest point , has a shoreline of 40 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 25 @.@ 2 mi ) and a water level of 555 @.@ 93 metres ( 1 @,@ 823 @.@ 9 ft ) above sea level . 
 The lake is relatively shallow ; the maximum depth is 17 @.@ 6 metres ( 58 ft ) near the Scrivener Dam , and the average depth is 4 @.@ 0 metres ( 13 ft ) . The shallowest part of the complex in the East Basin , which has an average depth of 1 @.@ 9 metres ( 6 @.@ 2 ft ) . The minimum depth of the water at the walls is around 0 @.@ 5 metres ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) and rock is placed at the toe of the wall to inhibit aquatic plant growth . 
 Lake Burley Griffin contains six islands , three unnamed small islands and three larger named islands . Of the larger islands , Aspen Island is located in Central Basin while Springbank and Spinnaker Island are located in the West Lake . Aspen Island is connected to dry land by a footbridge , and is the site of the Australian National Carillon . 
 = = Construction = = 
 In 1958 , engineers conducted studies into the hydrology and structural requirements needed for the building of the dam . Further studies were done to model water quality , siltation , climate effects and change in land quality . Modelling based on the data collection suggested that the water level could be kept within a metre of the intended level of 556 metres ( 1 @,@ 824 ft ) above sea level in the case of a flood . 
 In February 1959 , formal authority for beginning construction was granted . However , while Menzies was on holiday , some officials from the Department of Treasury convinced ministers to withhold money needed for the lake , so the start of the construction was delayed . Once it started , progress was fast . At its peak , the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500 . John Overall , the Commissioner of the NCDC , promised Menzies that the work would be finished within four years , and he succeeded , despite the Prime Minister 's scepticism . Equipment was quickly requisitioned . 
 After the lengthy political wrangling over the design had passed , the criticism of the scheme died down . Menzies strongly denounced the " moaning " by opponents of the lake . Most critics decried the project as a waste of money that should have been spent on essential services across Australia . Less strident concerns centred on the potentially negative effects of the lake , such as mosquitoes , ecological degeneration , siltation and the possibility that the lake would create fog . The latter of these concerns has proven to be unfounded . 
 = = = Lakes , islands and foreshore = = = 
 The excavation of Lake Burley Griffin began in 1960 with the clearing of vegetation from the floodplain of the Molonglo River . The trees on the golf course and along the river were pulled up , along with the various sports grounds and houses . 
 During major earthworks , at least 382 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 500 @,@ 000 cu yd ) of topsoil was excavated . It was collected for use at several public parks and gardens , including the future Commonwealth Park on the northern shore . It was also used to create the six artificial islands including Springbank Island . The island was named after the former Springbank Farm that was situated there . Land excavated to create a sailing course at Yarralumla was used for the thematically named Spinnaker Island to its north , while excavated stone was moved beside the Kings Avenue Bridge at the eastern edge of the central basin from Aspen Island . 
 Care was taken to excavate the entire lake floor to a depth of at least 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) to provide sufficient clearance for boat keels . Another reason given for this was that mosquitoes would not breed nor would weeds grow at such a depth . A soil conservation program was launched in the catchment and bed load traps were installed to minimise loss of earth . The traps have been used as a source of sand and gravel for building sites . Drainage blankets were used to prevent the loss of groundwater beneath the lake . 
 During the following phase of work , four types of lake margin were constructed . On the southern side of the Central Basin , low reinforced concrete retaining walls were used , while on the eastern side , grouted rock wall can be seen near Commonwealth Park , as well as much of the East Basin . Sand and gravel beaches were built to cater for lakeside recreational pursuits . These are mostly prevalent on the western half of the lake complex . Rocky outcrops , steeply sloping stable shores with water vegetation such as bullrushes were also used . This treatment is evident in the West Lake in Yarralumla . William Holford and Partners were responsible for the foreshore landscaping , and over 55 @,@ 000 trees were planted in accordance with a detailed scheme . Eucalypts were preferred so as to maintain the natural colour of the city landscape . 
 = = = Bridges = = = 
 Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge ( 310 metres or 1 @,@ 020 feet ) , Kings Avenue Bridge ( 270 metres or 890 feet ) and a roadway over Scrivener Dam . The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled , and replaced wooden structures . 
 Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960 . The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960 , followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after . Fortunately for the builders , Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction . Both bridges use post @-@ tensioned concrete , reinforced with <unk> steel cables . 
 Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual @-@ carriageway ; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two . Instead of traditional lamp post lighting , Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails , a concept known as " integral lighting " . The design was deemed a success , so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also . Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society . 
 Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962 . Prime Minister Menzies unlocked a ceremonial chain before the motorcade and pageant crossed the lake in front of a large crowd . Commonwealth Avenue Bridge opened in 1963 without an official ceremony . Menzies called it " the finest building in the national capital " . 
 = = = Dam = = = 
 The dam that holds back the waters of Lake Burley Griffin was named Scrivener Dam after Charles Robert Scrivener . The dam was designed and built by <unk> Union <unk> in West Germany , and utilised state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art post @-@ tensioning techniques to cope with any problems or movements in the riverbed . This was required because of the quartz porphyry and geological faulting upon which the dam sits . About 55 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 72 @,@ 000 cu yd ) of concrete was used in its construction . The dam is 33 metres ( 108 ft ) high and 319 metres ( 1 @,@ 047 ft ) long with a maximum wall thickness of 19 @.@ 7 metres ( 65 ft ) . The dam is designed to handle a once in 5 @,@ 000 year flood event . Construction began in September 1960 and the dam was locked in September 1963 . 
 The dam has five bay spillway controlled by 30 @.@ 5 metres ( 100 ft ) wide , hydraulically operated fish @-@ belly flap gates . The fish @-@ belly gates allow for a precise control of water level , reducing the dead area on the banks between high and low water levels . The five gates have only been opened simultaneously once in the dam 's history , during heavy flooding in 1976 . The gates hold two thirds of the lake 's volume . They were designed to allow easy flow of debris out of the lake . 
 The dam has the capacity to allow a flow of 5 @,@ 600 cubic metres per second ( 200 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ) but can withstand up to 8 @,@ 600 cubic metres per second ( 300 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ) before " catastrophic damage " results ; A flow of 2 @,@ 830 m3 / s ( 100 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ) can be dealt with without any substantial change in the water level . The highest recorded flow in the Molonglo was 3 @,@ 400 cubic metres per second ( 120 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ) during an earlier flood . 
 Lady Denman Drive , a roadway atop the dam wall , provides a third road crossing for the lake . It consists of a roadway and a bicycle path , and allows residents in western Canberra to cross the lake . This was possible because the dam gates are closed by pushing up from below , unlike most previous designs that wherein the gates were lifted from above . 
 = = = Lake filling = = = 
 A prolonged drought coincided with and eased work on the lake 's construction . The valves on the Scrivener Dam were closed on 20 September 1963 by Minister for the Interior , Gordon Freeth ; Menzies was absent due to ill health . Several months on , with no rain in sight , mosquito @-@ infested pools of water were the only visible sign of the lake filling . With the eventual breaking of the drought , the lake reached the planned level on 29 April 1964 . On 17 October 1964 , Menzies ( by now Sir Robert ) commemorated the filling of the lake and the completion of stage one with an opening ceremony amid the backdrop of sailing craft . The ceremony was accompanied by fireworks display , and Griffin 's lake had finally come to fruition after five decades , at the cost of <unk> . Freeth suggested that Menzies had " been in a material sense the father of the lake " and that the lake should be named after him . Menzies insisted that the lake should be named after Griffin . 
 In times of severe drought , Lake Burley Griffin 's water level can fall unacceptably low . When this happens , a release of water from Googong Dam located upstream can be scheduled to top up and restore the lake water level . The Googong Dam is located on the Queanbeyan River which is a tributary of the Molonglo River . The dam whose construction was finished in 1979 is one of three dams — the Cotter and Corin Dams are the others — that meet the water supply needs of the Canberra and Queanbeyan region . The Googong Dam 's water carrying capacity is 124 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 100 @,@ 900 acre · ft ) . 
 = = Later history and development = = 
 Griffin 's design made the lake a focal point of the city . In the four decades since the initial construction of the lake , various buildings of national importance were added . According to the policy plan of the government , " The lake is not only one of the centrepieces of Canberra 's plan in its own right , but forms the immediate foreground of the National Parliamentary Area . " 
 The creation of the lake also gave a water frontage to many prominent institutions that were previously landlocked . The Royal Canberra Hospital was located on the Acton Peninsula between the West Lake and the West Basin on the north shore until its demolition . Government House , the historic Blundell 's Cottage — which was built over 50 years before construction of Canberra began — and the newly built Australian National University , on the southern and northern shores of the West Lake , both gained a waterfront . 
 In 1970 , two tourist attractions were added to the middle of Central Basin . The Captain James Cook Memorial was built by the government to commemorate the Bicentenary of ( then Lieutenant ) James Cook 's first sighting of the east coast of Australia . It includes a water jet fountain located in the central basin ( based on the Jet d 'eau in Geneva ) and a skeleton globe sculpture at Regatta Point showing the paths of Cook 's expeditions . On 25 April 1970 , Queen Elizabeth II officially inaugurated the memorial . As part of the same ceremony , Queen Elizabeth also opened the National Carillon on Aspen Island , a set of 53 bronze bells donated by the British Government to commemorate the city 's 50th anniversary . 
 The completion of the central basin placed a waterway between Parliament House and the War Memorial and a landscaped boulevard was built along the land axis . Later , various buildings of national importance were built along the land axis in the late @-@ 1960s through to the early 1980s . The National Library was opened on the western side of the axis in April 1968 . Building of the High Court and National Gallery occurred in the late @-@ 1970s and the buildings were opened in May 1980 and October 1982 respectively . The latter two buildings lie on the eastern side of the axis and are connected by an aerial bridge . In 1988 , the new Parliament House was built on Capital Hill , thereby completing the most important structure in the Parliamentary Triangle . 
 The current home of the National Museum was built on the former site of the Royal Canberra Hospital in 2001 . This occurred after the public were encouraged to watch the controlled demolition of the hospital in 1997 , but a girl was killed by flying debris , leading to criticism of the ACT Government . 
 At the start of the 21st century , the layout of the lake was significantly altered for the first time since its construction , through the Kingston <unk> Redevelopment on southern shore of the East Basin , which was planned in 1997 . A bidding process was enacted , multimillion @-@ dollar luxury apartment complexes were built in the suburb of Kingston , driving property values to record @-@ breaking levels . After a dispute over the environmental impact of the development , building works commenced on the previously industrial lakeside area of the suburb . In 2007 , work started to reclaim land from the lakebed to form a harbour . 
 The Kingston Powerhouse , which used to provide the city 's power supply , was converted into the Canberra Glassworks in 2007 , 50 years after the electricity generators stopped . A 25 @-@ metre @-@ high ( 82 ft ) tower of glass and light named Touching Lightly was unveiled on 21 May 2010 by Chief Minister and Minister for the Arts and Heritage Jon Stanhope . It was built by Australian artist Warren Langley . 
 In 2007 , the government unveiled a proposal to redevelop the area surrounding the historic Albert Hall into a tourist and dining precinct . This included the building of an eight @-@ storey building and the rezoning of some waterfront land currently designated as cultural to commercial . It was met with widespread hostility from heritage activists and the general community , which submitted more than 3 @,@ 300 signatories in a petition against the scheme . One of the criticisms was that the project was tilted too heavily towards business , and neglected the arts and community events . The proposal was scrapped in 2009 . 
 It has been proposed that a footbridge , to be named Immigration Bridge , be built between the National Museum of Australia and Lennox Gardens on the south shore , in recognition of the contributions that immigrants have made to Australia . The proposal has mostly received negative feedback . An inquiry recommended that the bridge be redesigned or moved to accommodate the needs of other lake users . 
 = = Lakeside recreation = = 
 The surrounds of Lake Burley Griffin are very popular recreational areas , and is known locally as <unk> . Public parks exist along most of the shore line , with free electric barbecue facilities , fenced @-@ in swimming areas , picnic tables and toilets . These parklands form a large part of the area around the lake , and occupy 3 @.@ 139 km2 ( 776 acres ) in total . Some of the parks reserved for public recreation include Commonwealth , Weston , Kings and Grevillea Parks , Lennox Gardens and Commonwealth Place . Commonwealth and Kings Park on the northern shore of the Central Basin are among the two most popular . The former is an urban horticultural park and is the location of the Canberra Festival . Commonwealth Park is the location of <unk> , an annual flower festival that is held for around a month in spring and attracts upwards of 300 @,@ 000 visitors , a number comparable to the city population . The largest flower festival in Australia , the event is a major tourist attraction for the city , and legal action was threatened after another festival in Australia wanted to use the same name . An expansion is being planned to coincide with the centenary of the national capital . The Weston Park to the west is known for its woodland and conifers , while Black Mountain Peninsula is known as a picnicking site with eucalypts . Grevillea and Bowen Parks on the East Basin tend to be little used . 
 Owing to the proliferation of beaches , boat ramps and jetties , the West Lake is the area most used by swimmers and vessels . A bike path also surrounds the lake , and riding , walking or jogging around the lake are a popular activity on the weekends . Fireworks are often held over the lake on New Year 's Eve , and a large show called Skyfire has been held at the lake since 1989 . 
 = = = Water sports = = = 
 Lake Burley Griffin , apart from being ornamental , is used for many recreational activities . Canoeing , sailing , <unk> , windsurfing and dragon boating are popular . A rowing course is set up at the western end of the lake . The National Championships were held in the lake in 1964 , but high winds have deterred organisers . On one occasion , winds swept a boat into a bridge pylon . While not particularly popular , opportunities for swimming have been limited recently because of increasingly frequent lake closures due to concerns about water quality ; another deterrent against swimming is the generally cold water temperature . During summer , the lake is used for the swim leg of numerous triathlon and <unk> events including the Sri <unk> Triathlon Festival . 
 Generally , powerboat use on the lake is not permitted . Permits are available for the use of powered boats on the lake for use in rescue , training , commercial purposes or special interest ( such as historic steam powered boats ) . Molonglo Reach , an area of the Molonglo River just before it enters the east basin is set aside for water skiing . Ten powerboats may be used in this limited area . 
 = = = Safety = = = 
 The lake is patrolled by the Australian Federal Police water police . The water police give assistance to lake users , helping to right boats and towing crippled craft to shore . 
 At most swimming locations around Lake Burley Griffin there are fenced @-@ in swimming areas for safety . In the more popular areas , there are also safety lockers with life belts and emergency phones for requesting help . Between 1962 and 1991 , seven people died from drowning . 
 For safety and water quality reasons , the lake has different zones for different activities . The eastern extremity is zoned for primary contact water activities such as swimming and water skiing . The East and Central Basins , closer to populated areas , are zoned for secondary contact water sports such as sailing or rowing . West Lake and Tarcoola Reach , which covers the area between Commonwealth Avenue and Kurrajong Point , is the primary recreational area of the lake , and both primary and secondary contact water sports are permitted . <unk> Reach near Scrivener Dam has a marked rowing course , and is zoned as secondary , although primary contact activities are also allowed . 
 = = Environmental issues = = 
 = = = Water quality = = = 
 Toxic blue @-@ green algae blooms are a reasonably common occurrence in the lake . Warnings about coming into contact with the water are released when an algal bloom is detected . Attempts are being made to limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality . Blue @-@ green algae ( more correctly cyanobacteria ) produce toxins , which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water . There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water . 
 The water also appears murky due to a high level of turbidity ; however , this is not usually a health risk . However , the turbidity , which is caused by wind , prevents photosynthetic stabilisation . Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin , but dredging is not required . The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong Dam , and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded , partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream . However , leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution . Rubbish , oil and sediment traps have been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution . 
 = = = Aquatic life and fishing = = = 
 Fishing and duck hunting is quite popular in the lake . The most common species caught is the illegally introduced carp . Annual monitoring is carried out to determine fish populations . However , a number of less common species also inhabit the lake , including native Murray cod , western carp gudgeon and silver perch , as well as introduced goldfish , <unk> , rainbow trout and brown trout . 
 The lake has been stocked annually with a variety of introduced and native species and over half a million fish have been released since 1981 . There have been many changes to the fish populations in the lake as well as stocking practices since it was first filled . 
 Regular stocking since the start of the 1980s have re @-@ established reasonable populations of golden perch and Murray cod ; native fish that were indigenous to the Molonglo River before the lake was built , but had been lost to mining pollution of the Molonglo River in the first half of the 20th century . The main reason for stocking is to boost fish stocks along the Molonglo , which have been depleted by overfishing , introduced species and habitat destruction . One of the motives for raising the level of Murray cod and golden perch is to balance the ecosystem by having them act as native predators of other fish . 
 Silver perch and brown trout were released in 1981 – 83 and 1987 – 89 respectively , but have not been stocked since . Rainbow trout have been released sporadically , approximately once a decade , but have not been released since 2002 – 04 , due to unacceptably low survival rates . According to a government report , the reason for the low survival rate is unknown , but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one prominent theory . Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years . The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014 . 
 = Hugh de Neville = 
 Hugh de Neville ( died 1234 ; sometimes Hugh Neville ) was the Chief Forester under the kings Richard I , John , and Henry III of England . He was also the sheriff for a number of counties over his lifetime . Related to a number of other royal officials as well as a bishop , Neville was a member of Prince Richard 's household . After Richard became king in 1189 , Neville continued in his service and he accompanied him on the Third Crusade . Neville remained in the royal service following Richard 's death in 1199 and the accession of King John to the throne , becoming one of the new king 's favourites and often gambling with him . He was named in Magna Carta as one of John 's principal advisors , considered by a medieval chronicler to be one of King John 's " evil councillors " . He deserted John after the French invasion of England in 1216 , but returned to pledge his loyalty to John 's son Henry III after the latter 's accession to the throne later that year . Neville 's royal service continued until his death in 1234 , though by then he was a less significant figure than he had been at the height of his powers . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Neville was the son of Ralph de Neville , a son of Alan de Neville , who was also Chief Forester . Hugh had a brother , Roger de Neville , who was part of Hugh 's household from 1202 to 1213 , when Roger was given custody of Rockingham Castle by King John . Another brother was William , who was given some of Hugh 's lands in 1217 . Hugh , Roger , and William were related to a number of other royal officials and churchmen , most notable among them Geoffrey de Neville , who was a royal chamberlain , and Ralph Neville , who became Bishop of Chichester . Hugh de Neville employed Ralph de Neville at the start of Ralph 's career , and the two appear to have remained on good terms throughout the rest of Hugh 's life . 
 Hugh de Neville was a member of the household of Prince Richard , later Richard I , and also served Richard 's father , King Henry II at the end of Henry 's reign , administering two baronies for the king . Neville accompanied Richard on the Third Crusade ; he was one of the few knights who fought with the king on 5 August 1192 outside the walls of Jaffa , when the king and a small force of knights and crossbowmen fought off a surprise attack by Saladin 's forces . It was famously reported that during the engagement Saladin sent Richard two remounts in the thick of battle , so that Richard would not be forced to fight on foot . Neville 's account of events was a source for the chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall 's entries on Richard 's activities in the Third Crusade . 
 In 1194 Neville acquired the wardship of Joan de Cornhill , daughter of Henry de Cornhill , and married her four years later . Also in 1194 he was given custody of the town of Marlborough in Wiltshire , and in 1196 was appointed as Sheriff of Oxfordshire . He was also named in 1197 as Sheriff of Essex and Sheriff of Hertfordshire , offices he held until some time in 1200 . 
 = = Chief Forester = = 
 Neville was appointed as Chief Forester under King Richard I in 1198 . As the official in charge of the royal forests , he was one of the four great officers of the state : the others were the justiciar , the chancellor , and the treasurer . The forester was responsible for enforcing the forest law – the special law that applied to the royal forests – and presided over the forest justices , who held forest eyres . There was also a special forest exchequer , or forest treasury . In 1198 Neville presided over an Assize of the Forest that was described by the chronicler Roger of Howden as greatly oppressive . The revenues could be considerable ; in 1198 the forest eyre brought in £ 1 @,@ 980 . Neville stated in 1208 that over the previous six and a half years the amount raised by the various revenues of the forests had been £ 15 @,@ 000 ; in 1212 it had been £ 4 @,@ 486 . Forest law was resented by the king 's subjects , not just for its severity but also because of the large extent of the kingdom that it encompassed . It covered not just woodlands , but by the end of the 12th century it covered between a quarter and a third of the whole kingdom . This extent enabled the Norman and Angevin kings to use the harsh punishments of forest law to extract large sums of money for their government . 
 Neville continued to hold the office of Chief Forester under King John and he was often the king 's gambling partner . He was a frequent witness to John 's royal charters . Under John , Neville was named to the offices of Sheriff of Hampshire in 1210 , and Sheriff of Cumberland , offices of which he was deprived in 1212 . He was also reappointed to the <unk> of Essex and Hertfordshire in 1202 , holding them until 1203 . 
 In 1210 King John fined Neville 1 @,@ 000 marks because he had allowed Peter des Roches , the Bishop of Winchester , to enclose some hunting grounds without royal permission ; although Roches was close to the king , his action was an infringement of the royal forests . Neville 's large fine was probably a warning that the king was serious about enforcing the forest law , but it was eventually rescinded . In 1213 Neville was placed in charge of the seaports along the English coast from Cornwall to Hampshire , but some time in 1213 it appears that he fell from royal favour , although the circumstances are unknown . A fine of 6 @,@ 000 marks was assessed on him for allowing two prisoners to escape , as well as other unrecorded offences , although the king did subsequently remit 1 @,@ 000 marks of the fine . In 1215 Neville lost his office of chief forester . Neville was present at Runnymede for the signing of Magna Carta and was mentioned in the preamble as one of King John 's councillors , as well as serving as a witness to the document . Roger of Wendover , a chronicler writing in 1211 , listed Neville as one of King John 's " evil councillors " . 
 = = John 's later reign and service under King Henry III = = 
 John 's style of ruling , and his defeats in continental Europe in 1214 , had alienated many of his nobles . Initially , a faction of the barons forced John to agree to Magna Carta to secure less capricious government from the king . John , however , after agreeing to their demands , secured the annulment of the charter from the papacy in late 1215 . The opposition magnates then invited Prince Louis of France to take the English throne , and Louis arrived in England with an army in May 1216 . 
 Neville joined the rebel barons in 1216 , shortly after Prince Louis invaded England . Neville surrendered Marlborough Castle , a royal castle in his custody , to Prince Louis in mid @-@ 1216 . Louis had not besieged the castle , and it appears that Neville took the initiative in making overtures to the prince . When John heard of the change of sides , he confiscated all of Neville 's lands held directly from the king on 8 July 1216 . On 4 September 1216 the king further confiscated lands belonging to other rebels that had been granted to Neville before the surrender of Marlborough ; some were re @-@ granted to Neville 's brother William . Hugh de Neville 's son , Herbert , also joined the rebels . 
 After King John 's death in October 1216 , Neville and his son made their peace with the new king , Henry III , John 's son . Both men had their lands restored in 1217 , but the offices that the elder Neville had held were not returned quickly . Custody of some royal forests was returned by 1220 , but the office of Chief Forester was not returned until some time later . In 1218 Neville was supposed to have had the forest of Rockingham returned to his custody , but William de Forz , the Count of Aumale , refused to return it . It was not until 1220 that de Neville managed to recover his custody of Rockingham forest . By 1224 Neville was once more Chief Forester , but he never regained the power and influence that he had held under John . When he lost the office for the second time is unclear . The historian C. R. Young states that he held the office until his death in 1234 when it passed to his son John , but Daniel Crook , writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography , claims that Neville lost the forester office in 1229 , to be replaced by John of Monmouth and Brian de Lisle . He also served as Sheriff of Lincolnshire . 
 = = Records and lands = = 
 Neville 's household records for 1207 survive , detailing his itinerary for the year ; in one eight @-@ week period his household visited 11 different towns . In 1204 his wife offered the king 200 chickens for the right to sleep one night with her husband , an obligation recorded in the royal records . The historian Daniel Crook suggests that this shows that Joan Neville was one of the barons ' wives who attracted King John 's sexual attentions . 
 Neville inherited lands in Lincolnshire worth one half of a knight 's fee . These were augmented with gifts from Richard and John , much of which were in Essex . He also acquired lands in Surrey and in Somerset , and his marriage to Joan brought him estates in Essex . Joan 's lands also brought him into conflict with Falkes de Breauté , the husband of Joan 's younger sister and co @-@ heiress , and the two brothers @-@ in @-@ law were involved in lawsuits over their wives ' lands for more than five years . Joan and her sister were also co @-@ heiresses to the barony of Courcy , in right of their mother Alice de Courcy . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Neville 's first wife , Joan de Cornhill , died after December 1224 . Some time before April 1230 he married secondly Beatrice , the widow of Ralph de Fay and one of the five daughters of Stephen of Turnham . Joan and Neville had at least three sons – John , Henry , and Herbert . Neville also had a daughter named Joan . 
 Neville died in 1234 , although his death was incorrectly recorded by Matthew Paris as occurring in 1222 . Neville was buried at Waltham Abbey , of which he had been a patron . Besides Waltham , he also made gifts to Christ Church Priory in Canterbury , <unk> Priory in Lincolnshire , and St Mary 's Nunnery , Clerkenwell . The historian Sidney Painter said of Neville 's career during John 's reign that " a strong argument could be advanced for the thesis that the royal official who wielded the most actual power during John 's reign was the chief forester , Hugh de Neville " . Another historian , J. R. Maddicott , states that Neville was head of " one of the most detested branches of royal administration " .

 Knight was a student of Anglo @-@ Chinese School . In the 1990s , he was the vice @-@ chairman of its Old Boys ' Association and a member of its board of governors . He obtained his bachelor of laws degree from the National University of Singapore in the 1960s , and played the guitar in a jazz band to raise money for his tuition fees . 
 He joined the Singapore Legal Service in 1970 and rose through the ranks " with the speed and power of an Exocet missile , " as Queen 's Counsel Roy <unk> later described it . Soon he acquired a reputation for being a law enforcer who prosecuted criminals without fear or favour . News of his ability and integrity impressed the late David Marshall , so much that when he retired he offered to give Knight a full partnership in his law firm ; however , Knight was content to remain in the Legal Service and declined the offer . 
 Knight is married to <unk> <unk> . The couple have no children .

 In 1978 , Knight was the deputy public prosecutor in the trial of former magistrate Khoo Hin <unk> . In 1983 , he acted for the Prosecution again in the trial of Adrian Lim , who had murdered two children . In 1985 , he was the senior state counsel and deputy public prosecutor who filed an affidavit on behalf of the Attorney @-@ General requesting that the High Court cite five defendants for contempt of court over an editorial published in the Asian Wall Street Journal ( <unk> ) on 17 October 1985 . Titled " Jeyaretnam 's Challenge " , the editorial had questioned the " integrity and impartiality " of Singapore 's judicial system . The affidavit led to an apology from the editor of the <unk> . In 1986 , he was the public prosecutor for the Commercial Affairs Investigation Department who filed charges against key people in Pan Electric Industries ( " Pan @-@ El " ) , such as Tan Kok Liang , Tan Koon Swan , and Peter Tham , in the aftermath of the company 's collapse . For his role in the Pan @-@ El investigations , Knight was commended by then @-@ Finance Minister Richard Hu in 1989 . Knight also led the prosecution team in Singapore 's first case of insider trading , that of former United Overseas Bank banker Allan Ng . On National Day 1990 ( 9 August 1990 ) , he was awarded the Public Administration Medal , Gold , for his work as Director of the Commercial Affairs Department . 
 = = First investigation and trial = = 
 On 23 March 1991 , Knight was suddenly replaced as CAD director by Senior State Counsel Lawrence Ang in a decision that shocked the local legal community . It turned out that Knight was under investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau ( CPIB ) . After an investigation lasting more than two months — one of the longest probes into the conduct of a public servant in Singapore — Knight was arrested on 27 May 1991 and charged with corruption the next day . He was the first Singapore legal officer to face such charges . Specifically , he was accused of cheating three businessmen into investing S $ 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 each into the former Batam Island Country Club on the Indonesian island of Batam , as well as giving false information to the CPIB regarding vehicle purchases , an application for a car loan , and his corporate investments . The judge originally set Knight 's trial to commence in October 1992 , but changed his mind and brought it forward to September 1991 after the prosecution complained that its witnesses had been subject to intimidation , and investigating officers had received mysterious phone calls warning them to " watch out " . In July that year , his wife and two others were also arrested and charged over the Batam resort investments . 
 In a district court on 29 September 1991 , Knight pleaded guilty to cheating then managing director of Trans @-@ Island Bus Services Ng Ser Miang to try to make him invest in the Batam resort project , which had been planned by Knight and his wife . In October , he was sentenced to three months in prison . 
 Knight appealed against the sentence , and in March 1992 he managed to get his sentence reduced to a $ 17 @,@ 000 fine and a day in prison . He served the jail sentence and paid the fine on the day it was announced . In deciding to reduce the sentence , High Court Judge L.P. Thean said that a " nominal custodial sentence " was sufficient given the mitigating circumstances in Knight 's case . In April , all charges against his wife in relation to his case were also dropped . 
 = = Aftermath of first conviction = = 
 Although the sentence meted to him was eventually reduced , the corruption case had left permanent damage on Knight 's career as a civil servant . After investigations on him began in March 1991 , he faced disciplinary hearings and his services were terminated on 26 March 1992 . The President also revoked the prestigious Public Administration Medal , Gold , that had been awarded to Knight . In August 1994 , the High Court struck Knight off the roll of advocates and solicitors , meaning that he could no longer practise law . After being disbarred , Knight worked as a consultant in a public @-@ listed company .

 In 1998 , Knight was again charged in court — this time with criminal breach of trust by misappropriating money totalling $ 4 @,@ 200 when still the CAD 's Director on two occasions , in 1989 and 1990 . This second charge caused Knight to resign from his job . 
 During the trial , the defence argued that the proceedings were invalid as Knight had been granted immunity by the Attorney @-@ General 's Chambers in 1991 from further charges arising from his corruption investigations , in exchange for him to plead guilty in the earlier trial . They argued that the latest set of charges stemmed from that investigation and thus were subject to the immunity clause . The CPIB revealed that it had been tipped off about the misappropriation of money only in 1997 by an unnamed informant . The court ruled that the proceedings could continue because the 1991 probe into Knight 's dealings did not investigate his misappropriation of money . Eventually the court found him guilty of two charges of misappropriation and sentenced him to a $ 10 @,@ 000 fine and another day in jail .

 = Action of 24 October 1798 = 
 The Action of 24 October 1798 was a minor naval engagement of the French Revolutionary Wars , fought between a British Royal Navy frigate and two ships of the Batavian Republic . The Dutch ships were intercepted in the North Sea within hours of leaving port , 30 nautical miles ( 56 km ) northwest of the Texel , by the British ship HMS Sirius . Both Dutch vessels were carrying large quantities of military supplies and French soldiers , reinforcements for the French and Irish forces participating in the Irish Rebellion of 1798 . Although the rebellion had been defeated a month earlier , word of the British victory had not yet reached the European continent , and the Dutch force was intended to supplement a larger French squadron sent earlier in October . The French had already been defeated at the Battle of Tory Island and the Dutch suffered a similar outcome , both ships defeated in turn by the larger and better armed British vessel . 
 Captain Richard King on Sirius discovered the Dutch ships early on 24 October , when they were separated by 2 nautical miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) and thus unable to mutually support one another . Targeting the smaller ship , Waakzaamheid , King was able to outrun her in an hour and force her to surrender without a fight . Turning his attention on the larger vessel , Furie , King rapidly overhauled her as well and opened a heavy fire , to which Furie was only able to ineffectively reply . Within half an hour she too had surrendered . Both ships were taken to Britain , repaired and commissioned in the Royal Navy . The defeat ended the last effort by the continental nations to land soldiers in Ireland , and signified the last action of the Irish Rebellion . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the French Revolution in 1789 , a political organisation was formed in Ireland named the Society of United Irishmen . Crossing social and religious boundaries , this organisation embraced republican principles with the stated goal of removing British government control from Ireland . When Britain went to war with the French Republic in 1793 , the organisation was declared illegal and driven under cover , many of its senior members going into exile in Europe or America . These men continued to call for armed resistance to the British government , and in 1796 persuaded the French Directory to launch the Expédition d 'Irlande , a large scale invasion of Ireland . The expedition was a disaster , with thousands of French soldiers drowned without a single man successfully landed . Subsequently the French @-@ controlled government of the Batavian Republic , formerly the Dutch Republic , was persuaded to make an attempt on Ireland in October 1797 , but their fleet was intercepted and defeated by Admiral Adam Duncan at the Battle of Camperdown . 
 In May 1798 , the arrest of a number of the leaders of the United Irishmen provoked the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , a widespread uprising across Ireland . The Rebellion took the British authorities by surprise , but the introduction of regular British Army troops rapidly defeated the Irish armies and the last resistance was brought to an end in September with the surrender of a small French force at the Battle of Ballinamuck . The French authorities had also been taken by surprise by the uprising , and were consequently unprepared : the forces they deployed were inadequate to face the much larger British armies operating in Ireland at the time . News of this defeat had still not reach the continent by October , when a second French invasion force set out . Closely watched by the Royal Navy as soon as it left Brest , the squadron was defeated on 12 October 1798 at the Battle of Tory Island : fewer than a third of the French ships returned to France . 
 The Dutch had also been persuaded to send reinforcements to the United Irishmen during the rebellion , but like the French they were unprepared for the sudden uprising and their contributions were not ready until 24 October . Two Dutch ships had been ordered to take on troops and supplies : the 36 @-@ gun frigate Furie under Captain Bartholomeus Pletz and the 24 @-@ gun corvette Waakzaamheid under Captain Meindert van Neirop , who assumed command of the expedition . Although both ships were small and poorly armed , each carried a number of French soldiers for service in Ireland , Furie embarking 165 and Waakzaamheid 122 . In addition , the ships carried over 6 @,@ 000 stands of arms and large quantities of other military stores with which to arm the Irish irregular forces that they expected to meet . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Departing on the night of 23 / 24 October , the Dutch ships made rapid progress and at 08 : 00 were 30 nautical miles ( 56 km ) northwest of the Texel , sailing westwards towards the English Channel . Within sight of the Dutch ships however was the British frigate HMS Sirius , a new ship of 1 @,@ 049 long tons ( 1 @,@ 066 t ) , rated as 38 @-@ guns but actually carrying 44 . She was commanded by Captain Richard King , who had participated in the campaign against the Expédition d 'Irlande two years earlier . Sirius had been stationed off the Texel to watch for Dutch movements and intercept any ships of smaller or equal size entering or leaving the waterway . Although van Neirop 's squadron outnumbered King 's ship , the British vessel was much larger and faster , and the Dutch were also hampered by their position : the two ships were more than 2 nautical miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) apart , too far to offer mutual support against their opponent . 
 King 's first target was the smaller and slower Waakzaamheid , which was windward of Furie and thus would have to sail into the wind to link with Pletz 's ship . King rapidly closed with the corvette , avoiding contact with the larger Furie as he did so . At 09 : 00 Sirius came alongside Waakzaamheid and fired a gun at her , prompting van Neirop to immediately surrender . Furie had not attempted to come to the flagship 's aid and resistance against the much larger Sirius would have been futile . King despatched boats containing a prize crew and removed most of the prisoners from Waakzaamheid , placing them below decks on Sirius . Once the prize was secure , King immediately set off in pursuit of Furie , which was attempting to flee to the west and had nearly disappeared over the horizon . For the rest of the day the pursuit continued , Furie unable to escape the faster British ship , which steadily gained during the afternoon until at 17 : 00 was within range of the Dutch frigate . 
 King 's fire was heavy , but Pletz resisted , responding with his own cannon and continuing his attempts to escape . For half an hour the engagement continued , the distance between the ships varying as Pletz attempted to manoeuvre out of King 's range . The British crew were better gunners than the Dutch , and the musketry of the French soldiers aboard had little effect on Sirius as the range between the ships was too great for muskets to be effective . As a result , damage and casualties mounted aboard Furie although Sirius was barely touched , only one shot striking the bowsprit and one man wounded . At approximately 17 : 30 , Pletz surrendered , having lost eight dead and 14 wounded and with his ship badly damaged . King transferred the prisoners and placed a prize crew on Furie before returning to his base at the Nore with his prizes . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The capture of the Dutch ships was the end of the final attempt by a continental nation to land troops in Ireland during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars that followed them . Furie and Waakzaamheid were both purchased for the Royal Navy , Furie returned to her pre @-@ war name of Wilhelmina and Waakzaamheid under the same name . The corvette was regraded and the number of guns aboard were reduced to 20 as her frame was not deemed strong enough to carry 24 . Richard King remained in Sirius until 1802 , and subsequently commanded the ship of the line HMS Achille , participating at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 .

 Menace is a side @-@ scrolling shooter video game developed by DMA Design and published by Psygnosis . It was originally released for the Amiga in 1988 , and was ported for the Atari ST , Commodore 64 and DOS in 1989 . The game is set on the planet of Draconia , where players are tasked with destroying the planet 's defence mechanisms in order to kill the harmful creatures . 
 The game was designed by David Jones , and was the first game developed by his company DMA Design . First developed in his bedroom at his parents ' house , Jones began seeking an official development studio and publisher when the game was nearing completion . He eventually settled upon a publishing deal with Psygnosis , who first published the game in 1988 to positive reviews ; praise was given to the game 's graphics , sound and gameplay , while criticism was directed at its ports to inferior hardware . The game was also commercially successful , selling over 20 @,@ 000 copies . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Menace is a horizontal side @-@ scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics . Players control a powerful alien space fighter , moving through six stages on the planet of Draconia to advance through the game . Players use the ship 's weaponry — lasers and cannons — to attack all advancing enemies , and defeat the level 's boss : a guardian of Draconia . The six bosses act as Draconia 's living defence mechanisms — the planet was created to habituate gruesome and harmful creatures , of which there are over sixty , participating in unlawful tasks . In the game 's levels , players discover space debris , which can be converted into upgrades for the ship . The debris appears as tokens , and grants players additional weapons and upgrades , such as lasers , cannons , and improved ship and weapon power . The ship also has a shield , which provides temporary protection from enemies ; contact with enemies and walls depletes the shields , increasing players ' vulnerability to death . 
 = = Development and release = = 
 DMA Design was founded in 1987 by David Jones , Russell Kay , Steve Hammond and Mike Dailly , in Dundee , Scotland . Originally working under the name Acme Software , they began developing games for the Commodore 64 and Amiga . Jones began developing Menace under the working title <unk> , in his bedroom at his parents ' house . He was attending the Dundee Institute of Technology at the time . To publish the game in 1988 , Jones first approached Hewson Consultants , where Andrew <unk> played the game and recommended it to Hewson . When Jones was informed that Hewson wanted the game to be the " Amiga version of <unk> " , he realised that sales would be limited , and refused to sign the contract ; despite this , Hewson had already promoted the game in Popular Computing Weekly , before the deal was officially dropped . After signing a publishing deal with Psygnosis , Acme Software was renamed DMA Design . 
 Tony Smith worked on some of the game 's backgrounds and graphics , while Jones designed the levels . Jones decided for Menace to be a side @-@ scrolling game after playing arcade games such as Nemesis ( 1985 ) and R @-@ Type ( 1987 ) . Psygnosis could not decide a preference for the design of the player ship ; as a result , Smith often re @-@ designed the ship with many variations . The team found difficulty porting the game to the Atari ST , due to the hardware 's limitations with smooth scrolling . Brian " Biscuit " Watson , who the team met at a computer club in 1984 , discovered a technique to overcome this difficulty . Other limitations included the fewer colours available with the hardware ; Smith adapted his designs accordingly . After completing his own game , Kay was assigned to port Menace to PC . During development , the sound effects were temporarily replaced with those from Salamander ( 1986 ) ; Jones recorded the sound effects from the game , as Hammond and Dailly played . Prior to this , the temporary sound effects consisted of noises by Jones . The game 's final sound effects were designed by musician David Whittaker . The cover art was designed by Ian Craig . 
 At the end of development , the game was known as Draconia , before being renamed to Menace shortly before release , upon discovering that another game had the same title . It was published in 1988 for the Amiga , and in 1989 for the Atari ST , Commodore 64 and DOS . The game generated a considerable amount of money for DMA Design , allowing the company to develop more games . The game sold 20 @,@ 000 copies , reportedly generating around £ 20 @,@ 000 .
