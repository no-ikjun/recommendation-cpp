 = Mitchell Freeway = 
 Mitchell Freeway is a 30 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 19 mi ) freeway in the northern suburbs of Perth , Western Australia , linking central Perth with the satellite city of Joondalup . It is the northern section of State Route 2 , which continues south as Kwinana Freeway and Forrest Highway . Along its length are interchanges with several major roads , including Graham Farmer Freeway and Reid Highway . The southern terminus of the Mitchell Freeway is at the Narrows Bridge , which crosses the Swan River , and the northern terminus is at Burns Beach Road , which is the northern border of the suburb of Joondalup . 
 Planning for the route began in the 1950s , and the first segment in central Perth was constructed between 1967 and 1973 . The Mitchell Freeway has been progressively extended north since then . In the 1970s , the first two extensions were completed , up to Hutton Street in Osborne Park . By the end of the 1980s , the freeway had reached Ocean Reef Road in Edgewater . The Joondalup railway line was constructed in the freeway median in the early 1990s . This necessitated the relocation of a section of the southbound carriageway , and the construction of three new bridges . In conjunction with these works , additional lanes were constructed in the realigned section . 
 Since the 1990s , extensions to the Mitchell Freeway have taken it to Burns Beach Road at the northern edge of Joondalup . During 2013 , two sections of the northbound carriageway will be widened with an additional lane . The State Government have announced that the next extension will be to Hester Avenue , to be constructed between 2014 – 15 and 2016 – 17 . Further works are planned , which will take the freeway past Yanchep and Two Rocks to the boundary of the Perth Metropolitan Region .

 The Mitchell Freeway is the northern section of State Route 2 . It commences at the northern end of the Narrows Bridge , Perth , continuing from Kwinana Freeway , and terminates just north of the satellite city of Joondalup at Burns Beach Road , <unk> . All intersections with the freeway are via grade separated interchanges . The speed limit is 100 kilometres per hour ( 60 mph ) except in central Perth , where the limit is reduced to 80 kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) as the freeway interchanges with Graham Farmer Freeway and Mounts Bay Road . South of Hepburn Avenue , the freeway has 3 to 5 lanes in each direction . From that point north , there are mostly two lanes in each direction , expanding to three lanes between Hodges Drive and Shenton Avenue . The median strip of the freeway also houses the Joondalup railway line , with all but two of the line 's stations also built on the strip . Additionally , a shared pedestrian and bicycle path is built alongside most of the freeway .

 The section near the Perth city centre , within the City of Perth local government area ( LGA ) , features many partial access interchanges . The Narrows Interchange is located just north of the Narrows Bridge , on the eastern edge of Kings Park . This is a hybrid interchange connecting the freeway with Mounts Bay Road and Riverside Drive , over a distance of 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) . There is complete access to and from Mounts Bay Road via a standard northbound exit ramp and looped ramps for the other movements . There is a partial Y @-@ Interchange incorporated for direct access to and from Riverside Drive via a southbound exit ramp and a northbound entrance ramp . All other traffic movements must be made via Mounts Bay Road . The Riverside Drive entrance ramp merges with the Mounts Bay Road northbound entrance ramp . The southbound exit ramp is similarly shared , before diverging for three destinations : Mounts Bay Road , Riverside Drive , and the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre car park . The main northbound exit to Hay Street is via an access road , which begins on the Mounts Bay Road exit ramp . The access road rejoins the freeway as an outside lane on the shared Riverside Drive and Mounts Bay Road entrance ramp . The Hay Street exit ramp , a short distance later , can be accessed from the two outermost lanes . This allows the traffic entering the freeway from the ramp to continue north or exit at Hay Street without weaving . 
 The freeway continues north @-@ westerly for 240 metres ( 790 ft ) , splitting Mount Street in half , and passing under Malcolm Street . After this , it turns north @-@ easterly for 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) , and lines up with the city blocks between George and Elder streets , a pair of one way frontage roads . The freeway also marks the boundary between Perth and West Perth . Partial access is provided to or from all the roads that the freeway crosses over ( or under in the case of Hay Street ) , with the exception of Roe Street . North of Roe Street , the freeway turns north @-@ west towards Glendalough over the course of 1 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 68 mi ) . In this section the freeway marks the boundary between the City of Perth and City of Vincent LGAs . There is a full Y @-@ Interchange here with Graham Farmer Freeway , which bypasses the Perth city centre via a tunnel , and provides access to Perth Airport . Combined with this interchange is a partial Y @-@ Interchange with Charles Street . The southbound entrance ramp merges with , and northbound exit ramp diverges from , the Graham Farmer Freeway ramps . There is a traffic light controlled intersection with Newcastle Street at the northern end of these ramps . Charles Street is the start of State Route 60 , an alternative route to Perth 's northern suburbs and areas north of the Perth Metropolitan Region . Located in the vicinity of these interchanges are the Sutherland Street northbound entrance ramp , from West Perth , and a southbound exit ramp to both James Street , Northbridge , and Wellington Street , Perth . The Loftus Street overpass , near the northwestern end of the Graham Farmer Freeway ramps , is the edge of the City of Perth LGA ; beyond this point the freeway is the boundary between West Leederville in the Town of Cambridge and Leederville in the City of Vincent . 
 = = = Northern suburbs of Perth = = = 
 In the northern suburbs of Perth , most of the interchanges are standard diamond interchanges , and the rest are modified versions , which have ramps missing or replaced with loop ramps . The first interchange 0 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 56 mi ) north @-@ west of West Perth , is with Vincent Street and Lake Monger Drive . This interchange has a looped southbound entry ramp , so that Leederville Parade can join to the south side of intersection with Vincent Street and the southbound ramps . The northbound exit ramp terminates at Southport Street , 200 metres ( 660 ft ) south of Vincent Street and Lake Monger Drive . The freeway then proceeds northwest for 1 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) alongside Lake Monger 's eastern edge , after which there is a half diamond interchange with Powis Street , with only a northbound exit ramp and a southbound entrance ramp . The freeway continues north , now within the City of Stirling LGA , through Osborne Park , until it reaches Hutton Street after 2 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 5 mi ) . The are several local roads in Osborne Park that have T @-@ Junction intersections with the freeway ramps south of Hutton Street . These are McDonald Street West and Hector Street West , with the northbound exit ramp ; and Cape Street , Hector Street , and McDonald Street with southbound entry ramps . The freeway has an 3 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) S @-@ curve after Hutton Street , moving to an alignment further west that does not bisect any suburbs . The interchanges with Cedric Street on the S @-@ curve , and Karrinyup Road at the end of the S @-@ curve , are diamond interchanges . There are slight modifications to the entrance and exit ramps between these roads , which merge for 500 metres ( 0 @.@ 31 mi ) , requiring traffic to weave . The curved section is the boundary between Stirling to the east of the freeway , and Osborne Park and <unk> to the west . 
 The next interchange , after 1 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) , is with Erindale Road . It is another half diamond interchange , with only northbound exit and southbound entrance ramps . Beyond Erindale Road , the suburb to the east of the freeway is Balcatta , and 1 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 4 @,@ 300 ft ) further north is Reid Highway , with the southbound entry ramp looped . Balcatta Road joins the intersection of the southbound ramps with Reid Highway . Reid Highway , together with Tonkin Highway , provides a limited @-@ access route to Perth Airport . North of Reid Highway , Mitchell Freeway divides Carine to west from Hamersley to the east . There is no access to next major road , Beach Road . It forms the border between the City of Stirling and City of Joondalup LGAs ; as well as between Carine and Duncraig west of the freeway , and Hamersley and Warwick to the east . However , Warwick Road 's interchange is only 2 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 3 mi ) north of Reid Highway . It is a standard diamond interchange , but weaving is required between Reid Highway and Warwick Road due to the short distance between the interchanges . Greenwood is located north of Warwick Road and east of the freeway . 
 The following two interchanges , after 2 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) and 2 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 3 mi ) respectively , are with Hepburn Avenue and Whitfords Avenue . The Hepburn Avenue interchange is located at the corners of Duncraig , Greenwood , Kingsley , Western Australia , and Padbury ; while the Whitfords Avenue interchange is located at the corner of Kingsley , Padbury , <unk> , and Woodvale . Each interchange also provides access for the railway stations in the median ( Greenwood and Whitfords respectively ) via the southbound entry ramps , which are two @-@ way north of the carparks ' entrances . North of here , over a distance of 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) , are standard diamond interchanges with Ocean Reef Road , Hodges Drive , and Shenton Avenue , which provide access to Joondalup city centre , and Joondalup Health Campus , east of the freeway . West of the freeway are the suburbs of <unk> , Connolly and <unk> . After 700 metres ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) the freeway passes under Moore Drive , and then terminates at Burns Beach Road , 1 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 81 mi ) further north . Until the freeway is extended , access to areas further north is provided by Marmion Avenue to the west of the terminus , or via Wanneroo Road to the east . 
 = = History = = 
 The Mitchell Freeway began as a highway proposed in the Metropolitan Region Scheme in the mid @-@ 1950s . The original plan took the route , then known as Yanchep Highway , inland from what is now known as Karrinyup Road to the intersection of Wanneroo Road and Balcatta Road . However , the first gazetted edition of the Metropolitan Region Scheme , from 1963 , shows a controlled @-@ access highway along the current freeway alignment . The later plan only detailed the route up until a point east of Sorrento , at a proposed east @-@ west controlled @-@ access highway on the modern day Hepburn Avenue alignment . 
 Detailed design on the first stage of the freeway , from the Narrows Bridge to Sutherland Street at the northern edge of the city , began in 1960 , and took several years to be completed . The design included a complex interchange at the Narrows Bridge that was to be built on reclaimed land that was mostly soft mud . Ground improvement works , which included the installations of 43 @,@ 000 sand drains , began in 1964 ; demolition of buildings in the freeway 's path commenced in 1965 . The freeway was completed in three sections , under three separate contracts . Construction on the central section from Mount Street to Wellington Street started on 18 November 1966 , following a groundbreaking ceremony conducted by Premier David Brand . It was opened to traffic two years later , connected to the Narrows Bridge via a temporary Bailey Bridge over Mounts Bay Road . The new road carried up to 1400 vehicles per hour during peak hours . 
 Work on the section north of Wellington Street , known as the Hamilton Interchange , began in October 1969 . It was partially opened on 17 November 1971 , but was not completed until 4 October 1972 . The final part of the project to be completed was the Narrows Interchange . Construction began in 1970 with the installation of thirteen caissons , which would house foundation columns . Placement of the caissons was difficult ; as well as sinking vertically as intended , they also tilted and slid horizontally . Corrections were made by selective excavation , blasting bedrock , and applying tension via guy @-@ wires . Following the foundation works , construction proceeded swiftly ; most of the work was completed by 1972 . Premier John Tonkin opened the interchange on 30 November 1973 . This initial section functioned only as a distributor for Narrows Bridge traffic accessing Perth 's central business district or adjacent areas to the north @-@ west . Whilst initially referred to as the " Western Switch Road " , it was renamed after the former Western Australia State Premier and Governor Sir James Mitchell , on 5 June 1963 . 
 Several stages were built through the late 1970s , 1980s and early 1990s . The first extension of the freeway was nearly a mile long ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , taking the freeway to Vincent Street . This stage also included a long , curving bridge , eight @-@ span bridge connecting northbound traffic to Charles Street . The construction of this stage , which began in February 1974 , resulted in the suburb of Leederville being split in two . Residential and industrial buildings were demolished , and streets were cut off on both sides of the freeway 's path . The extension opened to traffic on 8 March 1976 , having cost $ 15 @.@ 15 million . It was opened by the state Minister for Transport , Mr R J O ’ Connor , MLA . A commemorative plaque was located under the bridge leading to Charles Street . 
 The design of Stage 3 of the freeway , a 4 @.@ 8 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 0 mi ) section extending to Hutton Street , was completed in 1974 . The existing soil was not suitable for construction , as the area generally consisted of soft peat and old landfills . In 1975 , the ground was consolidated with 720 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 25 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of sand . Construction took place between 1976 and 1978 , with the section opened by the Minister for Transport , David Wordsworth , on 2 June 1978 . A commemorative plaque was unveiled at the Powis Street bridge . This stage cost $ 12 @.@ 5 million , and received the Institution of Engineers Australia 's Western Australian Division Engineering Excellence Award in 1978 . 
 After a four @-@ year gap , construction of Stage 4 began , which would take the freeway to Erindale Road . The first half of the stage , up to Karrinyup Road , opened on 12 December 1983 , while the project wasn 't complete until 21 September 1984 . It was opened by the state Minister for Transport Julian Grill , MLA . This section completed 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) of freeway in Perth , from Bull Creek to Balcatta . The next two stages were constructed together , extending the freeway to Hepburn Avenue . Stage 5 was from Erindale to Warwick Road , and involved excavating a large quantity of material , including 600 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 590 @,@ 000 long tons ; 660 @,@ 000 short tons ) of limestone . That stage cost $ 22 @.@ 73 million , while Stage 6 only cost $ 8 @.@ 06 million . Both stages were opened together , on 6 August 1986 . The first stage of Reid Highway ( then known as the North Perimeter Highway ) was built at the same time , and opened on 16 May 1986 . A further extension to Ocean Reef Road was opened on 2 July 1988 by the Federal Minister for Transport , Peter Morris , at a cost of $ 17 @.@ 5 million . The state and federal governments provided most of the funds , $ 9 @.@ 7 million and $ 5 @.@ 2 million respectively . The City of Wanneroo contributed $ 1 @.@ 3 million , Joondalup Development Corporation $ 1 million , and land developers $ 300 @,@ 000 , as they wanted the freeway built ahead of schedule to stimulate local development . 
 In 1991 and 1992 , the median strip of the entire freeway was significantly widened to accommodate the Joondalup railway line , being built under the Northern Suburbs Transit System project . The line was to be located in the middle of the road reserve , between the freeway carriageways . At the time , the northbound and southbound carriageways , between Loftus Street and McDonald Street , were positioned next to each other , with space for future widening located on the eastern side of the road reserve . Initially , three new road bridges were constructed over Vincent Street , Powis Street , and Scarborough Beach Road . Once the road bridges had been completed and surfacing works completed , the southbound carriage was relocated , creating the required space for the railway line construction . Additional lanes were constructed in the realigned section , funded from regular road funding sources , whilst the bridges and some associated works were included as part of the costs for the Northern Suburbs Transit System project . 
 After a 7 @-@ year @-@ hiatus , a 3 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) extension to Hodges Drive was opened by the Premier Richard Court in December 1999 , two months ahead of schedule . The project also included widening the section between Karrinyup Road and Hepburn Avenue to three lanes in each direction . The latest extension was a 4 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) stretch to Burns Beach Road , with a diamond interchange at Shenton Avenue and an overpass for Moore Drive . Local residents were opposed to aspects of the initial plans , such as the design of a section near a primary school and the clearing of native vegetation . The state government therefore established the Community Consultative Working Group and later the Construction Reference Group , composed of members of the local community . The input from these groups resulted in several changes to the design . The project was managed by Main Roads in conjunction with <unk> Contractors . Construction of the extension was initially planned for May 2006 , but began on 14 December 2006 . By July 2008 , 90 % of the works had been completed and the new section was predicted to open in September 2008 . However , the official opening was not until 2 November 2008 , when the road was opened by Western Australia 's Minister for Transport , Simon O 'Brien , and the previous Minister for Planning and Infrastructure Alannah MacTiernan . The $ 160 million project was completed $ 10 million under budget . The opening was celebrated with a procession of vintage cars along the new freeway segment .

 In its 2011 / 12 budget , the State Government committed $ 30 million for the widening of Mitchell Freeway northbound between Hepburn Avenue and Hodges Drive from two to three lanes . Traffic volumes in the preceding years had increased rapidly , almost reaching the previously projected 2016 traffic volume of 40 @,@ 000 vehicles per day . The resulting congestion in the afternoon traffic peak increases the chances of rear @-@ end crashes as well as driver frustration . Construction of the third lane began in February 2013 , and is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year . A 4 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @.@ 8 mi ) section from Hepburn Avenue to Ocean Reef Road opened in August 2013 . As part of the project , the existing lanes will be resurfaced afterwards , during the summer months of 2013 – 14 . The design of the freeway is such that no <unk> will be required on overpasses , and rail services in the median will not be affected . 
 The freeway has also been expanded with an extra lane northbound between Perth and Hutton Street , in conjunction with works to increase the capacity of the Graham Farmer Freeway tunnel . Works progressed in two stages , with Vincent Street as the midpoint . As part of the project , the overpasses at Powis Street , Vincent Street and Scarborough Beach Road have been widened . An additional slip lane has been constructed , from Graham Farmer Freeway 's Loftus Street exit ramp to Mitchell Freeway northbound , to access Vincent Street without changing lanes to the left lanes of Mitchell Freeway northbound . The project commenced in February 2013 and was completed in December 2013 .

 The Mitchell Freeway is planned to continue north to the Metropolitan Region Scheme 's boundary , beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks . The state government announced in March 2012 the formation of the Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group . The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for relieving congestion , with a focus on the next freeway extension . Several options were considered , before the group released a strategic business case in November 2012 . The report recommends a staged approach , starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015 . This would be followed by a freeway extension to Hester Avenue , by 2017 and then an expressway standard extension to Romeo Road , <unk> by 2021 . Half @-@ diamond interchanges are suggested for Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue . 
 In December 2012 , the State Government announced the freeway would be extended to Hester Avenue between 2014 – 15 and 2016 – 17 , over a distance of 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) . The extension will include interchanges at Burns Beach Road and Neerabup Road . Work on the extension began with a ground @-@ breaking ceremony on 20 May 2015 , and is expected to be completed in 2017 . The projected cost is $ 261 @.@ 4 million , with the federal government contributing $ 209 @.@ 1 million and the state government funding the remaining $ 52 @.@ 3 million . The project scope includes a six @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) dual carriageway extension to Hester Avenue , Clarkson , with grade @-@ separated interchanges at Burns Beach Road , Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue . Other roads in the area will be upgraded , including widening Hester Avenue and Wanneroo Road , and extending Neerabup Road east to the intersection of Flynn Drive and Wanneroo Road .

 In October 2012 the state government announced that the freeway 's diamond interchange with Reid Highway will be upgraded with the installation of extra turning lanes and traffic lights . The project is an interim solution to lower congestion and reduce the volume of traffic using local roads to avoid the interchange . The longer term plan is to upgrade Reid Highway to a dual carriageway near the freeway interchange , including a second overpass bridge . The dual carriageway works are scheduled for construction in 2014 – 15 .

 " Not All Dogs Go to Heaven " is the 11th episode of the seventh season of the American animated television series Family Guy . It originally aired on Fox television network in the United States on March 29 , 2009 . The episode was directed by Greg Colton and written by Danny Smith . In the episode , Quahog hosts its annual Star Trek convention and the cast members of Star Trek : The Next Generation are guests . After he was unable to ask the actors any questions at a Q & A session , Stewie builds a transporter in his bedroom to beam the cast over and spend the day with them . Meanwhile , Meg becomes a born @-@ again Christian and tries to convert the atheist Brian to Christianity . 
 The episode garnered mixed reviews from critics and received a 4 @.@ 8 / 7 Nielsen rating . Star Trek : The Next Generation 's Patrick Stewart , Jonathan Frakes , Brent Spiner , LeVar Burton , Gates McFadden , Michael Dorn , Wil Wheaton , Denise Crosby , and Marina Sirtis all guest starred as themselves , and Adam West and Rob Lowe appear at the end of the episode in a live action scene . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Meg catches the mumps when the Griffins attend Quahog 's annual Star Trek convention , because Peter forced her to stand next to an irresponsible attendee with mumps to take a picture , believing him to be in costume as an alien . While recovering in bed , Meg becomes a born @-@ again Christian after watching Kirk Cameron on television and begins irritating everyone with her beliefs . Meg is horrified to learn that Brian is an atheist and attempts to convince him to repent and convert to Christianity , but he repeatedly refuses . Finally taking drastic measures , Meg spreads the word of Brian 's atheism around Quahog , which generally hates atheists , making him a social outcast . 
 Upon being made a pariah , Brian is banned from every bar and convenience store in Quahog , making it impossible for him to drink . Desperate , and suffering from delirium tremens ( he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them ) , Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking , but she takes him to burn books that are " harmful to God " ( including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin , A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking , and a book titled Logic for First <unk> ) . A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong . When Meg refuses to listen , Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God , then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter , and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist ( along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot ) . Feeling ashamed , Meg concedes to Brian 's argument and apologizes for her behavior , confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved . Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself , and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere . Afterward , it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe . 
 Meanwhile , furious that he did not get a chance to ask the cast of Star Trek : The Next Generation any questions at the convention , and the fact that the cast instead answered questions completely unrelated to Star Trek , Stewie builds an authentic Star Trek transporter and beams the cast over to interview them ( in a nod to the TNG episode " Skin of Evil " , Denise Crosby is killed in a show of force ) . Stewie decides to spend the whole day with the cast , which includes stealing Cleveland 's van , having lunch at McDonald 's , going bowling , and going to a carnival . However , they complain about minor things and greatly annoy Stewie , who beams everyone back after stating that they have ruined Star Trek : The Next Generation for him , and that he hopes they all die . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Not All Dogs Go to Heaven " was directed by series regular Greg Colton , in his second episode of the season ( his first one being " Road to Germany " ) . It was written by regular writer and recurring voice actor Danny Smith , in his first episode of the season . Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors . Seth MacFarlane , Family Guy 's creator and executive producer , is a fan of Star Trek and made two guest appearances as engineer Ensign Rivers on Star Trek : Enterprise , in " The Forgotten " ( season 3 , episode 20 ) and " Affliction " ( season 4 , episode 15 ) . Former Star Trek : The Next Generation cast members have also made other appearances in Family Guy : Patrick Stewart , for example , briefly voiced Peter Griffin ( normally played by MacFarlane ) in " No Meals on Wheels " ( season 5 , episode 14 ) , his American Dad ! character , Avery Bullock in " Lois Kills Stewie " ( season 6 , episode 5 ) , and his Star Trek : The Next Generation character Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard in " Peter 's Got Woods " ( season 4 , episode 11 ) ; Jonathan Frakes , Michael Dorn and Marina Sirtis also appeared in " Peter 's Got Woods " as their respective Star Trek : The Next Generation characters William Riker , Worf , and Counsellor Deanna Troi . 
 " Not All Dogs Go to Heaven " features the entire original cast of Star Trek : The Next Generation : Stewart as Captain Picard ; Frakes as Riker ; Gates McFadden as Doctor Beverly Crusher ; Brent Spiner as Lieutenant Commander Data ; Dorn as Worf ; Sirtis as Troi ; LeVar Burton as Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge ; Wil Wheaton as Wesley Crusher ; and Denise Crosby , whose character Tasha Yar died during Star Trek : The Next Generation 's first season . It is also the first time the cast , minus Crosby , has worked together since the 2002 feature film Star Trek Nemesis , although the actors did not meet when they recorded their speaking parts . 
 Wil Wheaton , who played Wesley Crusher on Star Trek : The Next Generation , recorded his parts for the episode on September 20 , 2007 . Seth MacFarlane directed the recording sessions with the guest stars .

Club , however , gave the episode a C grade , criticized " Not All Dogs Go to Heaven " as boring and formulaic and stated that the writers " have no idea how to best use Meg " . 
 = Prionomyrmecini = 
 Prionomyrmecini is an ant tribe belonging to the subfamily Myrmeciinae established by William Morton Wheeler in 1915 . Two members are a part of this tribe , the extant Nothomyrmecia and the extinct Prionomyrmex . The tribe was once considered a subfamily due to the similarities between Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex , but such reclassification was not widely accepted by the scientific community . These ants can be identified by their long slender bodies , powerful stingers and elongated mandibles . Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants were once found throughout Europe , possibly nesting in trees and preferring jungle habitats . Today , Prionomyrmecini is only found in Australia , preferring old @-@ growth mallee woodland surrounded by Eucalyptus trees . Nothomyrmecia workers feed on nectar and arthropods , using their compound eyes for prey and navigational purposes . Owing to their primitive nature , they do not recruit others to food sources or create pheromone trails . Nothomyrmecia colonies are small , consisting of 50 to 100 individuals . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Prionomyrmecini was originally described in 1915 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler in his journal article " The ants of the Baltic amber " , who originally placed it in the subfamily Ponerinae . In the same journal , Wheeler assigned Prionomyrmex as the sole member of the tribe . In 1954 , William Brown Jr. moved the tribe to Myrmeciinae , noting similar morphological characteristics of Prionomyrmex and other genera such as Myrmecia and Nothomyrmecia . In 2000 , Cesare Baroni Urbani described a new fossil species from Baltic amber , which he named Prionomyrmex janzeni . After examining specimens of his newly described species and Nothomyrmecia , Baroni Urbani noted that Prionomyrmex is a paraphyletic relative to Nothomyrmecia , and the two genera were so morphologically similar that Nothomyrmecia must be synonymised . Due to this , Baroni Urbani separated Prionomyrmex from Myrmeciinae and synonymised Nothomyrmecia , renaming Nothomyrmecia macrops as Prionomyrmex macrops . The tribe itself was later treated as a subfamily , known as <unk> . In 2003 , Dlussky & Perfilieva separated Nothomyrmecia from Prionomyrmex and both genera were moved to the subfamily Myrmeciinae , and Prionomyrmecini was treated as a tribe . In 2005 and 2008 , Baroni Urbani provided additional evidence in favour of his proposed classification , but such proposal has been rejected by the entomological community . Nothomyrmecia macrops and the extinct Prionomyrmex are the only accepted members of the tribe . 
 = = Description and distribution = = 
 Members of Prionomyrmecini can be distinguished from other members by the reduced or lacking ocelli , and a lateral clypeal carina is present . Prionomyrmex ants are characterised by their large size , slender bodies , elongated mandibles and powerful stingers . Lengths vary from 12 to 14 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 47 to 0 @.@ 55 in ) . Overall , the body structure of Prionomyrmex shows that it is more primitive than Myrmecia . Nothomyrmecia is smaller than Prionomyrmex species , measuring 9 @.@ 7 – 11 mm ( 0 @.@ 38 – 0 @.@ 43 in ) . The ant has a long stinger , the body is slender and , like Prionomyrmex , has elongated mandibles . The mandibles , however , are less specialised than Myrmecia and Prionomyrmex , elongated and triangular . While Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex are strikingly similar to each other , they can be distinguished from the shape of the node . 
 Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants existed in Europe during the Eocene and Late Oligocene . Cesare Baroni Urbani collected Prionomyrmex janzeni in Baltic amber from Kaliningrad , Russia and Prionomyrmex wappleri in Germany . Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr collected Prionomyrmex longiceps in Baltic amber from the Eocene , but the exact location of its discovery is unclear , due to the lost type material . P. longiceps were an arboreal nesting species , living in trees instead of the ground . William Morton Wheeler assumed this due to its long legs , sharp claws and elongated mandibles . Prionomyrmex may have preferred a jungle habitat at low elevations . 
 Nothomyrmecia is only found in Australia . Until its rediscovery , the genus was only known from the original specimens collected in Western Australia by Amy Crocker in December 1931 . Entomologist Robert W. Taylor expressed doubt about the type locality of the ant , but said that the specimens were probably collected from the western end of the Great Australian Bight , south from Balladonia . Entomologists feared that Nothomyrmecia was extinct , as notable biologists such as E.O. Wilson made attempts to find the ant but failed to do so . In 1977 , Taylor rediscovered Nothomyrmecia in Poochera , 1300 km ( 800 mi ) away from the original collection site . Colonies are found in old growth mallee woodland with many Eucalyptus species such as Eucalyptus <unk> , Eucalyptus oleosa and Eucalyptus gracilis abundant . Only a few small colonies are known in its restricted distribution , listing it as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex share similar behaviours with other Myrmeciinae relatives . Prionomyrmex may have foraged on the ground or onto trees and low vegetation , feeding on nectar and arthropods . Nothomyrmecia workers , however , drink hemolymph from the insects they capture , and the larvae are carnivorous . It is not known if the ants were active during the day or night , but Nothomyrmecia is a nocturnal ground forager that prefers very cold nights . Both ants have large compound eyes , relying on their vision for prey and navigational purposes . Due to their primitive and simplified social life , workers of both genera do not recruit others to food sources or leave down trail pheromones , suggesting that both these ants are solitary foragers . Prionomyrmex ants were hosts to female <unk> parasites . Predators are unknown for both ants . 
 Nothomyrmecia queens are brachypterous , meaning that they have stubby rudimentary wings that render them flightless . This may correlate with population structure , possibly as an adaptation in small populated colonies or by unusual ecological requirements . The alates may begin to emerge in late summer and early autumn ( March or April ) , and colony @-@ founding queens excavate to considerable depths underground ; queens start to lay eggs by spring . Queens are univoltine and only produce a single generation of ants annually , and eggs may take 12 months to fully develop . When a colony is mature , only 50 to 100 individuals are present in each nest . In some colonies , colony founding can occur within a colony itself when a queen dies , taken over by one of her daughters . This method of colony founding may render a nest immortal . 
 = 2016 Gent – Wevelgem = 
 The 2016 Gent – Wevelgem , ( officially Gent – Wevelgem – In Flanders Fields ) was a one @-@ day cycling classic that took place on 27 March 2016 . It was the 78th edition of the Gent – Wevelgem race and the seventh event of the 2016 UCI World Tour . The race followed a 243 @-@ kilometre ( 151 mi ) course that started in Deinze and ended in Wevelgem in Belgium , with a portion of the race spent in northern France . The race included ten climbs , several of them cobbled , which provided the principal difficulty in the race . The last and most difficult climb was the Kemmelberg . The favourites for the race included Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) , Fabian Cancellara ( Trek – Segafredo ) and Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff ) . 
 The race was won by Sagan , who escaped with Cancellara and Sep Vanmarcke ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) on the Kemmelberg after a series of splits and had occurred in the first half of the race . They were joined by Vyacheslav Kuznetsov ( Team Katusha ) , who had been in the day 's early breakaway , and the four @-@ man group came to the finish together . Sagan won the sprint , with Vanmarcke second and Kuznetsov third . 
 During the French portion of the race , the Belgian rider Antoine Demoitié ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) crashed and was then hit by a race motorbike . He died that evening . 
 = = Route = = 
 The route of the 2016 Gent – Wevelgem was significantly changed from 2015 edition and from previous editions . Several different climbs were used . Central among these was the decision to use a different side of the core climb in the race , the Kemmelberg . In previous years , the route chosen had a maximum gradient of 17 % , but the 2016 edition used a road that had a section at 23 % , described by Cycling Weekly as " excruciating " . The race director , Hans De Clercq , gave three reasons for the change : the cobblestones had recently been relaid ; the 2016 edition marked the 60th anniversary of the inclusion of the Kemmelberg , with the difficult side used on that occasion ; and there was a desire to give the race more of a balance between sprinters and attackers . <unk> , a Belgian work that lists and grades all the climbs in the country , rated the side of the Kemmelberg used in 2016 as the most difficult climb in Flanders : its grading of 183 points was more than the Koppenberg ( 172 ) , the Muur van Geraardsbergen ( 171 ) or the traditional route up the Kemmelberg ( 152 ) . 
 The race started in Deinze in East Flanders , 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) from Ghent . The route took the riders immediately into West Flanders . After 77 kilometres ( 48 mi ) of flat roads , they came near the coast at <unk> . Here the route took the riders south into northern France ; after 119 kilometres ( 74 mi ) the peloton passed through Wormhout , then continued south of <unk> , where there were the first climbs in the race . The first eight climbs came quickly , packed into a 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) stretch of road . The first climb was the Catsberg ; this was followed by the <unk> , the Vert Mon , the Côte du Ravel Put and the Côte de la <unk> . The riders then returned to Belgium and climbed the Baneberg , the Kemmelberg and the Monteberg . There was then a flatter section , looping through Mesen , <unk> and <unk> . The final two climbs were a repeat of the Baneberg – Kemmelberg combination . At the top of the final climb , there were 34 kilometres ( 21 mi ) of fairly flat roads to the finish in Wevelgem . 
 = = Participating teams = = 
 There were 25 teams selected to take part in the race . All 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited ; the race organisers gave wildcard invitations to seven UCI Professional Continental teams . These included two Belgian teams ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert and Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , two French teams ( Direct Énergie and Cofidis ) , a Dutch team ( Roompot – Oranje Peloton ) , an Italian team ( Bardiani – CSF ) and a Polish team ( CCC – Sprandi – Polkowice ) . Each team could include eight riders . Orica – BikeExchange 's team of seven was the only one submitted with fewer than eight riders , but three riders ( Team Sky 's Ian Stannard , Team Katusha 's Alexander Kristoff and AG2R La Mondiale 's Alexis Gougeard ) did not start the race ; 196 riders therefore departed from Deinze . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 There was some uncertainty before the race about whether it would favour the sprinters or those who attacked on the hills . Among the sprinters , Alexander Kristoff , the winner of the 2014 Tour of Flanders , was the favourite , with André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) , Arnaud Démare ( FDJ ) , Mark Cavendish ( Team Dimension Data ) , Elia Viviani ( Team Sky ) and Fernando Gaviria ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) also considered possible winners . Kristoff , however , had to pull out of the race due to a fever that started after E3 Harelbeke two days earlier . 
 There were also many riders who had the potential to attack earlier in the race . These included Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , who had won the race on three previous occasions , and his teammates Niki Terpstra and Zdeněk Štybar . Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff ) , the reigning world champion , had won the race in 2013 with a solo attack ; he also had the ability to perform strongly in a sprint . He had not yet won a race in 2016 . Other riders likely to attack early in the race included Fabian Cancellara ( Trek – Segafredo ) , Luke Rowe ( Sky ) , Sep Vanmarcke ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) and Edvald Boasson Hagen ( Dimension Data ) , who had won the 2009 edition of the race . 
 The 2015 winner , Luca Paolini , was not present to defend his title due to his suspension following a positive test for cocaine during the 2015 Tour de France . 
 = = Race summary = = 
 The race took place in windy weather . Combined with a crash , these conditions caused the peloton to break into several groups in the first part of the race . The first group was a five @-@ rider breakaway , composed of Lieuwe Westra ( Astana ) , Pavel Brutt ( Tinkoff ) , Josef Černý ( CCC – Sprandi – Polkowice ) , Jonas <unk> ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) and Simon <unk> ( IAM Cycling ) . Their lead extended to eleven minutes at one point , but was quickly reduced when the pace of the main peloton increased . This broke the peloton into echelons . By the halfway stage , there was a chasing group 90 seconds behind that contained many of the race favourites , including Boonen , Boasson Hagen , Cancellara , Sagan , Tiesj Benoot and Jens Debusschere ( both Lotto – Soudal ) , and Van Avermaet . They were chased by another group that was led by Trek – Segafredo and LottoNL – Jumbo ; this group was around a minute further behind . With 115 kilometres ( 71 mi ) remaining , the first chasing group caught the breakaway ; 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) later , this group was in turn caught by the other chasing group . There was therefore a 50 @-@ rider group at the head of the race . 
 There was calm in the peloton for a while , with five climbs remaining to be raced . Trek – Segafredo controlled the peloton over the Baneberg and the first climb of the Kemmelberg . Between the two climbs , however , Debusschere crashed and was forced to retire from the race . On the Monteberg , with 66 kilometres ( 41 mi ) remaining , five riders attacked . These were Matteo Trentin , who initiated the move , Brutt , Benoot , Daniel Oss ( BMC Racing Team ) and Giacomo Nizzolo ( Trek – Segafredo ) . They were chased by Dimension Data and LottoNL – Jumbo , but it took 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) to bring them back . When they were caught , Vyacheslav Kuznetsov ( Katusha ) attacked alone and had a minute 's lead by the second climb of the Baneberg . 
 Vanmarcke attacked on the Baneberg , but was chased down by the peloton , led by Manuel Quinziato ( BMC ) . On the second climb of the Kemmelberg , from the difficult side , Cancellara attacked and was followed by Vanmarcke and Sagan . They caught Kuznetsov and formed a four @-@ man leading group . They were chased at first by a group of Luke Rowe , Zdeněk Štybar and Greg Van Avermaet , but were able to increase their advantage . The chasing group was caught by the peloton and the four leaders came to the finish together with a comfortable advantage . They had a lead of 40 seconds until they slowed down significantly in preparation for the sprint . Kuznetsov was the first to sprint ; he was followed , however , by Sagan , who came past him to take the race victory . Vanmarcke finished just ahead of Kuznetsov to take second place , with Cancellara finishing fourth . The peloton finished eleven seconds behind , with Démare winning the sprint for fifth place . 
 = = = Death of Antoine Demoitié = = = 
 The race was marred by the death of Antoine Demoitié ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) . Demoitié crashed with four other riders near Sainte @-@ Marie @-@ <unk> during the French section of the race , with approximately 115 kilometres ( 71 mi ) of racing remaining . After the crash , he was lying on the road and was hit by a race motorbike that was following the riders . Demoitié was initially taken to hospital in Ypres before being transferred to the intensive care unit of the university hospital in Lille , due to the severity of his injuries . His team released a statement describing his condition as " extremely serious " ; several hours later , a spokesman for the local gendarmerie confirmed that he had died . The crash was seen by Julien <unk> , a directeur sportif for the AG2R La Mondiale team , who said that Demoitié had been part of a group chasing to get back to the peloton , travelling downhill at around 70 kilometres per hour ( 43 mph ) . He said that , when the riders crashed , there was no time for the motorbike rider to brake and he immediately recognised that the incident was very serious .

 There was widespread sadness among those involved in professional cycling following Demoitié 's death , especially after a second young Belgian cyclist , Roubaix – Lille Métropole 's Daan <unk> , died after suffering a heart attack at the Critérium International . Sep Vanmarcke tweeted " Suddenly a 2nd place no longer important after this terrible news . " Other riders , especially those in Demoitié 's Wanty – Groupe Gobert team , also expressed their sadness . The team 's directeur sportif , Hilaire Van der <unk> , paid tribute to his rider , saying that he was " happy because he was a cyclist " . Demoitié had made his first appearance at a World Tour race at E3 Harelbeke two days previously and had been in the day 's main breakaway . Following his strong performance , he had asked to be allowed to stay in the main peloton in search of a good finish in Wevelgem . The team withdrew from the Three Days of De Panne the following week . 
 As well as the tributes to Demoitié , many riders also called for improved safety for professional bike races . Many riders had been involved with crashes with race motorbikes in the previous few years , including Peter Sagan , Taylor Phinney , Greg Van Avermaet , Sérgio Paulinho , Jakob Fuglsang , Jesse Sergent , Sylvain Chavanel and Stig <unk> . Alberto Contador tweeted " Regulations on motos in races are needed NOW " , while other riders called for clear rules , speed limits and exams for race motorbike riders . Marcel Kittel described rider safety as an issue that needed the same priority as anti @-@ doping . Wanty – Groupe Gobert 's press officer said that the motorbike rider was experienced and was not to blame for the accident . The president of cycling 's governing body , the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) , said that there would be an emergency meeting of its Road Commission to discuss the incident ; he also said that they needed to wait for the result of the police enquiry and that it was important to make sure that the " right decisions " were made .

 Peter Sagan 's victory in the race was his first since winning the rainbow jersey at the world championships road race the previous year . It was the end of what Cycling Weekly called a " frustrating run " that had included second place at E3 Harelbeke two days previously . He said that he was very happy to have won in the rainbow jersey , especially as Gent – Wevelgem was an important race to him . He said that he was determined not to make the same mistake as he had in previous races by working hard in the final part of the race ; Kuznetsov 's early sprint then set him up for his own sprint . 
 Vanmarcke said that he was " pleased with second place " as he had had a difficult race . He was trapped in the second echelon when the race split early on and it took a " long pursuit " to get back to the leaders . Although he was not quite able to follow Cancellara and Sagan on the final climb , he rode aggressively on the descent and got back to them . He said that he was very tired at the end of the race and that it was hard to beat Sagan and Cancellara . Cancellara said " for sure it ’ s happy Easter day but it ’ s not happy Gent @-@ Wevelgem day " as he finished fourth out of four riders in the final sprint . He was happy , however , that he had always been at the front of the race and had not crashed . Cyclingnews.com wrote that he would still be the " principal favourite " the following Sunday for the Tour of Flanders .

 = Soeman Hs = 
 Soeman Hasibuan ( Perfected Spelling : Suman Hasibuan ; 1904 – 8 May 1999 ) , better known by his pen name Soeman Hs , was an Indonesian author recognized for pioneering detective fiction and short story writing in the country 's literature . Born in Bengkalis , Riau , Dutch East Indies , to a family of farmers , Soeman studied to become a teacher and , under the author Mohammad Kasim , a writer . He began working as a Malay @-@ language teacher after completing normal school in 1923 , first in Siak Sri Indrapura , Aceh , then in Pasir Pengaraian , <unk> Hulu , Riau . Around this time he began writing , publishing his first novel , Kasih Tak Terlarai , in 1929 . In twelve years he published five novels , one short story collection , and thirty @-@ five short stories and poems . 
 During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies ( 1942 – 1945 ) and subsequent revolution , Soeman — though he remained a teacher — became active in politics , serving first on a representatives ' council and then as part of the Indonesian National Committee for Pasir Pengaraian in Pekanbaru . Following the Netherlands ' recognition of Indonesia 's independence in 1949 , Soeman was made the head of the regional department of education , working to rebuild damaged infrastructure and to establish new schools , including the first senior high school in Riau and the Islamic University of Riau . He remained active in education until his death . 
 As an author , Soeman wrote stories which emphasized suspense and humour , drawing on Western detective and adventure fiction as well as classical Malay literature . His written Malay , with a vocabulary heavily influenced by his east Sumatran background , flowed readily and avoided excessive verbosity . Soeman 's most popular work was his novel Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan ( 1932 ) , whereas his short story collection Kawan Bergeloet ( 1941 ) has been considered his most interesting from a literary perspective . Though considered a minor author of the Poedjangga Baroe period , Soeman has been recognized with an eponymous library and his books have been taught at schools . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Soeman was born in Bengkalis , Riau , Dutch East Indies , in 1904 . His father , Wahid Hasibuan , and mother , <unk> Lubis , had been born in <unk> ( in what is now Mandailing Natal ) , but moved to Bengkalis after marriage to avoid conflict between the <unk> and a rival clan . In a 1989 interview , Soeman stated that he was not sure of the conflict 's source , but he suspected that his father , who was descended from a Mandailing king , felt as though his honour had been impugned . 
 In Bengkalis , Wahid and <unk> farmed pineapples and coconuts . Wahid also taught Quran reading , which provided supplementary income for the Muslim family . As his father taught at their home , Soeman began learning to read the Quran at a young age . Meanwhile , from the traders who visited Wahid , he also heard stories of the crimes committed in major cities such as Singapore . In 1913 Soeman <unk> at a local Malay school , where his teachers reinforced the importance of reading . Soeman took this lesson to heart , reading numerous books by European and Malay authors from the school library before he graduated in 1918 . 
 Hoping to become a teacher , Soeman tried out for a course for potential teachers in Medan , North Sumatra , soon after graduation . After he was accepted , he spent two years studying in that city . Among his teachers was Mohammad Kasim , whose later short story collection Teman Doedoek ( 1937 ) became the first such work in the Indonesian literary canon . Outside of class , Soeman would listen to Kasim 's stories about authors and the creative writing process ; this sparked his interest in becoming a writer . After two years in Medan , Soeman continued to a normal school in <unk> , Aceh , where he stayed until 1923 . There he met his future wife , Siti <unk> . 
 After graduation , Soeman found employment at HIS Siak Sri Indrapura , a Dutch @-@ language school for indigenous students in Siak Sri Indrapura , Aceh . Soeman worked as a Malay @-@ language teacher there for seven years , until 1930 , when he met a young teacher from Java who was involved in the nationalist movement . Soeman and several other teachers joined him for discussion and to furtively play the song " Indonesia Raya " , which was under a ban from the Dutch colonial government . When this was discovered , Soeman was transferred to Pasir Pengaraian , <unk> Hulu , Riau . Despite repeated requests for transfer , Soeman remained in Pasir Pengaraian until the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies began in 1942 , eventually being made principal . 
 = = Writing career = = 
 Soeman began writing in 1923 , shortly after finishing his studies . Inspired by his father , who stopped using the clan name Hasibuan in Malay @-@ dominated Bengkalis , he took the pen name Soeman Hs . He submitted his first novel , Kasih Tak Terlarai ( Undivided Love ) , to the state publisher Balai Pustaka . The book , about a young orphan who elopes with his beloved but must remarry her in disguise after she returns home , was published in 1929 . Soeman received a total of 37 gulden for the publication . 
 This was followed by Pertjobaan Setia ( A Test of Faithfulness ) in 1931 , a novel about a young man named Sjamsoeddin who is required to go on the hajj before he can marry Hajjah Salwiah , a rich merchant 's daughter . When Sjamsoeddin returns from his trip , he suffers an accident and is tricked by a man who lusts after Salwiah . Ultimately , however , Sjamsoeddin 's friend Djamin is able to reveal the treachery , allowing Sjamsoeddin and Salwiah to marry . The following year , two translations of Soeman 's novels were published by Balai Pustaka ; Kasih Tak Terlarai was translated into Javanese as <unk> tan Kena <unk> by <unk> , while Pertjobaan Setia was translated into Sundanese as <unk> by <unk> . 
 Soeman published another novel , Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan ( Seeking a Maiden 's <unk> ) , in 1932 . It follows Sir Joon , a man whose betrothal to Nona was called off after her father , Gadi , was offered a higher bride price . When Nona is apparently kidnapped , Joon offers his services to help find her . He builds distrust between Gadi and Nona 's would @-@ be husband , and ultimately that betrothal too is called off . Afterwards Joon leaves the village with Nona , whom he had taken from her home , and the couple lives happily in Singapore . For this novel , again published by Balai Pustaka , Soeman received 75 gulden . Over the subsequent decades , it became his most popular publication , and it has been identified as the first detective novel in the Indonesian literary canon . 
 Between 1932 and 1938 , Soeman published two further novels , Kasih <unk> ( Lost Love ; serialized in Pandji Poestaka in 1932 ) and <unk> Darah ( Blood Payment ; published in Doenia Pengalaman in 1939 ) . This latter novel marked the return of Sir Joon , who had featured in several other detective stories by other authors . Soeman also published thirty @-@ five short stories and poems , mostly in the magazine Pandji Poestaka but also in Pedoman <unk> and Poedjangga Baroe . Seven of Soeman 's Pandji Poestaka stories were compiled in Kawan Bergeloet ( Playmate ) , together with five original stories . With this collection , published in 1941 , Soeman became one of the first short story writers in the Indonesian literary canon . 
 = = Japanese occupation and Indonesian National Revolution = = 
 After the Japanese occupied the Dutch East Indies in 1942 , Soeman was made a school supervisor by occupying forces . He soon became involved in politics , being elected to the <unk> , a Japanese @-@ sponsored regional representatives ' council , for Riau . He later recalled that , because he had been elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces — and thus had strong backing among the community , which could be used for revolution — he had felt as though he was under constant surveillance . This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia . 
 Though the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence was made on 17 August 1945 , news did not reach Riau until September . In the following months , Soeman was elected to the newly formed Indonesian National Committee for Pasir Pengaraian , and later made its chairman . In this capacity , he had to strike a balance between former colonial staff who were looking forward to a Dutch return and those who supported an independent Indonesia ; Dutch forces were returning to Java , and physical conflict had already broken out between Allied forces and the Indonesian republicans in Surabaya . The following year , Soeman was elected to the Regional Representatives ' Council for Riau , based out of Pekanbaru . 
 Following Operation Kraai in 1948 , in which Dutch forces conquered the republican capital at Yogyakarta and captured much of the Sukarno government , Soeman was made commander of the guerrilla forces in Riau . Aside from continuing the fight , he was tasked with finding new fighters to support the republican cause . In this mission , he was aided in part by his extensive networks as a long @-@ term schoolteacher , and many of Soeman 's fighters were former students of his . Though his troops were <unk> , Soeman led them into combat against Dutch @-@ allied <unk> troops several times . 
 = = Educator and later life = = 
 Once the revolution concluded following the Dutch – Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949 , Soeman was recalled to Pekanbaru and made the head of the regional branch of the Department of Education and Culture . His main task was reestablishing and reinvigorating the education system in Riau following three years of the Japanese occupation and four years of revolution . <unk> had been used for firewood , school buildings had been razed to prevent enemy forces from using them , and much of the population had been unable to attend regular classes . Furthermore , the department did not have sufficient funding to support reconstruction . Over the next three years Soeman led communal work projects dedicated to restoring Riau 's education facilities , relying on voluntary contributions from the populace . 
 This was followed by a period of building further education infrastructure . To help elementary school teachers further their studies , Soeman took part in establishing a private junior high school in 1953 . The following year he helped establish the Setia Dharma Senior High School , the first senior high school in Riau . Minister of Education Mohammad Yamin attended the opening ceremony , where Soeman compared the situation in Riau to that of Aceh and North Sumatra and declared that the people of Riau had been treated like stepchildren . He called for Yamin to send government teachers to support Setia Dharma . Though Yamin objected to Soeman 's rhetoric and did not send any teachers to Setia Dharma , he did arrange for a state senior high school to be opened in Riau . 
 Soeman continued working to establish new schools in Riau . In the late 1950s , seeing the development of schools by Christian organizations , Soeman , working with other Muslims in Riau , began establishing Islamic schools at the kindergarten , elementary , junior high school , and senior high school level . In 1961 , Governor of Riau <unk> Nasution approached Soeman and asked him to join the Daily Governance Body of the provincial government . He did so and , working with the government , the Islamic Education Foundation established the Islamic University of Riau . Soeman conducted the formal inauguration ceremony in 1962 . 
 Though he had formally retired as a teacher to join the Daily Governance Body , from the 1960s Soeman was involved with several education foundations . He served as general director of the Institutions of Islamic Education Foundation as well as the chairman of the Setia Dharma managing board , the Riau Education Foundation , and the Riau Social and Cultural Society . He also maintained ties with the provincial government ; in 1966 , he formally became part of the Regional Representatives ' Council , and in 1976 , at the recommendation of Governor Arifin Achmad , he went on the hajj using state funds . 
 Soeman died in Pekanbaru on 8 May 1999 , having remained active in various aspects of education in Riau until the previous year . 
 = = Creative process and style = = 
 Soeman credited the adventure stories of Alexandre Dumas and similar authors , which he read in translation , for his interest in the adventure and detective genres . Soeman was interested in these stories ' use of suspense , which set them apart from the works of traditionally influenced Malay authors such as Marah Rusli . According to the cultural critic Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana , Soeman , in his construction of suspense , mimicked that of Western detective stories , rather than adapt the style for an Eastern setting . Traditional influences did surface in Soeman 's works , however . He credited his short stories ' comedic elements to the humourous aspects of Malay folk literature such as the " <unk> Malan " ( Unfortunate Quranic Teacher ) tales . 
 The poet Eka Budianta notes that a common theme in Soeman 's works was the strength of love and its ability to overcome obstacles . Soeman wrote of the power of romance and marriage for love in response to the treatment of women in adat ( traditional ) culture . Among the Malays of Riau , arranged marriages were common , and women would sometimes be married to men older than their father . Before marriage , young women would be secluded and unable to interact with any men except for the ones chosen to be their husbands . Similarly , Soeman used Kasih Tak Terlarai to criticize the mistreatment of orphans after adoption . 
 Some of Soeman 's characters are not identified as indigenous Indonesians , including Nona ( her name being common among the ethnic Chinese ) and Sir Joon ( a Eurasian ) . This was , in part , a bid to attract readers of different cultural backgrounds , as well as those living in Singapore . It also served to soften Soeman 's criticism . In an interview , Soeman recalled : " My stories always challenged the stiff adat . So to show this , my characters were always outsiders , who could be better accepted if they went against adat . That was my strategy , as an author , so my stories could be accepted . " 
 Soeman 's diction in his short stories was strongly influenced by his east Sumatran background , with extensive Malay vocabulary and less Javanese influence than many contemporary writers . However , as with his fellow writers of the Poedjangga Baroe generation , he avoided frequently using classical Malay terms such as <unk> ( ' it is told ' ) and <unk> ( ' thus ' ) . He was critical of the extensive verbosity of earlier literature , instead attempting to use a more succinct and direct style and avoid embellishments . In a 1936 article , Alisjahbana wrote that , in Soeman 's hands , " the stiff and frozen , heavily formalised , Malay language becomes fluid again " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Soeman 's works were often used for teaching literature to junior and senior high school students , particularly in Riau , where in the 1970s they were distributed by the provincial government . One of Soeman 's short stories , " Papan Reklame " ( " Billboards " ) , was included in a Cornell University Press @-@ published reader for foreign students of Indonesian , and HB Jassin included one of Soeman 's poems , " Iman " ( " Faith " ) , in the anthology Pudjangga Baroe ( 1963 ) . In 1993 , Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan was adapted into a television serial by August Melasz . 
 Towards the end of Soeman 's life , his books were only rarely republished and discussed , and a 2014 profile by the <unk> Center for Preserving Cultural Values describes Soeman as a forgotten educator and writer . However , Soeman 's works are still anthologized , and in 2008 the Soeman Hs Library in Pekanbaru was named for him . Designed to resemble a <unk> and thus reflect Islamic Malay culture , the six @-@ storey , glass @-@ walled library is operated by the government of Riau . In 2010 , the <unk> Foundation posthumously awarded Soeman the <unk> Kencana Prize for his dedication to preserving Malay culture . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 Soeman has been categorized as a minor author of the Poedjangga Baroe period . The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw writes that , though Soeman 's poetry maintained a conventional form , his detective stories were " unpretentious but pleasantly written " . However , he considers Soeman 's short story collection , Kawan Bergeloet , his most interesting contribution to literature , owing to its " well observed and realistically described " sketches . Alisjahbana , meanwhile , praised Soeman 's innovative use of Malay but considered the author 's plotlines to be at times inconsequential and illogical , with the narrative acting as " a child who quick as lightning shows his toys , then hides them again to pique his friends ' curiosity " . He considered Soeman 's work best read for its entertainment value . 
 In a film commemorating Soeman made by the Lontar Foundation , Budianta concluded : 
 You can say he only wrote a few works . You can say that his works are not that popular , not that monumental , but the presence of Soeman Hs as a writer of humorous and detective stories cannot be ignored . If we try to tell of the pioneers of humour and detective fiction , well Soeman Hs was their father . He can be considered the father of humorous and detective stories .

 Darren Middleton ( born 4 October 1971 ) is best known as lead guitarist and songwriter for alternative rock band Powderfinger . He was also lead singer / songwriter for Drag , he current solo tour is ' Splinters ' and this is a follow up to his 2013 solo tour ' Translations . ' The ' Splinters ' tour is Darren tour Western Australia and Victoria in August and November 2016 , respectively . 
 After Powderfinger ’ s dissolution in 2010 , Middleton released his first solo LP , “ Translations ” in November 2013 , featuring many guests such as Nic Cester ( Jet ) , Bernard Fanning ( Powderfinger ) , Pete Murray , Paul Dempsey ( Something for Kate ) , Clare Bowditch and Amy Findlay ( <unk> ) . 
 Middleton began guitar in high school , influenced by Twisted Sister and AC / DC , and began playing in clubs around his hometown of Brisbane as part of his first band , Sonic Tapestry . He went on to form another band , Pirate , with high school friends , and met Powderfinger at a Pirate show . He was invited to join the band , and did so . Middleton took part in all of Powderfinger 's recordings , at the same time writing and releasing an EP and studio album with Drag .

 Middleton was inspired to learn guitar by Twisted Sister and AC / DC , noting the first songs he wanted to learn could have been " I Wanna Rock " and " We 're Not Gonna Take It " , or any song by AC / DC . He did not take guitar lessons , and instead taught himself the instrument . Middleton formed a band named Sonic Tapestry with high school friends , and played around Brisbane 's " biker @-@ fest circuit " . The band 's first show was at the <unk> Hotel , on Wednesday 's " Heavy Metal Night " , however the band , unaware of the genre , played " 80s glam metal stuff " . 
 = = = Powderfinger ( 1989 – 2010 ) = = = 
 Middleton first encountered Powderfinger when it consisted of Bernard Fanning , Ian Haug , John Collins , and Jon Coghill . At the time , Middleton had been playing with Sonic Tapestry , and another band named Pirate . After seeing his band perform , Powderfinger invited Middleton to join them , and he accepted . Middleton described Powderfinger 's early days as highly influenced by other popular heavy metal bands at the time , especially Pantera . Despite the band 's members all having come from casual projects , the band 's meetings were highly serious , according to Middleton , although he admitted they were " confused " in exactly what they wanted to do . Powderfinger generally performed covers of The Rolling Stones , The Doors , Led Zeppelin , and Steppenwolf , as well as Neil Young in their early days , in similar clubs to those in which Middleton had first played . 
 Powderfinger released two early EPs and a debut album , without success , and considered separating , with Middleton contemplating a return to University . However , after Fanning wrote " Pick You Up " , the band 's mainstream breakthrough , they decided to stick together . From this point on , the band considered themselves to be making " real money " . 
 In 2001 , on a tour in the United States , Powderfinger played with Coldplay , in what Middleton described as a highlight . The band also played on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote Odyssey Number Five . After Coldplay cut short the tour , Powderfinger ended up playing numerous US shows themselves , before returning to Australia to play Splendour in the Grass . Middleton 's partner gave birth to the couple 's first daughter in September 2001 . Middleton summarised the year with the comment " This year has been a bit of a blur " . 
 = = = Drag ( 2000 – 2006 ) = = = 
 While touring with Powderfinger , Middleton also wrote his own works , occasionally fine tuning them in hotels where the band was staying . These would go on to be the songs he sang for Drag . Middleton formed Drag with drummer and Powderfinger engineer Mark McElligott , Brisbane bass guitarist Sean Hartman , and long @-@ time friend Matt Murphy . Drag released an EP , Gas Food Lodging , on 26 October 2003 through Dew Process . The band followed this up with several gigs in Brisbane ; a tour down the East Coast of Australia was canceled when Middleton caught the flu . After completing work on Gas Food Lodging , Powderfinger reunited and went on to record Vulture Street . 
 Drag reunited in 2005 to produce their debut studio album , The Way Out , which was released on 10 July 2005 . In recording the album , Drag spent three weeks at Byron Bay in March 2005 , collaborating with each other and producer David Nicholas . The album earned Drag some positive reception ; Rave magazine wrote that " Darren Middleton 's creative genius absolutely beguiled me with some extremely mature compositions " , and David Nicholas won an ARIA Award for his role as producer . The album was also nominated for " Engineer of the Year " . Following The Way Out , Drag toured around Australia , playing with UK band Athlete . This culminated with the bands playing at Splendour in the Grass , where it was noted that Middleton needed " to work on his stage presence " . Following the tour , Powderfinger reunited , and Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was released in 2007 .

 After Powderfinger called it quits in 2010 , Middleton started working on his first solo LP , “ Translations ” .

This tour is for the his newest solo project ' Splinters ' . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Middleton rarely takes a singer or songwriter 's role for Powderfinger , generally delegating those tasks to Bernard Fanning . However , the song " Over My Head " from Internationalist had Middleton performing vocals . This came about when Middleton did a recording of himself singing the song before Fanning had the chance to do so . Previously , Middleton had written the lyrics to " JC " , which was sung by Fanning . However , Middleton sung JC several times throughout the 2007 Upstairs at the Downstairs tour . Despite Middleton 's minimal songwriting , he has been praised for it by his band mates ; Jon Coghill told a 1999 interview that " Darren ( Middleton ) and Bernie ( Fanning ) are extremely good at writing songs . " Middleton agrees with this analysis ; telling Undercover 's Paul Cashmere in 2003 that " We are about writing good music . " He commented that the band used their position at the top of the Australian industry to comment and give people ideas to think about , rather than " trying to say people should take it as gospel " . Middleton has criticised the " boy band " phenomena , pointing out that " A lot of them can sing well , but they have people writing all their lyrics for them . " 
 Middleton has cited numerous Australian bands , including AC / DC , Crowded House , and Midnight Oil , as ongoing influences in his music , as well as international artists including Neil Young , Led Zeppelin , and Ben Harper . " I went through a bad eighties stage . Bad glam bands . Twisted Sister . Some really bad punk " , Middleton comments on the time in which he learned the guitar . Middleton has used a Les Paul guitar , and was praised by Alphonse Leong of Drop @-@ D , described as playing it " as well as any of the seminal axe @-@ <unk> of the hippie era " .

 = Cup of the Ptolemies = 
 The Cup of the Ptolemies ( French : Coupe des <unk> ) is an onyx cameo two @-@ handled cup , or <unk> . The cup , decorated with Dionysiac vignettes and emblems , was carved at some point in Classical Antiquity , probably in Alexandria . Eventually , it found its way into the treasury of the French kingdom , before it was donated to the abbey of St. Denis . During the Middle Ages , it was used as a Christian chalice , and lavish mounts were added , with Latin inscriptions . In 1804 , the cup was stolen , and the mounts were lost , although the cup itself was recovered . It is now in the Cabinet des <unk> at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France , Paris . 
 = = Description = = 
 The two @-@ handled cameo cup , one of the acknowledged masterpieces among hardstone carvings of classical antiquity , was carved out of onyx and measures 8 @.@ 4 cm high with a diameter of 12 @.@ 5 cm . The cup is covered in Dionysiac vignettes and emblems , depicting masks , vases , holy animals , and garland : symbols of the cult itself . 
 On the upper @-@ left side of what is today considered the back of the vessel , the mask of young Pan can be seen in the tree . Below , a goat is reaching for ripened grapes . Behind the goat lies fruit and a table , most likely an anclabris with five ceremonial vessels on top . On the left side of the table stands a small female figure , whose lit torches represent the festivities and the orgies associated with the cult 's rites . Frédéric de <unk> argued that the statues could very well symbolize either <unk> or Ceres , two deities often associated with Dionysus . Above the table is a tapestry and two bacchante masks . To the right , in an apple tree , another mask of Pan can be seen . Two more bacchante masks are present on the bottom , in front of the table . 
 The reverse side is extremely similar to the other , showing six masks surrounding a anclabris , although there are a few major differences . The anclabris is depicted as if it were made out of marble , and two sphinxes — beings that serve as allegories for the secrets and mysteries of the Dionysian cult — are supporting the table . On the anclabris stands a small statue of Hermes , next to which hangs a mask with pipes . Above this mask may very well be the raven of Apollo . On the left side of the table , a goat is seen resting on the ground , surrounded by the symbols of the cult . Finally , a wicker basket can be found to the right of the table , out of which a snake emerges ; this basket motif is often found in Dionysian artwork , and seemingly was an object of great importance to the religion . 
 It seems that the vessel 's pagan origins were overlooked when it was converted into a Christian chalice during the Middle Ages . Classicist Erika <unk> @-@ Diehl noted that many descriptions of the cup omitted the Dionysiac nature of the carvings and images , merely noting the general presence of trees , heads , and animals . This ( possibly purposeful ) loss of iconographic understanding , also referred to as " un @-@ naming " , seems to have been a way for pagan artifacts to be reused for Christian purposes ; the Cup of the Ptolemies is therefore an example of interpretatio <unk> , or the adaptation of non @-@ Christian elements of culture or historical facts to the worldview of Christianity . 
 = = History = = 
 The cup was probably made in Alexandria , Egypt . It was once thought to date back to the Hellenistic period , c . 250 BC , but is now regarded as dating to the 1st century AD . Its supposed connection with the Ptolemies dates back to a description in 1644 by historian Jean Tristan de Saint @-@ Amant ; he argued that the vase was made for the funeral processions of Ptolemy II Philadelphus , who ruled the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 285 until 246 BC . Scholar E. Babelon argued that the cup had been made in Egypt during the general time of the Ptolemies , a much looser range stretching from 305 to 30 BC . However , there is no particular evidence for this , and other scholars , such as John Henry Middleton or Martin Conway , suggest that the cup was carved later , during the first or second centuries AD by Romans . Dating the cup has been problematic largely because similar pieces are rare , making comparison difficult . 
 The exact history of the cup is largely unknown , although Conway suggests that the cup probably belonged to the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne before being passed down through the French kings , one of whom eventually donated it to the abbey of Saint Denis . The cup was occasionally used as a chalice for communion wine , and figured in the coronation of the French monarch , at which , according to S. G. Millet as quoted by Conway , the queens took " ablution from this chalice , after holy communion " . In 1634 , the cup was estimated to be worth around 25 @,@ 000 livres , with the gem @-@ encrusted gold mountings valued at 1 @,@ 200 livres . Until September 1791 it formed part of the treasury of the Basilica of Saint @-@ Denis . It was stolen in 1804 , although it was later recovered — without its mounts — when the thieves were caught in Holland . The cup is now in the Cabinet des <unk> at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris . 
 = = Chalice mount = = 
 Sometime during the Carolingian period , a base " in the shape of a truncated cone " was constructed to make the vessel appear more like a traditional chalice , and the cup 's knob was " partially covered with cloisonné goldsmith work " . Later , in the 12th century , Abbot Suger of Saint Denis ( who served from AD 1122 – 1151 ) probably embellished the chalice , adding the metalwork that widens the bottom of the chalice . These mounts were made out of gold and were gem @-@ studded . After the cup was recovered in the 19th century , it was missing its mounts , which were probably melted down for their precious materials . Today , the mounts are only known through an engraving by Michel <unk> that was made in 1706 . 
 Suger also added a two @-@ line Latin inscription on the chalice mount , known only from the engraving made by <unk> , which reads : hoc vas <unk> tibi [ <unk> ] mente <unk> <unk> in Francos [ <unk> ] <unk> <unk> . In English , this legend means : " The [ exalted ] Charles III , on the French throne , consecrated this vessel for you , Christ , with a [ faithful ] mind . " Most scholars agree that this inscription links it to Charles the Bald , who ruled Western Francia from AD 840 – 877 . Others think it refers to either the Charlemagne who ruled Francia from AD 768 – 814 , or Charles the Simple who also ruled Western Francia from AD 919 – 23 , although these suggestions seem unlikely .

 Animal Rights Without Liberation : Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane , in which it is argued that animal rights philosophy can be decoupled from animal liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest @-@ based rights approach . Cochrane argues that there is no reason that nonhuman animals should be excluded from justice , and adapts Joseph Raz 's account of interest rights to argue for a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed , but not a right to freedom , for animals . Subsequent chapters apply the theory to a number of interactions between humans and animals ; first animal experimentation , then animal agriculture , the genetic engineering of animals , the use of animals in entertainment and sport , the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use of animals in cultural practices . 
 The book is based upon Cochrane 's doctoral thesis , which was completed at the London School of Economics , and builds upon subjects he had discussed in previous publications . It was published by Columbia University Press as the second book in their series Critical Perspectives on Animals , edited by Gary Francione and Gary Steiner . Critics from a variety of backgrounds responded positively to the book , focussing on how Cochrane had found a middle ground between traditional animal rights philosophy and utilitarianism . 
 = = Background = = 
 Animal Rights Without Liberation is based upon Cochrane 's doctoral thesis , completed at the London School of Economics ( LSE ) under the supervision of Cécile Fabre , with Paul Kelly acting as an advisor . The thesis was examined by Anne Phillips and Albert Weale , the former of whom suggested the title which was used for the book . The arguments in the book differ from the arguments in the thesis , however , and in preparing the manuscript for publication , Cochrane drew upon the advice of a number of academics , especially Robert Garner . 
 In addition to presenting ideas used in the book at meetings of the Political Theory Group at LSE , Cochrane published an article entitled " Animal interests and animal experiments : An interest @-@ based approach " in the journal Res Publica in 2006 . This article won the journal 's second annual Postgraduate Essay Prize , and formed the basis of the third chapter of Animal Rights Without Liberation . Cochrane continued to work on questions of animal rights after the completion of his doctorate , publishing articles on the subject in Utilitas and Political Studies in 2009 , the latter of which provoked responses from Garner in 2011 and philosopher John Hadley in 2013 . Cochrane published his first book , An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory , through Palgrave Macmillan in 2010 . 
 Animal Rights Without Liberation was published by Columbia University Press , as part of the series Critical Perspectives on Animals : Theory , Culture , Science , and Law . The series , edited by legal scholar Gary Francione and philosopher Gary Steiner , aims to give direction to the emerging interdisciplinary research in animal studies . Animal Rights Without Liberation was the second book published as a part of the series , after Francione and Garner 's 2010 The Animal Rights Debate : Abolition or Regulation ? It was published in 2012 , both in paperback ( ISBN 978 @-@ 0 @-@ 231 @-@ <unk> @-@ 5 ) and with a cloth binding ( ISBN 978 @-@ 0 @-@ 231 @-@ <unk> @-@ 8 ) . 
 = = The interest @-@ based rights approach = = 
 Cochrane 's " interest @-@ based rights approach " is the method utilised in the book to examine various ways in which animals are used by humans . Rights set limits on what can be done , even in the pursuit of aggregative well @-@ being . The animal rights outlined by philosopher Tom Regan are based on the " inherent value " of individual animals ( see intrinsic value ) . For Cochrane and other critics , this basis can seem " mysterious " . Instead , Cochrane suggests that rights should be grounded in interests , and follows legal philosopher Joseph Raz 's formulation that 
 'X has a right ' if and only if X can have rights and , other things being equal , an aspect of X 's well @-@ being ( his interest ) is a sufficient reason for holding some other person ( s ) to be under a duty . 
 Cochrane draws out several aspects of this account , which serves as the basis of the analysis in Animal Rights Without Liberation . First , interests must be " sufficient to give grounds for holding another to be under a duty " . Judging this entails considering the strength of an interest as well as " all other considerations " ; so , for example , while individuals may have a very strong interest in free expression , but , " all things considered " , this need not protect slander . The greater interest of the victim of slander can outweigh the interest in free expression , and so context is important . This is the difference between prima facie rights and concrete rights . The former exist on an abstract level outside of particular circumstances . Prima facie rights can translate into concrete rights when considered in particular situations but do not always , as the free expression example illustrates . The account is for moral rights , and Cochrane 's normative claims are intended to form part of a " democratic <unk> " , informing and persuading political communities . 
 The strength of an interest is determined by a consideration of the value of something to an individual ( though this is not understood purely subjectively ) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied ( see personal identity ) . Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood , including many nonhuman animals and some humans , do not have an interest in liberty or not being used by others , and so have no prima facie right to freedom . They do , however , possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed , and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed .

 = = = Methodology = = = 
 Animal Rights Without Liberation seeks to decouple animal rights from animal liberation . For Cochrane , of central importance is the question of sentience , understood as " the capacity for phenomenal consciousness " . No position is taken on precisely how many animals are sentient , but , Cochrane argues , it is clear that at least some nonhuman animals are . <unk> alone does not afford moral status , but sentience implies the capacity for well @-@ being ; sentient beings have lives that can go better or worse for them . Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that personhood is required for moral value , but Cochrane observes that there may be nonhuman animals who could be considered persons . In any case , it is argued that there are good reasons not to agree with Kant , and Cochrane concludes that there is no reason to limit the possession of moral status to humans . What needs to be considered is not whether anything is owed to animals , but what is owed to them . Following a paper on animal rights by political philosopher Joel Feinberg , Cochrane suggests that animals possess rights on account of their interests . Cochrane then deals with four possible objections . Interest rights are defended against the claim that moral agency is a prerequisite of rights @-@ possession , against the demand that rights be derived from social relations , against the suggestion , from R. G. Frey , that animals do not possess interests , and against the idea that inanimate entities and plants may possess interests . 
 At this point , Cochrane has completed the first two steps introducing his interest @-@ based rights approach ; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities . Utilitarianism , as advocated by Peter Singer , is rejected because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough ; Cochrane desires an account which takes well @-@ being seriously but is not purely aggregative . This , he suggests , is one based on interest rights . After <unk> the details of his interest @-@ based rights approach , Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an <unk> large number of rights , and that rights approaches are too rationalistic . 
 = = = Application = = = 
 Having outlined his methodological approach , Cochrane goes on to apply his theory to a number of ways that animals are used by society . First , Cochrane considers animal experimentation , arguing that " animal experiments that result in pain or death are morally illegitimate , while painless experiments in which the animal does not die are permissible , all else being equal . " Cochrane discusses how to judge the strength of an interest , and then considers the strength of animals ' interests in not being subjected to painful experimentation . He considers three reasons the interest may not be sufficient to ground a right , and rejects them all ; that the benefits of animal testing outweigh the suffering , that humans owe more to members of their own species than to members of others ( see speciesism ) and that human lives are objectively more valuable than the lives of other animals . Cochrane concludes that animals have a concrete right to not be subjected to painful experiments . He next considers animals ' interests in not being killed , concluding that they " have an interest in continued life so that they may have more pleasant experiences and greater overall well @-@ being in their lives " , but that this interest is weaker than the corresponding interest possessed by human persons . If deadly experimentation on nonhuman non @-@ persons is permitted , then consistency demands that it also be permitted on human non @-@ persons , such as babies or individuals with certain cognitive disabilities . Like most others , Cochrane is unwilling to allow this possibility , and so claims that animals have a right not to be used in deadly experiments . However , he argues that animals have neither an interest in negative or positive freedom , and , like animals , human non @-@ persons also lack this interest ; therefore , neither have a prima facie right not to be used , provided said use respects the rights they do possess . 
 The second considered application is animal agriculture . Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights not to be made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food . The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used , and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method . Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged , and objections that this infringes on human liberty , that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh @-@ consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected . Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances , provided animals are not killed or made to suffer , and , equally , animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally . Three counter arguments are considered . First , Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist were it not for the human desire for their flesh is irrelevant . Second , Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators . He rejects Regan 's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good , instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive , but humans do not . Third , he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process . These animals , he suggests , are killed for human survival , but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat , they do not possess a concrete right to life . Despite this , political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest . 
 After looking at agriculture , Cochrane considers the relationship between animals and genetic engineering . The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered , he suggests , makes no sense , as live animals are not engineered , and embryos have no interests , so cannot have rights . Instead , Cochrane considers whether animals have a right not to have been engineered , arguing that it is not the case that they always do , and that if " genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well @-@ being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species , then it is ordinarily permissible . " Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim ; first , the notion that genetic engineering <unk> animals , second , the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant , third , that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character ( see virtue ethics ) and fourth , that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals . Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle . Cochrane considers whether animals may ever have a right not to have been engineered . He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living . He then rejects some reasons for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities , but concludes that they do , as engineered animals have an interest " in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well @-@ being " , an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right . However , Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism , as he is concerned not with equal capacities between members of a species , but equal opportunities for well @-@ being . Finally , Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering <unk> , non @-@ conscious livestock , arguing that , ordinarily , there is no wrong in engineering <unk> entities . 
 Chapter six addresses the use of animals in entertainment . Cochrane does not oppose the practice of pet @-@ keeping , and accepts that humans do have an interest in being able to keep pets , but that this interest is not so strong that it can be satisfied at any cost . He argues that pet @-@ keeping should be regulated far more than it is , perhaps through the need for a license , the granting of which would be dependent on individuals proving their ability to care for the animal 's well @-@ being . Cochrane is open to euthanizing pets , but only in cases when medical care could not give them a chance at further good experiences . In these cases , providing medical care would be necessary ( pet insurance could be a requirement for a license ) . Neutering pets is argued to be neither a violation of their rights nor a requirement , but anyone who does not have their pets neutered would be required to ensure the wellbeing of any offspring . The same requirements as were established in the chapter on genetic engineering are applied to animal breeding , and Cochrane accepts that this may lead to the extinction of certain breeds . Concerning zoos and circuses , Cochrane argues that animals do not possess a right not to be kept or displayed , but they do possess a right not to be made to suffer . This imposes limitations on the kinds of animals which can be kept ( for instance , large animals could not realistically be kept by traveling circuses ) , the conditions in which they are kept , and the nature of their performances . Hunting , cockfighting , dogfighting , bear baiting and bullfighting are condemned , as is , after some consideration , fishing . Cochrane is potentially open to greyhound and horse racing , or equestrianism generally , but says that " the way that these sports are currently organized and practiced does involve the routine suffering and death of animals and ought to be condemned as such . " Such practices include suffering caused during training and racing , and the killing of animals past their peak or who do not display the requisite skills . Before concluding the chapter , Cochrane considers , but rejects , three possible objections to any use of animals in entertainment : first , by appeal to a concept of dignity , which use of the animals undermines ; second , an appeal to disrespect , whether or not harm is caused ; and third , that the use of animals in entertainment implies ownership , and animals have a right not to be considered property . 
 In chapter seven , Cochrane approaches issues relating to animals and the environment . He first argues for the importance of this kind of analysis , before saying that , under the interest @-@ based rights approach , non @-@ conscious entities ( including species , ecosystems and plants ) cannot be understood to have rights ; he then defends the necessity of consciousness for the possession of interests . Cochrane considers , but rejects , the land ethic of Aldo Leopold as a basis for the moral status of the environment , but instead defends the environment on welfare grounds . Though he rejects the notion that wild animals might own the land on which they live , Cochrane concludes that we have strict environmental obligations due to the rights and interests of sentient animals . Concerning endangered species , Cochrane rejects the notion of " <unk> " ( that a special wrong is involved in wiping out a species ) and the idea of " compensatory justice " ( that more is owed to members of endangered species as a form of compensation ) . Instead , Cochrane argues that unconscious species may have contingent value , and members of rare conscious species may have a stronger right to life due to the interests of humans who will want to see them and the interests of other animals in their ecosystems Cochrane then argues that animals possess a concrete right not to be killed in order to preserve a favoured ecosystem , whether because of overpopulation of the species or because species are nonnative . However , control by contraception is argued to be acceptable . 
 In the final chapter on the application of the interest @-@ based rights approach , Cochrane analyses the use of animals in cultural practices , considering the importance of culture , religion and a concern about hypocrisy . Cochrane first looks at the possibility that humans have an interest in culture which outweighs certain interests of animals . He argues that it cannot be the case that culture can always outweigh other rights . He then argues the human interest culture cannot outweigh animal interests in not suffering , using <unk> as his example , or outweigh animal interests in not being killed , even if this entails the destruction of cultures " defined entirely by the grave harm [ they cause ] to animals " . The human interest in freedom of religion , Cochrane claims , will usually not require the violation of animal interests , but cites Santeria as a possible exception to this . Cochrane argues against the possibility that freedom of religion is a special interest and should always merit priority , and the idea that equal opportunity should entail religious freedom to harm animals . Finally , Cochrane considers hypocrisy ; given that animals are harmed in many practices , there may be a problem in disallowing certain religious practices . However , this does not make the religious practices more permissible , and seems to presuppose that these other practices will not themselves face censure . 
 = = = Conclusion = = = 
 The aim of Animal Rights Without Liberation was to " decouple animal rights and animal liberation " . Cochrane claims that not only is an alternative to the Regan / Singer dichotomy possible , but it is preferable . He argues that , though his theory would allow the use and ownership of animals in certain circumstances , the theory would nonetheless have " incredibly radical " consequences if applied . The book has aimed to persuade people of the importance of animal rights , and thus serve as " democratic <unk> " . This democratic <unk> , Cochrane claims , is essential for the legitimacy of animal rights . Relatedly , Cochrane firmly rejects violent interventions on behalf of animals as counterproductive , immoral and illegitimate . 
 = = Reception and response = = 
 Animal Rights Without Liberation was reviewed by Hadley on the Global Policy website , founder of Animal People Merritt Clifton , an unnamed reviewer for Internet Bookwatch , Rainer Ebert in the Journal of Animal Ethics , and Will Boisseau in the Political Studies Review . Hadley found the most important contribution of the theoretical framework laid down in Animal Rights Without Liberation to be the application of a <unk> framework of rights to animals , adding that " assuming that one takes philosophical reasoning seriously , there is little to take issue with in Cochrane 's analysis " . However , for Hadley , there is a fundamental tension in Cochrane 's theory , as there is in most animal rights literature . In denying that animals possess the psychological capacities to value freedom , Cochrane undermines the challenge to orthodox rights theory that it is not only persons who should possess rights . For Hadley , " only theories that have no truck with commonsense intuitions at all , like Bentham 's , are really in a position to place humans and animals on a genuinely equal moral plain . The rest , arguably , are more or less disguised versions of the person @-@ centred orthodoxy masked by rhetorical appeals to cross @-@ species equality . " Hadley denies that this tension undermines Cochrane 's overall argument , writing that it " ought to give no comfort to opponents of animal rights . [ Cochrane 's ] reasoning , assuming you accept animals matter at all , is as uncontroversial as his writing is accessible . " 
 Hadley closed his review by considering the book 's middle ground between traditional rights theory and utilitarianism , writing that , for Cochrane 
 in line with orthodox animal rights theory , animals are owed some utility @-@ trumping rights — a right not to suffer and a right not to be killed ; but , in line with utilitarianism , [ Cochrane ] wants to promote well @-@ being without giving animals a right to liberty in the sense of outright protection from ownership and use by humans . Cochrane thus successfully ‘ <unk> ’ the rights @-@ utilitarian dichotomy and locates his theory in the middle ground between the two . You might say he gives with one hand while taking away with the other . 
 Clifton and Ebert , too , focussed on Cochrane 's attempt to find and conceptualise a middle ground between the work of Regan ( who advocates animal rights ) and Singer ( who advocates animal welfare from a utilitarian perspective ) . However , Clifton suggested that Cochrane 's thought is actually closer to Regan 's . Boisseau , though , suggested that , given that Cochrane allows some use of animals in entertainment and genetic engineering , the arguments of Animal Rights Without Liberation may come across as " radically permissive " when compared with those of other animal rights positions . The permissibility of some forms of animal experimentation under Cochrane 's account " may shock " supporters of approaches based upon Regan 's philosophy . Ebert concluded that " the great accomplishment of Cochrane 's book is to show that there is a coherent , intuitively plausible , and useful notion of animal rights that is firmly rooted in the tangible and avoids the unattractive absolutism of Regan @-@ style rights views " . 
 Ebert felt that the " rather disconcerting " element of Cochrane 's thought concerning <unk> humans was dealt with too quickly in the book , saying that " controversy would be certain if infants or the seriously mentally disabled were regarded as property or put up for display in human zoos , regardless of how well they were taken care of . If we believe that human <unk> have a right not to be treated in such a degrading manner , then so do nonhuman animal <unk> . " Boisseau , too , found the aspect of Cochrane 's thought dealing with " people with mental disabilities " to be " objectionable " . 
 Clifton approvingly quoted the arguments in Animal Rights Without Liberation concerning animals killed in crop harvest , and observed that , other than a hypothetical openness towards ethically produced eggs and dairy , Cochrane 's arguments would seem to favour veganism over vegetarianism . Clifton also showed interest in Cochrane 's arguments concerned pet @-@ keeping , writing " Cochrane never mentions pit bulls , but his argument is in effect a case for prohibiting pit bull breeding : pit bulls have never been more than 5 % of the U.S. dog population , but are 20 % of the dogs impounded in cruelty and neglect cases . " Boisseau worried that animal activists may find the imprecise positions of " animal rights " or " animal liberation " more useful than Cochrane 's comparatively nuanced position , and questioned the extent to which political and legal change could be possible given continued use of animals . 
 The book was summarised in Internet Bookwatch as " [ p ] <unk> , insightful , rational , iconoclastic , informed and informative " . It was described as " thoughtful and thought @-@ provoking , making it a welcome and highly recommended addition to personal and academic library Contemporary Ethics reference collections and supplemental reading lists . " In addition to a quote from Internet Bookwatch , Columbia University Press advertised Animal Rights Without Liberation with quotes from several academics working in the area of animal ethics . Philosophers Peter Singer and Paula Casal praised work for exposing a false dichotomy of animal rights versus animal welfare , both seeing the work as an important contribution to the literature for this reason . Francione , an advocate for an animal rights approach which does mandate liberation , was quoted as saying that " It would be an understatement to say that I disagree with Cochrane but he does a fine job presenting the argument and his book will surely provoke debate and discussion . " 
 Columbia University Press also quoted Garner , who praised the work for being the first sustained attempt to use an interest @-@ based theory of rights for animals , and the first to use such a theory to challenge animals ' right to liberty . In his 2013 A Theory of Justice for Animals , Garner challenges Cochrane on his use of the argument from marginal cases . If animals are assumed to have an equal interest in life as typical humans because marginal humans are , then one could also assume animals to have an equal interest in liberty , because of the assumption of marginal humans ' interest in liberty . Cochrane , however , denies that marginal humans are assumed to have a strong interest in liberty . The first part of the argument , Garner observes , assumes that marginal humans are considered to have an equal interest in ( or an equal right to ) life ; this is a claim which Garner challenges , reaching what he considers a more nuanced position than Cochrane 's . Nonetheless , the ideal theory which Garner endorses — the enhanced sentience position — is close to Cochrane 's interest @-@ based rights position . Garner himself identifies differences between his thought and Cochrane 's in their respective use of the argument from marginal cases and the fact that Garner offers a nonideal theory , while Cochrane does not . Garner also questions the extent to which Cochrane is right that his reliance on interest rights is new , suggesting that Feinberg , James <unk> and Steve Sapontzis all used the language of interest rights . Garner adds that " what Cochrane does , unlike Sapontzis , is to draw what I think are the correct conclusions from the adoption of an interest @-@ based theory of animal rights " .

 Johnston Livingston de Peyster ( June 14 , 1846 – May 27 , 1903 ) was a soldier in the Union Army during the American Civil War and later a member of the New York State Assembly from Dutchess County , New York . The son of a wealthy old Dutchess County family , de Peyster joined the Union Army at the age of eighteen . He saw service in the eastern theater , and is best remembered for raising the first Union flag over the Confederate capitol of Richmond , Virginia , after its fall in 1865 . 
 After the war , de Peyster served overseas as a dignitary . When he returned to the United States , he ran for office and was elected to the State Assembly . His father disagreed with many of his political positions , and they eventually stopped speaking to each other . In 1900 , the family feud culminated in a race for the office of Mayor of their native town , father running against son . After defeating his father , who owned the town hall , he was forced to move the Mayor 's office to a new building . He died in 1903 , survived by his three daughters . 
 = = Early career = = 
 De Peyster was born in Tivoli , New York at his family 's estate . He was a member of the wealthy de Peyster family of New York , son of Major General John Watts de Peyster and brother of Brigadier General John Watts de Peyster Jr . He was also a second cousin of Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny , and his great @-@ great @-@ great @-@ grandfather was Abraham de Peyster , an early Mayor of New York City , whose father was Johannes de Peyster , a wealthy merchant . 
 At the start of the war in 1861 , Johnston was fifteen years old and attending Highland Military College in Newburg , New York . He remained in school through 1862 , but then left to raise a company for a regiment being organized in New York . De Peyster 's father paid ten @-@ dollar bounties to the men who signed the muster roll of his company . He was not able to assume command because of his age , and his family also felt he was too young for service . However , in the winter of 1863 , he threatened to travel to Washington , D.C. and stand for examination for an <unk> with a colored regiment . 
 In 1864 , at the age of eighteen , his family allowed him to join the Union Army as a second lieutenant . He was assigned to Company H of the 13th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment , assigned to the third division of XVIII Corps , Army of the James , commanded by Brig. Gen. Edward Winslow Hinks . The division was part of Major General Benjamin Butler 's disastrous Bermuda Hundred Campaign and was engaged at Swift Creek on May 9 . It was left behind at Bermuda Hundred while the first and second divisions traveled to join Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant at Cold Harbor with two divisions from the X Corps . He was stationed at Fort O 'Rourke located in Norfolk , Virginia where he contracted a fever and was sent home for six months , missing the unit 's heaviest engagements at the Siege of Petersburg and the second battle of Fair Oaks . The illness he contracted would plague him for the next eighteen years . 
 = = Richmond = = 
 Upon his return , he joined the staff of Brigadier General George F. Shepley , commanding the military district of Norfolk . When General Shepley was assigned as Chief of Staff to the XXV Corps commanded by Major General Godfrey Weitzel , de Peyster became an aide to Weitzel , and eventually his Chief of Staff . The unit de Peyster had originally joined , the 13th New York , was also assigned in the XXV Corps . He is credited with raising the first Union flag over the Confederate capitol of Richmond , Virginia after its fall . The flag was the same one that had been raised over the city of New Orleans , Louisiana after its fall . Shepley had been the military Governor of New Orleans , and later the State of Louisiana while it flew there . 
 Initially , de Peyster had been selected to lead an assault on the breastworks outside the city , however the night before the assault he noticed the city aflame from a signal tower and informed General Weitzel . The men of the corps then entered the city unmolested . Admiral David Farragut later claimed that de Peyster was due as much credit as he would have received had he actually taken the city by storming it , because doing it without bloodshed still carried the same intent . 
 There was some dispute over who raised the first " flag " over the capitol in Richmond after it was learned that a Maj. A.H. Stevens had raised a guidon two hours before de Peyster hoisted the national flag , Ulysses S. Grant eventually declared that de Peyster should receive the credit because a guidon was not really a flag . Despite this , de Peyster 's father , a military critic , was highly derogatory when writing about Grant and his achievements . The young lieutenant reflected on the incident in a letter to his mother : 
 Headquarters , Army of the James 
 Richmond , April 3 , 1865 . 
 My dearest mother , — This morning , about four o 'clock , I was got up , just one hour after I retired , with the information that at six we were going to Richmond . At six we started . The <unk> had gone at three , along a road strewn with all the munitions of war . Richmond was reached , but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames . The roar of the bursting shells was terrific . 
 Arriving at the capitol , I sprang from my horse , first <unk> the stars and stripes , a large flag I had on the front of my saddle . With Captain Langdon , chief of artillery , I rushed up to the roof . Together we hoisted the first large flag over Richmond , and on the peak of the roof drank to its success . 
 In the capitol I found four flags — three rebel , one ours . I presented them all , as the conqueror , to General Weitzel . I have fulfilled my bet , and put the first large flag over <unk> . I found two small <unk> , took them down , and returned them to the Fourth Massachusetts Cavalry , where they belonged . I write from Jeff . Davis 's private room . . . 
 I remain ever your affection son , 
 " <unk> " 
 For this act , he received a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel of volunteers , " for gallant and meritorious conduct , and for hoisting the first real American flag over Richmond , Va . , after its capture by the Union forces , April 3 , 1865 , and as a testimonial of the zeal , fidelity , and courage with which he had maintained the honor of the State of New York in her efforts to enforce the laws of the United States , supremacy of the constitution , and a republican form of government " . Shortly thereafter , he received another brevet promotion to colonel , although this order did not mention the flag raising incident . He opted not to go with General Weitzel and the XXV Corps to Texas , but instead resigned in June 1865 . He thereafter was associated with Samuel W. Crawford in an unofficial capacity . 
 = = Later life = = 
 After the war he returned to Tivoli , New York and was active in the American Archaeological Association and the New York Yacht Club . He also joined the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the General Society of Colonial Wars . 
 He was an attaché to Daniel Sickles when the former general was appointed Minister to Spain by President Grant . He was married to Annie Toler and had three daughters . 
 He was elected to the New York State Assembly from Duchess county in 1889 and reelected for a second term . He then served as Mayor of his native village of Tivoli @-@ on @-@ Hudson for several terms , and President of the New York Society Library . He was active in philanthropy , and made numerous donations to libraries and historical societies . 
 Although he shared interests in both philanthropy and military affairs with his father , they eventually had a falling out while Johnston served as a State Assemblyman , and was bitterly opposed by his father in a vote on the 1889 World 's Fair Bill . The feud became so heated that while Johnston was Mayor of Tivoli , his father , who owned the building where the town government met , barred his son from entering the building . The village government was forced to move to another building and remained there until 1894 , when they finally returned to de Peyster 's building . Another incident occurred and was reported in the press when Johnston 's mother fell ill , and he visited her at the de Peyster family home and was violently assaulted by his father .

 The 1998 Music City Bowl was a postseason college football game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and Alabama Crimson Tide . It was the inaugural competition of the annual Music City Bowl . Virginia Tech represented the Big East and the University of Alabama represented the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) . The game was the final competition for each team in the 1998 college football season . The game ended as a 38 – 7 victory for Virginia Tech . 
 Virginia Tech 's 8 – 3 record during the 1998 college football regular season was good enough to earn it a bid to the inaugural Music City Bowl game . Facing the Hokies were the Alabama Crimson Tide , who had gone 7 – 4 during the regular season . 
 The 1998 Music City Bowl kicked off on December 29 , 1998 in Nashville , Tennessee . The weather at kickoff was " horrid , " as rain and sleet mixed in freezing temperatures . The game 's early going was marked by defense as both teams struggled against the inclement weather . Virginia Tech scored first off a 43 @-@ yard touchdown scramble by quarterback Al Clark . Clark 's touchdown provided the game 's only points until the second quarter , when Alabama evened the score at 7 – 7 with a five @-@ yard touchdown pass . The Hokies struck back with a field goal before halftime and took a tenuous 10 – 7 lead into the second half . 
 In that half , the Tech offense finally got rolling . The Hokies scored 14 points in both the third and fourth quarters , ending the game on an uncontested 28 – 0 run . Alabama 's offense was stifled throughout by effective pressure from Tech defensive end Corey Moore , and Tech was able to turn several fumbles and interceptions by the Crimson Tide into points on the scoreboard . The final 38 – 7 Virginia Tech victory was the biggest win in Virginia Tech bowl game history , and Moore was named the game 's most valuable player . The two teams did not meet again until the 2009 Chick @-@ fil @-@ A Kickoff Game on September 5 , 2009 .

 The first Music City Bowl was scheduled for 1998 , but the bowl 's beginnings dated from 1996 , when city officials and local companies came up with the idea for the game . Their plan developed through 1997 , when financing was obtained and the NCAA approved the bowl game . Initial plans anticipated matching a Southeastern Conference team against one from the Mid @-@ American Conference . Prior to the start of the 1998 college football season , Music City Bowl officials signed an agreement with the SEC to select the conference 's sixth bowl @-@ eligible team . The Music City Bowl 's other spot was left for an at @-@ large bid , though officials met several times with Big East commissioner Mike <unk> in an effort to reach a contract . An agreement pledging the Big East 's No. 4 bowl @-@ eligible team to the game was not reached until 1999 .

 The Alabama Crimson Tide entered the 1998 college football season after a 1997 season that included a 4 – 7 and no bowl game . Heading into the season , the Tide were unranked nationally and were picked to finish fifth in the SEC West in the annual poll of media members who cover SEC football . Most voters expected Alabama to show little improvement over its performance in the previous year . 
 Alabama 's first game of the season was against Brigham Young University and was played at a renovated Bryant @-@ Denny Stadium that boasted more than 80 @,@ 000 seats and a new Jumbotron . In that game , Alabama running back Shaun Alexander scored a school @-@ record five rushing touchdowns and Alabama won , 38 – 34 , breaking a four @-@ game losing streak that ended the 1997 season . One week later , Alabama repeated its first @-@ game success with a 42 – 7 win over Vanderbilt . After a bye week , Alabama traveled to Arkansas to play the Arkansas Razorbacks . Alabama had risen to No. 22 in the country by virtue of its two wins , but the Crimson Tide 's first road game of the season resulted in its first defeat , as Alabama lost , 42 – 6 . One week later , Alabama suffered its first home loss of the season , a 16 – 10 defeat at the hands of Florida . 
 After the Florida loss , Alabama 's senior starting quarterback , John David Phillips , was replaced by freshman Andrew Zow . With Zow as the new starter , Alabama proceeded to win its next two games : 20 – 17 against Ole Miss and 23 – 22 against East Carolina . On October 24 , Zow endured his first loss as the team 's starting quarterback when Alabama was defeated , 35 – 18 , by eventual SEC ( and national ) champion Tennessee . Alabama rebounded from the loss by reeling off two more wins : 30 – 20 against Southern Miss and an upset 22 – 16 win over LSU , in which the Crimson Tide scored 15 points in 144 seconds . 
 After those two wins , Alabama had a 6 – 3 record heading into the final two weeks of the regular season . In the second @-@ to @-@ last week , the Crimson Tide were defeated , 26 – 14 , by Mississippi State . In the final week of the season , Alabama faced traditional in @-@ state rival Auburn in the annual Iron Bowl game . Reversing the outcome of the previous year 's game , Alabama eked out an upset 31 – 17 victory to end the regular season . 
 Following the Iron Bowl , Alabama 's bowl destination was unclear due to the SEC championship game , which determined the conference champion on December 5 . Until then , speculation centered on Alabama potentially attending any of four games : the Peach Bowl , Independence Bowl , Sun Bowl , or Music City Bowl . By the time of the championship game , the Sun Bowl had been eliminated as an option . After Tennessee won the SEC championship game and a bid to the Fiesta Bowl , other teams were selected by the Peach Bowl and Independence Bowl , leaving Alabama to be selected for the inaugural Music City Bowl . The choice was made official on December 6 , and Alabama began preparing for its matchup with Virginia Tech .

 Virginia Tech began the 1998 season after going 7 – 5 the previous year , including a 42 – 3 blowout loss to North Carolina in the 1998 Gator Bowl . Prior to the 1998 season , the annual preseason poll of Big East football media picked Virginia Tech to finish fourth in the Big East , and West Virginia was favored to win the conference . Most pre @-@ season attention was focused on whether Tech would perform well enough to attend a sixth consecutive bowl game at the season 's end . 
 The Hokies ' first two games brought success for Virginia Tech : At home , they defeated East Carolina , 38 – 3 , and away , they beat Clemson , 37 – 0 . After the blowout win in Death Valley , Virginia Tech traveled to the Orange Bowl , home of the Miami Hurricanes . By virtue of their two season @-@ opening wins , the Hokies were ranked No. 21 in the coaches ' poll , and they improved that ranking with a win in the first overtime football game in Virginia Tech history , 27 – 20 . 
 During the overtime win , Virginia Tech starting quarterback Al Clark was injured . The injury left him unable to play in Tech 's next game , a contest against the Pittsburgh Panthers . Clark 's absence didn 't distract the Hokies , who won , 27 – 7 . After the win against Pittsburgh , Virginia Tech traveled to Boston to play Boston College . The Hokies shut out the Boston College Eagles , 17 – 0 , boosting their national ranking to No. 10 in the coaches ' poll on the basis of Tech 's first 5 – 0 start since 1967 . 
 Following the Boston College victory , the Hokies faced lightly regarded and winless Temple University . The Temple Owls had lost eight consecutive games , were 0 – 26 in Big East road games , and had lost 10 players to injury since the season began . But although the Owls were 35 @-@ point underdogs to the Hokies , they managed one of the biggest upsets in college football history when they beat Virginia Tech in Lane Stadium , 28 – 24 . 
 Virginia Tech rebounded from the upset loss to Temple by shutting out the University of Alabama Birmingham , 41 – 0 , then beating No. 21 West Virginia , 27 – 13 . After the two wins , the Hokies had a 7 – 1 record , were ranked No. 16 in the AP Poll , and traveled to the Carrier Dome to play Syracuse University . In New York , Syracuse gave the Hokies their second loss of the season , 28 – 26 . The loss came despite the presence of Al Clark , who had returned from injury prior to the West Virginia game . Tech again rebounded from a losing effort , this time by defeating Rutgers , 47 – 7 . But in their final regular @-@ season game , the Hokies lost to Virginia in the annual competition for the Commonwealth Cup , 36 – 32 . Tech led by 22 points at halftime , but Virginia quarterback Aaron Brooks led a comeback that won the game for Virginia with two minutes remaining in the game . 
 The loss to Virginia brought Virginia Tech to an 8 – 3 regular @-@ season record , something Tech coach Frank Beamer said was better than he expected at the season 's start . Despite that sentiment , most fans and supporters pointed to the fact that in all of Virginia Tech 's losses , the deciding points came late in the fourth quarter and near the end of the game . Only three plays separated Tech from an undefeated 11 – 0 record . Tech 's bowl destination was unclear immediately after the Virginia loss . The Music City Bowl seemed likely , but the Micron PC Bowl , Insight.com Bowl , and Sun Bowl also were possibilities . Virginia Tech officials preferred the Music City Bowl because of its proximity to Virginia , and bowl officials selected the Hokies on November 30 .

 The inaugural Music City bowl marked the first meeting of Alabama and Virginia Tech on the football field since 1979 , when the No. 1 Crimson Tide defeated Virginia Tech , 31 – 7 . Prior to the Music City Bowl , Alabama had defeated Virginia Tech in all 10 meetings of the two schools , and some Virginia Tech players cited that record as motivation in the game . For American General , sponsoring the game was part of an overall marketing strategy intended to boost the company 's national profile . Spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win the game by five points . In exchange for appearing in the game , each team received $ 750 @,@ 000 , minus expenses . Media coverage in the weeks leading up to the game focused on Virginia Tech 's tough defense and Alabama 's recovery from NCAA @-@ imposed sanctions . 
 = = = Ticket sales = = = 
 Both schools sold their allotments of Music City Bowl tickets rapidly . Virginia Tech , which was attending its sixth consecutive bowl game , sold more than 9 @,@ 000 tickets in the first week of sales . Alabama 's tickets were primarily distributed to season @-@ ticket holders . Of Alabama 's 12 @,@ 000 bowl tickets , 10 @,@ 000 were reserved for season @-@ ticket holders and only 2 @,@ 000 were available for open purchase . These were sold on the first day of sales . By December 9 , both Alabama and the game itself had sold their entire allotment of tickets . Virginia Tech had just 200 tickets remaining , and they were sold by the 10th . In an interview with a local newspaper , an official at the Virginia Tech ticket office indicated that demand for tickets was so great that " We could have sold at least a couple thousand more . ... We were inundated for 3 @-@ 4 days , and then , once Alabama was selected to play in the game , we got a lot more calls , and we were sold out . " Some fans were able to obtain tickets at the game via purchases from ticket scalpers . 
 Demand for tickets by Alabama fans was so great that the Alabama ticket office accidentally oversold its allotment of tickets . The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season @-@ ticket holders , and the office received more than 25 @,@ 000 orders for its 12 @,@ 500 @-@ ticket allotment . An additional 2 @,@ 000 tickets were given to Alabama , but the school still had to send out more than 10 @,@ 000 refunds . Alabama 's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department . A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class @-@ action lawsuit against the athletic director , claiming contract violations .

 Despite having an offense that featured star running back Shaun Alexander , Alabama 's offensive strategy revolved around a passing offense more than a running one . During the regular season , Alabama passed for 2 @,@ 435 yards but only ran for 1 @,@ 272 yards . The Crimson Tide averaged 22 @.@ 9 points per game , 116 rushing yards per game , and 221 @.@ 4 passing yards per game . 
 A large reason for Alabama 's success passing the ball came from the emergence of freshman quarterback Andrew Zow , who assumed starting duties during the season . Zow completed 143 of 256 passes for 1 @,@ 969 yards , 11 touchdowns , and seven interceptions . One of his favorite passing targets was Alexander , who caught 26 passes for 385 yards and four touchdowns in addition to his 1 @,@ 178 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns . Alexander averaged 116 yards per game on the ground . Wide receiver Quincy Jackson was the team 's leading passing target . He caught 48 passes for 621 yards four touchdowns .

 Virginia Tech 's offense during the regular season was worse than the average in the NCAA during 1998 . The Hokies finished 88th among 112 Division I @-@ A teams in total offense , recording 316 @.@ 7 yards per game . Tech averaged 31 @.@ 2 points per game . 
 Part of the reason for their lackluster performance was repeated injuries to starting quarterback Al Clark , who missed three regular @-@ season games due to injuries . Heading into the Music City Bowl , he was recovering from a rib injury suffered in Tech 's final regular @-@ season game . Despite the missed games , Clark completed 72 of 148 passes for 1 @,@ 050 passing yards , nine touchdowns , and five interceptions for the 1998 season . On the ground , Virginia Tech running backs Lamont Pegues and Shyrone Stith combined for 1 @,@ 444 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns . Together , they averaged 178 yards per game on the ground . Another bright spot on the Virginia Tech offense was kicker Shayne Graham , who was named a first @-@ team All Big East selection .

 Defensively , Alabama allowed an average of 147 @.@ 7 rushing yards and 369 total yards per game . In total , Alabama 's defense intercepted 12 passes during the regular season and sacked opposing quarterbacks 25 times .

 At the conclusion of the regular season , the Virginia Tech defense was one of the best in the country .

 Virginia Tech 's coaching staff drew media attention when it was announced that Virginia Tech head football coach Frank Beamer was being actively recruited by Clemson to assume that school 's vacant head coaching job . Beamer was first contacted about the job during the regular season , and he was mentioned in connection with Clemson 's search throughout the final two weeks of the regular season . He also was mentioned as a possibility for South Carolina 's vacant head @-@ coaching job . Three days after Virginia Tech was selected for the Music City Bowl , Beamer ended speculation by publicly turning down Clemson and South Carolina . In exchange for publicly rebuffing the offers , Virginia Tech rewarded Beamer with financial additions to his contract and a contract extension through 2005 . 
 Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster also was targeted by other teams prior to the Music City Bowl . Rumors circulated about the University of Florida 's interest in hiring Foster to fill its defensive coordinator position , but Foster declined to comment until after Florida 's Jan. 2 Orange Bowl game . Foster proceeded through the interview process and was offered the job , but he turned it down in favor of remaining at Tech , which offered him contract incentives . 
 Alabama likewise underwent rumors of coaching changes . Shortly after the Music City Bowl matchup was announced , rumors spread that quarterbacks coach Charlie Stubbs or tight ends coach Ronnie Cottrell were being considered for other jobs . One departure rumor became reality when defensive line coach Jackie Shipp resigned to take the same position at the University of Oklahoma . Shipp 's departure left the Crimson Tide without a defensive line coach , and Alabama head coach Mike DuBose filled the vacancy for the Music City Bowl . 
 In the days prior to the game , both teams had to cope with harsh winter weather in the Nashville area . Virginia Tech was forced to move practices indoors when an ice storm arrived on the day before Christmas . The storm caused travel delays for fans and players alike . Alabama 's first practices in Nashville were held without the full team available because many players had been delayed . The harsh weather continued through the day of the game , and Tech was forced to cancel its final outdoor practice before the game . Alabama , meanwhile , drove 45 minutes to Murfreesboro to a practice field that was not covered by ice .

 In July 2008 , seven months after the death of Ledger , Williams began dating director Spike Jonze . They met on the set of Synecdoche , New York , which Williams starred in and Jonze produced . Williams called the timing of their relationship " impossible " , and ended it in September 2009 . In July 2015 , it was reported that Williams had begun dating author Jonathan Safran Foer .

 = HMS Formidable ( 67 ) = 
 HMS Formidable was an Illustrious @-@ class aircraft carrier ordered for the Royal Navy before World War II . After being completed in late 1940 , she was briefly assigned to the Home Fleet before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet as a replacement for her crippled sister ship Illustrious . Formidable 's aircraft played a key role in the Battle of Cape Matapan in early 1941 , and they subsequently provided cover for Allied ships and attacked Axis forces until their carrier was badly damaged by German dive bombers in May . 
 Assigned to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean in early 1942 , Formidable covered the invasion of Diego Suarez in Vichy Madagascar in mid @-@ 1942 against the possibility of a sortie by the Japanese into the Indian Ocean . Formidable returned home for a brief refit before participating in Operation Torch , the invasion of French North Africa in November . She remained in the Mediterranean and covered the invasions of Sicily and mainland Italy in 1943 before beginning a lengthy refit . 
 Formidable made several attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz in Norway in mid @-@ 1944 as part of the Home Fleet . She was subsequently assigned to the British Pacific Fleet ( BPF ) in 1945 where she played a supporting role during the Battle of Okinawa and later attacked targets in the Japanese Home Islands . The ship was used to repatriate liberated Allied prisoners of war and soldiers after the Japanese surrender and then ferried British personnel across the globe through 1946 . She was placed in reserve the following year and sold for scrap in 1953 . 
 = = Background and description = = 
 The Royal Navy 's 1936 Naval Programme authorised the construction of two aircraft carriers . Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson , Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy , was determined not to simply modify the previous unarmoured Ark Royal design . He believed that carriers could not be successfully defended by their own aircraft without some form of early @-@ warning system . Lacking that , there was nothing to prevent land @-@ based aircraft from attacking them , especially in confined waters like the North and Mediterranean Seas . This meant that the ship had to be capable of remaining in action after sustaining damage , and that her fragile aircraft had to be protected entirely from damage . The only way to do this was to completely armour the hangar in which the aircraft would shelter , but putting that much weight so high in the ship allowed only a single @-@ storey hangar due to stability concerns . This halved the aircraft capacity of the Illustrious class compared with the older unarmoured carriers , trading offensive potential for defensive survivability . 
 Formidable was 740 feet ( 225 @.@ 6 m ) in length overall and 710 feet ( 216 @.@ 4 m ) at the waterline . Her beam was 95 feet 9 inches ( 29 @.@ 2 m ) at the waterline and she had a draught of 28 feet 10 inches ( 8 @.@ 8 m ) at deep load . She displaced 23 @,@ 000 long tons ( 23 @,@ 369 t ) at standard load as completed . Her complement was approximately 1 @,@ 299 officers and enlisted men upon completion in 1940 . The ship had three Parsons geared steam turbines , each driving one shaft , using steam supplied by six Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 111 @,@ 000 shp ( 83 @,@ 000 kW ) , enough to give a maximum speed of 30 @.@ 5 knots ( 56 @.@ 5 km / h ; 35 @.@ 1 mph ) . On sea trials , Formidable reached speeds of 30 @.@ 6 knots ( 56 @.@ 7 km / h ; 35 @.@ 2 mph ) with 112 @,@ 018 shp ( 83 @,@ 532 kW ) . She carried a maximum of 4 @,@ 850 long tons ( 4 @,@ 930 t ) of fuel oil which gave her a range of 10 @,@ 700 nautical miles ( 19 @,@ 800 km ; 12 @,@ 300 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The 753 @-@ foot ( 229 @.@ 5 m ) armoured flight deck had a usable length of 670 feet ( 204 @.@ 2 m ) , due to prominent " round @-@ downs " at bow and stern to reduce air turbulence , and a maximum width of 95 feet ( 29 @.@ 0 m ) . A single hydraulic aircraft catapult was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck . The ship was equipped with two unarmoured lifts on the centreline , each of which measured 45 by 22 feet ( 13 @.@ 7 by 6 @.@ 7 m ) . The hangar was 456 feet ( 139 @.@ 0 m ) long and had a maximum width of 62 feet ( 18 @.@ 9 m ) . It had a height of 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) which allowed storage of Lend @-@ Lease Vought F4U Corsair fighters once their wingtips were clipped . The ship could accommodate up to 54 aircraft rather than the intended 36 after the adoption of " outriggers " on the flight deck during the war and the flattening of the " round @-@ downs " that increased the usable length of the flight deck to 740 feet ( 225 @.@ 6 m ) to facilitate the use of a permanent deck park . The additional crewmen , maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support the extra aircraft severely crowded the ship . She was provided with 50 @,@ 650 imperial gallons ( 230 @,@ 300 l ; 60 @,@ 830 US gal ) of aviation gasoline . 
 = = = Armament , electronics and protection = = = 
 The ship 's main armament consisted of sixteen quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 110 mm ) dual @-@ purpose guns in eight twin @-@ gun turrets that were mounted in sponsons on the side of the hull . The roofs of the gun turrets protruded above the level of the flight deck to allow them to fire across the deck at high elevations . The gun had a maximum range of 20 @,@ 760 yards ( 18 @,@ 980 m ) . Her light anti @-@ aircraft defences included six octuple mounts for QF two @-@ pounder ( " pom @-@ pom " ) anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns , two each fore and aft of the island and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull . The two @-@ pounder gun had a maximum range of 6 @,@ 800 yards ( 6 @,@ 200 m ) . 
 While under repair in late 1941 , Formidable 's light AA armament was augmented by the addition of 10 Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon in single mounts with a maximum range of 4 @,@ 800 yards ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) . By the time of her last recorded refit in March 1944 , she had exchanged one octuple " pom @-@ pom " mount for a quadruple mount and had a total of 20 twin and 14 single 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) mounts . Before seeing combat against the Japanese some were replaced by 40 mm Bofors AA guns as the 20 mm shell was unlikely to destroy a kamikaze before it hit the ship . The Bofors gun had a maximum range of 10 @,@ 750 yards ( 9 @,@ 830 m ) . By the war 's end the ship had all six of her original octuple " pom @-@ pom " mounts , five single power @-@ operated 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) mounts , seven single 40 mm " <unk> " mounts and 11 twin and 12 single 20 mm mounts . 
 Formidable was completed with a Type 79 early @-@ warning radar . The specifics of the additional radars fitted during the war are not readily available , but she probably had , by the end of the war , a Type 277 surface @-@ search / height @-@ finding radar on top of the bridge and a Type 293 target @-@ indicator radar on the foremast . She also probably mounted Type 279 and Type 281B early @-@ warning radars , based on those fitted aboard her sister ship Victorious . In addition , Type 282 and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the fire @-@ control directors . 
 The Illustrious @-@ class ships had a flight deck protected by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armour and the internal sides and ends of the hangars were 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick . The hangar deck itself was 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick and extended the full width of the ship to meet the top of the 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch waterline armour belt . The belt was closed by 2 @.@ 5 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft . The underwater defence system was a layered system of liquid- and air @-@ filled compartments backed by a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 38 mm ) splinter bulkhead .

 Formidable was ordered as part of the 1937 Naval Programme from Harland & Wolff . She was laid down at their Belfast shipyard on 17 June 1937 as yard number 1007 and launched on 17 August 1939 . Just before the launch ceremony was to begin , the wooden cradle supporting the ship collapsed , and the ship slid down the slipway while workmen were still underneath and around the ship . One spectator was killed by flying debris and at least 20 others were injured ; Formidable , however , was not damaged . Because of the incident , the carrier was referred to as " The Ship That Launched Herself " . She was commissioned on 24 November 1940 . 
 After a very brief work up , the Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of 826 and 829 Squadrons and the Fairey Fulmar fighters of 803 Squadron flew aboard and she joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow on 12 December . Her stay there was brief as she , escorted by the heavy cruisers Dorsetshire and Norfolk , sailed on 18 December to protect convoys and search for the German cruiser Admiral Scheer which had recently attacked Convoy HX 84 in the North Atlantic . They failed to find the commerce raider and escorted a convoy to Cape Town , South Africa , arriving on 22 January 1941 . Four days later the ship was ordered north to replace her sister Illustrious with the Mediterranean Fleet after she had been badly damaged by German dive bombers . En route , she took the opportunity to attack Italian forces in Italian Somaliland and Eritrea . They sank the 5 @,@ 723 @-@ gross register ton ( GRT ) steamer SS Moncalieri on 12 February for the loss of two Albacores . 
 = = = Battle of Cape Matapan = = = 
 Several weeks later , she made a cautious transit of the recently mined Suez Canal and reached Alexandria on 10 March . 829 Squadron was issued Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers to replace its losses around this time . On 20 March Formidable escorted a convoy to Malta and flew off five aircraft for Crete while returning to Alexandria . On the morning of 27 March , major elements of the Italian Fleet were spotted en route to the sea lanes between Egypt and Greece and the carrier sailed later that afternoon to intercept them . Reinforced by three Fulmars from 806 Squadron , her air group only numbered 13 Fulmars , 10 Albacores and 4 Swordfish . An Albacore spotted the leading Italian ships the next morning ; a strike force of six Albacores was loaded with torpedoes and began to attack the Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto . Two German Junkers Ju 88 bombers intervened , but they were driven off by the escorting pair of Fulmars . The attack was unsuccessful and another strike force of three Albacores and two Swordfish was prepared . Shortly after launching them at 12 : 22 , Formidable was unsuccessfully attacked by a pair of torpedo @-@ carrying Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 bombers . Around 14 : 50 , one Albacore succeeded in torpedoing the Italian battleship , although the other aircraft missed . The hit briefly knocked out her engines and caused heavy flooding . Another air strike of six Albacores and two Swordfish was launched at 17 : 30 to finish off the crippled battleship , but they mistook the Italian cruiser Pola for the battleship in the fading light . The cruiser was struck by a single torpedo from one of the aircraft , possibly from one of two Swordfish from 815 Squadron from Maleme , Crete , that linked up with Formidable 's aircraft before the attack . The mistake allowed the battleship to reach port . One Albacore was shot down by Vittorio Veneto and two others were forced to ditch after running out of fuel during the day 's operations . 
 On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard the primary Axis supply port of Tripoli and was attacked by a pair of torpedo @-@ carrying SM.79s from Rhodes . They were intercepted by a pair of Fulmars that damaged one bomber badly enough that it crash @-@ landed back at its base , although one Fulmar was also forced to crash @-@ land aboard Formidable . The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily and a pair of Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa . On the morning of 21 April , the carrier 's aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port so it could be shelled by three battleships and a light cruiser . On the way home , a pair of Fulmars shot down a Dornier Do 24 flying boat . 
 During the Evacuation of Greece , Formidable provided air cover for Convoy GA @-@ 15 on 29 April . A Fulmar from 803 Squadron was forced to ditch on 2 May before the carrier returned to Alexandria the next day . She put to sea on 6 May to provide air cover for the convoys involved in Operation Tiger . On the morning of 8 May , a pair of Fulmars claimed to have shot down a pair of <unk> searching for the fleet ; one Fulmar failed to return . Later that afternoon , the fighters shot down four German Heinkel He 111 bombers at the cost of one Fulmar forced to crash @-@ land . Two Albacores and a Fulmar crashed due to non @-@ combat causes during the day . The next day a pair of Fulmars from 806 Squadron badly damaged a Ju 88 reconnaissance bomber that crash @-@ landed at its base in Sicily . As the fleet and the Tiger convoy approached Alexandria on 11 May , a pair of Fulmars attacked a formation of Ju 88s , damaging one bomber ; one Fulmar and another Ju 88 were seen falling together towards the sea . Many of the Fulmars had been rendered unserviceable during the operation and Formidable was unable to provide air cover until they were repaired . 
 On 26 May the fleet sortied for a dawn raid on the base at Scarpanto the next day ; the carrier could only muster a total of 12 Fulmars and 15 Albacores and Swordfish . Six Albacores and four Fulmars attacked the airbase , destroying one Ju 88 and damaging two others . Also damaged were an Italian Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.81 transport and six Fiat CR.42 fighters . Later that morning , as the fleet was returning to Egypt , the Fulmars shot down a He 111 and two Ju 88s for the loss of one Fulmar forced to land aboard the carrier and another forced to ditch . At 13 : 10 a formation of Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers was spotted from I. / StG 2 ; based in Cyrenica , they were searching for supply ships bound for Tobruk and not involved in the Battle of Crete . They hit Formidable with two 500 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) bombs and blew the bow off her escorting destroyer Nubian . The bombs killed 12 men and wounded 10 ; one bomb passed completely through the outer part of the starboard forward flight deck and detonated before it hit the water , riddling the side of the hull with holes . A near miss also blew a large hole in the ship 's starboard side underwater . The pair of Fulmars on Combat Air Patrol ( CAP ) shot down one of the Stukas after it had dropped its bomb and were able to land aboard shortly afterwards , although takeoffs could not be made until 18 : 00 . 
 Formidable arrived at Alexandria the following day and disembarked her air group . She received emergency repairs before departing on 24 July for permanent repairs at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in the United States , 829 Squadron flying aboard with its Albacores to provide anti @-@ submarine patrols during the voyage . She arrived on 25 August and the repairs were completed in early December . After several days of sea trials , she sailed for Britain in company with Illustrious on 12 December . During the night of 15 / 16 December , Illustrious collided with Formidable 's stern , but neither ship was seriously damaged . She was repaired at Belfast from 21 December 1941 to 3 February 1942 and embarked the Albacores of 818 and 820 Squadrons and the Grumman Martlet fighters of 888 Squadron . 
 = = = Indian Ocean Raid = = = 
 Formidable sailed on 17 February to join the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean , escorting a convoy to Freetown , Sierra Leone , en route . One of her passengers on the voyage was Admiral Sir James Somerville , about to take up his appointment as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Eastern Fleet . The ship arrived at Colombo , Ceylon , on 24 March and Somerville hoisted his flag aboard the battleship Warspite that same day . Two days after Formidable 's arrival , the Japanese First Air Fleet departed from Celebes ( Sulawesi ) in the Dutch East Indies to attack British forces in the Indian Ocean . Somerville was notified that the Japanese were planning on attacking Ceylon on 28 March and ordered his fleet to assemble southeast of the island on 30 March to intercept them . Force A , consisting of Formidable , her sister Indomitable and Warspite , was ordered to Addu Atoll to refuel on 3 April after the Japanese failed to attack as the British expected . A Royal Air Force Consolidated Catalina flying boat spotted them within range of Ceylon just three and a half hours after Force A arrived at the atoll on 4 April . Too far away to intercept them before they could attack Ceylon , Force A departed about eleven hours after arrival on a course that Somerville thought would allow him to attack by night while avoiding detection during the day . One of Indomitable 's Albacores spotted some of the Japanese carriers just before nightfall on 5 April , after the Japanese attacked Colombo , but further searches failed to locate them until 8 April when the Japanese were one day away from their intended target , Trincomalee , and still too far away to intercept . Force A refuelled at Addu Atoll on 9 April and was then ordered to Bombay to calm fears of a Japanese attack on India 's west coast . 
 Somerville was still uneasy about the possibility of another attack on Ceylon and ordered Force A to Kilindini Harbour , Mombasa , Kenya on 24 April . En route ( 5 – 7 May ) , she helped protect the invasion of Vichy Diego Suarez , Madagascar against a Japanese attack . Formidable arrived at Kilindini on 10 May and remained there until she departed on 29 May bound for Colombo . The ship alternated between Colombo and Kilindini for the rest of her time with the Eastern Fleet . Rear @-@ Admiral Denis Boyd hoisted his flag over the ship on 24 August and she departed six days later to return home for a refit . She arrived at Rosyth on 21 September and her refit lasted until 18 October . She sailed that day for Scapa Flow where she embarked 24 Martlets of 888 and 893 Squadrons , 12 Albacores of 820 Squadron and 6 Supermarine Seafire fighters of 885 Squadron in preparation for the invasion of French North Africa . 
 = = = Operation Torch = = = 
 Assigned to Force H for Operation Torch , Formidable sailed on 30 October and provided cover in the Western Mediterranean against any attempt to interfere with the landings by Axis forces in Italy or France . Her Martlets shot down a pair of Ju 88s on 6 November and her Albacores laid a smoke screen in support of the landings at Algiers on 8 November . Two of her Albacores torpedoed and sank the German submarine U @-@ 331 on 17 November after it had surrendered to a Supermarine Walrus amphibian once the Walrus had departed to find a ship to accept the surrender . She remained off the Algerian coast providing air support for Allied forces for the rest of the month , and one of her Seafires shot down a Ju 88 on 28 November . 
 Formidable was the only carrier in the Mediterranean after Torch until she was joined by Indomitable in mid @-@ June 1943 as part of the buildup for the Allied invasion of Sicily ( Operation Husky ) . The two carriers were east of the island in a position to intercept any attempt by the Italian fleet to attack the landings . After Sicily was secured , Formidable became the first carrier to enter Grand Harbour , Malta , since Illustrious in January 1941 . The latter ship joined Formidable as a replacement for the torpedoed Indomitable in Force H for the landings at Salerno ( Operation Avalanche ) on 9 September . As in Husky , their role was to protect the invasion fleet from interference by the Italian Navy . The fighters aboard the smaller carriers protecting the forces ashore suffered heavy attrition during the early days of the operation and Formidable transferred 2 Seafires and 15 Martlets to Unicorn as replacements for their losses . 
 = = = Norwegian operations = = = 
 In October , the carrier was transferred to the Home Fleet and departed Gibraltar for Greenock on 13 October together with the battleship King George V. Six days later she was in Scapa Flow to begin patrols to Iceland in company with the battleships Howe and Anson and the American carrier Ranger that lasted for the next three weeks . On 13 November she flew off her air group and sailed for Belfast to begin a lengthy refit , arriving on 19 November . The refit was completed in early June and the ship spent the rest of the month working up . The 18 Corsairs of 1841 Squadron and the 24 Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 827 and 830 Squadrons flew aboard on 29 June and Formidable sailed for Scapa Flow to train with the carriers Furious and Indefatigable before launching an attack on the Tirpitz in Kaafjord on 17 July ( Operation Mascot ) . Her Corsairs escorted the strike aircraft from the other carriers to the target ; one was shot down by German flak . A smoke screen prevented most of the Barracudas from seeing their target and they failed to hit the Tirpitz . Upon the ship 's return to Scapa Flow , 827 and 830 Squadrons were replaced by 826 and 828 Squadrons , also flying Barracudas . 
 Formidable 's air group was reinforced by a dozen Corsairs of 1842 Squadron on 7 August in preparation for further attacks on Tirpitz ( Operation Goodwood ) . The two Corsair squadrons were assigned to No. 6 Naval Fighter Wing aboard the carrier on 14 August . The first attack was on the morning of 22 August when Formidable launched 24 Corsairs and 12 Barracudas against the German battleship and nearby targets , all of which returned . A smoke screen again protected the Tirpitz and no damage was inflicted . Another attack scheduled for the afternoon had to be cancelled because of low clouds . A further attack could not be mounted until 24 August because of bad weather . The carrier contributed 23 Corsairs and 16 Barracudas , and 3 of the fighters were shot down over the target . The Tirpitz was lightly damaged by two bomb hits during this attack . A final attack was made five days later , again without effect . 
 The carrier arrived at Scapa Flow on 2 September where both Barracuda squadrons disembarked . She later sailed to Gibraltar , arriving on 21 September to begin a refit that , among other things , augmented her anti @-@ aircraft outfit in preparation for operations in the Pacific . The Corsairs of No. 6 Naval Fighter Wing flew aboard on 1 January 1945 , as did 18 Grumman TBF Avengers of 848 Squadron . After several weeks of working up , Formidable departed Gibraltar on 14 January to join the British Pacific Fleet ( BPF ) . She arrived in Sydney , the BPF 's main base , on 10 March after several stops en route to refuel and embark stores and ammunition . On 20 March , Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser , commander of the BPF , inspected the ship and her crew . 
 = = = Pacific operations = = = 
 By this time Formidable 's air group had a strength of 36 Corsairs and 18 Avengers . She arrived in San Pedro Bay in the Philippines on 4 April to await the return of the BPF from their efforts to neutralise airfields on the Sakishima Islands , between Okinawa and Formosa , as part of the preparations for the landings on Okinawa . Formidable was called forward six days later to join the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron ( 1st ACS ) of the BPF on operations as a replacement for Illustrious which was in poor mechanical shape . She arrived on 14 April and contributed aircraft when the attacks recommenced two days later . The commander of 1842 Squadron was killed on the first day of operations while strafing buildings at Nobara airfield . After refuelling and two more days ' attacks , the BPF sailed on 20 April for San Pedro Bay to replenish its ships for further operations . 
 The fleet returned to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its attacks on the airfields on the Sakishima Islands . Vice @-@ Admiral Bernard Rawlings , second in command of the BPF , and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack . They detached King George V and Howe , as well as five cruisers , that morning to bombard Nobara and <unk> airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells . The loss of the most effective anti @-@ aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were able to take advantage of the opportunity . The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment @-@ spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11 : 31 . The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidable 's guns could open fire and then turned sharply to dive into the forward flight deck despite the ship 's hard turn to starboard . The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb 's blast , although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable . 
 The detonation of the bomb blew a 2 @-@ by @-@ 2 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 6 by 0 @.@ 6 m ) hole in the flight deck . It killed 2 officers and 6 enlisted men , wounding 55 other crewmen . A fragment from the flight deck armour penetrated the hangar deck armour and passed through the centre boiler uptakes , the centre boiler room itself , and an oil tank before it came to rest in the inner bottom . The fragment severed the steam pipes in the centre boiler room and forced its evacuation , cutting the ship 's speed to 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . The blast on the flight deck blew the Avenger closest to it over the side and set another one on fire . Shrapnel from the blast peppered the island , causing the bulk of the casualties , and severed many electrical cables , including those for most of the ship 's radars . The fires on the flight deck and in the hangar were extinguished by 11 : 55 , and seven Avengers and a Corsair which were damaged beyond repair were dumped over the side . The bomb struck at the intersection of three armour plates and dented the plates over an area 20 by 24 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 by 7 @.@ 3 m ) . The dent was filled by wood and concrete and covered by thin steel plates tack @-@ welded to the deck so that she was able to operate aircraft by 17 : 00 and steam at a speed of 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) . Thirteen of her Corsairs had been airborne at the time of the attack and they operated from the other carriers for a time . The damage to the boiler room and its steam pipes was repaired so that the centre boilers could be reconnected to the engines at 02 : 00 the next day . 
 The bombardment significantly reduced Japanese aerial activity on 5 May , although several of Formidable 's Corsairs , temporarily operating from her sister Victorious , shot down a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft at an altitude of 30 @,@ 000 feet ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) . That evening the fleet withdrew to refuel and was back on station on 8 May although heavy rains forced the cancellation of the planned air strikes . Another kamikaze penetrated the CAP at low altitude and struck Formidable 's flight deck and deck park at 17 : 05 on 9 May . The impact did little damage to the ship , but caused an explosion and large fire that destroyed 18 of her aircraft . Casualties were light with only one man killed and four wounded . The carrier was able to resume operations fifty minutes later , but with only four Avengers and eleven Corsairs still serviceable . Rawlings decided to immediately withdraw to give Victorious and Formidable more time to make repairs and to replenish their depleted air groups . He also revised the deployment of the BPF to counter the new low @-@ level tactics of the Japanese by stationing the battleships and cruisers more closely to the carriers , keeping the carriers closer together and positioning radar picket cruisers in the most likely directions of attack . 
 The BPF returned to action on 12 May and no Japanese aircraft were seen or detected that day or the next . One of Formidable 's Avengers made a successful landing aboard Indomitable with only one landing gear leg extended and no flaps on 13 May . The BPF continued its routine of two days of operations alternating with one or two days to replenish its ships for the next several days with minimal interference by the Japanese . On the morning of 18 May , armourers were loading ammunition into aircraft when a Corsair 's guns were accidentally fired into an Avenger which caught fire . The overhead fire sprinklers were immediately turned on , but the fire could not be extinguished for nearly an hour , not least because the electric motors driving the steel fire curtains had been damaged in the first kamikaze attack and could only be repaired by a dockyard . Twenty @-@ one Corsairs and seven Avengers were either damaged or destroyed in the incident . Rawlings decided to detach Formidable early to give her extra time for repairs in Sydney and she was ordered to depart on 22 May . 
 = = = = Operations off the Japanese coast = = = = 
 The ship arrived on 31 May and was taken into the Captain Cook Dock at the Garden Island Dockyard for repairs , with the dock 's labour force being augmented with workers from the Cockatoo Island Dockyard . Two of the three armour plates damaged on 4 May were repaired , but the third had to be replaced by two 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch high @-@ quality steel plates as there were not any armour plates of the required thickness available in Australia . Repairs were also made to the ship 's machinery , boilers and electrical systems . The island was enlarged with an admiral 's staff cabin and a radar workshop . Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Philip Vian , commander of the 1st ACS , transferred his flag to Formidable when her repairs were complete . 
 Together with Victorious and King George V , Formidable departed Sydney on 28 June , bound for the BPF 's advance base at Manus Island , in the Admiralty Islands . Her air group now consisted of 36 Corsairs , 12 Avengers and 6 Grumman F6F Hellcats of 1844 Squadron . Two of the latter aircraft were photoreconnaissance versions . No. 6 Naval Fighter Wing was absorbed into the 2nd Carrier Air Group that controlled all of the aircraft on the carrier . The ships arrived on 4 July , refuelled , and departed two days later to join the American Third Fleet , already operating off the Japanese Home Islands . The BPF rendezvoused with the Americans on 16 July and commenced operations the next morning . Formidable flew off 28 Corsairs bound north of Tokyo on 17 July , but some of them were unable to locate their targets because of bad weather . Twenty @-@ four Corsairs attacked targets near Tokyo the next day , before more bad weather halted flying operations until 24 – 25 July , when the BPF 's aircraft attacked targets near Osaka and the Inland Sea , crippling the escort carrier Kaiyo . After replenishing , airstrikes resumed on 28 and 30 July , sinking the escort Okinawa near Maizuru . A combination of bad weather , refuelling requirements and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima delayed the resumption of air operations until 9 August . 
 During the morning , Formidable flew off a fighter sweep of a dozen Corsairs followed an hour later by Avengers that attacked Matsushima Air Field . A second fighter sweep , led by Lieutenant Robert Hampton Gray , RCNVR , senior pilot of 1841 Squadron , was diverted to attack Japanese warships located in <unk> Wan , Miyagi Prefecture , with his eight Corsairs . Gray spotted two escort ships and led his aircraft into the attack . Intense flak set his engine on fire , but Gray continued his attack , skip bombing a 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bomb into the Etorofu @-@ class escort Amakusa . The ship sank within five minutes with the loss of 157 lives . Gray 's aircraft rolled inverted shortly after releasing the bomb and crashed into the sea ; he did not survive . Gray was later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross ( VC ) . 
 The attacks were repeated the next day , sinking two warships and numerous small merchantmen and destroying numerous railroad locomotives and parked aircraft . The BPF had been scheduled to withdraw after 10 August to prepare for Operation Olympic , the invasion of Kyushu scheduled for November , and the bulk of the force , including Formidable , departed for Manus on 12 August . The Japanese surrender a few days later ended the war .

 Formidable arrived at Sydney on 24 August , and had her hangar refitted to accommodate Allied ex @-@ prisoners of war and soldiers for repatriation . Having left her air group behind to maximise the numbers of passengers she could carry , the ship arrived at Manila on 30 September , where she loaded over 1 @,@ 000 Australian former prisoners of war on 4 October and unloaded them at Circular Quay in Sydney on 21 October . She departed three days later , bound for Karavia Bay , New Britain where she loaded 1 @,@ 254 men of the Indian Army and continued on to Singapore where she loaded Indian ex @-@ PoWs before delivering them to Bombay . There Formidable loaded an Indian Army infantry battalion for transport to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies to maintain law and order until Dutch colonial troops could take over . The ship then loaded elements of the 7th Australian Division and their equipment at Tarakan Island , Borneo and picked up more Australians at Morotai ; she arrived at Sydney on 6 December . 
 Vice @-@ Admiral Vian addressed the ship 's crew on 27 December before she departed the following day with 800 naval personnel embarked for passage home . She arrived at Portsmouth on 5 February 1946 . The dockyard there fitted her with more permanent accommodations in the hangar for more trooping duties and she loaded 480 personnel before departing for Sydney on 2 March . Formidable arrived there a month later and loaded 1 @,@ 336 naval personnel as well as some Wrens and VAD nurses . She sailed on 12 April , stopping in Colombo to refuel and drop off 576 naval personnel , before arriving in Devonport on 9 May . She made her next voyage to Bombay and Colombo between 15 June and 25 July . The ship loaded 114 officers , 958 enlisted men and 11 VAD nurses in Singapore in August and another 319 enlisted men in Trincomalee before stopping in Malta to load 41 men of the Merchant Navy . Formidable made her last trooping voyage between Portsmouth and Singapore , delivering 1 @,@ 000 Royal Marine Commandos to the latter , between 3 December and 3 February 1947 .

 In early March 1947 , Formidable steamed north to Rosyth for a brief refit before being reduced to reserve .

She was towed to Spithead in mid @-@ 1949 and then to Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in November 1952 . Formidable was sold for scrap in January 1953 and towed to Inverkeithing where she was broken up .

 = Beck Depression Inventory = 
 The Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI , BDI @-@ 1A , BDI @-@ II ) , created by Aaron T. Beck , is a 21 @-@ question multiple @-@ choice self @-@ report inventory , one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression . Its development marked a shift among mental health professionals , who had until then , viewed depression from a psychodynamic perspective , instead of it being rooted in the patient 's own thoughts . 
 In its current version , the BDI @-@ II is designed for individuals aged 13 and over , and is composed of items relating to symptoms of depression such as hopelessness and irritability , cognitions such as guilt or feelings of being punished , as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue , weight loss , and lack of interest in sex . 
 There are three versions of the BDI — the original BDI , first published in 1961 and later revised in 1978 as the BDI @-@ 1A , and the BDI @-@ II , published in 1996 . The BDI is widely used as an assessment tool by health care professionals and researchers in a variety of settings . 
 The BDI was used as a model for the development of the Children 's Depression Inventory ( CDI ) , first published in 1979 by clinical psychologist Maria Kovacs . 
 = = Development and history = = 
 Historically , depression was described in psychodynamic terms as " inverted hostility against the self " . By contrast , the BDI was developed in a novel way for its time ; by collating patients ' verbatim descriptions of their symptoms and then using these to structure a scale which could reflect the intensity or severity of a given symptom . 
 Beck drew attention to the importance of " negative cognitions " described as sustained , inaccurate , and often intrusive negative thoughts about the self . In his view , it was the case that these cognitions caused depression , rather than being generated by depression . 
 Beck developed a triad of negative cognitions about the world , the future , and the self , which play a major role in depression . An example of the triad in action taken from Brown ( 1995 ) is the case of a student obtaining poor exam results : 
 The student has negative thoughts about the world , so he may come to believe he does not enjoy the class . 
 The student has negative thoughts about his future , because he thinks he may not pass the class . 
 The student has negative thoughts about his self , as he may feel he does not deserve to be in college . 
 The development of the BDI reflects that in its structure , with items such as " I have lost all of my interest in other people " to reflect the world , " I feel discouraged about the future " to reflect the future , and " I blame myself for everything bad that happens " to reflect the self . The view of depression as sustained by intrusive negative cognitions has had particular application in cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , which aims to challenge and neutralize them through techniques such as cognitive restructuring . 
 = = = BDI = = = 
 The original BDI , first published in 1961 , consisted of twenty @-@ one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week . Each question has a set of at least four possible responses , ranging in intensity . For example : 
 ( 0 ) I do not feel sad . 
 ( 1 ) I feel sad . 
 ( 2 ) I am sad all the time and I can 't snap out of it . 
 ( 3 ) I am so sad or unhappy that I can 't stand it . 
 When the test is scored , a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression 's severity . The standard cut @-@ off scores are as follows : 
 0 – 9 : indicates minimal depression 
 10 – 18 : indicates mild depression 
 19 – 29 : indicates moderate depression 
 30 – 63 : indicates severe depression . 
 Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms . 
 Some items on the BDI have more than one statement marked with the same score . For instance , there are two responses under the Mood heading that score a 2 : ( 2a ) I am blue or sad all the time and I can 't snap out of it and ( 2b ) I am so sad or unhappy that it is very painful . 
 = = = BDI @-@ IA = = = 
 The BDI @-@ IA was a revision of the original instrument developed by Beck during the 1970s , and copyrighted in 1978 . To improve ease of use , the " a and b statements " described above were removed , and respondents were instructed to endorse how they had been feeling during the preceding two weeks . The internal consistency for the BDI @-@ IA was good , with a <unk> 's alpha coefficient of around 0 @.@ 85 , meaning that the items on the inventory are highly correlated with each other . 
 However , this version retained some flaws ; the BDI @-@ IA only addressed six out of the nine DSM @-@ III criteria for depression . This and other criticisms were addressed in the BDI @-@ II . 
 = = = BDI @-@ II = = = 
 The BDI @-@ II was a 1996 revision of the BDI , developed in response to the American Psychiatric Association 's publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition , which changed many of the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder . 
 Items involving changes in body image , <unk> , and difficulty working were replaced . Also , sleep loss and appetite loss items were revised to assess both increases and decreases in sleep and appetite . All but three of the items were reworded ; only the items dealing with feelings of being punished , thoughts about suicide , and interest in sex remained the same . Finally , participants were asked to rate how they have been feeling for the past two weeks , as opposed to the past week as in the original BDI . 
 Like the BDI , the BDI @-@ II also contains 21 questions , each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3 . Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms . The standardized cutoffs used differ from the original : 
 0 – 13 : minimal depression 
 14 – 19 : mild depression 
 20 – 28 : moderate depression 
 29 – 63 : severe depression . 
 One measure of an instrument 's usefulness is to see how closely it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician . In this respect , the BDI @-@ II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0 @.@ 71 , showing good agreement . The test was also shown to have a high one @-@ week test – <unk> reliability ( Pearson r = 0 @.@ 93 ) , suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood . The test also has high internal consistency ( α = .91 ) . 
 = = Two @-@ factor approach to depression = = 
 Depression can be thought of as having two components : the affective component ( e.g. mood ) and the physical or " somatic " component ( e.g. loss of appetite ) . The BDI @-@ II reflects this and can be separated into two subscales . The purpose of the subscales is to help determine the primary cause of a patient 's depression . 
 The affective <unk> contains eight items : pessimism , past failures , guilty feelings , punishment feelings , self @-@ dislike , self @-@ <unk> , suicidal thoughts or wishes , and worthlessness . The somatic <unk> consists of the other thirteen items : sadness , loss of pleasure , crying , agitation , loss of interest , indecisiveness , loss of energy , change in sleep patterns , irritability , change in appetite , concentration difficulties , tiredness and / or fatigue , and loss of interest in sex . The two subscales were moderately correlated at 0 @.@ 57 , suggesting that the physical and psychological aspects of depression are related rather than totally distinct . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The development of the BDI was an important event in psychiatry and psychology ; it represented a shift in health care professionals ' view of depression from a Freudian , psychodynamic perspective , to one guided by the patient 's own thoughts or " cognitions " . It also established the principle that instead of attempting to develop a psychometric tool based on a possibly invalid theory , self @-@ report questionnaires when analysed using techniques such as factor analysis can suggest theoretical constructs . 
 The BDI was originally developed to provide a quantitative assessment of the intensity of depression . Because it is designed to reflect the depth of depression , it can monitor changes over time and provide an objective measure for judging improvement and the effectiveness or otherwise of treatment methods . The instrument remains widely used in research ; in 1998 , it had been used in over 2000 empirical studies . It has been translated into multiple European languages as well as Arabic , Chinese , Japanese , Persian , and Xhosa . 
 = = Limitations = = 
 The BDI suffers from the same problems as other self @-@ report inventories , in that scores can be easily exaggerated or minimized by the person completing them . Like all questionnaires , the way the instrument is administered can have an effect on the final score . If a patient is asked to fill out the form in front of other people in a clinical environment , for instance , social expectations have been shown to elicit a different response compared to administration via a postal survey . 
 In participants with concomitant physical illness the BDI 's reliance on physical symptoms such as fatigue may artificially inflate scores due to symptoms of the illness , rather than of depression . In an effort to deal with this concern Beck and his colleagues developed the " Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care " ( BDI @-@ PC ) , a short screening scale consisting of seven items from the BDI @-@ II considered to be independent of physical function . Unlike the standard BDI , the BDI @-@ PC produces only a binary outcome of " not depressed " or " depressed " for patients above a cutoff score of 4 . 
 Although designed as a screening device rather than a diagnostic tool , the BDI is sometimes used by health care providers to reach a quick diagnosis . 
 The BDI is copyrighted , a fee must be paid for each copy used , and photocopying it is a violation of copyright . There is no evidence that the BDI @-@ II is more valid or reliable than other depression scales , and public domain scales such as the Patient Health Questionnaire – Nine Item ( <unk> @-@ 9 ) have been studied as a useful tool . 
 = Lennie Tristano = 
 Leonard Joseph " Lennie " Tristano ( March 19 , 1919 – November 18 , 1978 ) was an American jazz pianist , composer , arranger , and teacher of jazz improvisation . 
 Tristano studied for bachelor 's and master 's degrees in music in Chicago before moving to New York City in 1946 . He played with leading bebop musicians and formed his own small bands , which soon displayed some of his early interests – contrapuntal interaction of instruments , harmonic flexibility , and rhythmic complexity . His quintet in 1949 recorded the first free group improvisations . Tristano 's innovations continued in 1951 , with the first overdubbed , improvised jazz recordings , and two years later , when he recorded an atonal improvised solo piano piece that was based on the development of motifs rather than on harmonies . He developed further via polyrhythms and chromaticism into the 1960s , but was infrequently recorded . 
 Tristano started teaching music , especially improvisation , in the early 1940s , and by the mid @-@ 1950s was concentrating on teaching in preference to performing . He taught in a structured and disciplined manner , which was unusual in jazz education when he began . His educational role over three decades meant that he exerted an influence on jazz through his students , including saxophonists Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh . 
 Musicians and critics vary in their appraisal of Tristano as a musician . Some describe his playing as cold and suggest that his innovations had little impact ; others state that he was a bridge between bebop and later , freer forms of jazz , and assert that he is less appreciated than he should be because commentators found him hard to categorize and because he chose not to commercialize . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Tristano was born in Chicago on March 19 , 1919 . His mother , Rose Tristano ( née <unk> ) , was also born in Chicago . His father , Michael Joseph Tristano , was born in Italy and moved to the United States as a child . Lennie was the second of four brothers . 
 Lennie started on the family 's player piano at the age of two or three . He had classical piano lessons when he was eight , but indicated later that they had hindered , rather than helped , his development . He was born with weak eyesight , possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918 – 19 flu pandemic during pregnancy . A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition , and by the age of nine or ten he was totally blind as a result of glaucoma . He initially went to standard state schools , but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928 . During his school days he played several instruments , including saxophones , trumpet , guitar , and drums . At the age of eleven he had his first gigs , playing clarinet in a brothel . 
 Tristano studied for a bachelor 's degree in music in performance at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago from 1938 until 1941 , and stayed for another two years for further studies , although he left before completing his master 's degree . One of his aunts assisted Tristano by taking notes for him at university .

 = = = 1940s = = = 
 In the early 1940s Tristano played tenor saxophone and piano for a variety of engagements , including in a rumba band . He began giving private music lessons at around the same time , including to saxophonist Lee Konitz . From 1943 Tristano also taught at the Axel Christensen School of Popular Music . He first received press coverage for his piano playing in early 1944 , appearing in Metronome 's summary of music in Chicago from that year , and then in Down Beat from 1945 . He recorded with some musicians from Woody Herman 's band in 1945 ; Tristano 's playing on these tracks " is characterized by his extended harmonies , fast single @-@ line runs , and block chords . " He also recorded solo piano pieces in the same year . Tristano also married in 1945 ; his wife was Judy Moore , a musician who sang to his piano accompaniment in Chicago in the mid @-@ 1940s . 
 Tristano 's interest in jazz inspired a move to New York City in 1946 . As a preliminary step to moving there , he stayed in Freeport , Long Island , where he played in a restaurant with Arnold Fishkin ( bass ) and Billy Bauer ( guitar ) . This trio , with an assortment of bassists replacing Fishkin , was recorded in 1946 – 47 . Reviewers at the time commented on the originality of the piano – guitar counterpoint and the trio 's approach to harmony . Gunther Schuller later described one of their recordings as " too far ahead of its time " in its harmonic freedom and rhythmic complexity . 
 Tristano first met saxophonist Charlie Parker in 1947 . They played together in bands that included bebop musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach later that year for radio broadcasts . The pianist reported that Parker enjoyed his playing , in part because it was different from what Parker was accustomed to and did not copy the saxophonist 's style . In 1948 Tristano played less often in clubs , and added Konitz and a drummer to his regular band , making it into a quintet . This band recorded the first sides for the New Jazz label , which later became Prestige Records . Later that year Warne Marsh , another saxophonist student of Tristano 's , was added to the group . 
 Tristano 's band had two recording sessions in 1949 that proved to be significant . The sextet recorded original compositions , including his " Wow " and " <unk> " , that were based on familiar harmonies ; reviewers commented on the linearity of the playing and its departure from bebop . Without a drummer , the other musicians also recorded the first free improvisations by a group – " Intuition " and " Digression " . For these tracks , the sequence in which the musicians would join in the ensemble playing , and the approximate timing of those entrances , were planned , but nothing else – harmony , key , time signature , tempo , melody or rhythm – was prepared or set . Instead , the five musicians were held together by contrapuntal interaction . Both tracks were praised by critics , although their release was delayed – " Intuition " was released late in 1950 , and " Digression " not until 1954 . Parker and composer Aaron Copland were also impressed . Numerous other musicians of the time , however , thought Tristano 's music too progressive and emotionally cold , and predicted that it would not be popular with the public . 
 The sextet struggled to find enough work , but did play at Birdland 's opening night " A Journey Through Jazz " , a subsequent five @-@ week engagement at that club , and at various other venues in the north @-@ east of the US late in 1949 . They performed free pieces in these concerts , as well as Bach fugues , but found it difficult over time to continue to play with the freedom that they had initially felt . 
 = = = 1950s = = = 
 With occasional personnel changes , the sextet continued performing into 1951 . In the same year , the location for Tristano 's lessons shifted from his home in Flushing , Long Island to a Manhattan loft property , part of which he had converted into a recording studio . This also served as the location for frequent jam sessions with various invited musicians . The address became the title of one of his compositions – " 317 East 32nd Street " . At around the same time , Tristano started a record label named Jazz Records . It released " Ju @-@ ju " and " Pastime " on a 45 record in 1952 , before Tristano abandoned the project because of time demands and distribution problems . The two tracks were from a trio session with bassist Peter Ind and drummer Roy Haynes , and contained overdubbed second piano parts added later by Tristano . Ind described them as the first improvised , overdubbed recordings in jazz . Early reviewers largely failed to realize that overdubbing had been used . Tristano 's recording studio remained in use , and was the scene of early sessions for Debut Records , co @-@ founded by Roach and bassist Charles Mingus . 
 In 1952 Tristano 's band performed occasionally , including as a quintet in Canada . In the summer of that year , Konitz joined Stan Kenton 's band , breaking up the core of Tristano 's long @-@ standing quintet / sextet , although the saxophonist did on occasion play with Tristano again . 
 Tristano 's 1953 recording " Descent into the Maelstrom " was another innovation . It was a musical portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe 's story of the same title , and was an improvised solo piano piece that used multitracking and had no preconceived harmonic structure , being based instead on the development of motifs . Its atonality anticipated the much later work of pianists such as Cecil Taylor and Borah Bergman . 
 In the following year Tristano 's sextet played at the first Newport Jazz Festival . This may have been his only jazz festival appearance – he considered them to be too commercial . Marsh left the band in the summer of 1955 . 
 Tristano recorded his first album for Atlantic Records in 1955 ; he was allowed control over the recording process and what to release . The eponymous album included solo and trio tracks that contained further experiments with multitracking ( " Requiem " and " Turkish Mambo " ) and altered tape @-@ speed ( " Line Up " and " East 32nd " ) . The use of overdubbing and tape manipulation was controversial with some critics and musicians at the time . " Requiem " , a tribute to Parker , who had died a short time earlier , has a deep blues feeling – a style not usually associated with Tristano . For " Line Up " and " East 32nd " , Tristano 's " use of chromatic harmony [ ... ] secures him a position of a pioneer in expanding the harmonic vocabulary of jazz improvisation " , in biographer <unk> Shim 's words . 
 By the mid @-@ 1950s Tristano focused his energies more on music education . In 1956 he had to leave his Manhattan studio ; he established a new one in Hollis , Queens . Some of his core students moved to California after Tristano 's base was relocated . This , coupled with a separation from his wife in the same year due to his infidelity , meant that he was physically more isolated from the New York music scene . He gave fewer concerts than earlier , but in 1958 he had the first of what were sometimes lengthy engagements at New York 's Half Note Club , after the owners persuaded him to perform , in part by replacing their club 's Steinway piano with a new Bechstein of Tristano 's choosing . They later reported that , in the late 1950s and early 1960s , the musicians who were the most popular at their club were John Coltrane , Zoot Sims , and Tristano : " Coltrane brought in the masses , Zoot brought in the musicians and Lennie brought in the intellectuals . " In 1959 Tristano 's quintet again performed in Canada . 
 = = = 1960s and 1970s = = = 
 Tristano 's second album for Atlantic was recorded in 1961 and released the following year . The New Tristano , as was stressed on the album cover , consisted entirely of piano solos and no overdubbing or tape @-@ speed manipulation was employed . The tracks contain left @-@ hand bass lines that provide structure to each performance as well as counterpoint for the right @-@ hand playing ; block chords , unclear harmonies and contrasting rhythms also appear . Other solo piano recordings that Tristano made in 1961 were not released until the 1970s . 
 Tristano and his wife formally divorced in 1962 . Their son , Steve , who was born in 1952 , met his father only once after their initial 1956 separation . Tristano married again in the early 1960s . His second wife was Carol Miller , one of his students . They had a son , Bud , and two daughters , Tania and Carol . The couple divorced in 1964 , and Tristano later lost a custody battle with his ex @-@ wife over the children . 
 In 1964 the pianist reformed his quintet with Konitz and Marsh for a two @-@ month engagement at the Half Note and more performances in Canada . The quartet , missing Konitz , played in Toronto again in the following year . Tristano played on occasion at the Half Note Club until the mid @-@ 1960s , and toured Europe in 1965 . His European tour was mainly as a solo pianist , and the playing was in the style of his The New Tristano recordings . He performed with Ind and others in concerts in the UK in 1968 ; they were well received , and Tristano returned the following year . His last public performance in the US was in 1968 . 
 Tristano declined offers to perform in the 1970s ; he explained that he did not like to travel , and that the requirement for a career @-@ minded musician to play concerts was not something that he wanted to follow . He continued teaching , and helped to organize concerts for some of his students . Another album , Descent into the Maelstrom , was released in the 1970s ; it consisted of recordings made between 1951 and 1966 . 
 Tristano had a series of illnesses in the 1970s , including eye pain and emphysema ( he smoked for most of his life ) . On November 18 , 1978 he died of a heart attack at home in Jamaica , New York . 
 = = Personality and views on music = = 
 In Ind 's view , Tristano " was always so gentle , so charming and so quietly spoken that his directness could be unnerving . " This directness was noted by others , including bassist Chubby Jackson , who commented that Tristano had almost no tact and would not worry about being rude or making others feel incompetent . Some of his students described Tristano as domineering , but others indicated that this impression came from his demanding discipline in training and attitude to music . 
 Writer Barry Ulanov commented in 1946 that Tristano " was not content merely to feel something , [ ... ] he had to explore ideas , to experience them , to think them through carefully , thoroughly , logically until he could fully grasp them and then hold on to them . " Tristano criticized the free jazz that began in the 1960s for its lack of musical logic as well as its expression of negative emotions . " If you feel angry with somebody you hit him on the nose – not try to play angry music " , he commented ; " Express all that is positive . Beauty is a positive thing . " He expanded on this by distinguishing emotion from feeling , and suggested that playing a particular emotion was egotistical and lacking in feeling . 
 Tristano also complained about the commercialization of jazz and what he perceived to be the requirement to abandon the artistic part of playing in order to earn a living from performing . Later commentators have suggested that these complaints ignored the freedom that he was given by Atlantic and blamed others for what in many cases were the outcomes of his own career decisions . 
 = = Influences and playing style = = 
 <unk> Parker and Lester Young were important influences on Tristano 's development . Another major figure was pianist Art Tatum : Tristano practiced solo Tatum pieces early in his career , before gradually moving away from this influence in search of his own style . <unk> Bud Powell also affected Tristano 's playing and teaching , as he admired the younger pianist 's articulation and expression . 
 Tristano 's advanced grasp of harmony pushed his music beyond the complexities of the contemporary bebop movement : from his early recordings , he sought to develop the use of harmonies that were unusual for that period . His playing has been labeled " cool jazz " , but this fails to capture the range of his playing . Biographer <unk> Shim summarized the changes in Tristano 's playing during his career : 
 The trio recordings of 1946 show a novel approach in the linear interaction between piano and guitar , resulting in counterpoint , polyrhythm , and superimposed harmonies . The sextet recordings of 1949 are notable for coherent ensemble playing and soloing , and the free group improvisations based on spontaneous group interactions and the contrapuntal principle . In the 1950s Tristano employed an advanced concept in jazz improvisation called side @-@ slipping , or outside playing , which creates a form of temporary bitonality when chromatic harmony is superimposed over the standard harmonic progressions . Tristano intensified his use of counterpoint , polyrhythm , and chromaticism in the 1960s [ . ] 
 Grove Music commented on some aspects of Tristano 's style that were different from most modern jazz : " Rather than the irregular accents of bop , Tristano preferred an even rhythmic background against which to concentrate on line and focus his complex changes of time signature . Typically , his solos consisted of extraordinarily long , angular strings of almost even quavers provided with subtle rhythmic deviations and abrasive polytonal effects . He was particularly adept in his use of different levels of double time and was a master of the block @-@ chord style " .
