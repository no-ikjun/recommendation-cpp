 Fully recovered from his ailments , Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25 , 1948 . After a May 7 St. Louis Globe @-@ Democrat article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements , he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads . By June 24 , his batting average was .408 , prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial : " Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first . " Given a mid @-@ season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance , Musial hit a home run in the All @-@ Star Game . On September 22 , he registered five hits in a game for the fourth time in the season , tying a mark set by Ty Cobb in 1922 . 
 Musial finished 1948 leading the major leagues in batting average ( .376 ) , hits ( 230 ) , doubles ( 46 ) , triples ( 18 ) , total bases ( 429 ) , and slugging percentage ( <unk> ) . Winning the NL batting title by a 43 @-@ point margin , with an on @-@ base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138 @-@ point slugging percentage margin — the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby 's 1925 season — Musial became the first player to win three NL MVP awards . If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals , he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average , home runs , and runs batted in . 
 Anticipating life after his baseball career , Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius " Biggie " <unk> in January 1949 , opening " Stan Musial & Biggie 's " restaurant . He approached the 1949 season with the intent to try to hit more home runs , stating he had hit 39 the previous season " without trying " . His new focus on hitting for power backfired , as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman . Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May . He received his sixth consecutive All @-@ Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits ( 207 ) while playing in every game . However , the Cardinals , with 96 wins , finished one game behind the Dodgers . 
 In the late 1940s , when baseball was slowly becoming integrated , Musial — along with his roommate Red Schoendienst — would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers ' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance . " They never ... had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names " , Newcombe said , " because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place , a game for all people . "

 Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All @-@ Star Game , where in fan balloting he was the NL 's number two choice . He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season — a 30 @-@ game stretch that ended on July 27 . With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September , manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions . New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third @-@ place finish in 1951 , while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year . 
 National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began , after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine . Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players " who can be mentioned in the same breath with the <unk> greats " . Cobb went on to refer to Musial as " a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime . " In response , Musial displayed his characteristic modesty , saying , " Cobb is baseball 's greatest . I don 't want to contradict him , but I can 't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio . " 
 The only major league pitching appearance of Musial 's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season . Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank <unk> , the runner @-@ up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season . With <unk> batting right @-@ handed for the first time in his career , Musial 's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly <unk> and into the left field corner . The play was ruled an error , and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career . 
 The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953 , and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck @-@ hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team . Busch used the resources of the Anheuser @-@ Busch company to purchase the Cardinals , keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city . The 1953 season marked Musial 's 10th NL All @-@ Star selection , and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300 . 
 Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2 , 1954 , in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants : he hit three home runs in the first contest , then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader . In addition to his five home runs , he also hit a single in the first game , setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader . The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert , who achieved the feat in 1972 . 
 = = = = 1955 – 59 = = = = 
 Musial made his 12th NL All @-@ Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player , when Cincinnati 's Ted <unk> outpolled him by 150 @,@ 000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base . Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning , and played left field as the game entered extra innings . Leading off the bottom of the 12th , he hit a home run to give the NL a 6 – 5 victory . 
 The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial , when he broke Mel Ott 's NL record for extra @-@ base hits on August 12 . Earlier that season , Cardinals general manager " Trader Frank " Lane began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts . When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move , he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade . Instead , Lane dealt Musial 's close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants ; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press . 
 On June 11 , 1957 , Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his <unk> , a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season . Despite ballot stuffing by Cincinnati Reds fans , he was selected and played in the All @-@ Star Game held at Sportsman 's Park . When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23 , Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone . He was unable to play again until September 8 , ending his consecutive games @-@ played streak at 895 . He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrated 's " Sportsman of the Year " . 
 Musial signed one of the first $ 100 @,@ 000 contracts in NL history on January 29 , 1958 . ( According to Baseball Almanac , Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947 . ) He quickly demonstrated a return on the investment by sharing with Willie Mays the inaugural ( and for the only time in Musial 's career ) NL Player of the Month in May ( no such award was given in April until 1969 ) batting .374 , with 4 HR , and 16 RBI . Also that month , as he was approaching the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ hit milestone in his major league career , he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis . He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch @-@ hit , sixth inning RBI double at Chicago 's Wrigley Field on May 13 . The eighth major league player to reach 3 @,@ 000 hits , and the first to reach the milestone with an extra @-@ base hit , Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1 @,@ 000 fans . Finishing the season in sixth place , the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan , winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the Central and Pacific Japanese Leagues . 
 Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season , Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year . Musial , at 6 feet ( 180 cm ) tall , had maintained a weight of around 175 pounds ( 79 kg ) throughout his career . He reported to spring training approximately 10 pounds ( 4 @.@ 5 kg ) overweight and in substandard physical condition . He began the season with one hit in 15 at @-@ bats . Despite his early offensive struggles , he single @-@ handedly spoiled potential no @-@ hitters on April 16 and 19 . A game @-@ winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3 @,@ 000 hits . As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace , his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly <unk> at various points during the season . Seeking more revenue for the players ' pension fund , Major League Baseball held two All @-@ Star games in a season for the first time through 1962 . Musial made his 16th All @-@ Star appearance ( 16th season ) and pinch @-@ hit in both contests , flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game . He finished the season with 115 regular game appearances , a .255 batting average , 37 runs , and a slugging percentage of .428 . 
 During the 1959 season , John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy 's campaign for President , citing their close ages . Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democrat . 
 On June 30 , 1959 , Musial was the batter in one of baseball history 's oddest plays . In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs , he was at the plate with a count of 3 – 1 . Bob Anderson 's next pitch was errant , evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop . Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four , even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball . Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher , Musial kept running in attempt to make second base . Seeing that Musial was trying for second , Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball . The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper , but Dark ended up getting it back anyway . <unk> , however , Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor . Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second , took the new ball , and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor . Anderson 's throw flew over Taylor 's head into the outfield . Dark , at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball , threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks . Musial did not see Dark 's throw and only noticed Anderson 's ball fly over the second baseman 's head , so he tried to go to third base . On his way there , he was tagged by Banks , and after a delay he was ruled out .

 Based on his 1959 performance , Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $ 100 @,@ 000 salary to $ 80 @,@ 000 . Eager to prove his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning , he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt , Saint Louis University 's director of physical education . In June 1960 , newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire , yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average . He addressed the speculation in September , confirming that he would play again in 1961 . His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision . In 1962 , Musial posted a .330 batting average , good for third in the batting race , with 19 homers and 82 RBI . As a pinch @-@ hitter , he had 14 base hits in 19 at @-@ bats ( <unk> ) . Along the way , he established new NL career marks for hits , RBI , and runs scored . That same year , on July 8 , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game . 
 The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games , as Musial posted a .237 batting average . He set a new major league record for career extra @-@ base hits on May 8 and improved his batting average to .277 by the end of the month . Making his 20th All @-@ Star appearance and 24th All @-@ Star Game appearance on July 9 , 1963 , he pinch @-@ hit in the fifth inning . Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were , Musial decided to retire at season 's end . He waited until the Cardinals team picnic on August 12 to publicly announce his decision , hopeful he could retire on a winning note . 
 Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 10 ; later that day , he hit a home run in his first at @-@ bat . After sweeping a doubleheader on September 15 , the Cardinals had won 19 of their last 20 games , and were one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers . The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three @-@ game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25 . Musial 's last game , on September 29 , 1963 , was preceded by an hour @-@ long retirement ceremony . Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick , Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray , and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch , who announced that Musial 's uniform number " 6 " would be retired by the team . During the game , Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning , then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth . Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch @-@ runner for Musial , bringing his major league career to an end . Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut , Musial finished his last game with two hits , as well . Musial finished with the all @-@ time National League record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all @-@ time Major League list . Musial 's last hit in his career was hit past the Cincinnati Reds second baseman at the time , Pete Rose , who later broke Cobb 's record to become the all @-@ time hit king . 
 At the time of his retirement , Musial held or shared 17 major league records , 29 NL records , and nine All @-@ Star Game records . Among those records , he ranked as the major league career leader in extra @-@ base hits ( 1 @,@ 377 ) and total bases ( 6 @,@ 134 ) . He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits ( 3 @,@ 630 ) , games played ( 3 @,@ 026 ) , doubles ( 725 ) , and RBI ( 1 @,@ 951 ) . He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category . Jerry <unk> speculates Musial would likely have become the second player , after Babe Ruth , with 2 @,@ 000 RBI , and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military . His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 ( in 1942 ) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2 @,@ 000 for his full career , he certainly would have exceeded 2 @,@ 000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945 . His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500 . He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 ( the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member ) until 1948 , 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II . His career hit total was evenly split between 1 @,@ 815 hits at home and 1 @,@ 815 hits on the road . Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb 's career hit record of 4 @,@ 191 . Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times ( the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy ) in 1945 , he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty . His hit total in his last season at age 43 was only 86 ; even if he could have had 103 hits a season ( the average of his last 5 seasons ) he would have had to play to age 47 to attain the hits record . 
 He was the first major league player to appear in more than 1 @,@ 000 games at two different positions , registering 1 @,@ 896 games in the outfield and 1 @,@ 016 at first base . Since Musial 's retirement in 1963 , the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average has been Tony Gwynn . Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6 @,@ 134 total bases . 
 In Musial 's 3 @,@ 026 major league appearances , he was never ejected from a game . Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport 's history , sportscaster Bob Costas said , " He didn 't hit a homer in his last at @-@ bat ; he hit a single . He didn 't hit in 56 straight games . He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her . ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being . " 
 = = Post @-@ playing career and family life = = 
 Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963 , and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season . From February 1964 to January 1967 , he also served as President Lyndon Johnson 's physical fitness adviser , a part @-@ time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens . Before the 1967 season began , the Cardinals named Musial the team 's general manager , and he oversaw the club 's World Series championship that year . He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player @-@ contract negotiations and creating an in @-@ stadium babysitting service so players ' wives could attend games . His longtime business partner Biggie <unk> died in June 1967 , prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests . He came to realize that the detail @-@ oriented desk job was not his forte . He consequently decided to step down as general manager , before even completing a full year on the job . 
 Musial was noted for his harmonica playing , including his rendition of " Take Me Out to the Ball Game " . Through the 1990s , he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings , such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events . He performed on the television show Hee Haw and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica @-@ playing instruction booklet . 
 Even though Musial left Donora after high school , he retained close ties to the town throughout the rest of his life . He maintained membership in local social clubs , and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs , with the town 's mayor using some for United Way fundraising . Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents . 
 Musial met Lillian Susan <unk> , the daughter of a local grocer , in Donora when both were 15 , and married her in St. Paul 's Catholic Church in Daytona Beach , Florida on May 25 , 1940 . They had four children : son Richard , and daughters Gerry , Janet , and Jeanie . Lillian Musial died at 91 , on May 3 , 2012 ; their marriage had lasted for almost 72 years . In his final years , Musial suffered from Alzheimer 's disease .

 On August 4 , 1968 , a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium . The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006 , where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans . Musial 's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick : " Here stands baseball 's perfect warrior . Here stands baseball 's perfect knight . " 
 Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1969 , named on 93 @.@ 2 percent of the ballots . On June 14 , 1973 he was the first inductee into the National Polish @-@ American Hall of Fame , housed at St. Mary 's College in Orchard Lake , Michigan . In 1989 , he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame . Five years later , a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora . He was ranked tenth on The Sporting News ' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998 . He was also one of the 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All @-@ Century Team , added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders . In 2000 , he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians , and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol . In January , 2014 , the Cardinals announced Musial among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014 . 
 Nearly two decades after Musial retired , baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history . In 2001 , James ranked Musial the tenth @-@ greatest baseball player in history , and the second @-@ best left fielder of all time . According to Baseball @-@ Reference.com , he ranks fifth all @-@ time among hitters on the Black Ink Test , and third all @-@ time on the Gray Ink Test — measures designed to compare players of different eras . He ranks first on Baseball @-@ Reference 's Hall of Fame Monitor Test , and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test . Despite his statistical accomplishments , he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history . For instance , in his analysis of baseball 's under- and overrated players in 2007 , sportswriter Jayson Stark said , " I can 't think of any all @-@ time great in any sport who gets left out of more who 's @-@ the @-@ greatest conversations than Stan Musial . " 
 Musial threw out the first pitch in the fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game . A " Stan the Man " day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18 , 2008 . In 2010 , another one of the Cardinals ' greatest sluggers , Albert Pujols , whose nickname was " El Hombre " , said he didn 't want to be called " The Man " , even in Spanish , because " There is one man that gets that respect , and that is Stan Musial . " Also in 2010 , the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service . The campaign realized its goal , and on February 15 , 2011 , Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama who called him " an icon untarnished , a beloved pillar of the community , a gentleman you 'd want your kids to emulate . " 
 On October 17 , 2012 , Musial made his final appearance at Busch Stadium , riding in a golf cart around the warning track before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series . Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny . The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8 @-@ 3 , but lost the pennant to the eventual World Series champion Giants .

 Musial died at age 92 of natural causes on January 19 , 2013 , at his home in Ladue , Missouri , on the same day as fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver . Musial was surrounded by his family as he died peacefully . Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt , Jr. released the following statement : 
 We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family . Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball . The entire Cardinals organization extends its sincere condolences to Stan 's family , including his children Richard , Gerry , Janet and Jean , as well as his eleven grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren . We join fans everywhere in mourning the loss of our dear friend and reflect on how fortunate we all are to have known ' Stan the Man ' . 
 Upon hearing the news of his death , fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial by his statue outside Busch Stadium ; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time . In a laudatory obituary , The New York Times quoted famed New York manager Leo Durocher : " There is only one way to pitch to Musial — under the plate . " 
 Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented : " Stan Musial was a great American hero who — with the utmost humility — inspired us all to aim high and dream big . The world is emptier today without him , but far better to have known him . The legacy of ' baseball 's perfect warrior ' will endure and inspire generations to come . " 
 St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted : " Sad as we are , we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long , and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again . " He ordered flags at half @-@ mast in the city . 
 " Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial , a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life " , Commissioner Bud Selig said . " He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations , and he served his country during World War II . A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 , Stan 's life embodies baseball 's unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime . " 
 Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis , where Musial lay in state , dressed in his trademark cardinal @-@ red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket , flanked by a Navy honor guard . A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday , January 26 , 2013 , at the New Cathedral in St. Louis , televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay @-@ television . New York 's Cardinal Timothy Dolan , who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis , was the principal celebrant , and Knoxville 's Bishop Richard F. <unk> , Musial 's former parish priest , was the homilist . Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy , calling him " the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed , and disillusionment came from other directions , never once let us down " , and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle , who once said that Musial " was a better player than me because he was a better man than me " . Following the funeral , Musial 's family led a procession from the New Cathedral to Busch Stadium , where they laid a memorial wreath at his statue . Once the wreath was placed and Musial 's family began to walk back to their vehicles , the hundreds of Cardinal fans gathered for the wreath ceremony gave both Musial and his family one final salute . That salute was the fans singing " Take Me Out to the Ball Game " before Musial was taken to his final place of rest . 
 Musial was the last living member of the Cardinals team that won the 1942 World Series . At the time of his death , no living players had played on an earlier World Series @-@ winning team .

 As a reflection of his popularity Musial has had infrastructure named after him . In May 2011 the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance <unk> Memorial Highway ( S.R. 1077 ) over the Monongahela River from Donora @-@ <unk> Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial who was a native of the area . In October 2013 the St. Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial . In July 2013 , the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River between Illinois and Missouri at St. Louis received the official name of " Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge " 
 = Lazarus ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Lazarus " is the fifteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on February 4 , 1994 . It was written by Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon , directed by David Nutter , and featured guest appearances by Cec <unk> and Christopher Allport . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Lazarus " earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 6 , being watched by 7 @.@ 2 million households in its initial broadcast ; and received mixed reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . After an old partner of Scully 's is wounded in a bank robbery , Scully and Mulder come to believe that the injured man has been possessed by the spirit of the dead bank robber . 
 In the episode 's original plot , the bank robber was to have jumped into Mulder 's body . There was , however , a belief at the time that neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena . After Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such a way , the producers agreed to make the change . The opening bank robbery scene was filmed on location in Vancouver , where Jason <unk> 's acting led some bystanders to believe that robbery was a real one . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Dana Scully assists a fellow FBI agent , Jack Willis , in apprehending violent bank robbers Warren Dupre and Lula Phillips . Following an anonymous tip , the two agents corner Dupre during an attempted robbery . Dupre shoots Willis with a shotgun , but is himself shot by Scully . Dupre dies , but Willis is eventually revived ; however , Dupre 's corpse is seen reacting to the jolts from the <unk> used on Willis . 
 Willis wakes up a few days later , but now has a more sinister personality . He finds Dupre 's body and cuts off his fingers to retrieve a wedding ring before fleeing the hospital . Scully explains to Fox Mulder that Willis has been obsessed with the Dupre @-@ Phillips case for the past year , and admits to dating Willis while he was her instructor at the FBI Academy . It is discovered that left @-@ handed shears were used to cut off Dupre 's fingers , despite the fact that Willis is right @-@ handed , leading Mulder to believe that Willis ' body is inhabited by Dupre 's consciousness . The agents visit a University of Maryland medical professor who theorizes that during near @-@ death experiences , an energy release can occur that could radically change someone 's personality . 
 Willis , who finds Dupre 's tattoo appearing on his arm , confronts Lula 's brother Tommy and kills him , believing that he sold him out to the FBI and caused his " death " . When Mulder and Scully investigate the next day , Willis arrives . He passes the tests that Scully gives him , but when Mulder asks him to sign a fake birthday card for Scully — whose birthday is months away — he signs it . Scully is skeptical of Mulder 's claims that Dupre is in Willis 's body , believing that he is under stress due to his near @-@ death experience . 
 When a landlord calls the FBI to tip them off about Phillips ' location , Scully and Willis move in to capture her . However , when Scully corners Phillips , Willis holds Scully at gunpoint and forces her to instead handcuff herself . Scully is taken to Phillips ' house , where she is beaten and handcuffed to a radiator . Willis then successfully convinces Lula that he is actually Dupre . Willis calls Mulder to tell him that he and Phillips are holding Scully hostage , leaving Mulder frustrated and angry . 
 After seeing Willis / Dupre consume a large quantity of soda , Scully reveals that Willis is a diabetic and will require insulin to survive . Phillips and Willis / Dupre rob a pharmacy to obtain the necessary insulin . However , Phillips refuses to let Willis use it , revealing that it was she who betrayed him , having fled the scene the night of the botched bank robbery . Phillips calls Mulder , demanding a $ 1 million ransom for Scully . By using audio of a plane nearby , Mulder and his task force are able to track their general location , and a disguised cop going door to door spots Phillips . 
 Willis / Dupre feigns death , and when Phillips drops her wedding ring on him , he grabs her gun and kills her . He dies seconds later due to the lack of insulin . Mulder , who has just arrived on the scene , releases Scully . Later Scully retrieves Willis ' possessions from the morgue , including a watch she gave him for his thirty @-@ fifth birthday .

 In the episode 's original plot , Dupre was to have jumped into Mulder 's body . There was , however , a belief at the time that neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena ; Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such a way . With more than a little reluctance , the producers agreed to make the change . As writer Howard Gordon later recalled , " We 'd wanted Mulder to experience the soul switch " . Eventually , however , Fox 's stance was changed ; most notably , in the two @-@ part sixth season episode , " Dreamland " , when Mulder 's consciousness is exchanged with government agent Morris Fletcher . Gordon ultimately came to believe that the final decision was almost certainly for the best and saw the benefit of introducing Scully 's former boyfriend as it provided a welcome opportunity to delve into her history . 
 The opening bank robbery scene was filmed on location in Vancouver , where Jason <unk> 's acting led some bystanders to believe that robbery was a real one . Interior shots set in Dupre 's basement were filmed in an asbestos @-@ lined apartment building , where a translator was required to interface with the mostly @-@ Asian tenants . This episode features the first of several occasions in which Scully is abducted . Her birthday , February 23 , is revealed for the first time in this episode ; though the year of her birth , 1964 , would not be established until the second season episode " One Breath " .

 " Lazarus " premiered on the Fox network on February 4 , 1994 , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on January 5 , 1995 . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 6 , with a 12 share and was viewed by 7 @.@ 2 million households , meaning that roughly 7 @.@ 2 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 12 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . 
 Series creator Chris Carter was very pleased with the episode , stating that it was " a very good and well @-@ acted episode . I like it because it actually seemed too real to me . It played less as a paranormal science fiction show than as whether or not something could really happen . The entire cast was wonderful . Overall that was a terrific episode " . In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly , " Lazarus " was rated a C + , being described as " as exciting as Scully 's taste in men ( not very ) " . The episode 's supporting cast , however , was described as " solid " . Zack Handlen , writing for The A.V. Club , rated episode a B- , finding that it had " no real thematic resonance " . He found that the episode left its premise " largely unexplored " , and would have benefited from a stronger focus on the relationship between the characters of Willis and Dupre . Matt Haigh , writing for Den of Geek , reviewed the episode negatively , feeling that it " wasn 't up to much " , and that it " plays more like an episode of Diagnosis Murder than anything else " . However , the exploration of Scully 's character history was cited as a positive aspect of the episode . Anna Johns , writing for TV Squad , was critical of " Lazarus " , stating that its opening scene was " the only good part " of the episode .

 Pennsylvania Route 179 ( PA 179 ) and Route 179 is an 8 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 14 @.@ 00 km ) state highway in Bucks County , Pennsylvania and Hunterdon County , New Jersey , United States , running along an old alignment of U.S. Route 202 ( US 202 ) from west of New Hope , Pennsylvania northeast through Lambertville , New Jersey to Ringoes , where it ends at an intersection with US 202 and Route 31 . Past this intersection , the road continues east as County Route 514 ( CR 514 ) . It is two @-@ lane , undivided highway for most of its length with the exception of a four @-@ lane stretch in Lambertville . The route crosses the Delaware River on the New Hope @-@ Lambertville Bridge , where the designation changes from PA 179 to Route 179 . 
 PA 179 and Route 179 follow a part of the 18th @-@ century Old York Road which ran between Philadelphia and New York City . Prior to 1953 , the road was Route S29 from the Delaware River to downtown Lambertville , a part of Route 29 between Lambertville and Ringoes , and a concurrency of Route 29 and Route 30 in Ringoes . The route was also part of US 202 , which was designated over 1926 @-@ created US 122 in the mid @-@ 1930s . In 1953 , the Route S29 and 29 designations were removed in favor of US 202 and Route 30 became Route 69 ( now Route 31 ) . Route 179 was formed in 1965 when a bypass for Ringoes was built for US 202 and Route 69 . Route 179 extended to Lambertville and PA 179 was created in 1974 when the new US 202 freeway , running over the New Hope @-@ Lambertville Toll Bridge , was completed .

 At the middle of the New Hope @-@ Lambertville Bridge , the road enters Lambertville , Hunterdon County , New Jersey and becomes Route 179 . It heads east through Lambertville on Bridge Street through the downtown area . At the intersection with Main Street , Route 29 joins Route 179 for a block , forming a wrong @-@ way concurrency At the end of the concurrency , Route 29 turns south onto Route 165 and Route 179 turns north . From here the road continues northeast as the four @-@ lane , undivided Thomas Paine Highway , entering West Amwell Township , where the road heads into farmland and narrows to two lanes . In East Amwell Township , the route intersects CR 603 , CR 601 , and CR 605 ( Queen Road ) , which heads to an interchange with the US 202 freeway . 
 The road eventually forms the border between West Amwell and East Amwell Township . Route 179 intersects the US 202 freeway at a partial cloverleaf interchange , where the route is entirely in East Amwell Township . Past this interchange , the route runs along the West Amwell / East Amwell township line until it entirely enters East Amwell Township again and heads into the residential community of Ringoes . In Ringoes , Route 179 intersects the old Route 31 ( now CR 579 ) , forming a brief concurrency that lasts with that route until CR 579 heads north on John Ringo Road . Route 179 continues northeast through residential areas on Old York Road to its terminus at the combined US 202 / Route 31 , where Old York Road continues to the northeast as CR 514 .

 The current alignment of PA 179 and Route 179 was a part of Old York Road , a historical 18th @-@ century road that connected Philadelphia to New York City . With the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , the route was designated as a part of US 122 , which became US 202 in the mid @-@ 1930s . In Pennsylvania , the route was initially cosigned with PA 52 ; that designation was removed by 1930 . Prior to the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , today 's Route 179 was composed of three state routes : Route S29 , designated in 1949 from the New Hope @-@ Lambertville Bridge into Lambertville , a part of Route 29 from Lambertville to Ringoes that was designated in 1927 , and a concurrency of Routes 29 and 30 northeast from Ringoes that was also designated in 1927 . In the original 1927 plan , Route 29 would have continued northeast from the end of Route 179 along current CR 514 , but it was instead modified to continue north with Route 30 to Flemington and using what had been planned as Route 12 to Somerville . 
 In the 1953 renumbering , the Route S29 and Route 29 designations were removed from the route in favor of US 202 , with Route 29 was realigned to follow former Route 29A to Frenchtown . In addition , Route 30 became Route 69 ( now Route 31 ) to avoid conflicting with US 30 in South Jersey . The bypass of Ringoes for US 202 and Route 69 was opened in the 1960s , and Route 179 was designated along the old alignment of US 202 within Ringoes . The new US 202 freeway between the New Hope @-@ Lambertville Toll Bridge and Route 179 southwest of Ringoes was completed in October 1974 . As a result , Route 179 was extended along the old US 202 alignment to the state line in Lambertville and PA 179 was designated along the former US 202 through New Hope . Solebury Township is pushing for a roundabout at the intersection of US 202 and PA 179 .

 St. Anger is the eighth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica , released on June 5 , 2003 by Elektra Records . It was the band 's last album released through Elektra , thus marking the end of the second @-@ longest timespan between studio albums from Metallica , with nearly six years between the release of Reload and this album . It is also the final collaboration between Metallica and producer Bob Rock , whose relationship began with the band 's fifth studio album , 1991 's Metallica . St. Anger was originally intended for release on June 10 , 2003 , but was released five days earlier due to concerns over unlicensed distribution through peer @-@ to @-@ peer file sharing networks . The St. Anger sessions also mark the only time Rock actually played when the music was being recorded , filling in for the departed bassist Jason Newsted . 
 Newsted left the band prior to the initial sessions for the album , leaving Rock to temporarily take his place until a permanent replacement could be found . Recording of the album initially started on April 23 , 2001 , but was postponed indefinitely when rhythm guitarist and singer James Hetfield entered rehab for " alcoholism and other addictions " . St. Anger is often recognized for being a radical musical departure from Metallica 's earlier work ; it features a modern heavy metal style , raw production , and no guitar solos . The artwork was created by Pushead , who had previously collaborated with the band . 
 Metallica spent the next couple of years touring to promote the album . St. Anger debuted at the top of sales charts in 30 countries , including the US Billboard 200 . Upon its release , it received mixed reviews . In 2004 , the album 's lead single , " St. Anger " , won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance . The album was certified 2 × platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipping two million copies in the US . St. Anger has sold nearly six million copies worldwide .

 Metallica rented an old Army barracks on the Presidio of San Francisco , California and converted it into a makeshift studio in January 2001 . As plans were being made to enter the studio to write and record its first album in nearly five years , Metallica postponed the recording due to the departure of bassist Jason Newsted . Newsted left Metallica on January 17 , 2001 , stating his departure was due to " private and personal reasons and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love " . Uncomfortable with immediately writing and recording with a new bassist , Metallica opted to include Bob Rock as bassist . The band stated they would find another bass player upon the album 's completion . 
 In July 2001 , recording came to a halt when James Hetfield entered rehab for alcoholism and other undisclosed addictions . Hetfield returned to the band in April of the next year , but was only allowed to work on the album from 12 : 00 to 4 : 00 PM . Due to his personal dilemmas , as well as Metallica 's internal struggles , the band hired a personal enhancement coach , Phil Towle , to help them . This and the recording of the album was documented by filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky . Throughout two years of filming , over 1 @,@ 000 hours of video were recorded , documenting the band 's recording process . Subsequent to the album 's release , Berlinger and Sinofsky released the edited material as the film Some Kind of Monster . 
 Hetfield stated that the album was written with " a lot of passion " . He said , " There 's two years of condensed emotion in this . We 've gone through a lot of personal changes , struggles , epiphanies , it 's deep . It 's so deep lyrically and musically . [ St. Anger ] is just the best that it can be from us right now . " The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album ; therefore Rock did not polish the sound while mixing . The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt and did not want to " mess with it " . Rock commented , " I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds . To me , this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs . There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James . We liked the raw performances . And we didn 't do what everyone does and what I 've been guilty of for a long time , which is tuning vocals . We just did it , boom , and that was it . " 
 Guitarist Kirk Hammett commented on the lack of guitar solos on St. Anger , a departure from what Metallica has done in the past : " We wanted to preserve the sound of all four of us in a room just jamming . We tried to put guitar solos on , but we kept on running into this problem . It really sounded like an afterthought . " Hammett said that he was happy with the final product . Rock stated , " We made a promise to ourselves that we 'd only keep stuff that had integrity . We didn 't want to make a theatrical statement by adding overdubs . " 
 Drummer Lars Ulrich achieved a unique sound on St. Anger by turning off the snares on his snare drum resulting in a drum tone with far more " ring " than is usual in rock and metal . This sound received much backlash from fans and critics alike . Ulrich said , " One day I forgot to turn the snare on because I wasn 't thinking about this stuff . At the playbacks , I decided I was really liking what I was hearing — it had a different ambience . It sang back to me in a beautiful way . " Regarding the backlash about the sound , he stated , " It 's crazy , that kind of closed @-@ mindedness . " Rock said , " I would say I 've only [ done something ] this brutal [ sounding ] when I 've done demos . It probably sounds heavier because it 's Metallica , but really this was a 15 @-@ minutes @-@ on @-@ the @-@ drum @-@ sound type of thing . " 
 When St. Anger was completed , Metallica kept true to its earlier statement and hired a new permanent bassist . In February 2003 , Robert Trujillo joined the band . Trujillo appeared on the footage of studio rehearsals of St. Anger in its entirety , which was included on DVD in the album package .

 Brian " Pushead " Schroeder designed the album cover and interior artwork for St. Anger . Pushead has designed a number of items for Metallica in the past , including liner artwork of ... And Justice for All , several single covers , and many T @-@ shirts ; however , the album marks his first studio album cover art for the band . Originally , according to Metallica 's official website , four different limited color variations of the cover were planned , but the idea was eventually scrapped .

 St. Anger was released on June 5 , 2003 . It was originally scheduled for June 10 , but due to Metallica 's previous battle with Napster and fear that it would be illegally released onto peer @-@ to @-@ peer file sharing networks , the band pushed the release date five days ahead . A special edition of the album was released with a bonus DVD , featuring live , in @-@ the @-@ studio rehearsals of all of the St. Anger tracks . First week sales of the album were 417 @,@ 000 copies , and it debuted at # 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 , as well as 30 other countries in the world . In 2004 , Metallica won the award for Best Metal Performance , for the title track . 
 After St. Anger 's release , Metallica embarked on a tour that would last nearly two years . The first leg was the U.S. 2003 Summer Sanitarium tour with support from Limp Bizkit , Deftones , Linkin Park , and Mudvayne . After Summer Sanitarium , the band began the Madly in Anger with the World Tour with support from Godsmack ( and Slipknot on certain European dates ) , which lasted until late 2004 . The St. Anger songs " Frantic " , " St. Anger " , " Dirty Window " and " The Unnamed Feeling " were performed frequently during the tour . " Sweet Amber " and " Some Kind of Monster " were also played live , but not as often as other songs on the album . The album tracks were altered when played live ; sometimes they were shortened , or in some cases a guitar solo was added . Sometimes , only one song from the album was played live . By 2009 , the songs from St. Anger were completely absent from Metallica 's set lists . The last time any song was performed from the album on a major tour was " Frantic " on October 21 , 2008 in Glendale , Arizona , although " Dirty Window " and " Frantic " were performed again on December 10 , 2011 during the last concert of Metallica 's special and private 30th Anniversary Tour , in San Francisco , California . " St. Anger " was also played again during the " Metallica by Request " tour in 2014 when it was voted by the fans . In October 2007 , " All Within My Hands " was performed live for the first time , acoustically , at both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concerts . 
 Metallica also released four singles from St. Anger . The order of the releases was " St. Anger " , " Frantic " , " The Unnamed Feeling " and " Some Kind of Monster " . On the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart , these singles charted at # 2 , # 21 , # 28 and # 18 , respectively . Promotional music videos were also made of all four of the songs . These videos can be found on Metallica 's DVD video collection , titled The Videos 1989 @-@ 2004 , and the video for " Some Kind of Monster " can also be found on the film Some Kind of Monster . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 St. Anger received mixed to positive reviews from critics ; the album holds a score of 65 out of 100 , based on 20 reviews , on review @-@ aggregating website Metacritic . Adrien Begrand of PopMatters took both sides , saying : " While it 's an ungodly mess at times , what you hear on this album is a band playing with passion for the first time in years . " Producer Bob Rock said that it was intended to sound like " a band jamming together in a garage for the first time , and the band just happened to be Metallica " . Talking about the album , Greg Kot from Blender said , " It may be too late to rehabilitate Metallica 's image , but once again , their music is all about bringing the carnage . " Writing for NME , Ian Watson said that " the songs are a stripped back , heroically brutal reflection of this fury . You get the sense that , as with their emotional selves , they 've taken metal apart and started again from scratch . There 's no space wasted here , no time for petty guitar solos or downtuned bass trickery , just a focused , relentless attack . " Johnny Loftus of AllMusic praised the album and described it as a " punishing , unflinching document of internal struggle — taking listeners inside the bruised yet vital body of Metallica , but ultimately revealing the alternately torturous and defiant demons that wrestle inside Hetfield 's brain . St. Anger is an immediate record . " Barry Walter from Rolling Stone magazine also had a positive reaction to the direction taken in " St. Anger " , stating " No wonder there 's an authenticity to St. Anger 's fury that none of the band 's rap @-@ metal followers can touch . " He also went further to note the lack of commercial influence and modern rock aspects of previous albums , continuing ; " There 's no radio @-@ size , four @-@ minute rock here , no pop @-@ friendly choruses , no ballads , no solos , no wayward experimentation . " 
 Although many reviews were positive toward St. Anger , some reviewers had a strong distaste for the album . Brent DiCrescenzo from Pitchfork Media strongly disliked the album and criticized Ulrich and Hammett , saying that Ulrich was " playing a drum set consisting of steel drums , aluminum toms , programmed double kicks , and a broken church bell . The kit 's high @-@ end clamor ignored the basic principles of drumming : timekeeping , " he added , " Hetfield and Hammett 's guitars underwent more processing than cat food . When they both <unk> through ' St. Anger ' , and most other movements , [ Hetfield and Hammett ] seemed to overwhelm each other with different , terrible noise . Also the duration of most songs made it boring to hear them . " PopMatters reporter Michael Christopher said " St. Anger dispenses with the recent spate of radio friendly pleasantries in favor of pedal to the floor thrash , staggered and extended song structures , quick changes and a muddled production that tries to harken back to the Kill ' Em All days .

 = French battleship Diderot = 
 Diderot was one of the six Danton class semi @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy in the early 1900s . Shortly after World War I began , the ship participated in the Battle of Antivari in the Adriatic Sea and helped to sink an Austro @-@ Hungarian protected cruiser . She spent most of the rest of the war blockading the Straits of Otranto and the Dardanelles to prevent German , Austro @-@ Hungarian and Turkish warships from breaking out into the Mediterranean . Diderot briefly participated in the occupation of Constantinople after the end of the war . She was modernized in 1922 – 25 and subsequently became a training ship . The ship was condemned in 1936 and later sold for scrap . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Although the Danton @-@ class battleships were a significant improvement from the preceding Liberté class , they were outclassed by the advent of the dreadnought well before they were completed . This , combined with other poor traits , including the great weight in coal they had to carry , made them rather unsuccessful ships , though their numerous rapid @-@ firing guns were of some use in the Mediterranean . 
 Diderot was 146 @.@ 6 meters ( 481 ft 0 in ) long overall and had a beam of 25 @.@ 8 meters ( 84 ft 8 in ) and a full @-@ load draft of 9 @.@ 2 meters ( 30 ft 2 in ) . She displaced 19 @,@ 736 metric tons ( 19 @,@ 424 long tons ) at deep load and had a crew of 681 officers and enlisted men . The ship was powered by four Parsons steam turbines using steam generated by twenty @-@ six Belleville boilers . The turbines were rated at 22 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 16 @,@ 800 kW ) and provided a top speed of around 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . Diderot , however , reached a top speed of 19 @.@ 9 knots ( 36 @.@ 9 km / h ; 22 @.@ 9 mph ) on her sea trials . She carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 027 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 995 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 3 @,@ 370 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 240 km ; 3 @,@ 880 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Diderot 's main battery consisted of four 305mm / 45 Modèle 1906 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets , one forward and one aft . The secondary battery consisted of twelve 240mm / 50 Modèle 1902 guns in twin turrets , three on each side of the ship . A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats . These included sixteen 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) L / 65 guns and ten 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns . The ship was also armed with two submerged 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . The ship 's waterline armor belt was 270 mm ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) thick and the main battery was protected by up to 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) of armor . The conning tower also had 300 mm thick sides . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 During the war 75 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns were installed on the roofs of the ship 's two forward 240 mm gun turrets . During 1918 , the elevation of the 240 mm guns was increased which extended their range to 18 @,@ 000 meters ( 20 @,@ 000 yd ) .

 Construction of Diderot began on 26 December 1906 by Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire in Saint @-@ Nazaire and the ship was laid down on 20 October 1907 . She was launched on 19 April 1909 and was completed on 1 August 1911 . The ship was assigned to the First Division of the First Squadron ( escadre ) of the Mediterranean Fleet when she was commissioned . The ship participated in combined fleet maneuvers between Provence and Tunisia in May – June 1913 and the subsequent naval review conducted by the President of France , Raymond Poincaré on 7 June 1913 . Afterwards , Diderot joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October – December 1913 and participated in the grand fleet exercise in the Mediterranean in May 1914 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 In early August 1914 , the ship cruised the Strait of Sicily in an attempt to prevent the German battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau from breaking out to the West . On 16 August 1914 the combined Anglo @-@ French Fleet under Admiral Auguste Boué de Lapeyrère , including Voltaire , made a sweep of the Adriatic Sea . The Allied ships encountered the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser SMS Zenta , escorted by the destroyer SMS Ulan , blockading the coast of Montenegro . There were too many ships for Zenta to escape , so she remained behind to allow Ulan to get away and was sunk by gunfire during the Battle of Antivari off the coast of Bar , Montenegro . Voltaire subsequently participated in a number of raids into the Adriatic later in the year and patrolled the Ionian Islands . From December 1914 through 1917 , the ship participated in the distant blockade of the Straits of Otranto while based in Corfu . In May 1918 , Diderot became flagship of the First Division of the Second Squadron and was transferred that month to Mudros with her sister ships , Mirabeau and Vergniaud , to prevent Goeben from breaking out into the Mediterranean and remained there until the end of the war . 
 = = = Postwar = = = 
 After the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire , the ship participated in the early stage of the occupation of Constantinople from 12 November to 12 December . Diderot was based in Toulon throughout 1919 and was modernized in 1922 – 25 to improve her underwater protection . The ship became a training ship in 1927 and was condemned in on 17 March 1937 ; sold to M.

 = James W. Stephenson = 
 James W. Stephenson ( 1806 – August 1838 ) was an American militia officer and politician from the state of Illinois . He was born in Virginia but spent most of his youth in Edwardsville , Illinois . In 1825 he was indicted for the murder of a family acquaintance , but never went to trial . Upon the outbreak of the Black Hawk War in 1832 , Stephenson raised a company and saw combat , suffering severe wounds at the Battle of Waddams Grove . After the war ended Stephenson entered public life , and served as a member of the Illinois State Senate in 1834 . In December 1837 Stephenson was nominated as the Democratic candidate for Governor of Illinois . Within six months of his nomination , accusations of embezzlement were leveled against him , and he was forced to withdraw from the election . In August 1838 , Stephenson died at home of tuberculosis . 
 = = Early life = = 
 James W. Stephenson was born in Virginia in 1806 , the oldest son of Benjamin Stephenson and his wife , Lucy , and was named in honor of his grandfather and uncle . The Stephenson family came to Edwardsville from Kaskaskia in 1816 , and in 1820 the family moved into the Benjamin Stephenson House in Edwardsville . 
 On January 29 , 1825 , while at the Wiggins Hotel in lower town , area resident Daniel D. Smith was stabbed to death following an argument with James Stephenson , James Henry and <unk> Winchester . Smith was stabbed in the neck ; as those present attended to him , he uttered " Winchester " and died . Reports in Edwardsville 's The Spectator indicated that Smith was " killed in an affray " at the Stephenson House . James W. Stephenson , James D. Henry and <unk> Winchester were indicted for Smith 's murder . All three men were charged with the crime , though only Stephenson and Henry were released on bond . 
 Winchester was the only defendant to face trial on the charges . Winchester 's lawyer argued that Smith was guilty of verbal assault against the defendant , and Winchester was found not guilty . The verdict was reported in The Spectator on March 22 , 1825 . In 1828 Stephenson left Edwardsville , and moved to Galena in Jo Daviess County where he made his home for much of the rest of his life .

 As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement , the tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828 . However , Sauk leader Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty , claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted , nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands . Angered by the loss of his birthplace , between 1830 – 31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River into Illinois , but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed . In April 1832 , encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British , he again moved his so @-@ called " British Band " of around 1 @,@ 000 warriors and non @-@ combatants into Illinois . Finding no allies , he attempted to return to Iowa , but the undisciplined Illinois militia 's actions led to the Battle of Stillman 's Run . A number of other engagements followed , and the militias of Michigan Territory and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk 's Band . The conflict became known as the Black Hawk War .

 As an officer in the Illinois militia James W. Stephenson served in a combat command capacity during the war . He first raised a company of 134 men in the early stages of the war as a captain , later , he was elected major and his company was taken over by Captain Enoch Duncan . Stephenson 's company was mustered into service in May and was released on September 14 , 1832 . 
 Stephenson fought in battles during the war as well as playing a role in the prelude and aftermath of some of the fighting . At the June 18 , 1832 Battle of Waddams Grove Stephenson led a dozen men against an unknown number of hostile Sauk . The battle , which descended into a hand @-@ to @-@ hand fight , resulted in three of Stephenson 's men being killed . Stephenson was shot and severely wounded in the encounter . Though Waddams Grove did little to put an end to Sauk raids in the region , it did help bolster public confidence in the militia . Less than two weeks later , Stephenson was involved in the aftermath of the raid at Sinsinawa Mound , in present @-@ day Grant County , Wisconsin . When news of the attack at Sinsinawa Mound reached Galena , Captain Stephenson set out with 30 soldiers to pursue the raiders . Once at Sinsinawa , they buried the " most shockingly mutilated " dead at the mound ; both of the men killed , John Thompson and John Boxley , had been scalped , and Thompson 's heart was missing . Stephenson followed the Sauk trail to the Mississippi River and stopped , the raiders having apparently crossed the river . Stephenson 's party returned to Galena without finding the group responsible for the attack . 
 In the week preceding another of the war 's major turning points , the June 16 Battle of Horseshoe Bend , Stephenson helped Colonel Henry Dodge and his men bury the victims of the St. Vrain massacre . Stephenson continued on to Galena after assisting in this task and did not accompany Dodge to Horseshoe Bend . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Stephenson was well @-@ connected , and received letters from prominent people , including Jefferson Davis in 1834 . That same year , Stephenson was elected to his first public office , the Illinois State Senate , after which he sought an appointment to the Land Office in Galena . From December 1834 until April 1835 Stephenson was absent from Galena . He spent time in St. Louis , where he married Ellen Kyle in December , then traveled on to Edwardsville and Vandalia , Illinois ; the couple eventually had two children . In April 1835 the couple returned to Galena where James took office as Register of Lands at Galena and Chicago , and they lived an elegant lifestyle . 
 In December 1837 , at the first " regularly constituted " Illinois state Democratic convention in Vandalia , James W. Stephenson was nominated as the party 's candidate for governor of Illinois . Within six months of his nomination , Stephenson was caught in a funds embezzling scandal , surrounding his time as Register of Lands , and forced to withdraw from the election . The Democrats reconvened their convention on June 6 , 1838 and nominated Thomas Carlin , a " most unexceptionable man " who had a reputation for being honest . 
 Older accounts of Stephenson 's withdrawal from the race give differing reasons for his departure . Former Democratic Illinois Governor Thomas Ford 's 1854 A History of Illinois stated that Stephenson 's reason for withdrawing from the election was " on account of sickness . " James Washington Sheahan wrote in his 1860 biography of Stephen A. Douglas that Stephenson 's early exit from the election was due to being " charged with being a <unk> . " John Moses ' 1 @,@ 316 @-@ page work , Illinois , Historical and Statistical ( 1889 ) , characterized the accusations against Stephenson as " serious charges . "

 Less than a week after Carlin was elected governor of Illinois , Stephenson died of tuberculosis in August 1838 . He died at his home in Galena , at the age of 32 . He was buried the day of his death with military honors and left behind his wife , Ellen , and two children Lucy and Kyle . 
 = Askam and Ireleth = 
 Askam and Ireleth is a civil parish close to Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness in the county of Cumbria , in North West England . Historically part of Lancashire , it originally consisted of two separate coastal villages with different origins and histories which , in recent times , have merged to become one continuous settlement . The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 Census was 3 @,@ 632 . 
 Ireleth has its origins as a mediaeval farming village clustered on the hillside overlooking the flat sands of the Duddon Estuary . Askam was established following the discovery of large quantities of iron ore near the village in the middle of the 18th century . 
 The pair originally fell within the boundaries of the Hundred of Lonsdale ' north of the sands ' in the historic county of Lancashire , but following local government reforms in 1974 became part of the county of Cumbria , along with the rest of Furness . 
 The nearby River Duddon estuary and surrounding countryside have made the area well known for its wildlife , while the villages ' exposed position on the eastern bank facing the Irish Sea have encouraged the establishment of wind energy generation , amid local controversy . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Ireleth = = = 
 Ireleth is the smaller and older of the two villages , with its origins stretching back to the Viking occupation of Britain . It was originally clustered along a stream , named ' Hole Beck ' , about half a mile up the hill from the estuary below . It was also the junction of four roads passing through the area . Firstly , there was the ' Sands ' road , named ' Marsh Lane ' in maps of the 1850s , heading down the hill towards the shore , where it met one of the possible routes for crossing the treacherous tidal sands of the Duddon at low tide . Secondly , there was the lane heading north along a ridge towards Kirkby @-@ in @-@ Furness . Part of these two roads form today 's A595 main road . There was also a road leading up the stream 's valley towards the hamlet of Marton , and finally a road east over the hills towards Dalton @-@ in @-@ Furness . 
 Viking origins exist in two forms : remains have been found near St. Peter 's parish church and the name of the village itself is Viking , translated from the Old Norse as ' hill @-@ slope of the Irish ' . 
 It is thought the village was included in the Domesday Book , compiled soon after the Norman Conquest , but there is debate over which of the entries for the Furness area in William the Conqueror 's census actually refers to modern day Ireleth . Several sources name a settlement called <unk> , part of the Manor of <unk> , as the correct entry but there is no conclusive evidence to support this , not least because of the discrepancies in spelling . Samuel Lewis ' A Topological Dictionary of England , written 1848 , posits a different contender as the true Ireleth . He claimed <unk> referred to the village because of the existence of a mill named Orga @-@ Mill , but he conceded this was also conjecture . Lewis ' full text on Ireleth is below . 
 During the Middle Ages , the entire area was controlled by the Cistercian monks of Furness Abbey . During this time , Ireleth was little more than one of many farming communities in Furness . The iron ore developments of Askam largely bypassed Ireleth , and the village developed slowly , housing farmers and workers from local towns . The religious history of the village is recorded as starting around the year 1608 , when an endowment was created to fund a village school . Giles Brownrigg , named variously as a local landowner or a tailor who had left the area to make his fortune in London , gave money to establish a school house and a salary for a schoolmaster . This building existed on what is today Sun Street ; the only remains today are a font and a plaque , kept in the modern day school building , inscribed : 
 Ireleth featured in the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales . In this , it is <unk> 
 Ireleth did not have a parish church at this point , falling into the ' Above Town ' area , together with the hamlets of Marton and <unk> , of the parish of Dalton @-@ in @-@ Furness . Lacking a place of worship , it was decided the newly built school could also be put to use as a chapel . Fishwick 's ' Lancashire & Cheshire Church Surveys , 1649 – 1655 ' of 1849 cites this record from a church survey taken in 1650 : 
 In 1860 , Ireleth , along with the newly founded Askam , petitioned for the creation of its own parish following the rapid increase in population . Construction of a parish church began , with the money to build St. Peter 's coming from the new @-@ found profits of iron ore mining , giving rise to the name the ' Iron Church ' . It was dedicated for use on St. Peter 's Day , 29 June 1865 , but approval for a new ecclesiastical parish of ' Ireleth @-@ with @-@ Askam ' did not come until almost ten years later in 1874 . 
 = = = Askam = = = 
 Askam 's history starts much more recently . In 1850 , iron ore deposits were discovered in the area by Henry Schneider . These turned out to be the second largest iron ore deposits in the country , with over 7 million tons of ore extracted . By 1896 , 547 men were employed in the pits by the village and in nearby <unk> , 347 of them underground . Several hundred others worked in local mines at <unk> ( between Ireleth and Dalton @-@ in @-@ Furness ) , <unk> and Dalton . Some were owned by the Kennedy Brothers Ltd. firm of Ulverston Barrow Haematite Steel Co and the Millom and Askam Iron Company . The latter built four blast furnaces in the village to smelt the iron ore being brought from mines all over the peninsula by rail . The village continued to grow with terraced houses and allotments erected for the flood of immigrant labour needed to work the mines . They came from all parts of the British Isles , with a large proportion coming from existing mining areas in Cornwall and Ireland . The Cornish in particular tended to bring their families and settle , while the Irish often moved on to wherever there was work . Others came from areas where Askam 's mine owners had other concerns , such as Scotland and Wales . 
 Remnants of the steel industry remain in Askam , as evidenced by a pier , consisting of slag from the works , that juts out into the bay toward Millom . Also , numerous streets are named after the industry and its owners . For example , ' Steel Street ' is so named because of the steel industry ; ' Sharp Street ' is named after Joseph Sharp , one of the earliest people involved in Askam 's steel industry ; and ' Crossley Street ' after William Crossley , an early investor in the Askam steel industry . The large numbers of slag banks left by the steel industry around the village are now important sites for wildlife . By 1918 , the iron ore had run out and most of the industrial buildings were demolished in 1933 . Since then , Askam has grown with commuter homes , exploiting the views over the Duddon Estuary to the Lake District . 
 Askam and Ireleth 
 Askam and Ireleth are both part of the Furness peninsula , where the suffix " -in @-@ Furness " is sometimes added to place names , such as Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness and Dalton @-@ in @-@ Furness . Askam , when referred to on its own , often uses this but it is rare for Ireleth to be called Ireleth @-@ in @-@ Furness . A possible explanation for this is that the majority of in @-@ Furness place names were inventions of the railway that either created the settlements or caused their rapid expansion ; Ireleth , untouched by the railway , was not affected by this convention . However , Ireleth is often confused in archival records with ' Kirkby Ireleth ' , the former name for the community ( two miles to the north ) now known as Kirkby @-@ in @-@ Furness . These communities are differentiated in the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales . 
 While the strip development has effectively created one larger community in the past fifty years , residents of both villages still retain a strong sense of being either from Askam or Ireleth . Road signs read ' Askam and Ireleth ' on entering the villages by road , but an older ' A595 – Ireleth ' sign still stands on the former boundary between the two . 
 In administration terms , the civil parish of which they are both part uses the name Askam with Ireleth , as does the local Women 's Institute ( WI ) which had previously been called Ireleth WI . 
 = = Environment = = 
 The upper slopes of the hill near Ireleth are home to dark blue slate and is found on the roofs of several local dwellings . Haematite , the bright red iron ore , was discovered in an exceptionally large deposit — the second largest in the country — south of the current villages in the 1840s . Askam sprung up on the Ireleth marshes as a home for the miners attacking the new deposit . The other mineral found in large quantities , conveniently with a commercial use , is shale . This is fired with water to make red brick , and the brickworks , which is still operational today , was built in 1845 to exploit this . 
 Much wildlife is found on the Duddon Estuary , perhaps most notably 20 % of the national natterjack toad population , who are attracted to the shallow breeding pools . The <unk> around Askam are also very important as nesting sites for the rare Sandwich terns that live in the area . The beach is designated an Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) because of the range of flora and fauna present on the sands . 
 The Askam and Ireleth Wind Farm can be found two kilometres east of the village , on the southern slopes of Hare Slack Hill . Work on the turbines started in late 1998 , and the wind farm took eight months to complete . 
 The Marton , Askam and Ireleth <unk> Action Group ( <unk> ) was one of the first such organisations in the UK dedicated to fighting windfarm development . 
 = = Location and transport = = 
 The A595 is the main coastal route , designated a primary route , connecting Dalton and Carlisle via the Cumbrian Coast . Its southern end is two miles ( 3 km ) south of Askam at the junction with the <unk> Dalton @-@ in @-@ Furness bypass although formerly continued into Dalton . The area is served by Stagecoach Cumbria service , 7A and X7 as well as various school services . There are plans to construct a crossing over the Duddon between Askam and Millom to reduce the long journey times between Furness and Copeland , due to the circuitous route of the A595 around the estuary . A scheme to build such a ' Duddon Crossing ' remains at the planning stage , but is nominated as a future project in county transport planning . 
 Askam is located on the 150 @-@ mile ( 240 km ) Cumbrian Coastal Walk , which winds around the edge of the county . The railway line passing through the two villages virtually bisecting them , with a bridge and a level crossing by the station allowing people to cross the line . There is a stop called Askam Railway Station . Services run south to Barrow and some continue on to the West Coast Mainline at Lancaster . To the north the lines links to the Sellafield nuclear power plant , a major local employer , and onwards to Carlisle . 
 = = Politics and demographics = = 
 As a civil parish , the villages have a parish council which usually meets monthly , normally the third Tuesday of each month . All eight councillors will be up for election at the forthcoming English local government elections on 3 May 2007 . The villages also fall into the Dalton North ward of the borough , with voters electing three councillors to represent them on the council . The ward also elects one councillor to represent it on Cumbria County Council . It is part of the Barrow and Furness parliamentary constituency , represented by Labour MP John Woodcock . According to the most recent census , in 2001 , the population of the ( civil ) parish is 3 @,@ 632 , with an even balance of male and female . 
 = = Sport = = 
 The villages have several sporting facilities , including the Fallowfield Park rugby league ground , home of Askam Amateur Rugby League Football Club . Formed in 1879 , the amateur club is a member of British Amateur Rugby League Association and in 2007 – 2008 were elected to the National Conference League Division 2 , but withdrew before the start of the season . There is Askam United Football Club who play in the West Lancashire Football League Division Two and Duddon SC , a cricket team based at the old K Shoes factory social club , now called Duddon Sports and Social Club . There is also a newly formed junior football team and due to playing on the Sports Club pitches , has taken the name of Duddon Sports Junior Football Club . 
 A 10 @-@ hole links golf course , belonging to the <unk> Golf Club , lies to the north of Askam . The course has one particularly interesting feature , namely a green atop <unk> Rock , a large <unk> limestone rock which stands out from the surrounding flat course and sands . The golf club has been in existence since 1905 .

 Askam and Ireleth has four village halls : Temperance Hall in Ireleth , Askam Community Centre ( formerly part of Askam School ) which was refurbished in 2010 , Band Hall in Sandy Lane , the home of Askam & Ireleth Silver Band , the local brass band , and venue for dances , and Rankin Hall in Askam . Temperance Hall was built by the Quakers in 1872 ; it was marked as a place of worship on Ordnance Survey maps of the late 19th century , and was used by the Bible Christians , a Methodist denomination . It later fell out of use as a religious centre , being marked on maps in 1913 as simply a hall . The Temperance Hall was closed before being renovated in the 1990s , and is now used as a community centre and the location of parish council alternate months with the Rankin Hall , which is also the meeting place for the local Women 's Institute . 
 As already mentioned , there is St. Peter 's Church overlooking the two villages atop Ireleth Hill , which is the oldest of the churches in the villages , and holds the only churchyard in the villages and adjoins the local cemetery ; and the Temperance Hall that was once used as a church . There are three other places of worship within the village . 
 In 1907 , at a cost of £ 350 , The Christian Meeting House was built on Crossley Street in Askam , as a Church of Christ Church . This became , in 1956 , St. Anthony 's Catholic Church , and is still used in that capacity today . Sadly it is due to close by the end of 2009 . On Duddon Road , in Askam , there is also a Methodist Church , called Duddon Road Church . This is a shared building with the Church of England and is the headquarters of the local scouts , cubs , beavers , rainbows and brownies . 
 There were once two other churches in the village , but they are no longer in use as Churches . Zion , on Beach Street , Askam , was a Primitive Methodist church that was founded in 1870 . It closed in 1985 . There was also a United Methodist Church in Askam , and though the building still stands on Duke Street , it is now used as a social club . The Church was opened in 1878 , on land that was donated by the Furness Iron and Steel Company. and became the Rankin Hall ( see above ) The Gospel hall on Duke Street closed some five years ago . 
 There is a lifeboat station , home of the Duddon Inshore Rescue , that was established in 1970 . Askam has a fountain commemorating Queen Victoria 's Jubilee . There are two schools , Ireleth St Peter 's CE Primary School and Askam Village School , both of which are primary schools . There are no secondary schools in the village . There is a public library in Lord Street in Askam . It was originally built in 1904 as a reading room branch of Dalton @-@ in @-@ Furness Library . 
 = Orochimaru ( Naruto ) = 
 Orochimaru ( <unk> ) is a fictional character from the Naruto universe created by Masashi Kishimoto and developed into a media franchise , which consists of a series of manga , anime , soundtracks , OVAs , movies , video games , and other collectibles . He was created as one of the series ' main antagonists , and intended to represent the opposite of the protagonists ' morals and values . 
 In the anime and manga , Orochimaru is a former ninja of the village of Konohagakure who is known for his abilities . However , creating his ninja village Otogakure as means to perform inhuman experimentation , Orochimaru sought a means to gain power and cheat death . In the latter , Orochimaru obtained a means for immortality by transferring between different host bodies which became one of his driving motivations throughout the series as he targets Sasuke Uchiha for his genetic heritage . While the main antagonist in Part I of the series , Orochimaru 's role became overshadowed by the Akatsuki prior to the Fourth Ninja War arc . Orochimaru has appeared in media outside the Naruto anime and manga , including several video games . 
 Several anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Orochimaru 's character . As one of the series ' premier villains , he has been praised in this regard ; IGN compared his character to Darth Vader of Star Wars fame . His lack of redeeming qualities and open malevolence was also praised by reviewers , with Mania.com calling him the " first real villain " of the series . Among the Naruto reader base , Orochimaru has been popular , ranking within the top twenty characters in several polls . Numerous pieces of merchandise in Orochimaru 's likeness have also been released , including action figures and plush dolls . 
 = = Creation and conception = = 
 As one of the villains in the story , Kishimoto created Orochimaru as an antithesis to the protagonists ' values . His snake @-@ like appearance and related features were intended to make it easier for the reader to recognize that he is a villain . In an interview , Kishimoto asserted that making the villains " flamboyant " was one of his " guiding principles , " and attributed this to his desire to have the villains have a " powerful aura . " When asked if Orochimaru was still good , Kishimoto answered that Orochimaru is " truly good " and that he is one of the several " hopeless evil characters " that appear in the series . 
 Following this theme of distinguishing villains , Kishimoto attempted to make Orochimaru 's face appear " pasty and sickly , " which serves to emphasize the " scary looks " that Kishimoto frequently has Orochimaru performing in the manga . Orochimaru 's nature type is fire , earth , and wind . As these occurrences are his " trademark , " Kishimoto modifies Orochimaru 's appearance and the scene to focus on Orochimaru 's face ; for instance , highlights that are normally added to Orochimaru 's hair are removed and the background is blanked out to create a " creepy atmosphere . "

 Orochimaru acts as the primary antagonist for the first part of the series . After his parents were killed when he was young , Orochimaru 's only source of affection was received from his teacher , the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi , and his two teammates . As they grew older Orochimaru , Jiraiya , and Tsunade collectively became known as the " Legendary <unk> " ( <unk> , Densetsu no <unk> ) due to their exemplary ninja abilities in the Second Great Ninja War against <unk> . Much of Orochimaru 's arsenal of abilities deals with snakes , using them in summoning to battle multiple opponents while simultaneously keep himself out of harm 's way . Through his experimentations he has also been able to add some snake @-@ like characteristics to his own body . Desiring immortality to learn every jutsu , Orochimaru developed a forbidden jutsu to steal his victim 's body . Though essentially immortal , Orochimaru learns the process can not be done more than once every three years . 
 Orochimaru , however , craved more power than could be obtained from training with his master , and began abducting villagers of Konohagakure for various experiments with Yamato among his surviving victims . Unwilling to bring himself to harm Orochimaru upon learning of his actions , Hiruzen allowed his former pupil to escape and flee the village . In time Orochimaru joined the criminal organization Akatsuki and became partners with a fellow Rogue Ninja named Sasori . However , after his attempt to steal the body of Itachi Uchiha through a forbidden jutsu so as to gain the Sharingan failed , Orochimaru is forced to leave the Akatsuki . Orochimaru then founded his own ninja village , Otogakure , populated with ninja loyal to him who mostly serve as test subjects in his experimentation to become an ultimate being and as pawns to do his dirty work . 
 During the Chunin Exams , Orochimaru plans the invasion of Konoha with the ninja of Sunagakure to not only kill Hiruzen but also claim the body of Itachi 's brother Sasuke Uchiha . To that end , Orochimaru infiltrated the Chunin Exam 's Forest of Death round by killing a Grass ninja named <unk> and assuming his identity to personally test Sasuke before branding him with a Curse Mark once satisfied with the youth 's abilities . For the duration of the Exams , Orochimaru laid in wait and secretly murdered the Fourth Kazekage to assume his identity and get close to his mentor as the invasion begins . However , Orochimaru is forced to retreat when Hiruzen sacrifices himself through the Reaper Death Seal to take away Orochimaru 's ability to perform jutsu with his forces pulling back while Sunagakure later learns of Orochimaru 's treachery . Wanting to regain the ability to use jutsu , Orochimaru attempted to get aid from Tsunade before seeking out another way to cure himself . When all his efforts prove unsuccessful , Orochimaru sends his Sound Four to fetch Sasuke , hoping that a body @-@ transfer will allow him to use his arms again . Though he waits as long as he can , Sasuke takes too long to arrive and Orochimaru is forced to switch to the body of one of his prisoners instead . Once Sasuke arrives , still unable to use ninjutsu despite having functional arms again , Orochimaru decides to train him instead until the day that he will be able to take the body for himself . 
 Two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years later , in the second part of the series , Orochimaru confronts Naruto and his friends when they attempted to track down Sasuke . Taunting Naruto , Orochimaru manages to hold his own after the youth is being consumed by the Nine Tails chakra . Later , when Sasuke attempts to kill Naruto , Orochimaru stays his hand by pointing out the boy 's use in taking down the Akatsuki and thus lessening the number of enemies he has . Eventually , when his host body begins to fail him , Orochimaru is left with no other choice but to proceed with the body @-@ switch sooner than expected as he reveals the mass of white snakes that he became as the result of his self experimentation . Sasuke , unwilling to give himself up to a weakened Orochimaru , uses his Sharingan to void Orochimaru 's technique and retains control of his body while trapping Orochimaru 's soul within him . The suppression , in turn , gives Sasuke access to many of Orochimaru 's abilities in the process . During Sasuke 's later fight with Itachi , Sasuke is left too weak to continue suppressing Orochimaru 's soul , allowing Orochimaru to escape and try to take his body again . Before he can do so , Itachi , using the legendary sword of Totsuka , seals him away . 
 In the aftermath of Kabuto 's defeat and needing answers , Sasuke exposes Orochimaru 's survival as the Cursed Seals are revealed to hold a copy of Orochimaru 's consciousness in it along with the cells of Orochimaru that Kabuto injected into himself and subjugated . Using the Cursed Seal Orochimaru placed on his former student , Anko <unk> , Sasuke releases Orochimaru and gives him a new body which Jugo provides with an absorbed part of Kabuto 's flesh . Despite expressing no interest in the ongoing war and still desiring to claim Sasuke 's body , Orochimaru then joins Sasuke in his quest for answers over the nature of ninja , taking him and Taka to the Nara Shrine where he undoes the Reaper Death Seal and regains the use of ninjutsu before transferring his being into one of the White <unk> clones placed on Sasuke . In his new body , Orochimaru then brings the first four Hokage back to life with the Reanimation Jutsu to give Sasuke the answers he wants . Once Sasuke got his answer from Hashirama , out of curiosity to see his former apprentice 's new path while the actions of Madara and Obito jeopardize his laboratories , Orochimaru offers to help the Allied Shinobi Forces by first coming to the aid of Tsunade and the Kage and assist in subduing the Shinju . After the Fourth Great Ninja War ended , among those caught under Madara 's Infinite Tsukiyomi before being freed , Orochimaru resumes his experiments with Team Taka ( minus Sasuke who returns to Konoha ) supporting him as lab assistants , though Konoha remains suspicious of him and keeps tabs on him in case he resumes his former human experimentation activities . Over the next several years , Orochimaru creates an artificial human , whom he names Mitsuki , and refers to him as his son . At some point , he sends Mitsuki to live in Konoha after helping Mitsuki decide his choice of what path in life he prefers . In Naruto Gaiden : The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring , Orochimaru was approached by Sasuke regarding a boy with the Sharingan , and Orochimaru revealed that most of his Sharingan research is tied to his highly adaptive test subject : A Uchiha @-@ fanatic named <unk> in Boruto : Naruto the Movie , Orochimaru is seen watching his son with his teammates .

 Orochimaru so far has only appeared in the fifth Naruto film , Naruto Shippūden 2 : Bonds . He is not present in the other four films in the series , had a small part in fifth OVA " The Cross Roads " , and is mentioned and makes a cameo appearance in the post @-@ credit scene of Boruto : Naruto the Movie . Orochimaru is a playable character in nearly all Naruto video games , including the Clash of Ninja series and the Ultimate Ninja series . In some games , he utilizes variations of his techniques not seen in the anime or manga , and in the second installment of the Ultimate Ninja series , his state after his arms were sealed by the Third Hokage is available as a separate character .

 Orochimaru has been featured consistently in the Weekly Shonen Jump popularity polls , commonly placing in the top twenty characters . However , in the last popularity poll , he was out of the top thirty characters . Merchandise based on Orochimaru has also been released , including action figures , plush dolls , and key chains . AnimeCentral listed him as tenth best villain in anime owing to his objectives and methods , most notably how he scares Sasuke Uchiha the first time seeing him despite Sasuke 's strength . 
 Several publications for manga , anime , video games , and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Orochimaru 's character . IGN compared Orochimaru 's search for power and subsequent fall into villainy to that of Darth Vader , and labeled Orochimaru as " something more than just pure evil . " Mania Entertainment considered Orochimaru the " first real villain " of the series , noting that he had no redeeming qualities , as versus <unk> <unk> , the villain of the previous arc . DVDTalk celebrated the introduction of Orochimaru into the series , as well as the potential plot development from the curse seal Orochimaru placed on Sasuke , noting it was one of the best parts of the series . Instead , Anime News Network labeled Orochimaru to be a character that can not be killed . However , they considered Kujira , Orochimaru 's Japanese voice actress , as one of the best ones from the series . 
 Despite the character 's small appearances in Part II , most of them were well received . The way Orochimaru angers Naruto Uzumaki in their battle as well as how he manages events ever since his reintroduction have been deemed as " near perfectly " by Mania 's Chris Beveridge . Orochimaru 's fight against Sasuke in later parts from the series was praised by <unk> 's Park Cooper due to how it changes " the nature of things " in a short time . While agreeing with Cooper , Beveridge found that the fight did not bring a certain end to Orochimaru which he thought it would have made it more entertaining . On the other hand , Beveridge liked how during the fight between the two a flashback showed Orochimaru 's backstory in Konoha , which helped in expanding his character . His apparent redemption to follow Sasuke in later parts of the story was criticized by writer Jason Thompson .

" Hal Epperson , coordinator of the group 's unit in Phoenix , Arizona , stated that the group was " a nonviolent group that has a lawful remedy for the corporate government . " 
 Some members of the group stated that they were influenced by Martin Luther King , Jr. and Mohandas Gandhi . On their website , the Guardians of the Free Republics called for a " Restore America Plan " that included a " bold achievable strategy for behind @-@ the @-@ scenes peaceful reconstruction of the de jure institutions of government without controversy , violence or civil war . " The group advocated the end of " tax prosecutions for resisting the transfer of private wealth to foreign banking cartels " and issuing " orders to the military and police powers to enforce the Peoples ’ divine rights of birth . " The Guardian of the Free Republics stated that they wanted to accomplish their goals " Behind the scenes , lawfully , peacefully , without violence and without risking civil war . " A section of their website titled " Rationale " laid out the ideas behind the group ’ s goal to " restore Biblical law to a devoutly secular population . " The group believed its plan could act as a " vehicle for relieving corporate tyranny . In due time , the higher goal of salvaging the souls of mankind can be addressed . "

 During the week of March 31 , 2010 , all 50 U.S. state governors received letters from the group , warning them to leave office within three days or be removed . Governor Mike Beebe of Arkansas said , " It basically said , resign , ask for forgiveness and then we 'll reinstate you , and if you sign this we 'll consider you re @-@ elected . " 
 The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security stated that they did not believe the group was violent . Some investigators believed , however , that the letters could cause others to commit violent acts . John <unk> , who runs Republic Broadcasting Network in Round Rock , Texas , which broadcast Sam Kennedy 's weekly show , said that Kennedy was behind the idea of sending out the letters . The FBI interviewed Kennedy for two hours on April 2 , 2010 , but did not arrest him . The interview concentrated on two shows Kennedy did about the " Restore America " project , in which Kennedy set a March 31 , 2010 deadline as the day to " begin to reclaim the continent . "

 Soon I Will Be Invincible is a novel by Austin Grossman . It was published by Pantheon Books and released on June 5 , 2007 . The novel uses two alternating first person narratives . One narrative is told from the point of view of Fatale , a female cyborg who is recruited by the superhero group The New Champions as they investigate the disappearance of superhero CoreFire . The other narrative is told from the point of view of Dr. Impossible , a supervillain who possesses super @-@ human strength and intellect and suffers from Malign Hypercognition Disorder ( " evil genius " syndrome ) , as he escapes from jail and makes his thirteenth attempt at taking over the world . 
 It is Austin Grossman 's first novel . He was better known as a video game designer but was studying literature . While the book uses characters , settings , and storylines generally associated with comic books and superhero fiction , it is written entirely in prose . The story looks at how superheroes cope with their powers and interact with one another . The potential motivations and perspectives of supervillains are also explored . The book has been variously described as clever , engaging , and fun — but overstuffed with comic book tropes . An audiobook was released along with the hardcover and a movie has been in development since 2008 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The novel Soon I Will Be Invincible is the first novel by Austin Grossman , a man better known for designing video games . Grossman had come from a literary family , son of Judith and Allen Grossman and brother of Lev Grossman , which had fostered his ambition to write his own novel . Instead , Grossman accepted a job working in the video game medium which he credited with teaching him to realistically portray creative characters and situations . He always had an interest in the superhero genre , citing Alan Moore and Frank Miller as literary influences . In the mid @-@ 1990s , the idea behind what would become his first novel came to him in the form of a supervillain 's voice . Grossman spent the next few years casually developing the character that would become Dr. Impossible , adding supporting characters , and writing short stories . By 2006 , Penguin 's imprint Michael Joseph purchased the publishing rights for the UK , as did Rizzoli for an Italian version . By the time , the book was being published Grossman was 37 years old and had entered the University of California @-@ Berkeley 's doctoral program studying English Literature , specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After CoreFire , the world 's greatest superhero , goes missing , the former members of The Champions re @-@ unite to investigate his disappearance , bringing in two new replacement heroines , Lily and Fatale . They immediately suspect CoreFire 's nemesis , Dr. Impossible , was involved , even though he has been incarcerated in a maximum security prison since his defeat by Damsel during his twelfth world domination attempt . An interrogation by two novice heroes about CoreFire 's disappearance gives Dr. Impossible the chance to escape and initiate a new attempt at world domination . The New Champions search for Impossible , convinced he is responsible for CoreFire 's demise , while he gathers the materials needed to advance his plan . This is intercut with flashbacks to earlier times and his origin , as well as reflections on other paths he could have taken in life . 
 Fatale observes the actions of the New Champions as its newest member . She feels uncomfortable replacing a popular , deceased member and unworthy of belonging to a superhero group , but she proves herself to be highly competent and earns the respect of her teammates . Fatale 's closest friend on the team is another new member , Lily , a reformed supervillain and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible . Fatale contrasts Dr. Impossible 's flashbacks by having no memory of her life before the accident in Brazil that made her a cyborg , with her exposition coming from her new experiences with the other superheroes . During the investigation , she discovers that the corporation that transformed her into a cyborg was a front for Dr. Impossible during one of his previous plans . 
 The climax is reached on Dr. Impossible 's island , as he attempts to start a controlled Ice Age , making him Earth 's ruler and only source of energy . He almost succeeds , using the hammer formerly belonging to the supervillain The Pharaoh to defeat the New Champions . CoreFire suddenly returns but is also unsuccessful against Dr. Impossible . Lily , who had quit the team earlier , eventually returns and defeats Dr. Impossible . Lily reveals that she is actually Erica Lowenstein , Dr. Impossible 's childhood crush before his transformation and frequent <unk> when she was the girlfriend of CoreFire . In the final chapter , Dr. Impossible ponders what it truly means to conquer the world , and whether such a feat can really be achieved , as he prepares for yet another escape from custody to start the cycle all over again with a new plan .

 The story is divided into 21 chapters , with each chapter switching between the points @-@ of @-@ view of the supervillain Dr. Impossible and the superhero Fatale . The narrative is written in the first person , like a memoir , describing the inner monologues of the two protagonists . The dual narrative foils and " blur [ s ] the distinction " between the superheroes and the supervillain . The language was described as having a " sincere tone of glory " and " boyish indulgence " with " an undercurrent of sadness and a surprisingly human universality " . While the story uses standard comic book story elements , like superheroes fighting supervillains , the book is written entirely in prose . The story combines a satire of superhero archetypes and comic book clichés , such as the use of many superlatives , with realist elements that portray the sometimes mundane lives and everyday challenges of its characters , like coping with cybernetic body parts that weigh far more than a natural body and that react before the brain registers what is happening . Common social situations and psychological issues , like loneliness and trying to connect with a group , are also portrayed . Reviewers identified numerous themes , such as power , greed , fame , ego , loneliness , belonging , and identity . 
 = = = Characterization of superheroes = = = 
 The novel uses characters with generic superhero traits . While they are public celebrities for being heroes , the novel deals more with the personal lives of superheroes , how they cope with their powers and interact with one another . The character Fatale , being asked to join the New Champions superhero group , is used as a " useful outsider looking in " behind the scenes . They exist in a " cult of overachievement " , constantly competing and trying to distinguish themselves from one another , which results in characters as " colorful as playing cards but all from different decks , a jumble of incompatible suits and denominations dealt out for an ' Alice in Wonderland ' game . " Despite their celebrity status and heroic facade , they exist in a " mundane reality " with a normal routine ; as the villain devises new means of committing crimes and conquering the world , the heroes chat among themselves , reliving past adventures , and practice fighting one another . From the perspective of the supervillain Dr. Impossible , superheroes live in " a dumb , hackneyed world " . 
 = = = Characterization of the supervillain = = = 
 Dr. Impossible is used as an archetype or stock character supervillain . He is characterized as an evil genius or mad scientist who continually attempts to take control of the world 's population . This is seen as a sub @-@ type of the hero 's journey and his calm deconstruction of his own futile , repetitive and self @-@ destructive behaviours is compared to existentialist literature . The supervillains , especially Dr. Impossible , are portrayed as sympathetic characters afflicted with " Malign Hypercognition Disorder " , a psychological condition which makes highly intelligent people use their advantages to perform non @-@ virtuous , or evil , actions . Grossman explained that from Dr. Impossible 's point of view , he is not inherently evil but rejects societal norms : " it 's a matter of integrity — he 's sticking to his principles , doing science his own way , pursuing his goals — even if it means the entire world is against him , even if he looks ridiculous in his costume , even if he knows he 's going to lose . The superheroes are taking the conformist path , and getting all the applause . " From the literary point of view , Grossman believes the supervillains are more interesting characters , " they are usually the most dynamic characters and the most creative . ... Their plans usually start with a great invention , which gives the story all its color and energy . The hero just has to come in and smash it up . " Grossman admitted that much of the Dr. Impossible character was inspired by his feelings as a graduate student , " On the one hand , you 're supposed to be really smart , and on the other hand , it 's a humiliating experience . You 're psyched about your intellect and kind of arrogant , but at the same time , you 're [ insignificant ] in the eyes of the world . " 
 = = = Genre = = = 
 Soon I Will Be Invincible takes characters , settings , and storylines generally associated with the comic book format and re @-@ casts them using the novel 's prose format . This use of superhero fiction in an alternate format was compared to other similar , successful attempts , like Sam Raimi 's Spider @-@ Man films , Brad Bird 's The Incredibles , and the TV serial No <unk> . Several reviewers contrasted the novel 's elements of realism with Alan Moore 's Watchmen and Rick Veitch 's <unk> which portrayed a darker side of more realistic superheroes . Novels cited as being similar included Donald Barthelme 's Snow White , Robert Coover 's Stepmother , and the works of Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem . The novel format allowed for more character development , which Grossman took advantage of by portraying them as " real , human characters , with all of the foibles that come with the territory " in what one reviewer called a " hybridization of character and genre " . Grossman described it as " a book about real people who happen to be <unk> [ sic ] or supervillains " and that if it were a comic , it would be " page after page of thought balloons " . Compared to comic stories , the reviewer for the Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch wrote " The common denominator for most superhero comic books is that they don 't make fun of themselves - the believability of their stories is never called into question . They take the heroes seriously . Not so in literature . When a novel appears with comic books as its focus , its author will undoubtedly believe that his or her theme is far more important - far more serious - than the comic books that inspired them . ... tries to do it all , combining humor and comic @-@ book adventure with a literary sense of character . ... The result is a postmodern , inventive , comic @-@ book plot with literary aspirations , and its only problem is that it isn 't entirely successful as either humor or as straight adventure . "

 Soon I Will Be Invincible was published by Pantheon Books , an imprint of the Knopf Doubleday division of Random House , and released on June 5 , 2007 , as a hardcover . In the UK it was published by the Penguin Group imprint Michael Joseph . An audiobook was released at the same time featuring the voices of J. Paul Boehmer and Coleen Marlo . Grossman promoted the book by attending book signings in major American cities . In the UK it was promoted by wrapping telephone booths in advertising , in reference to Superman changing outfits in such booths . The cover art , which features photos of stereotypical comic book character clothing like a mask and gloves , by Chip Kidd was called " excellent ... [ and ] sure to attract readers " . By contrast , Bryan Hitch 's cover art on the British edition , which features hand @-@ drawn illustrations of the book 's characters , was called " counter @-@ productive ... [ or ] unnecessary " due to its graphical interpretations of characters that were deliberately written in prose only . The book was short @-@ listed for the 2007 John Sargent Sr. First Novel Prize . Work on a film adaption began in 2008 through Strike Entertainment with scripts being written Dan Weiss and Grossman . 
 Several reviewers described book as clever , well @-@ written , engaging , amusing , and fun . The prose was described as " effortless " , " colorful " , " kinetic and often witty " . Numerous reviewers thought the Dr. Impossible character was the highlight of the novel . The Library Journal review " highly recommended [ the novel ] for all public libraries " calling it " fun and thought @-@ provoking book " . In The New York Times Book Review reviewer Dave Itzkoff wrote that the novel " can 't completely measure up [ to other superhero fiction and film ] , but its ambition and persistence in the face of formidable odds make it an admirable addition to the genre " . The Publishers Weekly review noted that the comic book scenario written in a prose novel , with " thoughtfully portrayed " characters , would broaden the appeal of the genre . Similarly , regarding the comic book set @-@ up written in prose , Mat Johnson in USA Today wrote that Grossman 's " fabulist vision is meticulously captured so that it might be gleefully explored , nostalgically , within its traditional boundaries " . Journalist Carlo Wolff wrote that " it takes some time to engage because ... Grossman is so enamored of the worlds he 's fashioning that he <unk> them ... [ but it ] is a fresh , warm take on comic books , science fiction and pop culture . " The Kirkus Reviews summary notes that the action scenes are " unimpressive , interrupted by more talk as ... the battle seesaws in an arbitrary fashion . For all the special effects , a debut novel that 's lifeless and inert . " Both the reviewers for Entertainment Weekly and Christian Science Monitor gave the book a " B " grade , though the The A.V. Club gave it an " A " grade . It is currently ranked # 2 as the Best Superhero fiction Books on <unk> . 
 A musical theater adaptation of Soon I Will Be Invincible ran at Lifeline Theatre in Chicago from May to July , 2015 . 
 = Zarqa River = 
 The Zarqa River ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , Nahr az @-@ <unk> , lit . " the Blue River " ) is the second largest tributary of the lower Jordan River , after the Yarmouk River . It is the third largest river in the region by annual discharge , and its watershed encompasses the most densely populated areas east of the Jordan River . It rises in springs near Amman , and flows through a deep and broad valley ( which is identified with the biblical Jabbok River ) into the Jordan , at an elevation 1 @,@ 090 metres ( 3 @,@ 580 ft ) lower . The river is heavily polluted and its restoration is one of the top priorities for the Jordanian Ministry of the Environment . 
 The Zarqa River is commonly identified with the biblical Jabbok River ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> , Nahal <unk> ) . 
 Geologically , the Zarqa River is about 30 million years old . At the river 's origin is ' Ain Ghazal , a major archaeological site that dates back to the Neolithic . Archeological finds along the course of the river indicate the area was rich in flora and fauna in the past . The Zarqa River is well known for its amber deposits that date back to the Hauterivian era of the Early Cretaceous ( 135 <unk> ) . A remarkable flora and fauna was reported from this amber reflecting tropical <unk> conditions prevailing during the time of resin deposition ( <unk> , 2005 ; 2007 ) . 
 = = Name = = 
 The modern Arabic name , Nahr az @-@ Zarqa ' ( <unk> <unk> ) means " the blue river " , where nahr means river and <unk> ' ( <unk> ) means blue . 
 = = Biblical Jabbok = = 
 The Zarqa River is identified with the biblical river Jabbok ( Hebrew : <unk> ) . The Biblical Jacob crossed the Jabbok on his way back to Canaan , after leaving Harran . It leads west into the Sukkot Valley , from where one crosses over the Jordan and can easily reach Shechem , as Jacob eventually did . The biblical cities of <unk> and Adam are also at the mouth of the valley . 
 The river is first mentioned in connection with the meeting of Jacob and Esau , and with the struggle of Jacob with the angel ( Genesis 32 : 23 et seq . ) . It was the boundary separating the territory of Reuben and Gad from that of Ammon ( Deuteronomy 3 : 16 ) , the latter being described as lying along the Jabbok ( Numbers 21 : 24 ; Deuteronomy 2 : 37 , 3 : 16 ; Joshua 12 : 2 ) . The territory of <unk> is described as extending " from Arnon unto Jabbok " ( Numbers 21 : 24 ) , and it was reclaimed later by the King of Ammon ( Judges 11 : 13 , 22 ) . Eusebius places the river between Gerasa and Philadelphia . 
 = = Course = = 
 The headwaters of the Zarqa begin just northeast of Amman , rising from a spring named Ain Ghazal ( " Gazelle spring " ) . The river flows to the north before heading west . Rising on the eastern side of the mountains of Gilead , it runs a course of about 105 kilometers ( 65 mi ) in a wild and deep ravine before flowing into the Jordan River between <unk> and the Dead Sea , at a point 1 @,@ 090 meters ( 3 @,@ 576 ft ) below its origin . At its higher reaches , the river banks are mostly steep and canyon @-@ like . Near Ain Ghazal , two tributary wadis join the river , and it opens up into a shallow basin . It forms the border between the Jordanian administrative regions of Irbid and Balqa Governorate . 
 The river is perennial , but with a very low base flow of about 2 – million to 3 million cubic meters per month during the summer months , and as much as 5 – million to 8 million cubic meters per month during the rainy winter months . This makes it the second largest tributary of the lower Jordan River , after the Yarmouk River , and the third largest river in the region by annual discharge . Irregular floods after rain storms may increase the flow to as much as 54 million cubic meters . The median annual flow is 63 @.@ 3 million cubic meters . The total basin area is 3 @,@ 900 km2 ( 1 @,@ 500 sq mi ) the largest in Jordan . A small dam , Al @-@ <unk> dam , near the village of Dayr Alla , marks the end of the upstream portion of the river , where it is natural and fast flowing with very clear water . There is very little agriculture along the banks of the river in this region , which are very rocky . Downstream from this dam , the water level is very low , and the river banks are intensively used for agriculture , as well as grazing by sheep and goats 
 The King Talal Dam was built across the lower Zarqa in 1970 , and created a reservoir with a capacity of 55 million cubic meters , and increased in 1987 to 86 million cubic meters . When built , it was expected that the reservoir would supply water for municipal use in the Amman region . However , the current levels of pollution in the lake make the water unfit for human consumption , and it is used for irrigation only . 
 = = = Bridges = = = 
 The new Jerash Bridge crosses the Zarqa upstream of King Talal reservoir , on the road from Amman to Jerash . The bridge is the site of a gauging station where flow measurements are continuously taken . 
 In the city of Zarqa , several bridges , vehicular and pedestrian , cross the river . The earliest of these was built by the Chechen founders of the city . Current bridges include the <unk> Bridge , a vehicular bridge connecting Baha ' al @-@ Din Street with al @-@ <unk> Street and another connecting Baha ' al @-@ Din Street with King Talal Street . Two pedestrian bridges connect al @-@ <unk> Street and Baha ' al @-@ Din Street , and Wasfi al @-@ Tal Street and Petra Street . 
 = = Natural history = = 
 The geological origins of the Zarqa river are about 30 million years old , when the Jordan Rift Valley was formed . A ripple effect of its formation was the creation of side @-@ wadis . The Zarqa river carved into the western edge of one of these side wadis . The earliest exposed formations in the area date from the Triassic and early Jurassic periods , and have been named <unk> and <unk> formations . The rock formations are marine sediments , remnants of the prehistoric Tethys Sea , which used to cover the area running roughly east - west , halfway across the present Dead Sea . Along the Zarqa , we find crystalline limestone alternating with shale . The next layer is a 20 @-@ 30 meter high layer of gypsum , argillaceous <unk> lime , shales and iron @-@ rich stone and sandstone . This layer is rich in fossils . The Zarqa valley was an important passageway connecting the Eastern Desert with the Jordan Valley . 
 = = = Flora = = = 
 Archaeological finds of <unk> remains indicate that poplar and tamarix used to grow along the banks of the Zarqa , with forests of wild oak growing on the hillsides . Today , tamarix thickets are still widespread in the floodplains , and the banks are cultivated with fruit orchards and vegetable fields . Along the course of Zarqa river , water is pumped directly and used to irrigate crops of leafy vegetables such as parsley , spinach , cabbage , cauliflower and lettuce , as well as potatoes . Olive trees are also found along the river 's banks . Tulips grow on many hillsides of the river , while in the springs area and the watercourse , water vegetation is found . Natural pine forests grow in the King Talal Dam area . Along the upstream banks , where the river runs wild , one finds the common reed , oleander and Typha species . Since the waters of the Zarqa are highly contaminated , with high levels of organic matter and various chemical compounds ( especially detergents and dyes ) , the use of Zarqa water for irrigation has significantly altered the biodiversity of the natural flora , and caused the disappearance of the majority of fresh water species . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 In prehistoric times , the area was rich with fauna , and 45 distinct animal species have been identified , half of them wild animals . Domesticated goats were the most common , and gazelles were the most frequently occurring wild animal species . 
 Today , the area is still home to a diverse population of birds and mammals , and some of the breeding species found do not breed anywhere else in Jordan . Among the bird species found are the European roller , desert lark , Dead Sea sparrow , desert finch and blue @-@ cheeked bee @-@ eater . The King Talal dam has created a lake which is a habitat for migratory waterfowl and various fish species . Notable birds found in the lake area include the little bittern , cattle egrets , grey herons , white storks , common teal and Eurasian coot . The lake 's waters sustain fish , some of which are indigenous species and some are introduced species . The most common are tilapia . Migratory birds also winter in the man @-@ made pools which make up the <unk> Al @-@ Samra Sewage Treatment Plant , located in a broad depression close to Wadi <unk> , the main tributary of the Zarqa River . As many as 6 @,@ 000 white storks have been spotted roosting there . Mammals found in the area include the common otter ( Lutra lutra ) , and the Persian squirrel ( Sciurus <unk> ) . The otter is considered a threatened species . 
 = = History = = 
 'Ain Ghazal , the origin of the spring the feeds the Zarqa river , is a major archaeological site , dating back to the Neolithic period . It was continuously occupied for more than two thousand years , and the earliest finds date to 7200 BCE . ' Ain Ghazal is one of the earliest known human settlements with evidence of domesticated animals . With a population of around 3 @,@ 000 at its height , it was also one of the largest prehistoric population centers in the Near East , with about five time the population of neighboring Jericho . 
 During a 1982 survey of the Zarqa valley , a number Early Iron Age sites were discovered , concentrated along the banks of the <unk> and its tributaries . One of them , <unk> <unk> @-@ Dhahab , is under further research now . 
 Wadi <unk> , a northern tributary of the Zarqa River , flows through the modern city of Jerash . <unk> since the Bronze Age , Jerash was an important Greco @-@ Roman city known as Gerasa , home to noted mathematician <unk> . The ruins of the city are well preserved and have been extensively excavated . 
 Zarqa , Jordan 's second largest city , is built on the banks of the Zarqa River , and is the largest settlement along its course . Today , most of the land and plantations on the riverbanks are owned by the heirs of the patrician El @-@ Wir clan , the rest is owned by the Bani @-@ Hassan tribe , and other local tribes . The town of Zarqa was founded in 1902 by Chechen immigrants . Its population grew rapidly with an influx of Palestinian refugees who fled the West Bank during the Six @-@ Day War . 
 = = Environmental concerns = = 
 The Zarqa river is highly polluted . In many areas , raw sewage flows untreated directly into the river through dry riverbeds ( wadis ) , contaminating it and creating a stench which has been a cause of numerous complaints , particularly during the summer months . Though sewage treatment stations have been built in a couple of locations ( including Ain Ghazal and Khirbet As Samara ) , these stations often receive more water than they can handle . Such overflow occurs during winter floods , as well as during summer months when the population increases with the return of migrant workers to Amman . During overflow , untreated water runs directly to the Zarqa river . As a result , the Zarqa 's water is brownish colored , often with dense foam due to large amounts of organic matter . Other sources of pollutants are the illegal dumping of industrial waste , including those from textile factories , and batteries and oils from garages . 
 The river 's watershed encompasses the most densely populated areas east of the Jordan River , and it flows through an industrialized area that is home to more than 52 % of Jordan 's industrial plants , including the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company . During the summer months , treated domestic and industrial waste @-@ water compose nearly all of the flow , and substantially degrade the water quality . Coupled with over @-@ extraction of water from the underground aquifer and the naturally low base flow of the Zarqa , this has created a major problem , described as one of Jordan 's " environmental black spots " . and has made rehabilitation of the Zarqa a top priority for the Jordanian Ministry of the Environment . The restoration project is estimated to cost $ 30 million .

 Philippe Poisson ( born 1984 ) , better known as Phil Fish , is a French Canadian former indie video game designer best known for his work on the 2012 platform game Fez published by his company , Polytron Corporation . He was born and raised in Quebec , where his experiences with Nintendo games in his youth would later influence his game design . He studied game design at the Montreal National Animation and Design Centre , and worked at Ubisoft and Artificial Mind and Movement before starting Polytron in 2008 . 
 Fish was a founding member of Kokoromi , a collective that explores experimental gameplay ideas , and organized Montreal 's annual GAMMA games events . While Fez was in development , Fish worked on other unreleased games at Polytron including Super Hypercube and Power Pill . 
 Fez was released in April 2012 to widespread acclaim after a protracted five @-@ year development cycle . Its final phases of development were shown in the 2012 documentary Indie Game : The Movie , which brought Fish fame unusual for game developers . Following an online argument in July 2013 , Fish publicly announced his exit from game development , citing long @-@ term mistreatment by the industry . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Phil Fish was born Philippe Poisson in Montreal in 1984 . He was raised in Quebec , where his parents shared their interest in art and gaming with him . Fish 's father translated The Legend of Zelda into French so the two could play together . Fish credits these memories as formative , and later cited their influence on Fez . He graduated from the 2004 Design and Digital Art for Video Games program at the Montreal NAD ( National Animation and Design Centre ) . 
 Fish began his career at the video game publisher Ubisoft , where he worked on Open Season as a level designer . He was initially excited for the job but grew disenchanted with their large development teams and working conditions . Fish later described it as " the worst experience of [ his ] life " . He was later fired from the company . 
 On May 24 , 2006 , Fish won the Artificial Mind and Movement Award for Best Cut @-@ Scene at the annual NAD Center Awards of Excellence Gala . Later that year , Fish began work as a level designer at Artificial Mind and Movement , where he designed for film tie @-@ in games including The Golden Compass . 
 Fish is a founding member of Kokoromi , a group that designs and promotes experimental video games . His November 2006 Arcadia Festival event , GAMMA 01 Audio Feed , featured games that incorporated live sound . Fish planned a similar event , GAMMA 256 , for 2007 , and a third event , GAMMA 3D , for November 2008 in Montreal . Fish was invited to present a lecture on GAMMA 01 at the 2007 Game Developers Conference . He also wrote a review of the 1999 Legacy of Kain : Soul Reaver in the 2007 book Space Time Play : <unk> Between Computer Games , Architecture and Urbanism : the Next Level . Additionally , Fish has been characterized by Sean Hollister of The Verge as " notorious for voicing angry , controversial opinions about the state of video games " . 
 = = Polytron = = 
 Fish began to work with Toronto @-@ based indie developer Shawn McGrath on McGrath 's idea for a puzzle game that showed 2D views of a 3D space . Fish provided the project 's art until the partnership crumbled due to creative differences : Fish wanted their product to be more of a platform game . Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time , and incorporated the idea of voxels ( 3D pixels ) , where a 2D pixel could be seen from four sides . The game would become Fez and the game 's design , lore , and art derived from this game mechanic . Fish searched for a programmer on DeviantArt and Renaud Bédard , the first person to apply , became the game 's programmer . Fez was first announced in July 2007 and was nominated for two awards at the 2008 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival . Fish 's employer , Artificial Mind and Movement , would not let him take leave from work to attend , so Fish quit . He marked this January 2008 moment as " when I became indie " . The game received widespread attention upon its showing at the festival , leading Fish to open Polytron Corporation as a startup company with a government loan . 
 Polytron later ran out of money and was on the verge of folding when the company 's Québécois neighbor , developer @-@ producer Trapdoor , offered to help Polytron without transferring its intellectual property rights . According to Fish , the partnership saved Fez . The game was delayed several times over the next few years for which it received some notoriety . 
 In late 2009 , Polytron presented an iPhone game called Power Pill at <unk> Kucha Montreal . The game features a <unk> pill that travels through human bodies as its playable protagonist , and it uses the iPhone 's multi @-@ touch screen . GameSetWatch 's Eric <unk> compared it to Soul Bubbles and Irritating Stick . The game was developed with Alec Holowka of Infinite Ammo , and a level editor was expected to be included . While working on Fez , Fish revived a game project called Super Hypercube , which was based on Wiimote motion capture input and stereoscopic navigation . Fish felt the game would work better with the new Kinect motion tracking . The adapted game was a finalist at Indiecade 2011 . 
 Fish and Fez were featured prominently in the 2012 documentary Indie Game : The Movie , through which Fish received celebrity unusual for game developers . The film chronicles the stories of several indie developers at various stages of their games ' development cycles , and Fish is shown preparing for Fez 's booth at PAX East in March 2011 . The film presents Fish amidst a legal dispute with a former business partner that jeopardizes the game 's release . The partner , believed to be Jason DeGroot , is portrayed negatively and does not participate onscreen . The film also tracks Fish 's personal and emotional investment in the game . Eurogamer wrote that the part where Fish resolves to kill himself if he does not release his game is " the film 's most startling moment " . Rock , Paper , Shotgun wrote that Fish is portrayed as melodramatic , theatrical , and neurotic , and that the film will exacerbate his outspoken public perception . Game Informer called Fish the film 's " most memorable developer " . The film 's end credits were later revised to reflect that Fish 's business partner was not asked for input . 
 Near the end of development , Fish felt " burnt out " and that his personal health had suffered . Fez was released on April 13 , 2012 and sold 200 @,@ 000 copies in its yearlong exclusivity to the Xbox Live Arcade platform . The video game review aggregator Metacritic described reviews for the 2012 Xbox 360 Fez as " generally favorable " and those for the 2013 PC version as " universal acclaim " . While in development , Fez had won the 2012 GDC Independent Games Festival 's Seamus McNally Grand Prize , the 2011 Indiecade Best in Show and Best Story / World Design , and the 2008 GDC Independent Games Festival 's Excellence in Visual Art . Eurogamer awarded Fez a perfect score and named the " perfect , wordless sci @-@ fi parable " their 2012 Game of the Year . Fish announced eventual ports for " ' pretty much ' every platform " but the Nintendo 3DS . It sold one million copies by the end of 2013 . The New York Times 's Chris Suellentrop called Fish " a Quentin Tarantino of 8 @-@ bit gaming " . 
 A Fez sequel was announced as " one more thing " at end of the Horizon indie game press conference during the June 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo . A Twitter argument between Fish and GameTrailers journalist Marcus Beer a month later culminated in the project 's cancellation and Fish 's exit from the industry . In an episode of his show Invisible Walls , Beer had criticized Fish 's recent response to questions about Microsoft 's Xbox One self @-@ publishing policy change . On Twitter , Fish condemned the industry for its negativity before his final tweet announced the cancellation and his leave . The news came as a surprise to the rest of Polytron , which has not commented on upcoming projects other than ports since the sequel 's cancellation . Polygon listed Fish in their top 50 newsmakers of 2013 for the social power of his " caustic use of Twitter " .

 In June 2014 , Fish announced Polytron Partners — a new effort by Polytron to fund and support potential indie game efforts , like a publisher . For their first game , Polytron will work with <unk> to provide the daily operations capacity for an " interactive musical landscape anthology " game named <unk> . Fish 's personal and company records were released publicly in August 2014 as part of a spate of hacks on video game developers . Fish responded by announcing that the company and Fez property were for sale .

 = Seattle Sounders FC = 
 Seattle Sounders FC is an American professional soccer club based in Seattle , Washington . The Sounders compete in the Western Conference of Major League Soccer ( MLS ) . The club was established on November 13 , 2007 , as an MLS expansion team , making it the 15th team in the league and the third Seattle soccer club to share the name . 
 The club 's majority owner is Adrian Hanauer , and its minority owners are Joe Roth , Paul Allen and Drew Carey . Former USL Sounders coach and assistant coach Brian Schmetzer took over as interim head coach in July 2016 after the departure of Sigi Schmid . The Sounders play their home matches at CenturyLink Field . Along with several organized groups , a 53 @-@ member marching band called ' Sound Wave ' supports the club at each home match . Seattle competes with rival MLS clubs Portland and Vancouver in the Cascadia Cup . 
 The Sounders played its inaugural match on March 19 , 2009 , winning 3 – 0 over the New York Red Bulls . Seattle has set MLS records for average attendance , led the league in season ticket sales , and qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs in each of its first seven seasons . The Sounders have led MLS attendance since their inaugural season , consistently drawing an average of 50 @-@ 65 % more than the next highest @-@ drawing team in the league , LA Galaxy . The club 's announced attendance average was 43 @,@ 144 in 2012 . The team 's players have included United States men 's national soccer team captain Clint Dempsey , Shanghai Greenland Shenhua forward Obafemi Martins , Academy product and current Sunderland player DeAndre Yedlin , striker Fredy Montero , and Osvaldo Alonso . 
 The Sounders have won the Open Cup three times in a row , in four consecutive Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup final appearances . In 2014 , Seattle won their fourth U.S. Open Cup title , defeating the Philadelphia Union in overtime , 3 – 1 . For the first time in franchise history , the Sounders won the Supporters ' Shield over the LA Galaxy in the 2014 regular season , also completing their double . 
 = = History = = 
 Even before the first cities in the United States were chosen to host Major League Soccer teams , Seattle was considered a viable location for a professional team . In 1994 , as the U.S. was preparing to host the FIFA World Cup , more than 30 cities were pursuing the rights to an MLS team , Seattle being among them . However , despite the strong soccer fan base in Seattle , the absence of a soccer @-@ only stadium was a drawback to establishing an MLS team . Cities seeking consideration for an inaugural MLS team were also expected to secure 10 @,@ 000 assurances from fans for season tickets . By the June 3 , 1994 deadline for MLS team bids , Seattle organizers had secured fewer than 1 @,@ 500 such assurances . These low numbers were a result of competition between the ticket campaign for the MLS expansion team and for the American Professional Soccer League ( APSL ) Sounders expansion team . 
 In a June 14 , 1994 announcement , Seattle was not included among the first seven cities to be awarded an MLS team . Five more teams were to be announced later in the year , and to improve their chances this time , Seattle MLS organizers began working with the University of Washington to secure use of Husky Stadium as an interim stadium while they pursued the construction of a permanent soccer @-@ specific facility . In November 1994 , the start of the first MLS season was postponed until 1996 , and it was noted that the absence of an " adequate grass @-@ field facility " in the area and the presence of the new APSL Seattle Sounders team had thwarted Seattle 's MLS bid . In the end , Seattle was not among the cities chosen to establish a team during the first season of MLS . 
 In 1996 , as Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen worked with the city to build a new football stadium for his team , the potential of an MLS expansion team that could be a co @-@ tenant helped drive public support for the effort . Many of the state 's voters supported the referendum to construct Seahawks Stadium because it was also expected to be a professional soccer venue . While the stadium problem was being resolved , a new issue emerged . By 2000 , MLS was moving away from league @-@ operated teams to investor @-@ operated teams , so wealthy individuals would need to step forward for Seattle to obtain an MLS expansion team . 
 In 2003 , Seattle was again listed as a possibility for an MLS expansion team when the ten @-@ team league announced plans to expand into new markets . In 2004 , MLS commissioner Don Garber indicated that Seattle had been " very close " to receiving the expansion team ultimately awarded to Salt Lake . Adrian Hanauer , then @-@ owner of the United Soccer League 's ( USL ) Sounders ( formerly the APSL Sounders ) , was in discussions with MLS about an estimated payment of $ 1 million to secure rights to a Seattle franchise for 2006 . However , when Seattle was passed over again in 2006 , Hanauer announced that he would not be able to secure an expansion team without the help of more investors willing to cover the increasing MLS franchise fees which had grown beyond $ 10 million . 
 = = = MLS expansion arrives = = = 
 In 2007 , Hanauer teamed up with Hollywood producer Joe Roth to make another bid for MLS expansion into Seattle , at a cost of $ 30 million . Paul Allen , whose First and Goal company operated Qwest Field ( now CenturyLink Field ) , joined the ownership group that same year , making the bid the most promising yet for Seattle . During the first week of November 2007 , rumors began to build that MLS would be announcing an expansion into Seattle the following week , and that the ownership group had taken on a fourth member , TV personality Drew Carey . In a press conference on November 13 , 2007 , it was announced that Seattle had been awarded an expansion team . The announcement marked the return of top @-@ level soccer to Seattle for the first time since the dissolution of its North American Soccer League ( NASL ) team in 1983 . The announcement also meant that the Seattle Sounders of the USL First Division would play its final season the year before the new MLS franchise was formed . " Seattle Sounders FC " was announced as the team name on April 7 , 2008 , along with the team logo , colors and badge design , in a presentation held at the Space Needle . The " FC " in the team moniker stands for Football Club , but the team name is officially " Seattle Sounders FC " .

 Seattle Sounders FC , the league 's 15th team , began play in the 2009 season .

The club played its first home match on March 19 , 2009 in front of a sold @-@ out crowd of 32 @,@ 523 , defeating the New York Red Bulls 3 – 0 . During the pre @-@ match ceremonies , the first Golden Scarf was awarded to MLS Commissioner Don Garber .

The club set a state record for attendance at a soccer match on August 5 , 2009 , when 66 @,@ 848 attended a friendly match with FC Barcelona , a record which was later broken when they hosted Manchester United in front of 67 @,@ 052 fans . 
 On September 2 , 2009 , the Sounders became the second MLS expansion team in league history ( Chicago was the first ) to win the U.S. Open Cup tournament in its first season . They did so by defeating D.C. United 2 – 1 on the road at RFK Stadium . In winning the U.S. Open Cup tournament , they qualified for the preliminary round of the 2010 – 11 CONCACAF Champions League . 
 On October 17 , 2009 , the Sounders became the second MLS expansion team in league history to qualify for the playoffs in its first season .

The first match of the season was played at CenturyLink Field , with Seattle hosting a new MLS expansion team , the Philadelphia Union . The Sounders won 2 – 0 on goals from Brad Evans and Fredy Montero . However , Seattle followed the win by losing 8 of its next 14 matches . In the latter half of the regular season , Seattle reversed its fortune . The team won 10 of its last 15 matches , and clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive year with a 2 – 1 win on October 10 , 2010 at Kansas City . They finished the season with 14 wins , 10 losses , and 6 ties . In the playoffs , the Sounders were eliminated in the conference semi @-@ finals by the Los Angeles Galaxy on a 3 – 1 aggregate score . The club broke its own single @-@ season attendance record , averaging 36 @,@ 173 fans per match , and again sold out every league match . 
 The Sounders also competed in two additional competitions during the 2010 season – the CONCACAF Champions League and the U.S. Open Cup . In the Champions League , Seattle progressed through the preliminary round , beating Isidro <unk> 2 – 1 on aggregate , but was eliminated in the group stage . In the U.S. Open Cup , Seattle won matches at Portland and at home against the Los Angeles Galaxy and Chivas USA before reaching the final , which they hosted at CenturyLink Field against the Columbus Crew .

 Former Real Salt Lake general manager Garth Lagerwey was hired by the club in January 2015 , replacing Adrian Hanauer . 
 Seattle was unable to repeat their successes in the 2014 season . The season started successfully , with several key wins that saw the team at the top of the Western Conference by June . During a 2015 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup match against the Portland Timbers on June 16 , however , Obafemi Martins left the game with a groin injury and Clint Dempsey was suspended after tearing a referee 's pocketbook , though he would be called away for the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup . 
 The injury and suspension of the team 's main attacking duo led to a death spiral during the summer , with Seattle winning only one match in nine games . By late August , Martins had recovered and led the team to a 8 @-@ match unbeaten streak to secure a playoff spot , finishing 4th in the Western Conference . The Sounders had also successfully topped their group in the 2015 – 16 CONCACAF Champions League , beating the Vancouver Whitecaps and Club Deportivo Olimpia , with two wins , one draw , and one loss . Paraguayan international Nelson Haedo Valdez was signed as the club 's newest designated player , and was joined by fellow international signings Andreas <unk> and Román Torres in August 2015 ; Erik Friberg also returned to the club after his stint in Europe . 
 During the playoff 's opening knockout round , the Sounders defeated the LA Galaxy 3 – 2 , ending a " curse " for the club , who had lost to LA in each of the three previous playoff matchups . The playoff run would end in the next round , the Western Conference semifinals against FC Dallas , during a penalty shootout after both teams were tied on aggregate score after extra time in Frisco , Texas .

 On July 26 , 2016 , the Sounders and coach Sigi Schmid agreed to part ways , ending his tenure at the club . Assistant coach Brian Schmetzer was promoted to interim head coach .

The official team colors are Sounder Blue , signifying the waters of the Puget Sound ; Rave Green , representing the forests of the Pacific Northwest ; and Cascade Shale , representing the Cascade Range to the east of Seattle . Fans chose a name for the team in an online poll held between March 27 and 31 , 2008 . The initial list of possibilities – Seattle FC , Seattle Republic and Seattle Alliance – deliberately did not include Seattle Sounders in order to provide a " fresh start . " Despite the names having been selected through fan research and internal committees , the omission of the traditional Sounders name embittered many in the Seattle community . In response to the backlash , the team added a fourth " write @-@ in " option for the team name , allowing for any name to be suggested on the ballot . Of the more than 14 @,@ 500 votes received in choosing the new team name , 49 % of the votes included some form of the name " Sounders " . Upon announcing the name of the club , Hanauer acknowledged the significance of keeping with tradition : " The team playing at the highest level in our region has always been called Sounders .

 In 2012 , the club hired a consultant to explore other jersey partnerships , but ultimately added a one @-@ year extension to its Microsoft sponsorship deal in September 2013 to last through the 2014 season . A second extension signed in December 2014 , lasting through the end of the 2016 season ; the extension came amid rumors that Emirates Airlines was interested in a sponsorship as part of their marketing campaign in Seattle .

 Seattle Sounders FC plays home matches at CenturyLink Field in Seattle , also home to the Seattle Seahawks . Sounders minority owner Paul Allen is also the owner of the Seahawks , who have a 30 @-@ year lease on CenturyLink Field . Because of this relationship , the Sounders makes use of CenturyLink Field without paying rent . For Sounders matches , the pitch is called " The Xbox Pitch at CenturyLink Field " as part of the sponsorship deal with Microsoft . 
 CenturyLink Field is a 69 @,@ 000 @-@ seat stadium designed for both teams . The Sounders artificially limits the stadium 's capacity for MLS matches , with certain seating sections covered with tarpaulins to provide " a more intimate atmosphere . " However , the club does open the entire stadium for international friendly matches , and some league matches . The team 's original business plan expected only 12 @,@ 000 tickets per game . Based on high initial demand , capacity for the stadium was limited to 24 @,@ 500 for the beginning of the inaugural 2009 season . However , due to continued high demand , capacity has been increased multiple times , to 38 @,@ 500 for the 2012 season and to 39 @,@ 115 for 2015 season . On October 7 , 2012 , a record was established when a crowd of 66 @,@ 452 attended a Sounders 3 @-@ 0 win over the rival Portland Timbers : the second @-@ highest to @-@ date in MLS . The Sounders then beat their own record on August 25 , 2013 again against the Timbers with 67 @,@ 385 in attendance for Clint Dempsey 's home debut , a 1 @-@ 0 win for the Sounders . 
 While the Sounders currently play on FieldTurf , CenturyLink Field has previously had temporary natural grass installed for international soccer events . In 2012 , an updated FieldTurf surface was installed and certified by FIFA with a 2 @-@ star quality rating , the highest possible rating . If an MLS rule change requires natural grass playing surfaces , the field will be permanently replaced with natural grass . 
 The team 's training facilities and offices are located at the Starfire Sports Complex in nearby Tukwila . Smaller than CenturyLink Field , Starfire is also used to host U.S. Open Cup matches . Sounders representatives have said they prefer the more intimate atmosphere for smaller cup matches .

 The Sounders FC Alliance was established at the request of minority owner Drew Carey . Based on the fan association at FC Barcelona , members of the Alliance have the ability to vote on the removal of the General Manager and on other team decisions . Season ticket holders become automatic members , while non @-@ season ticket holders may buy into the Alliance for a fee . Membership benefits include voting privileges , an invitation to the annual meeting and other team perks . Members may also be elected to the Sounders FC Alliance Council by receiving at least 25 nominations from other members on an annual basis . The first vote on retaining or replacing Sounders General Manager Adrian Hanauer was scheduled to be held between October to December 2012 . After 13 @,@ 775 votes registered , Hanauer was retained by the Alliance . Drew Carey is the chairman of the Sounders FC Alliance . 
 Carey also requested that the Sounders have their own marching band , the first of its kind in MLS . This led to the creation of the Sound Wave , a 53 @-@ member marching band consisting of brass and marching percussion . The band plays music from multiple genres , such as Latin , rock and pop , and sits on the north end of CenturyLink Field . The March to the Match , in which fans march from Occidental Park to CenturyLink Field before each home match , has been accompanied by the Sound Wave . 
 Besides the Alliance , there are currently four recognized , independent supporters groups for the Sounders . Emerald City Supporters ( ECS ) , which formed in 2005 to support the USL Sounders , is the largest supporter group and sits in the south end of the stadium in sections 121 – 123 . Eastside Supporters is a group which can be found in section 150 which they call " The Pod " . Gorilla FC is a Sounders supporters group that sits in the south end of CenturyLink Field in Sections 119 and 120 . The North End Faithful sit in the north end of the stadium beneath the " Hawks Nest " in sections 100 and 144 – 152 .

 Although there is no official rivalry between the Sounders and Los Angeles Galaxy , the two teams have met several times in the MLS Cup Playoffs . The relationship between head coaches Bruce Arena and Sigi Schmid , the two most successful in league history , also plays a factor in the clubs ' rivalry .

 = Me and Juliet = 
 Me and Juliet is a musical comedy by Richard Rodgers ( music ) and Oscar Hammerstein II ( lyrics and book ) and their sixth stage collaboration . The work tells a story of romance backstage at a long @-@ running musical : assistant stage manager Larry woos chorus girl Jeanie behind the back of her electrician boyfriend , Bob . Me and Juliet premiered in 1953 and was not considered a success , although it ran for much of a year on Broadway and returned a small profit to its backers . The show received no Tony Award nominations . 
 Rodgers had long wanted to write a musical comedy about the cast and crew backstage at a theatre . After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another hit with The King and I , Rodgers proposed the backstage project to his partner . Hammerstein was unenthusiastic , thinking the subject matter trivial , but agreed to do the project . The play required complex machinery , designed by Jo Mielziner , so that the audience could view action not only on the stage of the theatre where the show @-@ within @-@ the @-@ show ( also named Me and Juliet ) takes place , but in the wings and on the light bridge ( high above the stage , from which the lighting technicians train spotlights ) as well . 
 When Me and Juliet began tryout performances in Cleveland , the duo realized that the show had problems with the plot and staging . Extensive revisions during the remaining Cleveland and Boston tryouts failed to cure the difficulties with the plot , which the critics considered weak and uninteresting . The show was met with less than favorable reviews , though Mielziner 's staging won praise from audience and critics . The show closed once it had exhausted its advance sales . With the exception of a short run in Chicago , there was no national tour , and the show is almost never seen — although a small @-@ scale production was presented by London 's <unk> Theatre in 2010 . 
 = = Inception = = 
 The origins of Me and Juliet can be traced to the early days of the relationship between Rodgers and Hammerstein . The musical Oklahoma ! opened in 1943 ; it was Rodgers and Hammerstein 's first work together and a massive hit . Soon after Oklahoma ! opened , Rodgers began considering the idea of a musical set backstage at a theatre staging a musical . The production could explore different areas of the backstage world . Rodgers also saw it as the opportunity to write a pure musical comedy , without the serious themes which had marked their early works — such as the attacks on racism in South Pacific , and the cultural tolerance in The King and I. 
 Hammerstein was initially unenthusiastic , thinking the subject matter trivial , but Rodgers pressed the matter . It was Hammerstein 's turn to give in to his partner ; Rodgers had agreed to the project that became the 1947 musical , Allegro , their initial failure , under pressure from Hammerstein , who had long dreamed of doing a serious musical about an ordinary man . According to Stephen Sondheim , a protégé of Hammerstein , " Oscar was able to keep the partnership together by taking Dick 's suggestion [ for a backstage musical ] , which he did not want to take . " As the two discussed the backstage idea , Hammerstein became more enthusiastic , suggesting that the show start with the stage entirely bare , as if the audience had come in not at performance time but at another time during the day . Such effects are today well @-@ known following the success of other " <unk> " such as A Chorus Line ; in the early 1950s they were unrealized and novel . 
 The two discussed the matter at a meeting in Palm Beach , Florida , in early 1952 , where Rodgers was vacationing as he worked on melodic sketches for the television program Victory at Sea . Rodgers suggested dispensing with the overture , reserving that for the overture of the show @-@ within @-@ the @-@ show . Following another meeting in mid @-@ 1952 , they called in long @-@ time Rodgers and Hammerstein stage designer Jo Mielziner and hired him to design the sets . Mielziner confirmed that a scene could be played part onstage and part in the backstage world , but that this would be expensive . In August 1952 , Hammerstein began a sketch of the plot ; by early October he had a near @-@ complete first draft . As the show was to be musical comedy , the pair hired one of the top musical comedy directors , George Abbott , who accepted the position without reading the script . He regretted the haste of this decision as soon as he read the script , finding it sentimental and melodramatic . He confided his concerns to the pair ; in response , Hammerstein told him to make whatever changes in the script he thought best . With Hammerstein 's permission , Abbott made major changes to the plot . 
 Hammerstein had only briefly described the show @-@ within @-@ the @-@ show . Fearing the show would be uninteresting , Abbott hoped that some highlights would be furnished when the show @-@ within @-@ the @-@ show , as yet only briefly described by Hammerstein , was fleshed out . According to author and composer Ethan Mordden in his book about the duo 's works , Hammerstein thought the show @-@ within @-@ the @-@ show was to be : 
 something bizarre , to stand out and amaze us , the better to set off the plain life of the actor ... We shall imagine some rather advanced musical of the near future , something beyond even Allegro , with archetypical characters — a simple hero and his lovable Juliet , the rapacious Don Juan and his volatile Carmen . Then the audience will always know where it is . Contrast is the key . The show @-@ within must look and sound , at every moment , as far from real life as possible . 
 Hammerstein included an incident he had seen when he was a neophyte assistant stage manager : a chorus boy came up to a chorus girl and asked to use some of her mascara — to disguise a hole in the boy 's black socks . Hammerstein stated , " we were religious in keeping away from the trite things — the kindly old stage door man named Pop , the pretty little understudy who replaces the star on opening night . We steered clear , too , of the backstage story of a company putting on a new show , with all the anxieties of the actors and producers ... It seemed right to focus on a show which is already running because we wanted to tell a story about a community , the backstage community , and this community becomes settled and established after a show opens . " 
 In addition to Abbott , the duo recruited other professionals experienced in musical comedy . Choreographer Robert Alton had worked in such hits as Panama Hattie and in movie musicals . Don Walker was hired to do the orchestrations ; his would be simpler than those of Robert Russell Bennett , who usually performed that function in the pair 's musicals but who was not available . Irene Sharaff was engaged to design the more than 300 costumes which would be needed . The show was originally named Hercules and Juliet , but they soon changed it to Me and Juliet . The Majestic Theatre , which Rodgers and Hammerstein desired to have for Me and Juliet , was currently occupied by their South Pacific , four years into its run . Arrangements were made to shift South Pacific to the Broadway Theatre , though due to schedule conflicts , this meant moving that show to Boston for five weeks .

 For theatrical terminology , see Stage ( theatre ) . 
 The entire action of the show takes place in and close to a Broadway theatre in which the long @-@ running musical " Me and Juliet " ( the " show @-@ within @-@ the @-@ show " ) is playing . The setting is the early 1950s . 
 = = = Act 1 = = = 
 A half @-@ hour remains before the show is to begin . Electrician Sidney and chorus girl Jeanie are irritated at Sidney 's fellow electrician , Bob , for not being there . Sidney needs Bob 's help ; Jeanie , Bob 's girlfriend , is annoyed at being stood up . Sidney warns Jeanie that Bob may not be the right man for her ; these are doubts she has too ( Musical numbers : " A Very Special Day " / " That 's the Way it Happens " ) . 
 Jeanie leaves , and Bob appears . Bob tells Sidney he likes dating Jeanie , but does not plan to marry her . When Sidney jokes that Jeanie can do better than Bob , the larger man momentarily chokes him . Jeanie sees this , adding to her doubts about Bob . Larry , the assistant stage manager , is also attracted to Jeanie ( reprise of " That 's the Way it Happens " ) . 
 Stage manager Mac sees to the final preparations , and the overture to the internal show is played by the orchestra , led by Dario , the conductor ( " Overture to Me and Juliet " ) . The internal show 's curtain rises ( " Marriage Type Love " ) : the main male character , " Me " ( performed by Charlie , a singer ) , tells the audience about the girl he wants to marry , Juliet ( Lily , a singer ) . He also tells the audience of the girl he is determined not to marry , Carmen , who scares him . " Me " feels Carmen ( the lead female dancing role ) is better suited to his boss , Don Juan ( the lead male dancer ) . As the internal show continues , Bob and Sidney are on the light bridge . Bob identifies with Don Juan for his reluctance to marry ( " Keep It Gay " ) . 
 Another day at Me and Juliet , and the dancers are practicing under Mac 's supervision ( conclusion of " Keep It Gay " ) . At Larry 's urging , Jeanie decides to audition for the position of second understudy for the role of Juliet . On learning this , Mac takes Larry aside and warns him never to get involved with a cast member of a show while in charge of it . No sooner has Mac said this than his girlfriend Betty ( currently in the show across the street ) auditions for the role of Carmen . The producer gives her the role . As Larry looks on with amusement , Mac accepts this professionally , then stamps off in disgust . 
 Jeanie practices for her own audition ( " No Other Love " ) , and Larry tells her that the audience will accept her if she 's " a real kid " like Juliet , but reject her if she 's a " phony " ( " The Big Black Giant " ) . Larry desires a romance with Jeannie , but fears the larger and stronger Bob . 
 Several months pass , during which Jeanie gets the job as second understudy . Larry and Jeanie are meeting secretly and keeping their budding romance from Bob . The rest of the cast is aware of their dates — one dancer spotted them in a chili restaurant on Eighth Avenue . 
 Mac , true to his principles , has dumped Betty , but the two are still attracted to each other . Betty enjoys acting ( " It 's Me " ) . As she performs in the internal show , Bob and Sidney are on the light bridge again . 
 Bob has been fooled by Jeanie 's lies about why they are not going out , and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other . Bob demands proof , and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the upcoming Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet . Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers , an action caught by Bob 's spotlight . Mac enters , grasps the situation , sends Larry away , then puts the tray back in Jeanie 's hands and pushes her onstage . She is pursued by Bob 's spotlight , which relentlessly follows her around the stage as more and more of the dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong . Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge ; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground . Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic . 
 = = = Act 2 = = = 
 In the downstairs lounge , a few minutes before the Act 2 curtain for Me and Juliet rises , the ushers comment on the remarkable conclusion to Act 1 — although the audience has noticed nothing unusual ( " Intermission Talk " ) . As Act 2 of the internal show starts , an enraged Bob is searching the theatre for Jeannie and Larry . Unable to find them , he takes up position at a bar across the street where he can watch the theatre doors ( " It Feels Good " ) . The perspective shifts to the onstage action in Me and Juliet , where Don Juan and Carmen are on a date ( " We Deserve Each Other " ) , before moving to the manager 's office where Larry and Jeanie are hiding out ( " I 'm Your Girl " ) . Mac has only just begun his lecture to them when Bob enters through the window , having heard familiar voices . In the ensuing fight , Bob knocks out Mac , but when the electrician grabs for Jeannie , Larry strongly defends her . The fight ends when Bob accidentally hits his head on a radiator and is knocked out as well . 
 Ruby , the company manager , sends Larry and Jeannie down to the stage to continue the play . After Bob and Mac recover , Ruby informs Bob that Larry and Jeanie had secretly married earlier that day , and , surprised , the electrician leaves . Mac , fearful of more mayhem , goes in search of him . As Mac exits , the phone rings , and Ruby takes the call . It is the producer , calling for Mac to transfer him to another show , thereby setting him free to resume his romance with Betty . 
 Onstage , Me and Juliet is concluding . After the internal show finishes ( " Finale to Me and Juliet " ) , Larry , who will be the new stage manager , insists on rehearsing a scene from the show . Seeing Bob enter with a scowl , Larry orders him and Sidney to be present the next morning to re @-@ angle the lights . Taken aback , and rather sheepishly , Bob says " I didn 't know you were married " before quietly leaving , after stating , " I 'll be here , I guess . " Jeanie is congratulated by her <unk> , but Larry , all business , waves them to their places to rehearse the scene . As Lily has had to leave , Jeanie stands in for her as Juliet , while Larry sings the part of Me in the scene , as the curtain falls ( " Finale of Our Play " ) . 
 = = Rehearsals and tryouts = = 
 The cast consisted mostly of unknowns , though Isabel Bigley , who had just originated Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls , was given the leading role of chorus girl Jeanie . For Larry , the assistant stage manager who falls in love with Jeanie , they cast Bill Hayes , a well @-@ known stage and television actor . William <unk> , the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part of Larry , but lost out because he was thought to be too tall to be afraid of Mark Dawson , hired as the towering bully Bob . 
 Chorus auditions began March 10 , 1953 , at Broadway 's Majestic Theatre ; Rodgers , Hammerstein , and Abbott listened to more than 1 @,@ 000 people . Rehearsals opened at the Majestic for principals and the Alvin Theatre for dancers . According to Saul Pett , a freelance reporter who was allowed to observe the rehearsals , " everyone seems relaxed except Hammerstein . " The lyricist 's son James served as second assistant stage manager . James Hammerstein remembered having a difficult relationship with Rodgers ; the composer suggested James do his work from front of house , rather than from backstage . " I think he thought it was his show and his bailiwick . Why should a Hammerstein be back there ? " James Hammerstein found the lead female dancer attractive , and asked her out . Just before the date , Rodgers fired her , telling James Hammerstein to break the news . 
 Pett recorded the technical problems which had to be solved to accomplish the complex staging : 
 A number of key scenes required the audience to both see the play @-@ within @-@ the @-@ play and at the same time observe the realism of the stage manager 's operations in the wings . To achieve this result and to make both elements simultaneous , the major part of the production had to hang on specially @-@ constructed overhead steel tracks . Synchronized electric motors slowly moved the stage pictures off into the wings far enough to expose the stage manager 's desk and actors and stagehands offstage awaiting their cues . 
 During the rehearsals , the duo took out two production numbers , " Wake Up , Little Theatre " and " Dance " , concerned that the show was running long . The actress playing Juliet in the internal play proved to be a fine singer but a poor actress ; she was replaced by Helena Scott . Abbott had few negative comments after the final New York run @-@ through , and the company entrained for Cleveland , where the first tryouts were to be , in high spirits , sleeping little on the train ride . RCA Records put up the $ 350 @,@ 000 cost of the production in exchange for a fifty @-@ percent interest and rights to the original cast recording . 
 The tryouts in Cleveland were at the Hanna Theatre . The dress rehearsal the night before the initial performance revealed a number of problems with the show ; during the first act alone , Hammerstein dictated eight pages of notes . The sandbag which falls from the light bridge near the end of Act 1 dropped off @-@ cue , nearly striking Isabel Bigley , who played Jeanie . Pett remembered that the rehearsal was stopped often , as Rodgers sought to work out each problem as it arose , and the rehearsal , which began at 8 p.m. did not end until 2 a.m. 
 The Cleveland premiere on the evening of April 20 , 1953 , saw a distinguished crowd turn out . When the stage backdrop failed to come down on time , Hammerstein was heard to mutter , " Damn and damn and damn ! This is a new way : they saved it for the performance ! " Nevertheless , the crowd gave the show a rousing welcome . The Cleveland critics thought well of the show , but were concerned about the weak story . After the Cleveland reactions and problems , according to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest , " what had seemed to be a show needing minor adjustments became a musical in serious trouble " . Bigley remembered that she had just come from a hit and " there just wasn 't the same energy " . Hammerstein had intended to omit the overture , with the audience to watch , after the curtain rose , a blank stage on which the play @-@ within @-@ the @-@ play performers and crew drifted in and began their preparations . Expecting the orchestra to begin the evening , the audience talked throughout the initial scenes before being quieted by the internal show 's overture ; in response , the duo abandoned Hammerstein 's concept and opened with an overture . 
 In contrast to the levity on their first train ride , the company was downcast and exhausted en route from Cleveland to Boston for the final tryouts . The show opened in Boston on May 6 . A majority of the Boston critics liked the show , and expressed confidence that Rodgers and Hammerstein could fix the problems with the plot . The pair took out one song , " Meat and Potatoes " , which was felt to be too raunchy . After watching it performed by Joan McCracken , who played Betty ( Carmen in the play @-@ within @-@ the @-@ play ) , the pair decided it had too many double entendres and cut it . It was replaced by " We Deserve Each Other " , which the pair had written in a Cleveland hotel room . Another cut song , " You Never Had It So Good " , included lyrics which satirized the duo 's own earlier efforts . Its lyrics , " I 'll sew , I 'll bake / I 'll try to make your evenings all enchanted . / My <unk> , / I 'm yours to take , but don 't take me for granted " , alluded to two songs from South Pacific , " Some Enchanted Evening " and " Honey Bun " . Audiences continued to greet the show warmly . 
 During the Boston previews , the duo heard the audience praise the sets , a reaction which usually <unk> ill for the show itself . Hammerstein wrote to The King and I director John van Druten : 
 Me and Juliet looks like a great big hit . It is a change of pace for us and in some quarters we may be criticized because it is not as high @-@ <unk> ' as our most recent efforts . It is in fact an out and out musical comedy . If this be treason , make the most of it .

 The musical opened on Broadway on May 28 , 1953 at the Majestic Theatre . Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run ; by the start of November , it had paid back its advance , and closed after 358 performances , paying a small profit to RCA . Thomas Hischak , in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia , suggests that business fell off after the advance was exhausted " because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical " . According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo 's works , " despite a $ 500 @,@ 000 advance sale , despite a ten @-@ month run ( which , for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein , would have represented a major success ) , and despite an eventual profit in excess of $ 100 @,@ 000 , Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure " . 
 The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast . McCracken , who played Betty , was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run . Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon . The baby was in fact aborted , because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken 's health as a result of her diabetes . Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry , he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley , who was supposedly his love interest and wife : " I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love . " The show received no Tony Award nominations . During the run , Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book . Upon his return , Hammerstein 's secretary asked him how the show was going . The lyricist thought for a second , then said only " I hate that show . " 
 No national tour was attempted , but the show did have a six @-@ week run in Chicago in 1954 . Among those who played in the chorus during the New York run was future star Shirley MacLaine ; Shirley Jones was a chorus girl in the Chicago performances . Subsequent productions include one by Kansas City 's Starlight Theatre in 1955 . Equity Library Theatre produced it in New York in 1970 ; it returned to that city , though not to Broadway , in 2002 with the York Theatre . A London production was presented by the <unk> Theatre in 2010 in a fifty @-@ seat theatre ; the production was billed as the show 's European premiere .

 One source of Rodgers 's excitement for the concept that became Me and Juliet was his view that a contemporary musical gave him the opportunity for a contemporary score . At the time Rodgers wrote the score , a Latin dance craze had swept the United States , and its influence found its way into the music for Me and Juliet . Rodgers put an onstage jazz trio in the production and encouraged the members to improvise . Among the trio was jazz artist Barbara Carroll as Chris , rehearsal pianist . " Intermission Talk " , the chatter among audience members early in the second act , is given a bouncy melody and sly references to a number of shows then on Broadway — including the duo 's own The King and I. According to author and composer Ethan Mordden , Rodgers 's score " found [ Rodgers & Hammerstein ] going for impish , nimble , the sound of the Hit Parade as reimagined by [ them ] " . 
 Rodgers borrowed the music for " No Other Love " from his award @-@ winning score for Victory at Sea . RCA , which had those rights , arranged for Perry Como to record the song , and it was rushed onto the market to coincide with the show 's Broadway opening . The record became a number @-@ one hit for Como on the Disc Jockey chart , though # 2 as a best seller , remaining on the charts for 22 weeks . 
 Hischak described the original cast album as " surprisingly lively and mostly enjoyable for a musical that was considered so dull on stage . " He pointed to " Intermission Talk " as a number which probably works better in a recording than on stage and states that " there is no mistaking the hypnotic power of ' No Other Love ' " . The original cast recording was released on compact disc in 1993 .

 Critics ' views were neutral to unfavorable . The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson praised the acting and choreography , but stated , " This is their Valentine to show business , expressed in the form of a show @-@ within @-@ a @-@ show ; and it has just about everything except an intelligible story . " Herald @-@ Tribune critic Walter Kerr noted that " Rodgers and Hammerstein have come perilously close to writing a show @-@ without @-@ a @-@ show . " George Jean Nathan of the Journal American stated that " Hammerstein 's book has the effect of hanging idly around waiting for an idea to come to him . " Robert Coleman of the Daily Mirror noted , " Having set new high standards for musicals throughout the world , Rodgers and Hammerstein dipped into the lower drawer of their desk for Me and Juliet . It proved a big disappointment for this dyed @-@ in @-@ the @-@ wool R. & H. fan . " John Chapman of the Daily News commented , " It is at its most interesting when Jo Mielziner 's sets are in motion " . According to Steven Suskin in his compilation of Broadway opening night reviews , the seven major New York critics allotted the production no raves , one favorable review , one mixed , four unfavorable , and one pan . 
 One well @-@ received number was " Keep It Gay " , a song which in rehearsal had been assigned to several different performers before ending with Bob . The song was liked in part due to the novelty of its setting : it begins with Bob singing from the light bridge high above the stage ; following a blackout the internal play performers take it up on the stage below , and following another blackout , the performers are seen in their workout clothes , at a rehearsal some weeks later . Hammerstein gave credit for the scene to Mielziner , and suggested that it demonstrated one way in which the book had affected the music . 
 Abbott stated that there were two reasons for what he considered to be the show 's failure . The first was Rodgers and Hammerstein 's overconfidence ; they thought of themselves as Broadway 's " Golden Boys " who could do no wrong . The other was the play @-@ within @-@ the @-@ play , which had not been thoroughly thought out by anyone . According to Abbott , Hammerstein remained " positively Sphinx @-@ like " on the subject . At a loss to understand the characters of the play @-@ within @-@ the play , Alton came up with nothing more than routine song @-@ and @-@ dance numbers . During the run , the duo approached choreographer Jerome Robbins and asked him if he could fix the dances . Robbins said that he could , but he would not , as " it would kill Bob Alton " . According to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin , " [ the ] intended contrast between onstage and backstage life was never achieved because the onstage show was so tepid and confusing . " 
 " That 's the Way it Happens " was included in the 1996 stage version of Rodgers and Hammerstein 's 1945 movie musical , State Fair . According to David Lewis in his history of the Broadway musical , " The Rodgers and Hammerstein office has , it would appear , given up on [ later R & H musical ] Pipe Dream and [ Me and ] Juliet ever finding an audience ... so these songs are up for grabs . " 
 Composer and author Ethan Mordden , in his book on the duo 's works , wrote of the conceptual difficulties which Rodgers and Hammerstein had with the musical : 
 [ Me and Juliet ] was the first of their plays without a powerful sense of destiny , of characters consequentially interconnected . In Oklahoma ! , Carousel , South Pacific and The King and I especially , the principals — whether noble or weak , just or impetuous — change each other 's lives . Me and Juliet 's characters appear to be thrown together by chance and — except for the lovers — will part company unaffected by each other as soon as the show closes . This left Hammerstein with nothing to seek out in his people , and Rodgers with nothing to illustrate .

 Thelma Catherine " Pat " Nixon ( née Ryan ; March 16 , 1912 – June 22 , 1993 ) was the wife of Richard Nixon , 37th President of the United States , and First Lady of the United States from 1969 to 1974 . 
 Born in Ely , Nevada , she grew up with her two brothers in what is now Cerritos , California , graduating from high school in 1929 . She attended Fullerton Junior College and later the University of Southern California . She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs , including pharmacy manager , typist , <unk> , and retail clerk . In 1940 , she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters . Nixon campaigned for her husband in his successful congressional campaigns of 1946 and 1948 . Richard Nixon was elected Vice President in the Eisenhower administration , whereupon Pat undertook many missions of goodwill with her husband and gained favorable media coverage . She assisted her husband in both his unsuccessful 1960 presidential campaign and later in his successful 1968 presidential campaign . 
 As First Lady , Pat Nixon promoted a number of charitable causes , including volunteerism . She oversaw the collection of more than 600 pieces of historic art and furnishings for the White House , an acquisition larger than that of any other administration . She was the most traveled First Lady in U.S. history , a record unsurpassed until twenty @-@ five years later . She accompanied the President as the first First Lady to visit China and the Soviet Union and her solo trips to Africa and South America gained her recognition as " Madame Ambassador " ; she was the first First Lady to enter a combat zone as well . These trips gained her favorable reception in the media and the host countries . Her tenure ended when , after being re @-@ elected in a landslide victory in 1972 , President Nixon resigned two years later amid the Watergate scandal . 
 Her public appearances became increasingly rare later in life . She and her husband returned to California , and later moved to New Jersey . She suffered two strokes , one in 1976 and another in 1983 , then was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1992 . She died in 1993 , aged 81 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Thelma Catherine Ryan was born in the small mining town of Ely , Nevada , the day before Saint Patrick 's Day . Her father , William M. Ryan Sr. , was a sailor , gold miner , and truck farmer of Irish descent ; her mother , Katherine Halberstadt , was a German immigrant . " Pat " was a nickname given to her by her father , referring to her birthdate and Irish ancestry . Upon enrolling in college in 1931 she dropped her first name of Thelma , replacing it with Pat and occasionally rendering it as Patricia ; the name change , however , was not a legal action , merely one of preference . 
 After her birth , the Ryan family moved to California , and in 1914 settled on a small truck farm in Artesia ( present @-@ day Cerritos ) . Thelma Ryan 's high @-@ school yearbook page gives her nickname as " Buddy " and her ambition to run a boarding house . 
 During this time she worked on the family farm , and also at a local bank as a janitor and bookkeeper . Her mother died of cancer in 1924 . Pat , who was 12 at the time , assumed all the household duties for her father , who died in 1929 of silicosis , and two older brothers , William Jr . ( 1910 – 1997 ) and Thomas ( 1911 – 1992 ) . She also had a half @-@ sister , Neva Bender ( born 1909 ) , and a half @-@ brother , Matthew Bender ( born 1907 ) , from her mother 's first marriage ; her mother 's first husband had died during a flash flood in South Dakota . 
 = = Education and career = = 
 It has been said that few , if any , First Ladies worked as consistently before their marriage as did Pat Nixon . As she told the writer Gloria Steinem during the 1968 presidential campaign , " I never had time to think about things like that — who I wanted to be , or who I admired , or to have ideas . I never had time to dream about being anyone else . I had to work . " 
 After graduating from Excelsior High School in 1929 , she attended Fullerton Junior College . She paid for her education by working odd jobs , including as a driver , a pharmacy manager , a telephone operator , and a typist . She also earned money sweeping the floors of a local bank , and from 1930 until 1932 , she lived in New York City , working as a secretary and <unk> . 
 Determined " to make something out of myself " , she enrolled in 1931 at the University of Southern California ( USC ) , where she majored in merchandising . A former professor noted that she " stood out from the empty @-@ headed , overdressed little sorority girls of that era like a good piece of literature on a shelf of cheap paperbacks . " She held part @-@ time jobs on campus , worked as a sales clerk in Bullock 's @-@ Wilshire department store , taught typing and shorthand at a high school , and supplemented her income by working as an extra in the film industry . She appeared as part of a brief walk @-@ on in the 1935 film Becky Sharp , as well as the 1936 film The Great Ziegfeld . 
 In 1937 , Pat Ryan graduated cum laude from USC with a Bachelor of Science degree in merchandising , together with a certificate to teach at the high school level , which USC deemed equivalent to a Master 's degree . Pat accepted a position as a high school teacher in Whittier , California . 
 = = Marriage and family , early campaigns = = 
 While in Whittier , Pat Ryan met a young lawyer recently graduated from the Duke University School of Law , Richard Milhous Nixon . The two became acquainted at a Little Theater group when they were cast together in The Dark Tower . Known as Dick , he asked Pat Ryan to marry him the first night they went out . " I thought he was nuts or something ! " she recalled . He courted the redhead he called his " wild Irish Gypsy " for two years , even driving her to and from her dates with other men . 
 Eventually they married at the Mission Inn in Riverside , California , on June 21 , 1940 . She said that she had been attracted to the young Nixon because he " was going places , he was vital and ambitious ... he was always doing things " . Later , referring to Richard Nixon , she said , " Oh but you just don 't realize how much fun he is ! He 's just so much fun ! " Following a brief honeymoon in Mexico , the two lived in a small apartment in Whittier . As U.S. involvement in World War II began , the couple moved to Washington , D.C. , with Richard taking a position as a lawyer for the Office of Price Administration ( OPA ) ; Pat worked as a secretary for the American Red Cross , but also qualified as a price analyst for the OPA . He then joined the United States Navy , and while he was stationed in San Francisco , she resumed work for the OPA as an economic analyst . 
 Veteran UPI reporter Helen Thomas suggested that in public , the Nixons " moved through life ritualistically " , but privately , however , they were " very close " . In private , Richard Nixon was described as being " unabashedly sentimental " , often praising Pat for her work , remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts . During state dinners , he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first . Pat , in turn , felt that her husband was vulnerable and sought to protect him . Of his critics , she said that " Lincoln had worse critics . He was big enough not to let it bother him . That 's the way my husband is . " 
 Pat campaigned at her husband 's side in 1946 when he entered politics , running successfully for a seat in the United States House of Representatives . That same year , she gave birth to a daughter and namesake , Patricia , known as Tricia . In 1948 , Pat had her second and last child , Julie . When asked about her husband 's career , Pat once stated , " The only thing I could do was help him , but [ politics ] was not a life I would have chosen . " Pat participated in the campaign by doing research on his opponent , incumbent Jerry Voorhis . She also wrote and distributed campaign literature . Nixon was elected in his first campaign to represent California 's 12th congressional district . During the next six years , Pat saw her husband move from the U.S. House of Representatives to the United States Senate , and then be nominated as Dwight D. Eisenhower 's vice presidential candidate . 
 Although Pat Nixon was a Methodist , she and her husband attended whichever Protestant Church was nearest to their home , especially after moving to Washington . They attended the Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Church because it sponsored her daughters ' Brownie troop , occasional Baptist services with the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham , and Norman Vincent Peale 's Marble Collegiate Church . 
 = = Wife of the Vice President , 1953 – 1961 = = 
 During the Presidential campaign of 1952 , Pat Nixon 's attitude toward politics changed when her husband was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions . Pat encouraged him to fight the charges , and he did so by delivering the famed " Checkers speech " , so @-@ called for the family 's dog , a Cocker Spaniel given to them by a political supporter . This was Pat 's first national television appearance , and she , her daughters , and the dog were featured prominently . Defending himself as a man of the people , Nixon stressed his wife 's abilities as a stenographer , then said , " I should say this , that Pat doesn 't have a mink coat . But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat , and I always tell her she would look good in anything . " 
 Pat Nixon accompanied her husband abroad in his vice presidential years . She visited 53 nations , often bypassing luncheons and teas and instead visiting hospitals , orphanages , and even a leper colony in Panama . On a trip to Venezuela , the Nixons ' limousine was pelted with rocks and the couple was spat upon as representatives of the U.S. government . 
 A November 1 , 1958 , article in The Seattle Times was typical of the media 's favorable coverage of the future First Lady , stating that " Mrs. Nixon is always reported to be gracious and friendly . And she sure is friendly . She greets a stranger as a friend . She doesn 't just shake hands but clasps a visitor 's hand in both her hands . Her manner is direct ... Mrs. Nixon also upheld her reputation of always looking neat , no matter how long her day has been . " A year and a half later , during her husband 's campaign for the presidency , The New York Times called her " a paragon of wifely virtues " whose " efficiency makes other women feel slothful and untalented " . 
 Pat Nixon was named Outstanding Homemaker of the Year ( 1953 ) , Mother of the Year ( 1955 ) , and the Nation 's Ideal Housewife ( 1957 ) , and once admitted that she pressed all of her husband 's suits one evening . " Of course , I didn 't have to , " she told The New York Times , " But when I don 't have work to do , I just think up some new project . " 
 = = Her husband 's campaigns — 1960 , 1962 and 1968 = = 
 Vice President Nixon ran for President of the United States in the 1960 election against Senator John F. Kennedy . Pat was featured prominently in the campaign ; an entire advertisement campaign was built around the slogan " Pat for First Lady " . Nixon conceded the election to Kennedy , although the race was very close and there were allegations of voter fraud . Pat had urged her husband to demand a recount of votes , though Nixon declined . Pat was most upset about the television cameras , which recorded her reaction when her husband lost — " millions of television viewers witnessed her desperate fight to hold a smile upon her lips as her face came apart and the bitter tears flowed from her eyes " , as one reporter put it . This permanently dimmed Pat Nixon 's view of politics . 
 In 1962 , the Nixons embarked on another campaign , this time for Governor of California . Prior to Richard Nixon 's announcement of his candidacy , Pat 's brother Tom Ryan said , " Pat told me that if Dick ran for governor she was going to take her shoe to him . " She eventually agreed to another run , citing that it meant a great deal to her husband , but Richard Nixon lost the gubernatorial election to Pat Brown . 
 Six years later , Richard Nixon ran again for the presidency . Pat was reluctant to face another campaign , her eighth since 1946 . Her husband was a deeply controversial figure in American politics , and Pat had witnessed and shared the praise and vilification he had received without having established an independent public identity for herself . Although she supported him in his career , she feared another " 1960 " , when Nixon lost to Kennedy . She consented , however , and participated in the campaign by traveling on campaign trips with her husband . Richard Nixon would make a political comeback with his presidential victory of 1968 over Vice @-@ President Hubert Humphrey — and the country would have a new First Lady .

 = = = Major initiatives = = = 
 Pat Nixon felt that the First Lady should always set a public example of high virtue as a symbol of dignity , but she refused to revel in the trappings of the position . When considering ideas for a project as First Lady , Pat refused to do ( or be ) something simply to emulate her predecessor , Lady Bird Johnson . She decided to continue what she called " personal diplomacy " , which meant traveling and visiting people in other states or other nations . 
 One of her major initiatives as First Lady was the promotion of volunteerism , in which she encouraged Americans to address social problems at the local level through volunteering at hospitals , civic organizations , and rehabilitation centers . She stated , " Our success as a nation depends on our willingness to give generously of ourselves for the welfare and enrichment of the lives of others . " She undertook a " Vest Pockets for Volunteerism " trip , where she visited ten different volunteer programs . Susan Porter , in charge of the First Lady 's scheduling , noted that Pat " saw volunteers as unsung heroes who hadn 't been encouraged or given credit for their sacrifices and who needed to be " . Her second volunteerism tour — she traveled 4 @,@ 130 miles ( 6 @,@ 647 km ) within the United States — helped to boost the notion that not all students were protesting the Vietnam War . She herself belonged to several volunteer groups , including Women in Community Services and Urban Services League , and was an advocate of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 , a bill that encouraged volunteerism by providing benefits to a number of volunteer organizations . Some reporters viewed her choice of volunteerism as safe and dull compared to the initiatives undertaken by Lady Bird Johnson and Jacqueline Kennedy . 
 Pat Nixon became involved in the development of recreation areas and parkland , was a member of the President 's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped , and lent her support to organizations dedicated to improving the lives of handicapped children . For her first Thanksgiving in the White House , Pat organized a meal for 225 senior citizens who did not have families . The following year , she invited wounded servicemen to a second annual Thanksgiving meal in the White House . Though presidents since George Washington had been issuing Thanksgiving proclamations , Pat became the only First Lady to issue one . 
 = = = Life in the White House = = = 
 After her husband was elected president in 1968 , Pat Nixon met with the outgoing First Lady Lady Bird Johnson and toured the private quarters of the White House on December 12 . Eventually she asked Sarah Jackson Doyle — an interior decorator who had worked for the Nixons since 1965 and who decorated the family 's 10 @-@ room apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York with French and English antiques — to serve as a design consultant . She hired Clement Conger from the State Department to be the Executive Mansion 's new <unk> replacing the house 's first curator , James Ketchum , who had been hired by Jacqueline Kennedy . To the White House residence staff , the Nixons were perceived as more stiff and formal than other first families , but nonetheless kind . Pat in particular liked the butlers and maids to be very quiet when they were around her . 
 Pat Nixon had an interest in adding artifacts to the Executive Mansion , and built on Jacqueline Kennedy 's more publicized efforts . She added more than 600 paintings and furnishings to the White House and its collections , the largest number of acquisitions by any administration . She created the Map Room and renovated the China room , and refurbished nine others . She worked with engineers to develop an exterior lighting system for the entire White House , literally making it glow a soft white . She ordered the flag flown , day and night , even when the president was not there . 
 She ordered pamphlets describing the rooms of the house for tourists so they could understand everything , and had them translated into Spanish , French , Italian and Russian for foreigners . She had ramps installed for the handicapped and physically disabled . She instructed the police who served as tour guides to attend sessions at the Winterthur Museum , Garden and Library ( to learn how tours were guided " in a real museum " ) , and arranged for them to wear less menacing uniforms , with their guns hidden underneath . The tour guides were to speak slowly to deaf groups , to help those who lip @-@ read , and Pat ordered that the blind be able to touch the antiques . 
 The First Lady had long been irritated with the perception that the White House and access to the President and First Lady were exclusively for the wealthy and famous ; she would routinely come down from the family quarters to greet tourists , shake hands , sign autographs , and pose for photos . Her daughter Julie Eisenhower reflected , " she invited so many groups to the White House to give them recognition , not famous ones , but little known organizations ... " 
 She invited former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and her children Caroline and John Jr. to dine with her family and view the White House 's official portraits of her and her husband , the late President Kennedy . It was the first time the three had returned to the White House since the president 's assassination eight years prior to the trip , which the First Lady ordered kept undisclosed to the media until after it had concluded . In doing so , she attempted to maintain privacy for the Kennedys . She also invited President Kennedy 's mother Rose Kennedy to see her son 's official portrait . 
 She opened the White House for evening tours so that the public could see the interior design work that had been implemented . Among these tours were those conducted in December , displaying the White House 's Christmas decor . In addition , she instituted a series of performances by artists at the White House in varied American traditions , from opera to bluegrass ; among the guests were The Carpenters in 1972 . These events were described as ranging from " creative to indifferent , to downright embarrassing " . When they entered the White House in 1969 , the Nixons began inviting families to non @-@ denominational Sunday church services in the East Room of the White House . She also oversaw the White House wedding of her daughter , Tricia , to Edward Ridley Finch Cox in 1971 . 
 She spoke out in favor of women running for political office and encouraged her husband to nominate a woman to the Supreme Court , saying " woman power is unbeatable ; I 've seen it all across this country " . She was the first of the American First Ladies to publicly support the Equal Rights Amendment , though her views on abortion were mixed . Following the Court 's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision , Pat stated she was pro @-@ choice . However , in 1972 , she said , " I 'm really not for abortion . I think it 's a personal thing . I mean abortion on demand — wholesale . " 
 In 1972 , she became the first Republican First Lady to address a national convention . Her efforts in the 1972 reelection campaign — traveling across the country and speaking on behalf of her husband — were copied by future candidates ' spouses . 
 = = = Travels = = = 
 Pat Nixon held the record as the most @-@ traveled First Lady before Hillary Rodham Clinton . In President Nixon 's first term , Pat traveled to 39 of 50 states , and in the first year alone , shook hands with a quarter of a million people . She undertook many missions of goodwill to foreign nations as well . Her first foreign trip took in Guam , India , the Philippines , Indonesia , Thailand , Pakistan , Romania , and England . On such trips , Pat refused to be serviced by an entourage , feeling that they were an unnecessary barrier and a burden for taxpayers . Soon after , during a trip to South Vietnam , Pat became the first First Lady to enter a combat zone . She had tea with the wife of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu in a palace , visited an orphanage , and lifted off in an open @-@ door helicopter — armed by military guards with machine guns — to witness U.S. troops fighting in a jungle below . She would later admit to experiencing a " moment of fear going into a battle zone " , because , as author and historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted , " Pat Nixon was literally in a line of fire . " She later visited an army hospital , where , for two hours , she walked through the wards and spoke with each wounded patient . The First Lady of South Vietnam , Madame Thieu , said Pat Nixon 's trip " intensified our morale " . 
 After hearing about the Great Peruvian earthquake of 1970 , which caused an avalanche and additional destruction , Pat initiated a " volunteer American relief drive " and flew to the country , where she aided in taking relief supplies to earthquake victims . She toured damaged regions and embraced homeless townspeople ; they trailed her as she climbed up hills of rubble and under fallen beams . Her trip was heralded in newspapers around the world for her acts of compassion and disregard for her personal safety or comfort , and her presence was a direct boost to political relations . One Peruvian official commented : " Her coming here meant more than anything else President Nixon could have done , " and an editorial in Peru 's Lima Prensa said that Peruvians could never forget Pat Nixon . Fran <unk> of the Associated Press wrote that no First Lady had ever undertaken a " mercy mission " resulting in such " diplomatic side effects " . On the trip , the Peruvian government presented her with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun , the highest Peruvian distinction and the oldest such honor in the Americas . 
 She became the first First Lady to visit Africa in 1972 , on a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ( 16 @,@ 093 km ) , eight @-@ day journey to Ghana , Liberia , and the Ivory Coast . Upon arrival to Liberia , Pat was honored with a 19 @-@ gun salute , a tribute reserved only for heads of government , and she reviewed troops . She later donned a traditional native costume and danced with locals . She was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Most Venerable Order of Knighthood , Liberia 's highest honor . In Ghana , she again danced with local residents , and addressed the nation 's Parliament . In the Ivory Coast , she was met by a quarter of a million people shouting " Vive Madame Nixon ! " She conferred with leaders of all three African nations . Upon her return home , White House staffer Charles Colson sent a memo to the President reading in part , " Mrs. Nixon has now broken through where we have failed ... People — men and women — identify with her , and in return with you . " 
 Another notable journey was the Nixons ' historic visit to the People 's Republic of China in 1972 . While President Nixon was in meetings , Pat toured through Peking in her red coat . According to Carl Sferrazza Anthony , China was Pat Nixon 's " moment " , her turning point as an acclaimed First Lady in the United States . She accompanied her husband to the Nixon – Brezhnev summit meetings in the Soviet Union later in the year . Though security constraints left her unable to walk freely through the streets as she did in China , Pat was still able to visit with children and walk arm @-@ in @-@ arm with Soviet First Lady Viktoria Brezhneva . Later , she visited Brazil and Venezuela in 1974 with the unique diplomatic standing of personal representative of the president . The Nixons ' last major trip was in June 1974 , to Austria , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Israel , and Jordan . 
 = = = Fashion and style = = = 
 The fashion press tends to take special interest in First Ladies . The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation 's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny , and the attention to Pat was lively . Women 's Wear Daily stated that Pat had a " good figure and good posture " , as well as " the best @-@ looking legs of any woman in public life today " . Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored , but nondescript , American @-@ made clothes . " I consider it my duty to use American designers " , she said , and favored them because , " they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they 're non <unk> " . She preferred to buy <unk> garments rather than made @-@ to @-@ order outfits . " I 'm a size 10 , " she told The New York Times . " I can just walk in and buy . I 've bought things in various stores in various cities . Only some of my clothes are by designers . " She did , however , wear the custom work of some well @-@ known talents , notably Geoffrey Beene , at the suggestion of Clara Treyz , her personal shopper . Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion . Nixon 's yellow @-@ satin inaugural gown by Harvey <unk> was criticized as " a schoolteacher on her night out " , but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying , " Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike . " 
 Nixon did not sport the outrageous fashions of the 1970s , because she was concerned about appearing conservatively dressed , especially as her husband 's political star rose . " Always before , it was sort of fun to get some ... thing that was completely different , high @-@ style " , she told a reporter . " But this is not appropriate now . I avoid the spectacular . " 
 = = = Watergate = = = 
 At the time the Watergate scandal broke to the media , Nixon " barely noticed " the reports of a break @-@ in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters . Later , when asked by the press about Watergate , she replied curtly , " I know only what I read in the newspapers . " In 1974 , when a reporter asked " Is the press the cause of the president 's problems ? " , she shot back , " What problems ? " Privately , she felt that the power of her husband 's staff was increasing , and President Nixon was becoming more removed from what was occurring in the administration . 
 Pat Nixon did not know of the secret tape recordings her husband had made . Julie Nixon Eisenhower stated that the First Lady would have ordered the tapes destroyed immediately , had she known of their existence . Once she did learn of the tapes , she vigorously opposed making them public , and compared them to " private love letters — for one person alone " . Believing in her husband 's innocence , she also encouraged him not to resign and instead fight all the impeachment charges that were eventually leveled against him . She said to her friend Helene Drown , " Dick has done so much for the country . Why is this happening ? " 
 After President Nixon told his family he would resign the office of the presidency , she replied , " But why ? " She contacted White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company , and began supervising the packing of the family 's personal belongings . On August 7 , 1974 , the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner . Pat sat on the edge of a couch and held her chin high , a sign of tension to her husband . When the president walked in , she threw her arms around him , kissed him , and said , " We 're all very proud of you , Daddy . " Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening , " Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling . " 
 The next morning , a televised 20 @-@ minute farewell speech to the White House staff took place in the East Room , during which the President read from Theodore Roosevelt 's biography and praised his own parents . The First Lady could hardly contain her tears ; she was most upset about the cameras , because they recorded her anguish , as they had during the 1960 election defeat . The Nixons walked onto the Executive Mansion 's South Lawn with Vice President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford to Marine One . As they walked , Pat , with one arm around her husband 's waist and one around Betty 's , said to Betty , " You 'll see many of these red carpets , and you 'll get so you hate ' em . " The helicopter carried them to Andrews Air Force Base ; from there they flew to California . 
 Pat Nixon later told her daughter Julie , " Watergate is the only crisis that ever got me down ... And I know I will never live to see the vindication . "

 Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted that ordinary citizens responded to Nixon . When a group of rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady , many were overcome with nervousness ; upon hearing their weeping , Pat hugged each individual tightly , and the tension dissipated . When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house because he could not see the washing machine , Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator , into the family quarters and the laundry room . She mixed well with people of different races , and made no distinctions on that basis . During the Nixons ' trip to China in 1972 , foreign minister Zhou En @-@ lai was <unk> smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China . 
 Pat Nixon was listed on the Gallup Organization 's top @-@ ten list of the most admired women fourteen times , from 1959 to 1962 and 1968 to 1979 . She was third in 1969 , and remained at number two until 1972 , when she was ranked number one as the most admired woman . She remained on the top @-@ ten list until 1979 , five years after her husband left office . To many , she was seen as an example of the " American Dream , " having risen from a poor background , with her greatest popularity among the " great silent majority " of voters . Mary Brooks , the director of the United States Mint , described the First Lady as " a good example to the women of this country – if they 're not part of those Women 's Liberation groups . " Additionally , it was the view of veteran UPI correspondent Helen Thomas that Pat " was the warmest First Lady I covered and the one who loved people the most . I think <unk> who covered her saw a woman who was sharp , responsive , sensitive . " 
 Press accounts framed Nixon as an embodiment of Cold War domesticity , in stark contrast to the second @-@ wave feminism of the time . Journalists often portrayed her as dutiful and selfless and seeing herself as a wife first and individual second . Time magazine described her as " the perfect wife and mother – pressing [ her husband 's ] pants , making dresses for daughters Tricia and Julie , doing her own housework even as the Vice President 's wife . " In the early years of her tenure as First Lady she was tagged ' Plastic Pat , ' the derogatory nickname applied because , according to critics , she was always smiling while her face rarely expressed emotion and her body language made her seem reserved , and at times , artificial . Some observers described Pat Nixon as " a paper doll , a Barbie doll – plastic , antiseptic , <unk> " and that she " has put every bit of the energy and drive of her youth into playing a role , and she may no longer recognize it as such " . 
 As for the criticisms , she said , " I am who I am and I will continue to be . " She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem : " Now , I have friends in all the countries of the world . I haven ’ t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do . Oh no , I ’ ve stayed interested in people . I ’ ve kept working . Right here in the plane I keep this case with me , and the minute I sit down , I write my thank you notes . Nobody gets by without a personal note . I don ’ t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with . I ’ ve never had it easy . I ’ m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy . " 
 Despite her largely demure public persona as a traditional wife and homemaker , Nixon was not as self @-@ effacing and timid as her critics often claimed . When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron , she firmly responded , " I think we 've had enough of this kitchen thing , don 't you ? " Some journalists , such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s ; Thompson wrote that she proved that " women can play a vital role in world affairs " while still retaining a " feminine manner . " Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique , and portrayed her as being out of step with her times . Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration 's policies , and , as a result , occasionally picketed her speaking events . After she had spoken to some of them , though , one student told the press that " she wanted to listen . I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing . I was surprised . " Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon .

 After returning to San Clemente , California , in 1974 and settling into the Nixons ' home , La Casa Pacifica , Pat Nixon rarely appeared in public and only granted occasional interviews to the press . In late May 1975 , Pat went to her girlhood town of Artesia to dedicate the Patricia Nixon Elementary School . In her remarks , she said , " I 'm proud to have the school carry my name . I always thought that only those who have gone had schools named after them . I am happy to tell you that I 'm not gone — I mean , not really gone . " It was Pat 's only solo public appearance in five and a half years in California . 
 Nixon suffered a stroke on July 7 , 1976 , at La Casa Pacifica , which resulted in the paralysis of her entire left side . Physical therapy enabled her to eventually regain all movement . She said that her recovery was " the hardest thing I have ever done physically " . In 1979 , she and her husband moved to a townhouse on East 65th Street in Manhattan , New York City . They lived there only briefly and in 1981 moved to a 6 @,@ 000 square feet ( 557 m2 ) house in Saddle River , New Jersey . This gave the couple additional space , and enabled them to be near their children and grandchildren . Pat , however , sustained another stroke in 1983 and two lung infections the following year . 
 In December 1987 , Richard Nixon wrote to Donald Trump about Pat Nixon believing that Trump had performed well on the The Phil Donahue Show , Nixon furthering that his wife was " an expert on politics " and that she had predicted Trump would do well when he decided to run for office . Decades later , Trump would enter and become the front @-@ runner in the Republican Party presidential primaries , 2016 . 
 Appearing " frail and slightly bent " , she appeared in public for the opening of the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace ( now Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum ) in Yorba Linda , California on July 19 , 1990 . The dedication ceremony included 50 @,@ 000 friends and well @-@ wishers , as well as former Presidents Ford , Reagan , and Bush and their wives . The library includes a Pat Nixon room , a Pat Nixon amphitheater , and rose gardens planted with the red @-@ black Pat Nixon Rose developed by a French company in 1972 , when she was first lady . Pat also attended the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley , California in November 1991 . Former First Lady Barbara Bush reflected , " I loved Pat Nixon , who was a sensational , gracious , and thoughtful First Lady " , and at the dedication of the Reagan Library , Bush remembered , " There was one sad thing . Pat Nixon did not look well at all . Through her smile you could see that she was in great pain and having a terrible time getting air into her lungs . " 
 The Nixons moved to a gated complex in Park Ridge , New Jersey in 1991 . Pat 's health was failing , and the house was smaller and contained an elevator . A heavy smoker most of her adult life who nevertheless never allowed herself to be seen with a cigarette in public , she eventually endured bouts of oral cancer , emphysema , and ultimately lung cancer , with which she was diagnosed in December 1992 while hospitalized with respiratory problems .

 Pat Nixon died at her Park Ridge , New Jersey home at 5 : 45 am on June 22 , 1993 , the day after her 53rd wedding anniversary . She was 81 . Her daughters and husband were by her side . 
 The funeral service for Pat Nixon took place in the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26 , 1993 . Speakers at the ceremony , including California Governor Pete Wilson , Kansas senator Bob Dole , and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham , eulogized the former First Lady . In addition to her husband and immediate family , former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives , Nancy and Betty , were also in attendance . Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke , and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either . President Nixon sobbed openly , profusely , and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony . It was a rare display of emotion from the former president , and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught . 
 Nixon 's tombstone gives her name as " Patricia Ryan Nixon " , the name by which she was popularly known . Former President Nixon survived her by 10 months , dying on April 22 , 1994 . Her epitaph reads :

 In 1994 , the Pat Nixon Park was established in Cerritos , California . The site where her girlhood home stood is on the property . The Cerritos City Council voted in April 1996 to erect a statue of the former first lady , one of the few statues created in the image of a first lady . 
 Pat has been portrayed by Joan Allen in the 1995 film Nixon , Patty McCormack in the 2008 film Frost / Nixon and Nicole Sullivan in the 2009 film Black Dynamite . She was sung by soprano <unk> Page in the 1987 opera Nixon in China world premiere in Houston , Texas , and later by Scottish soprano Janis Kelly in the 2011 Metropolitan Opera premiere in New York . 
 = Loveless ( album ) = 
 Loveless is the second studio album by Anglo @-@ Irish rock band My Bloody Valentine . Released on 4 November 1991 , the album was recorded over a two @-@ year period between 1989 and 1991 . The group cycled through nineteen studios and a larger number of engineers during the album 's two @-@ year creation , with total recording costs rumoured to have reached £ 250 @,@ 000 . Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the arduous recording process , intent on achieving a particular sound ; he experimented with guitar tremolo and tuning systems , unorthodox production techniques , obscured vocals , and sampled feedback and percussion . 
 While Loveless did not achieve great commercial success upon its release , it received enthusiastic reviews from critics , who praised its sonic innovations . Following the record 's release , My Bloody Valentine were removed from their record label Creation Records due to the difficulty and expense of working with Shields , a factor that was alleged to have contributed to the bankruptcy of the label . In the subsequent years , the group struggled to record a follow @-@ up album and would eventually break up in 1997 . Loveless would be their last full @-@ length release for over two decades . 
 Since its release , Loveless has been widely proclaimed as among the best albums of the 1990s by critics , as a landmark work of the shoegazing genre , and as an influence on various subsequent artists . The album was reissued as a two @-@ disc CD set on Sony in May 2012 , containing remastered editions of the original digital tape and a previously unreleased ½ -inch analogue tape . The reissues placed in several international charts and in July 2013 , Loveless was certified Silver in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 My Bloody Valentine were scheduled to record at Blackwing Studios in Southwark , London for the month of February 1989 , and intended to use the time to conceptualise a new , more studio @-@ based sound for their second album . Shields said that Creation first believed the album could be recorded " in five days " . According to Shields " when it became clear that wasn 't going to happen , they [ Creation ] freaked . " After several unproductive months , the band relocated in September to the basement studio The Elephant and Wapping , where they spent eight unproductive weeks . In @-@ house engineer Nick Robbins said Shields made it clear from the outset that he ( Robbins ) " was just there to press the buttons . " Robbins was quickly replaced by Harold Burgon , but according to Shields , Burgon 's main contribution was to show the group how to use the in @-@ studio computer . Burgon and Shields spent three weeks at the <unk> studio in Berkshire working on the Glider EP , which Shields and Creation owner Alan McGee agreed would be released in advance of the album . Alan Moulder was hired to mix the Glider song " Soon " at Trident 2 studio in Victoria ( the song would reappear as the closing track on Loveless ) . Shields said of Moulder , " As soon as we worked with him we realized we 'd love to some more ! " When the group returned to work on the album Moulder was the sole engineer Shields trusted enough to perform tasks such as miking the amplifiers ; all the other credited engineers were told " We 're so on top of this you don 't even have to come to work . " Shields has since stated that " these engineers — with the exception of Alan Moulder and later Anjali Dutt — were all just the people who came with the studio ... everything we wanted to do was wrong , according to them , " although the band did give credit on the album sleeve to anyone who was present during the recordings , " even if all they did was fix tea " , according to Shields . 
 During the spring of 1990 , Anjali Dutt was hired to replace Moulder , who had left to work with the bands Shakespears Sister and Ride . Dutt assisted in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks . During this period , the band recorded in various studios , often spending just a single day at a studio before deciding that it was unsuitable . In May 1990 , My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway as their primary location , and work began in earnest on the album , as well as a second EP , Tremolo . Like Glider , Tremolo contained a song — " To Here Knows When " — that would later appear on Loveless . The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 in order to tour in support of the release of Glider . When Moulder returned to the project in August , he was surprised by how little work had been completed . By that point Creation Records was concerned at how much the album was costing . Moulder left again in March 1991 to work for the noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain . 
 In an interview with Select , Shields explained the stop @-@ start nature of his recording , using " When You Sleep " as an example : 
 " We recorded the drums in September ' 89 . The guitar was done in December . The bass was done in … er … April . 1990 we 're in , now . Then nothing happens for a year really . " So it doesn 't have vocals at this stage ? " No . " Does it have words ? " No . " Does it even have a title ? " No . It has a song number . ' Song 12 ' it was called . And … I 'm trying to remember … the melody line was done in ' 91 . The vocals were ' 91 . There were huge gaps though . Months and months of not touching songs . Years . I used to forget what tunings I 'd used . " 
 The vocal tracks were taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991 . This was the first time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was involved in the recording . Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth , and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving . According to engineer Guy <unk> , " We weren 't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal . You 'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing . If it stopped , you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top . " On most days , the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record . Dutt recalled : " Kevin would sing a track , and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words she thought he might have sung " . 
 In July 1991 , Creation agreed to relocate the production to Eastcote studio , following unexplained complaints from Shields . However , the cash @-@ poor Creation Records was unable to pay the bill for their time at Britannia Row , and the studio refused to return the band 's equipment . Dutt recalled , " I don 't know what excuse Kevin gave them for leaving . He had to raise the money himself to get the gear out . " Shields ' unexpected and random behaviour , the constant delays , and studio changes were having a material effect both on Creation 's finances and the health of their staff . Dutt later admitted being desperate to leave the project , while Creation 's second @-@ in @-@ command Dick Green had a nervous breakdown around this time . Green later recalled , " It was two years into the album , and I phoned Shields up in tears . I was going ' You have to deliver me this record ' . " During this time , both Shields and Butcher became affected with tinnitus , and had to delay recording for a further number of weeks while they recovered . Concerned friends and band members suggested this was a result of the unusually loud volumes the group played at their shows . Shields dismissed these concerns as " Ill @-@ informed hysteria " . Although Alan McGee was still upbeat and positive about his investment , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Green , who by this time was opening the label 's morning post " shaking with fear " , became a concern to his co @-@ workers . Publicist Laurence <unk> , aware of the label 's inability to cover further studio bills , recalled Green 's hair turning grey overnight . " He would have not gone grey if it was not for that album " , <unk> said . 
 With the vocal tracks completed , a final mix of the album was undertaken with engineer Dick Meaney at the Church in Crouch End during the autumn of 1991 ; it was the nineteenth studio in which Loveless had been worked on . The album was edited on an aged machine that had previously been used to cut together dialog for movies in the 1970s . Its computer threw the entire album out of phase . Shields was able to put it back together from memory , yet when it came to mastering the album , to Creation 's dismay , he needed 13 days , rather than the usual one day . 
 As the previously prolific band were unusually quiet , the UK music press began to speculate . Melody Maker calculated that the total recording cost had come close to £ 250 @,@ 000 ; however , McGee , Green , and Shields dispute this . Shields argued that that estimated cost ( and Creation 's near @-@ bankruptcy ) was a myth exaggerated by McGee because the Creation owner " thought it would be cool . " According to Shields , " The amount we spent nobody knows because we never counted . But we worked it out ourselves just by working out how much the studios cost and how much all the engineers cost . 160 thousand pounds was the most we could come to as the actual money that was spent . " In Green 's opinion , the Melody Maker 's estimate erred on the low side , by £ 20 @,@ 000 . He said , " Once you 'd even got it recorded and mixed , the very act of compiling , EQ @-@ ing , etcetera took weeks on its own . " In a December 1991 interview , Shields said that most of the money claimed to have been spent on the album was simply " money to live on " over three years , with the album itself only costing " a few thousand " . He also claimed that the album represented only four months work over two years . Shields later said that most of the money spent was the band 's own money , and that " Creation probably spent fifteen to twenty thousand pounds of their own money on it , and that 's it . They never showed us any accounts , and then they got bought out by Sony . " 
 = = Music = = 
 While Butcher contributed about a third of the album 's lyrics , most of the music on Loveless was written and performed by Shields . Shields stated , " I 'm actually the only musician on the record except for the Colm song [ ' Touched ' ] . " Shields assumed Butcher 's guitarist duties during the recording process ; Butcher admitted that she had not minded because she felt she " was never a great guitarist " . Bassist Debbie Googe did not perform on the album , though she received a credit on the album sleeve . Googe said , " At the beginning I used to go down [ to the studio ] most days but after a while I began to feel pretty superfluous so I went down less . " Butcher explained , " for Kevin to actually translate to Debbie what he had in his head and play it right would have been an agonizing process . " " It wasn 't collaborative at all " , Alan Moulder said of the album 's recording . " Kevin had a clear view of what he wanted , but he never explained it . " 
 Taking influence from the Wall of Sound practices established by the likes of Phil Spector and Brian Wilson , Loveless was largely recorded in mono sound , as Shields felt it important that the album 's sound consisted of " the guitar smack bang in the middle and no chorus , no modulation effect " . Shields wavers his guitar 's tremolo bar as he strums , which contributes , in part , to the band 's distinctive sound . This technique — nicknamed " Glide guitar " — causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune . Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar , " People were thinking it 's hundreds of guitars , when it 's actually got less guitar tracks than most people 's demo tapes have . " The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s , My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals . He insisted , " No other band played that guitar like me [ ... ] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm " . Shields aimed to use " very simple minimal effects " which often were the result of involved studio work . He stated , " The songs are really simply structured . A lot of them are purposely like that . That way you can get away with a lot more when you mess around with the contents " . In a 1992 Guitar World interview , Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah @-@ wah pedal on " I Only Said " by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp . After recording the track , he then bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while he adjusted the EQ levels manually . The interviewer asked if Shields could have achieved the same effect more easily by simply using a wah @-@ wah pedal , to which the guitarist replied , " In attitude toward sound , yes . But not in approach . " 
 All but two of the drum tracks are composed of samples performed by drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig . Because Ó Cíosóig was suffering from physical and personal problems during the album 's recording , samples of various drum patterns that he was able to perform in his condition were recorded . According to Shields , " [ i ] t 's exactly what Colm would have done , it just took longer to do . " Ó Cíosóig recovered enough to play live on two of the album 's songs , " Only Shallow " and " Touched " , the latter of which was composed and performed entirely by the drummer . Shields believes that listeners are unable to tell the difference between Ó Cíosóig 's live drumming and the drum loops aside from the tracks intended to have an obviously " sampled " sound , like the dance @-@ oriented " Soon " . The album makes extensive use of samples , with Shields stating , " Most of the samples are feedback . We learnt from guitar feedback , with lots of distortion , that you can make any instrument , any one that you can imagine " . 
 The vocals , handled jointly by Shields and Butcher , are kept relatively low in the mix , and are for the most part highly pitched . On occasion Shields sang the higher register and Butcher the lower one . According to Shields , because the band had spent so long working on the album 's vocals , he " couldn 't tolerate really clear vocals , where you just hear one voice " , thus " it had to be more like a sound . " Butcher explained her " dreamy , sensual " style vocals , saying , " Often when we do vocals , it 's 7 : 30 in the morning ; I 've usually just fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing . " To aid this effect , Shields and Ó Cíosóig even sampled Butcher 's voice and reused it as instrumentation . The layered vocals on " When You Sleep " were born out of frustration with trying to get the right take . Shields commented that " The vocals sound like that because it became boring and too destructive trying to get the right vocal . So I decided to put all the vocals in . ( It had been sung 12 or 13 times ) . " He explained : 
 " On ' When You Sleep ' it sounds like me and Bilinda singing together , but it 's just me – me slowed down and me speeded up at the same time . Some songs we sang over and over until we got bored – usually between 12 and 18 times . I started sorting through the tapes and it did my head in , so I just played them all together and it was really good – like one , vaguely distinct voice . " 
 The lyrics are deliberately obscure ; Shields joked that he once considered rating various attempts to decipher the words on the band 's website according to a percentage of accuracy . He claims that he and Butcher " spent way more time on the lyrics than ever on the music " . The words were often written in late @-@ night eight- to ten @-@ hour @-@ long sessions before the pair were due to record the vocals . The pair worked diligently to ensure the lyrics were not lackluster , even though few changes actually resulted ; Shields said , " There 's nothing worse than bad lyrics . " Nonetheless , pressed by Select 's David Cavanagh to reveal just the first line of " Loomer " , Butcher refused , and Shields claimed to have " absolutely no idea " what she was singing . 
 = = Release = = 
 Following the album 's low @-@ budget release , Shields boasted , " We know more about how the record industry works than our record company half the time . We do . I 'm not joking . " That winter the band toured Europe , an event music critic David Cavanagh described as a " unique chapter in live music " . To recreate the higher tones from Loveless , Shields employed American flautist Anna Quimby . According to a friend of the band , " She had a little skirt on , black tights ... she was a little indie girl . But when she blew into the flute , it was like fucking Woodstock " . NME editor Danny Kelly attended a show he described as " more like torture than entertainment , I had a half pint of lager ; they hit their first note and it was so loud that it sent the glass hurtling " . A U.S. spring tour followed , during which Shields and Butcher tested their audiences ' ability to sustain noise played at high volumes . Critic Mark Kemp said of the American tour , " After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in , people are screaming and shaking their fists . After a minute you wonder what 's going on . After another minute it 's total confusion . The noise starts hurting . The noise continues . After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths . After four minutes , a calm takes over . " The tour saw My Bloody Valentine accused of criminal negligence by the music press , who took exception to the long period of extreme noise played during " You Made Me Realise " , referring to it as " the holocaust " . In December 2000 Mojo magazine rated the tour as the second loudest in history .

 Although Shields feared a critical panning , reviews of Loveless were almost unanimously favourable . " An album without parallel , " wrote Andrew Perry in Select . " Its creative inspiration defies belief . Though ' To Here Knows When ' is pretty well the weirdest track of the eleven , that glorious distortion gives a fair signal of what to expect – the unexpected . Everything you hear confounds your idea of how a pop song should be played , arranged and produced . " " The instrumental ' Touched ' is especially startling , " noted Martin Aston in Q , " like a drunken fight between a syrupy Disney soundtrack and an Eastern mantra . All in all , Loveless amounts to a virtual reinvention of the guitar . " 
 NME awarded the album an eight out of ten score . Reviewer Dele Fadele saw My Bloody Valentine as the " blueprint " for the shoegaze genre , and wrote : " with ' Loveless ' you could 've expected the Irish / English partnership to succumb to self @-@ parody or mimic The Scene That 's Delighted To Eat <unk> [ ... ] But no , ' Loveless ' fires a silver @-@ coated bullet into the future , daring all @-@ comers to try and recreate its mixture of moods , feelings , emotion , styles and , yes , innovations . " While Fadele expressed some disappointment that the group seemed to disassociate themselves from dance music and reggae basslines , he concluded " ' Loveless ' ups the ante , and , however decadent one might find the idea of elevating other human beings to deities , My Bloody Valentine , failings and all , deserve more than your respect . " Melody Maker writer Simon Reynolds praised the album , and wrote that Loveless " [ reaffirms ] how unique , how peerless MBV are . " He declared , " Along with Mercury Rev 's ' <unk> is Steam ' , ' Loveless ' is the outermost , innermost , uttermost rock record of 1991 . " Reynolds noted that his only criticism was that " while My Bloody Valentine have amplified and refined what they already were , they 've failed to mutate or leap into any kind of beyond . " Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars . In a review that also covered Chapterhouse and Creation labelmates Velvet Crush , reviewer Ira Robbins wrote , " Despite the record 's intense ability to disorient — this is real do @-@ not @-@ adjust @-@ your @-@ set stuff — the effect is strangely uplifting . Loveless oozes a sonic balm that first embraces and then softly <unk> the frantic stress of life . " Spin gave Loveless a mixed review with writer Jim Greer noting that the album 's songs are " standard @-@ ish and dull " and concluded that he felt " The warped music is a cool idea and I recommend the album — but not on the basis of the singing or the songs " . 
 While Creation were pleased with the final album , and the initial music press reviews were positive , the label soon realised that although , in the words of plugger James Kyllo , " it was such a beautiful record , and it was wonderful to have it ... it just didn 't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it . " Alan McGee liked the record , but admitted , " It was quite clear that we couldn 't bear the idea of going through that again , because there was just nothing to say that [ Shields ] wouldn 't do exactly the same again . That 's enough . Lets step back " . Despite a severe shortage of money , Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991 . At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult — there would be no singles , and the band 's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve . McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated . He recalled , " I thought : I went to the wall for you . If this record bombs , I 've stolen my father 's money . And they were so ... not understanding of anybody else 's position . " McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album 's release because he could not bear working with Shields again ; " It was either him or me " , he told The Guardian in 2004 . Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart , and failed to chart in the United States , where it was distributed by Sire Records . In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225 @,@ 000 copies sold .

 Loveless has ranked highly on a number of critics ' lists . The album ranked number fourteen in the 1991 Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics ' poll . In 1999 , Pitchfork Media named Loveless the best album of the 1990s . However , in their 2003 revision of the list , it moved to number two , swapping places with Radiohead 's OK Computer . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 219 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . In 2004 The Observer ranked it at number 20 in its " 100 Greatest British Albums " list , declaring it " the last great extreme rock album " . In Spin 's entry for Loveless on its list of " 100 Greatest Albums 1985 – 2005 " ( where it was ranked at number 22 ) , Chuck Klosterman wrote , " Whenever anyone uses the phrase swirling guitars , this record is why . A testament to studio production and single @-@ minded perfectionism , Loveless has a layered , inverted thickness that makes harsh sounds soft and fragile moments vast . " In 2008 , Loveless topped The Irish Times ' " Top 40 Irish Albums of All Time " critics ' list , in 2013 , it placed third in the Irish Independent 's " Top 30 Irish Albums of All Time " <unk> and in 2014 , it placed ninth on the Alternative Nation site 's " Top 10 Underrated 90 's Alternative Rock Albums " list . In 1999 , Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 1 on his list of " The Top 136 Or So Albums Of The Nineties " . In 2013 , NME ranked the album at number 18 on their " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " list . The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .

 Despite being poised for a " popular breakthrough " following Loveless ' critical favour , My Bloody Valentine recorded only sporadically in the two decades following the album 's release — including the contribution of a cover of " We Have All the Time in the World " from the James Bond film On Her Majesty 's Secret Service to a charity compilation , and a cover of the Wire song " Map Ref . 41 Degrees N 93 Degrees W " for the tribute album Whore : Tribute to Wire . Unable to finalise a third album , Shields isolated himself and , in his own words , went " crazy " , drawing comparisons in the music press to the behavior of musicians such as Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd . The other band members went their own ways during the period of inactivity following Loveless : Butcher contributed vocals to Collapsed Lung 's 1996 single " Board Game " , and two tracks ( " Ballad Night " and " Casino <unk> " ) from the band 's 1996 album Cooler , Googe had been sighted working as a cab driver in London and formed the supergroup Snowpony in 1996 , Ó Cíosóig joined Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions , while Shields collaborated with Yo La Tengo , Primal Scream and Dinosaur Jr . 
 Reportedly , two separate albums of new music were recorded by Shields in his home studio , but were abandoned . According to sources , one was possibly influenced by jungle music . Shields later confirmed that at least one full album of new material was abandoned . He said , " We did an album 's worth of half @-@ finished stuff , and it did just get dumped , but it was worth dumping . It was dead . It hadn 't got that spirit , that life in it . " He later explained , " I just stopped making records myself , and I suppose that must just seem weird to people . ' Why 'd you do that ? ' The answer is , it wasn 't as good [ as Loveless ] . And I always promised myself I 'd never do that , put out a worse record . " Shields later said to Magnet magazine , " We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless we die or something , " and attributed the band 's sparse output to a lack of inspiration . A third My Bloody Valentine album , MBV , was finally released in 2013 , 22 years after Loveless . 
 Loveless 's influence has grown with time , and the album has influenced a wide variety of other artists . Music critic Jim DeRogatis wrote in Turn On Your Mind : Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock that " the forward @-@ looking sounds of this unique disc have positioned the band as one of the most influential and inspiring bands since the Velvet Underground . " Authors Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell wrote that the album " might be so progressive that nothing else will ever match it . " Instrumental band <unk> covered the album in its entirety on Loveless ( 2007 ) , replacing vocals with steel guitar and distortion with a clean sound . The whole album was also covered exclusively by Japanese artists for the tribute album , Yellow Loveless ( 2013 ) . 
 Brian Eno has praised the album and said , regarding the song " Soon " , that " [ i ] t set a new standard for pop . It 's the vaguest music ever to have been a hit . " Robert Smith of The Cure discovered Loveless after a period of almost exclusively listening to " disco , or Irish bands like the Dubliners " as a means of avoiding his contemporaries , and said , " [ My Bloody Valentine ] was the first band I heard who quite clearly pissed all over us , and their album Loveless is certainly one of my all @-@ time three favourite records . It 's the sound of someone [ Shields ] who is so driven that they 're demented . And the fact that they spent so much time and money on it is so excellent . " Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins told Spin , " It 's rare in guitar @-@ based music that somebody does something new [ ... ] At the time , everybody was like , ' How the fuck are they doing this ? ' And , of course , it 's way simpler than anybody would imagine . " Trey Anastasio of jam band Phish believed that " Loveless [ was ] the best album recorded in the ' 90s " , and wanted his band to cover the album in its entirety for a Halloween show . Robert Pollard of indie rock band Guided by Voices acknowledged the album as a source of inspiration , noting , " Sometimes when I want to write lyrics , I 'll listen to Loveless . Because of the way the vocals are buried , you can almost listen to the songs as if they 're instrumental pieces . " Loveless has also been said by Jim DeRogatis to have been a considerable influence on British band Radiohead .
