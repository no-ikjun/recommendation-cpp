 Cleveland pursued former Steelers coach and Browns linebacker Bill Cowher and former Browns scout Scott Pioli for the head coaching job . The team , however , hired former New York Jets coach Eric Mangini in January 2009 . Before the start of the season , Mangini and the front office traded Winslow to the Buccaneers after five seasons marked by injuries and a motorcycle crash that threatened to end the tight end 's career . The Browns showed little sign of improvement in Mangini 's first year , finishing 5 – 11 in 2009 . While Cleveland lost 11 of its first 12 games , the team won the final four games of the season , including a 13 – 6 victory over the rival Steelers . 
 At the end of the season , Lerner hired former Packers coach Mike Holmgren as team president , moving Keenan to chief financial officer . A month later , the owner hired Eagles front @-@ office executive Tom Heckert as general manager . Heckert replaced former general manager George <unk> , who was fired the previous November . The new management said Mangini would return for a second season . 
 Under Holmgren and Heckert 's watch , the Browns overhauled the quarterbacking corps . Brady Quinn was traded to the Denver Broncos for running back Peyton Hillis in March , while Derek Anderson was released . Meanwhile , Jake Delhomme was acquired from Carolina and Seneca Wallace from Seattle . The team also drafted quarterback Colt McCoy from the University of Texas . With Delhomme as the starting quarterback , Cleveland lost its first three games and continued to struggle . Wallace started four games , but was replaced by McCoy in the second half of the season . Hillis had a breakout season , rushing for 1 @,@ 177 yards , and was later chosen to appear on the cover of the Madden NFL 12 video game . Despite the emergence of Hillis , the Browns finished with a 5 – 11 record for the second season in a row , and Mangini was fired in January 2011 . 
 = = = Pat Shurmur takes over : 2012 = = = 
 Following Mangini 's firing , the Browns named Pat Shurmur as his replacement . Formerly the offensive coordinator for the St. Louis Rams , Shurmur helped groom quarterback Sam Bradford . Holmgren and Heckert hoped he could do the same with McCoy . Contract negotiations between the NFL Players Association and the league shortened the 2011 off @-@ season , which gave Shurmur little time to coach McCoy or institute his version of the West Coast offense . The team started at 2 – 1 , then 3 @-@ 3 , but McCoy 's struggles and a lack of offensive production led to a series of defeats , including six straight losses to end the year . The Browns finished the season at 4 – 12 . During that same season , comedian and frustrated Browns fan Mike Polk made a video to complain about the team 's futility , screaming " You are a factory of sadness ! " while facing Cleveland Browns Stadium . " Factory of Sadness " has since become a colloquial nickname for the stadium . 
 In the offseason , Hillis signed as a free agent with the Kansas City Chiefs after a lackluster season and unsuccessful contract talks with the Browns . In the 2012 draft , the Browns chose running back Trent Richardson with the third selection and took quarterback Brandon Weeden with the 22nd pick . Weeden was expected to replace McCoy at quarterback after McCoy 's limited success in one and a half seasons as the starter . 
 On September 6 , Art Modell died in Baltimore at the age of 87 . Although the Browns planned to have a moment of silence on their home opener for their former owner , his family asked the team not to , well aware of the less @-@ than @-@ friendly reaction it was likely to get . Weeden started the Browns ' first game of the season . The 28 @-@ year @-@ old rookie threw four interceptions in a 17 – 16 loss to Philadelphia in which the Browns ' only touchdown was scored by the defense .

 Cleveland started the season with a 1 – 6 record , recording its first win against the Bengals in October and snapping an 11 @-@ game losing streak stretching back to the previous season . After the game , NFL owners approved the sale of the team by Lerner to Jimmy Haslam , a truck @-@ stop magnate , for about $ 1 billion . In his first move as owner , Haslam announced that Holmgren would retire after the season and that Joe Banner , a former Eagles executive , would be appointed as the team 's chief executive . 
 On December 31 , 2012 , head coach Pat Shurmur and general manager Tom Heckert were fired . Shurmur went 9 – 23 in his two seasons as head coach . 
 After interviewing numerous candidates such as Chip Kelly and Ken Whisenhunt , the Browns decided to hire former offensive coordinator and tight ends coach , Rob <unk> , on January 10 , 2013 . 
 On January 15 , 2013 , Joe Banner announced the naming rights to Cleveland Browns Stadium were sold to FirstEnergy , and the stadium would be renamed FirstEnergy Stadium . The name change officially received Cleveland City Council approval on February 15 , 2013 . 
 On January 18 , 2013 , the Browns hired Michael Lombardi – who had a previous stint with the Browns in the player personnel department in the ' 80s and ' 90s – as Vice President of Player Personnel ( two months later he was officially given the title of general manager ) , making him Tom Heckert 's replacement . The Browns would finish with a 4 @-@ 12 record in the 2013 season , last in the AFC North Division , including losing their last seven games . Following the 2013 season finale on December 29 , 2013 , the Browns fired <unk> after only one year as head coach . 
 On January 24 , 2014 , the Browns hired Mike <unk> ( previously a defensive coordinator for the NY Jets , then Buffalo ) as the 15th full @-@ time head coach in team history ( and seventh since the team 's return in 1999 ) . On February 11 , 2014 the Browns announced that Lombardi would be replaced by Ray Farmer as GM , and that Joe Banner would resign as CEO . In the first round of the 2014 NFL draft , the Browns selected cornerback Justin Gilbert from Oklahoma State with the eighth pick , and much @-@ hyped Heisman Trophy @-@ winning quarterback Johnny Manziel of Texas A & M with the 22nd overall pick . On October 5 , 2014 , the Browns staged the largest rally in team history , when after trailing the Tennessee Titans 28 @-@ 3 with 1 : 09 left in the second quarter , Cleveland scored 26 unanswered points to win the game 29 @-@ 28 . This was also the largest rally by a road team in NFL history . After a 7 @-@ 4 start , the Browns collapsed , losing their final five games to finish the 2014 season at 7 @-@ 9 , which placed them in last place in the AFC North , and missed the playoffs for the twelfth consecutive season . 
 In February 2015 , the team made headlines when two high profile players made the news due to substance abuse issues . On Monday February 2 , it was announced that quarterback Johnny Manziel had checked himself into a treatment center , reportedly for alcoholism . The following day , wide receiver Josh Gordon was suspended for the 2015 season due to failing a drug test . On February 28 , it was revealed that former Chicago Bears quarterback Josh McCown had signed a three @-@ year deal with the Browns . On March 30 , the NFL announced that Browns general manager Ray Farmer would be suspended for the first four regular season games , and that the team would be fined $ 250 @,@ 000 for Farmer text messaging the coaching staff during games in the 2014 season , which is against NFL rules . The story had been dubbed " <unk> " due to its scandalous nature . After going 2 @-@ 3 over the first five games of the 2015 season , the Browns collapsed , losing all but one of their remaining 11 games to finish 3 @-@ 13 . Both <unk> and Farmer were fired from their respective jobs as head coach and general manager the day after the season ended . 
 On January 13 , 2016 , the Browns hired Hue Jackson , who was the offensive coordinator of the archrival Bengals and formerly head coach of the Oakland Raiders , as their 16th head coach . 
 = Serpin = 
 Serpins are a superfamily of proteins with similar structures that were first identified for their protease inhibition activity and are found in all kingdoms of life . The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin @-@ like serine proteases ( serine protease inhibitors ) . They are notable for their unusual mechanism of action , in which they irreversibly inhibit their target protease by undergoing a large conformational change to disrupt its active site . This contrasts with the more common competitive mechanism for protease inhibitors that bind to and block access to the protease active site . 
 Protease inhibition by serpins controls an array of biological processes , including coagulation and inflammation , and consequently these proteins are the target of medical research . Their unique conformational change also makes them of interest to the structural biology and protein folding research communities . The conformational @-@ change mechanism confers certain advantages , but it also has drawbacks : serpins are vulnerable to mutations that can result in serpinopathies such as protein misfolding and the formation of inactive long @-@ chain polymers . Serpin polymerisation not only reduces the amount of active inhibitor , but also leads to accumulation of the polymers , causing cell death and organ failure . 
 Although most serpins control proteolytic cascades , some proteins with a serpin structure are not enzyme inhibitors , but instead perform diverse functions such as storage ( as in egg white — ovalbumin ) , transport as in hormone carriage proteins ( thyroxine @-@ binding globulin , cortisol @-@ binding globulin ) and molecular chaperoning ( HSP47 ) . The term serpin is used to describe these members as well , despite their non @-@ inhibitory function , since they are evolutionarily related . 
 = = History = = 
 Protease inhibitory activity in blood plasma was first reported in the late 1800s , but it was not until the 1950s that the serpins antithrombin and alpha 1 @-@ antitrypsin were isolated . Initial research focused on their role in human disease : alpha 1 @-@ antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most common genetic disorders , causing emphysema , and antithrombin deficiency results in thrombosis . 
 In the 1980s , it became clear that these inhibitors were part of superfamily of related proteins that included both protease inhibitors ( e.g. alpha 1 @-@ antitrypsin ) and non @-@ inhibitory members ( e.g. ovalbumin ) . The name " serpin " was coined based on the most common activity of the superfamily ( serine protease inhibitors ) . Around the same time , the first structures were solved for serpin proteins ( first in the relaxed , and later in the stressed conformation ) . The structures indicated that the inhibitory mechanism involved an unusual conformational change and prompted the subsequent structural focus of serpin studies . 
 Over 1000 serpins have now been identified , including 36 human proteins , as well as molecules in all kingdoms of life — animals , plants , fungi , bacteria , and archaea — and some viruses . In the 2000s , a systematic nomenclature was introduced in order to categorise members of the serpin superfamily based on their evolutionary relationships . Serpins are therefore the largest and most diverse superfamily of protease inhibitors . 
 = = Activity = = 
 Most serpins are protease inhibitors , targeting extracellular , chymotrypsin @-@ like serine proteases . These proteases possess a nucleophilic serine residue in a catalytic triad in their active site . Examples include thrombin , trypsin , and human neutrophil elastase . Serpins act as irreversible , suicide inhibitors by trapping an intermediate of the protease 's catalytic mechanism . 
 Some serpins inhibit other protease classes , typically cysteine proteases , and are termed " cross @-@ class inhibitors " . These enzymes differ from <unk> in that they use a nucleophilic cysteine residue , rather than a serine , in their active site . Nonetheless , the enzymatic chemistry is similar , and the mechanism of inhibition by serpins is the same for both classes of protease . Examples of cross @-@ class inhibitory serpins include serpin B4 a squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 ( SCCA @-@ 1 ) and the avian serpin myeloid and <unk> nuclear termination stage @-@ specific protein ( MENT ) , which both inhibit papain @-@ like cysteine proteases . 
 = = Biological function and localization = = 
 = = = Protease inhibition = = = 
 Approximately two @-@ thirds of human serpins perform extracellular roles , inhibiting proteases in the bloodstream in order to modulate their activities . For example , extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting ( antithrombin ) , the inflammatory and immune responses ( antitrypsin , antichymotrypsin , and C1 @-@ inhibitor ) and tissue remodelling ( PAI @-@ 1 ) . By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases , they can also affect development . The table of human serpins ( below ) provides examples of the range of functions performed by human serpin , as well as some of the diseases that result from serpin deficiency . 
 The protease targets of intracellular inhibitory serpins have been difficult to identify , since many of these molecules appear to perform overlapping roles . Further , many human serpins lack precise functional equivalents in model organisms such as the mouse . Nevertheless , an important function of intracellular serpins may be to protect against the inappropriate activity of proteases inside the cell . For example , one of the best @-@ characterised human intracellular serpins is Serpin B9 , which inhibits the cytotoxic granule protease granzyme B. In doing so , Serpin B9 may protect against inadvertent release of granzyme B and premature or unwanted activation of cell death pathways . 
 Some viruses use serpins to disrupt protease functions in their host . The cowpox viral serpin CrmA ( cytokine response modifier A ) is used in order to avoid inflammatory and apoptotic responses of infected host cells . CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host 's inflammatory response through inhibition of IL @-@ 1 and L @-@ 18 processing by the cysteine protease caspase @-@ 1 . In eukaryotes , a plant serpin inhibits both <unk> and a papain @-@ like cysteine protease . 
 = = = Non @-@ inhibitory roles = = = 
 Non @-@ inhibitory extracellular serpins also perform a wide array of important roles . Thyroxine @-@ binding globulin and transcortin transport the hormones thyroxine and cortisol , respectively . The non @-@ inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in egg white . Its exact function is unknown , but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus . Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone , essential for proper folding of collagen . It acts by stabilising collagen 's triple helix whilst it is being processed in the endoplasmic reticulum . 
 Some serpins are both protease inhibitors and perform additional roles . For example , the nuclear cysteine protease inhibitor MENT , in birds also acts as a chromatin remodelling molecule in a bird 's red blood cells . 
 = = Structure = = 
 All serpins share a common structure ( or fold ) , despite their varied functions . All typically have three β @-@ sheets ( named A , B and C ) and eight or nine α @-@ helices ( named <unk> – <unk> ) . The most significant regions to serpin function are the A @-@ sheet and the reactive centre loop ( RCL ) . The A @-@ sheet includes two β @-@ strands that are in a parallel orientation with a region between them called the ' shutter ' , and upper region called the ' breach ' . The RCL forms the initial interaction with the target protease in inhibitory molecules . Structures have been solved showing the RCL either fully exposed or partially inserted into the A @-@ sheet , and serpins are thought to be in dynamic equilibrium between these two states . The RCL also only makes temporary interactions with the rest of the structure , and is therefore highly flexible and exposed to the solvent . 
 The serpin structures that have been determined cover several different conformations , which has been necessary for the understanding of their multiple @-@ step mechanism of action . Structural biology has therefore played a central role in the understanding of serpin function and biology . 
 = = Conformational change and inhibitory mechanism = = 
 Inhibitory serpins do not inhibit their target proteases by the typical competitive ( lock @-@ and @-@ key ) mechanism used by most small protease inhibitors ( e.g. Kunitz @-@ type inhibitors ) . Instead , serpins use an unusual conformational change , which disrupts the structure of the protease and prevents it from completing catalysis . The conformational change involves the RCL moving to the opposite end of the protein and inserting into β @-@ sheet A , forming an extra antiparallel β @-@ strand . This converts the serpin from a stressed state , to a lower @-@ energy relaxed state ( S to R transition ) . 
 Serine and cysteine proteases catalyse peptide bond cleavage by a two @-@ step process . Initially , the catalytic residue of the active site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate . This releases the new N @-@ terminus and forms a covalent ester @-@ bond between the enzyme and the substrate . This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl @-@ enzyme intermediate . For standard substrates , the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C @-@ terminus is released to complete catalysis . However , when a serpin is cleaved by a protease , it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl @-@ enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed . The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease . 
 Since the RCL is still covalently attached to the protease via the ester bond , the S to R transition pulls protease from the top to the bottom of the serpin and distorts the catalytic triad . The distorted protease can only hydrolyse the acyl enzyme intermediate extremely slowly and so the protease remains covalently attached for days to weeks . Serpins are classed as irreversible inhibitors and as suicide inhibitors since each serpin protein permanently inactivates a single protease , and can only function once . 
 = = = Allosteric activation = = = 
 The conformational mobility of serpins provides a key advantage over static lock @-@ and @-@ key protease inhibitors . In particular , the function of inhibitory serpins can be regulated by allosteric interactions with specific cofactors . The X @-@ ray crystal structures of antithrombin , heparin cofactor II , MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted into the top of the A β @-@ sheet . The partially inserted conformation is important because co @-@ factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form . This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor . 
 The archetypal example of this situation is antithrombin , which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state . The primary specificity determining residue ( the P1 arginine ) points toward the body of the serpin and is unavailable to the protease . Upon binding a high @-@ affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long @-@ chain heparin , antithrombin undergoes a conformational change , RCL expulsion , and exposure of the P1 arginine . The heparin pentasaccharide @-@ bound form of antithrombin is , thus , a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa . Furthermore , both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites ( called <unk> ) for heparin . Heparin , therefore , also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin , further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties . After the initial interaction , the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released . This interaction is physiologically important . For example , after injury to the blood vessel wall , heparin is exposed , and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response . Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux , a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti @-@ clotting drug . 
 = = = Latent conformation = = = 
 Certain serpins spontaneously undergo the S to R transition without having been cleaved by a protease , to form a conformation termed the latent state . Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors . The conformational change to latency is not exactly the same as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin . Since the RCL is still intact , the first strand of the C @-@ sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion . 
 Regulation of the latency transition can act as a control mechanism in some serpins , such as PAI @-@ 1 . Although PAI @-@ 1 is produced in the inhibitory S conformation , it " auto @-@ inactivates " by changing to the latent state unless it is bound to the cofactor <unk> . Similarly , antithrombin can also spontaneously convert to the latent state , as an additional modulation mechanism to its allosteric activation by heparin . Finally , the N @-@ terminus of <unk> , a serpin from <unk> <unk> , is required to lock the molecule in the native inhibitory state . Disruption of interactions made by the N @-@ terminal region results in spontaneous conformational change of this serpin to the latent conformation . 
 = = = Conformational change in non @-@ inhibitory functions = = = 
 Certain non @-@ inhibitory serpins also use the serpin conformational change as part of their function . For example , the native ( S ) form of thyroxine @-@ binding globulin has high affinity for thyroxine , whereas the cleaved ( R ) form has low affinity . Similarly , transcortin has higher affinity for cortisol when in its native ( S ) state , than its cleaved ( R ) state . Thus , in these serpins , RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release , rather than protease inhibition . 
 In some serpins , the S to R transition can activate cell signalling events . In these cases , a serpin that has formed a complex with its target protease , is then recognised by a receptor . The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor . The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells to the presence of protease activity . This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade . 
 = = Degradation = = 
 When a serpin inhibits a target protease , it forms a permanent complex , which needs to be disposed of . For extracellular serpins , the final serpin @-@ enzyme complexes are rapidly cleared from circulation . One mechanism by which this occurs in mammals is via the low @-@ density lipoprotein receptor @-@ related protein ( LRP ) , which binds to inhibitory complexes made by antithrombin , <unk> @-@ 1 , and neuroserpin , causing cellular uptake . Similarly , the Drosophila serpin , necrotic , is degraded in the lysosome after being trafficked into the cell by the <unk> Receptor @-@ 1 ( homologous to the mammalian LDL receptor family ) . 
 = = Disease and serpinopathies = = 
 Serpins are involved in a wide array of physiological functions , and so mutations in genes encoding them can cause a range of diseases . Mutations that change the activity , specificity or aggregation properties of serpins all affect how they function . The majority of serpin @-@ related diseases are the result of serpin polymerisation into aggregates , though several other types of disease @-@ linked mutations also occur . The disorder α @-@ Antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most common hereditary diseases . 
 = = = Inactivity or absence = = = 
 Since the stressed serpin fold is high @-@ energy , mutations can cause them to incorrectly change into their lower @-@ energy conformations ( e.g. relaxed or latent ) before they have correctly performed their inhibitory role . 
 Mutations that affect the rate or the extent of RCL insertion into the A @-@ sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease . Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once , the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease . Similarly , mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by reducing the amount of active inhibitory serpin . For example , the disease @-@ linked antithrombin variants <unk> and wobble , both promote formation of the latent state . 
 The structure of the disease @-@ linked mutant of antichymotrypsin ( <unk> ) revealed another , inactive " δ @-@ conformation " . In the δ @-@ conformation , four residues of the RCL are inserted into the top of β @-@ sheet A. The bottom half of the sheet is filled as a result of one of the α @-@ helices ( the F @-@ helix ) partially switching to a β @-@ strand conformation , completing the β @-@ sheet hydrogen bonding . It is unclear whether other serpins can adopt this conformer , and whether this conformation has a functional role , but it is speculated that the δ @-@ conformation may be adopted by Thyroxine @-@ binding globulin during thyroxine release . The non @-@ inhibitory proteins related to serpins can also cause diseases when mutated . For example , mutations in <unk> cause osteogenesis imperfecta type VI in humans . 
 In the absence of a required serpin , the protease that it normally would regulate is over @-@ active , leading to pathologies . Consequently , simple deficiency of a serpin ( e.g. a null mutation ) can result in disease . Gene knockouts , particularly in mice , are used experimentally to determine the normal functions of serpins by the effect of their absence . 
 = = = Specificity change = = = 
 In some rare cases , a single amino acid change in a serpin 's RCL alters its specificity to target the wrong protease . For example , the Antitrypsin @-@ Pittsburgh mutation ( <unk> ) causes the α1 @-@ antitrypsin serpin to inhibit thrombin , causing a bleeding disorder . 
 = = = <unk> and aggregation = = = 
 The majority of serpin diseases are due to protein aggregation and are termed " serpinopathies " . Serpins are vulnerable to disease @-@ causing mutations that promote formation of misfolded polymers due to their inherently unstable structures . Well @-@ characterised serpinopathies include α1 @-@ antitrypsin deficiency ( alpha @-@ 1 ) , which may cause familial emphysema and sometimes liver cirrhosis , certain familial forms of thrombosis related to antithrombin deficiency , types 1 and 2 hereditary angioedema ( <unk> ) related to deficiency of C1 @-@ inhibitor , and familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies ( <unk> ; a rare type of dementia caused by neuroserpin polymerisation ) . 
 Each monomer of the serpin aggregate exists in the inactive , relaxed conformation ( with the RCL inserted into the A @-@ sheet ) . The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases . <unk> therefore cause pathologies similarly to other <unk> ( e.g. prion diseases ) via two main mechanisms . First , the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction . Second , the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that synthesize serpins , eventually resulting in cell death and tissue damage . In the case of antitrypsin deficiency , antitrypsin polymers cause the death of liver cells , sometimes resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis . Within the cell , serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum . However , the details of how serpin polymers cause cell death remains to be fully understood . 
 Physiological serpin polymers are thought to form via domain swapping events , where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another . Domain @-@ swaps occur when mutations or environmental factors interfere with the final stages of serpin folding to the native state , causing high @-@ energy intermediates to misfold . Both dimer and trimer domain @-@ swap structures have been solved . In the dimer ( of antithrombin ) , the RCL and part of the A @-@ sheet incorporates into the A @-@ sheet of another serpin molecule . The domain @-@ swapped trimer ( of antitrypsin ) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure , the B @-@ sheet ( with each molecule 's RCL inserted into its own A @-@ sheet ) . It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain @-@ swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A @-@ sheet of another ( A @-@ sheet polymerisation ) . These domain @-@ swapped dimer and trimer structures are though to be the building blocks of the disease @-@ causing polymer aggregates , but the exact mechanism is still unclear . 
 = = = = Therapeutic strategies = = = = 
 Several therapeutic approaches are in use or under investigation to treat the most common <unk> : antitrypsin deficiency . Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency @-@ related pulmonary emphysema . In this therapy , antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously ( first marketed as <unk> ) . To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency @-@ related disease , lung and liver transplantation has proven effective . In animal models , gene targeting in induced pluripotent stem cells has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin . Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation in vitro . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 Serpins are the most widely distributed and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors . They were initially believed to be restricted to eukaryote organisms , but have since been found in bacteria , archaea and some viruses . It remains unclear whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes . Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade , whether they come from plants or animals , indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals . Exceptions include the intracellular heat shock serpin HSP47 , which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of collagen , and cycles between the cis @-@ Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum . 
 Protease @-@ inhibition is thought to be the ancestral function , with non @-@ inhibitory members the results of evolutionary <unk> of the structure . The S to R conformational change has also been adapted by some binding serpins to regulate affinity for their targets . 
 = = Distribution = =

 = = = = Human = = = = 
 The human genome encodes 16 serpin clades , termed <unk> through <unk> , including 29 inhibitory and 7 non @-@ inhibitory serpin proteins . The human serpin naming system is based upon a phylogenetic analysis of approximately 500 serpins from 2001 , with proteins named <unk> , where X is the clade of the protein and Y the number of the protein within that clade . The functions of human serpins have been determined by a combination of biochemical studies , human genetic disorders , and knockout mouse models . 
 = = = = Specialised mammalian serpins = = = = 
 Many mammalian serpins have been identified that share no obvious <unk> with a human serpin counterpart . Examples include numerous rodent serpins ( particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins ) as well as the uterine serpins . The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the <unk> gene . Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals in the Laurasiatheria clade under the influence of progesterone or estrogen . They are probably not functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the <unk> or to participate in <unk> transport . 
 = = = Insect = = = 
 The Drosophila melanogaster genome contains 29 serpin encoding genes . Amino acid sequence analysis has placed 14 of these serpins in serpin clade Q and three in serpin clade K with the remaining twelve classified as orphan serpins not belonging to any clade . The clade classification system is difficult to use for Drosophila serpins and instead a nomenclature system has been adopted that is based on the position of serpin genes on the Drosophila chromosomes . Thirteen of the Drosophila serpins occur as isolated genes in the genome ( including Serpin @-@ 27A , see below ) , with the remaining 16 organised into five gene clusters that occur at chromosome positions <unk> ( 2 serpins ) , <unk> ( 5 serpins ) , 43A ( 4 serpins ) , 77B ( 3 serpins ) and <unk> ( 2 serpins ) . 
 Studies on Drosophila serpins reveal that Serpin @-@ 27A inhibits the Easter protease ( the final protease in the Nudel , <unk> Defective , Snake and Easter proteolytic cascade ) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning . Easter functions to cleave <unk> ( a chemokine @-@ type ligand ) , which results in toll @-@ mediated signaling . As well as its central role in embryonic patterning , toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects . Accordingly , serpin @-@ 27A also functions to control the insect immune response . In Tenebrio molitor ( a large beetle ) , a protein ( <unk> ) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The genome of the nematode worm C. elegans contains 9 serpins , all of which lack signal sequences and so are likely intracellular . However , only 5 of these serpins appear to function as protease inhibitors . One , SRP @-@ 6 , performs a protective function and guards against stress @-@ induced <unk> @-@ associated lysosomal disruption . Further , SRP @-@ 6 inhibits lysosomal cysteine proteases released after lysosomal rupture . Accordingly , worms lacking SRP @-@ 6 are sensitive to stress . Most notably , SRP @-@ 6 knockout worms die when placed in water ( the hypo @-@ osmotic stress lethal phenotype or <unk> ) . It has therefore been suggested that lysosomes play a general and controllable role in determining cell fate . 
 = = = Plant = = = 
 Plant serpins were amongst the first members of the superfamily that were identified . The serpin barley protein Z is highly abundant in barley grain , and one of the major protein components in beer . The genome of the model plant , Arabidopsis thaliana contain 18 serpin @-@ like genes , although only 8 of these are full @-@ length serpin sequences . 
 Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of mammalian chymotrypsin @-@ like serine proteases in vitro , the best @-@ studied example being barley serpin <unk> ( <unk> ) , which is able to inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin as well as several blood coagulation factors . However , close relatives of chymotrypsin @-@ like serine proteases are absent in plants . The RCL of several serpins from wheat grain and rye contain poly @-@ Q repeat sequences similar to those present in the prolamin storage proteins of the endosperm . It has therefore been suggested that plant serpins may function to inhibit proteases from insects or microbes that would otherwise digest grain storage proteins . In support of this hypothesis , specific plant serpins have been identified in the phloem sap of pumpkin ( CmPS @-@ 1 ) and cucumber plants . Although an inverse correlation between up @-@ regulation of CmPS @-@ 1 expression and aphid survival was observed , in vitro feeding experiments revealed that recombinant CmPS @-@ 1 did not appear to affect insect survival . 
 Alternative roles and protease targets for plant serpins have been proposed . The Arabidopsis serpin , AtSerpin1 ( <unk> ; <unk> ​ ) , mediates set @-@ point control over programmed cell death by targeting the ' Responsive to <unk> @-@ 21 ' ( <unk> ) papain @-@ like cysteine protease . AtSerpin1 also inhibits <unk> @-@ like proteases in vitro . Two other Arabidopsis serpins , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) appear to be involved in responses to DNA damage . 
 = = = Fungal = = = 
 A single fungal serpin has been characterized to date : celpin from Piromyces spp. strain E2 . Piromyces is a genus of anaerobic fungi found in the gut of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material . <unk> is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N @-@ terminal <unk> domains in addition to its serpin domain . <unk> are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome , a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose . It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases . Certain bacterial serpins similarly localize to the cellulosome . 
 = = = Prokaryotic = = = 
 Predicted serpin genes are sporadically distributed in prokaryotes . In vitro studies on some of these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases , and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors in vivo . Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles . Accordingly , and in contrast to mammalian serpins , these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation . The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure , although Clostridium <unk> serpin <unk> to the cellulosome . It is suggested that the role of cellulosome @-@ associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome . 
 = = = Viral = = = 
 Serpins are also expressed by viruses as a way to evade the host 's immune defense . In particular , serpins expressed by pox viruses , including cow pox ( vaccinia ) and rabbit pox ( <unk> ) , are of interest because of their potential use as novel therapeutics for immune and inflammatory disorders as well as transplant therapy . <unk> suppresses the TLR @-@ mediated innate immune response and allows indefinite cardiac allograft survival in rats . <unk> and <unk> are both cross @-@ class inhibitors and target both serine ( granzyme B ; albeit weakly ) and cysteine proteases ( caspase 1 and caspase 8 ) . In comparison to their mammalian counterparts , viral serpins contain significant deletions of elements of secondary structure . Specifically , <unk> lacks the D @-@ helix as well as significant portions of the A- and E @-@ helices . 
 = Otho Holland Williams = 
 Otho Holland Williams ( March 1 , 1749 – July 15 , 1794 ) was a Continental Army officer from Maryland in the American Revolutionary War . He participated in many battles throughout the war in the New York , New Jersey and Southern theaters , eventually ending his career as a Brigadier General . 
 Born in rural Prince George 's County , Maryland , Williams spent his childhood on Springfield Farm near present @-@ day Williamsport . He was orphaned at age thirteen and was put in the care of his father 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Mr. Ross . Williams took an apprenticeship under Mr. Ross and studied his profession in the Clerk 's office of Frederick , eventually taking charge of the office . At age eighteen , Williams moved to Baltimore and undertook a similar trade . Williams returned to Frederick in 1774 and entered into a commercial life . 
 In response to Congress 's call for soldiers at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in the spring of 1775 , Williams joined a Continental Army rifle unit as a commissioned officer . Soon thereafter , he and his unit marched off to the Siege of Boston . Seeing his first significant combat action in late 1776 at the Battle of Fort Washington , Williams was captured by the British and imprisoned in New York . He was released in early 1778 and returned to the Continental Army as colonel of the 6th Maryland Regiment , a position he had acquired during his captivity . From thereafter , Williams led his regiment through much of the southern campaign , most notably in the battles of Camden , Guilford Court House , and Eutaw Springs . Near the end of the War , Williams was sent by his commanding officer General Greene with documents to Congress and was promoted to brigadier general in 1782 . 
 After the war , Williams later served as an associate justice for Baltimore County , and as the first commissioner of the Port of Baltimore . He returned to Springfield Farm in 1787 , bought the house and the surrounding land , and began laying out the town of Williamsport . In 1792 , Washington offered Williams to be Brigadier General of the Army , though he declined due to his failing health . Williams died two years later in 1794 while travelling to Sweet Springs , Virginia . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Otho Holland Williams was born on March 1 , 1749 , the third generation of his family born on the North American Continent , his ancestors having emigrated from Wales . For the first year of his life , he lived with his parents Joseph and Prudence Williams in Prince George 's County until the family settled at the mouth of the <unk> near present @-@ day Williamsport . His family home was Springfield Farm , listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 . Shortly before Joseph Williams death , he placed his thirteen @-@ year @-@ old son into the care of his brother @-@ in @-@ law <unk> who worked in the Clerk 's office in Frederick County . After studying the duties of the office , Williams took charge of the office himself before moving to Baltimore for similar employment at the age of eighteen . In the spring of 1774 , Williams returned to Frederick and entered into commercial life . 
 = = Early War = = 
 On June 14 , 1775 , upon the call for soldiers by the Continental Congress , Williams joined Capt. Thomas Price 's Independent Rifle Company of Maryland as first lieutenant . The company then marched to the Siege of Boston . Soon after the company 's arrival in Boston , Williams was promoted to the command of the company . By order of the Continental Congress on June 27 , 1776 , the rifle company was integrated into the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment , with Hugh Stephenson as colonel , Moses Rawlings as lieutenant colonel and Williams as major . 
 The regiment did not see much action until the Battle of Fort Washington , where Williams was taken prisoner by the British . He was taken to New York , where due to his rank he was permitted to go at large on his parole . During this time in New York , it was common for British officers to amuse themselves by insulting American prisoners with pointed questions such as " What Trade were you of before you entered the service ? " When a high ranking British officer asked this question of Williams he replied : 
 " That he was in a profession which taught him to resist tyranny and punish insolence , and that proofs of his profession would follow a reputation towards him . " 
 It is suggested that the officer offended by this retort informed William Phillips — then in command of the New York garrison — that Williams was sending military information to George Washington contrary to the terms of his parole . Williams was promptly arrested and confined to a sixteen square foot ( 1 @.@ 5 square meter ) room without ventilation in the city 's provost jail which he shared with Ethan Allen . Due to possible maltreatment by his captors and malnourishment , his health was affected to the point where he never fully recovered from his imprisonment . 
 After the surrender of General John Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga , Williams was exchanged on January 16 , 1778 . During his imprisonment , Williams had been promoted to colonel and given command of the 6th Maryland Regiment of the Maryland Line . Shortly after his release , he stated in a letter to the governor of Maryland that the regiment contained " ... not above a hundred effective men ... and that those are very indifferently clothed . " He further stated : " I heartily desire to join the army as soon as possible but certainly it had better be reinforced by a regiment without a colonel than by a colonel without a regiment . " After joining Washington 's army shortly before the Battle of Monmouth he learned that the regiment was noted for a looseness of discipline and was unable to stand with others in the line during battle . Soon after he took effective command , the 6th Maryland Regiment became known as the equal , if not superior , to any in the whole army . 
 = = Southern campaign = = 
 After the unsuccessful attempt to capture Savannah , Georgia , under the command of General Benjamin Lincoln , the Southern Department of the Continental Army retreated to Charleston , South Carolina . General Sir Henry Clinton moved his forces , surrounded the city where Lincoln 's army was located and cut off any chance of relief for the Continental Army . Prior to his surrender , Lincoln had been able to get messages to General Washington and Congress requesting aid . At the end of April 1780 , Washington dispatched General Johann de Kalb with 1 @,@ 400 Maryland and Delaware troops . The Maryland Line made up a large portion of this force , with Williams serving in the post of Adjutant general to General De Kalb . 
 General de Kalb 's forces took almost a month to descend the Chesapeake Bay and did not arrive in Petersburg , Virginia until the middle of June , almost a month after Lincoln had surrendered his army . The Continental Congress appointed Horatio Gates to command the Southern Department . He assumed command on July 25 , 1780 and immediately marched into South Carolina with the intent of engaging the British Army , now under the command of Charles Cornwallis . Williams served as Deputy Adjutant @-@ General under Gates . 
 = = = Battle of Camden = = = 
 After brief aggressive maneuvering which threatened the British position in the Carolinas , Cornwallis moved his forces to engage the American forces . The two armies met in the Battle of Camden on August 16 , 1780 , six miles ( 9 @.@ 5 km ) north of Camden , South Carolina . Due to several tactical errors on the part of General Gates , Cornwallis achieved a decisive victory . Deserted by their commander and facing opposition on all sides , the Continental Army was forced to retreat . During this engagement , Williams had been stationed to the rear of the army and was unable to contribute until the end and General de Kalb was mortally wounded . Prior to his death three days later , de Kalb paid a glowing tribute to the Maryland Troop under his command . 
 = = = Battle of Guilford Court House = = = 
 After the successful retreat across the Dan River , during which Williams led his men during many highly successful rear guard actions checking the enemy 's advance and baffling every British attempt to bring the American army into a general engagement , General Nathanael Greene chose to offer battle to General Cornwallis 's forces on March 15 , 1781 on ground of his own choosing at Guilford Court House , inside the city limits of present @-@ day Greensboro , North Carolina . 
 After the British forces had broken Greene 's first line made up of North Carolina Militia and the second line made up of Virginia Militia they threatened the third line made up by the 1st Maryland Regiment , under the command of Colonel John <unk> , and the 2nd Maryland Regiment . The Brigade of Guards , under the command of a Colonel Stewart , broke through the 2nd Maryland Regiment , captured two field pieces and threatened the rear of the 1st Maryland forces whom were already engaged with sizable force under the command of a Colonel Webster . 
 The 1st Maryland Regiment charged and swept Webster 's forces from the field . They then turned to face the oncoming guards unit . After a brief exchange of musket fire , in which 1st Maryland 's commander 's horse was shot from under him , the 1st Maryland Regiment charged the Guards unit who were quickly routed . 
 Greene , not able to see this part of the battle from his vantage point , had already ordered a retreat . Thus , unsupported , the Maryland troops were soon forced to withdraw . During this retreat the 6th Maryland Regiment under Williams again acted as the rear guard of the army and is credited with holding off the British forces allowing Greene to move his forces to safety . In recognition of Williams ' gallantry , Greene appointed him to the post of Adjutant general of the Army . 
 = = = Battle of Eutaw Springs = = = 
 The Battle of Eutaw Springs can be divided into two distinct engagements . During the first action , Greene had given the following order to Williams : 
 " Let Williams advance and sweep the field with his bayonets . " 
 The 6th Maryland Regiment advanced and broke the British line forcing them to fall back several miles and allowing the Continental Army to gain control of the British Camp . The Americans then began to pillage the camp which allowed time for the British to form a new line anchored by a stone house that the Continental Army was unable to move later in the day . 
 Near the close of the War , he was sent by General Greene with dispatches to congress and on May 9 , 1782 promoted to Brigadier General . 
 = = Later life = = 
 After the War , Williams returned to Maryland and settled in Baltimore . He was soon appointed Commissioner of the Port by the Governor of Maryland , an appointment that was renewed when George Washington assumed the Presidency of the United States . He was also an original member of the Maryland Society of the Cincinnati and was elected Treasurer of the National Society on November 21 , 1783 . 
 In 1786 he married his wife , Mary , the second daughter of William Smith with whom he had four sons . In the year following his marriage , Williams bought his father 's house near the Potomac River and dedicated himself to improving the farm and laying out the town of Williamsport , Maryland , which was named in his honor . Williams wanted the capital of the United States to be located in Williamsport and wrote a letter to Washington to that effect on November 1 , 1790 enclosing a map of the town . 
 Washington thought so highly of Williams that that in 1792 , when Daniel Morgan refused the rank of Brigadier General of the American Army , the president had Henry Knox , the United States Secretary of War , write Williams asking him to accept the position . The position would have made Williams the second in command of the American Army , but citing poor health and no ambition for the position , Williams declined the appointment . However , on December 21 , 1792 , Williams accepted the Maryland State Legislature 's invitation for him to serve as an Associate Justice for Baltimore County . 
 His health deteriorating , Williams was induced to try the " sea airs " and in 1793 journeyed to Barbados which afforded him some benefits . In 1794 upon reaching Woodstock on his way to Sweet Springs , Virginia Williams became too ill to travel . On Tuesday , July 15 , 1794 , at the age of 46 , Otho Holland Williams died . His remains were interred under a simple monument on the summit of a hill on his Williamsport homestead . His wife died one year later leaving their children orphaned and under the care of her father . 
 = Red Ensign of Singapore = 
 The Red Ensign of Singapore is a civil ensign used by privately owned , non @-@ military ships that are registered in Singapore . The overall design of the ensign is a modification of the national flag , with the ratio of the width to the length extended to 1 : 2 . The ensign was created by law in 1966 . The use of this ensign is regulated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore ( MPA ) . According to the MPA , the Red Ensign is the only ensign to be used on Singaporean civilian ships , and the national flag is not an acceptable substitute . The ensign must be hoisted on all Singaporean ships on entering or leaving port . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1966 , a year after Singapore 's independence from Malaysia , a document entitled Singapore Merchant Marine Ensign and numbered Misc . 5 of 1966 , was laid before Parliament on 6 September 1966 by the Deputy Prime Minister . The document created a civil ensign that was to be used on ships registered in Singapore . The Red Ensign has been in use since then . 
 = = Design = = 
 According to the Parliamentary paper Misc . 5 of 1966 , the background of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two . In contrast , the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three . In the centre of the ensign is a white ring , which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white . The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle . The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag , although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather than to the left of the stars . According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore ( MPA ) , the red colour of the civil ensign is the same as that of the national flag . The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032 .

 The MPA 's 1999 circular includes a construction sheet with detailed dimensions for the manufacture of the flag . The sheet is in inches and centimetres . The overall dimensions of the flag are 36 inches ( 91 @.@ 44 cm ) by 72 inches ( 182 @.@ 88 cm ) . The space between the top of the ensign to the top of the ring , and the bottom of the ring to the bottom of the ensign , is 9 @.@ 7 inches ( 24 @.@ 64 cm ) . The outer diameter of the ring is 16 @.@ 6 inches ( 42 @.@ 16 cm ) , and the ring itself is 0 @.@ 95 inches ( 2 @.@ 41 cm ) in thickness .

Under section 37 of the Act , if a Singapore ship fails to hoist the Red Ensign on entering or leaving any port , the ship master may be fined up to $ 1 @,@ 000 . 
 The MPA 's 1999 circular calls the attention of owners , masters and officers of Singapore ships to sections 36 and 37 of the Merchant Shipping Act . In particular , paragraph 3 of the circular points out that " the Singapore national flag does not [ substitute ] the Red Ensign " . 
 = Hurricane Fernanda ( 1993 ) = 
 Hurricane Fernanda in 1993 was the first significant hurricane threat to Hawaii since Hurricane Iniki struck in September 1992 . The seventh named storm and fourth major hurricane of the 1993 Pacific hurricane season , Fernanda developed on August 9 off the coast of Mexico from a tropical wave . Throughout its life , it was a large system , and the hurricane reached peak winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) . After weakening slightly , Fernanda restrengthened and was expected to move across the Hawaiian Islands . Instead , the hurricane slowed its forward motion and turned away from the state , although it still produced high waves along the eastern shore of the islands . Several homes were damaged , and the surf damaged coastal roads . The storm also contributed to rainfall across the state , and minor flooding occurred in Kauai . Fernanda became extratropical on August 19 , and after turning to the northeast became absorbed by a cold front . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Fernanda origins were as a tropical wave that was first observed in the deep Atlantic Ocean on July 28 . It moved across the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea , and developed an area of thunderstorms to the south of Panama on August 4 . The system gradually organized as it continued westward , and on August 9 , it developed into Tropical Depression Seven @-@ E about 400 miles south of Manzanillo , Colima . Upon being classified , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) described the depression as " a large monsoon @-@ like system " , with abundant convection and well @-@ defined upper @-@ level outflow . With a ridge to its north , the depression tracked steadily west @-@ northwestward , and gradual strengthening was expected . 
 Within 12 hours of forming , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fernanda . Banding features increased , and outflow became well @-@ established throughout the storm . Fernanda intensified further and attained hurricane status late on August 10 . Soon after , a large eye became evident on satellite imagery , which became more distinct and organized . The hurricane subsequently underwent rapid intensification , and by August 12 , Fernanda reached peak winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) ; at that time , it was a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , and was located about 1070 miles ( 1725 km ) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . The peak winds were based on estimates from the Dvorak technique . After maintaining peak winds for about 18 hours , the hurricane began a slow weakening trend . By August 14 , the eye had become less distinct as the storm moved over cooler waters , while winds decreased to below major hurricane status , or Category 3 intensity . At that time , the NHC forecast Fernanda to decelerate and turn to the northwest , although the possibility of a more westward track toward Hawaii was noted . 
 On August 14 , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center ( CPHC ) took over issuing warnings on the hurricane , as Fernanda crossed 140 ° W into their area of responsibility . After maintaining a west @-@ northwest track for much of its duration , the hurricane turned more toward the west . By August 15 , the storm was expected to pass between Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii ; however , the CPHC noted uncertainty due to an approaching upper @-@ level trough , which would produce a more northerly tack . Its winds weakened to about 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) , although late on August 15 the hurricane re @-@ intensified to winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . By that time , it had redeveloped a large eye of 50 miles in diameter ; wind gusted to 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) , while tropical storm force winds extended 200 miles ( 640 km ) from the center . Hurricane Hunters flew into the hurricane to provide observational data while it was near Hawaii . 
 Early on August 16 , Hurricane Fernanda was expected to continue westward and bring hurricane @-@ force winds to the Big Island of Hawaii . By later in the day , however , it slowed significantly due to the approaching trough to its north . Hurricane Fernanda made its closest approach to Hawaii early on August 17 , when it was 305 miles ( 490 km ) east @-@ northeast of the island of Hawaii . It began its definitive motion toward the northwest and began weakening due to increasing wind shear . Later on August 17 , Fernanda weakened to tropical storm strength , by which time convection was largely removed from the circulation . On August 19 , the storm transitioned into an extratropical storm , and advisories were discontinued . The remnants of Fernanda turned to the northeast , and on August 21 an approaching cold front absorbed the circulation off the coast of Washington . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Early on August 15 , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center ( CPHC ) issued a tropical storm watch for the Big Island of Hawaii , meaning gale force winds were possible within 36 hours ; concurrently , a high surf advisory was put into effect for all eastward facing shorelines . By late on August 15 , the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for the entire state of Hawaii . Early the next day , the CPHC upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the Big Island of Hawaii , as Fernanda was expected to continue its westward track . When the hurricane slowed , its movement was uncertain , although all watches and warnings were canceled by August 17 , when Fernanda began its northwest track . Officials opened nine shelters on the Big Island , and about 200 people stayed in them until the hurricane watches were canceled . One shelter near Hilo held 80 people due to concern of the high waves . Officials on the Big Island closed and evacuated all of the beach parks on August 15 . On Molokai , 40 hikers were evacuated from a valley prone to flooding . Residents bought emergency supplies on Kauai , which had been struck by powerful Hurricane Iniki 11 months prior . 
 While moving slowly for a few days , Hurricane Fernanda produced high surf along the eastern shores of the Hawaiian Islands . The rough waves prompted the closure of several beaches in Maui and the Big Island . Wave heights reached 10 to 15 feet ( 3 to 4 @.@ 5 m ) in most places , while portions of Maui experienced up to 20 foot ( 6 m ) waves . The surf damaged coastal roads along most of the islands , and some homes were flooded . One home in Maui was moved several feet off of its foundation due to the waves . In the harbor at Hilo , one boat was damaged and another was destroyed , and in the Puna district , 12 homes were damaged . Although the hurricane remained away from the islands , moisture from Fernanda combined with an upper @-@ level trough to produce rainfall across the state . Precipitation was heaviest in Kauai , where some minor flooding was reported . After Fernanda became extratropical in the shipping lanes of the north Pacific , several vessels reported gale force winds .

The route serves as an important connector between the Garden State Parkway to the west and Route 18 and Asbury Park to the east . It runs concurrent with County Route 16 from Bowne / Wayside Roads to the eastern terminus at Route 35 . Route 66 , which varies from a two @-@ lane undivided road to a four @-@ lane divided highway , passes through commercial areas for most of its length with some wooded areas . The route was created in 1953 , replacing what had been Route 33 @-@ 35 Link .

Past this interchange , the route heads into commercial areas , where it widens into a four @-@ lane divided highway that passes south of the Jersey Shore Premium Outlets , with an interchange serving the outlet mall at Premium Outlets Boulevard / <unk> Boulevard . Following this , the road heads into Neptune Township . After the intersection with Jumping Brook Road , the divided highway ends and Route 66 becomes a two @-@ lane undivided road . The route heads through a patch of woods before passing more businesses and coming to an intersection with County Route 16 ( Asbury Avenue ) . Here , the road becomes a four @-@ lane divided highway again and heads east along the border of Ocean Township to the north and Neptune Township to the south , concurrent with County Route 16 . It passes through woodland before coming to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 18 . Past Route 18 , the road heads into commercial areas again , with the Seaview Square Shopping Center located to the north of the route . Route 66 ends at the Asbury Park Circle with Route 35 , where County Route 16 continues east toward Asbury Park on Asbury Avenue .

 Route 66 was legislated in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering to replace what had been Route 33 @-@ 35 Link . There is a proposal to widen the two @-@ lane portions of Route 66 between Jumping Brook Road and Wayside Road . The need for this widening is due to the need to handle traffic going to Asbury Park in the summer months as well as an evacuation route for the coastal regions of Monmouth County , and the poor design of the current roadway , which lacks turning lanes and facilities for bicycles and pedestrians . In addition , a proposed outlet mall called the Jersey Shore Premium Outlets was planned along the route in Tinton Falls , with improvements planned to the route in the vicinity of the project including an overpass to the outlet mall . In 2006 , Neptune Township refused to cooperate with these plans because the original agreement for the outlet mall project in 2001 was no longer up to date with the current traffic demands . Despite this opposition , the plans were approved by the borough of Tinton Falls in 2007 and the Jersey Shore Premium Outlets opened in November 2008 . As for the widening of Route 66 , a meeting was held in August 2009 between members of the 11th state Legislative district and the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation .

 = Tropical Storm Bonnie ( 2004 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Bonnie was a small tropical storm that made landfall on Florida in August 2004 . The second storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season , Bonnie developed from a tropical wave on August 3 to the east of the Lesser Antilles . After moving through the islands , its fast forward motion caused it to dissipate . However , it later regenerated into a tropical storm near the Yucatán Peninsula . Bonnie attained peak winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) over the Gulf of Mexico , turned to the northeast , and hit Florida as a 45 mph ( 75 km ) tropical storm . The storm accelerated to the northeast and became an extratropical cyclone to the east of New Jersey . Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall on Florida in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season , and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August . 
 Bonnie 's impact was minimal . Throughout the Caribbean Sea , the storm 's effects consisted primarily of light rainfall , and in Florida , the precipitation caused flooding and minor damage . The tropical storm caused a tornado outbreak across the Southeastern United States which killed three people and inflicted over $ 1 million ( 2004 USD ) in damage . Bonnie made landfall in Florida the day before Hurricane Charley struck . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Bonnie were in a tropical wave that emerged from the coast of Africa on July 29 and entered the Atlantic Ocean . It moved westward , attaining convection and a mid @-@ level circulation . Convection steadily increased , and , upon the development of a low @-@ level circulation center , the system organized into Tropical Depression Two on August 3 while 415 miles ( 670 km ) east of Barbados . It moved rapidly westward at speeds of up to 23 mph ( 37 km / h ) ; after crossing through the Lesser Antilles on August 4 , it degenerated back into a tropical wave . 
 The tropical wave continued to move rapidly to the west @-@ northwest , until it reached the western Caribbean Sea . While south of Cuba and through the Cayman Islands , the system slowed down to regenerate convection , and it re @-@ developed into a tropical depression on August 8 . Operationally , the system was classified a tropical wave until a day later . The depression moved through the Yucatán Channel , and intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie on August 9 while 70 miles ( 115 km ) north of the Yucatán Peninsula . 
 Bonnie continued to the west @-@ northwest ; late on August 9 , the storm presented a 9 @-@ mile ( 15 @-@ km ) wide eyewall , a very unusual occurrence in a small and weak tropical storm . Bonnie quickly strengthened while turning to the north , a directional shift caused by a break in the mid @-@ level ridge . The storm briefly weakened late on August 10 ; it re @-@ strengthened again the following day to attain a peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . Soon after , strong southwesterly wind shear disrupted the storm , causing Bonnie to weaken again . On August 12 , Bonnie made landfall just south of Apalachicola as a 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) tropical storm . It quickly weakened to a tropical depression , and accelerated northeastward through the southeastern United States . After paralleling the Georgia , South Carolina , and North Carolina coastlines , Bonnie lost its tropical characteristics on August 14 to the east of New Jersey . Its remnant low continued northeastward , making landfall in Massachusetts and Maine and continuing into Atlantic Canada . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 About 16 hours before the storm moved through the Lesser Antilles , the government of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning . Guadeloupe , Martinique , Dominica , St. Maarten , Saba , St. Eustatius , Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches . 
 Combined with the threat of Hurricane Charley , Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154 oil platforms and 32 oil rigs . The cease in production was equivalent to over 1 @.@ 2 million barrels of loss in crude oil , or 0 @.@ 2 % of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico . Natural gas reserves were also limited . The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7 @.@ 4 % of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico . 
 Early forecasts suggested that Bonnie would attain 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) winds , or Category 1 status . In response to the threat , 15 shelters in 7 northwestern Florida counties were put on standby . In the hours prior to landfall , 2 shelters were opened , 4 were put on standby , and health and cleanup teams were deployed to the area . Parts of Gadsden , Wakulla , and Levy Counties issued voluntary evacuations , and numerous schools were closed .

 As a tropical depression , the storm moved rapidly through the Lesser Antilles ; consequently , most islands only experienced minor effects . For example , Saint Lucia received light and sporadic rain showers , accompanied by sustained winds of 20 – 25 mph ( 32 – 40 km / h ) and gusts to 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , however , the depression dropped up to 9 @.@ 2 inches ( 235 mm ) of rain in 24 hours . The rainfall blocked storm drains , including those near the airport , which was forced to shut down . The rainfall caused debris to collect on roads throughout the island . Although the storm passed just 70 miles ( 110 km ) north of the Yucatán Peninsula , the storm dropped only 0 @.@ 6 inches ( 15 mm ) of rain due to its small size .

 In Florida , Bonnie produced up to 4 @.@ 1 inches ( 104 mm ) of rainfall in Pace , with peak wind gusts of 42 mph ( 68 km / h ) . Bonnie was accompanied by a 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) storm surge ; moderate wave action caused slight beach erosion . Rainfall and storm surge flooded roads , forcing the evacuation of 2 @,@ 000 residents in Taylor County . The winds downed trees and caused scattered power outages . A tornado in Jacksonville damaged several businesses and houses . 
 Bonnie triggered a tornado outbreak throughout portions of the Mid @-@ Atlantic states . One tornado in Pender County , North Carolina destroyed 17 homes and damaged 59 houses , causing three deaths and $ 1 @.@ 27 million in damage ( 2004 USD ) . In Stella , Bonnie generated a waterspout that struck a campground , damaged nine trailers , and wrecked small boats . A tornado in <unk> damaged several houses as well . In South Carolina , tornadoes across the state damaged nine homes . A suspected tornado in Danville , Virginia destroyed the roofs of several businesses . In South Carolina , rainfall peaking at 6 @.@ 07 inches ( 154 mm ) in Loris caused flooding across the state . The flooding , including a one @-@ foot depth along U.S. Route 501 , washed away a road and a bridge in Greenville County . In addition , 600 people across the state were left without electricity . 
 In Pennsylvania , the remnants of the storm dropped up to 8 inches ( 200 mm ) of rain in <unk> . The rainfall caused the Schuylkill River to reach a crest peak of 12 @.@ 89 ft ( 4 m ) at Berne . The flooding blocked several roads across eastern Pennsylvania . In addition , Bonnie produced gusty winds , leaving thousands without power . In Delaware , the storm dropped up to 4 inches ( 100 mm ) of rain , forcing 100 to evacuate from the floodwaters . The flooding closed part of U.S. Route 13 , and an overflown creek in New Castle County caused moderate flooding damage to stores . In Maine , moisture from the remnants of Bonnie produced heavy rainfall , with localized totals of up to 10 inches ( 250 mm ) . The rainfall flooded or washed out roads across the eastern portion of the state . In Aroostook County , near the town of St. Francis , the rainfall caused a mudslide which narrowed a county road to one lane . 
 As an extratropical low combined with a frontal system , Bonnie continued to produce moderate rainfall in Canada , peaking at 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 90 mm ) in Edmundston , New Brunswick . The rainfall caused basement flooding and road washouts ; slick roads caused a traffic fatality in Edmundston .

 Twenty @-@ two hours after Bonnie struck Florida , Hurricane Charley passed over the Dry Tortugas . This was the first time in recorded history that two tropical storms struck Florida within 1 day . Previously , Hurricane Gordon and Tropical Storm Helene struck the state within five days of each other in September 2000 . Originally , it was thought that two storms in the 1906 season hit the state within 12 hours ; however , the suspected tropical storm was determined to be a tropical depression in a more recent analysis . Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall in Florida during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season , and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August . 
 Because Bonnie hit Florida immediately before Charley , damage between the two storms was often difficult to differentiate . President George W. Bush responded to the storm by declaring much of Florida a Federal Disaster Area on August 13 , 2004 . 
 = Mariah Carey = 
 Mariah Carey ( born March 27 , 1969 or 1970 ) is an American singer , songwriter , record producer , and actress . In 1990 , she rose to fame with the release of " Vision of Love " from her eponymous debut album . The album produced four chart @-@ topping singles in the US and began what would become a string of commercially successful albums which solidified the singer as Columbia 's highest selling act . Carey and Boyz II Men spent a record sixteen weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in 1995 @-@ 96 with " One Sweet Day " , which remains the longest @-@ running number @-@ one song in US chart history . Following a contentious divorce from Sony Music head Tommy Mottola , Carey adopted a new image and traversed towards hip hop with the release of Butterfly ( 1997 ) . In 1998 , she was honored as the world 's best @-@ selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards and subsequently named the best @-@ selling female artist of the millennium in 2000 . 
 Carey parted with Columbia in 2000 , and signed a record @-@ breaking $ 100 million recording contract with Virgin Records America . In the weeks prior to the release of her film Glitter and its accompanying soundtrack in 2001 , she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion . The project was poorly received and led to a general decline in the singer 's career . Carey 's recording contract was bought out for $ 50 million by Virgin and she signed a multi @-@ million dollar deal with Island Records the following year . After a relatively unsuccessful period , she returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) . The album became the best @-@ selling album in the US and the second best @-@ seller worldwide in 2005 and produced " We Belong Together " , which became her most successful single of the 2000s , and was later named " Song of the Decade " by Billboard . Carey once again ventured into film with a well @-@ received supporting role in Precious ( 2009 ) , and was awarded the " Breakthrough Performance Award " at the Palm Springs International Film Festival . 
 Throughout her career , Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide , making her one of the best @-@ selling music artists of all time . According to the RIAA , she is the third @-@ best @-@ selling female artist in the United States , with 63 @.@ 5 million certified albums . With the release of " Touch My Body " ( 2008 ) , Carey gained her 18th number @-@ one single in the United States , more than any other solo artist . In 2012 , the singer was ranked second on VH1 's list of the " 100 Greatest Women in Music " . Aside from her commercial accomplishments , Carey has won 5 Grammy Awards , 19 World Music Awards , 11 American Music Awards , and 14 Billboard Music Awards and has been consistently credited with inspiring a generation of singers . Referred to as the " songbird supreme " by the Guinness World Records , she is famed for her five @-@ octave vocal range , power , melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Mariah Carey was born in Huntington , New York . Her father , Alfred Roy Carey , was of African American and Afro @-@ Venezuelan descent , while her mother , Patricia ( née Hickey ) , is of Irish descent . The last name Carey was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather , Francisco Núñez , after immigrating to New York . Patricia was an occasional opera singer and vocal coach before she met Alfred in 1960 . As he began earning a living as an aeronautical engineer , the couple wed later that year , and moved into a small suburb in New York . After their elopement , Patricia 's family disowned her due to her marrying a black man . Carey later explained that growing up , she felt a notion of neglect from her maternal family , a mark that affected her greatly . During the years between the births of Carey 's older sister Alison and herself , the Carey family struggled within the community due to their ethnicity . Carey 's name was derived from the song " They Call the Wind Maria " , originally from the 1951 Broadway musical Paint Your Wagon . When Carey was three , her parents divorced . 
 After their separation , Alison moved in with her father , while the other two children , Mariah and brother Morgan , remained with their mother . Carey would grow apart from her father , and would later stop seeing him altogether . By the age of four , Carey recalled that she had begun to sneak the radio under her covers at night , and just sing and try to find peace within the music . During elementary school , she excelled in subjects that she enjoyed , such as music , art , and literature , but did not find interest in others . After several years of financial struggles , Patricia earned enough money to move her family into a stable and more affluent sector in New York . Carey had begun writing poems and adding melodies to them , thus starting as a singer @-@ songwriter while attending <unk> High School in Greenlawn , New York , where she graduated in 1987 . Carey excelled in her music , and demonstrated usage of the whistle register , though only beginning to master and control it through her training with her mother . Though introducing her daughter to classical opera , Patricia never pressured her to pursue a career in it , as she never seemed interested . Carey recalled that she kept her singer @-@ songwriter works a secret and noted that Patricia had " never been a pushy mom . She never said , ' Give it more of an operatic feel ' . I respect opera like crazy , but it didn 't influence me . " 
 While in high school , Carey began writing songs with Gavin Christopher . They needed an assistant who could play the keyboard : " We called someone and he couldn 't come , so by accident we stumbled upon Ben [ Margulies ] . Ben came to the studio , and he really couldn 't play the keyboards very well — he was really more of a drummer — but after that day , we kept in touch , and we sort of clicked as writers . " Carey and Christopher began writing and composing songs in the basement of his father 's store during Carey 's senior year . After composing their first song together , " Here We Go Round Again " , which Carey described as having a Motown vibe , they continued writing material for a full @-@ length demo . She began living in a one @-@ bedroom apartment in Manhattan , which she shared with four other female students . Carey worked as a waitress for various restaurants , usually getting fired after two weeks . While requiring work to pay for her rent , Carey still had musical ambitions , as she continued working late into the night with Margulies in hopes of completing a demo . After completing her four song demo tape , Carey attempted to pass it to music labels , but failed each time . Shortly thereafter , she was introduced to rising pop singer Brenda K. Starr .

 As Starr 's friendship with Carey grew , so did her interest in helping Carey succeed in the industry . In December 1988 , Carey accompanied Starr to a record executives ' gala , where she handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records , Tommy Mottola , who listened to it on his way back home . After the first two songs , he was interested in her ; later , after searching for Carey for two weeks , he immediately signed her and began mapping out her commercial debut . While she maintained that she wanted to continue working with Margulies , Mottola enlisted top producers of the time , including Ric Wake , Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence . Mottola and the staff at Columbia had planned to market Carey as their main female pop artist , competing with Whitney Houston and Madonna ( signed to Arista and Sire Records respectively ) . After the completion of her debut album , Mariah Carey , Columbia spent more than $ 1 million promoting it . Despite a weak start , the album eventually reached the top of the Billboard 200 , after Carey 's exposure at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards . Mariah Carey stayed atop the charts for eleven consecutive weeks , and she won the Best New Artist , and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance awards for her single " Vision of Love " . In addition to " Vision of Love " , the album yielded the Billboard Hot 100 number one singles " Love Takes Time " , " Someday " , and " I Don 't Wanna Cry " . Carey became the first artist since The Jackson 5 to have its first four singles reach number one . Mariah Carey finished as the best @-@ selling album in the United States in 1991 , while totaling sales of over 15 million copies . 
 Carey began recording her second studio album , Emotions , in 1991 . She described it as a homage to Motown soul music , as she felt the need to pay tribute to the type of music that had influenced her as a child . For the project , Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff , who only had a small role on her debut , as well as Robert Clivillés and David Cole , from the dance group C + C Music Factory . Carey 's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a personal contract Carey had signed with him before signing the record deal with Columbia , agreeing to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs , but half of her earnings as well . However , when the time came to write music for Emotions , Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co @-@ writers on an album . Margulies later filed a lawsuit against Sony which ultimately led to their parting of ways . Emotions was released on September 17 , 1991 , and was accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor . While praised for Carey 's improved songwriting , production , and new sound , the album was criticized for its material , thought weaker than that of her debut . Though the album managed sales of over eight million copies globally , Emotions failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor . 
 As after the release of her debut , critics again questioned whether Carey would embark on a world tour to promote her material . Although Carey explained that stage fright and the style of her songs made a tour very daunting , speculation grew that Carey was a " studio worm " , and that she was incapable of producing the perfect pitch and 5 @-@ octave vocal range for which she was known . In hopes of putting to rest any claims of her being a manufactured artist , Carey and Walter Afanasieff decided to book an appearance on MTV Unplugged , a television program aired by MTV . The show presented name artists " unplugged " or stripped of studio equipment . While Carey favored her more soulful and powerful songs , it was decided that her most popular content would be included . Days before the show 's taping , Carey and Afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song , in order to provide something different and unexpected . They chose " I 'll Be There " , a song made popular by The Jackson 5 in 1970 . On March 16 , 1992 , Carey recorded a seven @-@ piece set @-@ list at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens , New York . The revue was met with critical acclaim , leading to it being aired more than three times as often as an average episode would . The success tempted Sony officials to market it . Sony decided to release it as an EP , priced low because it was short . The EP proved to be a success , contrary to critics and speculations that Carey was just a studio artist , and was given a triple @-@ Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , and managed Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets . 
 = = = 1993 – 96 : Music Box and Daydream = = = 
 During early 1993 , Carey began working on her third studio album , Music Box . After Emotions failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album , Carey and Columbia came to the agreement that the next album would contain a more pop influenced sound , in order to appeal to a wider audience . During Carey 's writing sessions , she began working mostly with Afanasieff , with whom she co @-@ wrote and produced most of Music Box . On August 31 , Music Box was released around the world , debuting at number @-@ one on the Billboard 200 . The album was met with mixed reception from music critics ; while many praised the album 's pop influence and strong content , others felt that Carey made less usage of her acclaimed vocal range . Ron Wynn from AllMusic described Carey 's different form of singing on the album : " It was wise for Carey to display other elements of her approach , but sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion . " The album 's second single , " Hero " , would eventually come to be one of Carey 's most popular and inspirational songs of her career . The song became Carey 's eighth chart topper in the United States , and began expanding Carey 's popularity throughout Europe . With the release of the album 's third single , Carey achieved several career milestones . Her cover of Badfinger 's " Without You " became her first number one single in Germany , Sweden , and the United Kingdom . 
 Music Box spent prolonged periods at number one on the album charts of several countries , and eventually became one of the best @-@ selling albums of all time , with worldwide sales of over 32 million copies . After declining to tour for her past two albums , Carey agreed to embark on a short stateside string of concerts , titled the Music Box Tour . Spanning only six dates across North America , the short but successful tour was a large step for Carey , who dreaded the hassle of touring . Following Music Box , Carey took a relatively large period of time away from the public eye , and began working on an unknown project throughout 1994 . In October 1994 , Billboard announced that Carey would release a holiday album later that year . That 1994 , Carey recorded a duet with Luther Vandross ; a cover of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross 's " Endless Love " . Carey 's album Merry Christmas was released on November 1 , 1994 , on the same day that the album 's first single , " All I Want for Christmas Is You " , was released . The album eventually became the best @-@ selling Christmas album of all time , with global sales reaching over 15 million copies . Additionally , " All I Want for Christmas Is You " was critically lauded , and is considered " one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon . " Rolling Stone described it as a " holiday standard " , and ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list . Commercially , it became the best @-@ selling holiday ringtone of all time , and the best @-@ selling single by a non @-@ Asian artist in Japan , selling over 2 @.@ 1 million units ( both ringtone and digital download ) . By the end of the holiday season of 1994 , Carey and Afanasieff had already begun writing material for her next studio album , which would be released late the following year . 
 Released on October 3 , 1995 , Daydream combined the pop sensibilities of Music Box with downbeat R & B and hip hop influences . The album 's second single , " One Sweet Day " was inspired by the death of David Cole . The song remained atop the Hot 100 for a record @-@ holding 16 weeks , and became the longest @-@ running number @-@ one song in history . Daydream became her biggest @-@ selling album in the United States , and became her second album to be certified Diamond by the RIAA , following Music Box . The album again was the best @-@ seller by an international artist in Japan , shipping over 2 @.@ 2 million copies , and eventually reaching global sales of over 25 million units . Critically , the album was heralded as Carey 's best to date ; The New York Times named it one of 1995 's best albums , and wrote , " best cuts bring R & B candy @-@ making to a new peak of textural refinement [ ... ] Carey 's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed , sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés . " Carey once again opted to embark on a short world tour titled Daydream World Tour . It had seven dates , three in Japan and four throughout Europe . When tickets went on sale , Carey set records when all 150 @,@ 000 tickets for her three shows at Japan 's largest stadium , Tokyo Dome , sold out in under three hours , breaking the previous record held by The Rolling Stones . Due to the album 's success , Carey won two awards at the American Music Awards for her solo efforts : Favorite Pop / Rock Female Artist and Favorite Soul / R & B Female Artist . Daydream and its singles were respectively nominated in six categories at the 38th Grammy Awards . Carey , along with Boyz II Men , opened the event with a performance of " One Sweet Day " . However , Carey did not receive any award , prompting her to comment " What can you do ? I will never be disappointed again . After I sat through the whole show and didn 't win once , I can handle anything . " In 1995 , due to Daydream 's enormous Japanese sales , Billboard declared Carey the " Overseas Artist of the Year " in Japan . 
 = = = 1997 – 2000 : New image and independence , Butterfly , and Rainbow = = = 
 With her following albums , Carey began to take more initiative and control with her music , and started infusing more genres into her work . For Butterfly , she sought to work with other producers and writers other than Afanasieff , such as Sean Combs , Kamaal Fareed , Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters . During the album 's recording , Carey and Mottola separated , with Carey citing it as her way of achieving freedom , and a new lease on life . Aside from the album 's different approach , critics took notice of Carey 's altered style of singing , which she described as breathy vocals . Her new @-@ found style of singing was met with mixed reception ; some critics felt this was a sign of maturity , that she did not feel the need to always show off her upper range , while others felt it was a sign of her weakening and waning voice . The album 's lead single , " Honey " , and its accompanying music video , introduced a more overtly sexual image than Carey had ever demonstrated , and furthered reports of her freedom from Mottola . Carey believed that her image was not " that much of a departure from what I 've done in the past [ ... ] It 's not like I went psycho and thought I would be a rapper . Personally , this album is about doing whatever the hell I wanted to do . " Reviews for Butterfly were generally positive : Rolling Stone wrote , " It 's not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine , Houston @-@ style balladry [ ... ] but the predominant mood of ' Butterfly ' is one of coolly erotic reverie . " AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey 's vocals as " sultrier and more controlled than ever " , and heralded Butterfly as one of her " best records and illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music , which makes her a rarity among her ' 90s peers . ' " The album was a commercial success , although not to the degree of her previous albums Mariah Carey , Music Box and Daydream . 
 Carey began developing other projects during the late 1990s . On April 14 , 1998 , Carey partook in the VH1 Divas benefit concert , where she sang alongside Aretha Franklin , Celine Dion , Shania Twain , Gloria Estefan , and Carole King . Carey had begun developing a film project All That Glitters , later re @-@ titled to simply Glitter , and wrote songs for other projects , such as Men in Black ( 1997 ) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas ( 2000 ) . After Glitter fell into developmental hell , Carey postponed the project , and began writing material for a new album . Sony Music executives wanted her to prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the holiday season . They wanted to release an album that featured her number one singles in the United States , and her international chart toppers on the European versions , without any new material , while Carey felt that a compilation album should reflect on her most personal songs , not just her most commercial . The album , titled # 1 's ( 1998 ) , featured a duet with Whitney Houston , " When You Believe " , which was included on the soundtrack for The Prince of Egypt ( 1998 ) . # 1 's became a phenomenon in Japan , selling over one million copies in its opening week , making Carey as the only international artist to accomplish this feat . It sold over 3 @.@ 25 million copies in Japan after only the first three months , and holds the record as the best @-@ selling album by a non @-@ Asian artist . 
 During the spring of 1999 , Carey began working on the final album per her record contract with Sony . But due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had developed with Sony , she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999 , quicker than any of her other albums . Titled Rainbow ( 1999 ) , the album found Carey once again working with a new array of music producers and songwriters , such as Jay @-@ Z and DJ Clue ? . Carey also wrote two ballads with David Foster and Diane Warren , whom she used to replace Afanasieff . Rainbow was released on November 2 , 1999 , to the highest first week sales of her career at the time , however debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 . In the meantime Carey 's troubled relationship with Columbia grew , as they halted promotion after the album 's first two singles . They felt Rainbow didn 't have any strong single to be released , whereas Carey wanted to release a ballad . This led to a very public feud , as Carey began posting messages on her website , telling fans inside information on the dispute , as well as instructing them to request " Can 't Take That Away ( Mariah 's Theme ) " on radio stations . The song was ultimately released but Carey found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low @-@ promotion release , which made it commercially non @-@ viable . Critical reception of Rainbow was generally enthusiastic , with the Sunday Herald saying that the album " sees her impressively tottering between soul ballads and collaborations with R & B heavyweights like Snoop Doggy Dogg and Usher [ ... ] It 's a polished collection of pop @-@ soul . " Though a commercial success , Rainbow became Carey 's lowest selling album to that point in her career .

 After she received Billboard 's Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best @-@ Selling Female Artist of the Millennium , Carey parted from Columbia and signed a $ 100 million five @-@ album recording contract with Virgin Records America ( EMI Records ) in April 2001 . Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project . She opted to record an album partly mixed with 1980s influenced disco and other similar genres , in order to go hand @-@ in @-@ hand with the film 's setting . She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity , with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives . Just a few months later , in July 2001 , it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown . She had left messages on her website that complained of being overworked , and her three @-@ year relationship with the singer Luis Miguel ended . In an interview the following year , she said , " I was with people who didn 't really know me and I had no personal assistant . I 'd do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night , if that . " Due to the pressure from the media , her heavy work schedule and the split from Miguel , Carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website , and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings . On July 19 , 2001 , Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live ( TRL ) . As the show 's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break , Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men 's shirt , and began a striptease , in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble . While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance , Carey 's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention . Only days later , Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website : " I 'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don 't feel that I should be doing music right now . What I 'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video . All I really want is [ to ] just be me and that 's what I should have done in the first place ... I don 't say this much but guess what , I don 't take care of myself . " Following the quick removal of the messages , Berger commented that Carey had been " obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly " when she posted the letters . 
 On July 26 , she was suddenly hospitalized , citing " extreme exhaustion " and a " physical and emotional breakdown " . Carey was inducted at an un @-@ disclosed hospital in Connecticut , and remained hospitalized and under doctor 's care for two weeks , followed by an extended absence from the public . Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey 's publicized breakdown and hospitalization , Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter , as well as its soundtrack of the same name . When discussing the project 's weak commercial reaction , Carey blamed both her frame of mind during the time of its release , its postponement , as well as the soundtrack having been released on September 11 . Critics panned Glitter , as well as its accompanying soundtrack ; both were unsuccessful commercially . The accompanying soundtrack album , Glitter , became Carey 's lowest @-@ selling album to that point . The St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch dismissed it as " an absolute mess that 'll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that , while not always critically heralded , was at least nearly consistently successful . " Following the negative cloud that was enveloping Carey 's personal life at the time , as well as the project 's poor reception , her $ 100 million five @-@ album record deal with Virgin Records America ( EMI Records ) was bought out for $ 50 million . Soon after , Carey flew to Capri , Italy for a period of five months , in which she began writing material for her new album , stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year . Carey later said that her time at Virgin was " a complete and total stress @-@ fest [ ... ] I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money . I learned a big lesson from that . " Later that year , she signed a contract with Island Records , valued at more than $ 24 million , and launched the record label MonarC . To add further to Carey 's emotional burdens , her father , with whom she had little contact since childhood , died of cancer that year . 
 In 2002 , Carey was cast in the independent film , <unk> , alongside Mira Sorvino and Melora Walters , who co @-@ starred as waitresses at a mobster @-@ operated restaurant . It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival , and received generally negative critical response , though Carey 's portrayal of the character was praised ; Roger Friedman of Fox News referred to her as " a Thelma Ritter for the new millennium " , and wrote , " Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs " . Later that year , Carey performed the American national anthem to rave reviews at the Super Bowl XXXVI at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans , Louisiana . Towards the end of 2002 , Carey released her next studio album Charmbracelet , which she said marked " a new lease on life " for her . Though released in the wake of Glitter and Carey 's return to the music scene , sales of Charmbracelet were moderate and the quality of Carey 's vocals came under criticism . Joan Anderson from The Boston Globe declared the album " the worst of her career , and revealed a voice [ that is ] no longer capable of either gravity @-@ defying gymnastics or soft coos " , while AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine expressed similar sentiments and wrote , " What is a greater problem is that Mariah 's voice is shot , sounding in tatters throughout the record . She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity @-@ defying vocal runs . " 
 In April 2003 , Carey announced she would be touring later in the year . The Charmbracelet World Tour : An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey , spanned North America and East Asia over three months , generally playing in smaller venues rather than arenas . Throughout the United States , the shows were done in theaters , and something more Broadway @-@ influenced , " It 's much more intimate so you 'll feel like you had an experience . You experience a night with me . " However , while smaller productions were booked throughout the tour 's stateside leg , Carey performed at stadiums in Asia and Europe , performing for a crowd of over 35 @,@ 000 in Manila , 50 @,@ 000 in Malaysia , and to over 70 @,@ 000 people in China . In the United Kingdom , it became Carey 's first tour to feature shows outside London , booking arena stops in Glasgow , Birmingham and Manchester . Charmbracelet World Tour : An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey garnered generally positive reviews from music critics and concert goers , with many complimenting the quality of Carey 's live vocals , as well as the production as a whole . 
 = = = 2005 – 07 : Resurgence with The Emancipation of Mimi = = = 
 Throughout 2004 , Carey focused on composing material for her tenth studio album , The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) . The album found Carey working predominantly with Jermaine Dupri , as well as Bryan @-@ Michael Cox , Manuel Seal , The Neptunes and Kanye West . The album debuted atop the charts in several countries , and was warmly accepted by critics . Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian defined it as " cool , focused and urban [ ... some of ] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn 't have to be paid to listen to again " , while USA Today 's Elysa Gardner wrote , " The ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying .

 By spring 2007 , Carey had begun to work on her eleventh studio album , E = MC ² , in a private villa in Anguilla .

 = = = Influences = = = 
 Carey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by Billie Holiday , Sarah Vaughan , and R & B and soul musicians such as Gladys Knight and Aretha Franklin . Her music contains strong influences of gospel music , and she credits The Clark Sisters , Shirley Caesar and Edwin Hawkins as the most influential in her early years . When Carey incorporated hip @-@ hop into her sound , speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre 's popularity , but she told Newsweek , " People just don 't understand . I grew up with this music " . She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as The Sugarhill Gang , Eric B. & Rakim , the Wu @-@ Tang Clan , The Notorious B.I.G. and Mobb Deep , with whom she collaborated on the single " The Roof ( Back in Time ) " ( 1998 ) . Carey was heavily influenced by Minnie Riperton , and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range . 
 During Carey 's career , her vocal and musical style , along with her level of success , has been compared to Whitney Houston , who she has also cited as an influence , and Celine Dion . Carey and her peers , according to Garry Mulholland , are " the princesses of wails [ ... ] virtuoso vocalists who blend chart @-@ oriented pop with mature MOR torch song " . Author and writer Lucy O 'Brien attributed the comeback of Barbra Streisand 's " old @-@ fashioned showgirl " to Carey and Dion , and described them and Houston as " groomed , airbrushed and overblown to perfection " . Carey 's musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late 1990s were , in part , initiated to distance herself from this image , and she subsequently said that most of her early work was " schmaltzy MOR " . Some have noted that unlike Houston and Dion , Carey co @-@ writes and produces her own songs . 
 = = = Musical style = = = 
 Love is the subject of the majority of Carey 's lyrics , although she has written about themes such as racism , social alienation , death , world hunger , and spirituality . She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical , but Time magazine wrote : " If only Mariah Carey 's music had the drama of her life . Her songs are often sugary and artificial — <unk> soul . But her life has passion and conflict , " applying it to the first stages of her career . He commented that as her albums progressed , so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material . Jim Faber of the New York Daily News , made similar comments , " For Carey , vocalizing is all about the performance , not the emotions that inspired it . Singing , to her , represents a physical challenge , not an emotional <unk> . " While reviewing Music Box , Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone commented that Carey sang with " sustained passion " , while Arion Berger of Entertainment Weekly wrote that during some vocal moments , Carey becomes " too overwhelmed to put her passion into words . " In 2001 , The Village Voice wrote in regards to what they considered Carey 's " centerless ballads " , writing , " Carey 's Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen @-@ pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless [ Diane ] Warren ballads [ ..... ] it 's largely because of [ Blige ] that the new R & B demands a greater range of emotional expression , smarter poetry , more from @-@ the @-@ gut testifying , and less [ sic ] unnecessary notes than the squeaky @-@ clean and just plain squeaky Mariah era . Nowadays it 's the Christina <unk> and Jessica Simpsons who awkwardly <unk> , while the women with roof @-@ raising lung power keep it in check when tune or lyric demands . " 
 Carey 's output makes use of electronic instruments such as drum machines , keyboards and synthesizers . Many of her songs contain piano @-@ driven melodies , as she was given piano lessons when she was six years old . Carey said that she cannot read sheet music and prefers to collaborate with a pianist when composing her material , but feels that it is easier to experiment with faster and less conventional melodies and chord progressions using this technique . While Carey learned to play the piano at a young age , and incorporates several ranges of production and instrumentation into her music , she has maintained that her voice has always been her most important asset : " My voice is my instrument ; it always has been . " Carey began commissioning remixes of her material early in her career and helped to spearhead the practice of recording entirely new vocals for remixes . Disc jockey David Morales has collaborated with Carey on several occasions , starting with " Dreamlover " ( 1993 ) , which popularized the tradition of remixing R & B songs into house records , and which Slant magazine named one of the greatest dance songs of all time . From " Fantasy " ( 1995 ) onward , Carey enlisted both hip @-@ hop and house producers to re @-@ structure her album compositions . Entertainment Weekly included two remixes of " Fantasy " on a list of Carey 's greatest recordings compiled in 2005 : a National Dance Music Award @-@ winning remix produced by Morales , and a Sean Combs production featuring rapper Ol ' Dirty Bastard . The latter has been credited with popularizing the R & B / hip @-@ hop collaboration trend that has continued into the 2000s , through artists such as Ashanti and Beyoncé . Combs said that Carey " knows the importance of mixes , so you feel like you 're with an artist who appreciates your work — an artist who wants to come up with something with you " . 
 = = = Voice and timbre = = = 
 Carey possesses a five @-@ octave vocal range , and has the ability to reach notes beyond the 7th octave . Referred to as the " songbird supreme " by the Guinness World Records , she was ranked first in a 2003 MTV and Blender magazine countdown of the 22 Greatest Voices in Music , as voted by fans and readers in an online poll . Carey said of the poll , " What it really means is voice of the MTV generation . Of course , it 's an enormous compliment , but I don 't feel that way about myself . " She also placed second in Cove magazine 's list of " The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists " . 
 Regarding her voice type , Carey said that she is an alto , though several critics have described her as a soprano . However , within contemporary forms of music , singers are classified by the style of music they sing . There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non @-@ classical music . Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing , but they are controversial , because the development of classical voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would amplify his or her voice with their natural resonators , without a microphone . 
 Jon Pareles of The New York Times described Carey 's lower register as a " rich , husky alto " that extends to " dog @-@ whistle high notes " . Additionally , towards the late 1990s , Carey began incorporating breathy vocals into her material . Tim <unk> from the BBC News described her vocals as " sultry close @-@ to @-@ the @-@ mic breathiness " , while USA Today 's Elysa Gardner wrote " it 's impossible to deny the impact her vocal style , a florid blend of breathy riffing and resonant belting , has had on today 's young pop and R & B stars . " 
 Sasha Frere @-@ Jones of The New Yorker adds her timbre possesses various colors , saying , " Carey 's sound changes with nearly every line , mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid , breathy coo . Her wide vocal range allows Carey to take melodies from alto bottom notes to coloratura soprano upper register . " Carey also possesses a " whisper register " . In an interview with the singer , Ron Givens of Entertainment Weekly described it this way , " first , a rippling , soulful ooh comes rolling effortlessly from her throat : alto . Then , after a quick breath , she goes for the stratosphere , with a sound that nearly changes the barometric pressure in the room . In one brief swoop , she seems to squeal and roar at the same time . " 
 Her sense of pitch is admired and Jon Pareles adds " she can linger over sensual turns , growl with playful confidence , <unk> like a scat singer ... with startlingly exact pitch . "

 Carey 's vocal style and singing ability have significantly impacted popular and contemporary music . As music critic G. Brown from The Denver Post wrote , " For better or worse , Mariah Carey 's five @-@ octave range and melismatic style have influenced a generation of pop singers . " According to Rolling Stone , " Her mastery of melisma , the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like " Vision of Love " , inspired the entire American Idol vocal school , for better or worse , and virtually every other female R & B singer since the Nineties . " Jody Rosen of Slate wrote of Carey 's influence in modern music , calling her the most influential vocal stylist of the last two decades , the person who made rococo melismatic singing . Rosen further exemplified Carey 's influence by drawing parallel with American Idol , which to her , " often played out as a clash of melisma @-@ mad Mariah wannabes . And , today , nearly 20 years after Carey 's debut , major labels continue to bet the farm on young stars such as the winner of Britain 's X Factor show , Leona Lewis , with her Generation Next gloss on Mariah 's big voice and big hair . " Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times wrote , " Depending on how you feel about public humiliation , the best / worst parts of American Idol are the audition shows , which normally break down into three distinct parts : ( 1 ) The Talented Kids . ( 2 ) The Weird Kids . ( 3 ) The Mariahs . " Daly further commented , " The Mariahs are the hardest ones to watch , mainly because most of them think they 're <unk> good . The poor , disillusioned hopefuls plant themselves in front of judges Simon Cowell , Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson – then proceed to stretch , break and mutilate every note of a song , often Mariah 's Hero , a tune that has ruined more throats than smoker 's cough . " New York Magazine 's editor Roger <unk> said that in regarding Carey as an influential artist in music , he commented that " Whitney Houston may have introduced melisma ( the vocally acrobatic style of lending a word an extra syllable or twenty ) to the charts , but it was Mariah — with her jaw @-@ dropping range — who made it into America 's default sound . " <unk> also added that " Every time you turn on American Idol , you are watching her children " . Despite her vocal prowess , Carey 's vocal technique particularly with the use of melisma and belting , has been subject to public scrutiny mainly because of young singers such as from talent shows have been overly imitating her singing technique in which critics commented " Mariah Carey is , without a doubt , the worst thing to happen to amateur singing since the karaoke machine " . As Professor Katherine L. <unk> noted in her book , The Mediation of Identity Politics in American Idol , " Carey 's influence not just stops in the emulation of melisma or her singing amongst the wannabe 's , it 's also her persona , her diva , her stardom which inspires them .... a pre @-@ fame conic look . " 
 Among the hip hop , pop , and R & B artists who have cited Carey as an influence are <unk> , Ariana Grande , Britney Spears , Beyoncé , Katy Perry , Lady Gaga , Bridgit Mendler , Christina Aguilera , Jessica Simpson , Rihanna , Grimes , Kelly Clarkson , Nelly Furtado , Bonnie McKee , Leona Lewis , Brandy Norwood , Pink , Mary J. Blige , Melanie Fiona , Missy Elliott , Sam Smith , Hikaru Utada , Regine Velasquez , Sarah Geronimo , Charice Jordin Sparks , Justin Bieber , and Jessica Sanchez . According to Stevie Wonder , " When people talk about the great influential singers , they talk about Aretha , Whitney and Mariah . That 's a testament to her talent . Her range is that amazing . " Beyoncé credits Carey 's singing and her song " Vision of Love " as influencing her to begin practicing vocal " runs " as a child , as well as helping her pursue a career as a musician . Rihanna has stated that Carey is one of her major influences and idol . Christina Aguilera said in the early stages of her career that Carey was a big influence in her singing career and one of her idols . According to Pier Dominguez , author of Christina Aguilera : A star is made , Aguilera has stated how she loved listening to Whitney Houston , but it was Carey who had the biggest influence on her vocal styling . Carey 's carefully choreographed image of a grown woman struck a chord with Aguilera . Her influence on Aguilera also grew from the fact that both are of mixed heritage . Philip <unk> , editor of The Japan Times , expressed how Carey 's vocal and melismatic style even influenced Asian singers . He wrote that Japanese singer Hikaru Utada " sang what she heard , from the diaphragm and with her own take on the kind of melisma that became de rigueur in American pop after the ascendance of Mariah Carey . " In an article titled " Out With Mariah 's <unk> , In With Kesha 's Kick " , writer David Browne of The New York Times discusses how the once ubiquitous melisma pop style suddenly lost in favor of the now ubiquitous autotune in which the former was heavily popularized by the likes of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston . Browne had commented " But beginning two decades ago , melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn 't before . Mariah Carey 's debut hit from 1990 , " Vision of Love , " followed two years later by Whitney Houston 's version of " I Will Always Love You , " set the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder , longer and <unk> than most pop fans had ever heard . " Browne further added " A subsequent generation of singers , including Ms. Aguilera , Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé , built their careers around melisma . ( Men like Brian McKnight and Tyrese also indulged in it , but women tended to dominate the form . ) " 
 Carey is also credited for introducing R & B and hip hop into mainstream pop culture , and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post @-@ 1995 songs . Sasha Frere @-@ Jones , editor of The New Yorker commented , " It became standard for R & B / hip @-@ hop stars like Missy Elliott and Beyoncé , to combine melodies with rapped verses . And young white pop stars — including Britney Spears , Jessica Simpson , Christina Aguilera , and ' N Sync — have spent much of the past ten years making pop music that is unmistakably R & B. " Moreover Jones concludes that " [ Carey 's ] idea of pairing a female songbird with the leading male MCs of hip @-@ hop changed R & B and , eventually , all of pop .

 = Yogatattva Upanishad = 
 The Yogatattva Upanishad ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् त ् <unk> उपनिषत ् , IAST : Yogatattva <unk> ) , also called as <unk> ( <unk> ् त ् <unk> ् ) , is one of the minor Upanishads of Hinduism . A Sanskrit text , it is one of eleven Yoga Upanishads attached to the Atharvaveda , and one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas . It is listed at number 41 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads . It is , as an Upanishad , a part of the corpus of Vedanta literature collection that present the philosophical concepts of Hinduism . 
 Two major versions of its manuscripts are known . One has fifteen verses but attached to Atharvaveda , while another very different and augmented manuscript exists in the Telugu language which has one hundred and forty two verses and is attached to the Krishna Yajurveda . The text is notable for describing Yoga in the Vaishnavism tradition . 
 The Yogatattva Upanishad shares ideas with the Yogasutra , Hatha Yoga , and Kundalini Yoga . It includes a discussion of four styles of yoga : Mantra , Laya , Hatha yoga and Raja . As an expounder of Vedanta philosophy , the Upanishad is devoted to the elaboration of the meaning of Atman ( Soul , Self ) through the process of yoga , starting with the syllable Om . According to Yogatattva Upanishad , " jnana ( knowledge ) without yoga cannot secure moksha ( emancipation , salvation ) , nor can yoga without knowledge secure moksha " , and that " those who seek emancipation should pursue both yoga and knowledge " . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Yoga ( from the Sanskrit root yuj ) means " to add " , " to join " , " to unite " , or " to attach " in its most common literal sense . According to Dasgupta – a scholar of Sanskrit and philosophy , the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots , yujir yoga ( to yoke ) or yuj samādhau ( to concentrate ) . 
 Yogatattva is compound word of " Yoga " and ' tattva ' , the latter meaning " Truth " , or " Reality , That @-@ ness " . Paul Deussen – a German Indologist and professor of Philosophy translates the term Yogatattva as " the essence of Yoga " . 
 The term Upanishad means it is knowledge or " hidden doctrine " text that belongs to the corpus of Vedanta literature collection presenting the philosophical concepts of Hinduism and considered the highest purpose of its scripture , the Vedas . 
 = = Chronology and anthologies = = 
 The text , states Mircea Eliade , was possibly composed in the same period as the didactic parts of the Mahabharata , the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads : <unk> ( probably composed about the same time as Maitri Upanishad ) , <unk> , <unk> , Brahmavidya , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 The Yogatattva , adds Eliade , was composed earlier than the ten or eleven later yogic Upanishads such as the Yoga @-@ <unk> , Varaha and <unk> . Alternate chronological estimates include those by Michael Whiteman – a professor of Mathematics and a writer on Yoga in Hinduism and Buddhism , ) who states it is possibly dated to about 150 CE . David White – a professor of Comparative Religion , in contrast , suggests that the text derives its " ideas and images from the heritage of classical Vedanta " , and it is likely a medieval era text composed between 11th- to 13th @-@ century CE . 
 Gavin Flood dates the Yogatattva text , along with other Yoga Upanishads , to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period . 
 In the collection of Upanishads under the title " Oupanekhat " , put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara <unk> in 1656 , consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion , the Yogatattva is listed at number 21 . Dara Shikoh 's collection was in the same order as found in Upanishad anthologies popular in north India . In the 52 Upanishads version of Colebrooke this Upanishad is listed at 23 . In the <unk> Indica edition of Narayana – an Indian scholar who lived sometime after the 14th @-@ century Vedanta scholar <unk> , the Upanishad is also listed at 23 in his list of 52 . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The Telugu version of the Yogatattva Upanishad has 142 verses , while the shortest surviving manuscript in Sanskrit is just 15 verses . Both versions open by hailing Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme Purusha or supreme spirit , the great Yogin , the Supreme Being , the great <unk> ( meditator ) , and a lamp in the path of the truth . This links the text to the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism . 
 The meaning and message in verses 3 to 15 of the Sanskrit version mirror those of the last 13 verses of the Telugu version of the text . 
 = = Contents = = 
 The Yogatattva Upanishad is among the oldest known texts on yoga that provide detailed description of Yoga techniques and its benefits . 
 For the first time , an Upanishad gives numerous and precise details concerning the extraordinary powers gained by practice and meditation . The four chief asanas ( siddha , padma , <unk> and <unk> ) are mentioned , as are the obstacles encountered by beginners – sloth , <unk> , etc . A description of pranayama follows , together with the definition of the <unk> ( unit of measurement for the phases of respiration ) , and important details of mystical physiology ( the purification of the nadis is shown by external signs : lightness of body , brilliance of complexion , increase in digestive power , etc . 
 = = = Self realization and virtues of a yoga student = = = 
 On Hindu god Brahma ’ s request Vishnu explains that all souls are caught up in the cycle of worldly pleasures and sorrow created by Maya ( changing reality ) . and Kaivalya can help overcome this cycle of birth , old age and disease . Knowledge of the shastras are futile in this regard , states Vishnu , and the description of the " indescribable state of liberation " eludes them and even the devas . 
 It is only the knowledge of ultimate reality and supreme self , the Brahman , which can lead to the path of liberation and self @-@ realization , states Yogatattva Upanishad . This realization of the supreme self is possible to the yoga student who is free from " passion , anger , fear , delusion , greed , pride , lust , birth , death , miserliness , swoon , giddiness , hunger , thirst , ambition , shame , fright , heart @-@ burning , grief and gladness " . 
 = = = Yoga and knowledge = = = 
 In the early verses of the Yogatattva Upanishad , the simultaneous importance of yoga and jnana ( knowledge ) are asserted , and declared to be mutually complimentary and necessary . 
 The text defines " knowledge " , translates Aiyar – a Sanskrit scholar , as " through which one <unk> in himself the real nature of kaivalya ( moksha ) as the supreme seat , the stainless , the <unk> , and of the nature of <unk> " ( truth @-@ consciousness @-@ bliss ) . This knowledge is of the Brahman and its non @-@ differentiated nature with that of the Atman , of Jiva and Paramatman . Yoga and knowledge ( jnana ) both go together to realise Brahman and attain salvation , according to the Upanishad . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In the Upanishad , Vishnu states to Brahma that Yoga is one , in practice of various kinds , the chief are of four types – Mantra Yoga is the practice through chants , Laya Yoga through deep concentration , Hatha Yoga through exertion , and Raja Yoga through meditation . 
 There are four states which are common to all these yogas , states the text , and these four stages of attainment are : <unk> ( beginning , the stage of practicing ethics such as non @-@ violence and proper diet , followed by asana ) , Ghata ( second integration stage to learn breath regulation and relationship between body and mind ) , <unk> ( the third intimacy stage to hold , regulate air flow , followed by meditation for relationship between mind and Atman ) , and <unk> ( fourth stage to consummate Samadhi and realize Atman ) . The emphasis and most verses in the text are dedicated to Hatha Yoga , although the text mentions Raja yoga is the culmination of Yoga . 
 The Mantra yoga is stated by the Yogatattva as a discipline of auditory recitation of mantras but stated to be an inferior form of yoga . It is the practice of mantra recitation or intonations of the sounds of alphabet , for 12 years . This gradually brings knowledge and special powers of inner attenuation , asserts the text . This mantra @-@ based method of yoga , asserts Yogatattva , is suited for those with dull wit and incapable of practicing the other three types of yoga . 
 Laya yoga is presented as the discipline of dissolution where the focus is on thinking of the " Lord without parts " all the times while going through daily life activities . The Laya Yoga , the second in the order of importance , is oriented towards assimilation by the <unk> or mind , wherein the person always thinks of formless Ishvara ( God ) . 
 The Hatha Yoga , to which Yogatattva Upanishad dedicates most of its verses , is discussed with eight interdependent practices : ten yamas ( self @-@ restraints ) , ten niyamas ( self @-@ observances ) , asana ( postures ) , pranayama ( control of breath ) , pratyahara ( conquering the senses ) , <unk> ( concentration ) , dhyana , and samadhi that is the state of meditative consciousness . 
 The text discusses meditation and thereafter through verse 128 , twenty stages of Hatha Yoga practice such as of Maha @-@ mudra , Maha @-@ Bandha , <unk> mudra , Mula Bandha , <unk> bandha , Jalandhara Bandha , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Thereafter , the Upanishad asserts Raja yoga to be the means for Yogin to detach himself from the world , translates Ayyangar – a Sanskrit scholar . The tool for meditation , states the text , is Pranava or Om mantra , which it describes in verses 134 – 140 , followed by a statement of the nature of liberation and the ultimate truth . 
 = = = = Asanas = = = = 
 The Upanishad mentions many asanas , but states four postures of the yoga for the beginner commencing on pranayama ( breathing exercises ) – <unk> , Padmasana , <unk> and <unk> . The detailed procedure and the setting for these are described in the text . 
 Sitting in Padmasana ( lotus ) posture , the text states that the pranayama or breathing must be gradual , both inhalation , holding and exhalation should be slow , steady and deep . The text introduces a series of time measures ( <unk> , musical beats ) to aid self monitoring and to measure progress , wherein the beat is created by the yoga student with fingers self circumambulating and using one 's own knee for the beat pulse . A sequential gradual inhalation over sixteen Matras ( digits ) , holding the air deep within for sixty @-@ four Matras and gradually exhaling the air over thirty @-@ two Matras is suggested as the goal of the breathing exercise . 
 The Upanishad suggests breathing exercises in a variety of ways , such as breathing with one nostril and exhaling with another , asserting that a regular practice multiple times a day cleans up the Nadis ( blood vessels ) , improves digestive powers , stamina , <unk> and causes the skin to glow . The text recommends restraining oneself from salt , mustard , acidic foods , spicy astringent pungent foods . The text also states that the yoga student should avoid fasting , early morning baths , sexual intercourse , and sitting near fire . Milk and ghee ( clarified butter ) , cooked wheat , green gram and rice are foods the text approves of , in verses 46 – 49 . The Upanishad also recommends massage , particularly areas of body that tremor or profusely perspire during the practice of yoga . 
 The next stage of Yoga practice , states the text , is termed Ghata ( Sanskrit : <unk> ) with the goal of bringing union of Prana ( breath ) , Apana ( hydration and aeration of body ) , Manas ( mind ) and Buddhi ( intellect ) , as well as between <unk> ( life soul force ) and Paramatman ( supreme soul ) . This practice is a step , asserts the text , for Pratyahara ( withdrawal from distraction by sensory organs ) and Dharana ( concentration ) . The aim of Dharana , states Yogatattva , is to conceive everyone and everything one perceives with any of his senses as same as his own self and soul ( Atman ) . In verses 72 to 81 , the text describes a range of mystical powers that develop within those who have mastered Ghata stage of yoga . The Upanishad adds that " perfection requires practice , the yogin must never revel in what he achieves , never be vain , never be distracted by trying to comply with demonstration requests , remain oblivious to others , yet be always intent on achieving the goals he sets for himself " . 
 = = = = Kundalini = = = = 
 The Upanishad , in verse 82 and onwards , elaborates on the third stage of Yogic practice , calling it the <unk> ( Sanskrit : <unk> , intimacy ) state . It is the stage where the yogin awakens the Kundalini , asserts the text . Kundalini , states James <unk> – a professor of Religion and Asian Studies , refers to " the latent spiritual power that exists in every person " . The premise mentioned in Yogatattva , is also a fundamental concept in Tantra , and symbolizes an aspect of Shakti that is typically dormant in every person , and its awakening is a goal in Tantra . In Yogatattva text , this stage is described as where the Yogin 's Chitta ( mind ) awakens and enters the Sushumna and the chakras . 
 The five elements of <unk> , Apas , Agni , Vayu and Akash are called as the " five Brahmans " corresponding to five gods within ( Brahma , Vishnu , Rudra , Ishvara and Sada @-@ Shiva ) , and reaching them is described by the text as a process of meditation . The meditation on each , asserts Yogatattva , is assisted by colors , geometry and mantras : <unk> with yellow @-@ gold , quadrilateral and <unk> , <unk> with white , crescent and <unk> , agni with red , triangle and <unk> , <unk> with black , <unk> ( hexagram ) and <unk> , <unk> with smoke , circle and <unk> . 
 The Upanishad dedicates verses 112 through 128 on a variety of Hatha yoga asanas . The procedure and benefits of yoga practices of <unk> ( standing on the head for 24 minutes ) , <unk> and <unk> are explained briefly by the text . With these practices the Yogin attains the Raja Yoga state , realizes the facts of the life cycle of mother @-@ son @-@ wife relationship . 
 = = = = Om meditation = = = = 
 The Upanishad expounds the principles behind Om mantra as part of the yogic practice asserting that " A " , " U " and " M " are three letters that mirror the " three Vedas , three <unk> ( morning , noon and evening ) , three <unk> ( sounds ) , three <unk> and three Guṇas " . Metaphorically this practice is compared to realizing the hidden smell of a flower , reaching the ghee ( clarified butter ) in milk , reaching the oil innate in sesame seeds , effort to extract gold from its ore , and finding the Atman in one 's heart . The letter " A " represents the flowering of lotus , " U " represents the blooming of the flower , " M " reaches its nada ( tattva or truth inside , sound ) , and " <unk> " ( half @-@ metre ) indicates the Turiya , or bliss of silence . 
 The Upanishad states that following the yogic practices prescribed , once the yogin has mastered the functioning of nine orifices of the body and awakened the Sushumna inwards , he awakens his Kundalini , he becomes self @-@ aware , knows the Truth and gains the conviction of his Atman .

 Yogatattva Upanishad is one of the most important text on Yoga . 
 It is the Yogatattva that appears to be most minutely acquainted with yogic practices : it mentions the eight angas and distinguishes the four kinds of yoga : Mantra yoga , Laya yoga , Hatha yoga and Raja yoga . 
 The text , states Whiteman , discusses a variety of Yoga systems , including the Hatha yoga , " a system of practices developed intensively ' , with the basic objective of " health and cleanliness of the physical body and perfection of voluntary control over all its functions . " A notable feature of this Upanishad is definition of four types of yoga and a comparison . 
 The Yogatattva Upanishad and the Brahma Upanishad are also known as one of the early sources of tantric ideas related to chakras , which were adopted in Tibetan Buddhism . However , states Yael <unk> , there are minor differences between the location of inner fires as described in the texts of Tibetan Buddhism and in Yogatattva text of Hinduism .

 " What Was Missing " is the tenth episode of the third season of the American animated television series Adventure Time . The episode was written and storyboarded by Adam Muto and Rebecca Sugar , from a story by Mark Banker , Kent Osborne , Patrick McHale , and series creator Pendleton Ward .

In this episode , Finn , Jake , Princess Bubblegum , and Marceline form a band in order to defeat the Door Lord and recover what the creature had stolen from them . 
 Sugar noted that while the episode may appear to be about friendship , it is really about the power of telling the truth , as exemplified by the episode 's songs . Episode composer Tim Kiefer played all of the conventional instruments himself , and used unique instruments , like a Game Boy , to make some of the loops heard in the episode . The episode was watched by 2 @.@ 185 million people and caused a major controversy due to the suggestion of an intimate ( and possibly romantic ) history between Marceline and Bubblegum , a fact that also garnered praise for the episode from several LGBTQ @-@ oriented review sites .

 " What Was Missing " was written and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto from a story developed by Mark Banker , Patrick McHale , Osborne , and series creator Pendleton Ward . The entry was directed by Larry Leichliter . " What Was Missing " was Sugar and Muto 's second episode dealing with Marceline , and because of this , Sugar later noted on her Tumblr that both " wanted to get it right " . Sugar later explained that , " It might seem like this episode is about friendship , but I wanted it to be about honesty ! Marceline almost gets the door open because she drops her guard and tells the truth for a second while she sings this song . " She later likened the theme of the episode to a quote by Bob Fosse — “ The time to sing is when your emotional level is too high to just speak anymore " — noting that she " really wanted to try for that feeling . " The original title for the episode was " Door Jam " , but this was later changed because , according to Muto , the show tries to avoid pun @-@ based titles . 
 All of the songs featured in the episode were initially composed by Sugar , who released her demo version of " I 'm Just Your Problem " on her official Tumblr page . Her father , Rob , later released the demos for both " I 'm Just Your Problem " and " My Best Friends in the World " on YouTube . " I 'm Just Your Problem " was actually the last song written for the episode ; Sugar was down to the last minute , and as such , she argued that her emotionally exhausted state informed her songwriting . The song was inspired by an incident that Sugar had experienced with a former roommate . Although the two often fought , Sugar desperately wanted them to be friends despite not particularly liking her . Sugar transferred this situation onto Marceline , writing the song so that Marceline — while having issues with Princess Bubblegum — wanted to become her friend . " My Best Friends in the World " was written by Sugar as a celebration of the friendship she shared with her coworkers , especially her storyboarding partner , Muto . Ward later admitted on the commentary track for " What Was Missing " that , while he was editing the animatic for the episode , he started to cry because the songs featured in the episode were so full of emotion . Adventure Time composer , Tim Kiefer , played the instruments featured in the episode himself . To complement the tones of the bass and viola , he created percussion sounds with Game Boy loops , and then used an <unk> for " Princess Bubblegum 's melodies " to make " pretty , melodic swoops to accompany BMO 's rigid , robotic patterns , loops , and structures .

The A.V. Club named the episode one of the ten additional installments of the series that illustrates that " emotional complexity " lies " beneath Adventure Time 's weirdness " . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 " What Was Missing " became controversial because of an allegedly implied past relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum . The controversy largely began after an accompanying " Mathematical " recap — a behind the scenes video series produced by Frederator Studios that implied that there were lesbian relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans . This incident was addressed by Fred Seibert , the show 's executive producer , who said that " in trying to get the show ’ s audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far . " Soon after , the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube , although " What Was Missing " still airs during reruns . Seibert 's decision to remove the video also proved controversial ; Bitch magazine later wrote an article about how the episode " handled female desire — female queer desire at that — in a subtle but complex way " , but that the removal of the recap and the studio 's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children 's television . Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view , saying that , because there were " so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet " , he did not " really want to comment on it [ because ] it was a big hullaballoo . " 
 In August 2014 , Marceline 's voice actress Olivia Olson told a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes & Noble book signing from The Adventure Time Encyclopedia , that , according to Ward , Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past , but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal , the show has not been able to officially make clear the relationship in the series itself . August 8 , the day the panel footage was uploaded to YouTube , Olson Tweeted she liked to make things up at panels and told her followers they all take her stories too seriously .

 Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) accidentally burns his foot while grilling bacon on his George Foreman Grill , which he keeps next to his bed . After he makes a distress call to the office , Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) comes to " rescue " him , but crashes his car into a pole and suffers a concussion .

 Michael becomes upset with the staff 's lack of compassion towards his " disability " , and brings in Billy Merchant ( Marcus A.

Billy soon leaves after Michael makes several offensive remarks , but not before pointing out to Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) that Dwight has suffered a concussion . 
 Jim and Michael take Dwight to the hospital where Michael insists that his burned foot is a more serious injury than Dwight 's blunt force trauma . Before they go , Pam bids " goodbye " to the concussed Dwight , aware that she will probably never see the good @-@ natured version of Dwight Schrute ever again .

" The Injury " was written by Mindy Kaling , who also acts for the show as customer service representative Kelly Kapoor . After the character development that had occurred in the previous episode , " Booze Cruise " , Greg Daniels decided to create a more inane episode that involved " Michael 's grilled foot . " Writer and actor B. J. Novak said the idea for " Injury " started out as an idea in the writing room that just " spun out of control " . The original plan was for Michael to have fallen asleep in the sun , while having sunblock all over him , except for his foot . According to BJ Novak , the episode was originally going to be called " My Grilled Foot " , but writer Mindy Kaling thought it was " too weird for people to tune in and watch that " . Novak has described " The Injury " as one of his favorite episodes , and said of it , " I don 't think any other TV show would have made an episode from that starting point , and yet it was one of the funniest and most relatable episodes as it went on that we 've ever had .

 = Call of Cthulhu : Dark Corners of the Earth = 
 Call of Cthulhu : Dark Corners of the Earth is a survival horror video game developed by Headfirst Productions and published by Bethesda Softworks with 2K Games and Ubisoft for the PC and Xbox systems . The game was published first for the Xbox in 2005 and the PC version followed in 2006 . Call of Cthulhu : Dark Corners of the Earth combines an action @-@ adventure game with a relatively realistic first @-@ person shooter and elements of a stealth game . 
 The game is based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft , author of " The Call of Cthulhu " and progenitor of the Cthulhu Mythos . It is a reimagining of Lovecraft 's 1936 novella The Shadow over Innsmouth . Set mostly in the year 1922 , the story follows Jack Walters , a mentally unstable private detective hired to investigate in Innsmouth , a strange and mysterious town that has cut itself from the rest of the United States . 
 In development since 1999 , the project was repeatedly delayed , going through several revisions and having some of its most ambitious and immersive features abandoned and the initially planned PlayStation 2 version cancelled . Although well received by most critics and regarded by some as one of the best horror video games of all time , Dark Corners of the Earth was a commercial failure . At least two additional Cthulhu Mythos games were planned by Headfirst Productions , including a direct sequel titled Call of Cthulhu : Destiny 's End , but both were never completed due to Headfirst 's bankruptcy . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Initial gameplay of Call of Cthulhu : Dark Corners of the Earth comprises unarmed escape and evasion together with investigative exploration , although first @-@ person shooter ( FPS ) style combat is introduced later on . As with most survival horror video games , ammunition is limited and must be conserved carefully for situations when it will really be indispensable , occasionally requiring the player to avoid combat even when armed . The game as a whole is heavily scripted and very linear , with only one path through the chapters from start to finish , in contrast with some earlier survival horror games such as the original Alone in the Dark ( which itself was inspired by the Mythos ) . 
 The game features no heads @-@ up display . Instead , condition of the player character is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing , which become more pronounced when wounded , and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength . Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally : for example , a broken leg causes the character to limp while making appropriate noises , while a broken arm makes aiming more difficult . The health system was designed as a more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds , including poisoning and bleeding , require different remedies , such as a splint for a broken leg . The inventory screen shows the character 's injuries ( displayed on his character model ) and all carried items . 
 The player 's character gradually loses sanity when he looks directly at upsetting aspects of the game world . The character 's mental degradation can lead him to hearing hallucinations and visions , which manifest as graphical anomalies and sound distortion , and changes in control sensitivity . If the character becomes too unsettled , results may include his permanent insanity or suicide , and a game over . The sanity can be restored through finding areas of sanctuary or defeating enemies . The areas marked with the Elder Signs serve as sanctuaries against the enemies and as save points . To enhance its replayability value , the game features a system whereby players can gain Mythos Points , supposed to reflect a level of gained knowledge . Such points can be used to unlock in @-@ game bonuses , such as additional information and items . 
 Most of the ranged weapons are based on real firearms with the exception of a Yithian directed @-@ energy weapon introduced at the end of the game . The player character can also perform a melee attack with a crowbar or with a gun if all ammunition for it has been used up . The game features a realistic combat system : due to lack of HUD , the player has to count shots manually to know when the gun goes empty . There is also no artificial on @-@ screen targeting reticle ; instead , the player must aim through the iron sights on the weapons themselves , but sustained aiming tires the character and drops accuracy . The shooting system is unique in that fired rounds go exactly where the gun 's barrel is pointing . For example , if the player character readies a reloaded weapon and the player pulls the trigger before the character animation has finished , the round will be discharged in the direction the gun was pointing when the shot was fired .

 Following the introduction sequence set in Arkham Asylum psychiatric hospital , the game begins on September 6 , 1915 , as police detective Jack Walters ( voiced by Milton Lawrence ) is summoned to the siege of a decrepit manor house in Boston . The manor is inhabited by a bizarre cult called the Fellowship of the <unk> , led by one Victor Holt who has asked specifically for Walters to come and talk to him . Taking cover from an ensuing firefight , Walters finds himself separated from the police and trapped inside the mansion , with no option but to investigate . When the rest of the police finally break in , they find the cultists dead by mass suicide and Walters apparently insane . He is committed to Arkham sanatorium , where he stays for six years . 
 Walters is released and becomes a private investigator . On February 6 , 1922 , he takes up a missing person case at Innsmouth , a xenophobic coastal town , and the site of the recent disappearance of Brian Burnham , a clerk that had been sent there to establish a local store for the First National Grocery chain . Arriving in the isolated town , which appears to be depopulated and in a state of collapse , Jack unsuccessfully asks around for Brian . He stays the night at a hotel , where he barely escapes an assassination attempt and then flees from a chase by an armed mob . From that point forward , Jack is forced to sneak through the alleys , buildings and sewers of Innsmouth , avoiding murderous patrols of the town 's corrupt police and the cultists looking for him . He acquires weapons to defend himself and meets undercover agent Lucas Mackey , who tells him that the town is under federal investigation . Jack eventually finds Burnham and his girlfriend Ruth , but their car crashes when they escape from Innsmouth , killing Brian and injuring Jack ( it is left unknown whether Ruth was killed or not ) . Jack recovers from the incident and , following a brutal interrogation , he is taken in by the FBI squad led by J. Edgar Hoover . On February 8 , Jack helps Hoover and the FBI raid the Marsh Gold Refinery , where he is attacked by an ancient creature known as a <unk> and uncovers a Cthulhu shrine before the building is demolished . 
 After the refinery raid , the U.S. military begins a combined land @-@ and @-@ sea assault on Innsmouth on February 9 . The only part of the town that proves resistant to the attack is the headquarters of the Esoteric Order of Dagon , a cult devoted to two undersea demigods and Cthulhu that holds the whole town under its grip . The building proves <unk> for the Coast Guard and the Marines , but Jack finds a way in through an old smuggling entrance that is guarded by a star @-@ spawn of Cthulhu . Inside , Jack frees Agent Mackey , who has been kidnapped for a ritual sacrifice , and brings down the magical shield protecting the building . After discovering a secret chamber , he falls through the floor of a tunnel which leads into the sea . Jack is rescued by the USS Urania , a Coast Guard vessel which is part of a group heading to Devil 's Reef on February 10 , following up on a lead provided by the FBI . On the way there , wizards on the reef summon powerful tidal waves to destroy the flotilla but Jack kills them . The humanoid fish @-@ men known as Deep Ones launch a massed attack on the Urania and eventually the Father Dagon emerges too . Jack manages to defeat the gigantic demigod , but Urania sinks . Jack survives and finds himself on Devil 's Reef , where he discovers old smuggling tunnels beneath the seabed , leading him to the underwater city of Y 'ha @-@ <unk> . The city is found to be located below Devil 's Reef and is the home of the Deep Ones and members of the Order . U.S. Navy submarines attempt to torpedo Y 'ha @-@ <unk> , but are stopped by a magical barrier protecting the city . The Temple of Dagon is the source of the barrier , but the entrance is sealed off to prevent any interference . Jack finds another way in through ancient tunnels feared by the Deep Ones at the bottom of the city 's foundations . Apparently , this passage , which leads to the temple , is an ancient prison for flying polyps , the enemy of the Great Race of <unk> . Jack manages to defeat them with the help of a Yithian energy weapon . Jack then enters the Temple of Dagon and kills Mother Hydra , whose song is generating the barrier , by deafening some of the Deep Ones to her song , allowing him to take control of them . With the barrier down , the submarines attack the city , while Jack escapes through a portal leading back to the Order 's headquarters and collapses in front of Hoover and Mackey . 
 In the end , it is revealed that a Yithian swapped minds with Jack Walters ' father during the moment of Jack 's conception . In flesh , Jack Walters is human , but he inherited Yithian psychic powers , which was the reason for the cultists ' interest in him , and explains why he has visions of coming danger and of the Yithian library @-@ city of <unk> , as well as his ability to control Deep Ones in the Temple of Dagon . Returning to the introductory scene , confined in Arkham Asylum once more , Jack hangs himself on February 16 , 1922 , unable to handle the reality of himself and what he has witnessed . The game is supposed to be " based on the writings in Jack 's journal , which were discovered in 1924 . "

 The game was in development by Headfirst Productions for at least six years , and the development can be traced back to August 1999 and a discussion on the Usenet group <unk> in which the Mythos fans contributed ideas for the game to Headfirst 's Andrew Brazier . This and other feedback was later used to create the game , which Brazier termed " <unk> - a First Person Horror Adventure Shooter " . The game 's protagonist Jack Walters has been repeatedly redesigned before his final look was created by Tim Appleton . Headfirst initially used the game engine NDL <unk> for rendering graphics combined with the Havok physics engine but later developed its own engine . 
 The first screenshots were shown in December 1999 , and the game , originally planned for the PC and PlayStation 2 , was scheduled for release in the third quarter of 2001 . In 2000 , Headfirst secured rights from Chaosium , publisher of Call of Cthulhu role @-@ playing game . Before E3 2001 the game was stated to be " 70 percent complete " , but was then repeatedly delayed . In late 2002 , the game 's original publisher <unk> Interactive was taken over by JoWood , which had no interest in the title . The developers then signed a deal with Bethesda to release the game for the PC and Xbox , and the development of the PlayStation 2 version was aborted . 
 Headfirst Productions originally intended for a much larger , nonlinear RPG @-@ type storyline to be fitted within the game , including more characters and locations , as well as a cooperative gameplay system for up to four players . The latter would have enabled the players to pick one of four characters and either carry out their own investigation independently or team up with the others ( in case of single @-@ player gameplay , the other three investigators would be under AI control ) . A multiplayer version of the game would have allowed for online deathmatch battles in specifically designed levels . Several other ambitious features , such as a deeper sanity system and a high degree of environment interactivity , were also scrapped due to budget and time constraints and problems with the level design . The game was always supposed to use first @-@ person view , but the screenshots from 2001 showed some third @-@ person view and stealth gameplay elements . Much of a promised " wide array of weapons " at the player 's disposal was conceived but ultimately removed from the game , including a wooden club , a Mauser <unk> pistol , and a pump @-@ action shotgun . Various weapon models and concept arts from the game were released by a former Headfirst artist Niel Venter via DeviantArt . 
 Although the game 's story diverges in several places and features a completely different protagonist , several levels mirror passages from Lovecraft 's novella The Shadow over Innsmouth . It also contains elements of the Call of Cthulhu role @-@ playing game 's campaign Escape from Innsmouth , such as the Marsh Refinery raid . A major sub @-@ plot of the game is inspired by Lovecraft 's novella The Shadow Out of Time .

 Call of Cthulhu : Dark Corners of the Earth was released on October 24 , 2005 for the Xbox , and on March 27 , 2006 for the PC . The game contains a number of software bugs , which have never been officially patched ; these bugs are generally intermittent , and restoring from an earlier saved game can be enough to get past them . There is also an unofficial patch available that fixes some glitches and lowers the game 's overall difficulty level . The Xbox version is officially compatible with the Xbox 360 in certain regions .

 Call of Cthulhu : Dark Corners of the Earth received generally favorable reviews , but was also often criticized for being buggy and inaccessible for many players because of its high difficulty . GameSpy ranked it as the tenth best game of E3 2004 while GameSpot nominated it for their " Most Surprisingly Good Game of 2005 " award , with a comment that " after a development cycle that was nearing infinity , it 's hard to imagine a world where this H.P. Lovecraft @-@ based horror game turned out all right . Luckily for us , we don 't have to imagine it . " According to IGN , the game " succeeds brilliantly in some areas , " making " great use of the source material " and forcing players " to accept some realistic responsibility for their character " due to the sanity system and HUD @-@ less display , but can make the players " cringe at the difficult nature of the game . " Greg Kasavin of GameSpot opined " a thick , unsettling atmosphere fills this ambitious first @-@ person action @-@ adventure , which makes up for some frustrating moments and dated graphics with plenty of chills , variety , and originality . " Cheat Code Central 's Cole Smith called it " one of the greatest book to game translations ever " and a game " that is full of twists , turns and incredibly wonderful scary surprises . It 's got a great atmosphere which is sustained by dark and grainy graphics , chilling sound effects and an incredibly improbable storyline that is treated properly as to suspend reality from creeping in and ruining your experience . " GameSpy 's Allen Rausch wrote " this disturbing slice of Lovecraft 's America is well worth the time to visit , " as " despite the occasional missteps , Call of Cthulhu : Dark Corners of the Earth is a more than fitting tribute to its literary inspiration . " Similarly , Kyle Williams of Gaming Target called it " a labor of love " that " defies convention in favor of creating a videogame experience that is a worthy heir to the Lovecraft name . " Team Xbox 's Matthew Fisher wrote that , despite some of the game 's various shortcomings regarding the graphics and some of the detective aspects , " this is an immersive experience that is a new and unique title for the Xbox , which is more than a welcome change . Was it worth the wait ? Absolutely . " Despite the mostly positive reviews , the game was a commercial failure . 
 The game was also acclaimed in several retrospective articles by various publications . A.V. Club 's Drew Toal called it " a weird and difficult game , in the best sense , " while Davide Tomei from Adventure Classic Gaming described it as " a very unique game [ that ] brilliantly mixes in elements of action , adventure , and puzzle solving to offer up an exceptional survival horror experience . " Marshall Lemon from The Escapist acclaimed it as an example of a horror game that features firearms @-@ based combat while still being scary and opined " the end result plays like something Lovecraft would have created if he wrote games instead of books and lived beyond the 1930s . " The game 's townsfolk of Innsmouth placed ninth on GamesRadar 's 2008 list of the gaming 's " scariest villains ever " and 1UP.com featured it on their 2009 list of top five game worlds " where insanity is the entire point " . In 2011 , The Daily Telegraph listed it among the scariest games " you 've never played " as second only to Amnesia : The Dark Descent , adding that this " flawed classic " was " too buggy , too tough , and criminally ignored upon release . " <unk> 's Kyle Lawrence recommended it as an " action game within a very well written Lovecraftian tale that uses the mythos to its fullest . Anyone who has an interest in Lovecraft should brave the horrendous difficulty and glitches of the game . " PC Gamer UK put it at 87th place on their 2011 list of best PC games of all time for its frantic hotel escape sequence and " other great , scary set @-@ pieces , " calling it , " behind the bugs and clunkiness , a genuine and admirable attempt . " That same year , GamePro ranked it as the 11th best horror game of all time .

 More Call of Cthulhu franchise games were announced by Headfirst Productions . Due to the very long development cycle of Dark Corners of the Earth , the other titles were being developed alongside it . 
 Call of Cthulhu : Destiny 's End was a third @-@ person perspective survival horror title for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox , which was originally announced in November 2002 as a PlayStation 2 @-@ exclusive Call of Cthulhu : Tainted Legacy for a planned release in the fourth quarter of 2004 . It was to be a direct sequel to Dark Corners of the Earth , set in the ruins of Innsmouth and in locations along the coast of New England in modern times , nearly 80 years after the events of the original game . It was to feature a cooperative multiplayer mode for two players , each controlling one of the two characters : the gun @-@ wielding Jacob and the magic @-@ using Emily ( in its early version , Tainted Legacy , they were Joshua and Jack Walters ' granddaughter Madeline ) . Its gameplay was publicly presented during the E3 2005 . 
 Call of Cthulhu : Beyond the Mountains of Madness too was announced in November 2002 and has been scheduled for the Xbox and PC release in the fourth quarter of 2004 . It would be a sequel to Lovecraft 's novella At the Mountains of Madness , inspired by the Call of Cthulhu RPG campaign of the same title .

 Both games were cancelled when the company failed to find a new publisher for them in 2006 , resulting in the bankruptcy and liquidation of Headfirst . UGO.com 's Marissa Meli included Destiny 's End on her 2011 list of 25 cancelled video games that " could have been some of the greatest games of all time " and Bloody Disgusting 's Adam Dodd put both follow @-@ up titles on their 2013 list of six cancelled horror video games " that could 've been amazing " .

 NY 275 begins at the intersection of Wellsville and Main streets in the village of Bolivar .

The route initially passes by commercial buildings in the village 's business district ; however , they quickly give way to more residential areas after just two blocks . As the highway heads away from the village center , the homes become scattered ahead of intersections with the eastern terminus of County Route 5A ( CR 5A , named Salt Rising Road ) and the south end of CR 40 ( Deans Flat Road ) . The rural trend soon reverses as NY 275 enters the adjacent village of Richburg . Here , NY 275 is also known as Main Street as it serves Richburg 's business district and the surrounding residential neighborhoods .

 NY 275 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the portion of its modern alignment between the village of Bolivar and the hamlet of Friendship . At the time , NY 275 's northern terminus was at its intersection with West Main Street ( now CR 20 ) in Friendship , then part of NY 63 and later NY 408 . In the early 1970s , the portion of the Southern Tier Expressway near Friendship was completed and opened to traffic . However , NY 275 continued to end at NY 408 in Friendship until the mid @-@ 1970s when NY 408 was truncated to Nunda . As a result , NY 275 was extended a short distance northward to meet the Southern Tier Expressway at exit 29 .

He then moved alone to Turin but after some time he wanted to return to his home ; when Pellissier was 14 he returned definitively to Torino . He made his senior debut and played one match in Serie B during the 1996 – 97 season against Salernitana . In 1998 , Pellissier was on the team that won the under @-@ 21 tournament Torneo di Viareggio , and also appeared in a Coppa Italia match .

 Pellissier returned to Chievo for the 2002 – 03 season , making his Serie A debut on 22 September 2002 , when he played for 46 minutes in a 2 – 1 loss against Brescia Calcio . On 3 November , Pellissier played as a 63rd @-@ minute substitute for Luigi <unk> and scored his first goal — the only in that match — against Parma F.C. During that season , he played 25 matches in the league and scored five goals — two of which were scored in consecutive matches against Piacenza Calcio and Como Calcio . Outside the Italian League , Pellissier appeared four times in the Coppa Italia , and once in the 2002 – 03 UEFA Cup as a 79th minute for Massimo <unk> in the second match against Red Star Belgrade .

During the 2004 – 05 season , he scored seven times in 34 appearances . He scored twice in a 3 @-@ 1 victory against Brescia . 2005 – 06 was Pellissier 's breakout season ; he made a significant contribution to Chievo 's campaign , scoring 13 league goals of Chievo 's 54 . Among them , Pellissier scored in four consecutive matches and twice in the matches against U.S. Lecce and Reggina Calcio . The season was an important one ; the 2006 Italian football scandal ensured that Chievo finished in fourth place because of various points deductions to other sides , qualifying Chievo for the 2006 – 07 UEFA Champions League . 
 In the Champions League , Chievo were eliminated by Levski Sofia after losing two matches 2 – 0 and 2 – 2 ; Pellissier played these matches and did not score in either . Chievo were also knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Sporting Braga in two matches , in which Pellissier was not on the team 's lineup . For Pellissier it was a good season ; he was voted Chievo 's best player by its supporters , winning the " Cangrande del <unk> " . He scored 9 league goals in 36 appearances , but on the final day , Chievo were relegated to Serie B for the first time . Pellissier chose to stay with Chievo despite their relegation and was made captain in the 2007 – 08 season . He was a key player of their return to Serie A , scoring a career best 22 goals for the year and winning the Cangrande award again . His total of 22 surpassed Raffaele Cerbone 's record of 20 goals in a single season for Chievo .

He scored two braces in the season — the first in a 3 – 1 win against Napoli and the other in a 3 – 0 win against Brescia . He made his 100th appearance for Chievo on 6 February 2011 in a 2 – 1 loss against Lazio . 
 In a 2 – 1 victory against Novara Calcio on 2 February 2012 , Pellissier scored his 100th goal for Chievo . On 18 February , he was accused of being involved on the 2011 – 12 Italian football scandal , which affected his performance . Nevertheless , he also scored in consecutive matches against Fiorentina and Catania Calcio , and a brace in a 4 – 4 draw against Palermo . He scored a 8 league goals in 35 appearances in the 2011 – 12 season , when he won his fourth Cangrande award . On 26 August 2012 , in his 300th Serie A match for the <unk> , he scored his first goal of five in his 24 appearances of the 2012 – 13 season .

 Graduation is the third studio album by American hip hop recording artist and record producer Kanye West . It was released on September 11 , 2007 , by Roc @-@ A @-@ Fella Records . Recording sessions for the album took place during 2005 to 2007 at Chung King Studios and Sony Music Studios in New York City and at Chalice Studios and The Record Plant in Los Angeles . It was primarily produced by West himself , with significant contributions from DJ Toomp , as well as Mike Dean , Nottz , Brian " All Day " Miller , Eric Hudson , Warryn Campbell , Gee Roberson , Plain Pat and Jon Brion . It features guest contributions from artists , including Mos Def , Dwele , T @-@ Pain , Lil Wayne , DJ Premier and Chris Martin of Coldplay . The album 's cover artwork was designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami . 
 Inspired by indie rock and Chicago house , Graduation marked a movement away from the ornate , soul @-@ based sound of West 's previous releases toward a more anthemic style that would function well while he was performing in large arenas . Toward this end , West incorporated synthesizer sounds into his production and dabbled with electronic music , while sampling from a wider spectrum of sources . Lyrically , the album is more introspective in comparison to its predecessors , as West dedicated much of the album towards analyzing himself and exploring his ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame . It continues the education theme of West 's previous two studio albums , The College Dropout ( 2004 ) and Late Registration ( 2005 ) . 
 The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 , selling 957 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . It produced five singles , including the international hits " Can 't Tell Me Nothing " , " Stronger " , and " Good Life " . The coinciding release dates between Graduation and a fellow rapper 50 Cent 's Curtis generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition , resulting in record @-@ breaking sales performances by both albums . The outcome of the competition marks a turning point in hip @-@ hop culture , when the dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip @-@ hop was brought to an end . Graduation received positive reviews from most critics and earned West several accolades , including his third Grammy Award for Best Rap Album . The album has sold 2 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 copies in the US and has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . 
 = = Background = = 
 Graduation is the third installment of Kanye West 's planned tetralogy of education @-@ themed studio albums , which West subsequently later deviated from due to the events surrounding the conception of his fourth studio album , 808s & Heartbreak . The album demonstrates yet another distinctive progression in West 's musical style and approach to production . After spending the previous year touring the world with Irish rock band U2 on their Vertigo Tour , West became inspired by watching Bono open the stadium tours every night to incredible ovations and sought out to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large stadiums and arenas . In West 's attempt to accomplish this " stadium @-@ status " endeavor , West incorporated layered electronic synthesizers into his hip @-@ hop production , which also finds him utilizing slower tempos , being influenced by the music of the 1980s , and experimenting with electronic music . Kanye West was particularly influenced by house music , a subgenre of electronic dance music that first originated in his hometown of Chicago , Illinois in the early 1980s . West has stated that growing up , he would listen to hip @-@ hop music at home or in his car , but when he felt like dancing , he would attend a house club . While he rarely listened to house at home , he still felt it was an important part of his culture and background . 
 West further broadened his musical palette on Graduation by not limiting himself to his customary use of samples and interpolation from classic soul records and instead drew influences from a far more eclectic range of music genres . Along with house music , Graduation contains samples and music elements of euro @-@ disco , hard rock , electronica , lounge , progressive rock , synth @-@ pop , electro , krautrock , dub , reggae , and dancehall . Also , for much of the third studio album , Kanye West modified his style of rapping and adopted a dilatory , exuberant flow in emulation of Bono 's operatic vocal stylings . West altered his vocabulary , he utilized less of the percussive , rhythmic consonants in favor of the more smoother , melodic vowel sounds . In addition to U2 , West drew inspiration from other arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin for the melodies and chord progressions of his songs . In terms of lyricism , he simplifies some of his rhymes after touring with The Rolling Stones on their A Bigger Bang concert tour and discovering he could not captivate the audiences as well with his most complex lyrical themes . 
 West made a conscious decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks . He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances , limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album . The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner , more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie @-@ rock that West had been listening to around the time of the recording of his third studio album . West cites the rock bands The Killers , Keane , Modest Mouse , and indie @-@ pop singer @-@ songwriter Feist , whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration , for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation . Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers , West believed that his record took hip @-@ hop in a different direction . But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album . However , he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Kanye West began working on Graduation immediately after releasing his second studio album Late Registration . By late September 2005 , West had already completed three songs for the album , which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks . Around the time of the recording of the third studio album , West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer @-@ songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities . The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends , including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson , all of whom claimed his music and the way he dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan . Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands , including The Killers , Radiohead , Modest Mouse , and Keane , in order to gain new ideas on how to make his hip @-@ hop production style more stadium @-@ friendly . Additionally , West would often test his new songs on his iPod , in his office , in dance clubs and just about anywhere people might listen to his music . He would then make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received , repeating the process as many times as necessary . 
 In comparison to previous albums , Graduation features fewer guest appearances from other recording artists . West elaborated that it was a fully conscious decision to keep his guest vocalists at a minimum , saying that , " When I hear the records of my favorite bands – The Killers or Coldplay – you only hear one voice from start to finish . " R & B singers T @-@ Pain and Dwele , New York rappers Mos Def and <unk> . Back , and famed hip @-@ hop record producer DJ Premier are featured in individual tracks primarily to deliver hooks and refrains . However , though he originally intended for Graduation to be completely devoid of guest rap verses , West decided to invite New Orleans rapper Lil Wayne on the track " Barry Bonds " . At the time , the two MCs had been working together , with West contributing to the production of Lil Wayne 's sixth studio album Tha Carter III . As for the absence of skits , West explained , " There 's just serious songs , hooks , chords , and ideas . No special effects or antics ... and no fake Bernie Mac ! " West instead decided to record two earthy musical interludes in place of the hip @-@ hop skits . He incorporated African sounds and polyrhythmic percussion into both . However , for unknown reasons , the two musical interludes were omitted from the studio album . 
 Many songs on Graduation contain background vocals provided by Connie Mitchell of the Australian dance music group Sneaky Sound System . The collaboration came about when West met her bandmates Angus McDonald and Daimon Downey at a diner in Sydney while touring the country with U2 around November 2006 . Seeking musical inspiration , West asked McDonald for ideas , who in turn suggested that he be introduced to Mitchell . Upon meeting Mitchell after she arrived at Studios 301 where he was recording music during the tour , West had her sing over a vocal track and quickly took a liking to her voice . U2 singer Bono and guitarist The Edge also complimented Mitchell 's singing while visiting the studio . Some time later , Mitchell received a call from West who asked if she could travel to The Record Plant in Los Angeles to begin recording tracks for his third studio album . Mitchell later admitted that while she previously didn 't know who Kanye West was and never really cared for hip @-@ hop music , the collaboration has changed her views . 
 During an interview with Billboard , West revealed that he had worked with Chris Martin , the lead singer of the British alternative rock band Coldplay , on a song entitled " Homecoming " , and that it just might possibly be released as the lead single for Graduation . The collaboration occurred the year before when Kanye West and Chris Martin met one another during an impromptu jam session at the Abbey Road Studios in London , England . West had just finished performing at a show that had been held at Abbey Road and the band just so happened to be recording their music in the recording studio at exactly the same time . The song in itself is actually a re @-@ vamping for " Home ( Windy ) " , a track that originated from a demo tape dating back to the year 2001 . It was made available two years later under the new title " Home " on West 's 2003 mixtape Get Well Soon ... and also on the advance copy of West 's debut studio album The College Dropout , which due to a leak was never released . This original version possesses Kanye West 's once trademark classic soul vocal sample production style , with singer John Legend on the chorus , which contains lyrics that are different than Martin 's . This is due to the fact that Chris Martin asked Kanye West to change the song 's lyrical content . 
 Widely considered by music critics and listeners alike to be the most radio @-@ friendly track on Graduation , West defines the studio album 's third single " Good Life " as the song with the most " blatant hit @-@ <unk> " . The track features vocals from R & B singer T @-@ Pain , who utilizes the voice audio processor technology of Auto @-@ Tune . West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album The College Dropout for the background vocals on the songs " Jesus Walks " and " Never Let Me Down " . During his brief stay in Sweden , West sent through sixteen different mixes of " Good Life " over to their recording studio for the audio mastering process . West admitted that he actually did not really care for the single , but he was pressured into releasing it by his record label Def Jam Recordings . However , West has since clarified that he doesn 't retain any lingering animosity whatsoever towards his record label in regards to this . 
 Graduation started taking definite form around the time of the filming of the music video for its second single " Stronger " , whereas prior West had been " aimlessly making songs . " The music video was directed by famed music video director , film director , and screenwriter Hype Williams . The sci @-@ fi imagery of music video inspired West to take his album in a more futuristic direction . After the filming of the music video , which began before West had even written the song 's second verse , he returned to the studio to redo parts of " Stronger " and various other tracks he recorded for the album , watching films such as Total Recall for more ideas . West mixed the track seventy @-@ five times , as he could not seem to get the kick drum to sound precisely the way that he wanted it to , amongst other issues . He worked on " Stronger " with eight different audio engineers and eleven different mix engineers around the globe and recorded over fifty versions of the track . Still feeling dissatisfied after hearing the number @-@ one hit single inside a club compared alongside Timbaland 's 2007 single " The Way I Are " , which was his favorite hip @-@ hop beat at the time , West enlisted the record producer to assist him in redoing the drum programming . 
 The third studio album also sees the return of composer and multi @-@ instrumentalist Jon Brion — who had played an integral role as the co @-@ executive producer on West 's previous studio album Late Registration — for the track " Drunk and Hot Girls . " Kanye claimed that one day , while listening to " Sing Swan Song " by the German experimental @-@ rock band Can , he heard the words " drunk and hot girls " rather than the actual " <unk> hot bowls " lyrics . Rather than rap , West instead slowly sings along to the sinister song 's dreary original melody with warbled vocals . Kanye features vocal harmony during the chorus with guest artist Mos Def , who just after his voice experiences a four @-@ second audio delay , also delivers the song 's reverb @-@ filled bridge . In comparison to other tracks on the album , " Drunk and Hot Girls " was taken much less seriously during the time of its recording sessions . Mos Def can even be heard laughing in the background after a quite playful West abruptly makes a ridiculous , unhinged one @-@ liner joke that intentionally doesn 't even actually rhyme with what he said before . 
 More than any other song on the entire studio album , the epic stadium @-@ rap power ballad " I Wonder " was the most influenced by U2 . Kanye West cites it as one of this top three most favorite songs from Graduation . Kanye imparted that he had sought out to make the hip @-@ hop variation of the rock band 's " City of Blinding Lights " . West reportedly heard the snare drum which was used for the track while shopping for furniture at Moss and spent many weeks working on it . Kanye has also said that he wrote the song while thinking of performing it onstage in front of an audience of over 50 @,@ 000 people . With this in mind , he placed a significant amount of concentration on speaking at high volumes with fewer wording and initially delivers his defiant lyrics in an intense staccato vocal style . West raps the song 's three verses using single and double @-@ time rhyme schemes . He stresses each syllable in each word in the minimalist first verse . West then transitions to a faster , more fluid flow for the more intricate second and third verses . West considered the release of " I Wonder " as the album 's fourth single . But he instead chose " Flashing Lights " , which he refers to as the " coolest " track from the studio album . 
 The hip @-@ hop beat for " The Glory " was originally made for West 's GOOD Music associate , close friend , and fellow Chicago hip @-@ hop artist Common , whose seventh album Finding Forever was being produced and recorded by West simultaneously with Graduation . As was the case with both their previous albums , certain tracks that West originally crafted for Finding Forever that Common declined eventually ended up on his own studio album . " Everything I Am " was yet another song intended for Common but was passed on , a fact which West addresses within the opening lines . The record features turntable scratches contributed by famed hip @-@ hop record producer DJ Premier . After West had played the demo for " Everything I Am " over the phone for DJ Premier and asked him what he thought of it , DJ Premier then replied that he enjoyed the lyrics and the innovative beat and offered to scratch over it . When working on the track , and while following the numerous instructions that were supplied by West , DJ Premier took seven different styles of scratches , including drum breaks , then cut all of them up into different rhythms , and scattered them all throughout the track , providing West with many different ideas to choose from . 
 While written by West , who envisioned its concept and chorus while riding an elevator , the soul @-@ baring Jay @-@ Z dedication " Big Brother " stands as the only song on Graduation that he didn 't produce . The production of the track was instead handled solely by Atlanta record producer DJ Toomp . According to West 's cousin , soul singer Tony Williams , Jay @-@ Z became quite emotional after West played a part of " Big Brother " for him in the studio for the very first time . During an interview with Rolling Stone , Kanye West himself recalled that it was " a very serious moment . " When asked for his opinion , Jay @-@ Z replied that he considered " Big Brother " a fair portrayal from a little brother 's perspective . Jay @-@ Z went on to say that he also thought that the song was " brilliantly written " and believed that it was West 's best song since " Jesus Walks " as far as structure and emotion . 
 Although " Bittersweet Poetry " appears as a Japanese bonus track on Graduation , it was actually one of the very first songs crafted for Late Registration . After seeing the 2004 biographical film Ray together , Kanye West and blues @-@ rock musician John Mayer decided to collaborate on a record and immediately went back to a recording studio to compose the song " Bittersweet . " This wasn 't the first time West and Mayer collaborated with one another . The two previously worked together to make " Go ! " , the third single from Common 's sixth studio album Be , which came about when Mayer went to visit West at The Record Plant in Los Angeles . In the end , because Kanye West felt that their song did not coincide well into the overall soundscape of his second studio album , it was subsequently <unk> .

 = = = Music and style = = = 
 With Graduation , Kanye West made a departure from the warm soul samples of The College Dropout and the lush baroque @-@ pop orchestration of Late Registration . Motivated by stadium impulses , West ventured towards a more <unk> soundscape imbued with arena rock elements that explores electronic music . The musical progression arose from West touring the world in 2006 with the rock bands U2 and The <unk> Stones . The change also came about from listening to music that encompass genres such as alternative rock , indie @-@ rock , and especially house music . House music is a subgenre of electronic dance music whose origins can be traced back to Kanye West 's hometown of Chicago , Illinois . The productions of the tracks on Graduation are also unique in that they brandish European musical influences . According to Jayson Green of Stylus Magazine , West had developed a fascination with Euro @-@ disco , a European form of electronic dance music that branched off from American disco in the 1970s . Going further , a columnist for Slant Magazine claims that the album 's hip @-@ hop beats would be " European @-@ club @-@ worthy " were they stripped of the vocals . Most importantly , Green perceives that Kanye West had developed an affinity with electronic synthesizers . Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot comments on the incorporation of synthesizer sounds . From a musical standpoint , he views Graduation as " an album steeped in keyboard tones , in all their richness and variety . " Mark Pytlik of Pitchfork Media surmises that the album is exhibits a new production style , one replete with corrosive rave stabs , acerbic synth patches , and modulated electronic noises . By contrast , AllMusic 's Andy Kellman argues , " Though the synthesizer use marks a clear , conscious diversion from Kanye 's past productions , highlights ... are deeply rooted in the Kanye of old , using nostalgia @-@ inducing samples , elegant pianos and strings , and gospel choirs . " 
 West retracted much of the rich live instrumentation that had characterized his previous studio album Late Registration . He had them replaced with heavy , layered electronic synthesizers with Gothic tendencies at loud volumes throughout Graduation . West injected distorted synth @-@ chords , rave stabs , house beats , electro @-@ disco rhythms , and a wide array of audio @-@ effects into his articulate hip @-@ hop production . All the while , West buried his signature kicks and snares deep beneath the decomposing layers of synths into the bottom of the mix . Graduation contains an eclectic variety of vaguely familiar samples that were artfully manipulated by West . Though he continues to use vocal samples , West now gleans them before also pushing them underneath the synths , causing them to " sound like voices trapped in a huge machine , not like organic , subliminal connections to a mythical black @-@ music past . " As always is the case with his productions , West neither relies nor settles simply on samples alone . Instead , there lies a discernible sense of multi @-@ layered grandeur evident within each track . Even in new , unfamiliar musical surroundings , West retains both his self @-@ assurance as well as his close attention to sonic detail . Hence , the album contains a plethora of random , semi @-@ audible sounds that are challenging to notice during the first few listens . The sounds range from keyboard arpeggios to crowd cheers to hard rock guitars and act as a supplement for the atypical samples and the layered electronic synths . West filled the corners of Graduation with enough subtle instrumental flourishes and studio embellishments to warrant a repeated , close , and careful listening experience . According to Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times , the album 's subtly dark tone was a byproduct of the inevitable toll placed on West as an artist , " an innovator in a genre that he must at least partially destroy to renew " , torn between his devotion to hip @-@ hop tradition and his " restless artistic drive " : 
 Graduation 's intricate musical environments take a while to comprehend , and at times they seem at odds with West 's confrontational lyrics . But this contradictory music makes sense when heard as an attempt to express an internal struggle – between the Kanye West hip @-@ hop made and the West who can 't be contained by it or any other genre . It 's hard to stop running with the crowd , even for a trendsetter . But West is on the verge , and moving forward . 
 Despite the predominant synthetic attributes and the overall electronic aesthetic , the emphasis placed on organic string arrangements that had accentuated Late Registration remained a significant factor on Graduation . Similar to its predecessor , Graduation wasn 't restricted to the confines of conventional looping techniques typical of traditional hip @-@ hop production . Instead , West continues to implement sudden musical shifts within the multi @-@ layered song structures and express meticulously composed introductions , bridges , and codas . For his third album , West produced songs that combine hip @-@ hop beats with anthemic refrains and continues to employ his skill in layering keys , strings , and vocals to coax the melodies out of samples . According to Sean Comer of 411Mania , Graduation is an ambitious album that demonstrates West 's attentive ear to the blending of structure , melody , timing , evocative arrangement and their potential to exist comfortably alongside effective samples . Through acting as his own producer , West manages to maintain quality control over the album 's music to ensure that " his productions build momentum even when they revolve around a handful of repeated samples [ and ] nearly every song on Graduation is memorable for both its hooks and its overall sound . " And as the album progresses , its textures and the glossy sheen of its polished , synthesizer @-@ driven productions become harder and denser with every track . Under the belief that his sophomore effort had been far too indulgent , poorly arranged , and oversaturated with unnecessary sonic accoutrements , West took measures to streamline his third release . West fashioned Graduation to contain less ornate production , made the studio album completely devoid of hip @-@ hop skits , and sequenced the record in such a way that it produced a tighter , more cohesive package . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Graduation opens on a sparse note with " Good Morning " , beginning with an echoed , metronomic cowbell beat and a thumping bassline melded with a simple , <unk> synthesizer drone . The drone is drowned by the music that arrives at the chorus , which is a conflation of ambient synths and an astral backing choir crafted from a non @-@ verbal vocal sample of " Someone Saved My Life Tonight " by Elton John . " Good Morning " eventually concludes with the voice of Jay @-@ Z reiterating lyrics from " The Ruler 's Back " , the rapper 's own opening track of his sixth studio album The Blueprint . The production for " Champion " features intermittent drops and 808 @-@ handclaps and expresses a slight jazz @-@ rock influence , eschewing guitars and trumpets in favor of breezy synths . During the verses , West raps over a constant loop of the words " their eyes " while the chopped @-@ up hook is formed from the question , " Did you realize , that you were a champion ? " Both phrases are recontextualized from a line lifted from " Kid Charlemagne " by Steely Dan . The song also sports a reggae @-@ inspired bridge delivered by Connie Mitchell in a distinct toasting vocal style . The soul @-@ fired track " I Wonder " starts off with its piano @-@ based refrain , which contains samples of " My Song " by British poet Labi Siffre . It then proceeds to morph into a myriad of interlaced synths that are impacted by distorted snare drum strokes and ethereal electronic keyboards . During the bridge , the chord progression changes and the song adopts a heavy string section that emulates the melody of its synths . The composition then enters an instrumental passage and finishes off with a sweeping string arrangement . 
 " Good Life " utilizes multi @-@ tracked , interlocking vocals that harmonize with guest singer T @-@ Pain 's Auto @-@ Tuned voice . The song 's melody is based on sampled keyboards from P.Y.T. by Michael Jackson , with the tempo slightly decreased and the pitch raised to the point its sound resembles squealing shrieks . " Barry Bonds " is built on a moaning bass line and Gothic organ , while punctuated by wailing sampled from " Long Red " by Mountain . " Drunk and Hot Girls " exhibits a sluggish waltz pitched with the rhythm of an Eastern European drinking song . It contains a mix of dark orchestration and detuned electronics with elements of " Sing Swan Song " by German progressive rock band Can . West claimed that while listening to their song , he heard the words " drunk and hot girls " rather than the actual " <unk> hot bowls " lyrics . Rather than rap , West and guest artist Mos Def sing along to the song 's melody . Opening with a gradual , rising crescendo of symphonic strings , " Flashing Lights " emits synth <unk> before transforming into a moderately @-@ paced , synth @-@ driven beat . After the introduction , in which Mitchell 's processed vocals repeat the titular hook four times , West raps the two verses , each one followed by the chorus sung by Dwele coupled with the hook . Following a break , the song enters a passage where its heavily manipulated hook echoes in and out before the coda draws the composition to a close . " Stronger " is built around a sample of " Harder , Better , Faster , Stronger " by Daft Punk . 
 By being composed using nothing more than a Rhodes piano , a vocal sample , and turntable scratches , " Everything I Am " stands as the third studio album 's most minimalistic production . West marries a down @-@ tempo beat to gentle piano chords which are accentuated by soulful cooing sampled from " If We Can 't Be Lovers " by Prince Phillip Mitchell . The low @-@ key track has a scratched hook by DJ Premier formed with the vocal sample , which contains the line , " Here we go again " , that is lifted from " Bring the Noise " by Public Enemy . With its thick , heavy bass @-@ line pattern , " The Glory " is an up @-@ tempo number which revisits the " chipmunk @-@ soul " that once defined Kanye 's early production style . It displays a sped @-@ up and high @-@ pitched vocal sample of " Save The Country " by Laura Nyro accompanied by uplifting strings , keys , and an all @-@ male gospel choir . Coldplay frontman Chris Martin sings the chorus and supplies a gospel @-@ style piano motif while West raps over heavy yet buoyant drums on " Homecoming . " The chatter of a noisy , cheering crowd can inexplicably be heard lurking in the background throughout the track . The Jay @-@ Z ode " Big Brother " begins with West uttering the words , " Stadium status ... , " backed by a string orchestra , pounding drums , a distorted guitar riff and plinking piano keys . Around mid @-@ verse , the track adopts synths that mimic the melodies of the string section . Before the second verse , additional instrumentation enters ; including a heavy bass @-@ line , metallic percussion , and 808 @-@ handclaps . The studio album 's final track " Good Night " exhibits the production characteristics of West 's next musical evolution . West juxtaposes the glitchy , mechanical sound of an 8 @-@ Bit beat with the more elegant , traditional sound of a classical piano . 
 = = = Lyrical content = = = 
 In comparison to previous albums , which were largely driven by observational commentary on matters pertaining to social welfare , Graduation is more introspective in nature and addresses personal themes . West stated that he wanted to make inspirational music and placed more focus on individual perspective and experience that listeners could connect with in an attempt to create " people 's theme songs " . Dismayed that the messages behind his complex lyricism were frequently lost on listeners and didn 't carry well during live performances , West made an attempt to simplify his lyrics and use more skeletal rhyme schemes for more straightforward verses while concentrating on speaking volumes with sparser wording on Graduation . Having committed a significant amount of time towards elevating his storytelling abilities by listening to folk musicians , West manages to form a lyrical narrative within nearly every song on the album . West dedicated a majority of the album towards conducting an analysis himself and conveying his ambivalent outlook on his newfound wealth and fame . As such , West 's subversive songwriting fluctuates between playful self @-@ aggrandizement and critical self @-@ doubt . While confident , extroverted and celebratory at face value , many songs contained on Graduation were thematically distanced and retained melancholic subtext . Some music critics remarked that compounded with West 's urgent , emotive rapping style , the record sounded as if he were experiencing an existential crisis . 
 The free @-@ associative " Champion " is primarily composed of motivational lyrics , but West also briefly touches on the strained relationship he had with his father – who divorced from his mother when he was just three @-@ years @-@ old – eventually reaching the conclusion that even with their ups and downs , in the end , his father was a champion in his eyes . West described " Stronger " as an " emancipation " , as he uses the song to vent his frustration over mistakes he has made in the past . " I Wonder " carries an introspective tone , retaining a chorus about finding one 's dreams , while West uses the verses to describe the struggle a person experiences in determining the meaning behind their life and achieving those dreams . Inspired by watching Bono open stadium tours , West concentrated on speaking volumes without using too many words on the song and delivers his raps in an exuberant , staccato manner . Using the same vocal stylings , " Flashing Lights " tells the operatic narrative of man contemplating the complexities of a tragic relationship . " Can 't Tell Me Nothing " serves as West 's reflection on his fame and is characterized by bitter remorse and defiant self @-@ awareness . West begins the song by expounding his conflicted feelings regarding wealth and desire , describing a compulsion to spend that overwhelms any and all other objectives in life . He ties this into his perceived overall inability to keep himself together even as he grows into an increasingly prominent figure in the public eye . 
 West regains his lyrical dexterity on " Barry Bonds " , a competitive , though friendly battle with Lil Wayne in which the two MCs exchange braggadocios rhymes . The song uses Major League Baseball player Barry Bonds as a metaphor for West 's ability to create music hits . " Drunk and Hot Girls " is a first @-@ person narrative that illustrates a man courting an attractive intoxicated woman in a club but gets more than what he bargained for . " Everything I Am " is a song of self @-@ examination , in which West attempts to confront his fallacies by surveying the consequences of his <unk> ruminating over various ways people expect him to conduct himself . In the track , West addresses his indifference towards constructing a gangster persona , his refusal to dress and act like every other rapper , his inclination towards social commentary , and his lack of self @-@ restraint . West comes to the conclusion that while he will never be able to live up to people 's expectations and will always be <unk> flawed ; it 's all these imperfections and more that serve to make up who he is . When writing the song , West thought of a young girl in high school dealing with people coming down on her . 
 " Homecoming " serves as a heartfelt tribute to West 's hometown of Chicago , Illinois . Using an extended metaphor that personifies the city as a childhood sweetheart named Wendy , West rhymes about his love for Chicago and his guilt over leaving " her " to pursue his musical dream . The song 's opening lines lyrically paraphrase " I Used to Love <unk> " , a similarly metaphoric hip @-@ hop song made by West 's close friend and labelmate Common , who later appeared in the single 's music video . West dedicated " Big Brother " to Jay @-@ Z , whom he feels so close to that he sees him as a brother . Within the song , West dually details his love and admiration as well as his envy and antagonism towards Jay @-@ Z , metaphorically equating their relationship to that of a sibling rivalry . West also uses the song 's chorus as a subsidiary dedication to his mentor No I.D. , who first taught him how to produce music . Similar to its musicality , the songwriting characteristics of the album @-@ closing track , " Good Night " alludes to West 's next musical progression . The majority of song is composed of repetitive recitations of its choruses and bridges by Mos Def and Al Be Back . West melodically raps only one single verse in which he nostalgically reminisces over taking trips to the museum with his grandparents . As his verse draws to a close , West chastises that a person can 't dwell on the past , and charges himself with living his life like he has no tomorrow . In retrospect , with the death of his mother Donda West less than two months after the album was released in addition to the dissolution of his engagement with fiancée Alexis Phifer , the trace amounts of melancholy found scattered throughout Graduation would all but envelop West 's next studio album , 808s & Heartbreak . 
 = = Artwork = = 
 West collaborated with Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami to oversee the art direction of Graduation as well as design the cover art for the album 's accompanying singles . Often called " the Warhol of Japan " , Murakami 's surrealistic visual art is characterized by cartoonish creatures that appear friendly and cheerful at first glance , but possess dark , twisted undertones . The collaboration between the two came about when West visited Murakami 's <unk> Kiki studio in Roppongi Hills during a brief trip to Tokyo , Japan in the midst of touring the year before . The album 's artwork expresses colorful , pastel imagery influenced by Murakami 's affiliation with <unk> , a post @-@ modern art movement influenced by manga and anime . Its production process took place over the course of several weeks , with West constantly visualizing new images and emailing the ideas to Murakami and his team . Bringing the educational theme expressed by West 's previous albums to a close , the visual plotline of the images contained within the liner notes lead up to a graduation ceremony that takes places within a fictional college institution situated within a futuristic metropolis called Universe City . Murakami explained the metaphor behind the artwork saying : 
 The cover is based on Kanye 's theme of student life . School . It 's a place of dreams , of righteousness , a place to have fun . It 's also occasionally a place where you experience the rigid dogma of the human race . Kanye 's music scrapes sentimentality and aggressiveness together like sandpaper , and he uses his grooves to unleash this tornado that spins with the zeitgeist of the times . I too wanted to be swept up and spun around in that tornado . 
 The artwork 's storyline centers around " Dropout Bear " , West 's anthropomorphic teddy bear mascot . The illustrations chronicle Dropout Bear overcoming various obstacles in an effort to reach his college campus in time for his graduation ceremony . The story begins on a rainy day with Dropout being awoken by his alarm clock and running out of his apartment to his car , modeled after a DeLorean . When the car 's engine dies , he is forced to find an alternative means of transportation . Dropout attempts to hail a cab but it speeds right past him , soaking him with puddle water . He then tries to get onto a metro rail but just misses it as it pulls away . Left with no other options , Dropout is reduced to pursuing his goal on foot . As he races down sidewalks , populated by multi @-@ eyed , living mushrooms , Dropout is pursued by a monstrous rain cloud that attempts to swallow him whole . Eventually , Dropout Bear arrives at the university and makes it to his ceremony just in time to stand before his colleagues , a wide variety of anthropomorphic creatures like himself . The visual story concludes with Dropout Bear being shot out of a cannon from the university into the sky into another stratosphere on the back cover . The cover art for Graduation was cited as the fifth best album cover of the year by Rolling Stone . The designs of the album artwork were later brought to life by Takashi Murakami through the use of cel @-@ shaded animation within a three @-@ minute animated music video for " Good Morning " .

 While hosting a listening session for his second studio album Late Registration on August 3 , 2005 at Sony Music Studios , Kanye West revealed that he wanted to schedule the release of Graduation sometime around October 2006 . Several months later , on March 28 , 2007 , West appeared on the Los Angeles radio station Power 106 . He said that he was working on his third album and Common 's seventh album Finding Forever and rapped a few lyrics from one of his songs in a cappella . On May 11 , it was announced that the release date for Graduation was September 18 . West debuted the album 's lead single " Can 't Tell Me Nothing " on the New York radio station Hot 97 on May 15 . He then released a free mixtape under the same name onto the Internet on May 27 . The mixtape features preview clips of songs that would appear on Graduation and showcases various artists signed onto West 's record label GOOD Music as well as collaborations with other unaffiliated musicians . It also contains " Us <unk> " , the debut song of Child Rebel Soldier , a supergroup West formed with Lupe Fiasco and Pharrell . 
 At the end of May , Island Def Jam pushed forward the release date for Graduation up from September to an unspecified late August date , a decision that West first announced on the introductory track of his Can 't Tell Me Nothing mixtape . On July 19 , the album 's release date was changed once more and moved to September 11 , 2007 , the same US release date as rapper 50 Cent 's third studio album Curtis . When first presented with the proposal of his label moving the release date of his album yet again as well as the idea of a sales competition between him and 50 Cent , West initially expressed his indifference towards the thought , saying , " When I heard that thing about the debate , I thought that was the stupidest thing . When my album drops and 50 's album drops , everybody wins because you 're gonna get a lot of good music at the same time . " However , then Def Jam president and CEO Jay @-@ Z welcomed competition , feeling that it would be prosperous for hip @-@ hop and the date became permanent . 
 The album 's release generated much publicity over a sales competition with 50 Cent 's Curtis . Three months that were prior to the September 11 release date , West extended his gratitude towards 50 Cent for the enthusiasm and excitement the friendly competition had produced . Though confident that he would emerge victorious , West said that he would be perfectly fine with losing to 50 Cent , saying that he 'd rather , " be # 2 on that day rather than come out and be # 1 on a day nobody cares about . " In an interview for USA Today , 50 Cent expressed his view on the idea of a sales competition , stating " It 's great marketing — for Kanye West . But I sell way more records than Kanye West , and I generate way more interest than Kanye West . They think they can match us up , but they 'll find out when that week goes by and the sales come back . This is no rivalry . " On August 10 , 50 Cent confirmed during an interview with <unk> that he would end his career as a solo recording artist if Graduation were to sell more copies than Curtis in the United States . However , 50 Cent later retracted his statement within an MTV interview due to his contract agreements with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records .

 West spent a significant amount of time promoting Graduation during his trip to the United Kingdom . On August 17 , West guest starred on the British comedy @-@ variety show The Friday Night Project . He played preview versions of the songs " Big Brother " and " Champion " from his forthcoming third album while making an appearance on DJ Tim Westwood 's radio show on August 18 . Later that day , West performed at V Festival in Chelmsford , England before an audience of over 50 @,@ 000 people and again played new material from Graduation as well as a tribute cover of Amy Winehouse 's hit single " Rehab . " He then held a secret concert with Barbadian singer Rihanna for an audience of over five hundred fans and invited guests at Westminster Central Hall in London , England on August 20 . The guests were greeted by staff members wearing graduation robes and <unk> caps in reference to the title of West 's third studio album Graduation . At the end of the concert , a shower of silver confetti and ticker tape reading Touch the Sky fell from the ceiling onto the audience while the actual " Touch the Sky , " which was the fourth single from Late Registration , was played on the speakers . 
 After he returned to the United States , West joined 50 Cent onstage for a surprise performance before an audience of over 20 @,@ 000 people at a show held on August 22 in Madison Square Garden during Ciara and T.I. ' s Screamfest ' 07 tour . West performed for a benefit concert raising funds for and promoting higher education sponsored by his charity foundation on August 24 at Chicago 's House of Blues . At the concert , he provided live renditions of songs from Graduation and gave the audience a sneak peek of the early production stages of his fall Glow in the Dark Tour . On August 28 , West hosted a studio album listening session for Graduation at New World Stages in New York City . There Kanye West explained his influences and aspirations for the album and played songs over video clips taken from a variety of futuristic sci @-@ fi films , including Tron , Akira , 2046 , and 2001 : A Space Odyssey . Two days later , on the morning of August 30 , the clean version of the album leaked onto the Internet . In a survey conducted by Billboard , results displayed that an estimated 44 % of readers predicted that Graduation would sell more units over 50 Cent and Kenny Chesney . Projections for first week scans based on early store sales reports indicated towards the 575 @,@ 000 – 700 @,@ 000 range for Graduation , while Curtis was projected in the 500 @,@ 000 – 600 @,@ 000 range .

 On the first day of its release , Graduation sold over 437 @,@ 000 copies . The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart , grossing a total of over 957 @,@ 000 copies in its first week in the United States alone . Graduation became West 's second consecutive studio album to top the Billboard 200 and also debuted at number @-@ one on the album charts in the United Kingdom and Canada . It was within the very same week that " Stronger " topped the Billboard Hot 100 , selling over 205 @,@ 000 digital downloads and giving West his third number @-@ one single . Upon its release , Graduation achieved the highest first week sales week for any album in 2007 , topping Linkin Park 's Minutes to Midnight , which sold 625 @,@ 000 copies . The album was also West 's highest first sales week to date , surpassing the 860 @,@ 000 opening week of his previous album Late Registration . It registered the best first @-@ week sales totals of any record released within the last two years , with the last being West 's own Late Registration . 
 Additionally , Graduation became ranked as the 15th highest sales week for an album since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking data in 1991 , as well as the highest sales week at the time of its release for an album since 50 Cent 's The Massacre ( 2005 ) . It also set the record for the largest week of an album digitally downloaded , registering over 133 @,@ 000 paid downloads , beating Maroon 5 's previous set record of 102 @,@ 000 for It Won 't Be Soon Before Long . Graduation 's first week sales of 957 @,@ 000 and Curtis 's first week sales of 691 @,@ 000 marked only the second time ever since the inception of Nielsen SoundScan that two albums debuted within the same week with totals surpassing 623 @,@ 000 copies in the United States . The first occurrence of such an event was in September 1991 , when Guns N ' Roses conjunctively released Use Your Illusion I , which sold 685 @,@ 000 copies , and Use Your Illusion II , which sold 770 @,@ 000 copies . The first week sales totals of Graduation and Curtis have outsold the first week sales totals of Guns N ' Roses ' two albums . 50 Cent showed graciousness in regards to his defeat . In a statement released to the Associated Press , he said , " I am very excited to have participated in one of the biggest album release weeks in the last two years . Collectively , we have sold hundreds of thousands of units in our debut week . This marks a great moment for hip @-@ hop music , one that will go down in history . " After years of slumping sales , the album competition between the two releases and the resulting record breaking performances both albums demonstrated was considered to be a " fantastic day for hip @-@ hop " . 
 In its second week on the Billboard 200 , Graduation slid to number two with the release of Reba McEntire 's Reba : Duets , selling 226 @,@ 000 copies while maintaining its dominance over Curtis , which sold 143 @,@ 000 . The next week , with the releases of over 40 new albums , Graduation dropped three spaces to number five and registered 133 @,@ 300 , reaching a cumulative total of 1 @.@ 3 million copies by October 3 . Selling 92 @,@ 400 copies , the album descended two spots the following week to reach number seven .

The following week , the album began to descend once more , selling an estimated 54 @,@ 000 copies and dropping three places to reach the ninth position on October 24 . By year 's end , Graduation was the third most @-@ downloaded and best @-@ selling album of 2007 on iTunes Store . Graduation became West 's third consecutive studio album to sell over two million copies in the United States , and it was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) on October 18 , 2007 . As of June 14 , 2013 , Nielsen Soundscan reported that Graduation has since grossed over 2 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 copies in the United States . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Graduation received widely positive reviews from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 79 , based on 32 reviews . Pitchfork Media critic Mark Pytlik complimented the accessibility of West 's sonic experimentations , finding it impressive and innovative how he assembled seemingly disparate elements on the songs . Greg Tate , writing in The Village Voice , dubbed him " the most genuinely confessional MC in hip @-@ hop today " and said , " bouts of narcissism aside , Graduation contains killer pieces of production " . Stylus Magazine 's Jayson Greene said it " serves as a document of West 's maturation " and , " musically , at least , it 's the most accomplished thing he 's ever done . " In Rolling Stone , Nathan Brackett wrote of West 's evolving and increasingly experimental , genre @-@ bending production and said although he lacks Jay @-@ Z 's " formal mastery " , West has " grown as a writer ... given the lousy year hip @-@ hop has had , the music needs his <unk> @-@ out , neurotic creativity more than ever " . Josh Tyrangiel from Time wrote , " West plunders the best [ samples ] and meticulously layers every track with enough surprises that there are thrills and discoveries a dozen listens in . " 
 In a less enthusiastic review for MSN Music , Robert Christgau deemed Graduation a " minor success " in which " every single track offers up its momentary pleasures — choruses that make you say yeah on songs you 've already found wanting , confessional details and emotional <unk> on an album that still reduces to quality product when they 're over " . However , he felt West spent too much of the album rationalizing his obsession with his fame in sketchy fashion and occasionally awkward rhymes , " little stuff like his failure to convert ' this ' - ' crib ' - ' shit ' - ' live ' - ' serious ' into a rhyme " on " Champion " or " ' at bay at a distance ' into an idiom " on " Big Brother " . Dorian Lynskey from The Guardian said West often " undercuts rap cliches with wit and ambivalence " , but observed some disappointing lyrics such as on " Can 't Tell Me Nothing " , which he said revealed his limited perspective . Slant Magazine critic Eric Henderson found West 's lyrics " only transparently expressive " and said the songs ' hooks " grab your ear on the first listen ( notably bypassing your brain ) " . Dave Heaton from PopMatters felt the album is ordinary and lacks the epochal feel of Late Registration , with songs that " aren 't as richly dressed , and he doesn 't seem to be trying as hard " .

 Rolling Stone placed the album at number five on its list of their Top 50 Albums of 2007 " . Graduation was listed at number nine on the Billboard Critics ' Poll . Time listed Graduation as the tenth best album of the year . A year @-@ end poll conducted by Entertainment Weekly cited Graduation as the best album of 2007 . It was also hailed as the best album of the year by USA Today , which wrote , " The Louis Vuitton Don may major in rap , but he liberally borrows from other music schools to create a much broader soundscape . " The studio album was listed as the fourth and eighteenth best record of the year by Spin magazine and Pitchfork Media respectively . PopMatters also listed Graduation as the fourth best album of the year . Graduation was listed at number thirty @-@ five by The Observer on its best fifty albums of the year . The Daily Telegraph ranked it number fifteen on its list of " Pop CDs of the Year " , writing , " Kanye West finally grew up on this album , delivering more inventive , precision @-@ tooled hip @-@ hop but wearing a much more furrowed brow as he explored his existential anxieties . Dark and addictive . " Pitchfork Media placed Graduation at number 87 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s . Graduation was cited as the second best album of the entire decade by Complex magazine . 
 At the 50th Grammy Awards , West led the field with a total of eight nominations , including Album of the Year , Best Rap / Sung Collaboration for " Good Life " , and Best Rap Song for " Can 't Tell Me Nothing " . West received the Grammy awards for Best Rap Solo Performance for " Stronger " , Best Rap Song for " Good Life " , and finally Graduation received the award for Best Rap Album . At the 34th annual American Music Awards , West received both the awards for Favorite Rap / Hip @-@ Hop Artist as well as Favorite Rap / Hip @-@ Hop Album for Graduation . However , West offered the former to Lil Wayne , who he felt was more deserving of the award due to his musical efforts in 2008 . Praising the artistic expression prevalent throughout Graduation , the success of the third studio album 's singles , and lastly the vivid imagination of its accompanying international Glow in the Dark Tour , MTV crowned West as the year 's # 1 Hottest MC in the Game on May 16 , 2008 . 
 = = Legacy and influence = = 
 Irish rock band U2 has asserted that touring with West on their Vertigo Tour had a significant effect on their own music as well in regards to the band 's twelfth studio album No Line on the Horizon . Bono elaborated that Kanye West 's rapping inspired him to utilize more percussive consonants for his songwriting and vocal performance . West 's third studio album Graduation , particularly with its two hit singles " Stronger " and " Flashing Lights " , has been attributed to not only encouraging other hip @-@ hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music , but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro @-@ infused music in the late 2000s . In addition , tracks such as " Everything I Am " have been cited as " the best example of the soulful and introspective atmosphere that came to dominate the rap world , from Drake to The Weeknd " . West has also received praise for his ability to appeal to diverse music audiences such as indie @-@ rock listeners and rave enthusiasts without alienating his hip @-@ hop audiences . 
 The outcome of the highly publicized sales competition between 50 Cent 's Curtis and West 's Graduation has since been accredited to the decline of the gangsta rap that once dominated mainstream hip @-@ hop . The Michigan Daily columnist Adam Theisen asserts that West 's win once and for all " prove [ d ] that rap music didn 't have to conform to gangsta @-@ rap conventions to be commercially successful . " Ben Detrick of XXL cites West defeat over 50 Cent in sales as being responsible for altering the direction of hip @-@ hop and paving the way for new rappers who didn 't follow the hardcore @-@ gangster mold , writing , " If there was ever a watershed moment to indicate hip @-@ hop 's changing direction , it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales . 50 lost handily , and it was made clear that excellent <unk> trumped a lack of street @-@ life experience . Kanye led a wave of new artists — Kid Cudi , Wale , Lupe Fiasco , Kidz in the Hall , Drake — who lacked the interest or ability to create narratives about any past gunplay or drug @-@ dealing . " 
 The competition between 50 Cent and West , when the two released their studio albums on the same day , was penultimate in a series of articles that lists fifty key events in the history of R & B and hip @-@ hop music , written by Rosie Swash of The Guardian . Swash wrote that it " highlighted the diverging facets of hip @-@ hop in the last decade ; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties , while West was the thinking man 's alternative . " Similarly , according to DJBooth , while Graduation is far from being West 's best studio album , it nevertheless is a great piece of work while the outcome of its competition with 50 Cent stands as a historical moment in hip @-@ hop culture : " Graduation isn ’ t Kanye 's best , it 's very few people 's favorite , but it ’ s an incredible body of art . He ’ s literally transitioning into stardom right before our very eyes and attempting to embody that moment in time . Kanye 's victory over 50 is the bookmark for when rap changed , it was no longer ran by the gangsters , the doors opened for Drake , Kid Cudi and J. Cole . Graduation is a monument , a hip @-@ hop treasure , a Kanye classic . "

 = Addition = 
 Addition ( often signified by the plus symbol " + " ) is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic , with the others being subtraction , multiplication and division . The addition of two whole numbers is the total amount of those quantities combined . For example , in the picture on the right , there is a combination of three apples and two apples together , making a total of five apples . This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression " 3 + 2 = 5 " i.e. , " 3 add 2 is equal to 5 " . 
 Besides counting fruits , addition can also represent combining other physical objects . Using systematic generalizations , addition can also be defined on more abstract quantities , such as integers , rational numbers , real numbers and complex numbers and other abstract objects such as vectors and matrices . 
 In arithmetic , rules for addition involving fractions and negative numbers have been devised amongst others . In algebra , addition is studied more abstractly . 
 Addition has several important properties . It is commutative , meaning that order does not matter , and it is associative , meaning that when one adds more than two numbers , the order in which addition is performed does not matter ( see <unk> ) . Repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting ; addition of 0 does not change a number . Addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication . 
 Performing addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks . Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers ; the most basic task , 1 + 1 , can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some non @-@ human animals . In primary education , students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system , starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems . Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer , where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day . 
 = = Notation and terminology = = 
 Addition is written using the plus sign " + " between the terms ; that is , in infix notation . The result is expressed with an equals sign . For example , 
 <formula> ( " one plus one equals two " ) 
 <formula> ( " two plus two equals four " ) 
 <formula> ( " three plus three equals six " ) 
 <formula> ( see " associativity " below ) 
 <formula> ( see " multiplication " below ) 
 There are also situations where addition is " understood " even though no symbol appears : 
 A column of numbers , with the last number in the column underlined , usually indicates that the numbers in the column are to be added , with the sum written below the underlined number . 
 A whole number followed immediately by a fraction indicates the sum of the two , called a mixed number . For example , 
 3 ½ 
 = 3 + ½ = 
 3 @.@ 5 . 
 This notation can cause confusion since in most other contexts juxtaposition denotes multiplication instead . 
 The sum of a series of related numbers can be expressed through capital sigma notation , which compactly denotes iteration . For example , 
 <formula> 
 The numbers or the objects to be added in general addition are collectively referred to as the terms , the addends or the summands ; this terminology carries over to the summation of multiple terms . This is to be distinguished from factors , which are multiplied . Some authors call the first addend the augend . In fact , during the Renaissance , many authors did not consider the first addend an " addend " at all . Today , due to the commutative property of addition , " augend " is rarely used , and both terms are generally called addends . 
 All of the above terminology derives from Latin . " Addition " and " add " are English words derived from the Latin verb <unk> , which is in turn a compound of ad " to " and dare " to give " , from the Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European root * deh ₃ - " to give " ; thus to add is to give to . Using the <unk> suffix <unk> results in " addend " , " thing to be added " . Likewise from <unk> " to increase " , one gets " augend " , " thing to be increased " . 
 " Sum " and " summand " derive from the Latin noun summa " the highest , the top " and associated verb <unk> . This is appropriate not only because the sum of two positive numbers is greater than either , but because it was common for the ancient Greeks and Romans to add upward , contrary to the modern practice of adding downward , so that a sum was literally higher than the addends . <unk> and <unk> date back at least to Boethius , if not to earlier Roman writers such as Vitruvius and Frontinus ; Boethius also used several other terms for the addition operation . The later Middle English terms " <unk> " and " adding " were popularized by Chaucer . 
 The plus sign " + " ( Unicode : U + <unk> ; ASCII : & # 43 ; ) is an abbreviation of the Latin word et , meaning " and " . It appears in mathematical works dating back to at least 1489 . 
 = = Interpretations = = 
 Addition is used to model countless physical processes . Even for the simple case of adding natural numbers , there are many possible interpretations and even more visual representations . 
 = = = Combining sets = = = 
 Possibly the most fundamental interpretation of addition lies in combining sets : 
 When two or more disjoint collections are combined into a single collection , the number of objects in the single collection is the sum of the number of objects in the original collections . 
 This interpretation is easy to visualize , with little danger of ambiguity . It is also useful in higher mathematics ; for the rigorous definition it inspires , see Natural numbers below . However , it is not obvious how one should extend this version of addition to include fractional numbers or negative numbers . 
 One possible fix is to consider collections of objects that can be easily divided , such as pies or , still better , segmented rods . Rather than just combining collections of segments , rods can be joined end @-@ to @-@ end , which illustrates another conception of addition : adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods . 
 = = = Extending a length = = = 
 A second interpretation of addition comes from extending an initial length by a given length : 
 When an original length is extended by a given amount , the final length is the sum of the original length and the length of the extension . 
 The sum a + b can be interpreted as a binary operation that combines a and b , in an algebraic sense , or it can be interpreted as the addition of b more units to a . Under the latter interpretation , the parts of a sum a + b play asymmetric roles , and the operation a + b is viewed as applying the unary operation + b to a . Instead of calling both a and b addends , it is more appropriate to call a the augend in this case , since a plays a passive role . The unary view is also useful when discussing subtraction , because each unary addition operation has an inverse unary subtraction operation , and vice versa . 
 = = Properties = = 
 = = = Commutativity = = = 
 Addition is commutative : one can change the order of the terms in a sum , and the result is the same . Symbolically , if a and b are any two numbers , then 
 a + b = b + a . 
 The fact that addition is commutative is known as the " commutative law of addition " . This phrase suggests that there are other commutative laws : for example , there is a commutative law of multiplication . However , many binary operations are not commutative , such as subtraction and division , so it is misleading to speak of an unqualified " commutative law " . 
 = = = Associativity = = = 
 Addition is associative : when adding three or more numbers , the order of operations does not matter . 
 As an example , should the expression a + b + c be defined to mean ( a + b ) + c or a + ( b + c ) ? That addition is associative tells us that the choice of definition is irrelevant . For any three numbers a , b , and c , it is true that ( a + b ) + c 
 = a + ( b + c ) . For example , ( 1 + 2 ) + 3 = 
 3 + 3 
 = 6 = 
 1 + 5 = 1 + ( 2 + 3 ) . 
 When addition is used together with other operations , the order of operations becomes important . In the standard order of operations , addition is a lower priority than exponentiation , nth roots , multiplication and division , but is given equal priority to subtraction . 
 = = = Identity element = = = 
 When adding zero to any number , the quantity does not change ; zero is the identity element for addition , also known as the additive identity . In symbols , for any a , 
 a + 0 
 = 0 + a = 
 a . 
 This law was first identified in <unk> 's <unk> in 628 AD , although he wrote it as three separate laws , depending on whether a is negative , positive , or zero itself , and he used words rather than algebraic symbols . Later Indian mathematicians refined the concept ; around the year 830 , Mahavira wrote , " zero becomes the same as what is added to it " , corresponding to the unary statement 0 + a 
 = a . In the 12th century , Bhaskara wrote , " In the addition of cipher , or subtraction of it , the quantity , positive or negative , remains the same " , corresponding to the unary statement a + 0 = 
 a . 
 = = = Successor = = = 
 In the context of integers , addition of one also plays a special role : for any integer a , the integer ( a + 1 ) is the least integer greater than a , also known as the successor of a . For instance , 3 is the successor of 2 and 7 is the successor of 6 . Because of this succession , the value of a + b can also be seen as the <formula> successor of a , making addition iterated succession . For examples , 6 + 2 is 8 , because 8 is the successor of 7 , which is the successor of 6 , making 8 the 2nd successor of 6 . 
 = = = Units = = = 
 To numerically add physical quantities with units , they must be expressed with common units . For example , adding 50 millilitres to 150 millilitres gives 200 millilitres . However , if a measure of 5 feet is extended by 2 inches , the sum is 62 inches , since 60 inches is synonymous with 5 feet . On the other hand , it is usually meaningless to try to add 3 meters and 4 square meters , since those units are incomparable ; this sort of consideration is fundamental in dimensional analysis . 
 = = Performing addition = = 
 = = = Innate ability = = = 
 Studies on mathematical development starting around the 1980s have exploited the phenomenon of habituation : infants look longer at situations that are unexpected . A seminal experiment by Karen Wynn in 1992 involving Mickey Mouse dolls manipulated behind a screen demonstrated that five @-@ month @-@ old infants expect 1 + 1 to be 2 , and they are comparatively surprised when a physical situation seems to imply that 1 + 1 is either 1 or 3 . This finding has since been affirmed by a variety of laboratories using different methodologies . Another 1992 experiment with older toddlers , between 18 and 35 months , exploited their development of motor control by allowing them to retrieve ping @-@ pong balls from a box ; the youngest responded well for small numbers , while older subjects were able to compute sums up to 5 . 
 Even some nonhuman animals show a limited ability to add , particularly primates . In a 1995 experiment imitating Wynn 's 1992 result ( but using eggplants instead of dolls ) , rhesus macaque and cottontop tamarin monkeys performed similarly to human infants . More dramatically , after being taught the meanings of the Arabic numerals 0 through 4 , one chimpanzee was able to compute the sum of two numerals without further training . More recently , Asian elephants have demonstrated an ability to perform basic arithmetic . 
 = = = Learning addition as children = = = 
 Typically , children first master counting . When given a problem that requires that two items and three items be combined , young children model the situation with physical objects , often fingers or a drawing , and then count the total . As they gain experience , they learn or discover the strategy of " counting @-@ on " : asked to find two plus three , children count three past two , saying " three , four , five " ( usually ticking off fingers ) , and arriving at five . This strategy seems almost universal ; children can easily pick it up from peers or teachers . Most discover it independently . With additional experience , children learn to add more quickly by exploiting the commutativity of addition by counting up from the larger number , in this case starting with three and counting " four , five . " Eventually children begin to recall certain addition facts ( " number bonds " ) , either through experience or rote memorization . Once some facts are committed to memory , children begin to derive unknown facts from known ones . For example , a child asked to add six and seven may know that 6 + 6 = 12 and then reason that 6 + 7 is one more , or 13 . Such derived facts can be found very quickly and most elementary school students eventually rely on a mixture of memorized and derived facts to add fluently . 
 Different nations introduce whole numbers and arithmetic at different ages , with many countries teaching addition in pre @-@ school . However , throughout the world , addition is taught by the end of the first year of elementary school . 
 = = = = Addition table = = = = 
 Children are often presented with the addition table of pairs of numbers from 1 to 10 to memorize . Knowing this , one can perform any addition . 
 = = = Decimal system = = = 
 The prerequisite to addition in the decimal system is the fluent recall or derivation of the 100 single @-@ digit " addition facts " . One could memorize all the facts by rote , but pattern @-@ based strategies are more enlightening and , for most people , more efficient : 
 Commutative property : Mentioned above , using the pattern a + b 
 = b + a reduces the number of " addition facts " from 100 to 55 . 
 One or two more : Adding 1 or 2 is a basic task , and it can be accomplished through counting on or , ultimately , intuition . 
 Zero : Since zero is the additive identity , adding zero is trivial . Nonetheless , in the teaching of arithmetic , some students are introduced to addition as a process that always increases the addends ; word problems may help rationalize the " exception " of zero . 
 Doubles : Adding a number to itself is related to counting by two and to multiplication . Doubles facts form a backbone for many related facts , and students find them relatively easy to grasp . 
 Near @-@ doubles : Sums such as 6 + 7 = 
 13 can be quickly derived from the doubles fact 6 + 6 
 = 12 by adding one more , or from 7 + 7 = 
 14 but subtracting one . 
 Five and ten : Sums of the form 5 + x and 10 + x are usually memorized early and can be used for deriving other facts . For example , 6 + 7 
 = 13 can be derived from 5 + 7 = 
 12 by adding one more . 
 Making ten : An advanced strategy uses 10 as an intermediate for sums involving 8 or 9 ; for example , 8 + 6 
 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 
 10 + 4 = 14 . 
 As students grow older , they commit more facts to memory , and learn to derive other facts rapidly and fluently . Many students never commit all the facts to memory , but can still find any basic fact quickly . 
 = = = = Carry = = = = 
 The standard algorithm for adding <unk> numbers is to align the addends vertically and add the columns , starting from the ones column on the right . If a column exceeds ten , the extra digit is " carried " into the next column . For example , in the addition 27 + 59 
 ¹ 
 27 
 + 59 
 — — — — 
 86 
 7 + 9 = 16 , and the digit 1 is the carry . An alternate strategy starts adding from the most significant digit on the left ; this route makes carrying a little <unk> , but it is faster at getting a rough estimate of the sum . There are many alternative methods . 
 = = = = Addition of decimal fractions = = = = 
 Decimal fractions can be added by a simple modification of the above process . One aligns two decimal fractions above each other , with the decimal point in the same location . If necessary , one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal to make it the same length as the longer decimal . Finally , one performs the same addition process as above , except the decimal point is placed in the answer , exactly where it was placed in the summands . 
 As an example , 45 @.@ 1 + 4 @.@ 34 can be solved as follows : 
 4 5 . 1 0 
 + 0 4 . 3 4 
 — — — — — — — — — — — — 
 4 9 . 4 4 
 = = = = Scientific notation = = = = 
 In scientific notation , numbers are written in the form <formula> , where <formula> is the significand and <formula> is the exponential part . Addition requires two numbers in scientific notation to be represented using the same exponential part , so that the significand can be simply added or subtracted . 
 For example : 
 <formula> 
 = = = Addition in other bases = = = 
 Addition in other bases is very similar to decimal addition . As an example , one can consider addition in binary . Adding two single @-@ digit binary numbers is relatively simple , using a form of carrying : 
 0 + 0 → 0 
 0 + 1 → 1 
 1 + 0 → 1 
 1 + 1 → 0 , carry 1 ( since 1 + 1 
 = 2 = 
 0 + ( 1 × 21 ) ) 
 Adding two " 1 " digits produces a digit " 0 " , while 1 must be added to the next column . This is similar to what happens in decimal when certain single @-@ digit numbers are added together ; if the result equals or exceeds the value of the radix ( 10 ) , the digit to the left is incremented : 
 5 + 5 → 0 , carry 1 ( since 5 + 5 
 = 10 = 
 0 + ( 1 × 101 ) ) 
 7 + 9 → 6 , carry 1 ( since 7 + 9 
 = 16 = 
 6 + ( 1 × 101 ) ) 
 This is known as carrying . When the result of an addition exceeds the value of a digit , the procedure is to " carry " the excess amount divided by the radix ( that is , 10 / 10 ) to the left , adding it to the next positional value . This is correct since the next position has a weight that is higher by a factor equal to the radix . Carrying works the same way in binary : 
 1 1 1 1 1 ( carried digits ) 
 0 1 1 0 1 
 + 1 0 1 1 1 
 — — — — — — — — — — — — — 
 1 0 0 1 0 0 
 = 36
