 Chrisye has been described as " legendary " by several journalists . In their 2007 list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time , Rolling Stone Indonesia ranked Badai Pasti Berlalu first . Three of Chrisye 's solo albums were also on the list : Sabda Alam at 51 , Puspa Indah at 57 , and Resesi at 82 . Guruh Gipsy was selected as the second @-@ best album of all time . This was followed by the selection of four of his songs ( " Lilin @-@ Lilin Kecil " at number 13 , " Merpati Putih " at number 43 , " Anak <unk> " at number 72 , and " <unk> Alam " at number 90 ) as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time ; Guruh Gipsy 's song " Indonesia <unk> " placed at number 59 . In 2011 they listed Chrisye as the third @-@ greatest Indonesian musician of all time . Eros Djarot described him as having a great voice , but somewhat shy and generally unwilling to discuss social issues . 
 According to data from the Indonesian Recording Industry Association , the original Badai Pasti Berlalu is the second @-@ best @-@ selling Indonesian album of all time , with nine million copies sold between 1977 and 1993 . In 1990 the music video for " Pergilah Kasih " was the first Indonesian music video to be shown on MTV Hong Kong ; the video clip for " Sendiri Lagi " was voted the best Indonesian music video of all time in the fifth episode of Video Musik Indonesia . 
 In 2009 many Indonesian artists , including Vina Panduwinata , Ahmad Albar , D <unk> , and <unk> Munaf , performed 20 of Chrisye 's songs as a tribute in the " Chrisye : A Night to Remember " concert at the Ritz Carlton , Jakarta . The sold @-@ out concert also featured testimonials by his wife and children . Another concert , described as Chrisye 's fourth , rather than as a tribute concert , was held on 5 April 2012 . Entitled Kidung Abadi Chrisye ( Chrisye 's Eternal Ballad ) and held at Plenary Hall in the Jakarta Convention Centre , it featured a holographic representation of the singer performing with Sophia Latjuba , Once <unk> , Vina Panduwinata , and Gutawa 's daughter Gita . The concert included a new song , " Kidung Abadi " ( " Eternal Ballad " ) , written by Erwin and Gita Gutawa and made using 246 previously recorded syllables . 
 Alberthiene Endah has written two biographies of Chrisye . The first , Chrisye : <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Chrisye : a Musical Memoir ) , was published in 2007 and details his childhood , career , and struggle with cancer . The second , The Last Words of Chrisye , was released in 2010 and covers the final years of his life . Another book , Chrisye , di Mata Media , <unk> & Fans ( Chrisye , in the Eyes of the Media , Friends , & Fans ) was released in March 2012 .

 Aciu Widjaja , now President @-@ Director of Air Asia , described Chrisye as a simple man and said that one time , when he , Chrisye , and several others had gone overseas Chrisye was the only one who did not look for brand @-@ name clothing or world @-@ class restaurants ; instead he ate at a food court and bought what he felt was comfortable . In his biography , Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside <unk> well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him . Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions , including under the piano . 
 After his marriage to Yanti , she ended her singing career to become a housewife . When the couple had children , Chrisye often had little time to spend with them as he was busy performing or recording ; however , he attempted to spend as much time with them as possible . In a 1992 interview , he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents ' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family . 
 = = Partial discography = = 
 Chrisye released 31 albums during his lifetime , 1 with Guruh Gipsy , 21 studio albums , and 9 compilation albums . His solo albums after Sabda Alam all sold more than 100 @,@ 000 copies . In a 1992 interview with Kompas , Chrisye said that he fell ill after recording each of his albums , blaming the pressure to promote them . 
 Chrisye also released many singles , several of which were used as theme songs for Indonesian soap operas : " Pengalaman Pertama " was used for the serial <unk> @-@ <unk> Kok Monyet ( Very Handsome , But Like a Monkey ! ) , " Cintaku " ( " My Love " ) from the remastered Badai Pasti Berlalu was used for Gadis <unk> ( The Maiden Conqueror ) , and " <unk> Yang Kau <unk> " was used for <unk> Bulan ( Witnessed by the Moon ) .

 = Moon = 
 The Moon is Earth 's only permanent natural satellite . It is one of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System , and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits ( its primary ) . It is the second @-@ densest satellite among those whose densities are known ( after Jupiter 's satellite Io ) . 
 The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4 @.@ 5 billion years ago , not long after Earth . There are several hypotheses for its origin ; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars @-@ sized body called Theia . 
 The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth , always showing the same face , with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters . It is the second @-@ brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth 's sky after the Sun , as measured by <unk> on Earth 's surface . Its surface is actually dark ( although it can appear a very bright white ) with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt . Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have made the Moon an important cultural influence since ancient times on language , calendars , art , and mythology . 
 The Moon 's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides , body tides , and the slight lengthening of the day . The Moon 's current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth , with its apparent size in the sky almost the same as that of the Sun , resulting in the Moon covering the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse . This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the far future . The Moon 's linear distance from Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3 @.@ 82 ± 0 @.@ 07 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 504 ± 0 @.@ 028 in ) per year , but this rate is not constant . 
 The Soviet Union 's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959 ; the United States ' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date , beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968 , and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972 , with the first being Apollo 11 . These missions returned over 380 kg ( 840 lb ) of lunar rocks , which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon 's origin , the formation of its internal structure , and its subsequent history . After the Apollo 17 mission in 1972 , the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft . 
 = = Name and etymology = = 
 The usual English proper name for Earth 's natural satellite is " the Moon " . The noun moon is derived from <unk> ( around 1380 ) , which developed from <unk> ( 1135 ) , which is derived from Old English <unk> ( dating from before 725 ) , which ultimately stems from Proto @-@ Germanic * <unk> , like all Germanic language cognates . Occasionally , the name " Luna " is used , in poetry for a personified Moon , or in science fiction to distinguish it from other moons . 
 The principal modern English adjective pertaining to the Moon is lunar , derived from the Latin Luna . A less common adjective is selenic , derived from the Ancient Greek Selene ( <unk> ) , from which is derived the prefix " <unk> " ( as in <unk> ) . Both the Greek Selene and the Roman goddess Diana were alternatively called Cynthia . The names Luna , Cynthia , and Selene are reflected in terminology for lunar orbits in words such as <unk> , pericynthion , and <unk> . The name Diana is connected to dies meaning ' day ' . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Several mechanisms have been proposed for the Moon 's formation 4 @.@ 527 ± 0 @.@ 010 billion years ago , some 30 – 50 million years after the origin of the Solar System . Recent research presented by Rick Carlson indicates a slightly lower age of between 4 @.@ 40 and 4 @.@ 45 billion years . These mechanisms included the fission of the Moon from Earth 's crust through centrifugal force ( which would require too great an initial spin of Earth ) , the gravitational capture of a pre @-@ formed Moon ( which would require an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon ) , and the co @-@ formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk ( which does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon ) . These hypotheses also cannot account for the high angular momentum of the Earth – Moon system . 
 The prevailing hypothesis today is that the Earth – Moon system formed as a result of a giant impact , where a Mars @-@ sized body ( named Theia ) collided with the newly formed proto @-@ Earth , blasting material into orbit around it that accreted to form the Moon . 
 This hypothesis perhaps best explains the evidence , although not perfectly . Eighteen months prior to an October 1984 conference on lunar origins , Bill Hartmann , Roger Phillips , and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists : " You have eighteen months . Go back to your Apollo data , go back to your computer , do whatever you have to , but make up your mind . Don 't come to our conference unless you have something to say about the Moon 's birth . " At the 1984 conference at Kona , Hawaii , the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular . 
 Before the conference , there were partisans of the three " traditional " theories , plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously , and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn ’ t think the debate would ever be resolved . Afterward there were essentially only two groups : the giant impact camp and the agnostics . 
 Giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System . Computer simulations modelling a giant impact are consistent with measurements of the angular momentum of the Earth – Moon system and the small size of the lunar core . These simulations also show that most of the Moon came from the impactor , not from the proto @-@ Earth . However , more @-@ recent tests suggest more of the Moon coalesced from Earth and not the impactor . Meteorites show that other inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions to Earth , whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions . Post @-@ impact mixing of the vaporized material between the forming Earth and Moon could have equalized their isotopic compositions , although this is debated . 
 The large amount of energy released in the giant impact event and the subsequent re @-@ accretion of material in Earth orbit would have melted the outer shell of Earth , forming a magma ocean . The newly formed Moon would also have had its own lunar magma ocean ; estimates for its depth range from about 500 km ( 300 miles ) to the entire radius of the Moon ( 1 @,@ 737 km ( 1 @,@ 079 miles ) ) . 
 Despite its accuracy in explaining many lines of evidence , there are still some difficulties that are not fully explained by the giant impact hypothesis , most of them involving the Moon 's composition . 
 In 2001 , a team at the Carnegie Institute of Washington reported the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks . To their surprise , the team found that the rocks from the Apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from Earth , and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System . Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia , this observation was unexpected . In 2007 , researchers from the California Institute of Technology announced that there was less than a 1 % chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures . Published in 2012 , an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth , which conflicts with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth 's orbit or from Theia . Variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 = = = Internal structure = = = 
 The Moon is a differentiated body : it has a geochemically distinct crust , mantle , and core . The Moon has a solid iron @-@ rich inner core with a radius of 240 km ( 150 mi ) and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 km ( 190 mi ) . Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 km ( 310 mi ) . This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon 's formation 4 @.@ 5 billion years ago . Crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine , clinopyroxene , and orthopyroxene ; after about three @-@ quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised , lower @-@ density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust on top . The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle , with a high abundance of incompatible and heat @-@ producing elements . Consistent with this , geochemical mapping from orbit shows the crust is mostly anorthosite , and moon rock samples of the flood lavas erupted on the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition , which is more iron rich than that of Earth . Geophysical techniques suggest that the crust is on average circa 50 km ( 31 mi ) thick . 
 The Moon is the second densest satellite in the Solar System after Io . However , the inner core of the Moon is small , with a radius of about 350 km ( 220 mi ) or less , around 20 % of the radius of the Moon . Its composition is not well constrained , but it is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel ; analyses of the Moon 's time @-@ variable rotation indicate that it is at least partly molten . 
 = = = Surface geology = = = 
 The topography of the Moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis . The most visible topographic feature is the giant far @-@ side South Pole – Aitken basin , some 2 @,@ 240 km ( 1 @,@ 390 mi ) in diameter , the largest crater on the Moon and the second @-@ largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System . At 13 km ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) deep , its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the Moon . The highest elevations on the surface of the Moon are located directly to the northeast , and it has been suggested that this area might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole – Aitken basin . Other large impact basins , such as Imbrium , <unk> , Crisium , <unk> , and Orientale , also possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims . The lunar far side is on average about 1 @.@ 9 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) higher than the near side . 
 = = = = Volcanic features = = = = 
 The dark and relatively featureless lunar plains that can clearly be seen with the naked eye are called maria ( Latin for " seas " ; singular mare ) , because they were believed by ancient astronomers to be filled with water . They are now known to be vast solidified pools of ancient basaltic lava . Although similar to terrestrial basalts , lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water . The majority of these lavas erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with impact basins . Several geologic provinces containing shield volcanoes and volcanic domes are found within the near side maria . 
 Almost all maria are on the near side of the Moon , covering 31 % of the surface on the near side , compared with a few scattered patches on the far side covering only 2 % . This is thought to be due to a concentration of heat @-@ producing elements under the crust on the near side , seen on geochemical maps obtained by Lunar Prospector 's gamma @-@ ray spectrometer , which would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up , partially melt , rise to the surface and erupt . Most of the Moon 's mare basalts erupted during the <unk> period , 3 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 5 billion years ago , although some radiometrically dated samples are as old as 4 @.@ 2 billion years . Until recently , the youngest eruptions , dated by crater counting , appeared to have been only 1 @.@ 2 billion years ago . In 2006 , a study of Ina , a tiny depression in Lacus <unk> , found jagged , relatively dust @-@ free features that , due to the lack of erosion by infalling debris , appeared to be only 2 million years old . <unk> and releases of gas also indicate some continued lunar activity . In 2014 NASA announced " widespread evidence of young lunar volcanism " at 70 irregular mare patches identified by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , some less than 50 million years old . This raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed , at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer due to the greater concentration of radioactive elements . Just prior to this , evidence has been presented for 2 – 10 million years younger basaltic volcanism inside Lowell crater , Orientale basin , located in the transition zone between the near and far sides of the Moon . An initially hotter mantle and / or local enrichment of heat @-@ producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities also on the far side in the Orientale basin . 
 The lighter @-@ coloured regions of the Moon are called terrae , or more commonly highlands , because they are higher than most maria . They have been radiometrically dated to having formed 4 @.@ 4 billion years ago , and may represent plagioclase <unk> of the lunar magma ocean . In contrast to Earth , no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events . 
 The concentration of maria on the Near Side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side , which may have formed in a slow @-@ velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after their formation . 
 = = = = Impact craters = = = = 
 The other major geologic process that has affected the Moon 's surface is impact cratering , with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface . There are estimated to be roughly 300 @,@ 000 craters wider than 1 km ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) on the Moon 's near side alone . Some of these are named for scholars , scientists , artists and explorers . The lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events , including Nectaris , Imbrium , and Orientale , structures characterized by multiple rings of uplifted material , typically hundreds to thousands of kilometres in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon . The lack of an atmosphere , weather and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well @-@ preserved . Although only a few multi @-@ ring basins have been definitively dated , they are useful for assigning relative ages . Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate , counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface . The radiometric ages of impact @-@ melted rocks collected during the Apollo missions cluster between 3 @.@ 8 and 4 @.@ 1 billion years old : this has been used to propose a Late Heavy Bombardment of impacts . 
 <unk> on top of the Moon 's crust is a highly comminuted ( broken into ever smaller particles ) and impact gardened surface layer called regolith , formed by impact processes . The finer regolith , the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass , has a texture resembling snow and a scent resembling spent gunpowder . The regolith of older surfaces is generally thicker than for younger surfaces : it varies in thickness from 10 – 20 km ( 6 @.@ 2 – 12 @.@ 4 mi ) in the highlands and 3 – 5 km ( 1 @.@ 9 – 3 @.@ 1 mi ) in the maria . Beneath the finely comminuted regolith layer is the megaregolith , a layer of highly fractured bedrock many kilometres thick . 
 = = = = Lunar swirls = = = = 
 Lunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the Moon ’ s surface , which are characterized by having a high albedo , appearing optically immature ( i.e. having the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith ) , and ( often ) having a sinuous shape . Their curvilinear shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls . 
 = = = = Presence of water = = = = 
 Liquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface . When exposed to solar radiation , water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space . However , since the 1960s , scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen @-@ rich lunar rocks , and hydrogen from solar wind , leaving traces of water which could possibly survive in cold , permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the Moon . Computer simulations suggest that up to 14 @,@ 000 km2 ( 5 @,@ 400 sq mi ) of the surface may be in permanent shadow . The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a cost @-@ effective plan ; the alternative of transporting water from Earth would be prohibitively expensive . 
 In years since , signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface . In 1994 , the <unk> radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft , indicated the existence of small , frozen pockets of water close to the surface . However , later radar observations by Arecibo , suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters . In 1998 , the neutron spectrometer located on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft , indicated that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions . In 2008 , an analysis of volcanic lava beads , brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15 , showed small amounts of water to exist in the interior of the beads . 
 The 2008 Chandrayaan @-@ 1 spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice , using the on @-@ board Moon Mineralogy <unk> . The spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl , in reflected sunlight , providing evidence of large quantities of water ice , on the lunar surface . The spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as 1 @,@ 000 ppm . In 2009 , LCROSS sent a 2 @,@ 300 kg ( 5 @,@ 100 lb ) impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater , and detected at least 100 kg ( 220 lb ) of water in a plume of ejected material . Another examination of the LCROSS data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to 155 ± 12 kg ( 342 ± 26 lb ) . 
 In May 2011 , Erik Hauri et al. reported 615 – 1410 ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample <unk> , the famous high @-@ titanium " orange glass soil " of volcanic origin collected during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972 . The inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the Moon approximately 3 @.@ 7 billion years ago . This concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earth 's upper mantle . Although of considerable <unk> interest , Hauri 's announcement affords little comfort to would @-@ be lunar colonists — the sample originated many kilometers below the surface , and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art ion <unk> instrument . 
 = = = Gravitational field = = = 
 The gravitational field of the Moon has been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft . The main lunar gravity features are <unk> , large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins , partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill these basins . These anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon . There are some puzzles : lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature , and some <unk> exist that are not linked to mare volcanism . 
 = = = Magnetic field = = = 
 The Moon has an external magnetic field of about 1 – 100 <unk> , less than one @-@ hundredth that of Earth . It does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization , probably acquired early in lunar history when a dynamo was still operating . Alternatively , some of the remnant magnetization may be from transient magnetic fields generated during large impact events , through the expansion of an impact @-@ generated plasma cloud in the presence of an ambient magnetic field — this is supported by the apparent location of the largest crustal <unk> near the antipodes of the giant impact basins . 
 = = = Atmosphere = = = 
 The Moon has an atmosphere so tenuous as to be nearly vacuum , with a total mass of less than 10 metric tons ( 9 @.@ 8 long tons ; 11 short tons ) . The surface pressure of this small mass is around 3 × 10 − 15 atm ( 0 @.@ 3 <unk> ) ; it varies with the lunar day . Its sources include outgassing and sputtering , the release of atoms from the bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions . Elements that have been detected include sodium and potassium , produced by sputtering , which are also found in the atmospheres of Mercury and Io ; helium @-@ 4 and neon from the solar wind ; and argon @-@ 40 , radon @-@ 222 , and polonium @-@ 210 , <unk> after their creation by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle . The absence of such neutral species ( atoms or molecules ) as oxygen , nitrogen , carbon , hydrogen and magnesium , which are present in the regolith , is not understood . Water vapour has been detected by Chandrayaan @-@ 1 and found to vary with latitude , with a maximum at ~ 60 – 70 degrees ; it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith . These gases can either return into the regolith due to the Moon 's gravity or be lost to space , either through solar radiation pressure or , if they are ionized , by being swept away by the solar wind 's magnetic field . 
 = = = = Dust = = = = 
 A permanent asymmetric moon dust cloud exists around the Moon , created by small particles from comets . Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon 's surface each 24 hours . The particles strike the Moon 's surface ejecting moon dust above the Moon . The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes , taking 5 minutes to rise , and 5 minutes to fall . On average , 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon , rising to 100 kilometers above the surface . The dust measurements were made by LADEE 's Lunar Dust <unk> ( <unk> ) , between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface , during a six @-@ month period . <unk> detected an average of one 0 @.@ 3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute . Dust particle counts peaked during the <unk> , <unk> , Northern Taurid , and Omicron <unk> meteor showers , when the Earth , and Moon , pass through comet debris . The cloud is asymmetric , more dense near the boundary between the Moon 's dayside and nightside . 
 = = = Seasons = = = 
 The Moon 's axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is only 1 @.@ <unk> ° , much less than the 23 @.@ 44 ° of Earth . Because of this , the Moon 's solar illumination varies much less with season , and topographical details play a crucial role in seasonal effects . From images taken by Clementine in 1994 , it appears that four mountainous regions on the rim of Peary Crater at the Moon 's north pole may remain illuminated for the entire lunar day , creating peaks of eternal light . No such regions exist at the south pole . Similarly , there are places that remain in permanent shadow at the bottoms of many polar craters , and these dark craters are extremely cold : Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter measured the lowest summer temperatures in craters at the southern pole at 35 K ( − 238 ° C ; − 397 ° F ) and just 26 K ( − 247 ° C ; − 413 ° F ) close to the winter solstice in north polar <unk> Crater . This is the coldest temperature in the Solar System ever measured by a spacecraft , colder even than the surface of Pluto . Average temperatures of the Moon 's surface are reported , but temperatures of different areas will vary greatly depending upon whether a spot is in sunlight or in shadow . 
 = = Relationship to Earth = = 
 = = = Orbit = = = 
 The Moon makes a complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars about once every 27 @.@ 3 days ( its sidereal period ) . However , because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same time , it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth , which is about 29 @.@ 5 days ( its synodic period ) . Unlike most satellites of other planets , the Moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet 's equatorial plane . The Moon 's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small , complex and interacting ways . For example , the plane of the Moon 's orbital motion gradually rotates , which affects other aspects of lunar motion . These follow @-@ on effects are mathematically described by Cassini 's laws . 
 = = = Relative size = = = 
 The Moon is exceptionally large relative to Earth : a quarter its diameter and 1 / 81 its mass . It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet , though Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto , at 1 / 9 Pluto 's mass . Earth and the Moon are nevertheless still considered a planet – satellite system , rather than a double planet , because their barycentre , the common centre of mass , is located 1 @,@ 700 km ( 1 @,@ 100 mi ) ( about a quarter of Earth 's radius ) beneath Earth 's surface . 
 = = = Appearance from Earth = = = 
 The Moon is in synchronous rotation : it rotates about its axis in about the same time it takes to orbit Earth . This results in it nearly always keeping the same face turned towards Earth . The Moon used to rotate at a faster rate , but early in its history , its rotation slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation as a result of frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by Earth . The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the near side , and the opposite side the far side . The far side is often inaccurately called the " dark side " , but in fact , it is illuminated as often as the near side : once per lunar day , during the new moon phase we observe on Earth when the near side is dark . In 2016 , planetary scientists , using data collected on the much earlier <unk> Lunar Prospector mission , found two hydrogen @-@ rich areas on opposite sides of the Moon , probably in the form of water ice . It is speculated that these patches were the poles of the Moon billions of years ago , before it was tidally locked to Earth . 
 The Moon has an exceptionally low albedo , giving it a reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt . Despite this , it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun . This is partly due to the brightness enhancement of the opposition effect ; at quarter phase , the Moon is only one @-@ tenth as bright , rather than half as bright , as at full moon . 
 Additionally , colour constancy in the visual system <unk> the relations between the colours of an object and its surroundings , and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark , the sunlit Moon is perceived as a bright object . The edges of the full moon seem as bright as the centre , with no limb darkening , due to the reflective properties of lunar soil , which reflects more light back towards the Sun than in other directions . The Moon does appear larger when close to the horizon , but this is a purely psychological effect , known as the Moon illusion , first described in the 7th century BC . The full moon subtends an arc of about 0 @.@ 52 ° ( on average ) in the sky , roughly the same apparent size as the Sun ( see § Eclipses ) . 
 The highest altitude of the Moon in the sky varies with the lunar phase and the season of the year . The full moon is highest during winter . The 18 @.@ 6 @-@ year nodes cycle also has an influence : when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox , the lunar declination can go as far as 28 ° each month . This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28 ° from the equator , instead of only 18 ° . The orientation of the Moon 's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site : close to the equator , an observer can see a smile @-@ shaped crescent moon . 
 The moon is visible for two weeks every 27 @.@ 3 days at the North and South Pole . The moon 's light is used by zooplankton in the Arctic when the sun is below the horizon for months on end . 
 The distance between the Moon and Earth varies from around 356 @,@ 400 km ( 221 @,@ 500 mi ) to 406 @,@ 700 km ( 252 @,@ 700 mi ) at <unk> ( closest ) and <unk> ( farthest ) , respectively . On 19 March 2011 , it was closer to Earth when at full phase than it has been since 1993 , 14 % closer than its farthest position in apogee . Reported as a " super moon " , this closest point coincides within an hour of a full moon , and it was 30 % more luminous than when at its greatest distance due to its angular diameter being 14 % greater , because <formula> . At lower levels , the human perception of reduced brightness as a percentage is provided by the following formula : 
 <formula> 
 When the actual reduction is 1 @.@ 00 / 1 @.@ 30 , or about 0 @.@ 770 , the perceived reduction is about 0 @.@ 877 , or 1 @.@ 00 / 1 @.@ 14 . This gives a maximum perceived increase of 14 % between apogee and perigee moons of the same phase . 
 There has been historical controversy over whether features on the Moon 's surface change over time . Today , many of these claims are thought to be illusory , resulting from observation under different lighting conditions , poor astronomical seeing , or inadequate drawings . However , outgassing does occasionally occur , and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena . Recently , it has been suggested that a roughly 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago . The Moon 's appearance , like that of the Sun , can be affected by Earth 's atmosphere : common effects are a 22 ° halo ring formed when the Moon 's light is refracted through the ice crystals of high cirrostratus cloud , and smaller coronal rings when the Moon is seen through thin clouds . 
 The illuminated area of the visible sphere ( degree of illumination ) is given by <formula> , where <formula> is the elongation ( i.e. the angle between Moon , the observer ( on Earth ) and the Sun ) . 
 = = = Tidal effects = = = 
 The tides on Earth are mostly generated by the gradient in intensity of the Moon 's gravitational pull from one side of Earth to the other , the tidal forces . This forms two tidal bulges on Earth , which are most clearly seen in elevated sea level as ocean tides . Because Earth spins about 27 times faster than the Moon moves around it , the bulges are dragged along with Earth 's surface faster than the Moon moves , rotating around Earth once a day as it spins on its axis . The ocean tides are magnified by other effects : frictional coupling of water to Earth 's rotation through the ocean floors , the inertia of water 's movement , ocean basins that get shallower near land , and oscillations between different ocean basins . The tidal effect of the Sun on Earth 's oceans is almost half that of the Moon , and their gravitational interplay is responsible for spring and neap tides . 
 Gravitational coupling between the Moon and the bulge nearest the Moon acts as a torque on Earth 's rotation , draining angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from Earth 's spin . In turn , angular momentum is added to the Moon 's orbit in a process confusingly known as tidal acceleration , which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit with a lower orbital speed and a longer period . Thus the distance between Earth and Moon is increasing , and Earth 's spin is slowing down . Measurements from lunar ranging experiments with laser reflectors left during the Apollo missions have found that the Moon 's distance to Earth increases by 38 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) per year ( roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow ) . Atomic clocks also show that Earth 's day lengthens by about 15 microseconds every year , slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds . Left to run its course , this tidal drag would continue until the spin of Earth and the orbital period of the Moon matched , creating mutual tidal locking between the two , as is already currently the case with Pluto and its moon Charon . However , the Sun will become a red giant long before that , engulfing Earth . 
 The lunar surface also experiences tides of around 10 cm ( 4 in ) amplitude over 27 days , with two components : a fixed one due to Earth , because they are in synchronous rotation , and a varying component from the Sun . The Earth @-@ induced component arises from libration , a result of the Moon 's orbital eccentricity ; if the Moon 's orbit were perfectly circular , there would only be solar tides . <unk> also changes the angle from which the Moon is seen , allowing about 59 % of its surface to be seen from Earth ( but only half at any instant ) . The cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes . <unk> are much less common and weaker than earthquakes , although they can last for up to an hour — a significantly longer time than terrestrial earthquakes — because of the absence of water to damp out the seismic vibrations . The existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972 . 
 = = = Eclipses = = = 
 Eclipses can only occur when the Sun , Earth , and Moon are all in a straight line ( termed " syzygy " ) . Solar eclipses occur at new moon , when the Moon is between the Sun and Earth . In contrast , lunar eclipses occur at full moon , when Earth is between the Sun and Moon . The apparent size of the Moon is roughly the same as that of the Sun , with both being viewed at close to one @-@ half a degree wide . The Sun is much larger than the Moon but it is the precise vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller Moon from the perspective of Earth . The variations in apparent size , due to the non @-@ circular orbits , are nearly the same as well , though occurring in different cycles . This makes possible both total ( with the Moon appearing larger than the Sun ) and annular ( with the Moon appearing smaller than the Sun ) solar eclipses . In a total eclipse , the Moon completely covers the disc of the Sun and the solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye . Because the distance between the Moon and Earth is very slowly increasing over time , the angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing . Also , as it evolves toward becoming a red giant , the size of the Sun , and its apparent diameter in the sky , are slowly increasing . The combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago , the Moon would always completely cover the Sun on solar eclipses , and no annular eclipses were possible . Likewise , hundreds of millions of years in the future , the Moon will no longer cover the Sun completely , and total solar eclipses will not occur . 
 Because the Moon 's orbit around Earth is inclined by about 5 ° to the orbit of Earth around the Sun , eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon . For an eclipse to occur , the Moon must be near the intersection of the two orbital planes . The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon , and of the Moon by Earth , is described by the saros , which has a period of approximately 18 years . 
 Because the Moon is continuously blocking our view of a half @-@ degree @-@ wide circular area of the sky , the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted : hidden from view . In this way , a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun . Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth , occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet , nor at the same time . Because of the precession of the lunar orbit , each year different stars are occulted .

 Understanding of the Moon 's cycles was an early development of astronomy : by the 5th century BC , Babylonian astronomers had recorded the 18 @-@ year Saros cycle of lunar eclipses , and Indian astronomers had described the Moon 's monthly elongation . The Chinese astronomer Shi Shen ( fl . 4th century BC ) gave instructions for predicting solar and lunar eclipses . Later , the physical form of the Moon and the cause of moonlight became understood . The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras ( d . 428 BC ) reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks , and that the latter reflected the light of the former . Although the Chinese of the Han Dynasty believed the Moon to be energy equated to qi , their ' radiating influence ' theory also recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun , and Jing Fang ( 78 – 37 BC ) noted the sphericity of the Moon . In the 2nd century AD Lucian wrote a novel where the heroes travel to the Moon , which is inhabited . In 499 AD , the Indian astronomer Aryabhata mentioned in his <unk> that reflected sunlight is the cause of the shining of the Moon . The astronomer and physicist Alhazen ( 965 – 1039 ) found that sunlight was not reflected from the Moon like a mirror , but that light was emitted from every part of the Moon 's sunlit surface in all directions . Shen Kuo ( 1031 – 1095 ) of the Song dynasty created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the Moon to a round ball of reflective silver that , when doused with white powder and viewed from the side , would appear to be a crescent . 
 In Aristotle 's ( 384 – 322 BC ) description of the universe , the Moon marked the boundary between the spheres of the mutable elements ( earth , water , air and fire ) , and the imperishable stars of aether , an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries . However , in the 2nd century BC , Seleucus of Seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the Moon , and that their height depends on the Moon 's position relative to the Sun . In the same century , Aristarchus computed the size and distance of the Moon from Earth , obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of Earth for the distance . These figures were greatly improved by Ptolemy ( 90 – 168 AD ) : his values of a mean distance of 59 times Earth 's radius and a diameter of 0 @.@ 292 Earth diameters were close to the correct values of about 60 and 0 @.@ 273 respectively . Archimedes ( 287 – 212 BC ) designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of the Moon and other objects in the Solar System . 
 During the Middle Ages , before the invention of the telescope , the Moon was increasingly recognised as a sphere , though many believed that it was " perfectly smooth " . 
 In 1609 , Galileo Galilei drew one of the first telescopic drawings of the Moon in his book Sidereus Nuncius and noted that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters . Telescopic mapping of the Moon followed : later in the 17th century , the efforts of Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi led to the system of naming of lunar features in use today . The more exact 1834 – 36 Mappa <unk> of Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich Mädler , and their associated 1837 book Der Mond , the first <unk> accurate study of lunar features , included the heights of more than a thousand mountains , and introduced the study of the Moon at accuracies possible in earthly geography . Lunar craters , first noted by Galileo , were thought to be volcanic until the 1870s proposal of Richard Proctor that they were formed by collisions . This view gained support in 1892 from the experimentation of geologist Grove Karl Gilbert , and from comparative studies from 1920 to the 1940s , leading to the development of lunar stratigraphy , which by the 1950s was becoming a new and growing branch of <unk> .

 The Cold War @-@ inspired Space Race between the Soviet Union and the U.S. led to an acceleration of interest in exploration of the Moon . Once launchers had the necessary capabilities , these nations sent unmanned probes on both flyby and impact / lander missions . Spacecraft from the Soviet Union 's Luna program were the first to accomplish a number of goals : following three unnamed , failed missions in 1958 , the first human @-@ made object to escape Earth 's gravity and pass near the Moon was Luna 1 ; the first human @-@ made object to impact the lunar surface was Luna 2 , and the first photographs of the normally occluded far side of the Moon were made by Luna 3 , all in 1959 . 
 The first spacecraft to perform a successful lunar soft landing was Luna 9 and the first unmanned vehicle to orbit the Moon was Luna 10 , both in 1966 . Rock and soil samples were brought back to Earth by three Luna sample return missions ( Luna 16 in 1970 , Luna 20 in 1972 , and Luna 24 in 1976 ) , which returned 0 @.@ 3 kg total . Two pioneering robotic rovers landed on the Moon in 1970 and 1973 as a part of Soviet Lunokhod programme . 
 = = = = = United States missions = = = = = 
 The United States launched unmanned probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface for an eventual manned landing : the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 's Ranger program produced the first close @-@ up pictures ; the Lunar Orbiter program produced maps of the entire Moon ; the Surveyor program landed its first spacecraft four months after Luna 9 . NASA 's manned Apollo program was developed in parallel ; after a series of unmanned and manned tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit , and spurred on by a potential Soviet lunar flight , in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first crewed mission to lunar orbit . The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the Space Race . 
 Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon as the commander of the American mission Apollo 11 by first setting foot on the Moon at 02 : 56 UTC on 21 July 1969 . An estimated 500 million people worldwide watched the transmission by the Apollo TV camera , the largest television audience for a live broadcast at that time . The Apollo missions 11 to 17 ( except Apollo 13 , which aborted its planned lunar landing ) returned 380 @.@ 05 kilograms ( 837 @.@ 87 lb ) of lunar rock and soil in 2 @,@ 196 separate samples . The American Moon landing and return was enabled by considerable technological advances in the early 1960s , in domains such as ablation chemistry , software engineering and atmospheric re @-@ entry technology , and by highly competent management of the enormous technical undertaking . 
 Scientific instrument packages were installed on the lunar surface during all the Apollo landings . Long @-@ lived instrument stations , including heat flow probes , seismometers , and magnetometers , were installed at the Apollo 12 , 14 , 15 , 16 , and 17 landing sites . Direct transmission of data to Earth concluded in late 1977 due to budgetary considerations , but as the stations ' lunar laser ranging corner @-@ cube <unk> arrays are passive instruments , they are still being used . Ranging to the stations is routinely performed from Earth @-@ based stations with an accuracy of a few centimetres , and data from this experiment are being used to place constraints on the size of the lunar core .

 After the first moon race there were years of near quietude but starting in the 1990s , many more countries have become involved in direct exploration of the Moon . In 1990 , Japan became the third country to place a spacecraft into lunar orbit with its Hiten spacecraft . The spacecraft released a smaller probe , Hagoromo , in lunar orbit , but the transmitter failed , preventing further scientific use of the mission . In 1994 , the U.S. sent the joint Defense Department / NASA spacecraft Clementine to lunar orbit . This mission obtained the first near @-@ global topographic map of the Moon , and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface . This was followed in 1998 by the Lunar Prospector mission , whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles , which is likely to have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters . 
 India , Japan , China , the United States , and the European Space Agency each sent lunar orbiters , especially ISRO 's Chandrayaan @-@ 1 has contributed to confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith . The post @-@ Apollo era has also seen two rover missions : the final Soviet Lunokhod mission in 1973 , and China 's ongoing Chang 'e 3 mission , which deployed its Yutu rover on 14 December 2013 . The Moon remains , under the Outer Space Treaty , free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes .

 The European spacecraft SMART @-@ 1 , the second ion @-@ propelled spacecraft , was in lunar orbit from 15 November 2004 until its lunar impact on 3 September 2006 , and made the first detailed survey of chemical elements on the lunar surface . 
 China has pursued an ambitious program of lunar exploration , beginning with Chang 'e 1 , which successfully orbited the Moon from 5 November 2007 until its controlled lunar impact on 1 March 2009 . In its sixteen @-@ month mission , it obtained a full image map of the Moon . China followed up this success with Chang 'e 2 beginning in October 2010 , which reached the Moon over twice as fast as Chang 'e 1 , mapped the Moon at a higher resolution over an eight @-@ month period , then left lunar orbit in favor of an extended stay at the Earth – Sun L2 Lagrangian point , before finally performing a flyby of asteroid <unk> <unk> on 13 December 2012 , and then heading off into deep space . On 14 December 2013 , Chang 'e 3 improved upon its orbital mission predecessors by landing a lunar lander onto the Moon 's surface , which in turn deployed a lunar rover , named Yutu ( Chinese : <unk> ; literally " Jade Rabbit " ) . In so doing , Chang 'e 3 made the first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 in 1976 , and the first lunar rover mission since Lunokhod 2 in 1973 . China intends to launch another rover mission ( Chang 'e 4 ) before 2020 , followed by a sample return mission ( Chang 'e 5 ) soon after . 
 Between 4 October 2007 and 10 June 2009 , the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency 's Kaguya ( Selene ) mission , a lunar orbiter fitted with a high @-@ definition video camera , and two small radio @-@ transmitter satellites , obtained lunar geophysics data and took the first high @-@ definition movies from beyond Earth orbit . India 's first lunar mission , Chandrayaan I , orbited from 8 November 2008 until loss of contact on 27 August 2009 , creating a high resolution chemical , mineralogical and photo @-@ geological map of the lunar surface , and confirming the presence of water molecules in lunar soil . The Indian Space Research Organisation planned to launch Chandrayaan II in 2013 , which would have included a Russian robotic lunar rover . However , the failure of Russia 's <unk> @-@ Grunt mission has delayed this project . 
 The U.S. co @-@ launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) and the LCROSS impactor and follow @-@ up observation orbiter on 18 June 2009 ; LCROSS completed its mission by making a planned and widely observed impact in the crater <unk> on 9 October 2009 , whereas LRO is currently in operation , obtaining precise lunar altimetry and high @-@ resolution imagery . In November 2011 , the LRO passed over the Aristarchus crater , which spans 40 km ( 25 mi ) and sinks more than 3 @.@ 5 km ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) deep . The crater is one of the most visible ones from Earth . " The Aristarchus plateau is one of the most geologically diverse places on the Moon : a mysterious raised flat plateau , a giant <unk> carved by enormous outpourings of lava , fields of explosive volcanic ash , and all surrounded by massive flood basalts " , said Mark Robinson , principal investigator of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera at Arizona State University . NASA released photos of the crater on 25 December 2011 . 
 Two NASA <unk> spacecraft began orbiting the Moon around 1 January 2012 , on a mission to learn more about the Moon 's internal structure . NASA 's LADEE probe , designed to study the lunar exosphere , achieved orbit on 6 October 2013 . 
 Upcoming lunar missions include Russia 's Luna @-@ Glob : an unmanned lander with a set of seismometers , and an orbiter based on its failed Martian <unk> @-@ Grunt mission . Privately funded lunar exploration has been promoted by the Google Lunar X Prize , announced 13 September 2007 , which offers US $ 20 million to anyone who can land a robotic rover on the Moon and meet other specified criteria . Shackleton Energy Company is building a program to establish operations on the south pole of the Moon to harvest water and supply their Propellant Depots . 
 NASA began to plan to resume manned missions following the call by U.S. President George W. Bush on 14 January 2004 for a manned mission to the Moon by 2019 and the construction of a lunar base by 2024 . The Constellation program was funded and construction and testing begun on a manned spacecraft and launch vehicle , and design studies for a lunar base . However , that program has been cancelled in favor of a manned asteroid landing by 2025 and a manned Mars orbit by 2035 . India has also expressed its hope to send a manned mission to the Moon by 2020 . 
 = = Astronomy from the Moon = = 
 For many years , the Moon has been recognized as an excellent site for telescopes . It is relatively nearby ; astronomical seeing is not a concern ; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold , and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes ; and radio telescopes on the far side would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth . The lunar soil , although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes , can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter . A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid . 
 In April 1972 , the Apollo 16 mission recorded various astronomical photos and spectra in ultraviolet with the Far Ultraviolet Camera / Spectrograph .

 During the Cold War , the United States Army conducted a classified feasibility study in the late 1950s called Project Horizon , to construct a manned military outpost on the Moon , which would have been home to a bombing system targeted at rivals on Earth . The study included the possibility of conducting a lunar @-@ based nuclear test . The Air Force , which at the time was in competition with the Army for a leading role in the space program , developed its own , similar plan called <unk> . However , both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency NASA . 
 Although Luna landers scattered pennants of the Soviet Union on the Moon , and U.S. flags were symbolically planted at their landing sites by the Apollo astronauts , no nation claims ownership of any part of the Moon 's surface . Russia and the U.S. are party to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty , which defines the Moon and all outer space as the " province of all mankind " . This treaty also restricts the use of the Moon to peaceful purposes , explicitly banning military installations and weapons of mass destruction . The 1979 Moon Agreement was created to restrict the exploitation of the Moon 's resources by any single nation , but as of 2014 , it has been signed and ratified by only 16 nations , none of which engages in self @-@ launched human space exploration or has plans to do so . Although several individuals have made claims to the Moon in whole or in part , none of these are considered credible .

 The Moon 's regular phases make it a very convenient timepiece , and the periods of its waxing and waning form the basis of many of the oldest calendars . Tally sticks , notched bones dating as far back as 20 – 30 @,@ 000 years ago , are believed by some to mark the phases of the Moon . The ~ 30 @-@ day month is an approximation of the lunar cycle . The English noun month and its cognates in other Germanic languages stem from Proto @-@ Germanic * <unk> , which is connected to the above @-@ mentioned Proto @-@ Germanic * <unk> , indicating the usage of a lunar calendar among the Germanic peoples ( Germanic calendar ) prior to the adoption of a solar calendar . The PIE root of moon , * <unk> , derives from the PIE verbal root * <unk> , " to measure " , " <unk> [ ing ] a functional conception of the moon , i.e. marker of the month " ( cf. the English words measure and menstrual ) , and echoing the Moon 's importance to many ancient cultures in measuring time ( see Latin <unk> and Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) or <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " month " ) . 
 The Moon has been the subject of many works of art and literature and the inspiration for countless others . It is a motif in the visual arts , the performing arts , poetry , prose and music . A 5 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old rock carving at <unk> , Ireland , may represent the Moon , which would be the earliest depiction discovered . The contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as the Man in the Moon , the rabbit and the buffalo , among others . In many prehistoric and ancient cultures , the Moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon , and astrological views of the Moon continue to be propagated today . 
 The Moon plays an important role in Islam ; the Islamic calendar is strictly lunar , and in many Muslim countries the months are determined by the visual sighting of the <unk> , or earliest crescent moon , over the horizon . The splitting of the moon ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> ) was a miracle attributed to Muhammad . 
 The Moon has long been associated with insanity and irrationality ; the words lunacy and lunatic ( popular shortening loony ) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon , Luna . Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals , believing that the brain , which is mostly water , must be affected by the Moon and its power over the tides , but the Moon 's gravity is too slight to affect any single person . Even today , people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals , traffic accidents , homicides or suicides increase during a full moon , but dozens of studies invalidate these claims .

 The Croatian National Guard ( Croatian : Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) was an armed force established by Croatia in April and May 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence . Although it was established within the framework of the Ministry of the Interior for legal reasons , the ZNG was under the direct command of the Ministry of Defence . It was tasked with the protection of Croatia 's borders and territory , and with tasks normally associated with police forces . The ZNG was formed with the transfer of special police units to the ZNG , establishing four all @-@ professional brigades in May 1991 , and was presented to the public in a military parade in Zagreb on 28 May . It was commanded by Defence Minister General Martin Špegelj before his resignation in early August . Špegelj was replaced by General Anton Tus , who became the first head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia ( established on 21 September ) . 
 During its development the ZNG experienced a number of problems , including shortages of weapons and ammunition , lack of uniforms , inadequate training and an overall deficiency in trained officers , and poor staff work and command structures ( preventing the effective coordination of multiple units ) . These problems were offset by good morale , clear objectives and high levels of mobilisation . After the Battle of the Barracks , the ZNG expanded significantly with arms captured from the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ) . By the end of October 60 new brigades and independent battalions were established , and on 3 November the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska ) .

 In 1990 , after the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia by the Croatian Democratic Union ( Croatian : Hrvatska demokratska zajednica , HDZ ) , ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslavenska narodna armija – JNA ) believed that Croatia would use the Croatian Territorial Defence Force 's ( Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) equipment to build its own army and confront the JNA . To minimize the expected resistance , the JNA confiscated the TO 's weapons . On 17 August tensions escalated into an open revolt by the Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near the southern town of Knin , parts of the Lika , Kordun and Banovina regions and eastern Croatia . They established a Serbian National Council in July 1990 to coordinate opposition to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman 's policy of pursuing independence for Croatia . Milan Babić , a dentist from Knin , was elected president and Knin police chief Milan Martić established paramilitary militias . The two men eventually became the political and military leaders of the SAO Krajina , a self @-@ declared state incorporating the Serb @-@ inhabited areas of Croatia . 
 The JNA learned about Croatia 's intention to develop its own military force from JNA Captain Vladimir Jager , a double agent employed by Croatia and the JNA Counterintelligence Service ( KOS ) . The JNA devised Operation Shield ( <unk> ) , aimed at disarming the Croatian forces and the arrest and trial of the Croatian leadership , in response . Although the operation was prepared by December 1990 , federal Defence Minister General Veljko Kadijević never sought authorisation to carry it out from the Yugoslav Presidency . Instead , he ordered the KOS to stand down on the morning the operation was scheduled to begin . 
 At the beginning of 1991 Croatia had no regular army , and to bolster its defence Croatia doubled the size of its police force to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the force was the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police , deployed in a military organisation of 12 battalions ; in addition , there were 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally @-@ organised reserve police officers . Although the reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies , they lacked weapons ( which were needed to arm the troops ) .

 Preparations for the ZNG began on 12 April 1991 . Its formation as a police force with military capability was considered necessary by Croatian authorities after March clashes in Pakrac and at Plitvice Lakes and the possibility of further confrontation with the JNA . Since it was illegal to establish a separate military in a constituent republic of Yugoslavia , the ZNG was planned as part of the police force under the Ministry of the Interior . Parliament amended the Internal Affairs Act on 18 April , and the ZNG was formally established five days later . It was tasked with the protection of the constitutional order , the maintenance of public order , anti @-@ terrorist operations , the protection of Croatia 's borders , territory , coast and territorial waters , valuable structures and high @-@ profile individuals . Although the ZNG was formally subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior , its founding legislation stipulated that it would be commanded by the Ministry of Defence . 
 On 5 May the number of ZNG troops and their composition was determined , followed by operational guidelines issued by Defence and Interior Ministers Martin Špegelj and Josip Boljkovac for the transfer of police personnel to the ZNG on 10 May . By 15 May several special police units ( <unk> ) transferred to the ZNG , forming four brigades . By July the ZNG had approximately 8 @,@ 000 troops and , unlike other Croatian forces , were fully equipped with small arms . The reserve police force , numbering about 39 @,@ 000 in April , was also transferred to reserve ZNG brigades and independent battalions . On 18 May the Zrinski Battalion was established as a special forces unit of the ZNG , its core consisting of 27 volunteers drawn from the Kumrovec SPU . Initially , it also relied on former French Foreign Legion troops . By July , the reserve force of 40 @,@ 000 ZNG troops was assigned to 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions ; however , they did not possess sufficient heavy or small arms for all their personnel . The Croatian police had approximately 15 @,@ 000 small arms , with less than 30 @,@ 000 additional weapons obtained from abroad by August . 
 On 28 May , the ZNG was presented to the public in a military parade at the Kranjčevićeva Street Stadium to boost morale . The parade featured approximately 800 soldiers , a dozen anti @-@ aircraft systems , armoured cars and several armoured personnel carriers ; the Presidential Guards and <unk> also participated . 
 = = = Development problems = = = 
 To command individual units , regional ZNG commands were established in eastern Slavonia , the Banovina – Kordun area , Lika , central and northern Dalmatia , southern Dalmatia and Zagreb in late July and August . Crisis headquarters , which also had command authority of ZNG units , were established down to the municipal level . The command structure was particularly poor , preventing effective coordination between units . Although the many crisis headquarters were entrusted with a high level of authority , they consisted of politicians with little ( if any ) military training other than JNA service . Multiple units deployed to a single area often had no authority coordinating their activities . TO command systems were reactivated in some places ( such as Zagreb ) , somewhat improving the situation . 
 Other problems faced by the ZNG included a shortage of trained officers , inadequate troop training , a shortage of weapons and especially a shortage of ammunition . Mobilisation proved particularly successful , however , and troops were plentiful ; in Zagreb , approximately 80 percent of those called up in September and October reported for service . The ZNG were short of uniforms ; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms , while the remainder fought in civilian clothes . The ZNG also relied on the civilian infrastructure for food , fuel and medical care . 
 Špegelj was replaced by Šime Đodan as Defence Minister in July . He remained in command of the ZNG until 3 August , when he resigned over Tuđman 's refusal to authorise attacks against JNA barracks . After Špegelj 's resignation , command of the ZNG was entrusted to General Anton Tus . 
 = = = Transition to the Croatian Army = = = 
 In mid @-@ September the regional commands were replaced by six operational zones , headquartered in Osijek , Bjelovar , Zagreb , Karlovac , Rijeka and Split . The zones possessed uneven strength ; those in Slavonia and Dalmatia were heavily equipped , and the Zagreb zone had twice the average troop strength . After capturing a stockpile of weapons during the Battle of the Barracks , the ZNG expanded to 60 reserve brigades and independent battalions by the end of October ( in addition to the four all @-@ professional guards brigades ) . Although each brigade was planned to have 1 @,@ 800 troops , in reality their size varied from 500 to 2 @,@ 500 . Three named special @-@ forces battalions were also established within the ZNG ( in addition to the Zrinski Battalion ) : the Frankopan , <unk> Tomislav and Matija <unk> Battalions . 
 On 20 September Parliament enacted the Defence Act , specifying that the ZNG and the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) comprised the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia . At the same time , the armed forces were formally subordinated to the Ministry of Defence rather than the Ministry of the Interior . The legislation also designated the TO reserve units as a constituent part of the ZNG reserve force . The following day the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia was established , headed by Tus . On 8 October ( the day Croatia declared its independence ) the Defence Act was amended , with the ZNG redefined as a part of the HV . ZNG reserve units became the HV reserve , named the Home Guard ( <unk> ) , leaving the ZNG an all @-@ professional force . The ZNG was renamed the HV on 3 November 1991 . 
 = = = Service = = = 
 ZNG units participated is a number of significant battles in the early part of the war , attempting to hold back Yugoslav forces . These include the battles of Gospić , Šibenik and Zadar , where the ZNG defended cities in Lika and along the Dalmatian coast against the JNA and its allies . The ZNG also took part in the battles of Vukovar and Osijek in eastern Slavonia , defended Dubrovnik and contributed to the capture of the JNA barracks and Operation Hurricane @-@ 91 ( an attempt to push the JNA out of western Slavonia .

 The HV continued to grow , numbering about 200 @,@ 000 troops by the end of 1991 . Although the force successfully countered the JNA that year , the HV was deficient in organisation , training and heavy @-@ weapons support . By the end of 1991 , the HV still lacked sufficient resources to push back the JNA and continued experiencing inadequate work by their staff . Nonetheless , like the ZNG it benefited from its troops ' high morale and the well @-@ defined purpose of its mission . The growth and systematic improvement of HV capability accelerated in 1992 , continuing throughout the Croatian War of Independence . The anniversary of the ZNG parade at the Kranjčevićeva Street Stadium is celebrated annually in Croatia as Armed Forces Day and Croatian Army Day . 
 = Marasmius rotula = 
 Marasmius rotula is a common species of agaric fungus in the family Marasmiaceae . Widespread in the Northern Hemisphere , it is commonly known variously as the pinwheel mushroom , the pinwheel <unk> , the little wheel , the collared parachute , or the horse hair fungus . The type species of the genus Marasmius , M. rotula was first described scientifically in 1772 by mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli and assigned its current name in 1838 by Elias Fries . 
 The fruit bodies , or mushrooms , of M. rotula are characterized by their whitish , thin , and membranous caps up to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) wide that are sunken in the center , and pleated with scalloped margins . The slender and wiry black hollow stems measure up to 8 @.@ 0 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) long by 1 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 06 in ) thick . On the underside of the caps are widely spaced white gills that are attached to a collar encircling the stem . The mushrooms grow in groups or clusters on decaying wood such as fallen twigs and sticks , moss @-@ covered logs , and stumps . 
 Unlike other mushrooms known to release spores in response to a circadian rhythm , spore release in M. rotula is dependent upon sufficient moisture . Dried mushrooms may revive after rehydrating and continue to release spores for up to three weeks — a sustained spore production of markedly longer duration than other typical agarics . There are several species of Marasmius with which M. rotula might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances , but differences in size , gill arrangement , and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish them . Although M. rotula mushrooms are not generally considered edible , they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is attracting research interest for possible use in bioengineering applications . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described by Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli as Agaricus rotula in 1772 . In 1821 Elias Magnus Fries redescribed the mushroom in Systema Mycologicum , and later transferred it to Marasmius in his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici . Synonyms include names derived from generic transfers to <unk> by Narcisse Théophile Patouillard in 1887 , and to Chamaeceras by Otto Kuntze in 1898 ; both of these genera are now obsolete and have since been sunk back into Marasmius . 
 In his 1821 A Natural Arrangement of British Plants , Samuel Frederick Gray introduced the generic name Micromphale , including the species Micromphale <unk> , which was based on William Withering 's 1796 Merulius <unk> . In 1946 Alexander H. Smith and Rolf Singer proposed to conserve the name Marasmius over Micromphale ; the latter had nomenclatorial priority as it was published first . The generic name Marasmius , with M. rotula as the lectotype species , was later conserved at the 1954 Paris Congress on Botanical Nomenclature . M. rotula is also the type species of section Marasmius within the genus . This grouping of species is characterized by inamyloid flesh , a cap cuticle with broom cells ( finger @-@ like projections common to Marasmius species ) ornamented with numerous warts , gills usually attached to a collar surrounding the stem , and the presence of black rhizomorphs on the stem . 
 Several varieties of M. rotula have been described . Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis named var. fuscus in 1869 for its brown cap . In 1887 Pier Andrea Saccardo described var. microcephalus from Italy , with caps half the normal size . It is now understood , however , that fruit body morphology is variable and dependent upon environmental conditions . Joseph Schröter described var. <unk> in 1889 , but that taxon is now treated as Marasmius <unk> . 
 Marasmius rotula is commonly known as the " pinwheel mushroom " , the " pinwheel Marasmius " , the " collared parachute " , or the " horse hair fungus " . This latter name is shared with other Marasmius species , including M. androsaceus and M. crinis @-@ equi . Gray called it the " collared dimple @-@ stool " . The name " little wheel fungus " is suggestive of the collar to which the gills are attached like the spokes of a wheel , like the specific epithet , which is a diminutive of rota , the Latin word for " wheel " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of the fruit body is thin and membranous , measuring 3 to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter . It has a convex shape slightly depressed in the center , conspicuous furrows in an outline of the gills , and scalloped edges . Young , unexpanded caps are yellowish brown ; as the cap expands , the color lightens to whitish or light pinkish @-@ white , often with a darker , sometimes brown center . The variety fusca has brown caps . The white or slightly yellowish flesh is very thin , reaching about 0 @.@ 25 – 1 @.@ 5 mm thick in the central part of the cap , and even thinner at the margin . 
 Gills are attached to a collar , never to the stem , although some specimens have the collar pressed close enough to it that this characteristic may be less obvious . Widely spaced , they have the same whitish to pale yellow color as the flesh , and typically number between 16 and 22 . They are initially narrow , but thicken downward to about 1 – 3 mm at the exposed edge . The stem is 1 @.@ 2 to 8 @.@ 0 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) long and up to 0 @.@ 15 cm ( 0 @.@ 06 in ) thick , with a smooth , sometimes shiny surface . It is tough , hollow , and either straight or with some curving . The color is blackish @-@ brown up to a lighter , almost translucent apex . The base of the stem may be connected to dark brown or black root @-@ like rhizomorphs 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 3 mm thick . Mature specimens display no veil . 
 Details of the fruit bodies ' appearance , color in particular , are somewhat variable and dependent on growing conditions . For example , specimens growing on logs in oak and hickory forests in the spring tend to have more yellowish @-@ white , depressed caps than those found in the same location in autumn , which are light yellow brown and more convex in shape . The fruit body development of M. rotula is <unk> , with an hymenium that is only partially enclosed by basidiocarp tissues . Robert Kühner showed that a cortina @-@ like tissue covers the young gills before the expanding cap breaks away from the stem . In unfavorable weather conditions , however , the mushrooms may fail to develop normally and instead produce semi @-@ gasteroid basidiocarps . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 Viewed in deposit , such as with a spore print , the spores of Marasmius rotula appear white or pale yellow . Under an optical microscope , they are hyaline ( translucent ) , <unk> or pip @-@ shaped , and have dimensions of 7 – 10 by 3 – 5 µm . The basidia ( spore @-@ producing cells ) are four @-@ spored , club @-@ shaped or nearly so , and 21 – 21 by 4 – 17 µm . Along the edge of the gill , interspersed among the basidia , are non @-@ reproductive cells , the cheilocystidia ; these are club @-@ shaped with rough wart @-@ like protuberances on the surface . The gill edges further feature broom cells , which are variably shaped , thin @-@ walled , and measure 7 – 32 by 2 @.@ 5 – 20 µm . Their apical surfaces are covered with yellowish , blunt , and conical warts or incrustations 0 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 5 by 0 @.@ 1 – 1 µm . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 There are several less @-@ common species of Marasmius with which M. rotula might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances , but differences in size , gill arrangement , and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish between them . For example , Marasmius capillaris has a pale tan cap with a white center , and grows on oak leaves without forming clusters . Furthermore , its cap is evenly rounded , unlike the pleated and furrowed cap of M. rotula , and its stem is somewhat thinner ( usually less than 0 @.@ 3 mm ) and slightly darker in color . 
 M. rotula is distinguished from M. <unk> by its larger size , and greater number of gills . M. limosus is found in marshes , where it fruits on the dead stems of reeds and rushes . <unk> nigripes ( formerly treated in Marasmius ) has white caps that are 5 to 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter , attached gills that are sometimes slightly decurrent , a dark stem covered with tiny white hairs that give it a powdered appearance , and triangular to star @-@ shaped spores . M. <unk> , described from Brazil , was considered by its discoverer Rolf Singer to be closely related to M. rotula . In addition to its tropical distribution , it can distinguished from M. rotula by its smaller size and more widely spaced gills . M. <unk> , known only from montane forests of Trinidad , can only be reliably distinguished from M. rotula by microscopic characteristics : it has smaller , ovoid spores measuring 5 by 2 @.@ 5 µm . 
 Other Marasmius species with a pinwheel arrangement of gills are readily distinguished from M. rotula by differences in color , including the orange M. siccus , the pink M. <unk> , and the rust M. <unk> . Mycena <unk> is smaller than Marasmius rotula , has a pale pink @-@ brown cap , and is usually found growing singly or in small groups on bark near the base of living trees . 
 = = Ecology and distribution = = 
 Marasmius rotula is a saprobic species and as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter . It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood ( especially beech ) , woody debris such as twigs or sticks , and occasionally on rotting leaves . The fruit bodies , which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size , are often present in abundance after rains . The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials , and will grow poorly or not at all under water stress conditions . It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water @-@ holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil . The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies ' stems . 
 In 1975 American mycologist Martina S. Gilliam investigated the periodicity of spore release in M. rotula and concluded that spore discharge did not follow a regular circadian rhythm , as is typical of agaric and bolete mushrooms , but rather was dependent on rain . A threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a spore discharge response and the duration of peak spore discharge correlates with the amount of rainfall , rather than its duration . Furthermore , Gilliam noted that spore prints were more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed in water , suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur . 
 Like those of many other species of Marasmius , the fruit bodies of M. rotula can desiccate and shrivel in dry periods , then revive when sufficient moisture is available again in the form of rain or high humidity . Gilliam 's study demonstrated that revived fruit bodies were capable of discharging spores over a period of at least three weeks , whereas previous studies using similar methods with other Agaricomycetes showed spore discharge occurred over a shorter period of up to six days after revival . The potential for sustained spore production and discharge may be due to the growth of new basidioles ( immature basidia ) during periods of growth , which then complete maturation when the mushroom revives . This may also explain why the gills become thicker as the mushroom matures . 
 The fungus is widespread and common in its preferred habitats in North America , Europe , and northern Asia . Although far less common in southerly locations , isolated collections have been reported from Africa ( Congo , Nigeria , Sierra Leone , and Tanzania ) and South Asia ( India ) . In North America M. rotula is most common in the eastern part of the continent . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Marasmius rotula is generally considered inedible , but not poisonous . The mushroom has no distinguishable odor , and its taste is mild or bitter . Louis Krieger , writing in National Geographic in the 1920s , noted that the mushroom was used as an addition to <unk> and , when used to garnish venison , " adds the appropriate touch of the wild woodlands . " The fruit bodies will bioaccumulate cadmium : a study of the metal concentration of 15 wild mushroom species of India showed that M. rotula accumulated the highest concentration of that metal . 
 A peroxidase enzyme known as <unk> ( Marasmius rotula aromatic <unk> ) is attracting research interest for possible applications in <unk> . In general , enzymes that catalyze oxygen @-@ transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions . Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations that are difficult for the organic chemist , including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline , 4 @-@ <unk> , hydroquinone , <unk> , catechol , and paracetamol . The M. rotula enzyme is the first fungal <unk> that can be produced in high yields . It is highly stable over a wide pH range , and in a variety of organic solvents . The enzyme has other potential for use as a <unk> for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring .

 What is now DE 1A was originally a part of DE 14 between 1936 and 1942 . The road was designated DE 14A by 1966 . In the 1970s , DE 1A was designated along DE 14A for a few years before DE 14A was decommissioned in favor of DE 1A .

The road passes through residential areas before it curves northwest and runs to the south of Silver Lake . The route bends north and crosses the lake , where it enters Rehoboth Beach . Here , the name changes to Bayard Avenue and it becomes a divided highway . DE 1A becomes undivided again and comes to an intersection with Christian Street . At this point , northbound DE 1A turns northwest onto Christian Street to reach Rehoboth Avenue while southbound DE 1A follows 2nd Street north to Rehoboth Avenue . 
 The highway heads west along four @-@ lane divided Rehoboth Avenue and passes businesses . The road intersects DE 1B before it comes to a roundabout at Grove Street / Columbia Avenue . Following this , the route narrows into a two @-@ lane undivided road and crosses the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal on a drawbridge , leaving Rehoboth Beach . DE 1A continues west past homes and businesses and ends at another intersection with DE 1 . 
 DE 1A has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 21 @,@ 215 vehicles just west of Rehoboth Beach to a low of 3 @,@ 076 vehicles on the service road at the northern terminus at DE 1 . None of DE 1A is part of the National Highway System .

The DE 14A designation was dropped in 1977 and the road was solely designated DE 1A . 
 In October 2002 , work began on a streetscape project to revitalize Rehoboth Avenue . The project provided new sidewalks and plants and placed utility lines underground . A roundabout opened at Grove Street and Columbia Avenue in May 2004 . The roundabout features a replica of the Cape Henlopen Light and serves as a gateway to Rehoboth Beach . When the roundabout first opened , there were issues of drivers not yielding properly . As a result , improved yield signage was installed .

Har Mar Mall comprises over 430 @,@ 000 square feet ( 40 @,@ 000 m2 ) of retail space and is anchored by Burlington Coat Factory , Cub Foods , <unk> , and Marshalls . The mall contains 45 tenants , including several national chains , such as Barnes & Noble , David 's Bridal , and Staples Inc . 
 Opened in 1963 and expanded several times since , it is one of two enclosed malls in Roseville ; the other mall being Rosedale Center . Despite being a relatively small shopping center , Har Mar Mall continues to remain open . It was constructed by Robert W. Fendler of Fendler Patterson and is currently owned and managed by the <unk> Group and <unk> Services , respectively .

 Construction for the Har Mar Mall began in 1961 , when Harold J. Slawik had a vision to build a " super mall " , similar to shopping centers he had seen while traveling in Florida . Deriving its name from its owners – Harold J. Slawik and his wife Marie – Har Mar is a combination of the two names . It was built upon 50 acres of land near a busy intersection in Roseville , Minnesota . Minnesota @-@ native Willard Thorson , who designed Apache Plaza in nearby St. Anthony , designed the mall , while Robert W. Fendler served as the mall 's architect . According to Thorson , the mall consists of " a long corridor , which zigzags at a series of angles ... that make Har Mar truly unique " ; it features " massively wide " hallways and " arched ceilings with large windows " to allow natural light to enter the corridors . 
 The mall cost nearly $ 6 million to construct over a span of two years . During the summer of 1962 , Harold Slawik died , leaving his wife in charge of the mall 's construction ; Mrs. Slawik reportedly worked 80 hour weeks in order to keep up with the mall . In May of the same year , Target Corporation constructed their first location in a parking lot directly north of Har Mar. While nearby Rosedale Center was constructed in 1969 , Har Mar went through a significant expansion in the early 1970s . In 1970 , the construction of a twin theater , Har Mar 1 & 2 , was completed and became the Twin Cities ' second double @-@ screened cinema ; its luxurious design included a " spacious lobby , with three Venetian glass chandeliers and bubbling fountains " and was constructed by architect Benjamin Gingold Jr ..

 On June 14 , 1981 , Har Mar Mall was damaged by a large tornado during the afternoon hours . While the mall wasn 't heavily damaged and only affected the mall 's cosmetic appearance , several nearby local businesses and residences were left in ruins following the impact . Shortly after the tornado , a large renovation occurred to update the mall 's appearance and fix any damage left by it . In 1988 , another expansion took place , allowing Har Mar to acquire several larger retailers in the newly constructed space ; the opening of Highland Superstore and TJ Maxx appeared later this year , along with the addition of a new food court with seating for over 400 people . Three years later , the Highland Superstore was converted to <unk> , a regional office supply store . <unk> was later acquired by OfficeMax in 1992 before ultimately closing in 1995 ; <unk> opened in the space vacated by OfficeMax , and is currently leased by <unk> , the successor of <unk> . In the 2000s , Har Mar underwent a cosmetic makeover that cost previous owner <unk> Realty Services nearly $ 12 million ; <unk> sparked interest in opening a Von Maur at the center , but the proposal eventually dissolved . 
 In 2014 , Burlington Coat Factory , a discount apparel retailer , announced that they planned to lease a 52 @,@ 300 square feet ( 4 @,@ 900 m2 ) space previously occupied by Northwestern Books ; the opening of this location allowed all of Har Mar 's anchor tenants to be completely leased . Currently , the mall still prospers mixing " large , special interest stores , as well as a variety of smaller , more unique stores " under one roof . Several new tenants and businesses have began leasing space in the center , such as Staples Inc . , D 'Amico & Sons , plus several other fine dining establishments . In November 2015 , a plan was proposed by the City of Roseville for the expansion of transportation routes in the neighboring vicinity of Har Mar ; the director of the project , Paul Bilotta , stated that the project could bring new customers to the mall which Bilotta states has " struggled for identity for a number of decades " . According to Mass Transit , construction of the project will begin in mid 2016 .

Baby One More Time ( 1999 ) and visited United States and Canada . The tour was announced in March 1999 , with dates released a month later . Tommy Hilfiger was chosen as the tour sponsor . The show was divided into various segments , with each segment being followed by an interlude to the next segment , and it ended with an encore . The setlist consisted of songs from her debut album and several covers . The tour received positive feedback from critics ; many highlighted Spears ' persona and edgy look .

 On March 5 , 1999 , it was reported that Spears was planning her first headlining tour to support her first studio album , ... Baby One More Time ( 1999 ) . Shortly after , she announced that the tour would start in July . On May 12 , 1999 , Tommy Hilfiger was announced as the main tour sponsor . During the time of the announcement , Spears was being featured in the " <unk> " campaign launched by the company . Hilfiger spoke about the sponsorship saying , 
 " My passion for music has always inspired my designs . This year we have really put music in the forefront of everything we do . Britney represents the spirit of Tommy Jeans and of youth today . I cannot think of a better way to continue this exciting year by sponsoring one of today 's hottest , young recording artists " . 
 The secondary sponsor was supposed to be Nestlé , but they pulled out soon after provocative photographs of Spears shot by David LaChapelle were published in Rolling Stone . Tour dates were released through Pollstar on April 9 , 1999 , with the tour kicking off on June 28 , 1999 , in Pompano Beach , Florida . Several dates were added and rescheduled , and the complete schedule was released two months later . 
 Spears talked to CNN about her involvement during the development of the tour , stating that she had designed the entire tour herself , including costumes and concept . Spears worked with fashion designer Gia <unk> to create the costumes for her and the dancers . The proscenium stage was simple and had only one main prop , a staircase in the middle . The band was in both sides of the staircase and consisted of five musicians . There were also six dancers , that took the stage during interludes . The setlist consisted of eight songs from her debut album and several covers by well @-@ known artists .

 The show began with a dance introduction by Spears ' dancers among smoke effects . She appeared shortly after at the top of the staircase wearing a hot pink vinyl tube top and white vinyl pants with pink knee patches , to perform " ( You Drive Me ) Crazy " . In " Soda Pop " she danced and interacted with the audience , before leaving the stage while her dancers continued . She appeared sitting on the staircase to sing " Born to Make You Happy " and " From the Bottom of My Broken Heart " . The show continued with a dance interlude set to Madonna 's " Vogue " in which she named Madonna and Janet Jackson as her biggest inspirations . She then took the stage to perform a cover of Madonna 's " Material Girl " . After this , she performed two covers of Janet Jackson songs , " Black Cat " and " Nasty " . She ended the section with a performance of Sonny & Cher 's " The Beat Goes On " , accompanied by psychedelic lights .

 The tour garnered generally positive reviews from critics . Jeffrey Haney of the Deseret News described the show as " funky and flashy " . A reporter from USA Today called Spears ' performance " assured and energetic " . Jim Farber of the New York Daily News pointed out that Spears seemed to have two personas during the show , one when singing songs from her album and a more edgy look when singing the covers . He also added that " Spears ' nods to edginess no doubt reflects her desire to grow into a more mature career " . Jane <unk> of the San Francisco Chronicle said that " she may be somewhat entertaining , but she 's also just another prefab act – longer on packaging than actual talent " .

 = San Marino national football team = 
 The San Marino national football team ( Italian : Nazionale di <unk> di San Marino ) is the national football team of San Marino , controlled by the San Marino Football Federation ( <unk> ) . The team represents the second smallest population , of any UEFA member . 
 The first official game played by a San Marino team was a 4 – 0 defeat in a European Championships qualifier by Switzerland in 1990 . Previously , a San Marino side had lost 1 – 0 to a Canadian Olympic team in 1986 , but this was not an official match . Since making their competitive bow , San Marino have competed in qualifying for every European Championships and World Cup , but have never won a match in either competition . They have only ever won one game , beating Liechtenstein 1 – 0 in a friendly match on 28 April 2004 . 
 Until November 2014 San Marino were tied in last place in the FIFA World Rankings , a run that lasted since the rankings were given a new calculation methodology . They were tied for last with Bhutan , ( 208th ) in the October 2014 rankings , a 0 – 0 draw with Estonia during the Euro 2016 qualifying rounds ensured their departure from the foot of the rankings . The national side made their first away goal in fourteen years against another Baltic side , Lithuania during the same qualifying rounds . 
 = = History = = 
 Though the San Marino Football Federation formed in 1931 , the federation did not establish a national team until 1986 , when a team representing the Federation played Canada 's Olympic team in an unofficial international . San Marino gained affiliation to governing bodies FIFA and UEFA in 1988 , allowing the team to participate in major championships . Prior to this , Sammarinese players had been considered Italian in international football contexts . 
 San Marino 's first match in a FIFA sanctioned competition was against Switzerland on 14 November 1990 in a qualifier for the 1992 European Championships . San Marino lost 4 – 0 , and went to lose all eight qualifiers . The team particularly struggled in away matches , losing every one by at least four goals . San Marino scored only one goal , a penalty in a 3 – 1 defeat at home by Romania , and conceded 33 goals in total . 
 For their first World Cup qualifying campaign , San Marino were drawn in a group with England , the Netherlands , Norway , Poland and Turkey . The opening match resulted in a 10 – 0 hammering at the hands of Norway . The return match was less one @-@ sided , finishing 2 – 0 to the Norwegians . A 4 – 1 defeat in Turkey saw San Marino score their first World Cup goal , and a 0 – 0 draw against the same opposition on 10 March 1993 gave them their first ever point . In their final qualifier , against England , Davide Gualtieri scored the fastest goal in World Cup Qualifying history — after 8 @.@ 3 seconds — though the team went on to lose 7 – 1 . San Marino finished the campaign with one point , and conceded 46 goals in 10 matches . 
 The team 's qualification campaign for Euro 1996 followed a similar pattern to that of the previous European championships , as they lost every game . A match away to Finland gave San Marino their first goal away from home in the European championships , but the team lost 4 – 1 . Their only other goal came in a 3 – 1 home defeat by the Faroe Islands ; the two wins over San Marino were the only points gained by the Faroe Islands in the group . In the return match , a 3 – 0 scoreline in <unk> , is the Faroe Islands record competitive win . 
 Even by Sammarinese standards , qualification for the 1998 World Cup was disappointing . Losing every game by three goals or more , San Marino failed to score a single goal . This is the only World Cup qualifying tournament in which they have failed to score . Qualification for Euro 2000 again resulted in defeats in every game . The closest game was against Cyprus , a 1 – 0 defeat on 18 November 1998 . 
 In April 2001 , San Marino gained their first ever away point , drawing 1 – 1 with Latvia in Riga . The team ended the 2002 World Cup qualifying group with a new best of three goals , though one of these came in a 10 – 1 defeat by Belgium . In Euro 2004 qualifying San Marino lost all eight matches , failing to score . The closest result was a 1 – 0 home defeat by Latvia , with the winner scored in the last minute . 
 In April 2004 , San Marino gained their first , and as of September 2012 only , win in their 65th attempt , a 1 – 0 victory over Liechtenstein in a friendly on 28 April 2004 courtesy of a fifth @-@ minute goal by Andy Selva . The match was Martin Andermatt 's debut as Liechtenstein manager . Results during qualification for the 2006 World Cup followed a similar vein to previous qualifying groups . Matches were generally one @-@ sided defeats , with the exception of single goal defeats at home by Lithuania and Belgium . 
 San Marino 's opening Euro 2008 qualifying match resulted in a record 13 – 0 defeat at home by Germany on 6 September 2006 . They scored only twice and conceded fifty @-@ seven goals in losing all twelve matches , although the home matches against Ireland , Cyprus and Wales were each lost by a single goal . 
 In the qualification tournament for the 2010 World Cup , they lost all ten matches played and failed to qualify . They conceded 47 goals in those fixtures , including 10 in a defeat by Poland , which became Poland 's highest scoring victory of all time , and scored just once , in a 3 – 1 defeat by Slovakia . Qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012 started in a similar way , the first nine matches all being defeats with an aggregate of 49 goals conceded and none scored , their best result being a one @-@ goal loss to Finland at home , with the worst being a heavy 11 – 0 loss to the Netherlands , which became the Netherlands ' highest scoring victory of all time and San Marino 's worst @-@ ever away defeat . This was then followed up by two lighter defeats , a 5 – 0 home loss against Sweden , before completing the campaign with a 4 – 0 away loss to Moldova . 
 On 10 September 2013 , Alessandro Della Valle scored San Marino 's first competitive goal for 5 years . With the score 0 – 1 to Poland in the Serravalle stadium , he headed in a free @-@ kick in the 22nd minute , beating A.F.C. Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur <unk> at his front post . Poland then regained the lead a minute later , winning 5 – 1 . It was the first international goal of any kind scored by San Marino since the national team lost 3 – 2 at home to Malta , the sole time the national team has scored more than once in any given international at senior level . 
 On 15 November 2014 , San Marino drew 0 – 0 at home against Estonia . It was the first time in 10 years that the team had not lost a game , ending a 61 – match losing streak , and securing the country 's first ever point in a European Championship qualifier . 
 = = Stadium = = 
 San Marino play home matches at the Stadio Olimpico , a municipally owned stadium in Serravalle which also hosts the matches of club side San Marino Calcio . It has a capacity of 7 @,@ 000 . Crowds are low , and on occasion travelling supporters outnumber the Sammarinese support . For example , in the fixture against the Republic of Ireland in February 2007 , 2 @,@ 500 of the 3 @,@ 294 crowd were Irish supporters . 
 San Marino have played two " home " matches outside their borders . For World Cup qualifiers against England and the Netherlands in 1993 the Stadio Renato Dall 'Ara in Bologna was used . 
 = = Reputation = = 
 San Marino once had the smallest population of any UEFA country , until the May 2013 election of Gibraltar . The republic has never won a competitive fixture and its poor record has led the country to gain a very low reputation in world football . A 2004 1 – 0 friendly win against Liechtenstein remains their sole victory to date . 
 The national side is mainly composed of amateur players . Only a small number of players are professionals , with many holding second jobs outside of the sport . Their 13 – 0 defeat at home by Germany is a European Championship record , and they have conceded ten goals on four other separate occasions . In media terms they are constantly referred to as the ' whipping boys ' , a remark regarding their emphatic number of goals conceded in each tournament entered . 
 In the FIFA World Rankings , San Marino traditionally have the lowest rank of any UEFA country . Since the creation of FIFA rankings in 1992 , San Marino 's average position has been 176th . 
 In 2001 , Latvia manager Gary Johnson resigned after failing to beat San Marino in a World Cup qualifier . The Republic of Ireland 's 2 – 1 win in February 2007 ( due to a last @-@ second goal ) resulted in scathing press criticism . 
 San Marino set a European record when they went over 20 games without scoring between October 2008 and August 2012 . On 8 September 2015 , San Marino scored its first away goal in 14 years when Matteo <unk> scored against Lithuania in Euro 2016 qualification .

 In January 2006 , the Sammarinese Football Association named Massimo Bonini as their greatest ever player . Three @-@ times Italian Serie A champion , he is the only Sammarinese player to have won an official international competition including the European Champions ' Cup and the Intercontinental Cup . Bonini represented Italy at under @-@ 21 level in the early 1980s , and he played for Juventus from 1981 to 1988 , but was prevented from gaining full honours due to a rule change . By the time San Marino became a full UEFA member , Bonini was in his thirties , but gained 19 caps between 1990 and 1995 . 
 After retiring from playing , Bonini became San Marino 's manager , succeeding Giorgio Leoni . He held the position until 1998 , when he was replaced by Giampaolo Mazza . As of 2012 , Mazza is the longest @-@ serving manager of any European national team . Though he gave up his position after their 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualification campaign , giving way to former u @-@ 21s boss <unk> <unk> . 
 The appearance record for San Marino is held by Andy Selva , whose 68 caps and he also is the record goalscorer with 8 goals . 
 San Marino 's player Davide Gualtieri scored the fastest goal ever in a Fifa match against England .

 = The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show = 
 " The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show " is the fourteenth episode of the eighth season of the animated television sitcom The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 9 , 1997 . In the episode , The Itchy & Scratchy Show attempts to regain viewers by introducing a hip new character named Poochie , whose voice is provided by Homer . The episode is largely self @-@ referential and satirizes the world of television production , fans of The Simpsons and the series itself . It was written by David X. Cohen , and directed by Steven Dean Moore . Alex Rocco is a credited guest voice as Roger Meyers , Jr. for the third and final time ( having previously provided the character 's voice in " Itchy & Scratchy & Marge " and " The Day the Violence Died " ) , and Phil Hartman guest stars as Troy McClure . Poochie would become a minor recurring character and Comic Book Guy 's catchphrase , " Worst episode ever , " is introduced in this episode . With " The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show " , the show 's 167th , The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones in the number of episodes produced for a prime @-@ time animated series . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The ratings of the Itchy & Scratchy Show segment of the Krusty the Clown Show suddenly fail . Krusty orders the cartoon 's producer , Roger Meyers , to find a way to fix the sagging ratings , or else a Chinese cartoon will replace Itchy and Scratchy . Meyers decides to commission a focus group to discover why Itchy and Scratchy has lost its popularity . 
 Bart and Lisa participate in the study , by watching cartoons and answering the questions . However , things do not go very well , with the children in the focus group contradicting themselves when explaining what they want ( they argue that Itchy and Scratchy should be both more realistic and more fantastical ) . Eventually , Lisa says that there was nothing wrong with Itchy and Scratchy in the first place ; rather , the characters had simply lost their novelty , and with it , the impact they once had on their audience . Meyers thanks Lisa for " saving " Itchy and Scratchy , and decides that his cartoon 's salvation lies in a new character . He tells Krusty and his team of writers that this new character should be a dog with " attitude " , who will be called Poochie . 
 Bart and Lisa suggest Homer to have a go at voice acting when they read that there will be open auditions . Homer auditions to read for Poochie 's voice , and gets the part . He and June Bellamy , his fellow voice actor , make several publicity stops to promote Poochie , where Homer confronts the show 's hardcore fans . Homer invites all of his friends and relatives to the screening of the first Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show . However , the cartoon is full of clichés and asinine antics , and by emphasizing Poochie , contains none of the show 's trademark violence . Everyone except Homer finds the episode unimpressive . Meyers is forced to admit that Poochie 's debut was a dud , and he decides to get rid of the character . 
 Homer learns that Poochie will be killed off , and resolves to keep Poochie alive . At his next recording session , rather than reading from the script , he implores the audience , through lines that he wrote , to give Poochie a fair chance . The writing team is uninterested with Homer 's statement , and he is led to believe that the comments will be in the next cartoon . So , Meyers dubs the line " I have to go now . My planet needs me . " into the dialogue , and the animation cel containing Poochie is yanked out of view . A statement attesting to the dog 's demise ( he died on the way back to his home planet ) is hurriedly edited into the cartoon ; the in @-@ studio audience cheers wildly as Krusty promises that Poochie is gone for good and signs a law preventing him from ever returning . Homer feels betrayed but , after realizing he never got paid for his efforts , attributes the affair to the nature of show business . 
 Throughout the episode , a man named Roy comes to live with the Simpsons . When Lisa remarks that new characters are just a desperate effort to boost shows with low ratings , Roy appears out of nowhere . He has a few minor lines and calls Homer " Mr. S. " 
 = = Production = = 
 " The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show " was written by David S. Cohen and directed by Steven Dean Moore . The episode was conceived as a commentary on what it was like to work on a television show that had long been on the air , but was considered to be nearing its end . This was intended to show that The Simpsons could still be good after eight seasons , even though it no longer had the " shock value " it did in the early years . Before production of season 8 began , several executives at Fox suggested the staff add a new character to the show , who would live with the Simpsons on a permanent basis , in a bid to freshen up the series . The writers found the suggestion , usually considered a sign of desperation to boost a flagging series , amusing , therefore much of the episode revolves around this trope . Parallel to the episode 's main plot , where Poochie is introduced on The Itchy & Scratchy Show to boost its ratings , the writers inserted the one @-@ time character Roy , a college @-@ aged man who is shown to be living with the Simpsons , with no explanation as to his character or presence , as a reference to the executives ' proposal . Roy was originally conceived for the " Time and Punishment " segment of the season six episode " Treehouse of Horror V " , living with the Simpsons in one of the alternate realities , as a second , teenage son in the family . 
 Cohen 's initial vision for Poochie was that he would be annoying to fans because he was wealthy , aloof and unlikeable . In the episode 's DVD commentary he read his script for the first cartoon featuring Itchy , Scratchy , and Poochie : 
 As with other episodes centering on the production of The Itchy & Scratchy Show , such as " The Front " , the show 's staff are shown . Almost all of them are based on the actual staff of The Simpsons . In the first scene at the production table the person in the lower right corner , wearing a squid T @-@ shirt , is Cohen . On the left side , the furthest away is Bill Oakley with Josh Weinstein next to him . Next to Weinstein is George Meyer , who is the writer who speaks out and gets fired . The animator shown designing Poochie is supervising director David Silverman . As Silverman plays the tuba , one was drawn into the background of the scene . Other writers who appear include Dan McGrath , Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , Donick Cary , Ron Hauge , Ned Goldreyer , and Mike Scully , who had to be added in later , as the animators " didn 't have his photo " from which to get an accurate likeness . 
 This episode also features the first mention of Comic Book Guy 's soon @-@ to @-@ be catchphrase " Worst . Episode . Ever . " , which was taken from the alt.tv.simpsons newsgroup . 
 = = Themes = = 
 This episode saw The Simpsons surpass The Flintstones for the number of episodes produced for an animated series . The episode therefore deals with the issue of longevity and the problems that arise when the producers try to make a show “ fresh ” again . 
 The show mainly deals with themes commonly known as " jumping the shark " , instances that usually occur when a failing show adds a new character or twist to boost ratings . The first theme is a commentary on adding a new character , when the show has run for too long . Usually , this is a technique used in shows that involve children , who have grown up . This was the case in " Oliver " in The Brady Bunch or " Luke " on Growing Pains . Both Poochie and Roy are used to reflect this , by attempting to keep The Itchy and Scratchy Show and the Simpson family fresh respectively . 
 Another theme is the notion of network executives forcing ideas onto a show . The interaction between the writers and the network executives in the episode underscore the differences between them . The writers understand the show 's inner workings , but the network executives approach improvements to the show from a business point of view . They try to incorporate what they see as a rebellious character with the comment " This is popular with the kids " , but the viewers later reject the character . The writers themselves are satirized in the episode , and are depicted as lazy and pretentious with few original ideas . 
 The last theme is the viewer backlash and obsession with internal consistency . When Comic Book Guy sees the Poochie episode , he immediately goes on the Internet and writes " Worst episode ever " on a message board ; a commentary on how the active audience nit picks the episode . The writers respond by using the voice of Bart : 
 Bart : Hey , I know it wasn 't great , but what right do you have to complain ? 
 Comic Book Guy : As a loyal viewer , I feel they owe me . 
 Bart : What ? They 're giving you thousands of hours of entertainment for free . What could they possibly owe you ? I mean , if anything , you owe them ! 
 Comic Book Guy : ... Worst episode ever . 
 Earlier in the episode Homer and June Bellamy attend an in @-@ store appearance as part of the promotion for the new character Poochie . They are asked a question of internal consistency , like the show 's fans do all the time ; Homer says to the fan who asks the question , " Why would a man whose shirt says ' Genius at Work ' spend all his time watching a children 's cartoon show ? " This is again a reflection on how the writers feel about the fans obsessing about internal consistency . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The original opening couch gag shows a pastiche of the cover collage from The Beatles ' 1967 album Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , which was first used earlier in the season in " Bart After Dark " . Otherwise , the episode refers to other TV shows , including the syndicated couch gag featuring the Flintstone family , recycled from the season 4 episode " Kamp Krusty " , to mark The Simpsons surpassing The Flintstones as the longest @-@ running animated series . Roy calls Homer and Marge Mr. and Mrs. S , which echoes Fonzie calling the Cunninghams " Mr. and Mrs. C " on Happy Days . Later , he decides to move in with " two sexy ladies " , recalling Jack Tripper in Three 's Company . Homer hiding in the closet to hear what the network executives were planning to do with Poochie is a reference to Jay Leno reportedly eavesdropping on a conversation between NBC executives on whether he or David Letterman would replace Johnny Carson as the host of The Tonight Show . 
 Itchy and Scratchy are based on Tom and Jerry and other cat @-@ and @-@ mouse cartoons . As a boy , series creator Matt Groening and his friends would fantasize about an ultra violent cartoon and how much fun it would be to work on a show like that . June Bellamy is a parody of voice actress June Foray . In the episode , Bellamy claims that she provided the " Beep , beep " sound effect in the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner cartoons ; in reality the phrase was voiced by Paul Julian .

 This episode was placed 23rd on Entertainment Weekly 's top 25 The Simpsons episodes list . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , praised " The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show " , calling it " a very neat episode which , like " The Front " , is a good parody of the cartooning business . " In 2007 , Vanity Fair named it the sixth @-@ best episode in the show 's history , describing it as " a classic satire of network influence , obsessed TV fans , and programs that survive long after the shark has been jumped , the episode is a meta @-@ celebration , a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek rebuttal to everyone who claimed that the quality of The Simpsons had declined over the years . " Todd Gilchrist called it a masterpiece , stating it " could easily be packaged and sold by [ itself ] . " Planet Simpson author Chris Turner describes the episode as " the most contentious and direct counterattack The Simpsons ever unleashed on its fans " and " [ harsh ] satire of the working world of big @-@ time TV production " . Robert Canning of IGN said it was " laugh @-@ out @-@ loud funny " and describing the introduction of Roy as " a hilarious parody of a classic , overused television device . " Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger , in a review printed two days after the episode originally aired , praised the writers for not airing a " very special " episode to celebrate the milestone of overtaking The Flintstones . He noted " [ the episode is ] so self @-@ aware it put the best in @-@ jokes on St. Elsewhere to shame . " The BBC named it as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show , noting " the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and rail against network interference in their show . " In 2014 , The Simpsons writers picked " The Beagle Has Landed " as one of their nine favorite " Itchy & Stratchy " episodes of all time . 
 In its original American broadcast , " The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show " finished tied for 38th place in the weekly ratings for the week of February 3 – 9 , 1997 with a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 8 . It was the third @-@ highest @-@ rated show on the Fox Network that week . 
 Comic Book Guy 's phrase " Worst . Episode . Ever " was named by The A.V. Club as a quote that could be used in everyday life , as well as being one of the most popular quotes from the show . 
 = SM UB @-@ 47 = 
 SM UB @-@ 47 was a Type UB II submarine or U @-@ boat for the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. UB @-@ 47 was sold to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( German : Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine or K.u.K. Kriegsmarine ) during the war . In Austro @-@ Hungarian service the B was dropped from her name and she was known as SM U @-@ 47 or U @-@ XLVII as a member of the Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ 43 class . 
 UB @-@ 47 was ordered in July 1915 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in September . UB @-@ 47 was a little more than 121 feet ( 37 m ) in length and displaced between 270 and 305 tonnes ( 266 and 300 long tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . She was equipped to carry a complement of four torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and had an 8 @.@ 8 @-@ centimeter ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) deck gun . As part of a group of six submarines selected for Mediterranean service , UB @-@ 47 was broken into railcar sized components and shipped to Pola where she was assembled and launched in June 1916 , and commissioned in July . Over the next year the U @-@ boat sank twenty ships , which included the French battleship Gaulois and two Cunard Line steamers in use as troopships , Franconia and Ivernia . 
 The German Imperial Navy was having difficulties in finding trained submarine crews and offered to sell UB @-@ 47 and a sister boat UB @-@ 43 to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . After the terms were agreed to in June 1917 , both boats were handed over at Pola . When commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , the B in her designation was dropped so that she became U @-@ 47 or U @-@ XLVII . She sank an additional three ships in Austro @-@ Hungarian service through the end of the war . U @-@ 47 was ceded to France as a war reparation in 1920 and broken at Bizerta that same year . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The German UB II design improved upon the design of the UB I boats , which had been ordered in September 1914 . In service , the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow . A major problem was that , because they had a single propeller shaft / engine combo , if either component failed , the U @-@ boat became almost totally disabled . To rectify this flaw , the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines ( one shaft for each engine ) , which also increased the U @-@ boat 's top speed . The new design also included more powerful batteries , larger torpedo tubes , and a deck gun . As a UB II boat , U @-@ 47 could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts , and nearly ten times as much fuel . To contain all of these changes the hull was larger , and the surface and submerged displacement was more than double that of the UB I boats . 
 The Imperial German Navy ordered UB @-@ 47 from AG Weser on 31 July 1915 as the final boat of a series of six UB II boats ( numbered from UB @-@ 42 to UB @-@ 47 ) , and the last UB II submarine numerically . UB @-@ 47 was 36 @.@ 90 metres ( 121 ft 1 in ) long and 4 @.@ 37 metres ( 14 ft 4 in ) abeam . She had a single hull with saddle tanks and had a draught of 3 @.@ 68 metres ( 12 ft 1 in ) when surfaced . She displaced 305 tonnes ( 300 long tons ) while submerged but only 272 tonnes ( 268 long tons ) on the surface . 
 The submarine was equipped with twin Daimler diesel engines and twin Siemens @-@ <unk> electric motors — for surfaced and submerged running , respectively . UB @-@ 47 had a surface speed of up to 8 @.@ 82 knots ( 16 @.@ 33 km / h ; 10 @.@ 15 mph ) and could go as fast as 6 @.@ 22 knots ( 11 @.@ 52 km / h ; 7 @.@ 16 mph ) while underwater . The U @-@ boat could carry up to 27 tonnes ( 27 long tons ) of diesel fuel , giving her a range of 6 @,@ 940 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 850 km ; 7 @,@ 990 mi ) at 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 5 @.@ 8 mph ) . Her electric motors and batteries provided a range of 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 mph ) while submerged . UB @-@ 47 was equipped with two 50 @-@ centimeter ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes . The U @-@ boat was also armed with one 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) Uk L / 30 deck gun . 
 UB @-@ 47 was laid down by AG Weser at its Bremen shipyard on 4 September 1915 . As one of six U @-@ boats selected for service in the Mediterranean while under construction , UB @-@ 47 was broken into railcar @-@ sized components and shipped overland to the Austro @-@ Hungarian port of Pola . Shipyard workers from Weser assembled the boat and her five sisters at Pola , where she was launched on 17 June . 
 = = German Imperial Navy career = = 
 SM UB @-@ 47 was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 4 July 1916 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Wolfgang Steinbauer . UB @-@ 47 , Steinbauer 's first U @-@ boat command , was assigned to the Navy 's Pola Flotilla ( German : Deutsche U @-@ Halbflotille Pola ) in which she remained throughout her German career . Although the flotilla was based in Pola , the site of the main Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy base , boats of the flotilla operated out of the Austro @-@ Hungarian base at Cattaro which was located farther south and closer to the Mediterranean . German U @-@ boats typically returned to Pola only for repairs . 
 On 17 August , Steinbauer and UB @-@ 47 achieved their first success when they sank the Italian steamer Stampalia south of Cape Matapan . Although Italy and Germany would not formally be at war for another ten days , German U @-@ boats in the Mediterranean routinely attacked Italian vessels by posing as Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines and flying the ensign of that country 's navy . Stampalia was an ocean liner of 9 @,@ 000 gross register tons ( GRT ) that had formerly been in passenger service between New York and Genoa , and had been one of the first Italian merchant vessels to be armed against submarine attacks . At the time of her sinking , she was in the service of the Italian government but was not carrying any passengers ; no casualties from Stampalia were reported in the attack . 
 Three weeks later , Steinbauer and UB @-@ 47 scored a triple kill , sinking three ships on the same day . The British steamer Butetown , en route from Malta to <unk> , was carrying coal and other cargo when she was sent down 55 nautical miles ( 102 km ; 63 mi ) west @-@ southwest of Cape Matapan on 8 September . UB @-@ 47 attacked <unk> , another British steamer , 7 nautical miles ( 13 km ; 8 @.@ 1 mi ) away , sending the ship and her cargo of Canadian oats headed to Salonica to the bottom . The third ship was the Greek ship <unk> , headed from Cyprus to Liverpool when sunk in the same vicinity . There were no casualties from any of the three ships ; the crews of Butetown and <unk> were rescued and landed at Marseilles on 16 September . 
 On 4 October , Steinbauer sank the largest ship of his career when UB @-@ 47 torpedoed the 1911 Cunard Line steamer Franconia at position 35 ° 56 ′ N 18 ° 30 ′ E , 195 nautical miles ( 361 km ; 224 mi ) east of Malta . The 625 @-@ foot ( 191 m ) long , 72 @-@ foot ( 22 m ) wide Franconia — nicknamed the " Bath Ship " in civilian days because of the number of passenger baths and showers — was , at 18 @,@ 510 GRT , the fifth largest ship sunk by a U @-@ boat during World War I. Franconia had been in service as a troopship since February 1915 but was not carrying troops at the time of the attack . The hospital ship Dover Castle picked up 302 survivors from Franconia ; 12 men were killed in the attack . 
 UB @-@ 47 's next success came a week later , on 11 October , when the 5 @,@ 002 @-@ ton British steamer <unk> was sunk west of Malta with the loss of four men . A German military announcement of 20 October proclaiming Steinbauer 's sinking of the ship reported that <unk> 's cargo included horses and Serbian grooms . The following day , <unk> , a British ship headed to Alexandria , was torpedoed southeast of Gozo . Although the German Admiralty reported her sunk , <unk> 's captain was able to ground his ship and prevent it from sinking . On 14 October , UB @-@ 47 sank five small Italian sailing vessels — ranging in size from 32 to 80 tons — near Syracuse , Sicily . The next day , UB @-@ 47 closed out the month of October with the sinking of the Greek steamer Avis . UB @-@ 47 's tally of sunken ships for the month of October came to 24 @,@ 776 gross register tons , which accounted for nearly 20 % of the total sunk by all German U @-@ boats in the Mediterranean . 
 On patrol in the Aegean Sea on 27 December , Steinbauer came across the French pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Gaulois . Although screened by light cruisers and naval trawlers , Steinbauer was , nonetheless , able to sink the 11 @,@ 100 @-@ ton displacement ship east of Cerigo . Two men were killed in the initial explosion and another two men died in the aftermath ; Gaulois 's normal complement was 631 men . Five days later , New Year 's Day 1917 , UB @-@ 47 torpedoed and sank the Cunard Line ship Ivernia — in service as a British troopship — at position 35 ° 30 ′ N 22 ° 53 ′ E , 58 nautical miles ( 107 km ; 67 mi ) from Cape Matapan . Under the command of Captain William T. Turner , who had been in command of Lusitania when that liner was sunk in May 1915 , the 14 @,@ 278 @-@ ton Ivernia was ferrying troops to Salonica when sunk by UB @-@ 47 . Because of the heavy weather at the time of Ivernia 's sinking , 120 officers and men and 33 crewmen were killed in the attack . Like Franconia , both Gaulois and Ivernia were among the largest ships sunk by U @-@ boats ; Ivernia was the 20th largest sunk . Two days after the attack on Ivernia , UB @-@ 47 torpedoed and damaged the British steamer <unk> , killing one person in the process . The 8 @,@ 818 GRT <unk> was the former North German Lloyd liner Lützow which had been captured by British naval forces in the Mediterranean in August 1914 , and , like UB @-@ 47 , had been built by AG Weser in Bremen . 
 On 1 March 1917 , UB @-@ 47 torpedoed and damaged the British steamer Euterpe near Suda Bay , killing two men in the process . A week later , on 8 March , Steinbauer sank his last ship at the helm of UB @-@ 47 , when Georgian was sent to the bottom 52 nautical miles ( 96 km ; 60 mi ) from Cape <unk> . The 1890 British ship , rated at 5 @,@ 088 gross register tons , was carrying government stores ; five of her crew perished in the attack . 
 On 1 April , Oberleutnant zur See Hans Hermann Wendlandt replaced Steinbauer as commanding officer of UB @-@ 47 . A week after assuming his first U @-@ boat command , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Wendlandt scored his first success by sinking two Greek steamers on the same day . <unk> was sailing in ballast from Salonica for New York when she was sunk northwest of Crete by an explosive charge placed by UB @-@ 47 's crew . Nestos was carrying a load of wheat from New York for Piraeus when shelled and sunk 50 nautical miles ( 93 km ; 58 mi ) from <unk> . Three days later , the British ship Cyfarthfa was torpedoed 32 nautical miles ( 59 km ; 37 mi ) from <unk> . The master of Cyfarthfa , which had been headed from Oran to Salonica , was taken prisoner by Wendlandt . 
 Wendlandt and UB @-@ 47 sank the Greek destroyer Doxa , a Niki @-@ class destroyer of 350 tonnes ( 340 long tons ) displacement , on 27 June . Although a part of the Royal Hellenic Navy , Doxa had been seized by the French in October 1916 and was operating as a French ship with an all @-@ French crew when torpedoed and sunk by UB @-@ 47 in the Straits of Messina ; 29 sailors died in the attack . Three days later , Wendlandt sank two Italian sailing ships of about 100 GRT each while east of Sicily . Five days later , UB @-@ 47 attacked the Japanese steamer <unk> Maru , from Karachi with a cargo of wheat for delivery to Italy . Wendlandt torpedoed the 1898 ship between Crete and Sicily . <unk> Maru was the last ship sunk by UB @-@ 47 in her German service . 
 On 21 July , UB @-@ 47 was decommissioned at Pola and handed over to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . In her German Imperial Navy career of just over a year , UB @-@ 47 sank twenty merchant ships totaling 76 @,@ 195 GRT , damaged three ships of 16 @,@ 967 GRT , and sank two warships with a combined displacement of 11 @,@ 450 tonnes ( 11 @,@ 270 long tons ) . 
 = = Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy service = = 
 In November 1916 , the German Imperial Navy , having a hard time finding trained submarine crews , inquired to find out if its ally Austria @-@ Hungary was interested in purchasing some of its Mediterranean submarines . A general agreement led to protracted negotiations , which stalled over the outflow of Austro @-@ Hungarian gold reserves to Germany . But , with all of the details worked out , the two parties agreed on the sale of UB @-@ 47 and sister ship UB @-@ 43 to Austria @-@ Hungary in June 1917 . 
 When handed over by the Germans on 21 July , UB @-@ 47 was in a " worn out condition " . Despite the rough condition of the boat , the U @-@ boat was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 30 July 1917 as SM U @-@ 47 , dropping the B from the U @-@ boat 's former designation . Linienschiffsleutnant Otto Molitor was installed as the U @-@ boat 's new commander . U @-@ 47 's first success in Austro @-@ Hungarian service came nearly six months later when , on 12 January 1918 , Molitor torpedoed the French steamer Mica from Saigon just short of her destination of Milos . 
 In early April , Linienschiffsleutnant Freiherr Hugo von Seyffertitz replaced Molitor as commander of U @-@ 47 , and a month later , von Seyffertitz achieved his first success as U @-@ 47 's commander . The British steamer <unk> , a 5 @,@ 203 GRT ship built in 1900 , was sunk north of Susa , Libya , with one man killed . The next victory for von Seyffertitz and U @-@ 47 came in September . On the 20th U @-@ 47 launched a torpedo attack against the submarine Circé off Cattaro , sinking the French boat . 
 At the end of the war , U @-@ 47 was at Cattaro . In her Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy career , U @-@ 47 sank two merchant ships of 6 @,@ 467 gross register tons , and sank a single warship of 351 tonnes ( 345 long tons ) displacement . U @-@ 47 was ceded to France as a war reparation in 1920 , towed to Bizerta , and broken up there within a year .

 = Education in Malta = 
 Education in Malta is compulsory through age sixteen and is offered through three different providers : the state , the church , and the private sector . The state is responsible for promoting education and instruction and ensuring universal access to education for all Maltese citizens the existence of a system of schools and institutions accessible to all Maltese citizens . The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and moral development and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy . Although Maltese citizens had access to education during the Arab occupation of 870 to 1090 , the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious @-@ based education to the island for wealthy families . The arrival of the Knights Hospitaller saw the establishment of the University of Malta , around which a number of primary , secondary and post @-@ secondary institutions were established . Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798 , when state @-@ funded elementary schooling was established . In 1878 , English replaced Italian as the primary language of instruction , and education was made compulsory in 1946 in response to a number of children not attending school due to poverty between World Wars One and Two . The age at which education became compulsory was lowered to five years in 1988 . 
 Malta 's educational system is structured in four stages : pre @-@ primary ( ages 3 – 5 ) , primary ( ages 5 – 11 ) , secondary ( ages 11 – 16 ) and tertiary . Pre @-@ primary education is optional but fully funded by the state . In their last two years of primary education , students are placed on tracks based on educational attainment , and at the age of eleven , students sit an eleven plus examination to determine a student 's secondary schooling direction . Success in the eleven plus exam places a student in a junior lyceum - a prestigious secondary school - while mediocre performance or not sitting the examination places a student in a less competitive secondary school . Secondary Education Certificate ( SEC ) examinations are taken at age 16 , and matriculation examinations are taken at age 18 to determine university entrance eligibility . In 2008 , 26 @,@ 711 primary students , 25 @,@ 793 secondary students , 5 @,@ 719 post @-@ secondary students , 9 @,@ 472 tertiary students and 6 @,@ 268 vocational students were enrolled in educational courses in Malta . Approximately 30 per cent of Malta 's primary and secondary school students are enrolled in private schools , most of which are operated by the Catholic Church . Malta 's highest post @-@ secondary institution is the University of Malta , which has operated since 1592 . 
 = = History = = 
 While education in Malta dates back to the period of Arab occupation between 870 and 1090 through the introduction of Arabic numerals , the arrival of the Franciscans in 1350 , the Carmelites in 1418 , the Dominican Order in 1450 , the Augustinians in 1460 and the Friars Minor in 1492 brought religious @-@ based education to the island . Members of these groups were asked to serve as private tutors for the children of wealthy parents , and later moved to set up classes for instruction in Italian , Latin and numeracy . In 1592 , the Collegium <unk> ( what was to become the University of Malta ) was established by the Society of Jesus as a result of a direct order from Pope Clements VIII , and around this institution a number of others flourished , including a grammar school , a preparatory school and institutions for the study of cartography , naval architecture and navigation . In addition to public options , it was possible to hire private tutors in a number of different areas , including accounting , philosophy , navigation and languages . During this period , however , education for those without wealth was non @-@ existent . During the 16th century , philosophy , theology , grammar and the humanities were taught at the Collegium , and following Europe 's temporary recovery from the Black Death in 1675 , the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller appointed a new lecturer in anatomy and surgery at Sacra <unk> , essentially establishing the University of Malta 's medical school . 
 The ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French Republic in 1798 brought a reformation of the educational system with it due to the disparity between the traditional ideals of the Knights and the revolutionary ideals of the French . Private schooling was banned , elementary schooling was introduced and funded by the state , and adult education was introduced . The gradual introduction of universal education for primary school students was an ideal born before and during the French Revolution , while private schools were abolished due to their traditional association with the Catholic Church , an institution rejected by those involved in the Revolution . In addition , Napoleon I abolished the University of Malta just five days after his ejection of the Knights , although this decision was reversed after the British ejected the French the following year . In 1799 , Malta fell under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom , and attempts were made to adjust Malta 's institutions towards a British style . 
 On 1st <unk> 1846 education became effectively compulsory till the age of 14 . In 1847 , elementary schooling was changed to the British model , schools were opened in every village and education was made free of charge . In 1878 , the mode of language education delivery changed following the publication of two reports on the matter . Italian language education was replaced by instruction in the English language , and the use of Maltese was encouraged in the primary years . However , English was the language in which education was delivered at all stages of education following primary school . Debate continued until the 1930s over which language should be used in Maltese education - Italian or English . 
 During World War I , the interwar years and World War II , widespread poverty in Malta prevented the children of the lower classes from pursuing basic education in favor of staying home to assist parents with agricultural work and other income earning activities . To counteract this phenomenon , education was declared compulsory in 1946 . In 1964 , Malta became an independent nation , and in 1988 a new Education Act was passed , lowering the compulsory education age to five years , decentralising educational decision making and establishing a right for any person to apply for a licence to open a school . The Faculty of Arts , Sciences and Theology at the University of Malta was also reinstated .

Malta ranks equal eleventh in the world on the national IQ scale . 
 The compulsory education period in Malta has been between five and 16 years of age since the introduction of the Education Act 1988 . This is an increase from up to 12 years of age in 1924 ( in this year , school attendance became compulsory for those already enrolled - the act of enrollment itself was not compulsory ) and 14 years of age in 1946 , when compulsory school attendance was introduced for all students , enrolled or otherwise . Compulsory schooling has always applied to both males and females during its existence .

 Schooling is compulsory from the age of five , although free @-@ of @-@ charge kindergarten is available to all students beginning at age three . Approximately 94 per cent of three- and four @-@ year @-@ olds attend kindergarten . A number of private operators exist , but free state @-@ run institutions are also popular . State @-@ run Maltese kindergartens are required to have one staff member present for every ten children present , while this ratio decreases to 1 : 20 for independently run institutions . During the kindergarten years , the focus is on play , not formal education . From kindergarten , students transition to primary school , which is compulsory from the age of five . Since 1980 , all state @-@ run primary schools have been co @-@ educational , with many independent schools following suit . However , church @-@ run primary schools are usually single @-@ sex . Classes usually have a limit of thirty students , and a minimum teacher to student ratio has been set at 1 : 19 in all schools , whether they be state @-@ run , church @-@ run or independent . 
 Formal end @-@ of @-@ year examinations commence starting in Year 4 to dictate class streaming arrangements for the following year . Students are examined in English , Maltese , mathematics , religion and social studies . Despite the fact that eleven @-@ plus examinations highlight inequality and failures , and are recognized as ineffective educational tools by experts , Malta still implements such exams . In Year 6 , when most pupils have turned eleven years of age , an eleven @-@ plus exam is given to students to determine which students attend which secondary schools . Students are tested in English language , Maltese language , mathematics , social studies and religion ; the latter is optional for those not adhering to the faith taught in schools . While 73 per cent of eleven @-@ year @-@ old students sat the eleven @-@ plus exam in 2001 , only about 54 percent pass it each year . Students achieving success in the eleven @-@ plus exam go on to attend prestigious ' junior lyceums ' during their secondary years , whilst those who do not attend ' area secondary schools ' . This is similar to the operation of the Tripartite System in the United Kingdom following World War II . 
 State @-@ run junior lyceums and area secondary schools are single @-@ sex . Junior lyceums are divided into two grade stages . The first stage is an introductory stage , and runs for the first two years of secondary schooling . Students study essentially the same subjects with very limited curriculum options in order to provide a good grounding for future studies . Following the two @-@ year introductory cycle , a three @-@ year specialist stage occurs during which students study a common core curriculum as well as a number of elective subjects . This orientation is similar at area secondary schools , although the introductory period is longer , at three years in duration , and the final specialist period is shorter , at two years . The staff @-@ student ratio is set at 1 : 11 , and the school leaving age is 16 . 
 Examinations in Maltese secondary schools are taken at both age 16 and 18 , with the latter being a final optional set of matriculation examinations . The examinations taken at age 16 are the Secondary Education Certificate ( SEC ) exams , which have operated since 1994 , before which the GCE Ordinary Level was used as a secondary certificate examination . The examinations taken at 18 , those enabling entry into university , are the Matriculation Certificate examinations , based on the International Baccalaureate . These examinations replaced the GCE Advanced Levels .

 A number of students travel to school using the nation 's bus network , which is free for state school students to use . Schools in Malta generally begin their school day at 8 : 30am and finish at 2 : 40pm . The 2010 @-@ 11 school year commenced on September 27 , 2010 , and will conclude on June 28 , 2011 . Students receive three days of holidays in November 15 days of holidays over Christmas , two days of holidays in March and eight days of holidays in April , in addition to public holidays . Maltese school students receive the highest number of days off of all school students in Europe , with 90 days during the 2010 @-@ 11 academic year being non @-@ school days . This is 14 days more than the European average of 76 . Virtually all Maltese state schools run tuck shops , while some secondary schools are home to cafeterias . 
 State schools provide textbooks free of charge to their students , while private schools generally require their students to pay for their textbooks , enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently . All primary schools have at least four computers , one printer , a large monitor and a teacher 's laptop computer in their classrooms , while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology . An average of 22 @.@ 5 students are enrolled per primary school class , with the average rising to 24 @.@ 3 in secondary school classes . Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese , English and mathematics , one hour per week to science , two hours per weeks to arts and crafts , two hours per week to social studies , one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies , and two and a half hours per week to physical education and religion . State school syllabi at the secondary level are set by the local examination bodies .

 Under the Education Act of 1988 , the Government of Malta is obligated to provide free university education to eligible residents with sufficient qualifications for entry . However , due to funding constraints , the University of Malta offers some courses only every other year in order to maximise course offerings with optimum funding usage . 10 @,@ 000 students currently study at the University .

 State @-@ run education in Malta is administered at the national level of government , with the Minister for Education empowered to make orders , or ' Legal Notices ' , relating to the administration of education throughout the country . The Minister for Education is appointed by the President on advice of the Prime Minister and is responsible for a number of education @-@ related government functions ( such as the operation of schools and libraries ) as well as tertiary education in the country . The Ministry of Education , the national government department responsible for education in Malta , is headed by a Permanent Secretary . The Education Division of the Ministry is responsible for setting a number of annual nationwide examinations , managing human resources in Malta 's educational system , selecting school textbook lists , allocating students to schools based on area , managing the Ministry 's educational finances and promoting a number of cultural , sporting and social activities . Malta 's Ministry of Education is currently being decentralised with the aim of having schools managed at the local level . 
 With the exception of the currently occurring educational management decentralisation process , regional administration of education in Malta is limited . However , the island of Gozo does maintain a form of regional educational administration through the Ministry for Gozo . Although the Ministry for Education manages education throughout Malta , the Ministry for Gozo is responsible for the remuneration of the island 's teaching staff . Local authorities such as Malta 's numerous Local Councils have no official ties to Malta 's educational system but often donate to local schools and maintain preschool building structures . 
 = = = Teacher development = = = 
 Primary and secondary school teachers begin their teacher education at the University of Malta by gaining a Bachelor of Education ( Honours ) , which typically takes four years of study to achieve . To gain entry into the University to study primary or secondary education , students must not only meet the University 's general entry requirements but also a number of other special course requirements . University students seeking to enter the teaching profession may also become qualified by gaining a postgraduate certificate in education . Two years of professional teaching practice is also generally required . The Minister for Education may also grant a temporary warrant to teach , valid for one year , to any person the Minister believes has the ability to teach in the country . 
 In 2007 , teachers entering the workforce were paid a minimum of € 14 @,@ 291 per year , with the most experienced teachers being paid € 19 @,@ 371 per year .

 = Alfred Döblin = 
 Bruno Alfred Döblin ( August 10 , 1878 – June 26 , 1957 ) was a German novelist , essayist , and doctor , best known for his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz ( 1929 ) . A prolific writer whose œuvre spans more than half a century and a wide variety of literary movements and styles , Döblin is one of the most important figures of German literary modernism . His complete works comprise over a dozen novels ranging in genre from historical novels to science fiction to novels about the modern metropolis ; several dramas , radio plays , and screenplays ; a true crime story ; a travel account ; two book @-@ length philosophical treatises ; scores of essays on politics , religion , art , and society ; and numerous letters — his complete works , republished by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and Fischer Verlag , span more than thirty volumes . His first published novel , Die drei Sprünge des Wang @-@ lung ( The Three Leaps of Wang Lun ) , appeared in 1915 and his final novel , Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende ( Tales of a Long Night ) was published in 1956 , one year before his death . 
 Born in Stettin , Germany ( now Szczecin , Poland ) , to assimilated Jews , Döblin moved with his mother and siblings to Berlin when he was ten years old after his father had abandoned them . Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next forty @-@ five years , engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar @-@ era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists , Bertolt Brecht , and Thomas Mann . Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of Berlin Alexanderplatz , Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship . He spent 1933 – 1940 in France and then was forced to flee again at the start of the Second World War . Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles , where he converted to Catholicism . He moved to West Germany after the war but did not feel at home in postwar Germany 's conservative cultural climate and returned to France . His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties , and his literary work was met with relative neglect . 
 Despite the canonic status of Berlin Alexanderplatz , Döblin is often characterized as an under @-@ recognized or even as a forgotten author ; while his work has received increasing critical attention ( mostly in German ) over the last few decades , he is much less well known by the reading public than other representatives of German modernism such as Thomas Mann , Bertolt Brecht , or Franz Kafka .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Bruno Alfred Döblin was born on 10 August 1878 at the house at <unk> 37 in Stettin ( Szczecin ) , a port city in what was then the Province of Pomerania . He was the fourth of five children born to Max Döblin ( 1846 – 1921 ) , a master tailor from Posen ( Poznań ) , and Sophie Döblin ( 1844 – 1920 ) , née <unk> , the daughter of a merchant . Their marriage was characterized by a tension between Max 's multifaceted artistic interests — to which Döblin would later attribute his and his siblings ' artistic inclinations — and Sophie 's cool pragmatism . The <unk> were assimilated Jews , and Alfred became aware of a broad , societal anti @-@ Semitism early on . 
 His parents ' marriage dissolved in July 1888 , when Max Döblin eloped with Henriette Zander , a seamstress twenty years his junior , and moved to America to start a new life . The catastrophic loss of his father was a central event in Döblin 's childhood and would be formative for his later life . Shortly thereafter , in October 1888 , Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby apartment on the <unk> in Berlin 's working @-@ class east . Döblin 's parents briefly reconciled in 1889 , when Max returned penniless from America ; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889 , but when it came to light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life , Sophie and the children returned to Berlin in September 1889 . 
 The sense of being déclassé , along with rocky experiences at school , made this a difficult time for Döblin . Although he had early been a good student , starting in his fourth year of Gymnasium his performance tended toward the mediocre . Furthermore , his oppositional tendencies against the stern conventionality of the <unk> , militaristic <unk> educational system , which stood in contrast to his artistic inclinations and his free thought , earned him the status of a rebel among his teachers . Despite his hatred for school , Döblin early became a passionate writer and reader , counting Spinoza , Schopenhauer , and Nietzsche , as well as Heinrich von Kleist , Friedrich Hölderlin , and Fyodor Dostoyevsky among his most important early influences . He wrote his first novel , <unk> Rosse ( Rushing Steeds ) , before completing school and dedicated it to the " Manes of Hölderlin " . He sent a copy to the prominent critic and philosopher Fritz <unk> who returned it a few days later . However , wishing to hide his artistic inclinations from his mother , Döblin had sent the manuscript under a false name , and was not able to retrieve it at the post office ; he thus had to rewrite it entirely . 
 = = = 1900 – 1914 : University years and early career = = = 
 After receiving his Abitur in 1900 , Döblin enrolled at Friedrich Wilhelm University ( now Humboldt University of Berlin ) and began studying general medicine . In May 1904 he moved to Freiburg im Breisgau to continue his studies , concentrating on neurology and psychiatry . He began his dissertation ( " Disturbances of memory in Korsakoff 's Psychosis " ) in the winter semester of 1904 – 1905 at the Freiburg psychiatric clinic . His dissertation , completed in April 1905 , was published that year by Berlin 's <unk> Verlag . He applied for assistantships in Berlin and in Stettin , where he was apparently turned down on account of his Jewish origins , before taking a short @-@ lived position as assistant doctor at a regional asylum in Regensburg . On 15 October 1906 he took up a position at the Berlin psychiatric clinic in Buch where he worked as an assistant doctor for nearly two years . He then transferred to the city hospital " Am Urban , " where he dedicated himself to internal medicine with a renewed interest . He opened his first private practice in October 1911 at <unk> 18 in Berlin 's Kreuzberg neighborhood , before moving the practice to Frankfurter Allee 184 in Berlin 's working @-@ class east . 
 While working in Buch he met Friede Kunke , a 16 @-@ year @-@ old nurse from a Protestant background with whom he became romantically involved . In the spring of 1909 he began seeing the 21 @-@ year @-@ old Erna Reiss , a medical student and daughter of a wealthy Jewish factory owner . Despite his continued involvement with Kunke , at the urging of his family he was reluctantly engaged to Reiss on 13 February 1911 and married her on 23 January 1912 ; his younger brother Hugo and Herwarth Walden served as best men . During the early part of his engagement to Reiss , he had been unaware that Kunke was pregnant : their son Bodo was born on 14 October 1911 and was raised by his grandmother , Elise Kunke , in Schleswig @-@ Holstein following Friede 's death from tuberculosis in 1918 . Until the end of his life , Döblin maintained loose contact with Bodo , and his treatment of Friede became a lasting source of guilt . Döblin 's first son with Erna Reiss , Peter Döblin , was born on 27 October 1912 , and was baptized a Protestant . 
 During his studies in Berlin , Döblin had written his second novel , Der Schwarze Vorhang ( The Black Curtain ) . The novel portrays the developing sexuality of its protagonist , Johannes , and explores the themes of love , hate , and sadism ; in its use of literary montage , The Black Curtain already presages the radical techniques that Döblin would later pioneer in Berlin Alexanderplatz . Introduced by a mutual acquaintance , Döblin met Georg Lewin , a music student better known as Herwarth Walden , who founded the Expressionist journal Der Sturm in 1910 . Der Sturm , modeled after Karl Kraus 's newspaper Die <unk> ( The Torch ) , would soon count Döblin among its most involved contributors , and provided him with a venue for the publication of numerous literary and <unk> contributions . Through Walden Döblin made the acquaintance of poet Else Lasker @-@ <unk> . At regular meetings at the Café des <unk> on Kurfürstendamm or at the wine bar <unk> , Döblin got to know the circle of artists and intellectuals that would become central to the Expressionist movement in Berlin , including Peter Hille , Richard <unk> , Erich Mühsam , Paul <unk> , and Frank Wedekind , among others . In October 1911 he met the painter Ernst Ludwig Kirchner , who painted several portraits of Döblin between 1912 and 1914 and illustrated some of Döblin 's literary works . Döblin 's early novel Der Schwarze Vorhang was published in Der Sturm , and in November 1912 the Munich publishing house Georg Müller published his collection of novellas under the title Die <unk> einer <unk> und andere <unk> . In May 1913 he completed his third novel The Three Leaps of Wang Lun ( Die drei Sprünge des Wang @-@ lun ) . Published in 1916 , this historical novel about political uprising in 18th @-@ century China was a literary breakthrough for Döblin , earning him literary acclaim , public recognition , and the prestigious Fontane Prize . He began writing Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine ( Wadzek 's Struggle with the Steam Turbine ) the following year , completing it by December 1914 although it was not published until 1918 .

 To avoid conscription , Döblin volunteered in December 1914 and was posted to Saargemünd ( Sarreguemines ) as a doctor . Despite sharing in the widespread early enthusiasm for the war among German intellectuals , he soon developed a pacifist disposition . His son Wolfgang was born on 17 March 1915 , followed by the births of Klaus on 20 May 1917 and Stefan on 7 December 1926 . In Saargemünd the family lived in a small apartment at <unk> 19 ; due to their financial situation they had to give up their Berlin apartment at the end of February 1915 . 
 At the end of August , 1916 , Döblin was awarded the Fontane Prize ( including a monetary award of 600 Marks ) for The Three Leaps of Wang Lun ( Die drei Sprünge des Wang @-@ lun ) , which tells the story of political upheaval in 18th century China . Following this recognition , Döblin set himself to work on his historical novel Wallenstein , set during the Thirty Years ' War . Döblin had to interrupt work on the novel in March 1917 because he had caught typhus , but was able to use the university library at Heidelberg during his convalescence in April and May to continue researching the Thirty Years ' War . Back in Saargemünd he came into conflict with his superiors due to the poor treatment of the patients ; on 2 August 1917 he was transferred to <unk> ( Haguenau ) in Alsace , where the library of nearby Strassbourg helped complete Wallenstein by the beginning of 1919 . 
 At the beginning of 1919 Döblin moved into his new apartment and medical practice at Frankfurter Allee 340 in Berlin . The immediate postwar period was a turbulent time for him — his financial situation was dire , and the death of his sister Meta on 12 March 1919 as the result of an injury sustained during skirmishes between the Spartacists and nationalist troops in Berlin showed how volatile the situation in Germany was in the aftermath of the November Revolution . The years during and immediately after the war also marked Döblin 's growing politicization ; although he never joined a party he identified with the political left . During this time Döblin wrote a number of satirical and polemical political essays under the pseudonym " Linke Poot , " a dialectical variation of " Linke <unk> " ( Left Paw ) , eleven of which were published in 1921 in a volume called Der deutsche <unk> ( The German Masked Ball ) . 
 In February 1921 he met the 21 @-@ year @-@ old photographer Charlotte ( " <unk> " ) Niclas ; the close romantic relationship between the two was to last many years , despite their age difference . The same year , following a family vacation to the Baltic coast , he began preparatory work on his science fiction novel Berge Meere und Giganten ( Mountains Seas and Giants ) , which would be published in 1924 . In 1920 Döblin joined the Association of German Writers ( <unk> Deutscher <unk> ) , and in 1924 he became its president . In November 1921 he began reviewing plays for the Prager Tagblatt , and in 1925 joined the Gruppe 1925 , a discussion circle of progressive and communist intellectuals including Bertolt Brecht , Johannes R. Becher , Ernst Bloch , Hermann <unk> , Rudolf Leonhard , Walter <unk> , Robert Musil , Joseph Roth , Ernst Toller , Kurt Tucholsky , and Ernst Weiß , among others . It was likely Brecht , who counted Döblin among his significant influences , who introduced him to Erwin Piscator in 1928 . 
 At the end of September 1924 , he set out on a two @-@ month trip through Poland , subsidized by the Fischer Verlag and prompted in part by the anti @-@ Semitic pogroms in Berlin 's <unk> of 1923 , an event that awakened Döblin 's interest in Judaism . His description of his travels to Warsaw , Vilnius , Lviv , and Kraków , among other cities , was published in November 1925 under the title Reise in Polen ( Journey to Poland ) . From 1926 to 1927 Döblin worked on his free verse epic Manas , about a figure from Indian mythology , which was published in May 1927 . Manas , like his philosophical tract Das Ich über der Natur published the same year , proved to be a failure with the public . Thus despite his continued rise to prominence within the intellectual world of the Weimar Republic — in 1928 , for example , he was elected to the prestigious Prussian Academy of Arts with the persistent support of Thomas Mann — literary and economic success continued to elude Döblin . 
 This changed with the October 1929 publication of his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz which earned him national and global fame . One of the best known appraisals of the novel is Walter Benjamin 's essay , " Die Krisis des Romans " ( " The Crisis of the Novel " ) which sees in Berlin Alexanderplatz 's radical use of montage a solution to the <unk> of the traditional novel . Döblin soon began transforming Berlin Alexanderplatz into a radio play and agreed to <unk> the screenplay for the film version that premiered on 8 October 1931 . The early 1930s marked the high point of Döblin 's fame . During this time he busied himself with lectures , readings , and the effort to contribute to a collective intellectual response to the growing power of the National Socialists . Just over a month after Hitler 's ascension to power , Döblin left Germany , crossing into Switzerland on 2 March 1933 .

 After a brief stay in Zürich , the family moved to Paris . Döblin 's closest acquaintances during this time were Claire and Yvan <unk> , Hermann <unk> , Arthur Koestler , Joseph Roth , Hans Sahl , and <unk> Sperber . Here he also saw Robert Musil , with whom he had kept up a sporadic relationship for over a decade , for the last time . Döblin finished his novel <unk> <unk> at the end of 1933 . In 1935 he began work on his Amazon Trilogy , which narrates the colonization and Christianization of South America and was published in 1937 – 1938 . During this time he also began work on his four @-@ part novel project November 1918 about the revolution in Germany at the end of the First World War . He acquired French nationality in October 1936 . In May 1939 he briefly visited the United States to take part in a PEN congress in New York . With other writers , he met with Roosevelt at the White House , and saw his old Berlin acquaintance Ernst Toller again , who was suffering from severe depression and killed himself shortly thereafter . 
 After the start of the Second World War the family fled Paris ; Döblin 's manuscripts were able to be brought into safekeeping in the basement of the Sorbonne . Between the start of the war in 1939 and the German occupation of France in 1940 , Döblin worked for the French ministry of information , writing counter @-@ propaganda texts against Nazi Germany with a group of French Germanists and journalists , as well as artists like Frans Masereel . 
 In 1940 , aged 62 , he was again uprooted by the German invasion of France , and spent weeks in a refugee camp in Mende . During this time he began attending mass at the cathedral in Mende , a turn towards Christianity that would culminate in his religious conversion the following year . On 3 September 1940 Alfred , Erna , and Stefan boarded the Nea Hellas in Lisbon , reaching New York six days later ; in October they moved to Los Angeles . Döblin worked briefly for Metro Goldwyn Mayer writing screenplays for 100 dollars a week , but his contract expired in October 1941 and was not renewed , despite the interventions of Thomas Mann and others . Alfred , Erna , and Stefan were baptized as Roman Catholics in Hollywood 's Blessed Sacrament Church on 30 November 1941 . 
 Döblin completed work on November 1918 in the spring of 1943 , but was unable to find a publisher . The only work of his that was published in German during his American exile was a private printing of 250 copies of the Nocturno episode from November 1918 . Döblin was embittered by his isolation and setbacks in exile , drawing a strong distinction between his own situation and that of more successful writers less oppressed by material concerns , such as Lion Feuchtwanger and Thomas Mann . In honor of his 65th birthday , Helene Weigel organized a party on 14 August 1943 in Santa Monica . In attendance were Thomas Mann , Franz Werfel , Lion Feuchtwanger , and Bertolt Brecht , among others . Heinrich Mann gave a speech , Fritz <unk> , Peter Lorre , and Alexander <unk> read aloud from Döblin 's works , and he was presented with notes of congratulation and praise from Brecht , Max Horkheimer , and Alfred Polgar , among others . Compositions by Hanns Eisler were performed , and Blandine <unk> sang Berlin chansons . Yet the festivities were dampened when Döblin gave a speech in which he mentioned his conversion to Catholicism ; the religious , moral tone proved alienating , and fell on unsympathetic ears . 
 In 1945 Döblin 's 18 @-@ year @-@ old son Stefan was called up for military service in the French army . That spring had brought the good news that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance , and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead , having committed suicide five years earlier . In October 1945 Alfred and Erna arrived in New York , sailing aboard the Argentine back to Europe . They first settled in Baden @-@ Baden where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative for the office of public education ; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication , and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism , such as Ernst Jünger or Gottfried Benn . In postwar Germany 's conservative cultural climate , Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author , yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany 's intellectual and cultural life , reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and fostering the growth of younger writers . Despite these efforts , Döblin was disappointed by the apparent continuity between the Nazi years and the postwar climate . His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of isolation and marginalization within the postwar German literary scene . In 1953 Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in East Berlin . 
 His last novel , Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende ( Tales of a Long Night ) , was published in 1956 , and was favorably received . Döblin 's remaining years were marked by poor health ( he had Parkinson 's disease ) and lengthy stays in multiple clinics and hospitals , including his alma mater , Freiburg University . Through the intervention of Theodor Heuss and Joachim <unk> , he was able to receive more money from the Berlin office in charge of compensating victims of Nazi persecution ; this , and a literary prize from the Mainz Academy in the sum of 10 @,@ 000 DM helped finance his growing medical expenses . 
 Alfred Döblin died in the hospital in Emmendingen on 26 June 1957 and was buried two days later in the village cemetery at <unk> next to his son Wolfgang . Erna took her life on 15 September and was buried next to Alfred .

 = = = The Three Leaps of Wang Lun = = = 
 Die drei Sprünge des Wang @-@ lun ( The Three Leaps of Wang Lun ) was Döblin 's third novel ( although it was the first to be published as a book ) , and garnered him the Fontane Prize . Published in 1916 , ( although back @-@ dated to 1915 ) , this epic historical novel narrates upheaval and revolution in 18th @-@ century China , and was favorably received by critics , who praised its detailed and exotic depictions of China . Wang Lun also had an influence on younger German writers , including Lion Feuchtwanger , Anna Seghers , and Bertolt Brecht ; for the latter , Wang Lun provided an impulse for the development of the theory of epic theatre . In commercial sales , it is Döblin 's most successful novel after Berlin Alexanderplatz . 
 = = = Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine = = = 
 Döblin 's 1918 comic novel has been seen , in its experimental narrative technique , its refusal to psychologize its characters , and its depictions of Berlin as modern metropolis , as a precursor to Döblin 's better @-@ known Berlin Alexanderplatz . Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine ( Wadzek 's Battle with the Steam Turbine ) tells the story of Wadzek , a factory owner locked in a losing battle with a more powerful competitor . His futile and increasingly delusional countermeasures culminate in the fortification and quixotic defense of his family 's garden house in suburban Reinickendorf . Following the dissipation of this endeavor , he suffers a breakdown and finally flees the country , eloping aboard a steamship bound for America that is powered by the steam turbines of his victorious competitor . Döblin wrote the novel in the fall of 1914 , submitting it to extensive stylistic revisions while serving as a doctor on the Western front ; it was published in May 1918 by the Fischer Verlag . In its stringent refusal of a tragic tone , the book earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht . 
 = = = Wallenstein = = = 
 Although Döblin 's 1920 epic about the Thirty Years ' War was in general favorably received by critics , he was disappointed with the reception because he felt he had created in Wallenstein a peerless work ; as a consequence , he wrote a scathing critique of critics which he published in 1921 under the title Der <unk> , sein Stoff und die Kritik ( The Epic Poet , his Material , and Critique ) . The novel centers on the tension between Ferdinand II , Holy Roman Emperor and his general , Albrecht von Wallenstein ; Wallenstein represents a new type of warfare characterized by ruthless Realpolitik and capitalist expansion while Ferdinand becomes increasingly overwhelmed by the course of events and gradually retreats from politics altogether . Döblin 's approach to narrating the war differed from prevailing historiography in that , rather than interpreting the Thirty Years ' War primarily as a religious conflict , he portrays it critically as the absurd consequence of a combination of national @-@ political , financial , and individual psychological factors . Döblin saw a strong similarity between the Thirty Years ' War and the First World War , during which he wrote Wallenstein . The novel is counted among the most innovative and significant historical novels in the German literary tradition . 
 = = = Berge Meere und Giganten = = = 
 Döblin 's 1924 science fiction novel recounts the course of human history from the 20th to the 27th century , portraying it as a catastrophic global struggle between technological mania , natural forces , and competing political visions . Berge Meere und Giganten ( Mountains Seas and Giants ) presciently invokes such topics as urbanization , the alienation from nature , ecological devastation , mechanization , the dehumanization of the modern world , as well as mass migration , globalization , totalitarianism , fanaticism , terrorism , state surveillance , genetic engineering , synthetic food , the breeding of humans , biochemical warfare , and others . Stylistically and structurally experimental , it was regarded as a difficult work when it first came out and has often polarized critics . Among others , Günter Grass has praised the novel 's continued relevance and insight . 
 = = = Berlin Alexanderplatz = = = 
 Generally considered Döblin 's masterpiece , Berlin Alexanderplatz has become an iconic text of the Weimar Republic . Published in 1929 , its innovative use of literary montage as well as its panoramic portrayal of a modern metropolis have earned it a place among the key works of literary modernism . Berlin Alexanderplatz tells the story of Franz Biberkopf , who as the novel opens has just been released from prison for killing his lover . Although he seeks to become respectable , he is quickly drawn into a struggle " with something that comes from without , that is unpredictable and looks like a destiny . " Biberkopf suffers a series of setbacks and catastrophes , including the murder of his lover and the loss of an arm . The novel earned Döblin global recognition and literary celebrity , and has been filmed twice , once in the 1931 Berlin @-@ Alexanderplatz , directed by Phil <unk> and starring Heinrich George as Biberkopf , and then again in Rainer Werner Fassbinder 's 1980 14 @-@ part television film . In a 2002 poll of 100 noted writers from around the world , Berlin Alexanderplatz was named among the top 100 books of all time .

 November 1918 : A German Revolution ( November 1918 , eine deutsche Revolution ) is a novel tetralogy about the German Revolution of 1918 – 1919 . The four volumes — Vol . I : Bürger und Soldaten ( Citizens and Soldiers ) , Vol . II <unk> Volk ( A People Betrayed ) , Vol . III , Heimkehr der <unk> ( Return of the Frontline Troops ) , and Vol . IV , Karl und Rosa ( Karl and Rosa ) — together comprise the most significant work from Döblin 's period of exile ( 1933 – 1945 ) . The work was highly praised by figures such as Bertolt Brecht , and critic Gabriele Sander has described November 1918 as representing the culmination of Döblin 's work in the genre of the historical novel . 
 = = = Tales of a Long Night = = = 
 Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende ( Tales of a Long Night ) ( 1956 ) was Döblin 's last novel . Set in England immediately after the Second World War , the novel narrates the story of Edward Allison , an English soldier who had been badly wounded during the war . Back among his family , Edward must deal with his war trauma , long buried family conflicts , and his destabilized sense of self . The novel treats such themes as the search for the self , guilt and responsibility , the struggle between the sexes , war and violence , and religion , among others . Döblin wrote the novel between August 1945 and October 1946 , although it was not published until a decade later . Upon its 1956 release by the East Berlin publishing house Rütten & Loening , the novel was well received . The reference to Hamlet in the German title was likely motivated by Döblin 's reading of Sigmund Freud 's interpretation of Shakespeare 's Hamlet . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Döblin is generally considered one of the most important German writers of the twentieth century ; yet popular perception of his work rests almost exclusively on Berlin Alexanderplatz , considered the canonical German novel of the modern metropolis ( " <unk> " ) . His writing is characterized by an innovative use of montage and perspectival play , as well as what he dubbed in 1913 a " fantasy of fact " ( " <unk> " ) — an interdisciplinary poetics that draws on modern discourses ranging from the psychiatric to the anthropological to the theological , in order to " register and articulate sensory experience and to open up his prose to new areas of knowledge . " His engagement with such key movements of the European avant @-@ garde as futurism , expressionism , <unk> , and Neue <unk> has led critic Sabina Becker to call him " perhaps the most significant representative of literary modernism in Berlin . " 
 In a 1967 essay , Günter Grass declared : " Without the Futurist elements of Döblin 's work from Wang Lun to Berlin Alexanderplatz , my prose is inconceivable . " Döblin was also an influence on writers such as W.G. Sebald and Bertolt Brecht ; as Brecht wrote in 1943 , " I learned more about the essence of the epic from Döblin than from anyone else . His epic writing and even his theory about the epic strongly influenced my own dramatic art . " 
 Modern , well @-@ edited , critical volumes of almost the complete œuvre have been appearing in German since the 1980s , published by Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag and , since 2008 , by the Fischer Verlag ; and the Internationale Alfred @-@ Döblin <unk> have been held every two years since the early 1980s . But only a handful of other works of fiction have ever appeared in English translations : The Three Leaps of Wang Lun ( trans . C. D. Godwin , Chinese University Press , Hong Kong , 1991 ) , and the November 1918 trilogy : A People Betrayed ( which also includes The Troops Return ) and Karl and Rosa ( trans . John E.

 = Es ist euch gut , daß ich hingehe , BWV 108 = 
 Es ist euch gut , daß ich hingehe ( It is good for you that I leave ) , BWV 108 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed it in Leipzig for Cantate Sunday , the fourth Sunday after Easter , and first performed it on 29 April 1725 . 
 It is the second of nine cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler , with whom he collaborated at the end of his second cantata cycle . She used two quotations from the prescribed gospel from the Farewell discourses and closed the cantata with a stanza Paul Gerhardt 's " Gott Vater , <unk> deinen Geist " . The topic is the prediction of Jesus of his parting and the coming of the Spirit as a comforter . The first announcement is sung by the bass as the vox Christi , the second , in the centre of the work , by the chorus in three fugues combined in motet style but unified by similar themes . Bach scored the cantata for three vocal soloists ( alto , tenor and bass ) , a four @-@ part choir , and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes d 'amore , strings and continuo . He used elements of word @-@ painting , such as very long notes to illustrate firm belief , and sigh motifs interrupted by rests to illustrate the desiring heart . 
 = = History and words = = 
 Bach composed the cantata in his second year in Leipzig for the fourth Sunday after Easter , called Cantate . The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle of James , " Every good gift comes from the Father of lights " ( James 1 : 17 – 21 ) , and from the Gospel of John , Jesus announcing the Comforter in his Farewell discourses ( John 16 : 5 – 15 ) . In his second year Bach had composed chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity and Palm Sunday , but for Easter returned to cantatas on more varied texts , possibly because he lost his librettist . 
 Between Easter and Pentecost Bach ´ s congregation heard a series of nine cantatas with texts by a new librettist , Christiana Mariana von Ziegler . As the average interval between the performances was less than a week ( they were not only for Sundays ; there were additional ones for Ascension Day and Pentecost ) , Bach may have been composed at a correspondingly intense rate , although it is not known when he began work on them . The first of the series was Ihr werdet weinen und heulen , BWV 103 , followed a week later by Es ist euch gut , daß ich hingehe . It begins with a bass solo as the vox Christi delivering a quotation from the gospel ( John 16 : 7 ) ; a second quotation appears in movement 4 ( John 16 : 13 ) . Movements 2 and 3 deal with the hope for salvation ; movement 5 is a prayer for guidance until death . The poet used as the closing chorale the tenth stanza of Paul Gerhardt 's hymn " Gott Vater , <unk> deinen Geist " ( 1653 ) , expressing faith in God 's guidance . 
 = = = Publication = = = 
 The cantata text was published in 1728 in Ziegler 's first collection , <unk> in <unk> <unk> . The version set by Bach was slightly different , as he shortened the text here as in other cantatas by the same librettist . The music survived in a holograph manuscript , but was not published until 1876 when the cantata appeared in the Bach Gesellschaft ´ s first complete edition of Bach ´ s work .

 = = = Structure and scoring = = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in six movements , beginning with a biblical quotation for the vox Christi , Jesus speaking . A set of aria and recitative is followed by a chorus on another biblical quotation from the gospel , while an aria leads to the closing chorale . Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists ( alto ( A ) , tenor ( T ) and bass ( B ) ) , a four @-@ part choir , and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes d 'amore ( Oa ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) and basso continuo . The duration of the cantata is given as 20 minutes . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The continuo , playing throughout , is not shown .

 The cantata presents similarities to the one Bach wrote the previous year for the same occasion , Wo gehest du hin ? BWV 166 . 
 = = = = 1 = = = = 
 The similarities begin with the first movement , which like that of the previous year ´ s cantata , is given to the bass as the vox Christi . The movement is the quotation of verse 7 from the gospel , beginning : " Es ist euch gut , daß ich hingehe ; denn so ich nicht hingehe , kömmt der <unk> nicht zu euch . " ( It is good for you that I leave ; for if I did not go , the Comforter would not come to you . ) It is between aria and arioso . An oboe d 'amore as the obbligato instrument plays extended melodies . Voice and oboe share the musical material , conveying " the mood of grieving at parting " .

 The following aria , " Mich kann <unk> Zweifel <unk> " ( No doubt can disturb me ) , is dominated by a virtuoso solo violin . The words " Ich <unk> " ( I believe ) are illustrated by very long notes in the voice , while an ostinato bass line renders " steadfastness " in a different way . The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that Bach uses the key F @-@ sharp minor selectively , " often for slowish movements of great expressive force " , for example for the alto aria <unk> und <unk> from his St Matthew Passion .

 The next biblical quotation , verse 13 of the gospel , " Wenn aber <unk> , der Geist der Wahrheit , kommen wird , der wird euch in alle Wahrheit <unk> . " ( But when that one , the Spirit of Truth , shall come , He shall lead you into all truth . ) is rendered by the choir . It is divided in three sections , similar to a da capo form . All three parts are fugues , combined in motet style , the instruments playing mostly colla parte with the voices . The second section begins " Denn er wird nicht vom ihm <unk> <unk> " ( For He will not speak of His own accord ) ; the third section expresses " und was <unk> ist , wird er verkündigen " ( and what is to come , He will foretell ) , on a fugue subject similar to the first , giving the movement a " feeling of unity " .

 = Far Eastern Party = 
 The Far Eastern Party was a sledging component of the 1911 – 14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition , which investigated the previously unexplored coastal regions of Antarctica west of Cape Adare . Led by expedition commander Douglas Mawson , the party aimed to explore the area far to the east of their main base in Adélie Land , pushing about 500 miles ( 800 km ) towards Victoria Land . Accompanying Mawson were Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis , a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers , and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz ; the party used sledge dogs to increase their speed across the ice . Initially they made good progress , crossing two huge glaciers on their route south @-@ east . 
 On 14 December 1912 , with the party more than 311 miles ( 501 km ) from the safety of the main base at Cape Denison , Ninnis and the sledge he was walking beside broke through the snow lid of a crevasse and were lost . Their supplies now severely compromised , Mawson and Mertz turned back west , gradually shooting the remaining sledge dogs for food to supplement their scarce rations . As they crossed the first glacier on their return journey Mertz became sick , making progress difficult . After almost a week of making very little headway Mertz died , leaving Mawson to carry on alone . 
 For almost a month he pulled his sledge across the Antarctic , crossing the second glacier , despite an illness that increasingly weakened him . Mawson reached the comparative safety of Aladdin 's Cave — a food depot 5 @.@ 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) from the main base — on 1 February 1913 , only to be trapped there for a week while a blizzard raged outside . As a result , he missed the ship back to Australia ; the SY Aurora had sailed on 8 February , just hours before his return to Cape Denison , after waiting for more than three weeks . With a relief party , Mawson remained at Cape Denison until the Aurora returned the following summer in December 1913 . 
 The causes of Mertz 's death and Mawson 's related illness remain uncertain ; a 1969 study suggested hypervitaminosis A , presumably caused by the men eating the livers of their Greenland Huskies , which are now known to be unusually high in vitamin A. While this is considered the most likely theory , dissenting opinions suggest prolonged cold exposure or psychological stresses . In 1976 explorer and mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary described Mawson 's month @-@ long journey as " probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration " . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Australasian Antarctic Expedition , commanded by Douglas Mawson , explored part of East Antarctica between 1911 and 1914 . The expedition 's main base was established in January 1912 at Cape Denison in Commonwealth Bay , Adélie Land . This was much farther west than originally intended ; dense pack ice had prevented the expedition ship SY Aurora from landing closer to Cape Adare , the original eastern limit . Only after the Aurora — heading west — had rounded the ice tongue of the Mertz Glacier was a landing made . 
 Battling katabatic winds that swept down from the Antarctic Plateau , the shore party erected their hut and began preparations for the following summer 's sledging expeditions . The men readied clothing , sledges , tents and rations , conducted limited survey parties , and deployed several caches of supplies . The most notable of these depots was Aladdin 's Cave , excavated from the ice on the slope 5 @.@ 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) to the south of the main hut . 
 On 27 October 1912 Mawson outlined the summer sledging program . Of the seven sledging parties that would depart from Cape Denison , three would head east . The Eastern Coastal Party , led by the geologist Cecil Madigan , was charged with exploring beyond the Mertz Glacier tongue ; they would initially be supported by the Near Eastern Party led by Frank Stillwell , which would then turn to mapping the area between Cape Denison and the glacier . 
 The final party , led by Mawson , would push rapidly inland to the south of the Coastal Party towards Victoria Land , an area he had explored during Ernest Shackleton 's British Antarctic Expedition in 1908 – 09 . He hoped to travel about 500 miles ( 800 km ) east , collecting geological data and specimens , mapping the coast , and claiming territory for the crown . 
 Assisting him on this Far Eastern Party would be Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis , a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers , and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz . They were in charge of the expedition 's sledge dogs — Greenland Huskies — who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended . Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey , sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges . Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913 , to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice . 
 = = Journey eastwards = = 
 Blizzards prevented the parties from leaving Cape Denison until 10 November 1912 , four days after the scheduled start date . In his diary , Mertz recorded the clearing weather as " definitely a good omen " . Mawson wrote a short letter to his fiancée , Paquita <unk> : 
 The weather is fine this morning though the wind still blows . We shall get away in an hour 's time . I have two good companions , Dr Mertz and Lieut . Ninnis . It is unlikely that any harm will happen to us , but should I not return to you in Australia , please know that I truly loved you . I must be closing now as the others are waiting . 
 Allowing Madigan and Stillwell 's parties a head @-@ start , Mawson , Ninnis , Mertz and the seventeen dogs left Cape Denison early in the afternoon , reaching Aladdin 's Cave four hours later . Stopping for the night , they took on extra supplies and rearranged the sledges . The first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges , which collectively carried half the weight of the party 's supplies . The remaining supplies were put on the third sledge , towed by the second dog team . 
 Heading south the following day to avoid crevasses to the east , they travelled about 8 miles ( 13 km ) before poor weather forced them to stop and camp . Strong winds confined them to the tent until 13 November , and they were able to travel just a short distance before the weather picked up again . For three more days they remained in their tent , unable even to light the stove . When the weather cleared on 16 November , Madigan and Stillwell 's parties joined them . The three parties travelled together for much of the following day , before Mawson 's party separated and pushed on ahead in the late afternoon . 
 = = = Mertz and Ninnis Glaciers = = = 
 Heading south @-@ east towards the Mertz Glacier , with Mertz skiing ahead and Mawson and Ninnis driving the dogs , the party covered 15 miles ( 24 km ) on 18 November . This was despite encountering <unk> — ridges in the ice caused by wind — as high as 3 feet ( 91 cm ) , that caused the dogs to slip and the sledges to roll . During the day they passed two peaks , which Mawson named Madigan <unk> and Aurora Peak , after the leader of the Eastern Coastal Party and the expedition 's ship . The following day they began the steep descent to the Mertz Glacier . After the sledges several times overtook the dogs , the <unk> were allowed to run free down the slope . 
 Following a particularly steep descent the following day , half of Mawson 's team of dogs — reattached to his sledges — were almost lost when they fell into a crevasse . They were hauled out , but Mawson decided to camp when one of the dogs , Ginger Bitch , gave birth to the first in a litter of fourteen pups . 
 Over the next several days , the party continued across the glacier . They developed a method of crossing the many crevasses ; the forerunner , on skis , would cross the snow covering the hole ( the lid ) , and once across the first of the two dog teams would follow . Only after the first dog team was across would the second follow , " otherwise " , wrote Mawson , " the dogs in the rear would make a course direct for wherever the front dogs happened to be , cutting across corners and probably dragging their sledge sideways into a crevasse " . But despite their precautions Ninnis fell down and was rescued from three crevasses , once when they found they had pitched their tent on its lip . 
 After Mawson slipped into a crevasse , they began to tie themselves to their sledges as a precaution . Ninnis developed <unk> ( snow @-@ blindness ) , which Mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride . They were also losing dogs ; one broke his leg and was shot , another fell ill , and a third was lost down a crevasse . On 24 November , the party reached the eastern side of the glacier and ascended to the plateau . 
 On level ground again , they began to make quick progress . They awoke on the morning of 27 November to find another glacier ( later known as the Ninnis Glacier ) far larger than the first . As with the first glacier , they had to <unk> the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent . Once at the bottom of the glacier they spent four days crossing fields of crevasses , battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult . 
 In the harsh conditions , the dogs began to grow restless ; one of them , Shackleton , tore open the men 's food bag and devoured a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 1 kg ) pack of butter , crucial for their nourishment to supplement the <unk> . On 30 November , the party reached the eastern limit of the glacier and began the ascent to the plateau beyond , only to find themselves confronted at the top by <unk> so sharp @-@ edged the dogs were useless . Worse still , temperatures rose to 1 ° C ( 34 ° F ) , melting the snow and making pulling difficult ; the party switched to travelling at night to avoid the worst of the conditions . 
 From atop the ridge on the eastern side of the Ninnis Glacier , Mawson began to doubt the accuracy of the reports of land to the east by Charles Wilkes during the 1838 – 42 United States Exploring Expedition . By Wilkes ' reckoning , Mawson recorded in his diary , " We now appear to be off the real continent edge . " Concerned about overlap with Madigan 's party to the north , he turned his party south . They made good progress initially , but beginning on 6 December a blizzard confined them to their tent for three days . On 9 December , they set off again , but Ninnis was struggling . He had developed neuralgia on the left side of his face and a whitlow on one of his fingers . The latter was making sleep difficult for him , and on 13 December Mawson lanced the finger . 
 = = = Death of Ninnis = = = 
 On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges . The rear @-@ most sledge , which had carried the most weight , was well @-@ worn , and they decided to abandon it . The remaining supplies were re @-@ distributed between the remaining two sledges . Most of the important supplies — the tent and most of the food — were stored on the new rear sledge ; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse , they reasoned , it would be the front , less @-@ vital sledge . As the rear sledge was heavier , the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it . At the camp they left a small amount of supplies , including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover , without the floor or poles . 
 By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles ( 501 km ) from the Cape Denison hut . Mertz was ahead on skis , breaking trail . Mawson sat on the first sledge ; Ninnis walked beside the second . In his diary that night , Mertz recounted : 
 Around 1 pm , I crossed a crevasse , similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks . I cried out " crevasse ! " , moved at right angle , and went forward . Around five minutes later , I looked behind . Mawson was following , looking at his sledge in front of him . I couldn 't see Ninnis , so I stopped to have a better look . Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me . He immediately jumped out of his sledge , and rushed back . When he nodded his head , I followed him , driving back his sledge . 
 Ninnis , his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) wide with straight , ice walls . On a ledge deep in the hole , Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs — one still alive , but seriously injured — and the remains of Ninnis ' sledge . There was no sign of their companion . They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet ( 46 m ) , too far for their ropes to reach . " Dog ceased to moan shortly " , wrote Mawson in his diary that night . " We called and sounded for three hours , then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations . Came back , called & sounded for an hour . Read the burial service . " 
 = = Return = = 
 Along with the heavy @-@ weather tent , most of their own food and all of the dogs ' food , they had lost the pickaxe , the shovel , and Mertz 's waterproof <unk> and helmet . On Mawson 's sledge they had their stove , fuel , sleeping bags , and ten days ' worth of food . Their best immediate hope was to reach the camp of two days earlier where they had left the abandoned sledge and supplies , 15 miles ( 24 km ) west . They reached it in five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ hours , where Mertz used the tent cover , with the runners from the abandoned sledge and a ski as poles , to erect a shelter . 
 They were faced with two possible routes back to Cape Denison . The first option was to make for the coast , where they could supplement their meagre supplies with seal meat , and hope to meet with Madigan 's party ; that would considerably lengthen the journey , and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on . Or , pushing slightly to the south of their outward route , they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed . Mawson chose the inland route , which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs . The first dog — George — was killed the following morning , and of his meat some was fried for the men and the rest fed to the now starving dogs . " On the whole it was voted good " wrote Mawson of the meat , " though it had a strong , musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed " . 
 Before setting off again they raised the flag — which they had forgotten to do at their furthest point — and claimed the land for the crown . With the temperature rising , they switched to travelling at night to take advantage of the harder surface the cold provided . With the five remaining dogs , Mawson and Mertz pushed on . Starving , the dogs began to struggle ; two more — Johnson and Mary — were shot and divided between men and dogs over the following days . Mawson and Mertz found most of the meat tough , but enjoyed the liver ; it , at least , was tender . With the pulling power of the dogs now severely depleted , Mertz stopped making trail and instead helped Mawson to pull the sledge . Despite the challenges , they made good progress ; in the first four nights they travelled 60 miles ( 97 km ) . As they approached the Ninnis Glacier on 21 December , Haldane — once the largest and strongest of the dogs — was shot . 
 = = = Death of Mertz = = = 
 Both men were suffering , but Mertz in particular started to feel ill . He complained of stomach pains , and this began to slow them down . Pavlova was killed , leaving only one remaining dog . Mawson decided to lighten their sledge , and much of the equipment — including the camera , photographic films , and all of the scientific equipment save the theodolite — was abandoned . On 29 December , the day they cleared the Ninnis Glacier , the last dog was killed . Mawson recorded : " Had a great breakfast off Ginger 's skull — <unk> and brain " . Two days later Mawson recorded that Mertz was " off colour " ; Mertz wrote that he was " really tired [ and ] shall write no more " . 
 They made 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) on 31 December , no progress for the following two days , and 5 miles more on 3 January . " [ The ] cold wind frost @-@ bit Mertz 's fingers " recorded Mawson , " and he is generally in a very bad condition . Skin coming off legs , etc — so had to camp though going was good . " Not until 6 January did they make any more progress ; they went 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) before Mertz collapsed . The following day Mawson placed Mertz onto the sledge in his sleeping bag and continued , but was forced to stop and camp when Mertz 's condition again deteriorated . Mawson recorded : 
 He is very weak , becomes more and more delirious , rarely being able to speak coherently . He will eat or drink nothing . At 8 pm he raves & breaks a tent pole . Continues to rave & call ' Oh Veh , Oh Veh ' [ O weh ! , ' Oh dear ! ' ] for hours . I hold him down , then he becomes more peaceful & I put him quietly in the bag . He dies peacefully at about 2 am on morning of 8th . 
 Strong winds prevented Mawson from continuing for two days . Instead , he prepared for travelling alone , removing the rearmost half from the sledge , and rearranging its cargo . To save having to carry excess kerosene for the stove , he boiled the remainder of the dog meat . Dragging Mertz 's body in the sleeping bag from the tent , Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it , and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross , which he placed on the top . The following day he read the burial service . 
 = = = Alone = = = 
 As the weather cleared on 11 January , Mawson continued west , estimating the distance back to Cape Denison at 100 miles ( 160 km ) . He travelled 2 miles before pain in his feet forced him to stop ; he found that the soles of his feet had separated as a complete layer . Applying lanolin to his feet and wrapping them in several pairs of socks under his boots , he continued . " My whole body is apparently rotting from lack of nourishment " he recorded , " frost @-@ bitten fingertips festering , mucous membrane of nose gone , saliva glands of mouth refusing duty , skin coming off whole body " . Averaging around 5 miles a day , he began to cross the Mertz Glacier . On 17 January he broke through the lid of a crevasse , but the rope around his waist held him to the sledge and halted his fall . 
 I had time to say to myself " So this is the end " [ Mawson recorded ] , expecting every moment the sledge to crash on my head and both of us to go to the bottom unseen below . Then I thought of the food left uneaten in the sledge — and , as the sledge stopped without coming down , I thought of Providence again giving me a chance . The chance looked very small as the rope had sawed into the overhanging lid , my finger ends all damaged , myself weak ... With the feeling that Providence was helping me I made a great struggle , half getting out , then slipping back again several times , but at last just did it . Then I felt grateful to Providence ... who has so many times already helped me . 
 To save himself from future crevasses , Mawson constructed a rope ladder , which he carried over his shoulder and was attached to the sledge . It paid off almost immediately , and twice in the following days it allowed him to climb from crevasses . Once out of the Mertz Glacier his mileage increased , and on 28 January Madigan <unk> came into view . The following day , after travelling 5 miles , a cairn covered with black cloth appeared about 300 yards ( 270 m ) to his right . In it he found food and a note from Archibald Lang McLean , who along with Frank Hurley and Alfred <unk> had been sent out by Aurora 's captain John King Davis to search for the Far Eastern Party . 
 From the note , Mawson learned he was 21 miles ( 34 km ) south @-@ east of Aladdin 's Cave , and near two further food depots . The note also reported on the other parties of the expedition — all had returned to the hut safely — and on Roald Amundsen 's attainment of the South Pole in December 1911 . The cairn had been left there just six hours before , when the three men had returned to the hut . Struggling on his injured feet and lacking crampons ( he had thrown his away after he crossed the Mertz Glacier ) , Mawson took three days to reach Aladdin 's Cave . 
 Although supplies had been left in Aladdin 's Cave — including fresh fruit — there were not the spare crampons he had expected . Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut , and so he began to fashion his own , collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases . Even when completed , a blizzard confined him to the cave , and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent . Nearing the hut , he was spotted by three men working outside , who rushed up the hill to meet him . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Aurora arrived at Cape Denison on 13 January 1913 . When Mawson 's party failed to return , Davis sailed her east along the coast as far as the Mertz Glacier tongue , searching for the party . Finding no sign and reaching the end of the navigable ice @-@ free water , they returned to Cape Denison . The oncoming winter concerned Davis , and on 8 February — just hours before Mawson 's return to the hut — the ship departed Commonwealth Bay , leaving six men behind as a relief party . Upon Mawson 's return , the Aurora was recalled by wireless radio , but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship 's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men . 
 The Aurora returned to Cape Denison the following summer , in mid @-@ December , to take the men home . The delay may have saved Mawson 's life ; he later told Phillip Law , then @-@ director of Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions ( <unk> ) , that he did not believe he could have survived the sea journey so soon after his ordeal . 
 The cause of Mawson and Mertz 's illnesses remains in part a mystery . At the time , McLean — the expedition 's chief surgeon and one of the men who had remained at Cape Denison — attributed their sickness to colitis ; Mawson wrote in The Home of the Blizzard , his official account of the expedition , that Mertz died of fever and appendicitis . A 1969 study by Sir John Cleland and R. V. Southcott of the University of Adelaide concluded that the symptoms Mawson described — hair , skin and weight loss , depression , dysentery and persistent skin infections — indicated the men had suffered hypervitaminosis A , an excessive intake of vitamin A. This is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland Huskies , of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts . 
 While hypervitaminosis A is the generally accepted medical diagnosis for Mertz 's death and Mawson 's illness , the theory has its detractors . Law believed it was " completely unproven ... The symptoms that were described are exactly the ones you get from cold exposure . You don 't have to predicate a theory of this sort to explain the soles coming off your feet . " A 2005 article in The Medical Journal of Australia by Denise Carrington @-@ Smith suggested it may have been " the psychological stresses related to the death of a close friend and the deaths of the dogs he had cared for " , and a switch from a predominately vegetarian diet that killed Mertz , not hypervitaminosis A. 
 Suggestions of cannibalism — that Mawson may have eaten Mertz after his death — surfaced during Mawson 's lecture tour of the United States following the expedition . Several reports in American newspapers quoted Mawson as saying he considered eating Mertz , but these claims were denied by Mawson , who labelled them " outrageous " and an " invention " . Mawson 's biographers believe the suggestion of cannibalism is probably wrong ; Beau Riffenburgh notes that Mawson nursed Mertz for days , even at the possible risk to his own life . Moreover , he notes , Mawson had no way of knowing why Mertz died ; eating his flesh could possibly have been very dangerous . These sentiments are echoed by Philip Ayres , who also notes that with Mertz 's death Mawson had sufficient rations without having to resort to cannibalism . Law , who knew Mawson well , believed " He was a man of very solid , conservative morals . It would have been impossible for him to have considered it . " 
 In November 1913 , shortly before the Aurora arrived to return them to Australia , the men remaining at Cape Denison erected a memorial cross for Mertz and Ninnis on Azimuth Hill to the north @-@ west of the main hut . The cross , constructed from pieces of a broken radio mast , was accompanied by a plaque cut from wood from Mertz 's bunk . The cross still stands , although the crossbar has required reattaching several times , and the plaque was replaced with a replica in 1986 . The two glaciers the Far Eastern Party crossed — previously unnamed — were named by Mawson for Mertz and Ninnis . At a celebration in the centre of Adelaide on his return from Antarctica , Mawson praised his dead companions : " The survivors might have an opportunity of doing something more , but these men had done their all " . 
 Mawson 's return was celebrated at the Adelaide Town Hall , in an event attended by the Governor @-@ General , Lord Denman . A typical speaker stated that " Mawson has returned from a journey that was absolutely unparalleled in the history of exploration — one of the greatest illustrations of how the sternest affairs of Nature were overcome by the superb courage , power and resolve of man " . Including the Far Eastern Party , sledging parties from the Cape Denison base covered over 2 @,@ 600 miles ( 4 @,@ 200 km ) of previously unexplored land ; the expedition 's Western Base Party on the Shackleton Ice Shelf , under Frank Wild , covered a further 800 miles ( 1 @,@ 300 km ) . 
 The expedition was the first to use wireless radio in the Antarctic — transmitting back to Australia via a relay station established on Macquarie Island — and made several important scientific discoveries . First published in 1915 , Mawson 's account of the expedition , The Home of the Blizzard , devotes two chapters to the Far Eastern Party ; one contemporary reviewer commented that " undoubtedly to the general public the interest of the book centres in [ this ] moving account " . 
 A later analysis by J. Gordon Hayes , while commending most of the expedition , was critical of Mawson 's decision not to use skis , but Fred Jacka , writing in the Australian Dictionary of Biography , suggests that " for Mawson and Ninnis , who were manoeuvring heavy sledges , this would have been difficult much of the time " . In his 1976 foreword to Lennard Bickel 's book on the Australasian Antarctic Expedition , explorer and mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary described Mawson 's journey as " probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration " . 
 = USS Louisiana ( BB @-@ 19 ) = 
 USS Louisiana ( BB @-@ 19 ) was a Connecticut @-@ class battleship of the United States Navy . She was the second member of the class of six pre @-@ dreadnought battleships , and the third ship to carry her name . Louisiana was laid down in February 1903 , launched in August 1904 , and commissioned in June 1906 . She was a 16 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 16 @,@ 000 t ) battleship capable of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . Her main armament consisted of four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns supported by a mixed secondary battery of 7 in ( 178 mm ) and 8 in ( 203 mm ) guns . 
 Louisiana primarily operated along the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean during her career . In 1908 – 09 , she took part in the world cruise of the Great White Fleet . A pair of trips to European waters took place in 1910 and 1911 . From 1913 , she began to become involved in the Mexican Revolution , as the US Navy began to send ships to protect American interests in the country . This activity culminated in the US occupation of Veracruz in April 1914 . During World War I , Louisiana was employed as a training ship before serving as a convoy escort in late 1918 . After the war ended that year , she was used to ferry American soldiers back from France . With this work completed , she was decommissioned in October 1920 and broken up for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1923 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Louisiana was 456 @.@ 3 ft ( 139 @.@ 1 m ) long overall and had a beam of 76 @.@ 9 ft ( 23 @.@ 4 m ) and a draft of 24 @.@ 5 ft ( 7 @.@ 5 m ) . She displaced 16 @,@ 000 long tons ( 16 @,@ 000 t ) as designed and up to 17 @,@ 666 long tons ( 17 @,@ 949 t ) at full load . The ship was powered by two @-@ shaft triple @-@ expansion steam engines rated at 16 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 300 kW ) and twelve coal @-@ fired Babcock & Wilcox boilers , generating a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . As built , she was fitted with heavy military masts , but these were quickly replaced by lattice masts in 1909 . She had a crew of 827 officers and enlisted men , though this increased to 881 and later to 896 . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch / 45 Mark 5 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline , one forward and aft . The secondary battery consisted of eight 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) / 45 guns and twelve 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) / 45 guns . The 8 @-@ inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets amidships and the 7 @-@ inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull . For close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats , she carried twenty 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) / 50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3 @-@ pounder guns . She also carried four 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) 1 @-@ pounder guns . As was standard for capital ships of the period , Louisiana carried four 21 in ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes , submerged in her hull on the broadside . 
 Louisiana 's main armored belt was 11 in ( 279 mm ) thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and 6 in ( 152 mm ) elsewhere . The main battery gun turrets had 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) thick faces , and the supporting barbettes had the 10 in ( 250 mm ) of armor plating . The secondary turrets had 7 in ( 180 mm ) of frontal armor . The conning tower had 9 in ( 230 mm ) thick sides .

 The keel for Louisiana was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company in Newport News , Virginia on 7 February 1903 . Her completed hull was launched on 27 August 1904 , and she was commissioned into the fleet on 2 June 1906 . The ship then conducted a shakedown cruise off the coast of New England before being ordered to Cuba . She left the United States on 15 September with Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Assistant Secretary of State Robert Bacon aboard ; they were requested as a peace commission by Cuban President Tomás Estrada Palma to suppress an insurrection in the country . Taft and Bacon helped to create a provisional government , during which time Louisiana remained in Cuba . After their work was completed , Taft and Bacon returned to the ship , which took them back to Fortress Monroe , Virginia . 
 On 8 November , Louisiana carried President Theodore Roosevelt from Piney Point , Maryland to Panama , where the Panama Canal was being built . After inspecting the progress of construction , Roosevelt boarded Louisiana and made a visit to Puerto Rico to examine the new government building there before continuing on to Piney Point , arriving on 26 November . Over the course of the following year , the ship made a series of cruises to American ports , including New Orleans and Norfolk , and visits to Havana and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba . During this period , she also took part in training exercises off New England . 
 Louisiana joined the Great White Fleet on 16 December 1907 , when they departed Hampton Roads to begin their circumnavigation of the globe . The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America , making stops in Port of Spain , Rio de Janeiro , Punta Arenas , and Valparaíso , among other cities . After arriving in Mexico in March 1908 , the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice . The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas , stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia , stopping in Hawaii on the way . Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne , Sydney , and Auckland . 
 After leaving Australia , the fleet turned north for the Philippines , stopping in Manila , before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama . Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November . The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean ; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said , Egypt . The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar , where an international fleet of British , Russian , French , and Dutch warships greeted the Americans . The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 , having traveled 46 @,@ 729 nautical miles ( 86 @,@ 542 km ; 53 @,@ 775 mi ) . There , they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt . 
 Louisiana underwent an extensive overhaul after returning from the voyage , after which she conducted training maneuvers in the Atlantic . Captain Washington Irving Chambers took command of the ship on 1 June . On 1 November 1910 , she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the Atlantic Fleet , which crossed the Atlantic to visit British and French cities . A second trip to Europe followed in 1911 , this time to the Baltic Sea . There , the ships stopped in Copenhagen , Denmark , <unk> , Sweden , Kronstadt , Russia , and Kiel , Germany . They were inspected by the monarchs of each country . The worsening unrest of the Mexican Revolution led the United States to begin intervening in the conflict to protect American interests ; in support of these interventions , Louisiana made three trips to Mexico between July 1913 and September 1915 . The first lasted from 6 July to 29 December 1913 . The second , from 14 April to 8 August 1914 , supported the United States occupation of Veracruz . The third deployment lasted from 17 August to 24 September 1915 . 
 After returning from the last operation , Louisiana was reduced to reserve status at Norfolk and employed as a training ship for midshipmen and naval militia units . Following the United States ' declaration of war on Germany on 6 April 1917 , Louisiana was used to train gunners and engine room personnel . During this period , she was involved in a gunnery accident . During training on 1 June 1918 , the crews for three of the 7 @-@ inch guns aboard the battleship New Hampshire accidentally began firing at one of the submarine chasers present ; they fired several salvos before they received the order to cease fire . One of the shells struck Louisiana , killing one man and wounding several more . The ship was thereafter used to examine one of Arthur Pollen 's Argo Clocks , a fire control system that incorporated the first mechanical analog computer . The system was installed starting on 19 June , with work being completed by 1 July . 
 In September 1918 , she was reassigned as a convoy escort ; her first operation covered a convoy to Halifax on the 25th of the month . This duty did not last long , as the Germans signed the Armistice that ended the war on 11 November . Louisiana was then used to transport American soldiers back from France , starting on 24 December . The first trip was made in company with New Hampshire , and arrived in Brest , France on 5 January 1919 . Between the two of them , they carried 2 @,@ 169 men back to the United States . She made three additional trips to Brest in this role . After this task ended , she was transferred to the Philadelphia Navy Yard , where she was decommissioned on 20 October 1920 . The ship was eventually sold for scrap on 1 November 1923 . 
 = Hurricane Roslyn ( 1986 ) = 
 Hurricane Roslyn was the strongest hurricane in the 1986 Pacific hurricane season . The 17th and final named storm of the season , Roslyn developed on October 15 to the south of Mexico . Its movement was initially guided by a ridge to its north , and it became a tropical storm on October 16 and a hurricane a day later . The hurricane reached peak winds of 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) on October 19 before weakening and turning to the northeast . Roslyn ultimately moved ashore near Mazatlán , Sinaloa as a minimal hurricane , where it caused minimal damage due to the light population affected . It rapidly dissipated , although the remnants brought precipitation to Texas and other portions of the central and southern United States . There were no fatalities , and reported damage was minor .

 The final named storm of the season originated from a tropical disturbance that crossed Nicaragua into the eastern Pacific Ocean . With warm waters and increasing cyclonic organization , it developed into Tropical Depression Twenty @-@ Four on October 15 offshore Guatemala . The system moved quickly west @-@ northwestward under the influence of a ridge over Mexico . Quickly intensifying , the depression attained tropical storm status early on October 16 ; it was given the name Roslyn by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center . An eye became visible on satellite imagery , and by October 17 the storm reached hurricane status , while located about 400 miles ( 640 km ) south of Acapulco , Guerrero . 
 As water temperatures remained very warm along its path , the hurricane was able to intensify quickly . Roslyn reached peak winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) 48 hours after attaining hurricane status , while located about 550 miles ( 890 km ) southwest of Manzanillo , Colima ; that made it the strongest hurricane of the season . Roslyn maintained peak intensity for about 18 hours , during which it turned more to the northwest in response to a powerful advancing cold front . On October 20 , the hurricane curved northeastward as steady weakening ensued . After bypassing southeast of the Baja California Peninsula , Hurricane Roslyn moved ashore on October 22 at Mazatlán , Sinaloa with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . The low @-@ level center rapidly dissipated , although the upper @-@ level circulation continued northeastward along the advancing cold front . A frontal low developed in the western Gulf of Mexico , which moved over southeastern Texas and later through the Mississippi Valley . The original upper @-@ level circulation maintained its northeast movement , bringing rainfall to the southeastern United States . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Prior to the hurricane 's landfall in Mexico , officials in Mazatlán executed the evacuation of over 2 @,@ 000 people in vulnerable coastal areas ; such preparations prevented any deaths or injuries . Additionally , the owners of fishing vessels were advised to secure their properties by moving them to a safer area . As a result , only one yacht was sunk during the hurricane , and no major damage was reported by the fishing industry . Prior to moving ashore , Roslyn dropped light rainfall in extreme southern Baja California Sur . On the mainland , precipitation extended to the southeast and northwest of where the hurricane moved ashore ; the peak total was 13 @.@ 11 inches ( 33 @.@ 30 cm ) to the southeast of Mazatlán . The brunt of the storm missed Mazatlán , instead affecting a sparsely @-@ populated area . The highest reported winds from a land station were 44 mph ( 71 km / h ) , with gusts to 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Roslyn produced some flooding , but no serious damage . Impact was limited to flooded homes and factories , as well as some crop damage and beach erosion . 
 The remnants of Hurricane Roslyn produced heavy rainfall across the central and southern United States . In Matagorda , Texas , a total of 13 @.@ 8 inches ( 35 @.@ 05 cm ) was reported , which was the highest rainfall total anywhere along Roslyn 's path . The system dropped upwards of 5 inches ( 12 @.@ 70 cm ) in isolated locations of Alabama , Arkansas , Alabama , Georgia , and the Carolinas . The outskirts of the remnants of Roslyn brought rainfall to areas still recovering from significant flooding , partially caused by the earlier Hurricane Paine . Clouds from Roslyn began affecting the southern United States a day before it made its original landfall . The storm prompted flash flood watches in southeastern Texas , and the resulting rainfall flooded roadways and streams . 
 = Mercury ( element ) = 
 Mercury is a chemical element with symbol Hg and atomic number 80 . It is commonly known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum ( / <unk> / ) . A heavy , silvery d @-@ block element , mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure ; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is bromine , though metals such as caesium , gallium , and rubidium melt just above room temperature . 
 Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar ( mercuric sulfide ) . The red pigment vermilion is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide . 
 Mercury is used in thermometers , barometers , <unk> , sphygmomanometers , float valves , mercury switches , mercury relays , fluorescent lamps and other devices , though concerns about the element 's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan @-@ filled glass thermometers and <unk> or infrared @-@ based electronic instruments . Likewise , mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers . Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales . It is used in fluorescent lighting . Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short @-@ wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce , making visible light . 
 Mercury poisoning can result from exposure to water @-@ soluble forms of mercury ( such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury ) , by inhalation of mercury vapor , or by ingesting any form of mercury .

 Mercury is a heavy , silvery @-@ white liquid metal . Compared to other metals , it is a poor conductor of heat , but a fair conductor of electricity . 
 It has a freezing point of − 38 @.@ 83 ° C and a boiling point of 356 @.@ 73 ° C , both exceptionally low for a metal . In addition , mercury 's boiling point of 629 @.@ 88 K ( 356 @.@ 73 ° C ) is the lowest of any metal . Upon freezing , the volume of mercury decreases by 3 @.@ 59 % and its density changes from 13 @.@ 69 g / cm3 when liquid to 14 @.@ 184 g / cm3 when solid . The coefficient of volume expansion is 181 @.@ 59 × 10 − 6 at 0 ° C , 181 @.@ 71 × 10 − 6 at 20 ° C and 182 @.@ 50 × 10 − 6 at 100 ° C ( per ° C ) . Solid mercury is malleable and ductile and can be cut with a knife . 
 A complete explanation of mercury 's extreme volatility delves deep into the realm of quantum physics , but it can be summarized as follows : mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s , 2s , 2p , 3s , 3p , 3d , 4s , 4p , 4d , 4f , 5s , 5p , 5d , and 6s subshells . Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron , mercury behaves similarly to noble gases , which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures . 
 The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell . An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus ( see lanthanide contraction ) . The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc , although both these metals still melt easily and , in addition , have unusually low boiling points .

 Mercury does not react with most acids , such as dilute sulfuric acid , although oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate , nitrate , and chloride . Like silver , mercury reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide . Mercury reacts with solid sulfur flakes , which are used in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury ( spill kits also use activated carbon and powdered zinc ) .

 Mercury dissolves many other metals such as gold and silver to form amalgams . Iron is an exception , and iron flasks have traditionally been used to trade mercury . Several other first row transition metals with the exception of manganese , copper and zinc are reluctant to form amalgams . Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum . Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis , and is also used in high @-@ pressure sodium lamps . 
 Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury @-@ aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact . Since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in @-@ depth ( as in iron rusting ) , even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium . For this reason , mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft . 
 Mercury embrittlement is the most common type of liquid metal embrittlement .

 = = Etymology = = 
 Hg is the modern chemical symbol for mercury . It comes from hydrargyrum , a Latinized form of the Greek word <unk> ( <unk> ) , which is a compound word meaning " water @-@ silver " ( from <unk> <unk> , the root of <unk> , " water , " and <unk> <unk> " silver " ) – since it is liquid like water and shiny like silver . The element was named after the Roman god Mercury , known for his speed and mobility . It is associated with the planet Mercury ; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal ; the Sanskrit word for alchemy is <unk> which means " the way of mercury " . Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name . 
 = = History = = 
 Mercury was found in Egyptian tombs that date from 1500 BC . 
 In China and Tibet , mercury use was thought to prolong life , heal fractures , and maintain generally good health , although it is now known that exposure to mercury vapor leads to serious adverse health effects . The first emperor of China , <unk> <unk> Huáng Dì — allegedly buried in a tomb — the " Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor " — that contained rivers of flowing mercury on a model of the land he ruled , representative of the rivers of China — was killed by drinking a mercury and powdered jade mixture formulated by Qin alchemists ( causing liver failure , mercury poisoning , and brain death ) who intended to give him eternal life . Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun , the second Tulunid ruler of Egypt ( r . 884 – 896 ) , known for his extravagance and profligacy , reportedly built a basin filled with mercury , on which he would lie on top of air @-@ filled cushions and be rocked to sleep . 
 In November 2014 " large quantities " of mercury were discovered in a chamber 60 feet below the 1800 @-@ year @-@ old pyramid known as the " Temple of the Feathered Serpent , " " the third largest pyramid of Teotihuacan , " Mexico along with " jade statues , jaguar remains , a box filled with carved shells and rubber balls . " 
 The ancient Greeks used mercury in ointments ; the ancient Egyptians and the Romans used it in cosmetics . In Lamanai , once a major city of the Maya civilization , a pool of mercury was found under a marker in a Mesoamerican ballcourt . By 500 BC mercury was used to make amalgams ( Medieval Latin <unk> , " alloy of mercury " ) with other metals . 
 Alchemists thought of mercury as the First Matter from which all metals were formed . They believed that different metals could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of sulfur contained within the mercury . The purest of these was gold , and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base ( or impure ) metals into gold , which was the goal of many alchemists . 
 The mines in Almadén ( Spain ) , Monte Amiata ( Italy ) , and Idrija ( now Slovenia ) dominated mercury production from the opening of the mine in Almadén 2500 years ago , until new deposits were found at the end of the 19th century . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 Mercury is an extremely rare element in Earth 's crust , having an average crustal abundance by mass of only 0 @.@ 08 parts per million ( ppm ) . Because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass , mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the element 's abundance in ordinary rock . The richest mercury ores contain up to 2 @.@ 5 % mercury by mass , and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0 @.@ 1 % mercury ( 12 @,@ 000 times average crustal abundance ) . It is found either as a native metal ( rare ) or in cinnabar , <unk> , <unk> and other minerals , with cinnabar ( HgS ) being the most common ore . Mercury ores usually occur in very young orogenic belts where rocks of high density are forced to the crust of Earth , often in hot springs or other volcanic regions . 
 Beginning in 1558 , with the invention of the patio process to extract silver from ore using mercury , mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies . Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in New Spain and Peru . Initially , the Spanish Crown 's mines in Almadén in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies . Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World , and more than 100 @,@ 000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of <unk> , Peru , over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563 . The patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century . 
 Former mines in Italy , the United States and Mexico , which once produced a large proportion of the world supply , have now been completely mined out or , in the case of Slovenia ( Idrija ) and Spain ( Almadén ) , shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury . Nevada 's <unk> Mine , the last mercury mine in the United States , closed in 1992 . The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $ 650 per 76 @-@ pound ( 34 @.@ 46 kg ) flask . 
 Mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor . The equation for this extraction is 
 HgS + O2 → Hg + SO2 
 In 2005 , China was the top producer of mercury with almost two @-@ thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan . Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents . 
 Because of the high toxicity of mercury , both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning . In China , prison labor was used by a private mining company as recently as the 1950s to create new cinnabar mines . Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi mining company to establish new tunnels . Worker health in functioning mines is at high risk . 
 The European Union directive calling for compact fluorescent bulbs to be made mandatory by 2012 has encouraged China to re @-@ open cinnabar mines to obtain the mercury required for CFL bulb manufacture . Environmental dangers have been a concern , particularly in the southern cities of Foshan and Guangzhou , and in Guizhou province in the southwest . 
 Abandoned mercury mine processing sites often contain very hazardous waste piles of roasted cinnabar <unk> . Water run @-@ off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage . Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re @-@ use . For example , in 1976 Santa Clara County , California purchased the historic <unk> Quicksilver Mine and created a county park on the site , after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property .

 Mercury exists in two main oxidation states , I and II . Higher oxidation states are rare ( e.g. , mercury ( IV ) fluoride , <unk> 
 4 ) , but have been detected under extraordinary conditions .

 Unlike its lighter neighbors , cadmium and zinc , mercury usually forms simple stable compounds with metal @-@ metal bonds . Most mercury ( I ) compounds are diamagnetic and feature the dimeric cation , Hg2 + 
 2 . Stable derivatives include the chloride and nitrate . Treatment of Hg ( I ) compounds complexation with strong ligands such as sulfide , cyanide , etc. induces disproportionation to Hg2 + and elemental mercury . Mercury ( I ) chloride , a colorless solid also known as calomel , is really the compound with the formula <unk> , with the connectivity Cl @-@ Hg @-@ Hg @-@ Cl . It is a standard in electrochemistry . It reacts with chlorine to give mercuric chloride , which resists further oxidation . Mercury ( I ) hydride , a colorless gas , has the formula <unk> , containing no Hg @-@ Hg bond . 
 Indicative of its tendency to bond to itself , mercury forms mercury <unk> , which consist of linear chains of mercury centers , capped with a positive charge . One example is Hg2 + 
 3 ( AsF − 
 6 ) 
 2 . 
 = = = Compounds of mercury ( II ) = = = 
 Mercury ( II ) is the most common oxidation state and is the main one in nature as well . All four mercuric halides are known . They form tetrahedral complexes with other ligands but the halides adopt linear coordination geometry , somewhat like Ag + does . Best known is mercury ( II ) chloride , an easily sublimating white solid . HgCl2 forms coordination complexes that are typically tetrahedral , e.g. HgCl2 − 
 4 . 
 Mercury ( II ) oxide , the main oxide of mercury , arises when the metal is exposed to air for long periods at elevated temperatures . It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400 ° C , as was demonstrated by Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen . Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized , as they are for its neighbors gold and silver . 
 Being a soft metal , mercury forms very stable derivatives with the heavier chalcogens . <unk> is mercury ( II ) sulfide , HgS , which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar and is the brilliant pigment <unk> . Like ZnS , HgS crystallizes in two forms , the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form . Mercury ( II ) selenide ( <unk> ) and mercury ( II ) telluride ( <unk> ) are also known , these as well as various derivatives , e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials . 
 Mercury ( II ) salts form a variety of complex derivatives with ammonia . These include Millon 's base ( <unk> + ) , the one @-@ dimensional polymer ( salts of <unk> + 
 2 ) 
 n ) , and " fusible white precipitate " or [ Hg ( NH3 ) 2 ] Cl2 . Known as Nessler 's reagent , potassium <unk> ( II ) ( <unk> − 
 4 ) is still occasionally used to test for ammonia owing to its tendency to form the deeply colored iodide salt of Millon 's base . 
 Mercury fulminate is a detonator widely used in explosives .
