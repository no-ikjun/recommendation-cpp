 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 2005 race by two lengths , while Cambridge led overall with 78 victories to Oxford 's 72 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . The race was sponsored by Xchanging for the second consecutive year , and was umpired by former Oxford Blue Simon Harris . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race .

 The Oxford crew , whose average age was 24 , comprised four Britons , two Canadians , two Americans and , in Bastien Ripoll , the first French rower to participate in the contest . Cambridge 's crew , with an average age of 26 , consisted of three Britons , three Germans , an Australian , an American and a Canadian .

 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station where they were afforded some shelter from the inclement conditions with strong winds creating choppy water . Under cloudy skies , Oxford took an early lead but Cambridge came back into contention and held a half @-@ a @-@ length lead at Harrods . As they crews passed under Hammersmith Bridge , " wind and waves engulfed the boats and both seemed to check " . Oxford drew level and their cox Seb Pearce called for a push ; his crew responded , moving away from Cambridge in the rough water . Extending their lead out to two lengths by the Bandstand , Oxford pulled further away winning by five lengths in a time of 18 minutes and 26 seconds . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie beat Oxford 's Isis . Earlier , Oxford won the 61st Women 's Boat Race by half @-@ a @-@ length in a time of 5 minutes 54 seconds .

 Cambridge coach Duncan Holland suggested " it 's pretty hard to row with a boat full of water " while his cox Rudge claimed " Oxford were a little bit sheltered and it made a big difference " .

 = Command & Conquer ( 1995 video game ) = 
 Command & Conquer , sometimes known as Command & Conquer : Tiberian Dawn , is a 1995 real @-@ time strategy video game developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Interactive . Set in an alternate history of modern day , the game tells the story of a world war between two globalized factions : the Global Defense Initiative of the United Nations and a cult @-@ like militant organization called the Brotherhood of Nod , led by the mysterious Kane . The groups compete for control of Tiberium , a mysterious substance that slowly spreads across the world . 
 Westwood first conceived Command & Conquer during the final stages of the development of Dune II , and it expands on ideas first explored in that title . Inspired by the events of the era , particularly the Gulf War , the team gave the game a modern warfare setting . The game contains live @-@ action full motion video cutscenes , which star Westwood employees and a single professional actor , Joseph D. Kucan , who plays Kane . 
 Command & Conquer was a commercial and critical success , selling over three million copies and winning numerous awards . It has been cited as the title that defined and popularized the real @-@ time strategy genre . The game was the first in the Command & Conquer series , which sold 30 million copies by 2009 . To mark the 12th anniversary of the franchise , Electronic Arts , the current publisher and owner of the series , released the game for free in 2007 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Command & Conquer requires the player to construct a base and to gather resources in order to fund the production of buildings , technologies , and combat units to attack and conquer an opponent 's base . The game contains two playable factions : the Global Defense Initiative ( GDI ) and the Brotherhood of Nod . GDI units are sturdy and powerful , but expensive . Meanwhile , Nod armies are made up of a mix of cheap and numerous units , mixed in with unusual units such as rocket bikes and stealth tanks . As a result , GDI focuses on large @-@ scale strategic attacks , while Nod creates bigger armies and uses unconventional tactics . There are roughly fifty units and structures in total . Tiberium , the game 's sole resource , is gathered by harvester units that carry it to a refinery structure for processing . When the player constructs buildings , additional units and structures become available for purchase . Command & Conquer features two single @-@ player campaigns , one each for the GDI and Nod factions . The objective of most campaign mission objectives is to destroy or take control of enemy buildings . The missions begin with live @-@ action full motion video ( FMV ) cutscenes . 
 The original DOS release features multiplayer with up to four players , a rarity at the time . Multiplayer over an Internet connection was added in Command & Conquer Gold , which also features SVGA visuals . The game 's Sega Saturn and PlayStation ports lack multiplayer support , but the latter release includes the fifteen single @-@ player missions from The Covert Operations expansion pack . The Nintendo 64 version features updated graphics , with 3D models and environments . The FMV cutscenes were removed and replaced with static images , accompanied by voice acting and sound effects . While the Nintendo 64 version includes four new " Special Ops " missions , it lacks multiplayer support . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Command & Conquer is set in an alternate timeline , after a meteorite crashed near the river Tiber in Italy in 1995 . The meteorite brings with it an extremely toxic alien substance called Tiberium , which becomes extremely valuable because of its ability to absorb and crystallize precious metals from the surrounding soil . An ancient , cultic secret society called the Brotherhood of Nod claims to have foreseen the potentials of this new substance , investing in the development of technology to harvest and refine Tiberium crystals ahead of the scientific community . Nod soon controls nearly half of the supply and uses these assets to sustain a rapidly growing army of followers worldwide . The group is led by a self @-@ proclaimed messianic figure known only as Kane . 
 Following a series of international terrorist bombings that culminate in the destruction of the fictional Grain Trade Center in Vienna - attacks which are quickly attributed to the Brotherhood of Nod - the United Nations Security Council realizes that Kane and Nod are commencing a global campaign of terrorism , and authorises the Global Defense Initiative to intervene on its behalf in 1999 , setting a conflict in motion that escalates into a world war . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Command & Conquer features two sub @-@ plots based on the two playable factions of the game . Commanding the Global Defense Initiative 's troops , the player becomes instrumental in eliminating Nod 's European forces . Under the command of General Mark Jamison Sheppard , the player completes missions that range from securing a beach , to rescuing civilians and scientists , to defending GDI bases from Nod assaults . Combat occurs in countries of Central and Eastern Europe . A major plot element is an international scandal caused by a Nod media manipulation , which convinces the world that the GDI deliberately attacked and massacred the Polish city of Białystok . This leads to a cut in GDI funding , forcing the player to play several missions with limited forces . Finally , the player besieges the Temple of Nod in Sarajevo , Bosnia , which Kane uses as his main base of operations . 
 As a new recruit in the Brotherhood of Nod , the player initially performs tasks for the Brotherhood 's second @-@ in @-@ command , a man known as Seth . After Seth attempts to deploy the player in an operation against the United States military without Kane 's approval , Kane kills him and thereafter issues commands to the player directly . The player 's goal is to drive GDI forces out of North Africa through the use of both conventional and unconventional warfare . In a ploy to secure victory for Nod , the player is assigned to gain control of GDI 's space @-@ based ion cannon , and to establish Nod 's Temple in South Africa . The campaign ends with the entire African continent under Nod 's control , and with the Brotherhood planning to achieve the same in Europe . The conclusion of the campaign allows the player to choose a historical landmark to destroy with GDI 's hijacked ion cannon , in order to shatter GDI 's public image . Potential targets include the White House , the British Houses of Parliament , the Eiffel Tower and the Brandenburg Gate . 
 = = Development = = 
 Westwood Studios began developing Command & Conquer in early 1993 , after conceiving the game near the end of Dune II 's development . The team sought to build on the foundation laid by their earlier game , and Westwood co @-@ founder Brett Sperry later said that " Command & Conquer was the net result of the Dune II wish list . " Following the success of Dune II , Sperry believed that " it was time to build the ultimate RTS " with an original intellectual property . He later said that he was " fanatical about calling the game ' Command & Conquer ' , " because he believed that the title was an ideal summary of the gameplay . 
 As with Dune II , Command & Conquer originally took place in a high fantasy world before being redesigned . The team changed to a modern warfare setting because of the political climate of the mid @-@ 1990s , and they later cited the Gulf War as a key influence in this decision . Westwood co @-@ founder Louis Castle said that " [ w ] ar was in the news and the threat of terrorism was on everyone 's mind " . The setting was further influenced by Sperry 's belief that future wars would not be " nation @-@ to @-@ nation " , but would rather be " fought between Western society and a kind of anarchistic terror organization that doesn 't have a centralized government . " The team sought to make the player feel like their computer was " a terminal to a real battlefield " , going so far as to make the installation process resemble hacking a " military infrastructure " . However , Castle noted that the team " created [ a parallel universe ] to avoid dealing with the sobering issues of a real war . " 
 In a retrospective , Paul Mallinson of Computer & Video Games ( CVG ) wrote that the game 's production was " speedy , focused and fun " . Castle said that , because the company was creating other titles at the time , development of Command & Conquer was not a " working party " ; but lead programmer Joe Bostic later said that it was " so much fun that I would sometimes marvel that I actually got paid as well . " The game 's playtesters were enthusiastic about the game during development , which Castle later said had encouraged the team to work harder . The team created live @-@ action FMV cutscenes for the game . These cutscenes contain no professional actors aside from Kucan , who played Kane and was heavily involved in their production . The cast is made up of Westwood team members , and a low budget meant that filming took place in " spare rooms " and warehouses . Castle later said that the team " had no illusions that we were as good as TV or film , " but that the cutscenes were not intentionally campy . He credited Kucan with " taking ragtag group of people who had no business in front of a camera and making something reasonably good . " To replace the spice from Dune II , the team introduced Tiberium , which was inspired by the 1957 B @-@ movie The Monolith Monsters . Castle said that the team 's goal in both cases was to create " a central resource that everybody was fighting over . " As with Dune II , the soundtrack was composed by Frank Klepacki . 
 To create the game 's landscapes , the artists took digitized photographs of real world terrain and manipulated them with rendering techniques .

 The game was released for DOS in 1995 . In 1996 , the game received a Windows 95 re @-@ release titled Command & Conquer : Gold ( also known as C & C 95 ) , featuring SVGA visuals . A port for the Macintosh was released in 1996 , with the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions following in 1996 – 97 , and the Nintendo 64 version arriving on June 29 , 1999 . Due to a deal between Virgin Interactive and Sega , the console version was a Saturn exclusive until 1997 . In 2007 , Command & Conquer was released as a free download by Electronic Arts . The game 's PlayStation version was later released on the PlayStation Network in Europe . 
 In 1996 , Westwood released an expansion pack The Covert Operations , adding 15 new missions . A spin @-@ off game titled Command & Conquer : Sole Survivor focuses entirely on online multiplayer , putting the players in control of single units in modes such as deathmatch and capture the flag . 
 In 2008 , an unofficial patch was released to keep C & C working on both 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows XP and higher . The patch fixes several bugs in the game , and adds upgrades like higher resolution and support for language packs .

 Command & Conquer was a commercial success , selling over three million copies . Critical reception was highly positive . In 1998 , Command & Conquer Gold was nominated at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences ' first annual Interactive Achievement Awards in the category " Computer Strategy Game of the Year " . 
 Entertainment Weekly 's Bob Strauss offered the game effusive praise , writing : " If you liked playing with toy soldiers as a kid , you 'll think you 've stepped on a land mine and gone to heaven " . Strauss believed that its cutscenes , voice clips and " nonstop action " served to " [ enliven ] the usually stodgy war game genre " . After highlighting its multiplayer and citing its installation process as " the coolest [ ... ] I 've ever seen " , he concluded that the game " makes other war simulations look as flat as Risk . " Peter Smith of Computer Games Magazine called Command & Conquer " an adrenaline rush in a box " , writing : " Everything about this game shouts quality . " Smith lauded the game 's music and sound effects , gameplay and story , and even its install program . Smith noted some minor problems , citing issues with the game 's artificial intelligence , but finished by saying that " Westwood has really raised the bar with this one . " Chris Hudak of GameSpot wrote : " Starting from the load @-@ screens and straight on ' til morning , Command & Conquer is one of the finest , most brilliantly @-@ designed computer games I have ever seen .

 Martin E. <unk> of Computer Gaming World wrote that Command & Conquer " remains mainly a good , <unk> version of Dune II " . <unk> found the game 's interface intuitive and described its online component as " sophisticated and easy @-@ to @-@ use " , also praising its story for being " as interesting as the actual tactics and gunfire " , and commented that he " would buy C & C2 just to see where things are going to end up " . However , according to him , the developers failed " to correct major shortcomings " in Dune II , as its fog of war does not fit with the real @-@ world setting , also finding fault with design choices in the game 's missions , which he believed were structured like " puzzles " that allowed for only one way to win . Nevertheless , he concluded that it remained " the best @-@ looking and sounding strategy game yet " despite its flaws , and that it was " more than entertaining enough to make up for its shortcomings . " Writing for PC Gamer US , T. Liam McDonald wrote that the game " has all the playability of Dune II , but with more diverse units , more unusual scenarios , and impressively executed wraparound cutscenes . " McDonald called its combat a " satisfying blend of action and strategy " , and noted that this , combined with an attention to " little details " , made the game a " success " , also praising its cutscenes as " terrifically executed " . Although he was disappointed that the game lacked " fancier terrain or another zoom level " , McDonald concluded : " This game is a whole lot of fun , so get it , play it , and love it like your own child .

 Reviewing Command & Conquer 's Sega Saturn port , Next Generation commented that it did little to improve the core game , and noted its lower resolution and missing multiplayer functionality as significant negatives . However , the review still called it one of the console 's best games and a " must @-@ buy for Saturn owners " . CVG 's Kim Randell wrote that the Saturn version is " up there with AM2 's finest games " and " a joy to play " , as it " thrives on deceptively simple gameplay " despite its unimpressive graphics and sound , and adding that the later missions are " masterpieces of gaming design " . Randell believed that the port 's missing multiplayer mode would have made it as good as Virtua Fighter 2 and NiGHTS Into Dreams , but that it " isn 't far off this realm of excellence " without it . 
 Game Informer 's three reviewers praised the Saturn and PlayStation ports of Command & Conquer . While the magazine 's Andy McNamara wrote that " the best way to play C & C is on the PC " , he called the console version a " fantastic port " marred only by " rather clumsy " controls and the inability to save in the middle of a mission . Andrew Reiner agreed , calling it a " flawless PC port " that " perfectly " recreates the thrills of the original ; but he was displeased that it did not feature multiplayer support . Jon Storm summarized it as " an excellent addition to any PlayStation or Saturn library . " A reviewer for Next Generation wrote : " Just like the ported Saturn version , PSX [ PlayStation ] C & C adds little to the existing game . " The review 's author cited the lower resolution and lack of multiplayer as low points , but noted that the addition of the Covert Operations missions " adds to the overall replay value " . 
 Reviewing the Nintendo 64 version of Command & Conquer , Erik Reppen of Game Informer wrote that it " has done an amazing job of completely reworking the old levels into a 3D polygonal format . " Although he said that the game " offers plenty to keep you entertained " , he disliked the heavy sound compression and the loss of the FMV cutscenes present in earlier versions . IGN 's Aaron Boulding opened his review by saying : " To their credit , Looking Glass developed Command & Conquer with all of the elements you want from a quality RTS . " Boulding praised the gameplay and the Special Ops missions , but noted that most of the units were distinct from the PC version . He was less happy with the port 's graphics , calling them " hit and miss " , though he lauded the audio effects and voice work . Boulding also said the controls were well handled , though a bit complicated , and concluded : " Command & Conquer is a fine game and may get a little addictive for anyone who never got into the PC version of the game . But for anyone who ran through the old version , the N64 won 't offer much in the way of new thrills beyond the new N64 missions and the 3D world . " 
 Next Generation commented that , while earlier ports had trouble recreating the mouse controls of the original , the Nintendo 64 version " handles it beautifully " . The review 's author stated that the controller 's analog stick " allow [ s for ] the same simple point and click interface as the PC " , adding that " the entire interface is equally responsive and well planned . " The reviewer praised its graphics and audio , even calling the voice acting " the most competent [ ... ] ever to appear en masse on the platform " , but disliked its lack of multiplayer support , and concluded that the port " keeps the spirit of the game perfectly while adapting it wonderfully to the limitations of the N64 " . James <unk> of The Cincinnati Enquirer believed that advancements in the real @-@ time strategy genre rendered the Nintendo 64 port outdated , despite its new " bells and whistles " . However , <unk> wrote that those who had not played earlier Command & Conquer releases would find it " highly addictive " , adding that its " controls are surprisingly good for a PC port . "

 Command & Conquer spawned the Command & Conquer franchise , which sold 30 million copies in total by November 2009 . The story of the game continued in the Tiberian series , including an action title Command & Conquer : Renegade that revisits the original game 's First Tiberium War . In 1996 , Westwood launched the prequel series Red Alert , telling the story of a global conflict between the Western nations and the Soviet Union which took place instead of World War II . As its direct sequel is Command & Conquer : Tiberian Sun , the original Command & Conquer has since widely been referred to by fans as Tiberian Dawn , which also distinguishes itself from the series that it gave its name to . 
 The game has also been cited as a large influence on the real @-@ time strategy genre overall . In 1996 , Computer Gaming World ranked Command & Conquer as the 48th best game of all time , opining that despite being not " as complete a design as Warcraft II " , the game set " a new standard for great multiplayer play " . That same year , Next Generation ranked it as the 49th top game of all time for how " it brought war gaming out of prehistoric , hexagonal mire and made it cool " . CVG 's Mallinson wrote in 2002 that " hundreds of other strategy games " , from StarCraft to Age of Empires , had borrowed concepts from Command & Conquer and " the RTS genre is still thriving , and that is all thanks to Command & Conquer " . Bruce Geryk of GameSpot commented that " the name [ Command & Conquer ] is nearly synonymous with RTS gaming " ; and GameSpy 's Mark Walker wrote that " Warcraft and Dune II were little more than warm up acts " for Command & Conquer , which " blew open the genre " , and credited the title with popularizing real @-@ time strategy games in the years following its release . Dan Adams of IGN wrote that the game , alongside Warcraft : Orcs & Humans , " cemented the popularity " of the real @-@ time strategy genre in the wake of Dune II . Polish web portal Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the seventh most addictive game " that stole our childhood " .

 USS Texas ( BB @-@ 35 ) , the second ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the US state of Texas , is a New York @-@ class battleship . The ship was launched on 18 May 1912 and commissioned on 12 March 1914 . 
 Soon after her commissioning , Texas saw action in Mexican waters following the " Tampico Incident " and made numerous sorties into the North Sea during World War I. When the United States formally entered World War II in 1941 , Texas escorted war convoys across the Atlantic , and later shelled Axis @-@ held beaches for the North African campaign and the Normandy Landings before being transferred to the Pacific Theater late in 1944 to provide naval gunfire support during the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa . Texas was decommissioned in 1948 , having earned a total of five battle stars for service in World War II , and is now a museum ship near Houston , Texas . 
 Among the world 's remaining battleships , Texas is notable for being the only remaining WW I era dreadnought battleship , though she is not the oldest surviving battleship : Mikasa , a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship ordered in 1898 by the Empire of Japan , and HMS Victory , launched 1765 ( Nelson 's Flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar ) , are both older than Texas . She is also noteworthy for being one of only six remaining ships and the only remaining capital ship to have served in both World Wars . Among US @-@ built battleships , Texas is notable for her sizable number of firsts : the first US Navy vessel to house a permanently @-@ assigned contingent of US Marines , the first US battleship to mount anti @-@ aircraft guns , the first US ship to control gunfire with directors and range @-@ keepers ( analog forerunners of today 's computers ) , the first US battleship to launch an aircraft , from a platform on Turret 2 , one of the first to receive the CXAM @-@ 1 version of CXAM production radar in the US Navy , the first US battleship to become a permanent museum ship , and the first battleship declared to be a US National Historic Landmark .

She was launched on 18 May 1912 , sponsored by Miss Claudia Lyon , daughter of Colonel Cecil Lyon , Republican national committeeman from Texas . The ship was commissioned on 12 March 1914 with Captain Albert W. Grant in command . 
 Texas 's main battery consisted of ten 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) / 45 caliber Mark 1 guns , which could fire 1 @,@ 400 lb ( 635 kg ) armor @-@ piercing shells to a range of 13 mi ( 11 nmi ; 21 km ) . Her secondary battery consisted of twenty @-@ one 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 51 caliber guns . She also mounted four 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes for the Bliss @-@ Leavitt Mark 8 torpedo , 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern . The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total , plus 12 naval defense mines . Texas and her sister New York were the only battleships to store and hoist their 14 @-@ inch ammunition in cast @-@ iron cups , nose @-@ down .

 On 24 March 1914 , Texas departed Norfolk Navy Yard and set a course for New York City , making an overnight stop at Tompkinsville , New York on the night of 26 March . Entering New York Navy Yard on the next day , she spent the next three weeks there undergoing the installation of fire @-@ control equipment . 
 During her stay in New York , President Woodrow Wilson ordered a number of ships of the Atlantic Fleet to Mexican waters in response to tension created when a detail of Mexican federal troops detained an American gunboat crew at Tampico . The problem was quickly resolved locally , but Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo sought further redress by demanding an official disavowal of the act by the Huerta regime and a 21 @-@ gun salute to the American flag . 
 President Wilson saw in the incident an opportunity to put pressure on a government he felt was undemocratic . On 20 April , Wilson placed the matter before the United States Congress and sent orders to Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher , commanding the naval force off the Mexican coast , instructing him to land a force at Veracruz and to seize the customs house there in retaliation for what is now known as the " Tampico Incident " . That action was carried out on 21 – 22 April . 
 Due to the intensity of the situation , Texas put to sea on 13 May and headed directly to operational duty without benefit of the usual shakedown cruise and post @-@ shakedown repair period . After a five @-@ day stop at Hampton Roads from 14 – 19 May , she joined Rear Admiral Fletcher 's force off Veracruz on 26 May . She remained in Mexican waters for just over two months , supporting the American forces ashore . On 8 August , she left Veracruz and set a course for Nipe Bay , Cuba , and from there steamed to New York where she entered the Navy Yard on 21 August . 
 The battleship remained there until 6 September , when she returned to sea , joined the Atlantic Fleet , and settled into a schedule of normal fleet operations . In October , she returned to the Mexican coast . Later that month , Texas became station ship at Tuxpan , a duty that lasted until 4 November , when she steamed for Galveston , Texas . While at Galveston on 7 November , Texas Governor Oscar Colquitt presented the ship 's silver service to Captain Grant . The Young Men 's Business League of Waco , Texas , raised the $ 10 @,@ 000 to purchase the silver . 
 Texas sailed for Tampico on 14 November and thereafter to Veracruz , where she remained for a month . The ship left Mexico on 20 December and set a course for New York . The battleship entered New York Navy Yard on 28 December and remained there undergoing repairs until 16 February 1915 . On 25 May , Texas , along with battleships South Carolina , Louisiana , and Michigan , rescued 230 passengers from the damaged Holland America Line passenger ship <unk> , which had been rammed by Norwegian @-@ flagged fruit steamer Joseph J. Cuneo . In gratitude , Holland America Line presented Texas with a model of a 17th @-@ century warship , which is displayed with the wardroom silver as of 2014 . In 1916 , Texas became the first US battleship to mount anti @-@ aircraft guns with the addition of two 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) / 50 caliber guns on platforms atop the boat cranes , and the first to control gunfire with directors and rangefinders , analog forerunners of today 's computers . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Upon her return to active duty with the fleet , Texas resumed a schedule alternating between training operations along the New England coast and off the Virginia Capes and winter fleet tactical and gunnery drills in the West Indies . That routine lasted just over two years until the February @-@ to @-@ March crisis over unrestricted submarine warfare catapulted the US into World War I in April 1917 . The 6 April declaration of war found Texas riding at anchor in the mouth of the York River with the other Atlantic Fleet battleships . She remained in the Virginia Capes – Hampton Roads vicinity until mid @-@ August , conducting exercises and training Naval Armed Guard gun crews for service on board merchant ships . One of the gun crews trained aboard Texas was assigned to the merchant vessel Mongolia at the beginning of the war . On 19 April , the crew of Mongolia sighted a surfaced German U @-@ boat and the gun crew trained aboard Texas opened fire on the U @-@ boat averting an attack on Mongolia and firing the first American shots of World War I. 
 In August , she steamed to New York for repairs , arriving at Base 10 on 19 August and entering the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter . She completed repairs on 26 September and got underway for Port Jefferson that same day . During the mid @-@ watch on 27 September , she ran hard aground on Block Island . Captain Victor Blue and his navigator , confused about shore lights and more concerned about the minefield at the opening of Long Island Sound made the turn at the wrong time and ran the ship aground on the island from the bow all the way aft beyond midships . For three days , her crew lightened ship to no avail . On 30 September , tugs came to her assistance , and she finally backed clear . Hull damage dictated a return to the yard , and extensive repairs precluded her departure with Battleship Division 9 ( BatDiv 9 ) for the British Isles in November . The secondary battery was reduced to eighteen 5 @-@ inch guns in October 1917 . Captain Blue , a protege of Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels , was never court @-@ martialed and remained in command of Texas . The Navy Department held his navigator entirely responsible for the accident . 
 By December , she had completed repairs and moved south to conduct military simulations out of the York River . Mid @-@ January 1918 found the battleship back at New York preparing for the voyage across the Atlantic , including the removal of two more 5 @-@ inch guns , reducing the total number aboard to sixteen . She departed New York on 30 January 1918 , arrived at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands off the coast of Scotland on 11 February , and rejoined BatDiv 9 , by then known as the 6th Battle Squadron of Britain 's Grand Fleet . 
 Texas 's service with the Grand Fleet consisted entirely of convoy missions and occasional forays to reinforce the British squadron on blockade duty in the North Sea whenever German heavy units threatened . The fleet alternated between bases at Scapa Flow and at the Firth of Forth in Scotland . Texas began her mission five days after her arrival at Scapa Flow , when she sortied with the entire fleet to reinforce the 4th Battle Squadron , then on duty in the North Sea . She returned to Scapa Flow the next day and remained until 8 March , when she put to sea on a convoy escort mission from which she returned on 13 March . Texas and her division mates entered the Firth of Forth on 12 April but got underway again on the 17th to escort a convoy . The American battleships returned to base on 20 April . Four days later , Texas again stood out to sea to support the Second Battle Squadron the day after the German High Seas Fleet had sortied from Jade Bay toward the Norwegian coast to threaten an Allied convoy . Forward units caught sight of the retiring Germans on 25 April , but at such an extreme range there was no possibility of bringing the German fleet into engagement with the Grand Fleet . The Germans returned to their base that day , and the Grand Fleet , including Texas , did likewise on the next . 
 Texas and her division mates passed a relatively inactive May in the Firth of Forth . On 9 June , she got underway with the other warships of the 6th Battle Squadron and headed back to the anchorage at Scapa Flow , arriving there the following day . From 30 June to 2 July , Texas and her colleagues acted as escort for American minelayers adding to the North Sea mine barrage . After a two @-@ day return to Scapa Flow , Texas put to sea with the Grand Fleet to conduct two days of tactical exercises and war games . At the conclusion of those drills on 8 July , the fleet entered the Firth of Forth . For the remainder of World War I , Texas and the other battleships of Division 9 continued to operate with the Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron . With the German Fleet increasingly tied to its bases in the estuaries of the Jade and the Ems rivers , the American and British ships settled into a routine schedule of operations with little @-@ to @-@ no hint of combat operations . That state of affairs lasted until the Armistice ended hostilities on 11 November 1918 . At 03 : 35 on 21 November , she got underway to accompany the Grand Fleet to meet the surrendering German Fleet . The two fleets rendezvoused about 40 nmi ( 46 mi ; 74 km ) east of the Isle of May and proceeded to the Firth of Forth . Afterward , the American contingent moved to Portland Harbour , England , arriving there on 4 December . 
 = = = Inter @-@ War period = = = 
 On 12 December 1918 , Texas put to sea with <unk> 9 and 6 to meet President Woodrow Wilson embarked in George Washington on his way to the Paris Peace Conference . The rendezvous took place around 07 : 30 the following morning and provided an escort for the President into Brest , France , where the ships arrived at 12 : 30 that afternoon . On the afternoon of 14 December , Texas and the other American battleships departed Brest to return to the United States . The warships arrived off Ambrose light station on Christmas Day , 1918 , and entered New York the next day . 
 Following overhaul , Texas resumed duty with the Atlantic Fleet early in 1919 . On 10 March , she became the first American battleship to launch an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British @-@ built Sopwith Camel off the warship . Later in 1919 Texas 's captain , Nathan C. Twining , successfully employed naval aircraft to spot the fall of shells during a main battery exercise . The results were that aircraft @-@ borne gunfire spotters were significantly more accurate than shipboard spotters . In testimony to the Navy General Board , Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Whiting attested that the increase in gunfire effectiveness with air spotting was likely to be as great as 200 % . As a result of these first experiments , the Navy would add floatplanes to all of the fleet 's battleships and newer cruisers . In May 1919 , Texas served as a plane guard and navigational aid for the successful attempt by Navy Curtiss NC flying boat NC @-@ 4 to become the first airplane to cross the Atlantic . On 26 July 1919 Texas entered the Pacific Ocean as part of the newly formed Pacific Fleet and she would spend the next five and half years as a part of Pacific Fleet . On 17 July the following year , she was designated BB @-@ 35 under the Navy 's newly adopted alpha @-@ numeric system of hull classification symbols . 
 Texas left the Pacific on 16 January 1924 and returned to the east coast for overhaul and to participate in a training cruise to European waters with Naval Academy Midshipmen embarked . While operating in the Atlantic , on 25 November 1924 , she sank the incomplete battleship Washington in compliance with the Naval Arms Limitation Treaty of 1922 , and later that fall , conducted maneuvers as a unit of the Scouting Fleet . On 31 July 1925 , she entered Norfolk Navy Yard for a major modernization overhaul . The overhaul , which replaced both cage masts with tripod masts , replaced her 14 Babcock & Wilcox coal @-@ fired boilers with 6 Bureau Express oil @-@ fired boilers , and upgraded her fire @-@ control equipment , was completed on 23 November 1926 . Also , her AA armament was increased to eight 3 @-@ inch guns , and the torpedo tubes were removed . Six of the 5 @-@ inch guns were relocated to new main deck casemates at this time . 
 Following completion of her overhaul , Texas was designated the flagship of the United States Fleet and resumed duty along the eastern seaboard . She kept at that task until late 1927 , when she did a brief tour of duty in the Pacific from late September @-@ early December . In 1927 , Texas set another first with the showing of " talking " pictures for crew entertainment . Near the end of the year , Texas returned to the Atlantic and resumed normal duty with the Scouting Fleet . In January 1928 , she transported President Calvin Coolidge to Havana , Cuba , for the Pan @-@ American Conference and then continued on via the Panama Canal and the west coast to maneuvers with the fleet near Hawaii . 
 She returned to New York early in 1929 for her annual overhaul and had completed it by March when she began another brief tour of duty in the Pacific . She returned to the Atlantic in June and resumed normal duty with the Scouting Fleet . In April 1930 , she took time from her operating schedule to escort Leviathan into New York when that ship carried the returning US delegation to the London Naval Conference . In January 1931 , she left the yard at New York as flagship of the United States Fleet and headed via the Panama Canal to San Diego , California , and then on to Los Angeles ( port of San Pedro ) which became her home port for the next six years and three months . There would be a temporary redeployment back to the Atlantic from April to October 1934 . During this Pacific period , she served first as flagship for the entire Fleet and , later , as flagship for BatDiv 1 . 
 In the summer of 1937 , she once more was reassigned to the east coast , as the flagship of the Training Detachment , United States Fleet . Late in 1938 or early in 1939 , the warship became flagship of the newly organized Atlantic Squadron , built around BatDiv 5 . Through both organizational assignments , her labors were directed primarily to training missions , Midshipman cruises , Naval Reserve drills , and training members of the Fleet Marine Force . Also in 1937 , eight 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 28 mm ) AA guns in two quadruple mounts were added to improve the light AA armament . In December 1938 , Texas received for testing the first shipborne radar designed and made by a commercial company , RCA , for the US Navy , the <unk> <unk> . In 1941 , Texas was one of fourteen ships to receive the RCA CXAM @-@ 1 radar .

 Soon after war broke out in Europe in September 1939 , Texas began operating on the Neutrality Patrol , an American attempt to keep the war out of the western hemisphere . Later , as the United States moved toward more active support of the Allied cause , the warship began convoying ships carrying Lend @-@ Lease matériel to the United Kingdom . In February 1941 , the US 1st Marine Division was activated aboard Texas . On 1 February , Admiral Ernest J. King hoisted his flag as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the re @-@ formed Atlantic Fleet aboard Texas . That same year , while on Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic , Texas was stalked unsuccessfully by the German submarine U @-@ 203 . 
 = = = = Convoy duty = = = = 
 Sunday , 7 December 1941 , found the battleship at Casco Bay , Maine , undergoing a rest and relaxation period following three months of watch duty at Naval Station Argentia , Newfoundland . After 10 days at Casco Bay , she returned to Argentia and remained there until late January 1942 , when she got underway to escort a convoy to England . After delivering her charges , the battleship patrolled waters near Iceland until March when she returned home . Around this time , the secondary battery was reduced to six 5 @-@ inch guns and the light AA battery was greatly increased , with the two 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch / 75 caliber quad mount guns replaced by 6 ( later 10 ) quad mount 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) Bofors and 44 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Oerlikon cannons , the attack on Pearl Harbor having demonstrated the need for this . For the next six months , she continued convoy @-@ escort missions to various destinations . On one occasion , she escorted Guadalcanal @-@ bound marines as far as Panama ; on another , the warship screened service troops to Freetown , Sierra Leone , on the west coast of Africa . More frequently , she made voyages to and from the United Kingdom escorting both <unk> and troop @-@ carrying ships . 
 = = = = Operation Torch = = = = 
 On 23 October 1942 , Texas embarked upon her first major combat operation when she sortied with Task Group 34 @.@ 8 ( TG 34 @.@ 8 ) , the Northern Attack Group for Operation Torch , the invasion of North Africa . The objective assigned to this group was Port Lyautey in French Morocco . The warships arrived off the assault beaches near the village of <unk> early in the morning of 8 November and began preparations for the invasion . Texas transmitted Lt. General Dwight D. Eisenhower 's first " Voice of Freedom " broadcast , asking the French not to oppose Allied landings on North Africa . When the troops went ashore , Texas did not go into action immediately to support them . At that point in the war , the doctrine of amphibious warfare was still embryonic . Many Army officers did not recognize the value of <unk> bombardments . Instead , the Army insisted upon attempting a landing by surprise . Texas entered the battle early in the afternoon when the Army requested her to fire upon a Vichy French Army ammunition dump near Port Lyautey . One more gunfire mission was provided on the 10th before the cease fire on 11 November . Thus , unlike in later operations , she expended only 273 rounds of 14 @-@ inch shells and 6 rounds of 5 @-@ inch shells . During her short stay , some of her crewmen went ashore to assist in salvaging some of the ships that had been sunk in the harbor . On 16 November , Texas departed North Africa for the East Coast of the United States in a task force along with Savannah , Sangamon , Kennebec , four transports , and seven destroyers . 
 The young news reporter Walter Cronkite was on board Texas starting in Norfolk , Virginia , through her service off the coast of North Africa , and thence back to the US On the return trip , Cronkite was flown off Texas in one of her OS2U Kingfisher aircraft when Norfolk was within flying distance . He was granted permission to be flown the rest of the distance to Norfolk so that he could outpace a rival correspondent on Massachusetts to return to the US and to issue the first uncensored news reports to published about Operation Torch . Cronkite 's experiences aboard Texas launched his career as a war correspondent .

 Throughout 1943 , Texas carried out the familiar role of convoy escort . With New York as her home port , she made numerous transatlantic voyages to such places as Casablanca and Gibraltar , as well as frequent visits to ports in the British Isles . That routine continued into 1944 but ended on 22 April of that year when , at the European end of one such mission , she remained at the Clyde estuary in Scotland and began training for the invasion of Normandy . 
 = = = = = Rehearsal = = = = = 
 During the next twelve days , Texas carried out many 14 @-@ inch gun @-@ firing exercises with British battleships HMS Ramillies and Rodney . The firing was done in conjunction with Royal Air Force airplanes as spotters . On 29 April , Texas , Nevada , and Arkansas relocated to Belfast Lough , Northern Ireland . There , final preparations were made , including the removal of the airplane catapult and the ship 's OS2U Kingfisher observation planes . The three pilots who flew Texas 's Kingfishers during this period were temporarily transferred to a newly formed squadron , VOS @-@ 7 , that was composed of the pilots who flew observation and scouting planes from the cruisers Augusta , Quincy , and Tuscaloosa and the battleships Arkansas , Nevada , and Texas . VOS @-@ 7 received training in defensive fighter tactics , aerobatics , navigation , formation flying and spotting procedures in Royal Air Force Spitfires ; they flew spotting missions in the Spitfires because of the threat from German fighters . The pilots of VOS @-@ 7 would fly spotting missions for the US warships off Omaha and Utah Beaches during D @-@ Day . Also , during this time additional radio equipment was added , including a device to detect and jam radio @-@ guided missiles . Final exercises were carried out to the south in Dundrum Bay and Belfast Lough . During the final preparations , General Eisenhower came aboard on 19 May to speak to the crew . On 31 May , the ship was sealed and a briefing given to the crew about the upcoming invasion . For the invasion , Texas was designated Bombardment Force Flagship for Omaha Beach , in the Western Taskforce . Her firing area of Omaha was the western half , supporting the US 29th Infantry Division and the US 2nd Ranger Battalion at Pointe du Hoc , and the US 5th Ranger Battalion , which had been diverted to Western Omaha to support the troops at Pointe du Hoc . 
 The Omaha Beach bombardment force consisted of two sections with Texas and the British light cruiser HMS Glasgow responsible for the western half with Arkansas , and the French light cruisers Georges <unk> and Montcalm responsible for the east . Also assigned to Omaha Beach were the American destroyers Frankford , McCook , <unk> , Doyle , Emmons , Baldwin , Harding , Satterlee , Thompson , and the British destroyers HMS <unk> , Talybont and <unk> . 
 At 02 : 09 on 3 June , Texas and the rest of the Western Taskforce sailed from Belfast Lough for Normandy . In sight , on a parallel course was a group of British ships , including the battleships Warspite and Ramillies . At 07 : 10 on 4 June , the taskforce had to reverse course due to unacceptable weather in Normandy . Later that evening , off Lundy Island , the taskforce reversed course and headed for and joined the invasion fleet gathering at Area Z. The invasion fleet then headed south toward Normandy and navigated the German minefield , through which minesweepers had cleared channels ; not a single Omaha Beach vessel was lost . 
 = = = = = D @-@ Day = = = = = 
 At 03 : 00 on 6 June 1944 , Texas and the British cruiser Glasgow entered the Omaha Western fire support lane and into her initial firing position 12 @,@ 000 yd ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) offshore near Pointe du Hoc at 04 : 41 , as part of a combined total US @-@ British flotilla of 702 ships , including seven battleships and five heavy cruisers . The initial bombardment commenced at 05 : 50 , against the site of six 15 @-@ centimetre ( 6 in ) guns , atop Pointe du Hoc . When Texas ceased firing at the Pointe at 06 : 24 , 255 14 @-@ inch shells had been fired in 34 minutes — an average rate of fire of 7 @.@ 5 shells per minute , which was the longest sustained period of firing for Texas in World War II . While shells from the main guns were hitting Pointe du Hoc , the 5 @-@ inch guns were firing on the area leading up to Exit D @-@ 1 , the route to get inland from western Omaha . At 06 : 26 , Texas shifted her main battery gunfire to the western edge of Omaha Beach , around the town of Vierville . Meanwhile , her secondary battery went to work on another target on the western end of " Omaha " beach , a ravine laced with strong points to defend an exit road . Later , under control of airborne spotters , she moved her major @-@ caliber fire inland to interdict enemy reinforcement activities and to destroy batteries and other strong points farther inland . 
 By noon , the assault on Omaha Beach was in danger of collapsing due to stronger than anticipated German resistance and the inability of the Allies to get needed armor and artillery units on the beach . In an effort to help the infantry fighting to take Omaha , some of the destroyers providing gunfire support closed near the shoreline , almost grounding themselves to fire on the Germans . Texas also closed to the shoreline ; at 12 : 23 , Texas closed to only 3 @,@ 000 yd ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) from the water 's edge , firing her main guns with very little elevation to clear the western exit D @-@ 1 , in front of Vierville . Among other things , she fired upon snipers and machine gun nests hidden in a defile just off the beach . At the conclusion of that mission , the battleship attacked an enemy anti @-@ aircraft battery located west of Vierville . 
 On 7 June , the battleship received word that the Ranger battalion at Pointe Du Hoc was still isolated from the rest of the invasion force with low ammunition and mounting casualties ; in response , Texas obtained and filled two LCVPs with provisions and ammunition for the Rangers . Upon their return , the LCVPs brought thirty @-@ five wounded Rangers to Texas for treatment of which one died on the operating table . Along with the Rangers , a deceased Coast Guard sailor and twenty @-@ seven prisoners ( twenty Germans , four Italians , and three French ) were brought to the ship . The prisoners were fed , segregated , and not formally interrogated aboard Texas , due to the ship bombarding targets or standing by to bombard , before being loaded aboard an LST for transfer to England . Later in the day , her main battery rained shells on the enemy @-@ held towns of Formigny and Trévières to break up German troop concentrations . That evening , she bombarded a German mortar battery that had been shelling the beach . Not long after midnight , German planes attacked the ships offshore , and one of them swooped in low on Texas 's starboard quarter . Her anti @-@ aircraft batteries opened up immediately but failed to hit the intruder . On the morning of 8 June , her guns fired on Isigny , then on a shore battery , and finally on Trévières once more . 
 After that , she retired to Plymouth to rearm , returning to the French coast on 11 June . From then until 15 June , she supported the army in its advance inland . By 15 June , the troops had advanced to the edge of Texas 's gun range ; her last fire support mission was so far inland that to get the needed range , the starboard torpedo blister was flooded with water to provide a list of two degrees which gave the guns enough elevation to complete the fire mission . With combat operations beyond the range of her guns on 16 June , Texas left Normandy for England on 18 June . 
 = = = = Battle of Cherbourg = = = = 
 On the morning of 25 June Texas , in company with Arkansas , Nevada , four cruisers and eleven destroyers , closed in on the vital port of Cherbourg to suppress the fortifications and batteries surrounding the town while the US Army 's VII Corps attacked the city from the rear . While en route to Cherbourg , the bombardment plan was changed and Task Group 129 @.@ 2 ( TG 129 @.@ 2 ) , built around Arkansas and Texas , was ordered to move 6 mi ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) to the east of Cherbourg and engage the guns of Battery Hamburg , a large shore battery composed of four 24 @-@ centimetre ( 9 in ) guns . At 12 : 08 , Arkansas was the first to fire at the German positions , while the German gunners waited for Arkansas and Texas to be well in range to return fire . At 12 : 33 , Texas was straddled by three German shells ; five minutes later Texas returned fire with a continuous stream of two @-@ gun salvos . The battleship continued her firing runs in spite of shell geysers blossoming about her and difficulty spotting the targets because of smoke ; however , the enemy gunners were just as stubborn and skilled . At 13 : 16 , a German 24 @-@ cm shell skidded across the top of her conning tower , sheared the top of the fire control periscope off ( the periscope remains fell back into the conning tower and wounded the gunnery officer and three others ) , hit the main support column of the navigation bridge and exploded . The explosion caused the deck of the pilot house above to be blown upwards approximately 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) , wrecked the interior of the pilot house , and wounded seven . Of the eleven total casualties from the German shell hit , only one man succumbed to his wounds — the helmsman on duty , Christen Christensen . Texas 's commanding officer , Captain Baker , escaped unhurt and quickly had the bridge cleared . The warship herself continued to deliver her 14 @-@ inch shells in two @-@ gun salvos and , in spite of damage and casualties , scored a direct hit that penetrated one of the heavily reinforced gun emplacements to destroy the gun inside at 13 : 35 . 
 At 14 : 47 , an unexploded 24 @-@ cm shell was reported . The shell crashed through the port bow directly below the Wardroom and entered the stateroom of Warrant Officer M.A. Clark , but failed to explode . The unexploded shell was later disarmed by a Navy bomb disposal officer in Portsmouth and is currently displayed aboard the ship . Throughout the three @-@ hour duel , the Germans straddled and near @-@ missed Texas over sixty @-@ five times , but she continued her mission firing 206 14 @-@ inch shells at Battery Hamburg until ordered to retire at 15 : 01 . 
 = = = = Operation Dragoon = = = = 
 After Texas underwent repairs at Plymouth from damage sustained at Cherbourg , she drilled in preparation for the invasion of southern France . On 16 July , she departed Belfast Lough and headed for the Mediterranean . After stops at Gibraltar and Oran , Algeria , the battleship arrived in Taranto , Italy on 27 July . Departing Taranto on 11 August , Texas rendezvoused with three French destroyers off Bizerte , Tunisia , and set a course for the French Riviera . She arrived off Saint @-@ Tropez during the night of 14 August and was joined early the next morning by battleship Nevada and cruiser Philadelphia At 04 : 44 on 15 August , she moved into position for the pre @-@ landing bombardment and , at 0651 , opened up on her first target , a battery of five 15 @-@ cm guns . The beaches had been fortified and heavy resistance was expected . Due to very poor visibility that morning , Texas relied on her SG radar equipment to determine her position and track for both navigation and gunnery purposes . No landmarks were visible during the firing and for the greater part of the forenoon . 
 The heavy opposition that was expected never materialized , so the landing forces moved inland rapidly . As fire support from Texas 's guns was no longer required , she departed the southern coast of France on the early morning of 17 August . After a stop at Palermo , Sicily , she left the Mediterranean and headed for New York where she arrived on 14 September 1944 . 
 = = = = Operations Detachment and Iceberg = = = = 
 At New York , Texas underwent a 36 @-@ day repair period during which the barrels on her main battery were replaced . After a brief refresher cruise , she departed Maine in November and set a course , via the Panama Canal , for the Pacific . She made a stop at Long Beach , California , and then continued on to Oahu . She spent Christmas at Pearl Harbor and then conducted maneuvers in the Hawaiian Islands for about a month at the end of which she steamed to Ulithi Atoll . She departed Ulithi on 10 February 1945 , stopped in the Mariana Islands for two days of invasion rehearsals , and then she set a course for Iwo Jima . She arrived off Iwo Jima on 16 February , three days before the amphibious landings began . She spent just three days pounding the Japanese defenses on Iwo Jima in preparation for the landing of three Marine Corps Divisions . After the Marines stormed the beaches on 19 February , Texas switched to providing naval gunfire support for them . " On @-@ call fire " in response to requests from Marine units continued through 21 February . 
 Though the island of Iwo Jima was not declared to be captured until 16 March , Texas departed from the Volcano Islands on 7 March , and returned to Ulithi Atoll to prepare for the invasion of Okinawa ( Operation Iceberg ) . She departed from Ulithi with Task Force 54 , the gunfire support unit , on 21 March , and arrived in the Ryukyu Islands on the 26th . Texas moved in close to Okinawa and began her <unk> bombardment that same day . For the next six days , she fired multiple salvos from her main guns to prepare the way for several Army and Marine divisions to make their amphibious landings on 1 April . 
 Each evening , Texas retired from her bombardment position close to Okinawa , but returned the next morning to resume her bombardments . The enemy ashore , preparing for a defense @-@ in @-@ depth strategy as at Iwo Jima , made no answer . Only air units provided a response , as several kamikaze raids were sent to harass the bombardment group . Texas escaped damage during those attacks . On 1 April , after six days of aerial and naval bombardment , the ground troops went ashore , and for almost two months , Texas remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for the troops and fending off the enemy aerial assault . In performing the latter mission , she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assists . On 14 May she departed Okinawa for the Philippines . 
 = = = = End of the war = = = = 
 On 17 May , Texas arrived at Leyte in the Philippines and remained there until after the Japanese capitulation on 15 August . She returned to Okinawa toward the end of August and stayed in the Ryukyu Islands until 23 September . On that day , she set a course for the United States with homeward bound troops embarked as part of Operation Magic Carpet . The battleship delivered her passengers to San Pedro , California on 15 October , and celebrated Navy Day there on 27 October before resuming her mission to bring American troops home . She made two round @-@ trip voyages between California and Oahu in November and a third in late December . On 21 January 1946 , Texas departed San Pedro and steamed via the Panama Canal to Norfolk where she arrived on 13 February , and soon began preparations for inactivation . On 18 June , she was placed officially in reserve at Baltimore , Maryland .

 On 17 April 1947 , the Battleship Texas Commission was established by the Texas Legislature to care for the ship . The $ 225 @,@ 000 necessary to pay for towing her from Baltimore to San Jacinto was the Commission 's first task . On 17 March 1948 , Texas began her journey to her new anchorage along the busy Houston Ship Channel near the San Jacinto Monument , at San Jacinto State Park , arriving on 20 April , where she was turned over to the State of Texas the next day to serve as a permanent memorial . The date of 21 April is significant in that it was the date of the decisive 1836 Battle of San Jacinto that ended the War for Texas Independence and led to the creation of the Republic of Texas , which joined the US as a state in 1845 . Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1948 . Texas was the first permanent battleship memorial museum in the US . USS Oregon ( BB @-@ 3 ) was displayed as a floating museum in Portland , Oregon from 1925 to 1941 but was scrapped in 1956 . When the battleship was presented to the State of Texas , she was commissioned as the flagship of the Texas Navy .

 The funding produced by the Battleship Texas Commission was not up to the task of maintaining the ship . Consequently , years of neglect resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces , water intrusion , and steel deterioration . Paint in interior spaces began to crack , then flake , exposing metal surfaces underneath , which began to rust . At the same time , pipes open to the sea ultimately failed , flooding various voids and bunkers . By 1968 , the wooden main deck of the ship was so rotted that rainwater was leaking through the deck into the interior of the ship and pooling in various compartments . The Commission found that replacing the decayed deck timbers was prohibitively expensive . The solution at the time was to remove the wooden deck and replace it with concrete . The concrete eventually cracked , and again , rainwater began to leak through the main deck into spaces below . In 1971 , three local charitable institutions , the Brown Foundation , the Moody Foundation , and the Houston Endowment , together contributed $ 50 @,@ 000 to the ship to enable the Commission to sandblast and paint the hull . By this time , newspaper articles reported that Texas was " under attack " from neglect and insufficient funding . Nevertheless , Texas was designated a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1975 , and a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 1976 . 
 = = = Transfer to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department = = = 
 By 1983 , concerns with the leadership of the Battleship Texas Commission led to the decision by the State Legislature to turn over control of the ship to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department ( TPWD ) . The legislature abolished the commission effective 31 August 1983 , and TPWD assumed operational control the next day . One of the first actions by TPWD was to hire a firm of naval architects to survey the ship in order to assess the deterioration and make recommendations as to what actions should be taken to preserve the ship . The survey revealed that the ship 's watertight integrity was badly compromised , the hull was open to the sea in many places , and many compartments were full of standing rain water . The architects determined that the ship needed to go to dry dock for major repairs to the hull and to keep rain water from coming through the porous concrete deck . As part of this plan , serious consideration was given to protecting sensitive fabrics and restoring the interior of the ship . After a five @-@ year @-@ long fund @-@ raising campaign , $ 15 million was collected to dry dock the ship and complete necessary repairs . 
 = = = 1988 – 1990 dry dock period = = = 
 On 13 December 1988 , Texas was pulled from her berth with great difficulty over the course of six hours by six large tugboats to begin the 56 mi ( 49 nmi ; 90 km ) trip from her berth to Todd Shipyards in Galveston , Texas . Once under tow in the Houston Ship Channel she started taking on water , with a serious breach just forward of the engine rooms . The crew had three 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) pumps and two 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) pumps in continuous service to combat the flooding . During the nine @-@ plus hour transit , the ship 's draft increased 18 to 20 in ( 460 to 510 mm ) in the stern . Texas entered the yard 's floating drydock at approximately 22 : 30 on 13 December , at high tide with only 6 in ( 150 mm ) to spare between her hull and the blocks she would sit on . She underwent a 14 @-@ month refit that sought to restore the ship to her 1945 condition . While under refit , yard workers sand @-@ blasted paint from not only the hull but also the superstructure and replaced many tons of rusted metal from the hull . Inside the ship , welders and fabricators replaced weakened structural beams and numerous rusted @-@ out deck plates . Topside , workers removed the concrete from the main deck and made repairs . ( A new pinewood deck would be installed in Green 's Bayou . ) In total , more than 375 @,@ 000 lb ( 170 @,@ 000 kg ) of steel ( amounting to about 15 % of the ship 's hull ) was replaced and more than 40 @,@ 000 rivets were seal @-@ welded on the underwater hull . On 24 February 1990 , tugboats moved Texas from dry dock to a repair facility on Green 's Bayou for further repairs . It was here that the wood deck was installed and four of the ten mounts of quad 40 mm guns were installed . On 26 July , the ship was returned to her berth at San Jacinto where the final six mounts of 40 mm guns were installed . Repairs complete , the ship officially reopened to the public on 8 September 1990 . Since returning to her slip at San Jacinto , members of the ship 's staff and volunteers have worked to restore the interior spaces . 
 = = = Dry berth project = = = 
 After many years of evaluating a wide range of alternative plans to address the ship 's problems ( as well as other issues at San Jacinto ) , TPWD , working with many of the stakeholders at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site , adopted a Master Plan that called for placing Texas into a permanent dry berth . After the Master Plan was formally adopted by TPWD in 2004 , the Texas Legislature was approached to secure appropriate funding . The Legislature allowed the voters of Texas to express their opinion and on 6 November 2007 Texas voters approved $ 25 million in funds to dry @-@ berth the ship to prevent further deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel . 
 One of the provisions of the bond legislation is the Battleship <unk> Foundation ( BTF ) , a non @-@ profit support organization , raise $ 4 million in private funds to supplement the $ 25 million in bond funds . This will provide a total of $ 29 million to accomplish the goal . 
 With this vote @-@ of @-@ confidence in place , BTF contracted with an independent maritime engineering firm to make a survey of the ship to determine her condition . If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks , then the question of dry berthing would be moot . The survey reflected that , although her hull leaks , her keel and main supporting internal structure is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the ship in a dry berth . 
 Once it was determined that dry berthing was physically possible for the ship , it was necessary to make a preliminary evaluation of the engineering viable ways in which dry berthing could actually be accomplished . Again , an independent maritime engineering firm was contracted to study the full range of dry berth alternatives and to present a report of their findings to BTF and to TPWD . 
 TPWD , acting on the report of the ship 's condition , and on the report of the engineering viable dry berth alternatives , and on their internal studies and reports , prepared a progress report which they presented to the Legislative Budget Board ( <unk> ) in late July 2008 . 
 In March 2009 the <unk> released the funds for the dry berthing project to commence . After a lengthy selection process and fee negotiations , TPWD signed a contract with AECOM , on 26 October 2010 , to design and develop the plans for Texas 's dry @-@ berth . The contract called for AECOM to have its preliminary design completed by spring 2011 . Following a federally mandated environmental assessment for that is expected to take about two years , the bidding process for construction of the dry berth and temporarily mooring Texas is expected to begin in mid @-@ 2014 with construction to be completed by the summer of 2017 . 
 = = = Leaks = = = 
 In June 2010 , a leak on the starboard side of the ship caused Texas to sink two to three feet in her mooring . The leak was precipitated by a burned out pump , which allowed the ship to take on more water than usual . Consequently , a seam separation was pulled below the waterline creating a second leak . Once the leak was discovered , the broken pump was replaced . 105 @,@ 000 US gal ( 400 @,@ 000 l ; 87 @,@ 000 imp gal ) of water had to be pumped from the ship . After the leak was above the waterline again , a rag was stuffed in it as a temporary fix . On 9 June 2012 ( almost two years to the day later ) , about 30 new leaks , between 1 in ( 25 mm ) holes and 2 sq ft ( 0 @.@ 19 m2 ) gaps , were discovered , ultimately necessitating a three @-@ week closure of the ship to visitors ; removal of water and repair of these leaks was complicated by the presence of residual oil in Texas 's fuel bunkers . In less than a month , the leaks were fixed .

 Texas was the first and oldest of the eight US battleships that became permanent floating museums ; the other battleships honored in this way are Massachusetts , Alabama , North Carolina , New Jersey , Missouri , Wisconsin , and Iowa . Texas is also one of the oldest surviving modern naval ships , having turned 100 years old on 12 March 2014 . 
 Radio commemorations occur on Texas yearly during Museum Ship Weekend and Pearl Harbor Day .

 Texas has appeared in several films prior to and since her retirement . Her cinema debut , though brief , was in the final scene of the 1937 film Boy Of The Streets starring Jackie Cooper and Maureen O 'Conner . The 1966 Steve McQueen film The Sand Pebbles . In the 2001 film Pearl Harbor , Texas stood in for the various battleships that were attacked on Dec. 7 , 1941 . Some of the ship 's interiors were also used to portray the interior of the aircraft carrier Hornet later in the film . Texas also appears as herself in the 2006 films Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima ; in both movies the ship is depicted shelling Iwo Jima in preparation for the Marines ' amphibious assault . 
 Texas was a central plot element in the 1985 science fiction book " The <unk> Of Texas " by Daniel da Cruz , who served on the Texas in World War II . 
 = Flying Tiger Line Flight 739 = 
 Flying Tiger Line Flight 739 was a Lockheed L @-@ 1049 Super Constellation propliner chartered by the United States military that disappeared on March 16 , 1962 , over the Western Pacific Ocean . The aircraft was transporting 93 US soldiers and 3 South Vietnamese from Travis Air Force Base , California to Saigon , Vietnam . After refueling at Andersen Air Force Base , Guam , the Super Constellation was en route to Clark Air Base in the Philippines when it disappeared . All 107 aboard were declared missing and presumed dead . 
 The airliner 's disappearance prompted one of the largest air and sea searches in the history of the Pacific . Aircraft and surface ships from four branches of the US military searched more than 200 @,@ 000 square miles ( 520 @,@ 000 km2 ) during the course of eight days . A civilian tanker observed what appeared to be an in @-@ flight explosion believed to be the missing Super Constellation , though no trace of wreckage or debris was ever recovered . The Civil Aeronautics Board determined that , based on the tanker 's observations , Flight 739 probably exploded in @-@ flight , though an exact cause could not be determined without examining the remnants of the aircraft . 
 To date , this remains the worst aviation accident involving the Lockheed Constellation series . 
 = = Flight = = 
 The aircraft was a 5 @-@ year @-@ old Lockheed L @-@ <unk> Super Constellation with a total of 17 @,@ 224 airframe hours . It carried 11 American civilian crew members and 96 military passengers . The flight was operated by the Flying Tiger Line as Military Air Transport Service ( MATS ) Charter flight 739 . 
 The Super Constellation carried 93 jungle @-@ trained Army Rangers en route to South Vietnam . Their orders were to relieve soldiers in Saigon who had been training Vietnamese troops to fight Viet Cong guerrillas . Also on board were three members of the Vietnamese military . The flight crew consisted of eleven civilians based out of California , including four women . The pilot was Captain Gregory P. Thomas . 
 The flight originated from Travis Air Force Base , California , and was destined for Saigon . There were four planned refueling stops : Honolulu , Hawaii ; Wake Island ; Guam ; and Clark Air Base , Philippines . The flight arrived at Guam at 11 : 14 GMT after being delayed for minor maintenance on engines numbers 1 and 3 at Honolulu , and later at Wake Island . The aircraft departed from Guam at 12 : 57 GMT with an estimated time of arrival at the Philippines at 19 : 16 GMT . The Super Constellation carried nine hours of fuel for the 1 @,@ 600 miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km ) , 8 @-@ hour flight . 
 Eighty minutes after departure , at 14 : 22 GMT , the pilot radioed a routine message and gave his position as being 280 miles west of Guam at coordinates ( 13 ° 40 ′ N 140 ° 0 ′ E ) . The aircraft was expected to reach 14 ° 00 ′ N 135 ° 0 ′ E at 15 : 30 . At that time , the Guam <unk> experienced temporary communication difficulties with heavy radio static . At 15 : 39 the Guam radio operator attempted to contact the flight for a position report but was unable to establish contact . The aircraft was not seen or heard from again . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The Clark Field Rescue Coordinating Center declared the aircraft missing the morning of 16 March 1962 . Navy officials reported that they believed that the aircraft had crashed closer to Guam than the Philippines . At the time of the disappearance , the weather was clear and the sea calm . The Navy , Air Force , Coast Guard , and Marines ordered aircraft and ships to the area . 
 The first day of searching continued overnight . During the first two days of the search , vessels crisscrossed 75 @,@ 000 square miles ( 190 @,@ 000 km2 ) of ocean . Secretary of the Army Elvis Stahr told newspapers that " [ w ] e have not given up hope that it will be found and that those aboard are safe , " and that a " maximum effort " was being made . After four days of searching , Major General Theodore R. Milton of the 13th Air Force told newspapers that although the chance of finding survivors was doubtful , every effort would be made " as long as there is any hope at all . " 
 Search efforts included aircraft from Guam , Clark Field , the US 7th Fleet , and the Air Force at Okinawa . Additionally surface ships and aircraft from numerous U.S. bases in the western Pacific contributed to the search efforts . 
 After eight days , the search was called off . The search , which was at the time one of the largest to ever take place in the Pacific , had covered more than 200 @,@ 000 square miles ( 520 @,@ 000 km2 ) of ocean . 
 = = = Conspiracy theories = = = 
 Flight 739 was one of two Flying Tiger Line flights with military connections that were destroyed under similar circumstances on the same day . This led to suggestions of sabotage and conspiracy by both airline officials and the media . 
 Both Flight 739 and the other aircraft , a L @-@ 1049 Super Constellation , departed from Travis Air Force Base at around 09 : 45 PST on Wednesday 14 March 1962 and both encountered difficulties several hours later . The other aircraft was carrying " secret military cargo " when it crashed in the Aleutian Islands and caught fire . 
 Flying Tiger Lines released a statement outlining some possible reasons for the two occurrences , including sabotage of either or both aircraft , and kidnapping of Flight 739 and its passengers . The airline also said that these were merely " wild guesses " and that there was no evidence to support either theory . 
 = = = Possibility of sabotage = = = 
 A Liberian tanker , the SS T L <unk> , reported seeing a bright light in the sky near the aircraft 's expected position about 90 minutes after the last radio contact . US military officials described it as being a “ bright light strong enough to light a ship ’ s decks " . The Spokane Daily Chronicle reported that the tanker observed a flash of light approximately 500 miles ( 800 km ) west of Guam , followed immediately by two falling red lights falling to the ocean at different speeds . 
 A Civil Aeronautics Board investigation determined that witnesses aboard the tanker also observed what appeared to be vapor trails , and numerous crew members observed the two fireballs fall into the ocean . The tanker proceeded to the location where the fireballs had been observed to impact the ocean but was unable to find any trace of the falling objects during their six @-@ hour search . A spokesman at the rescue effort headquarters in Guam said that as time passed with no sign of the aircraft , " more credence is given to the possibility that the tanker may have seen the missing aircraft explode in flight . ” 
 Officials with the Flying Tiger Line said that if the investigation revealed that an explosion had occurred on board the aircraft , it would support their earlier theories of sabotage . The executive vice president of operation told the Associated Press that experts considered it impossible for explosions to occur on the Super @-@ Constellation in the course of normal operation . Additionally he claimed that there was nothing powerful enough aboard the aircraft to completely blow it apart , and that " something violent must have happened . " 
 The Civil Aeronautics Board determined that , given the observations of the tanker crew , the flight most likely exploded in midair . As no part of the wreckage was ever found , the CAB was unable to establish a determination of cause . The accident report concluded : 
 A summation of all relevant factors tends to indicate that the aircraft was destroyed in flight . However , due to the lack of any substantiating evidence the Board is unable to state with any degree of certainty the exact fate of N <unk> . 
 = James Murrell = 
 James Murrell ( c . 1785 – 16 December 1860 ) , also known as Cunning Murrell , was an English cunning man , or professional folk magician , who spent most of his life in the town of Hadleigh in the eastern English county of Essex . In this capacity , he reportedly employed magical means to aid in healing both humans and animals , exorcising malevolent spirits , countering witches , and restoring lost or stolen property to its owner . 
 Born in Rochford , Essex , Murrell grew up in the area before moving to Southwark in London , where he was married in 1812 . He had seventeen children with his wife , and the family later moved back to Essex , settling in Hadleigh , where Murrell gained work as a shoemaker . At some point he also began working as a cunning man , gaining fame for his work in this field on both sides of the Thames Estuary . Describing himself as " the Devil 's Master " , he cultivated an air of mystery about himself , also experimenting with the creation of iron witch bottles . On a number of occasions his magical activities gained the attention of the local press . Although many residents valued his services and viewed him as a good and benevolent individual , his activities proved controversial and divisive . Many educated figures criticised what they saw as his role in encouraging superstition among the local population ; his death certificate recorded his profession as that of a " quack doctor " . 
 Murrell 's fame greatly increased after his death when he was made the subject , albeit in a highly fictionalised form , of a 1900 novel by Arthur Morrison . Morrison also produced a more objective study of the cunning man , published in The Strand magazine . During the 1950s , the folklorist Eric Maple conducted further research on Murrell , finding much local folklore still surrounding him in the Hadleigh area , including the allegation that he had the ability to fly and to instantaneously transport himself vast distances . Murrell has continued to attract the attention of historians and folklorists studying English folk magic , and is referenced in works by scholars like Ronald Hutton , Owen Davies , and Ralph Merrifield . 
 = = Life and family = = 
 James Murrell was likely born in Rochford , Essex in 1785 , and then baptised on 9 October 1785 in the St. Mary the Virgin Church in Hawkwell , Essex . His parents were named Edward Murrell and Hannah Murrell , née <unk> . According to the investigations of the journalist Arthur Morrison , Murrell was the seventh son of a seventh son . After completing school , Murrell entered into an apprenticeship with the surveyor G. <unk> , who operated from Burnham , a town to which Murrell 's brother Edward had moved . There is evidence that Murrell subsequently moved to London , where he worked as a <unk> at a chemist 's shop in the 1800s or early 1810s . 
 On 12 August 1812 , Murrell married Elizabeth Francis Button at St. Olave 's Church , Bermondsey in Southwark . Button was also from Essex , having been baptised in Hadleigh on 5 December 1790 . Between 1814 and 1834 , there are baptismal and burial records of the couple having seventeen children , many of whom did not survive infancy . 
 On 26 December 1820 , Murrell returned to Essex to attend the wedding of his sister Hannah at Hawkwell 's St. Mary the Virgin Church . She and her new husband Daniel Whitwell then proceeded to move to nearby Canewdon , with Murrell visiting them there on a regular basis thereafter . By the early 1840s , one of Murrell 's daughters , Louisa , had moved in with the childless Daniel and Hannah . 
 Elizabeth Murrell died in Hadleigh on 16 April 1839 , aged forty @-@ nine . The cause of death was cited as " inflammation of the chest " , and her body was buried on 21 April in Hadleigh 's St. James the Less Church . In the 1841 national census , Murrell was documented as a shoemaker living in Hadleigh with four of his children ( Eliza , Matilda , Edward , and Eleanor ) . However , in the June 1844 wedding documentation of Eliza , Murrell was listed as a labourer , and on the October 1844 marriage documentation of Matilda , he was listed as a herb doctor . By the 1851 national census , he again specified his profession as that of a shoemaker , and recorded that he was living in Hadleigh with his children Edward , Eleanor , and Louisa , as well as with his grandson William <unk> . 
 No images of Murrell survive . Accounts describe him as a short man who walked with his hands behind his back and hummed as he went . He was also noted for wearing a hard hat , bobbed tale coat , and iron goggles , while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected . His appearance reportedly scared local children , of whom he was nevertheless fond . 
 = = Cunning career = = 
 In south @-@ east Essex , Murrell was known as " The Devil 's Master " , a title that he himself used as a self @-@ description . He cultivated an air of mystery about himself by keeping himself largely apart from wider community life , speaking seldom , and traveling largely at night . His house was locally known as a " place to avoid " and those visiting him reportedly often waited for some time outside , plucking up the courage to enter . Within the cottage , Murrell had drying herbs hanging from his ceiling , and his devices were reported to include a crystal , a mirror , and a bowl of water . Other items that Murrell used in his magical practices were a copper charm with which he would allegedly distinguish whether an individual was lying or not , and a " trick " telescope that supposedly enabled him " to see through brick walls " . The latter device was examined by an acquaintance of Murrell 's , who deemed it to be " a clumsily home @-@ made arrangement of bits of looking @-@ glass , such as might once have been bought at a toy @-@ shop " . Murrell possessed a library of books , including works on astrology and astronomy , conjuration , and medical texts . He also wrote a number of personal notebooks containing information on such topics , the last of which survived into at least the 1950s . 
 Murrell claimed that he could exorcise malevolent spirits , destroy witches , and restore lost or stolen property to its owner , as well as providing services as an astrologer , herbalist , and animal healer . He charged a halfpenny for curing warts , and two shillings and six pence for breaking a witch 's spell . He was reputed to cure sick animals by passing his hands over their affected area , muttering a prayer , and then hanging an amulet about their neck , and was requested to use these powers at farms in Essex , Suffolk , and northern Kent . During his lifetime , Murrell was known on both sides of the Thames Estuary , although not apparently beyond that . He did however receive postal correspondence from a range of places , including from Essex girls who were working as maids in London . 
 Murrell used witch bottles as part of his magical practices , and , during the 1950s , the folklorist Eric Maple encountered claims that Murrell was able to summon anyone he wished using them , including individuals who had gone overseas . Murrell experimented with the use of a witch bottle constructed out of iron ; he had two such devices created by a local smith , Stephen Choppen , and had the plug at the mouth soldered up before the bottle was placed in a fire as part of an anti @-@ bewitchment spell . The idea behind this was that the bottle itself would not explode under the heat , and that thus it could be reused on other occasions . According to folklore collected by Maple , the smith 's attempts , which were initially unsuccessful , succeeded only after Murrell had recited a charm . 
 According to Maple 's research , various accounts of Murrell 's astrological activities continued to be told in the community after the latter 's death . One held that he was able to predict the death of a man to the " very day and hour " while another was that he also predicted the time of his own death to the very minute . It was claimed that on one occasion he was asked to provide the horoscope of a newborn child , but that he refused , stating that " Make the most of the child , you will not have it for long " , after which the child soon died , while when an old lady asked him to predict the future for her , he refused to do so for more than nine years ahead , with her dying in the eighth . 
 Morrison found that the locals whom he spoke to – many of whom remembered Murrell from several decades before – found the cunning man to be " a white and lawful wizard , who warred against the powers of darkness with all his might " ; they added that it was " no sin to employ the arts of a man like him " . Conversely , Maple noted that his research indicated that attitudes toward Murrell varied within the local community . Although many individuals , particularly among the poor , viewed him as a valuable member of the community , others – particularly among the wealthier strata of society – deemed him to be " a dangerous quack and disseminator of superstitious nonsense " . Maple found one woman , Mrs Petchey , who described him as " a smuggler and a bad man . He did things that wouldn 't be allowed today - them <unk> , I mean . Nowadays , people would say he 'd sold his soul to the Devil , wouldn 't they ? They 'd put him away for his <unk> . " Conversely , Maple noted that Mrs Murrell , who was a descendent of James , described the cunning man as " a good man and a regular churchgoer " . According to the folklore obtained by Maple , Murrell would often have debates about Christian theology with a local parson , the Reverend Thomas <unk> – who had been Professor of Pastoral Theology at Queen 's College , Birmingham – and that <unk> expressed the view that Murrell " knows his Bible better than I do ... He is either a very good man or a very bad one , and I can 't make up my mind which . " 
 = = = Documented cases = = = 
 Several accounts about Murrell 's activities have been preserved , either because they were reported on by the regional press or because they were passed down in oral tradition . One example focused around a rumour that had spread in nearby Canewdon which claimed that two prominent local women were malevolent witches . One of these individuals was Mary Ann Atkinson , the wife of the Reverend William Atkinson , the vicar of Canewdon . The other was Eliza Lodwick , a widow who took control of the 500 acre Lambourne Hall following the death of her husband in 1826 ; on two separate occasions labourers were convicted of stealing from her , while another died accidentally on her property . Locals concerned that these women were witches approached the vicar with their beliefs , but he dismissed them . They subsequently turned to Murrell , asking for his aid in exposing the women as witches . According to claims made in the 1950s by the @-@ then 94 @-@ year @-@ old local man Arthur Downes , the Canewdon villagers believed that Murrell could force all of the witches to assemble and dance about the churchyard against their will by whistling . However , the vicar intervened , with locals believing that he was doing so to protect his wife . The vicar himself died in March 1847 . 
 In April 1849 , the Ipswich Express and Lloyd 's Weekly Newspaper reported on a case in a village near to Rayleigh in which a girl had been afflicted with fits . Her family believed that a witch was to blame , with Murrell being called in to free her of the perceived bewitchment . He commissioned the local blacksmith to create an iron witch bottle , into which he placed toe @-@ nail clippings and locks of hair belonging to the putative victim . The bottle was then placed into the hearth and heated until it exploded , with this supposedly defeating the witch 's machinations . 
 In February 1857 the Chelmsford Chronicle reported that £ 10 in silver had been stolen from Golding Spearman , keeper of the Tilbury Fort canteen . When the police were unable to identify the culprit , Spearman turned to Murrell , who asserted that he would place a spell on the thief which would result in the return of the money . Shortly after , a soldier discovered the stolen money and returned it to Spearman , who attributed its retrieval to Murrell . 
 In September 1858 , the Brazier family accused Mrs Mole , a labourer 's wife who lived in East Thorpe , Essex , of bewitching their daughter and livestock . Hoping to have the bewitchment removed , they consulted a local cunning @-@ man known as Burrell , who lived at nearby <unk> . When Burrell was unable to help , they proceeded to consult Murrell , inviting him to come to East Thorpe to remove the curse . Murrell 's planned visit generated much anticipation in East Thorpe 's community , with the local rector attempting to calm the situation by requesting that the parish relieving officer move the allegedly bewitched girl to the union @-@ house , where she could be examined by the parish surgeon . Nevertheless , the officer of the poor refused to comply , asserting that Murrell 's arrival would correct the problem . Persisting , the rector applied to the local magistrate to ensure that police would be in the village on the day of Murrell 's arrival , to ensure that the crowd would be controlled . On the day itself , a crowd of two hundred had gathered , and proceeded to Mrs Mole 's house with the intention of carrying out folk justice ; concerned by this illegal behaviour , the rector stood outside of her door and forbade the crowd entry , prior to police arriving and dispersing the mob . 
 On 9 November 1858 , the Bury and Norwich Post recorded that earlier that month , a waistcoat , silk handkerchief , and £ 3 in gold were stolen from a labourer , Richard Butcher , who lived in Stanford @-@ le @-@ Hope . Butcher had gone to Murrell , asking him to use his skills to locate and retrieve his stolen property ; when Murrell failed to do so , Butcher turned to the police to apprehend the culprit . Other accounts were passed down in local folk accounts ; Maple interviewed an eighty @-@ six @-@ year @-@ old Mrs Petchey , who stated that " My mother lost a brooch , and Murrell told her who had stolen it . It was her own sister @-@ in @-@ law . He wouldn 't tell her , though , unless she promised not to tell anyone . The brooch was back in its old place a few days later . " 
 = = Death = = 
 Local records indicate that Murrell died in Hadleigh on 16 December 1860 . On his death certificate , his profession was listed as " Quack Doctor " , and his cause of death was attributed to " natural causes " . On 23 December his body was inhumed into the eastern side of the churchyard at St James the Less Church , near to where many of his deceased children had been buried . It was not marked by any tombstone . 
 His son later told Morrison that the cunning man had informed his own daughter of the exact time and date at which he would die prior to it actually happening . Another story reports that Murrell took to his death bed aware of his oncoming demise , informing his daughter to turn away the curate " For I be the devil 's master as be well knowed . Clergymen den 't bother me in the <unk> time , they shan 't now [ sic ] " . Conversely , Maple recorded a story that in his final hours , Murrell was visited by the local curate ; Murrell was frustrated by the latter 's attempts to administer religious consolation and eventually scared him off by shouting out " I am the Devil 's master " . 
 An alternate story spread that Murrell had been killed by a witch @-@ bottle that had been placed into a fire by an aggrieved local man who believed that Murrell had bewitched his donkey and thus caused its death . The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield concluded that this tale was " probably entirely apocryphal " . Another story given by Choppen was that Murrell 's son Edward – or " Buck " as he was nicknamed – had taken the cunning man 's final witch @-@ bottle . Placing the bottle in his household fire , it was there that the bottle exploded and destroyed a wall of Buck 's cottage . 
 Murrell left no will . His son Edward later claimed that Murrell 's landlord soon buried a wooden chest with the old man 's papers in the garden of the cottage , deeming their associations with magic to be dangerous . Edward claimed that he subsequently dug the chest up again . Murrell 's personal effects were treated as souvenirs , and several were treated as though they retained magical and supernatural associations for many years after his death . Murrell 's " trick " telescope was sold by his son for half @-@ a @-@ guinea ; the purchaser was allegedly found dead shortly after with half @-@ a @-@ guinea lodged in his throat , resulting in claims that the telescope itself brought bad luck onto anyone who possessed it . In 1960 , Maple commented that Murrell 's whalebone umbrella had been owned by a local undertaker until fairly recently , while he also noted that Murrell 's carved chest was in the possession of a woman who lived at Southend @-@ on @-@ Sea .

 Maple ultimately described Murrell as " the greatest and certainly the most influential of all the Cunning Men of the Essex marshlands " , and elsewhere he termed him " perhaps the last of the great Cunning Men " , noting that upon his death Murrell " became part of the great heritage of English witch mythology " . Having studied the cunning man 's legacy during the late 1950s , Maple believed that Murrell " succeeded in agitating the old fear of witchcraft into something like a mania " among the local community , and that " in doing so he unwittingly preserved the old traditions and folktales for a generation beyond their normal span , and in this respect folklorists are in his debt " . The historian Ronald Hutton has characterised Murrell as the " most celebrated cunning man in the whole of nineteenth @-@ century southern England " . 
 = = = Local folklore = = = 
 Murrell continued to remain the subject of local discussion after his death . Maple believed that the legacy created within these communities was a combination of both fact and myth , with " Murrell the man " being supplanted by " Murrell the myth " , around which a " vast wealth of lore " accrued . Maple noted that many of the attributes associated with witches in British folklore came to be associated with the cunning man . For instance , he highlighted the existence of local stories that credited Murrell with the ability to fly , and that he was once observed flying over the River Crouch on a broomstick . Another story held that Murrell had been talking to a group of old men in Canvey Island before suddenly vanishing and reappearing in his own village , which was several miles away . 
 One young boy reported having observed the ghost of Murrell collecting herbs at some point after this death ; he passed this story on to his daughter , who told it to Maple . Hadleigh also had other ghost lore traditions , surrounding figures known as the White Lady and the Black Man , the latter being a prince and the former a woman who would allegedly invite passers by to join her in a waltz through the ruins of Hadleigh Castle . 
 In a 2014 article published in the British occult magazine The Cauldron , Richard Ward suggested that the folk stories surrounding Murrell were later transposed to another local figure , George Pickingill of Canewdon , who would also come to be regarded as a cunning man in local folklore by the 1950s . He noted in particular that Pickingill was accredited with the ability to command the witches of Canewdon to reveal themselves , a trait that Downes had previously attributed to Murrell . Hutton accepted this as a possibility yet lamented that the claim seemed to be " incapable of solid proof " . 
 In 2011 , Robert Hallman , a local Hadleigh resident , suggested that the community should memorialise Murrell in some way , either by naming a local street after him or erecting a statue in the centre of the town . 
 = = = Investigations = = = 
 Three decades after Murrell 's death , in the late 19th century , Morrison visited Hadleigh on a holiday , expressing the view that the area was " still in the eighteenth century as regards aspect , costume , habits , and mode of thought " . He learned about Murrell , and decided " to write a story about him " , believing that " some might find it hard to believe that such a man , practicing such arts and wielding such influence , could have lived so recently within so short a distance from London " . The landlord of the Castle Inn , a local pub , showed Morrison to the house in which Murrell had once lived , and the journalist was also able to meet with Choppen , the smith who had made Murrell 's witch bottles . Morrison found that Choppen was living in a small house on the outskirts of Hadleigh ; the craftsman revealed that while he had none of the bottles left , he was in possession of Murrell 's spectacles . Morrison subsequently met with Murrell 's son Edward – " a short , sturdy old fellow , with <unk> head of loose , white hair " – who was then living in Thundersley . Morrison subsequently authored Cunning Murrell , a fictitious account of Murrell 's life , as well as a more objective account , the latter for The Strand magazine . It was Morrison 's novel that turned Murrell into a national figure and " inflated the name of the old Essex wizard above all others of his craft " . 
 At the turn of the century between the 19th and 20th , the Reverend King , an antiquarian who worked as the vicar of Leigh , began to examine Murrell 's life , believing it to have had some significance , although never completed his research . 
 Murrell 's correspondences and papers – then contained in the wooden chest owned by his son – were examined by Morrison during the course of his research . These texts survived until 1956 , at which point they were burned by someone who did not believe them to be of any importance . Many of Murrell 's handwritten books were also lost , although his scrapbook of astrological data had survived until at least the late 1950s , when it was in the collection of a local man who also possessed Murrell 's iron churchwarden pipe . 
 Maple published a 1960 paper on Murrell in the Folklore Society 's journal , Folklore , which was based both on the earlier textual sources and on oral traditions that he had obtained from elderly residents of the district . These included one of his descendants , a Mrs Murrell of Westcliff @-@ on @-@ Sea . Troubled by the mixed reception that Murrell had , she expressed the view that he was a good man . She also commented that that Murrell 's power to control mechanical objects had remained within the family , characterising them as " natural mechanics " . 
 = Slate industry in Wales = 
 The existence of a slate industry in Wales is attested since the Roman period , when slate was used to roof the fort at Segontium , now Caernarfon . The slate industry grew slowly until the early 18th century , then expanded rapidly until the late 19th century , at which time the most important slate producing areas were in northwest Wales , including the Penrhyn Quarry near Bethesda , the Dinorwic Quarry near Llanberis , the Nantlle Valley quarries , and Blaenau Ffestiniog , where the slate was mined rather than quarried . Penrhyn and Dinorwig were the two largest slate quarries in the world , and the Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was the largest slate mine in the world . Slate is mainly used for roofing , but is also produced as thicker slab for a variety of uses including flooring , <unk> and headstones . 
 Up to the end of the 18th century , slate was extracted on a small scale by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord , carted slate to the ports , and then shipped it to England , Ireland and sometimes France . Towards the close of the century , the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves , on a larger scale . After the government abolished slate duty in 1831 , rapid expansion was propelled by the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates to the ports . 
 The slate industry dominated the economy of north @-@ west Wales during the second half of the 19th century , but was on a much smaller scale elsewhere . In 1898 , a work force of 17 @,@ 000 men produced half a million tons of slate . A bitter industrial dispute at the Penrhyn Quarry between 1900 and 1903 marked the beginning of its decline , and the First World War saw a great reduction in the number of men employed in the industry . The Great Depression and Second World War led to the closure of many smaller quarries , and competition from other roofing materials , particularly tiles , resulted in the closure of most of the larger quarries in the 1960s and 1970s . Slate production continues on a much reduced scale . 
 The Slate industry in North Wales is on the tentative World Heritage Site list . 
 = = Beginnings = = 
 The slate deposits of Wales belong to three geological series : Cambrian , Ordovician and Silurian . The Cambrian deposits run south @-@ west from Conwy to near Criccieth ; these deposits were quarried in the Penrhyn and Dinorwig quarries and in the Nantlle Valley . There are smaller outcrops elsewhere , for example on Anglesey . The Ordovician deposits run south @-@ west from Betws @-@ y @-@ Coed to Porthmadog ; these were the deposits mined at Blaenau Ffestiniog . There is another band of Ordovician slate further south , running from <unk> to Aberdyfi , quarried mainly in the Corris area , with a few outcrops in south @-@ west Wales , notably Pembrokeshire . The Silurian deposits are mainly further east in the Dee valley and around Machynlleth . 
 The virtues of slate as a building and roofing material have been recognized since the Roman period . The Roman fort at Segontium , Caernarfon , was originally roofed with tiles , but the later levels contain numerous slates , used for both roofing and flooring . The nearest deposits are about five miles ( 8 km ) away in the Cilgwyn area , indicating that the slates were not used merely because they were available on @-@ site . During the mediaeval period , there was small @-@ scale quarrying of slate in several areas . The Cilgwyn quarry in the Nantlle Valley dates from the 12th century , and is thought to be the oldest in Wales . The first record of slate quarrying in the neighbourhood of the later Penrhyn Quarry was in 1413 , when a rent @-@ roll of Gwilym ap Griffith records that several of his tenants were paid 10 pence each for working 5 @,@ 000 slates . Aberllefenni Slate Quarry may have started operating as a slate mine as early as the 14th century . The earliest confirmed date of operating dates from the early 16th century when the local house Plas Aberllefenni was roofed in slates from this quarry . 
 Transport problems meant that the slate was usually used fairly close to the quarries . There was some transport by sea . A poem by the 15th century poet Guto 'r Glyn asks the Dean of Bangor to send him a shipload of slates from <unk> , near Bangor , to Rhuddlan to roof a house at <unk> , near Denbigh . The wreck of a wooden ship carrying finished slates was discovered in the Menai Strait and is thought to date from the 16th century . By the second half of the 16th century , there was a small export trade of slates to Ireland from ports such as Beaumaris and Caernarfon . Slate exports from the Penrhyn estate are recorded from 1713 when 14 shipments totalling 415 @,@ 000 slates were sent to Dublin . The slates were carried to the ports by pack @-@ horses , and later by carts . This was sometimes done by women , the only female involvement in what was otherwise an exclusively male industry . 
 Until the late 18th century , slate was extracted from many small pits by small partnerships of local men , who did not own the capital to expand further . The quarrymen usually had to pay a rent or royalty to the landlord , though the quarrymen at Cilgwyn did not . A letter from the agent of the Penrhyn estate , John Paynter , in 1738 complains that competition from Cilgwyn was affecting the sales of Penrhyn slates . The Cilgwyn slates could be extracted more cheaply and sold at a higher price . Penrhyn introduced larger sizes of slate between 1730 and 1740 , and gave these sizes the names which became standard . These ranged from " Duchesses " , the largest at 24 inches ( 610 mm ) by 12 inches ( 300 mm ) , through " Countesses " , " Ladies " and " Doubles " to the smallest " Singles " . 
 = = Growth ( 1760 – 1830 ) = = 
 <unk> Jones , previously a quarryman at Cilgwyn , began to work the <unk> quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog in the 1760s , which became the first large quarry in the area . The large landowners were initially content to issue " take notes " , allowing individuals to quarry slates on their lands for a yearly rent of a few shillings and a royalty on the slates produced . The first landowner to take over the working of slates on his land was the owner of the Penrhyn estate , Richard Pennant , later Baron Penrhyn . In 1782 , the men working quarries on the estate were bought out or ejected , and Pennant appointed James Greenfield as agent . The same year , Lord Penrhyn opened a new quarry at <unk> near Bethesda , which as Penrhyn Quarry would become the largest slate quarry in the world . By 1792 , this quarry was employing 500 men and producing 15 @,@ 000 tons of slate per year . At Dinorwig , a single large partnership took over in 1787 , and in 1809 the landowner , Thomas Assheton Smith of <unk> , took the management of the quarry into his own hands . The Cilgwyn quarries were taken over by a company in 1800 , and the scattered workings at all three locations were amalgamated into a single quarry . The first steam engine to be used in the slate industry was a pump installed at the <unk> quarry in the Nantlle Valley in 1807 , but most quarries relied on hydropower to drive machinery . 
 Wales was by now producing more than half the United Kingdom 's output of slate , 26 @,@ 000 tons out of a total UK production of 45 @,@ 000 tons in 1793 . In July 1794 , the government imposed a 20 % tax on all slate carried coastwise , which put the Welsh producers at a disadvantage compared to inland producers who could use the canal network to distribute their product . There was no tax on slates sent overseas , and exports to the United States gradually increased . The Penrhyn Quarry continued to grow , and in 1799 Greenfield introduced the system of " galleries " , huge terraces from 9 metres to 21 metres in depth . In 1798 , Lord Penrhyn constructed the horse @-@ drawn <unk> Tramway to transport slates from Penrhyn Quarry , and in 1801 this was replaced by the narrow gauge Penrhyn Quarry Railway , one of the earliest railway lines . The slates were transported to the sea at Port Penrhyn which had been constructed in the 1790s . The Padarn Railway was opened in 1824 as a tramway for the Dinorwig Quarry , and converted to a railway in 1843 . It ran from <unk> Ddu near Llanberis to Port Dinorwic at Y <unk> . The Nantlle Railway was built in 1828 and was operated using horse @-@ power to carry slate from several slate quarries in the Nantlle Valley to the harbour at Caernarfon . 
 = = Peak production ( 1831 – 1878 ) = = 
 = = = Expansion at Blaenau Ffestiniog = = = 
 In 1831 slate duty was abolished , and this helped to produce a rapid expansion in the industry , particularly since the duty on tiles was not abolished until 1833 . The Ffestiniog Railway line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport slate from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog , where it was loaded onto ships . The railway was graded so that loaded slate waggons could be run by gravity downhill all the way from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port . The empty waggons were hauled back up by horses , which travelled down in ' dandy ' waggons . This helped expansion at the Blaenau Ffestiniog quarries , which had previously had to cart the slate to Maentwrog to be loaded onto small boats and taken down the River <unk> to the estuary , where it was transferred to larger vessels . There was further expansion at Blaenau when John Whitehead Greaves , who had been running the Votty quarry since 1833 , took a lease on the land between this quarry and the main Ffestiniog to Betws @-@ y @-@ Coed road . After years of digging he struck the famous Old Vein in 1846 in what became the Llechwedd quarry . A fire which destroyed a large part of Hamburg in 1842 led to a demand for slate for rebuilding , and Germany became an important market , particularly for Ffestiniog slate . 
 = = = Mechanization and increased production = = = 
 In 1843 , the Padarn Railway become the first quarry railway to use steam locomotives , and the transport of slate by train rather than by ship was made easier when the London and North Western Railway built branches to connect Port Penrhyn and Port Dinorwic to the main line in 1852 . The Corris Railway opened as the horse @-@ worked Corris , Machynlleth & River Dovey Tramroad in 1859 , connecting the slate quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni with wharves on the estuary of the River Dyfi . The Ffestiniog Railway converted to steam in 1863 , and the Talyllyn Railway was opened in 1866 to serve the Bryn Eglwys quarry above the village of Abergynolwyn . Bryn Eglwys grew to be one of the largest quarries in mid Wales , employing 300 men and producing 30 % of the total output of the Corris district . The Cardigan Railway was opened in 1873 , partly to carry slate traffic , and enabled the <unk> quarry in Pembrokeshire to grow to employ 80 men . 
 Mechanization was gradually introduced to make most aspects of the industry more efficient , particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north , and therefore easier to work by machine . The slate mill evolved between 1840 and 1860 , powered by a single line shaft running along the building and bringing together operations such as sawing , planing and dressing . In 1859 , John Whitehead Greaves invented the Greaves sawing table to produce blocks for the splitter , then in 1856 introduced a rotary machine to dress the split slate . The splitting of the blocks to produce roofing slates proved resistant to mechanization , and continued to be done with a mallet and chisel . An extra source of income from the 1860s was the production of " slab " , thicker pieces of slate which were planed and used for many purposes , for example flooring , tombstones and billiard tables . 
 The larger quarries could be highly profitable . The Mining Journal estimated in 1859 that the Penrhyn quarries produced an annual net profit of GB £ 100 @,@ 000 , and the Dinorwig Quarry £ 70 @,@ 000 a year . From 1860 onwards slate prices rose steadily . Quarries expanded and the population of the quarrying districts increased , for example the population of Ffestiniog parish increased from 732 in 1801 to 11 @,@ 274 in 1881 . Total Welsh production reached 350 @,@ 000 tons a year by the end of the 1860s . Of this total , over 100 @,@ 000 tons came from the Bethesda area , mainly from the Penrhyn Quarry . Blaenau Ffestiniog produced almost as much , and the Dinorwig Quarry alone produced 80 @,@ 000 tons per year . The Nantlle Valley quarries produced 40 @,@ 000 tons , while the remainder of Wales outside these areas produced only about 20 @,@ 000 tons per year . By the late 1870s , Wales was producing 450 @,@ 000 tons of slate per year , compared with just over 50 @,@ 000 tons for the rest of the United Kingdom , which then included Ireland . In 1882 , 92 % of the United Kingdom 's production was from Wales with the quarries at Penrhyn and Dinorwig producing half of this between them . Alun Richards comments on the importance of the slate industry : 
 The prosperity of the slate industry led to the growth of a number of other associated industries . Shipbuilding increased at a number of coastal locations , particularly at Porthmadog , where 201 ships were built between 1836 and 1880 . Engineering companies were set up to supply the quarries , notably De Winton at Caernarfon . In 1870 , De Winton built and equipped an entire workshop for the Dinorwig Quarry , with machinery powered by overhead shafting that in its turn was driven by the largest water @-@ wheel in the United Kingdom , over 50 feet in diameter . 
 = = = Workers = = = 
 There were several different categories of worker in the quarries . The quarrymen proper , who made up just over 50 % of the workforce , worked the slate in partnerships of three , four , six or eight , known as " bargain gangs " . A gang of four typically consisted of two " rockmen " who would blast the rock to produce blocks , a splitter , who would split the blocks with hammer and chisel , and a dresser . A <unk> would usually be a boy learning his trade , who would wander around the galleries offering assistance to the gangs . Sometimes a gang would give him a block of slate to split . Other groups were the " bad rockmen " who usually worked in crews of three , removing unworkable rock from the face , and the " rubbish men " who cleared the waste rock from the galleries and built the tips of waste which surrounded the quarry . One ton of saleable slate could produce up to 30 tons of waste . 
 The bad rockmen and rubbish men were usually paid by the ton of material removed , but the quarrymen were paid according to a more complicated system . Part of the payment was determined by the number of slates the gang produced , but this could vary greatly according to the nature of the rock in the section allocated to them . The men would therefore be paid an extra sum of " poundage " per pound 's worth of slate produced . " Bargains " were let by the setting steward , who would agree a price for a certain area of rock . If the rock in the bargain allocated to a gang was poor , they would be paid a higher poundage , while good rock meant a lower poundage . The first Monday of every month was " bargain letting day " when these agreements were made between men and management . The men had to pay for their ropes and chains , for tools and for services such as sharpening and repairing . Subs ( advances ) were paid every week , everything being settled up on the " day of the big pay " . If conditions had not been good , the men could end up owing the management money . This system was not finally abolished until after the Second World War . 
 Because of this arrangement , the men tended to see themselves as independent contractors rather than employees on a wage , and trade unions were slow to develop . There were grievances however , including unfairness in setting bargains and disputes over days off . The North Wales Quarrymen 's Union ( <unk> ) was formed in 1874 , and the same year there were disputes at Dinorwig and then at Penrhyn . Both these disputes ended in victory for the workers , and by May 1878 , the union had 8 @,@ 368 members . One of the founders of the union , Morgan Richards , described in 1876 the conditions when he started work in the quarries forty years before : 
 = = Industrial unrest and decline ( 1879 – 1938 ) = = 
 = = = Labour disputes = = = 
 In 1879 , a period of twenty years of almost uninterrupted growth came to an end , and the slate industry was hit by a recession which lasted until the 1890s . Management responded by tightening rules and making it more difficult for the men to take time off . Labour relations were worsened by differences in language , religion and politics between the two sides . The owners and top managers at most of the quarries were English @-@ speaking , Anglican and Tory , while the quarrymen were Welsh @-@ speaking and mainly Nonconformist and Liberal . Negotiations between the two sides usually involved the use of interpreters . In October 1885 , there was a dispute at Dinorwig over the curtailing of holidays which led to a lock @-@ out lasting until February 1886 . At the Penrhyn Quarry , George Sholto Gordon Douglas @-@ Pennant took over from his father Edward Gordon Douglas @-@ Pennant in 1885 , and in 1886 appointed E. A. Young as chief manager . A more stringent management regime was introduced , and relations with the workforce deteriorated . This culminated in the suspension of 57 members of the union committee and 17 other men in September 1896 , leading to a strike which lasted eleven months . The men were eventually obliged to go back to work , essentially on the management 's terms , in August 1897 . This strike became known as " The Penrhyn Lockout " . 
 There was an upturn in trade in 1892 , heralding another period of growth in the industry . This growth was mainly at Blaenau Ffestiniog and in the Nantlle Valley , where the workforce at <unk> reached 450 . Slate production in Wales peaked at over half a million tons in 1898 , with 17 @,@ 000 men employed in the industry . A second lock @-@ out or strike at the Penrhyn Quarry began on 22 November 1900 and lasted for three years . The causes of the dispute were complex , but included the extension of a system of contracting out parts of the quarry . The quarrymen , instead of arranging their own bargains , would find themselves working for a contractor . The union 's funds for strike pay were inadequate , and there was a great deal of hardship among the 2 @,@ 800 workers . Lord Penrhyn reopened the quarry in June 1901 , and about 500 men returned to work , to be castigated as " traitors " by the remainder . Eventually the workers were forced to return to work in November 1903 on terms laid down by Lord Penrhyn . Many of the men considered to have been prominent in the union were not re @-@ employed , and many of those who had left the area to seek work elsewhere did not return . The dispute left a lasting legacy of bitterness in the Bethesda area . 
 = = = Decline in production = = = 
 The loss of production at Penrhyn led to a temporary shortage of slates and kept prices high , but part of the shortfall was made up by imports . French exports of slate to the UK increased from 40 @,@ 000 tons in 1898 to 105 @,@ 000 tons in 1902 . After 1903 there was a depression in the slate industry which led to reductions in pay and job losses . New techniques in tile manufacture had reduced costs , making tiles more competitive . Eight Ffestiniog quarries closed between 1908 and 1913 , and the Oakley dismissed 350 men in 1909 . R. <unk> Jones comments : 
 The First World War hit the slate industry badly , particularly in Blaenau Ffestiniog where exports to Germany had been an important source of income . Cilgwyn , the oldest quarry in Wales , closed in 1914 , though it later reopened . In 1917 , slate quarrying was declared a non @-@ essential industry and a number of quarries were closed for the remainder of the war . The demand for new houses after the end of the war brought back a measure of prosperity ; in the slate mines of Blaenau Ffestiniog production was almost back to 1913 levels by 1927 , but in the quarries the output was still well below the pre @-@ war level . The Great Depression in the 1930s led to cuts in production , with exports particularly hard hit . 
 The quarries and mines made increasing use of mechanization from the start of the 20th century , with electricity replacing steam and water as a power source . The Llechwedd Quarry introduced its first electrical plant in 1891 , and in 1906 , a hydro @-@ electric plant was opened in Cwm Dyli , on the lower slopes of Snowdon , which supplied electricity to the largest quarries in the area . The use of electric saws and other machinery reduced the hard manual labour involved in extracting the slate , but produced much more slate dust than the old manual methods , leading to an increased incidence of silicosis . The work was also dangerous in other ways , with the blasting operations responsible for many deaths . A government enquiry in 1893 found that the death rate for underground workers in the slate mines was 3 @.@ 23 per thousand , higher than the rate for coal miners . 
 = = End of large @-@ scale production ( 1939 – 2005 ) = = 
 The outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to a severe drop in trade . Part of the Manod ( Cwt @-@ y @-@ Bugail ) mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was used to store art treasures from the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery . The number of men employed in the slate industry in North Wales dropped from 7 @,@ 589 in 1939 to 3 @,@ 520 by the end of the war . In 1945 , total production was only 70 @,@ 000 tons a year , and fewer than 20 quarries were still open compared with 40 before the war . The Nantlle Valley had been particularly hard hit , with only 350 workers employed in the entire district , compared with 1 @,@ 000 in 1937 . Demand for slate was dropping as tiles were increasingly used for roofing , and imports from countries such as Portugal , France and Italy were increasing . There was some increased demand for slates to repair bombed buildings after the end of the war , but the use of slate for new buildings was banned , apart from the smallest sizes . This ban was lifted in 1949 . 
 Total production of slate in Wales declined from 54 @,@ 000 tons in 1958 to 22 @,@ 000 tons in 1970 . The <unk> quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1955 after almost two centuries of operation . The nearby Votty and <unk> quarries closed in 1963 . In 1969 , the Dinorwig Quarry was closed , and over 300 quarrymen lost their jobs . The following year the Dorothea Quarry in the Nantlle Valley and the <unk> Slate Mine near Corris announced their closure . The Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1971 , but was later reopened by another company . By 1972 , the number of men employed in the North Wales slate industry was down to under 1 @,@ 000 . There was little alternative employment in the slate @-@ producing areas , and the closures resulted in high unemployment and a drop in population as younger people moved away to find work . In 1979 , after a long struggle , the government recognized silicosis as an industrial disease meriting compensation . There was an increase in demand for slate in the 1980s , and although this came too late for many quarries there was still some production in the Blaenau Ffestiniog area at the Oakeley , Llechwedd and Cwt @-@ y @-@ Bugail quarries , though the bulk of roofing slate production was at the Penrhyn Quarry . Further mechanization was introduced , with a computerized laser beam being used to aid the sawing of the slate blocks . 
 = = Welsh slate today = = 
 = = = Quarries still producing slate = = = 
 The Penrhyn Quarry is still producing slate , though at a much reduced capacity from its heyday at the end of the 19th century . In 1995 , it accounted for almost 50 % of UK production . It is currently owned and operated by Welsh Slate Ltd ( a subsidiary of Lagan Building Solutions ) , which also owns and carries out some operations at the Oakeley quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog , the Pen yr <unk> quarry in the Nantlle Vale , and the Cwt @-@ y @-@ Bugail quarry . In March 2010 the company announced its decision to mothball the Oakeley quarry because of subsidence at the site .

 Part of the Dinorwig Slate Quarry is now within the Padarn Country Park , and the other part houses the Dinorwig power station in caverns under the old quarry workings . The National Slate Museum is located in some of the quarry workshops . The museum has displays including Victorian slate @-@ workers ' cottages that once stood at <unk> near Blaenau Ffestiniog . As well as many exhibits , it has the multi @-@ media display To Steal a Mountain , showing the lives and work of the men who quarried slate here . The museum has the largest working water wheel in the United Kingdom , which is available for viewing via several walkways , and a restored incline formerly used to carry slate waggons uphill and downhill . 
 In Blaenau Ffestiniog , the Llechwedd Slate Caverns have been converted into a visitor attraction . Visitors can travel on the Miners ' Tramway or descend into the Deep Mine , via a funicular railway which uses an old incline , to explore this former slate mine and learn how slate was extracted and processed and about the lives of the miners . The Deep Mine , opened in 1979 , is accessed by Britain 's steepest passenger railway , with a gradient of 1 : 1 @.@ 8 or 30 ° . In the chambers , formed by slate extraction , sound and light is used to tell the story of the mine and mining . The <unk> slate mines at Corris have been converted into a tourist attraction named " King Arthur 's Labyrinth " where visitors are taken underground by boat along a subterranean river . They then walk through the caverns to see audiovisual presentations of the Arthurian legends and stories from the Mabinogion and the tales of Taliesin . The <unk> slate quarry near Machynlleth is now the site of the Centre for Alternative Technology . A number of the railways which carried the slates to the ports have been restored as tourist attractions , for example the Ffestiniog Railway and the Talyllyn Railway . 
 = = Cultural influences = = 
 The Welsh slate industry was essentially a Welsh @-@ speaking industry . Most of the workforce in the main slate @-@ producing areas of North Wales were drawn from the local area , with little immigration from outside Wales . The industry had a considerable influence on the culture of the area and on that of Wales as a whole . The <unk> , the cabin where the quarrymen gathered for their lunch break , was often the scene of wide @-@ ranging discussions , which were often formally <unk> . A surviving set of minutes from a <unk> at the Llechwedd mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog for 1908 – 10 records discussions on Church Disestablishment , tariff reform and other political topics . <unk> were held , poetry composed and discussed and most of the larger quarries had their own band , with the Oakley band particularly famous . Burn calculates that there are around fifty men judged worthy of an entry in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography who started their working lives as slate quarrymen , compared to only four owners , though obviously there was also a distinct disparity in the numbers of the two groups . 
 A number of Welsh writers have drawn on the lives of the quarrymen for their material , for example the novels of T. Rowland Hughes . <unk> , translated into English as Out of their night ( 1954 ) , has the Penrhyn Quarry dispute as a background , while Y <unk> , translated as The beginning ( 1969 ) , follows the apprenticeship of a young quarryman . Several novels by Kate Roberts , the daughter of a quarryman , give a picture of the area around <unk> , where the slate industry was on a smaller scale and many of the quarrymen were also smallholders . Her novel <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 1936 ) , translated as Feet in chains ( 2002 ) , gives a vivid picture of the struggles of a quarrying family in the period between 1880 and 1914 . Y <unk> ( " The Quarryman " ) produced in 1935 was the first Welsh @-@ language film . It showed various aspects of a slate quarryman 's life at Blaenau Ffestiniog . 
 = Ethan Allen = 
 Ethan Allen ( January 21 , 1738 [ O.S. January 10 , 1737 ] – February 12 , 1789 ) was a farmer , businessman , land speculator , philosopher , writer , lay theologian , and American Revolutionary War patriot , hero , and politician . He is best known as one of the founders of the U.S. state of Vermont , and for the capture of Fort Ticonderoga early in the American Revolutionary War along with Benedict Arnold . 
 Born in rural Connecticut , Allen had a frontier upbringing but also received an education that included some philosophical teachings . In the late 1760s he became interested in the New Hampshire Grants , buying land there and becoming embroiled in the legal disputes surrounding the territory . Legal setbacks led to the formation of the Green Mountain Boys , whom Allen led in a campaign of intimidation and property destruction to drive New York settlers from the Grants . When the American Revolutionary War broke out , Allen and the Boys seized the initiative and captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775 . In September 1775 Allen led a failed attempt on Montreal that resulted in his capture by British authorities . First imprisoned aboard Royal Navy ships , he was paroled in New York City , and finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778 . 
 Upon his release , Allen returned to the Grants , which had declared independence in 1777 , and resumed political activity in the territory . In addition to continuing resistance to New York 's attempts to assert control over the territory , Allen was active in efforts by Vermont 's leadership for recognition by Congress , and he participated in controversial negotiations with the British over the possibility of Vermont becoming a separate British province . 
 Allen wrote accounts of his exploits in the war that were widely read in the 19th century , as well as philosophical treatises and documents relating to the politics of Vermont 's formation . His business dealings included successful farming operations , one of Connecticut 's early iron works , and land speculation in the Vermont territory . Land purchased by Allen and his brothers included tracts of land that eventually became Burlington , Vermont . He was twice married , fathering eight children . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Ethan Allen was born in Litchfield , Connecticut , the first @-@ born child of Joseph and Mary Baker Allen , both of English and Puritan descent . The family moved to the town of Cornwall shortly after his birth . The move to Cornwall grew out of Allen 's father 's quest for freedom of religion during a time of turmoil : the Great Awakening , when Puritans were separating into churches with differing dogmas , in particular about the proper form of conversion : by works or by grace . His lifelong interest in philosophy and ideas emerged against the backdrop of his father 's involvement in these Puritan debates and his father 's refusal to convert to the covenant by grace . As a boy Allen already excelled at quoting the Bible and was known for disputing the meaning of passages . 
 Seven siblings , all of whom survived to adulthood , joined the family between Allen 's birth in 1738 and 1751 . His brothers Ira and Heman would also become prominent figures in the early history of Vermont . 
 Although not very much is known about Allen 's childhood , the town of Cornwall was frontier territory in the 1740s . By the time Allen reached his teens , the area , while still a difficult area in which to make a living , began to resemble a town , with wood @-@ frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers . Joseph Allen died in 1755 ; at the time of his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area , ran a successful farm , and had previously served as town selectman . Allen had , before his father 's death , begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission to Yale College . Allen 's brother Ira recalled that , even at a young age , Allen was curious and interested in learning . 
 = = = First marriage and early adulthood = = = 
 Allen was forced to end his studies upon his father 's death . While he volunteered for militia service in 1757 in response to French movements resulting in the siege of Fort William Henry , his unit received word while en route that the fort had fallen , and turned back . Even though the French and Indian War continued over the next several years , Allen did not apparently participate in any further military activities , and is presumed to have tended his farm , at least until 1762 . In that year , he became part owner of an iron furnace in Salisbury . He also married Mary Brownson , a woman five years his senior , from the nearby town of Roxbury , in July 1762 . They first settled in Cornwall , but moved the following year to Salisbury with their infant daughter Loraine . Allen bought a small farm and proceeded to develop the iron works . The expansion of the iron works was apparently costly to Allen ; he was forced to sell off portions of the Cornwall property to raise funds , and eventually sold half of his interest in the works to his brother Heman . The Allen brothers sold their interest in the iron works in October 1765 . 
 By most accounts Allen 's first marriage was an unhappy one . His wife was rigidly religious , prone to criticizing him , and barely able to read and write . In contrast , Allen 's behavior was sometimes quite flamboyant ; and he maintained an interest in learning . In spite of these differences the marriage survived until Mary 's death in 1783 . Allen and Mary had five children together , only two of whom reached adulthood . 
 Allen 's exploits in those years introduced him to the wrong side of the justice system , which would become a recurring feature of his life . In one incident , he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor , some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land , and seized the pigs . The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him ; Allen pleaded his own case , and lost . Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings , and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages . He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox , a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen . 
 = = = Thomas Young = = = 
 When he moved to Salisbury , Allen met Thomas Young , a doctor living and practicing just across the provincial boundary in New York . The doctor , only five years older than Allen , taught the younger Allen a great deal about philosophy and political theory , while Allen was able to bring to Young his appreciation of nature and life on the frontier . Young and Allen eventually decided to collaborate on a book intended to be an attack on organized religion , as Young had convinced Allen to become a Deist . They worked on the manuscript until 1764 , when Young moved away from the area , taking the manuscript with him . 
 It was not until many years later , after Young 's death , that Allen was able to recover the manuscript . He expanded and reworked the material , and eventually published it as Reason : the Only Oracle of Man . 
 = = = Moving around = = = 
 While Heman remained in Salisbury , where he ran a general store until his death in 1778 , Allen 's movements over the next few years are poorly documented . He is known to have been living in Northampton , Massachusetts in the spring of 1766 , where his son Joseph was born , and where he invested in a lead mine . He was asked to leave Northampton in July 1767 by the authorities ; while no official reason is known , biographer Michael <unk> suggests that religious differences and Allen 's tendency to be disruptive may have played a role in his departure . He then briefly returned to Salisbury before settling in nearby Sheffield , Massachusetts with his younger brother Zimri . It is likely that his first visits to the New Hampshire Grants occurred during these years . While Sheffield would be the family home for ten years , Allen was often absent for extended periods . 
 = = The New Hampshire Grants = = 
 As early as 1749 , Benning Wentworth , New Hampshire 's governor , was selling land grants in the area west of the Connecticut River , to which New Hampshire had always laid somewhat dubious claim . Many of these grants were sold at relatively low prices to land speculators , with some land kicked back to Wentworth . In 1764 , King George issued an order resolving the competing claims of New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York . New York , which had also issued land grants that overlapped some of those sold by Wentworth , insisted that holders of the Wentworth grants pay a fee to New York to have their grants validated . As this fee approached the original purchase price , and many of the holders were land @-@ rich and cash @-@ poor , there was a great deal of resistance to this demand . By 1769 the situation in the Grants had deteriorated to the point where surveyors and other figures of New York authority were being physically threatened and driven from the area . 
 = = = Allen asked for assistance = = = 
 A few of the holders of Wentworth grants were originally from northwestern Connecticut ; and some of them , including Remember Baker and Seth Warner , were relatives of Allen . In 1770 , a group of Wentworth grant holders asked Allen to defend their case before New York 's Supreme Court , a move that presented Allen with his first big stage . This move to leadership was not unusual ; he was known among his contemporaries to be willing to step forward and take control . The trial , for which Allen hired Jared Ingersoll to represent the <unk> interest , began in July 1770 , pitting Allen against politically powerful New York grant @-@ holders , including New York 's Lieutenant Governor Colden , James Duane ( who was prosecuting the case ) , and Robert Livingston , the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court ( who was presiding over the case ) . The trial was brief , and the outcome unsurprising , as the court , citing their fraudulently issued nature , refused to allow the introduction of Wentworth 's grants as evidence . Before departing for Bennington with the news , Allen was visited by Duane , who offered Allen payments which Duane described in his diary as payment " for going among the people to quiet them " . Allen denied taking any money ; even if he did , none of his actions appeared to honor Duane 's request . According to Allen 's account he was outraged , and left his visitors with veiled threats , indicating that attempts to enforce the judgment would be met with resistance . 
 While many historians have believed that Allen took these actions because he already held Wentworth grants of his own , there is no evidence that he was issued any such grants until after he had been asked to take up the defense of grants held by others . Between May 1770 , when he first began working on the defense , and the trial in July , he acquired , for the price of $ 50 , grants from Wentworth to about 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 400 ha ) of land in Poultney and Castleton . 
 = = = Green Mountain Boys = = = 
 On Allen 's return to Bennington , the settlers met at the Catamount Tavern to discuss their options . These discussions resulted in the formation of the Green Mountain Boys , with local militia companies in each of the surrounding towns . Allen was named their Colonel Commandant , and cousins Seth Warner and Remember Baker were captains of two of the companies . Further meetings resulted in the creation of committees of safety , and laid down rules by which to resist attempts by the New York provincial government to establish its authority . These included denying surveyors sent by the province the ability to survey any land in the Grants , not just land owned through the Wentworth grants . 
 While Allen participated in some of the actions to drive surveyors away , he also spent much time exploring the entire territory , probably ranging as far north as the site of Burlington in his wanderings . After selling off some of his Connecticut properties , he began buying wild lands further north in the territory , which he sold at a profit as the southern settlements grew and people began to move further north . 
 Friction with the provincial government rose notably when , in October 1771 , Allen and a company of Boys drove off a group of Scottish settlers near Rupert . Allen detained two of the settlers and forced them to watch the torching of their newly constructed cabins . He then ordered them to leave , saying , " Go your way now , and complain to that damned scoundrel your Governor , God damn your Governor , Laws , King , Council , and Assembly " . When the settlers protested his language Allen continued the tirade , threatening to send any troops from New York to Hell . In response , New York 's governor , William Tryon , issued warrants for the arrests of those responsible , and eventually put a price of £ 20 on the heads of six participants , including Allen . Allen and his comrades countered by issuing offers of their own . 
 Over the next few years the situation deteriorated further . Governor Tryon and the Boys exchanged threats , truce offers , and other writings , which were frequently written by Allen in florid and didactic language , while the Boys continued to drive surveyors and incoming tenants on New York @-@ granted lands away . Most of these incidents did not involve bloodshed , although individuals were at times manhandled , and the Boys sometimes did extensive property damage when driving tenants out . By March 1774 , the harsh treatment of settlers and their property by Allen and the Boys prompted Tryon to increase some of the rewards to £ 100 . 
 = = = Onion River Company = = = 
 Allen persisted with actions against the New York @-@ issued <unk> and their tenants even though a number of the Wentworth proprietors were tiring of the business . In 1772 he ; his cousin Remember Baker ; and his brothers Ira , Heman , and Zimri formed the Onion River Company , which was basically a land @-@ speculation organization devoted to purchasing land in and around the Winooski River ( known then as the Onion River ) . The success of this business depended on the successful defense of the Wentworth grants . Early purchases of the company included about 40 @,@ 000 acres ( 16 @,@ 000 ha ) of land from Edward Burling and his partners ; land was sold at a profit to Thomas Chittenden among others , and the settlements on the company 's land have grown to become the city of Burlington . 
 The outrage of the Wentworth proprietors was renewed in 1774 when Governor Tryon passed a law containing harsh provisions clearly targeted at the actions of the " Bennington Mob " . Vermont historian Samuel Williams called it " an act which for its savage barbarity is probably without parallel in the legislation of any civilized country " . Its provisions included the penalty of death for interfering with a magistrate , and the criminalization of meetings of more than three people " for unlawful purposes " in the Grants . The Boys countered with rules of their own , forbidding anyone in the Grants from holding " any office of honor or profit under the colony of N. York " . 
 Allen spent much of the summer of 1774 writing a " pamphlet " entitled A Brief Narrative of the Proceedings of the Government of New York Relative to Their Obtaining the Jurisdiction of that Large District of Land to the Westward of the Connecticut River . The length of the name was justified ; it was a 200 @-@ page polemic arguing the position of the Wentworth proprietors . Allen had the work , which historian Charles <unk> describes as " rebellion in print " , printed in Connecticut , and began selling and giving away copies in early 1775 . 
 = = = Westminster massacre = = = 
 Allen traveled into the northern parts of the Grants early in 1775 , as was his custom , for solitude and to hunt for game and land opportunities . A few days after his return , news came that blood had finally been shed over the land disputes . Most of the resistance activity had until then taken place on the west side of the Green Mountains ; on March 13 , a small riot in the shire town of Westminster , on the east side of the mountains , resulted in the death of two men . Allen and a troop of Boys traveled to Westminster where , under Allen 's influence , the town 's convention adopted a strongly worded resolution authorizing the drafting of a plea to the King to remove them " out of so oppressive a jurisdiction " . The preparation of the petition was assigned to a committee which included Allen . Less than a week after the Westminster convention ended , while Allen and the committee worked on their petition , the American Revolutionary War began .

 = = = Capture of Fort Ticonderoga = = = 
 In late April , following the battles of Lexington and Concord , Allen received a message from members of an irregular Connecticut militia that they were planning to capture Fort Ticonderoga , requesting his assistance in the effort . Allen , whether motivated by patriotic impulses ( as he describes in his account of the events ) , or by the realization that the action might improve the political position of his side in the grants disputes , agreed to help , and began rounding up the Green Mountain Boys . On May 2 , 60 men from Massachusetts and Connecticut met with Allen in Bennington , where they discussed the logistics of the expedition . By May 7 , these men joined Allen and 130 Boys at Castleton . The next morning , Allen was elected to lead the expedition , and a dawn raid was planned for May 10 . Two small companies were detached to procure boats , and Allen took the main contingent north to Hand 's Cove in Shoreham to prepare for the crossing . 
 On the afternoon of May 9 , Benedict Arnold quite unexpectedly arrived on the scene . <unk> a commission from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety , he asserted his right to command the expedition . The assembled men refused to acknowledge his authority , insisting they would only follow Allen 's lead . In a private discussion , Allen and Arnold reached an accommodation , the essence of which was that Arnold and Allen would both be at the front of the troops when the attack on the fort was made . 
 Around 2 : 00 a.m. , a few boats were finally procured for the crossing . However , only 83 men made it to the other side of the lake before Allen and Arnold , concerned that dawn was approaching , decided to attack . In the early dawn , the small force marched on the fort , surprising the lone sentry . Allen went directly to the fort commander 's quarters , seeking to force his surrender . Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham , the assistant to the fort 's commander , Captain William Delaplace , was awakened by the noise , and called to wake the captain . Stalling for time , he demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered . Allen , who later claimed that he said it to Captain Delaplace , said , " In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress ! " Delaplace finally emerged from his chambers , fully dressed , and surrendered his sword . The rest of the fort 's garrison surrendered without firing a shot . 
 = = = Raids on St. John = = = 
 A detachment of the boys under Seth Warner 's command went to nearby Fort Crown Point and captured the small garrison there . On May 14 , following the arrival of 100 men recruited by Arnold 's captains , and the arrival of a schooner and some bateaux that had been taken at Skenesboro , Arnold and 50 of his men sailed north to raid Fort St. John , on the Richelieu River downstream from the lake , where a small British warship was reported by the prisoners to be anchored . Arnold 's raid was a success ; he seized the sloop HMS Royal George , supplies , and a number of bateaux . 
 Allen , shortly after Arnold 's departure on the raid , decided , after his successes at the southern end of the lake , to take and hold Fort St. John himself . To that end , he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux , and began rowing north . After two days without significant food ( which they had forgotten to provision in the boats ) , Allen 's small fleet met Arnold 's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake . Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen 's hungry men , and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective , noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John . Allen , likely both stubborn in his determination , and envious of Arnold , persisted . 
 When Allen and his men landed above St. John and scouted the situation , they learned that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching . Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops , which significantly outnumbered his tired company , Allen withdrew to the other side of the river , where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night . They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river . The Boys , in a panic , piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver . When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later , some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took . 
 = = = Promoting an invasion = = = 
 Following Allen 's failed attempt on St. John , many of his men drifted away , presumably drawn by the needs of home and farm . Arnold then began asserting his authority over Allen for control of Ticonderoga and Crown Point . Allen publicly announced that he was stepping down as commander , but remained hopeful that the Second Continental Congress was going to name " a commander for this department ... Undoubtedly , we shall be rewarded according to our merit " . Congress , for its part , at first not really wanting any part of the affair , effectively voted to strip and then abandon the forts . Both Allen and Arnold protested these measures , pointing out that doing so would leave the northern border wide open . They both also made proposals to Congress and other provincial bodies for carrying out an invasion of Quebec . Allen , in one instance , wrote that " I will lay my life on it , that with fifteen hundred men , and a proper artillery , I will take Montreal " . Allen also attempted correspondence with the people of Quebec and with the Indians living there in an attempt to sway their opinion toward the revolutionary cause . 
 On June 22 , Allen and Seth Warner appeared before Congress in Philadelphia , where they argued for the inclusion of the Green Mountain Boys in the Continental Army . After deliberation , Congress directed General Philip Schuyler , who had been appointed to lead the Army 's Northern Department , to work with New York 's provincial government to establish ( and pay for ) a regiment consisting of the Boys , and that they be paid Army rates for their service at Ticonderoga . On July 4 , Allen and Warner made their case to New York 's Provincial Congress , which , despite the fact that the Royal Governor had placed a price on their heads , agreed to the formation of a regiment . Following a brief visit to their families , they returned to Bennington to spread the news . Allen went to Ticonderoga to join Schuyler , while Warner and others raised the regiment . 
 = = = Allen loses command of the Boys = = = 
 When the regimental companies in the Grants had been raised , they held a vote in Dorset to determine who would command the regiment . By a wide margin , Seth Warner was elected to lead the regiment . Brothers Ira and Heman were also given command positions , but Allen was not given any position at all in the regiment . The thorough rejection stung ; Allen wrote to Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull , " How the old men came to reject me I cannot conceive inasmuch as I saved them from the <unk> of New York . " 
 The rejection likely had several causes . The people of the Grants were tired of the disputes with New York , and they were tired of Allen 's posturing and egotistic behavior , which the success at Ticonderoga had enhanced . Finally , the failure of the attempt on St. John 's was widely seen as reckless and ill @-@ advised , attributes they did not appreciate in a regimental leader . Warner was viewed as a more stable and quieter choice , and was someone that also commanded respect . The history of Warner 's later actions in the revolution ( notably at Hubbardton and Bennington ) may be seen as a confirmation of the choice made by the Dorset meeting . In the end , Allen took the rejection in stride , and managed to convince Schuyler and Warner to permit him to accompany the regiment as a civilian scout . 
 = = = Capture = = = 
 The American invasion of Quebec departed from Ticonderoga on August 28 . On September 4 , the army had occupied the Île aux Noix in the Richelieu River , a few miles above Fort St. John , which they then prepared to besiege . On September 8 , Schuyler sent Allen and Massachusetts Major John Brown , who had also been involved in the capture of Ticonderoga , into the countryside between St. John and Montreal to spread the word of their arrival to the habitants and the Indians . They were successful enough in gaining support from the habitants that Quebec 's governor , General Guy Carleton , reported that " they have injured us very much " . 
 When he returned from that expedition eight days later , Brigadier General Richard Montgomery had assumed command of the invasion due to Schuyler 's illness . Montgomery , likely not wanting the troublemaker in his camp , again sent him out , this time to raise a regiment of French @-@ speaking Canadiens . Accompanied by a small number of Americans , he again set out , traveling through the countryside to Sorel , before turning to follow the Saint Lawrence River up toward Montreal , recruiting upwards of 200 men . 
 On September 24 , he and Brown , whose company was guarding the road between St. John 's and Montreal , met at Longueuil , and , according to Allen 's account of the events , came up with a plan in which both he and Brown would lead their forces to attack Montreal . Allen and about 100 men crossed the Saint Lawrence that night , but Brown and his men , who were to cross the river at <unk> , did not . General Carleton , alerted to Allen 's presence , mustered every man he could , and , in the Battle of Longue @-@ Pointe , scattered most of Allen 's force , and captured him and about 30 men . His capture ended his participation in the revolution until 1778 , as he was imprisoned by the British . General Schuyler , upon learning of Allen 's capture , wrote , " I am very apprehensive of disagreeable consequences arising from Mr. Allen 's imprudence . I always dreaded his impatience and imprudence . " 
 = = Imprisonment = = 
 Much of what is known of Allen 's captivity is known only from his own account of the time ; where contemporary records are available , they tend to confirm those aspects of his story . 
 Allen was first placed aboard HMS Gaspée , a brig anchored at Montreal . He was kept in solitary confinement and chains , and General Richard Prescott had , according to Allen , ordered him to be treated " with much severity " . In October 1775 , the Gaspée went downriver , and her prisoners were transferred to the Adamant , which then sailed for England . Allen wrote of the voyage that he " was put under the power of an English Merchant from London , whose name was Brook Watson : a man of malicious and cruel disposition " . 
 On arrival at Falmouth , England , after a crossing under filthy conditions , Allen and the other prisoners were imprisoned in Pendennis Castle , Cornwall . At first his treatment was poor , but Allen wrote a letter , ostensibly to the Continental Congress , describing his conditions and suggesting that Congress treat the prisoners it held the same way . Unknown to Allen , British prisoners now included General Prescott , captured trying to escape from Montreal , and the letter came into the hands of the British cabinet . Also faced with opposition within the British establishment to the treatment of captives taken in North America , King George decreed that the men should be sent back to America and treated as prisoners of war . 
 In January 1776 , Allen and his men were put on board HMS Soledad , which sailed for Cork , Ireland . The people of Cork , when they learned that the famous Ethan Allen was in port , took up a collection to provide him and his men with clothing and other supplies . Much of the following year was spent on prison ships off the American coast . At one point , while aboard HMS Mercury , she anchored off New York , where , among other visitors , the captain entertained William Tryon ; Allen reports that Tryon glanced at him without any sign of recognition , although it is likely the New York governor knew who he was . In August 1776 , Allen and other prisoners were temporarily put ashore in Halifax , owing to extremely poor conditions aboard ship ; due to food scarcity , both crew and prisoners were on short rations , and scurvy was rampant . By the end of October , Allen was again off New York , where the British , having secured the city , moved the prisoners on @-@ shore , and , as he was considered an officer , gave Allen limited parole . With the financial assistance of his brother Ira , he lived comfortably , if out of action , until August 1777 . He then learned of the death of his young son Joseph due to smallpox . 
 According to another prisoner 's account , Allen wandered off after learning of his son 's death . He was arrested for violating his parole , and placed in solitary confinement . There he remained while Vermont declared independence , and John Burgoyne 's campaign for the Hudson River met a stumbling block near Bennington in August 1777 . On May 3 , 1778 he was transferred to Staten Island . He was admitted to General John Campbell 's quarters , where he was invited to eat and drink with the general and several other British field officers . Allen stayed there for two days and was treated politely . On the third day Allen was exchanged for Colonel Archibald Campbell , who was conducted to the exchange by Colonel Elias Boudinot , the American commissary general of prisoners appointed by General George Washington . Following the exchange , Allen reported to Washington at Valley Forge . On May 14 , he was breveted a colonel in the Continental Army in " reward of his fortitude , firmness and zeal in the cause of his country , manifested during his long and cruel captivity , as well as on former occasions , " and given military pay of $ 75 per month . The brevet rank , however , meant that there was no active role , until called , for Allen . Allen 's services were never requested , and eventually the payments stopped .

 Following his visit to Valley Forge , Allen traveled to Salisbury , arriving on May 25 , 1778 . There he learned that his brother Heman had died just the previous week , and that his brother Zimri , who had been caring for Allen 's family and farm , had died in the spring following his capture . The death of Heman , with whom Allen had been quite close , hit him quite hard . 
 He then set out for Bennington , where news of his impending return preceded him , and he was met with all of the honor due a military war hero . There he learned that the Vermont Republic had declared independence in 1777 , that a constitution had been drawn up , and that elections had been held . Allen wrote of this homecoming that " we passed the flowing bowl , and rural felicity , sweetened with friendship , glowed in every countenance " . The next day he went to Arlington to see his family and his brother Ira , whose prominence in Vermont politics had risen considerably during Allen 's captivity .

While his family remained in Arlington , he spent most of his time either in Bennington or on the road , where he could avoid his wife 's nagging . Shortly after his arrival , Vermont 's Assembly passed the <unk> Act , a sweeping measure allowing for the confiscation and auction by the republic of property owned by known Tories . Allen was appointed to be one of the judges responsible for deciding whose property was subject to seizure under the law . ( This law was so successful at collecting revenue that Vermont did not impose any taxes until 1781 . ) Allen personally escorted some of those convicted under the law to Albany , where he turned them over to General John Stark for transportation to the British lines . Some of these supposed Tories protested to New York Governor George Clinton that they were actually dispossessed Yorkers . Clinton , who considered Vermont to still be a part of New York , did not want to honor the actions of the Vermont tribunals ; Stark , who had custody of the men , disagreed with Clinton . Eventually the dispute made its way to George Washington , who essentially agreed with Stark since he desperately needed the general 's services . The prisoners were eventually transported to West Point , where they remained in " easy imprisonment " . 
 While Allen 's service as a judge in Vermont was brief , he continued to ferret out Tories and report them to local Boards of Confiscation for action . He was so zealous in these efforts that they also included naming his own brother Levi , who was apparently trying to swindle Allen and Ira out of land at the time . This action was somewhat surprising , as Levi had not only attempted to purchase Allen 's release while he was in Halifax , but he had also traveled to New York while Allen was on parole there , and furnished him with goods and money . Allen and Levi engaged in a war of words , many of which were printed in the Connecticut Courant , even after Levi crossed British lines . They would eventually reconcile in 1783 . 
 Early in 1779 , Governor Clinton issued a proclamation stating that the state of New York would honor the Wentworth grants , if the settlers would recognize New York 's political jurisdiction over the Vermont territory . Allen wrote another pamphlet in response , entitled An <unk> [ sic ] Address to the Inhabitants of the State of Vermont ; with Remarks on a Proclamation under the Hand of his Excellency George Clinton , Esq ; Governor of the State of New York . In typical style , he castigated the governor for issuing " romantic proclamations ... calculated to deceive woods people " , and for his " folly and stupidity " . Clinton 's response , once he recovered his temper , was to issue another proclamation little different from the first . Allen 's pamphlet circulated widely , including among members of Congress , and was successful in casting the Vermonters ' case in a positive light . 
 In 1779 Allen published the account of his time in captivity , A Narrative of Colonel Ethan Allen 's Captivity ... Containing His Voyages and Travels , With the most remarkable Occurrences respecting him and many other Continental Prisoners of Observations . Written by Himself and now published for the Information of the Curious in all Nations . First published as a serial by the Pennsylvania Packet , the book was an instant best @-@ seller ; it is still available today . While largely accurate , it notably omits Benedict Arnold from the capture of Ticonderoga , and Seth Warner as the leader of the Green Mountain Boys . 
 = = = Negotiations with the British = = = 
 Allen appeared before the Continental Congress as early as September 1778 on behalf of Vermont , seeking recognition as an independent state . He reported that due to Vermont 's expansion to include border towns from New Hampshire , Congress was reluctant to grant independent statehood to Vermont . Between 1780 and 1783 Allen participated , along with his brother Ira , Vermont Governor Thomas Chittenden , and others , in negotiations with Frederick Haldimand , the governor of Quebec , that were ostensibly about prisoner exchanges , but were really about establishing Vermont as a new British province and gaining military protection for its residents . The negotiations , once details of them were published , were often described by opponents of Vermont statehood as treasonous , but no such formal charges were ever laid against anyone involved . 
 = = Later years = = 
 As the war had ended with the 1783 Treaty of Paris , and the United States , operating under the Articles of Confederation , resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont , Allen 's historic role as an agitator became less important , and his public role in Vermont 's affairs declined . Vermont 's government had also become more than a clique dominated by the Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory 's rapid population growth . 
 In 1782 , Allen 's brother Heber died at the relatively young age of 38 . Allen 's wife Mary died in June 1783 of consumption , to be followed several months later by their first @-@ born daughter Loraine . While they had not always been close , and Allen 's marriage had often been strained , Allen felt these losses deeply . A poem he wrote memorializing Mary was published in the Bennington Gazette . 
 = = = Publication of Reason = = = 
 In these years he recovered the manuscript that he and Thomas Young had worked in his youth from Young 's widow , who was living in Albany , and began to develop it into the work that was published in 1785 as Reason : the Only Oracle of Man . The work was a typical Allen polemic , but its target was religious , not political . Specifically targeted against Christianity , it was an unbridled attack against the Bible , established churches , and the powers of the priesthood . As a replacement for organized religion , he espoused a mixture of deism , Spinoza 's naturalist views , and precursors of Transcendentalism , with man acting as a free agent within the natural world . While historians disagree over the exact authorship of the work , the writing contains clear indications of Allen 's style . 
 The book was a complete financial and critical failure . Allen 's publisher had forced him to pay the publication costs up front , and only 200 of the 1 @,@ 500 volumes printed were sold . ( The rest were eventually destroyed by a fire at the publisher 's house . ) The theologically conservative future president of Yale , Timothy Dwight , opined that " the style was crude and vulgar , and the sentiments were coarser than the style . The arguments were flimsy and unmeaning , and the conclusions were fastened upon the premises by mere force . " Allen took the financial loss and the criticism in stride , observing that most of the critics were clergymen , whose livelihood he was attacking . 
 = = = Second marriage = = = 
 Allen met his second wife , a young widow named Frances " Fanny " Montresor Brush Buchanan , early in 1784 ; and after a brief courtship , they wed on February 16 , 1784 . Fanny came from a notably Loyalist background ( including Crean Brush , notorious for acts during the Siege of Boston , from whom she inherited land in Vermont ) , but they were both smitten , and the marriage was a happy one . They had three children : Fanny ( 1784 – 1819 ) , Hannibal Montresor ( 1786 – 1813 ) , and Ethan Alphonso ( 1789 – 1855 ) . Fanny had a settling effect on Allen ; for the remainder of his years he did not embark on many great adventures . 
 The notable exception to this was when land claims by the Connecticut @-@ based owners of the Susquehanna Company , who had been granted titles to land claimed by Connecticut in the Wyoming Valley , in an area that is now Wilkes @-@ Barre , Pennsylvania . The area was also claimed by Pennsylvania , which refused to recognize the Connecticut titles . Allen , after being promised land , traveled to the area and began stirring up not just Pennsylvania authorities but also his long @-@ time nemesis , Governor Clinton of New York , by proposing that a new state be carved out of the disputed area and several counties of New York . The entire affair was more bluster than anything else , and was resolved amicably when Pennsylvania agreed to honor the Connecticut titles . 
 Allen was also approached by Daniel Shays in 1786 for support in what became the Shays 's Rebellion in western Massachusetts . He was unsupportive of the cause , in spite of Shays 's offer to crown him " king of Massachusetts " ; he felt that Shays was just trying to erase unpayable debts . 
 In his later years , independent Vermont continued to experience rapid population growth , and Allen sold a great deal of his land , but also reinvested much the proceeds in more land . A lack of cash , complicated by Vermont 's currency problems , placed a strain on Fanny 's relatively free hand on spending , which was further exacerbated by the cost of publishing Reason , and of the construction of a new home near the mouth of the Onion River . He was threatened with debtors ' prison on at least one occasion , and was at times reduced to borrowing money and calling in old debts to make ends meet . 
 Allen and his family moved to Burlington in 1787 , which was no longer a small frontier settlement but a small town , and much more to Allen 's liking than the larger community that Bennington had become . He frequented the tavern there , and began work on An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being , which he characterized as an appendix to Reason . This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings . He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation , and credited intuition as well as reason as a way to bring Man closer to the universe . The work was not published until long after his death , and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism , a movement the work foreshadows . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 On February 11 , 1789 , Allen traveled to South Hero , Vermont with one of his workers to visit his cousin , Ebenezer Allen , and to collect a load of hay . After an evening spent with friends and acquaintances , he spent the night there , and set out the next morning for home . While accounts of the return journey are not entirely consistent , Allen apparently suffered an apoplectic fit en route , and was unconscious by the time they returned home . Allen died at home several hours later , without ever regaining consciousness . He was buried four days later in the Green Mount Cemetery in Burlington . The funeral was attended by dignitaries from the Vermont government , and by large numbers of common folk who turned out to pay respects to a man many considered their champion . 
 Allen 's death made nationwide headlines . The Bennington Gazette wrote of the local hero , " the patriotism and strong attachment which ever appeared uniform in the breast of this Great Man , was worth of his exalted character ; the public have to lament the loss of a man who has rendered them great service " . Although most obituaries were positive , a number of clergymen expressed different sentiments . " Allen was an ignorant and profane Deist , who died with a mind replete with horror and despair " was the opinion of Newark , New Jersey 's Reverend Uzal Ogden . Yale 's Timothy Dwight expressed satisfaction that the world no longer had to deal with a man of " <unk> and effrontery , rudeness and ribaldry " . It is not recorded what New York Governor Clinton 's reaction was to the news . 
 = = Family = = 
 Allen 's widow Fanny gave birth to a son , Ethan Alphonso , on October 24 , 1789 . She eventually remarried . Allen 's two youngest sons went on to graduate from West Point and serve in the United States Army . His daughter Fanny achieved notice when she converted to Roman Catholicism and entered a convent . His grandson , Ethan Allen Hitchcock , served as a Union Army general in the American Civil War , and was claimed by his mother to bear a strong resemblance to her father . 
 Disappearance of his grave marker 
 Sometime in the early 1850s , the original plaque marking Allen 's grave disappeared ; its original text was preserved by early war historian Benson Lossing in the 1840s . In 1858 , the Vermont Legislature authorized the placement of a 42 @-@ foot ( 13 m ) column of Vermont granite in the cemetery , with the following inscription : 
 The exact location within the cemetery of his remains is unknown . While there is a vault beneath the 1858 cenotaph , it contains a time capsule from the time of the monument 's erection .

 No likenesses of Allen made from life have been found , in spite of numerous attempts to locate them . Efforts by members of the Vermont Historical Society and other historical groups through the years have followed up on rumored likenesses , only to come up empty . Photographs of his grandson , General Ethan Allen Hitchcock , are extant , and , of course , Hitchcock 's mother said that he resembled Allen . The nearest potential images included one claimed to be by noted Revolutionary War era engraver Pierre Eugene du <unk> that turned out to be a forgery , and a reference to a portrait possibly by Ralph Earl that has not been found ( as of Stewart Holbrook 's writing in 1940 ) . Alexander Graydon , with whom Allen was paroled during his captivity in New York , described him like this : 
 " His figure was that of a robust , large @-@ framed man , worn down by confinement and hard fare ; but he was now recovering his flesh and spirits ; and a suit of blue clothes , with a gold laced hat that had been presented to him by the <unk> of Cork , enabled him to make a very passable appearance for a rebel colonel ... I have seldom met with a man , possessing , in my opinion , a stronger mind , or whose mode of expression was more vehement and oratorical . Notwithstanding that Allen might have had something of the insubordinate , lawless frontier spirit in his composition ... he appeared to me to be a man of generosity and honor . "

 Allen 's final home , on the Onion River ( now called the Winooski River ) , is a part of the Ethan Allen Homestead and Museum . Situated in Burlington , Allen 's homestead is available for viewing via guided tours . 
 Two ships of the United States Navy were named USS Ethan Allen in his honor , as were two 19th @-@ century fortifications : a Civil War fort in Arlington , Virginia and a cavalry outpost in Colchester and Essex , Vermont . A statue of Allen represents Vermont in National Statuary Hall of the United States Capitol . A city park in the Montreal borough of Mercier @-@ Hochelaga @-@ Maisonneuve commemorating his capture bears his name . 
 The Spirit of Ethan Allen III is a tour boat operating on Lake Champlain . Allen 's name is the trademark of the furniture and housewares manufacturer , Ethan Allen Inc . , which was founded in 1932 in Beecher Falls , Vermont . The Ethan Allen Express , an Amtrak train line running from New York City to Rutland , Vermont , is also named after him . 
 The Ethan Allen School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 .

 = Grand Coulee Dam = 
 Grand Coulee Dam is a gravity dam on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington , built to produce hydroelectric power and provide irrigation water . It was constructed between 1933 and 1942 , originally with two power plants . A third power station was completed in 1974 to increase its energy production . It is the largest electric power @-@ producing facility in the United States . 
 The proposal to build the dam was the focus of a bitter debate during the 1920s between two groups . One group wanted to irrigate the ancient Grand Coulee with a gravity canal , and the other supported a high dam and pumping scheme . Dam supporters won in 1933 , but for fiscal reasons the initial design was for a " low dam " 290 feet ( 88 m ) high which would generate electricity , but not support irrigation . The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and a consortium of three companies called MWAK ( Mason @-@ Walsh @-@ Atkinson Kier Company ) began construction that year . After visiting the construction site in August 1934 , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt began endorsing the " high dam " design which , at 550 ft ( 168 m ) high , would provide enough electricity to pump water to irrigate the Columbia Basin . The high dam was approved by Congress in 1935 and completed in 1942 ; the first water over @-@ topped its spillway on June 1 of that year . 
 Power from the dam fueled the growing industries of the Northwest United States during World War II . Between 1967 and 1974 , the third powerplant was constructed . The decision to construct the additional facility was influenced by growing energy demand , regulated river flows stipulated in the Columbia River Treaty with Canada , and competition with the Soviet Union . Through a series of upgrades and the installation of pump @-@ generators , the dam now supplies four power stations with an installed capacity of 6 @,@ 809 MW . As the center @-@ piece of the Columbia Basin Project , the dam 's reservoir supplies water for the irrigation of 671 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 700 km2 ) . 
 The reservoir is called Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake , named after the United States President who presided over the authorization and completion of the dam . Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3 @,@ 000 people , including Native Americans whose ancestral lands were partially flooded . The dam has also blocked the migration of salmon and other fish upstream to spawn . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Grand Coulee is an ancient river bed on the Columbia Plateau created during the Pliocene Epoch ( Calabrian ) by retreating glaciers and floods . Originally , geologists believed the Grand Coulee was formed by a glacier diverting the Columbia River but it was revealed in the mid @-@ late 20th century that massive floods from Lake Missoula carved most of the gorge . The earliest known proposal to irrigate the Grand Coulee with the Columbia River dates to 1892 , when the Coulee City News and The Spokesman Review reported on a scheme by a man named Laughlin McLean to construct a 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 305 m ) dam across the Columbia River , high enough that water would back up into the Grand Coulee . A dam that size would have its reservoir encroach into Canada , which would violate treaties . Shortly after the Bureau of Reclamation was founded , it investigated a scheme for pumping water from the Columbia River to irrigate parts of central Washington . An attempt to raise funds for irrigation failed in 1914 , as a bond measure was rejected by Washington voters . 
 A lawyer from Ephrata , Washington , named William M. Clapp proposed in 1917 that the Columbia be dammed immediately below the Grand Coulee . He suggested a concrete dam could flood the plateau , just as nature blocked it with ice centuries ago . Clapp was joined by James O 'Sullivan , another lawyer , and by Rufus Woods , publisher of the Wenatchee World newspaper . Together , they became known as the " Dam College " . Woods began promoting the Grand Coulee Dam in his newspaper , often with articles written by O 'Sullivan . The dam idea gained popularity with the public in 1918 . Backers of reclamation in Central Washington split into two camps . One side , known as the " pumpers " , favored a dam with pumps to elevate water from the river into the Grand Coulee from which canals and pipes could be used to irrigate farmland . The other side , known as the " ditchers " , favored diverting water from northeast Washington 's Pend Oreille River via a gravity canal to irrigate farmland in Central and Eastern Washington . Many locals such as Woods , O 'Sullivan and Clapp were pumpers , while many influential businessmen in Spokane associated with the Washington Water and Power Company ( WWPC ) were staunch ditchers . The pumpers argued that hydroelectricity from the dam could be used to cover costs and claimed the ditchers sought to maintain a monopoly on electric power . 
 The ditchers took a number of steps to ensure support for their proposals . In 1921 , WWPC secured a preliminary permit to build a dam at Kettle Falls , about 110 mi ( 177 km ) upstream from the Grand Coulee . If built , the Kettle Falls Dam would have lain in the path of the Grand Coulee Dam 's reservoir , essentially blocking its construction . WWPC planted rumors in the newspapers , incorrectly stating that exploratory drilling at the Grand Coulee site found no granite on which a dam 's foundations could rest , only clay and fragmented rock . This was later disproved with Reclamation @-@ ordered drilling . <unk> hired General George W. Goethals , engineer of the Panama Canal , to prepare a report . Goethals visited the state and produced a report backing the ditchers . The Bureau of Reclamation was unimpressed by Goethals ' report , believing it filled with errors . In July 1923 , President Warren G. Harding visited Washington state and expressed support for irrigation work there , but died a month later . His successor , Calvin Coolidge , had little interest in irrigation projects . The Bureau of Reclamation , desirous of a major project that would bolster its reputation , was focusing on the Boulder Canyon Project that resulted in the Hoover Dam . Reclamation was authorized to conduct a study in 1923 , but the project 's cost made federal officials reluctant . The Washington state proposals received little support from those further east , who feared the irrigation would result in more crops , depressing prices . With President Coolidge opposed to the project , bills to appropriate money for surveys of the Grand Coulee site failed . 
 In 1925 , Congress authorized a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study of the Columbia River . This study was included in the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 1925 , which provided for studies on the navigation , power , flood control and irrigation potential of rivers . In April 1926 , the Army Corps responded with the first of the " 308 Reports " named after the 1925 House Document No. 308 ( 69th Congress , 1st Session ) . With the help of Washington 's Senators , Wesley Jones and Clarence Dill , Congress ordered $ 600 @,@ 000 in further studies to be carried out by the Army Corps and Federal Power Commission on the Columbia River Basin and Snake Rivers . U.S. Army Major John Butler was responsible for the upper Columbia River and Snake River and in 1932 , his 1 @,@ 000 @-@ page report was submitted to Congress . It recommended the Grand Coulee Dam and nine others on the river , including some in Canada . The report stated that electricity sales from the Grand Coulee Dam could pay for construction costs . Reclamation — whose interest in the dam was revitalized by the report — endorsed it . 
 Although there was some support for the Grand Coulee Dam , others argued there was little need for more electricity in the Northwest and crops were in surplus . The Army Corps did not believe construction should be a federal project and saw low demand for electricity . Reclamation argued that energy demand would rise by the time the dam was complete . The head of Reclamation , Elwood Mead , stated he wanted the dam built no matter the cost . President Franklin D. Roosevelt , who took office in March , 1933 , supported the dam because of its irrigation potential and the power it would provide , but he was uneasy with its $ 450 million price tag . For this reason , he supported a 290 ft ( 88 m ) " low dam " instead of the 550 ft ( 168 m ) " high dam " . He provided $ 63 million in federal funding , while Washington State provided $ 377 @,@ 000 . In 1933 , Washington governor Clarence Martin set up the Columbia Basin Commission to oversee the dam project , and Reclamation was selected to oversee construction . 
 = = Construction = = 
 = = = Low dam = = = 
 On July 16 , 1933 , a crowd of 3 @,@ 000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low dam site , and excavation soon began . Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam . It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity , though at a reduced capacity . Most importantly , it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee . However , the dam 's design provided for future raising and upgrading . 
 Before and during construction , workers and engineers experienced problems . Contracts for companies to construct the various parts of the dam were difficult to award as few companies were sizable enough to fill them . This forced companies to consolidate . In addition , Native American graves had to be relocated and temporary fish ladders had to be constructed . During construction additional problems included landslides and the need to protect newly poured concrete from freezing . Construction on the downstream Grand Coulee Bridge began in May 1934 and more considerable earth @-@ moving began in August . Excavation for the dam 's foundation required the removal of 22 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cu yd ( 17 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of dirt and stone . To reduce the amount of trucking required in the excavation , a conveyor belt nearly 2 mi ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) long was built . To further secure the foundation , workers drilled 660 – 880 ft ( 200 – 270 m ) holes into the granite and filled any fissures with grout , creating a grout curtain . At times , excavated areas collapsed from overburden . In order to secure these areas from further movement and continue excavation , 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) diameter pipes were inserted into the mass and chilled with cold liquid from a refrigeration plant . This froze the earth and secured it so construction could continue . 
 Final contract bidding for the dam began June 18 , 1934 , in Spokane , and four bids were submitted . One bid was from a lawyer with no financial backing ; another was from actress Mae West which consisted of nothing more than a poem and promise to divert the river . Of the two serious bids , the lowest bid was from a consortium of three companies : Silas Mason Co. from Louisville , Kentucky , Walsh Construction Co. of Davenport , Iowa and New York and Atkinson @-@ Kier Company of San Francisco and San Diego . The consortium was known as MWAK and their bid was $ 29 @,@ 339 @,@ 301 , almost 15 % lower than the $ 34 @.@ 5 million option submitted by the next bidder , Six Companies , Inc . , which was building Hoover Dam at the time . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Two large cofferdams were constructed for the dam , but they were parallel to the river rather than straddling its width , so drilling into the canyon walls was not required . By the end of 1935 about 1 @,@ 200 workers completed the west and east cofferdams . The west cofferdam was 2 @,@ 000 ft ( 610 m ) long , 50 ft ( 15 m ) thick and was constructed 110 ft ( 34 m ) above the bedrock . The cofferdams allowed workers to dry portions of the riverbed and begin constructing the dam , while water continued to flow down the center of the riverbed . In August 1936 , once the west foundation was complete , portions of the west cofferdam were dismantled , allowing water to flow through part of the dam 's new foundation . In February 1936 , MWAK had begun constructing cofferdams above and below the channel between the east and west cofferdams . By December , the entire Columbia River was diverted over the foundations constructed within the east and west cofferdams . On December 15 , 1936 , the Wenatchee Daily World announced that the river was diverted and by early the next year , people were arriving in large numbers to see the riverbed .

 On August 4 , 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the construction site and was impressed by the project and its purpose . He gave a speech to workers and spectators , closing with this statement : " I leave here today with the feeling that this work is well undertaken ; that we are going ahead with a useful project , and we are going to see it through for the benefit of our country . " Soon after his visit , Reclamation was allowed to proceed with the high dam plan but faced the problems of transitioning the design and negotiating an altered contract with MWAK . In June 1935 , for an additional $ 7 million , MWAK and Six Companies , Inc. agreed to join together as Consolidated Builders Inc. and construct the high dam . Six Companies had just finished the Hoover Dam and was nearing completion of Parker Dam . The new design , chosen and approved by the Reclamation office in Denver , included several improvements , one of which was the irrigation pumping plant . 
 Roosevelt envisioned the dam would fit into his New Deal under the Public Works Administration ; it would create jobs , farming opportunities and would pay for itself . In addition , as part of a larger public effort , Roosevelt wanted to keep electricity prices low by limiting private ownership of utility companies , which could charge high prices for energy . Many opposed a federal takeover of the project , including its most prominent supporters , but Washington State lacked the resources to fully realize the project . In August 1935 , with the help of Roosevelt and a Supreme Court decision allowing the acquisition of public land and Indian Reservations , Congress authorized funding for the upgraded high dam under the 1935 River and Harbors Act . The most significant legislative hurdle for the dam was over . 
 That for the purpose of controlling floods , improving navigation , regulating the flow of the streams of the United States , providing for storage and for the delivery of the stored waters thereof , for the reclamation of public lands and Indian reservations , and other beneficial uses , and for the generation of electric energy as a means of financially aiding and assisting such undertakings the projects known as " Parker Dam " on the Colorado River and " Grand Coulee Dam " on the Columbia River are hereby authorized and adopted .

 = = = First concrete pour and completion = = = 
 On December 6 , 1935 , Governor Clarence Martin presided over the ceremonial first concrete pour . During construction , bulk concrete was delivered on site by rail @-@ cars where it was further processed by eight large mixers before being placed in form . Concrete was poured into 50 sq ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m2 ) columns by crane @-@ lifted buckets , each supporting eight tons of concrete . To cool the concrete and facilitate curing , about 2 @,@ 000 mi ( 3 @,@ 200 km ) of piping was placed throughout the hardening mass . Cold water from the river was pumped into the pipes , reducing the temperature within the forms from 105 ° F ( 41 ° C ) to 45 ° F ( 7 ° C ) . This caused the dam to contract about eight inches in length ; the resulting gaps were filled with grout . 
 Until the project began , the stretch of the Columbia River where the dam was to rise was as yet unbridged , making it difficult to move men and materials . In January 1936 , the Grand Coulee Bridge ( a permanent highway bridge ) was opened after major delays caused by high water ; three additional and temporary bridges downstream had moved vehicles and workers along with sand and gravel for cement mixing . In March 1938 , MWAK completed the lower dam and Consolidated Builders Inc. began constructing the high dam . The west power house was completed in December 1939 and about 5 @,@ 500 workers were on site that year . Between 1940 and 1941 , the dam 's eleven floodgates were installed on the spillway and the dam 's first generator went into operation in January 1941 . The reservoir was full and the first water flowed over the dam 's spillway on June 1 , 1942 , while work was officially complete on January 31 , 1943 . The last of the original 18 generators was not operational until 1950 . 
 = = = Reservoir clearing = = = 
 In 1933 , Reclamation began efforts to purchase land behind the dam as far as 151 mi ( 243 km ) upstream for the future reservoir zone . The reservoir , known later as Lake Roosevelt , flooded 70 @,@ 500 acres ( 285 km2 ) and Reclamation acquired an additional 11 @,@ 500 acres ( 47 km2 ) around the future shoreline . Within the zone were eleven towns , two railroads , three state highways , about one hundred and fifty miles of country roads , four sawmills , fourteen bridges , four telegraph and telephone systems , and many power lines and cemeteries . All facilities had to be purchased or relocated , and 3 @,@ 000 residents were relocated . The Anti @-@ Speculation Act was passed in 1937 , limiting the amount of land farmers could own in order to prevent inflated prices . The government appraised the land and offered to purchase it from the affected residents . Many refused to accept the offers , and Reclamation filed condemnation suits . Members of the Colville Confederated and Spokane tribes who had settlements within the reservoir zone were also resettled . The Acquisition of Indian Lands for Grand Coulee Dam Act of June 29 , 1940 , allowed the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land on the Colville and Spokane Reservations , eventually accounting for 21 @,@ 100 acres ( 85 km2 ) . By 1942 , all land had been purchased at market value : a cost of $ 10 @.@ 5 million that included the relocation of farms , bridges , highways and railroads . Relocation reimbursement was not offered to property owners , which was common until U.S. laws were changed in 1958 . 
 In late 1938 , the Works Progress Administration began clearing the reservoir zone of trees and other plants . A total of 54 @,@ 000 acres ( 220 km2 ) were cleared . The cut timber was floated downstream and sold to the highest bidder , Lincoln Lumber Company , which paid $ 2 @.@ 25 per thousand board feet . The pace of clearing was accelerated in April 1941 when it was declared a national defense project , and the last tree was felled on July 19 , 1941 . The felling was done by Reclamation Supervising Engineer Frank A. Banks and State WPA Administrator Carl W. Smith during a ceremony . A total of 2 @,@ 626 people living in five main camps along the Columbia worked on the project . When it was finished , $ 4 @.@ 9 million had been spent in labor . 
 = = = Labor and supporting infrastructure = = = 
 Workers building the dam received an average of 80 ¢ an hour ; the payroll for the dam was among the largest in the nation . The workers were mainly pulled from Grant , Lincoln , Douglas , and Okanogan counties and women were allowed to work only in the dorms and the cookhouse . Around 8 @,@ 000 people worked on the project , and Frank A. Banks served as the chief construction engineer . Bert A. Hall was the chief inspector who would accept the dam from the contractors . Orin G. Patch served as the chief of concrete . Construction conditions were dangerous and 77 workers died . 
 To prepare for construction , housing for workers was needed along with four bridges downstream of the dam site , one of which , the Grand Coulee Bridge , exists today . The Bureau of Reclamation provided housing and located their administrative building at Engineer 's Town , which was located directly downstream of the construction site on the west side of the river . Opposite Engineer 's Town , MWAK constructed Mason City in 1934 . Mason city contained a hospital , post office , electricity and other amenities along with a population of 3 @,@ 000 . Three @-@ bedroom houses in the city were rented for $ 32 a month . Of the two living areas , Engineer 's City was considered to have the better housing . Several other living areas formed around the construction site in an area known as Shack Town , which did not have reliable access to electricity and the same amenities as the other towns . Incorporated in 1935 , the city of Grand Coulee supported workers as well and is located just west of the dam on the plateau . MWAK eventually sold Mason City to Reclamation in 1937 before its contract was completed . In 1956 , Reclamation combined both Mason City and Engineer 's Town to form the city of Coulee Dam . It was incorporated as a city in February 1959 . 
 = = = Irrigation pumps = = = 
 With the onset of World War II , power generation was given priority over irrigation . In 1943 , Congress authorized the Columbia Basin Project and the Bureau of Reclamation began construction of irrigation facilities in 1948 . Directly to the west and above the Grand Coulee Dam , the North Dam was constructed . This dam , along with the Dry Falls Dam to the south , enclosed and created Banks Lake , which covered the northern 27 mi ( 43 km ) of the Grand Coulee . Additional dams , such as the Pinto and O 'Sullivan Dams , were constructed alongside siphons and canals , creating a vast irrigation supply network called the Columbia Basin Project . Irrigation began between 1951 and 1953 as six of the 12 pumps were installed and Banks Lake was filled .

 = = = Third Powerplant = = = 
 After World War II , the growing demand for electricity sparked interest in constructing another power plant supported by the Grand Coulee Dam . One obstacle to an additional power plant was the great seasonality of the Columbia River 's streamflow . Today the flow is closely managed — there is almost no seasonality . Historically , about 75 % of the river 's annual flow occurred between April and September . During low flow periods , the river 's discharge was between 50 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 1 @,@ 400 m3 / s ) and 80 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 2 @,@ 300 m3 / s ) while maximum spring runoff flows were around 500 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 14 @,@ 000 m3 / s ) . Only nine out of the dam 's eighteen generators could run year @-@ round . The remaining nine operated for less than six months a year . In 1952 , Congress authorized $ 125 @,@ 000 for Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on the Third Powerplant which was completed in 1953 and recommended two locations . Nine identical 108 MW generators were recommended , but as matters stood , they would be able to operate only in periods of high water . 
 Further regulation of the Columbia 's flows was necessary to make the new power plant feasible . Water storage and regulation projects in Canada would be needed , as well as a treaty resolving the many economic and political issues involved . The Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers explored alternatives that would not depend on a treaty with Canada , such as raising the level of Flathead Lake or Pend Oreille Lake , but both proposals faced strong local opposition . The Columbia River Treaty , which had been discussed between the U.S. and Canada since 1944 , was seen as the answer . Efforts to build the Third Powerplant were also influenced by competition with the Soviet Union , which had constructed power plants on the Volga River that were larger than Grand Coulee . On September 16 , 1964 , the Columbia River Treaty was ratified and included an agreement by Canada to construct the Duncan , Keenleyside , Mica Dams upstream and the U.S. would build the Libby Dam in Montana . Shortly afterward , Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson , who was influential in constructing the new power plant , announced that Reclamation would present the project to Congress for appropriation and funding . To keep up with Soviet competition and increase the generating capacity it was determined that the generators could be upgraded to much larger designs . With the possibility of international companies bidding on the project , the Soviets who had just installed a 500 MW hydroelectric generator on the Yenisei River indicated their interest . To avoid the potential embarrassment of an international rival building a domestic power plant , the Department of the Interior declined international bidding . The Third Powerplant was approved and its appropriation bill was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on June 14 , 1966 . 
 Between 1967 and 1974 , the dam was expanded to add the Third Powerplant . Beginning in July 1967 , this involved demolishing the northeast side of the dam and building a new fore @-@ bay section . The excavation of 22 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cu yd ( 16 @,@ 820 @,@ 207 m3 ) of dirt and rock had to be accomplished before the new 1 @,@ 725 ft ( 526 m ) long section of dam was built . The addition made the original 4 @,@ 300 ft ( 1 @,@ 300 m ) dam almost a mile long . Original designs for the powerhouse had twelve smaller units but were altered to incorporate six of the largest generators available . To supply them with water , six 40 ft ( 12 m ) diameter penstocks were installed . Of the new turbines and generators , three 600 MW units were built by Westinghouse and three 700 MW units by General Electric . The first new generator was commissioned in 1975 and the final one in 1980 . The three 700 MW units were later upgraded to 805 MW by Siemens .

 After power shortages in the Northwest during the 1960s , it was determined that the six remaining planned pumps be pump @-@ generators . When energy demand is high , the pump @-@ generators can generate electricity with water from the Banks Lake feeder canal adjacent to the dam at a higher elevation . By 1973 , the Pump @-@ Generating Plant was completed and the first two generators ( P / G @-@ 7 and P / G @-@ 8 ) were operational . In 1983 , two more generators went online , and by January 1984 the final two were operational . The six pump @-@ generators added 314 MW to the dam 's capacity . In May 2009 , the Pump @-@ Generating Plant was officially renamed the John W. Keys III Pump @-@ Generating Power Plant after John W. Keys III , the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 's commissioner from 2001 to 2006 .

 A major overhaul of the Third Powerplant , which contains generators numbered G19 through G24 , began in March 2008 and will be continuing for many years . Among the projects to be completed before the generators themselves can begin to be overhauled include replacing underground 500 kV oil @-@ filled cables for G19 , G20 and G21 generators with overhead transmission lines ( started in February 2009 ) , new 236 MW transformers for G19 and G20 ( started in November 2006 ) , and several other projects .

The generator overhauls for G19 , G20 and G21 have not been scheduled as of 2010 .

 The dam 's primary goal , irrigation , was postponed as the wartime need for electricity increased . The dam 's powerhouse began production around the time World War II began , and its electricity was vital to the war effort . The dam powered aluminum smelters in Longview and Vancouver , Washington , Boeing factories in Seattle and Vancouver , and Portland 's shipyards . In 1943 , its electricity was also used for plutonium production in Richland , Washington , at the Hanford Site , which was part of the top @-@ secret Manhattan Project . The demand for power at that project was so great that in 1943 , two generators originally intended for the Shasta Dam were installed at Grand Coulee in an effort to hurry the generator installation schedule .

 Grand Coulee Dam supports four different power houses containing 33 hydroelectric generators . The original Left and Right Powerhouses contain 18 main generators and the Left has an additional three service generators for total installed capacity of 2 @,@ 280 MW .

Generators G @-@ 19 , G @-@ 20 and G @-@ 21 in the Third Powerplant have a 600 MW installed capacity but can operate at a maximum capacity of 690 MW which brings the overall maximum capacity of the dam 's power facilities to 7 @,@ 079 MW . The Pump @-@ Generating Plant contains six pump @-@ generators with an installed capacity of 314 MW . When pumping water into Banks Lake they consume 600 MW of electricity .

 = = = Cost benefits = = = 
 The Bureau of Reclamation in 1932 estimated the cost of constructing Grand Coulee Dam ( not including the Third Powerplant ) to be $ 168 million ; its actual cost was $ 163 million ( $ 1 @.@ 85 billion in 1998 ) . Expenses to finish the power stations and repair design flaws with the dam throughout the 1940s and ' 50s added another $ 107 million , bringing the total cost to $ 270 million ( $ 2 @.@ 6 billion in 1998 ) , about 33 % over estimates . The Third Powerplant was estimated to cost $ 390 million in 1967 , but higher construction costs and labor disputes drove the project 's final cost in 1973 to $ 730 million ( $ 2 @.@ 93 billion in 1998 ) , about 55 % over estimates . Despite estimates being exceeded , the dam became an economic success , particularly with the Third Powerplant exhibiting a benefit @-@ cost ratio of 2 : 1 . Although Reclamation has only irrigated about half of the land predicted , the gross value of crop output ( in constant dollars ) had doubled from 1962 to 1992 , largely due to different farming practices and crop choices . The Bureau expects the money earned from supplying power and irrigation water will pay off the cost of construction by 2044 .

 The dam had severe negative consequences for the local Native American tribes whose traditional way of life revolved around salmon and the original shrub steppe habitat of the area . Because it lacks a fish ladder , Grand Coulee Dam permanently blocks fish migration , removing over 1 @,@ 100 mi ( 1 @,@ 770 km ) of natural spawning habitat . By largely eliminating anadromous fish above the Okanogan River , the Grand Coulee Dam also set the stage for the subsequent decision not to provide for fish passage at Chief Joseph Dam ( built in 1953 ) . Chinook , Steelhead , Sockeye and Coho salmon ( as well as other important species including <unk> ) are now unable to spawn in the reaches of the Upper Columbia Basin . The extinction of the spawning grounds upstream from the dam has prevented the Spokane and other tribes from holding the first salmon ceremony . 
 Grand Coulee Dam flooded over 21 @,@ 000 acres ( 85 km2 ) of prime bottom land where Native Americans had been living and hunting for thousands of years , forcing the relocation of settlements and graveyards . Kettle Falls , once a primary Native American fishing grounds , was inundated . The average catch of over 600 @,@ 000 salmon per year was eliminated . In one study , the Army Corps of Engineers estimated the annual loss was over 1 million fish . In June 1941 , Native Americans throughout the Northwest met at the Falls for the " Ceremony of Tears " , marking the end of fishing there . One month later , the falls were inundated . The town of Kettle Falls , Washington , was relocated . The Columbia Basin Project has affected habitat ranges for species such as mule deer , pygmy rabbits and burrowing owls , resulting in decreased populations . However , it has created new habitats such as wetlands , and riparian corridors . The environmental impact of the dam effectively ended the traditional way of life of the native inhabitants . The government eventually compensated the Colville Indians in the 1990s with a lump settlement of approximately $ 53 million , plus annual payments of approximately $ 15 million . As of 2011 , the Spokane tribe still seeks compensation , currently through congressional bill H.R. 3097 . 
 To compensate for the lack of ladder , three fisheries have been created above the dam , releasing into the upper Columbia River . One half of the fish are reserved for the displaced tribes , and one quarter of the reservoir is reserved for tribal hunting and boating .

 Built in the late 1970s , the Visitor Center contains many historical photos , geological samples , turbine and dam models , and a theater . The building was designed by Marcel Breuer and resembles a generator rotor . Since May 1989 , on summer evenings , the laser light show at Grand Coulee Dam is projected onto the dam 's wall . The show includes full @-@ size images of battleships and the Statue of Liberty , as well as some environmental comments . Tours of the Third Powerplant are available to the public and last about an hour . Visitors take a shuttle to view the generators and also travel across the main dam span ( otherwise closed to the public ) as the formerly used glass elevator is indefinitely out of service .

 The one hundred euro note ( € 100 ) is one of the higher value euro banknotes and has been used since the introduction of the euro ( in its cash form ) in 2002 . The note is used daily by some 332 million Europeans and in the 23 countries which have it as their sole currency ( with 22 legally adopting it ) . 
 It is the third largest note measuring 147 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 8 in ) × 82 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) and has a green colour scheme . The hundred euro notes depict bridges and arches / doorways in the Baroque and Rococo style ( between the 17th and 18th century ) .

 The euro was founded on 1 January 1999 , when it became the currency of over 300 million people in Europe . For the first three years of its existence it was an invisible currency , only used in accountancy . Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002 , when it replaced the national banknotes and coins of the countries in eurozone 12 , such as the French franc and the Spanish peseta . 
 Slovenia joined the Eurozone in 2007 , Cyprus and Malta in 2008 , Slovakia in 2009 , Estonia in 2011 and Latvia joined on 1 January 2014 .

The earliest date was in Germany , where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001 , though the exchange period lasted for two months more . Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender , they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from ten years to forever .

 = Grey Cup = 
 The Grey Cup is the name of both the championship game of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) and the trophy awarded to the victorious team playing Canadian football . It is contested between the winners of the CFL 's East and West Divisional playoffs and is one of Canadian television 's largest annual sporting events . The Toronto Argonauts have 16 championships , more than any other team . The latest , the 103rd Grey Cup , took place in Winnipeg , Manitoba , on November 29 , 2015 , when the Edmonton Eskimos defeated the Ottawa Redblacks 26 – 20 . 
 The trophy was commissioned in 1909 by the Earl Grey , then Canada 's governor general , who originally hoped to donate it for the country 's senior amateur hockey championship . After the Allan Cup was later donated for that purpose , Grey instead made his trophy available as the " Canadian Dominion Football Championship " ( national championship ) of Canadian football . The trophy has a silver chalice attached to a large base on which the names of all winning teams , players and executives are engraved . The Grey Cup has been broken on several occasions , stolen twice and held for ransom . It survived a 1947 fire that destroyed numerous artifacts housed in the same building . 
 The Grey Cup was first won by the University of Toronto Varsity Blues . Play was suspended from 1916 to 1918 due to the First World War and in 1919 due to a rules dispute . The game has typically been contested in an east versus west format since the 1920s . Traditionally held on a Sunday at the end of November , the Grey Cup has been played in inclement weather at times , including the 1950 " Mud Bowl , " in which a player reportedly came close to drowning in a puddle , then the 1962 " Fog Bowl , " when the final nine minutes of the game had to be postponed to the following day due to a heavy fog , and the 1977 " Ice Bowl , " contested on the frozen @-@ over artificial turf at Montreal 's Olympic Stadium . The Edmonton Eskimos formed the Grey Cup 's longest dynasty , winning five consecutive championships from 1978 to 1982 . Competition for the trophy has been exclusively between Canadian teams , except for a three @-@ year period from 1993 to 1995 , when an expansion of the CFL south into the United States resulted in the Baltimore Stallions winning the 1995 championship and taking the Grey Cup south of the border for the first time .

 = = = Creation and early years ( 1909 – 1921 ) = = = 
 While the Stanley Cup was created in 1893 as the Canadian amateur hockey championship , professional teams were openly competing for the trophy by 1907 . Albert Grey , 4th Earl Grey , the Governor General of Canada , planned to donate a new trophy to serve as the senior amateur championship ; however , Sir Montague Allan donated the Allan Cup before he could finalize his plans . Grey instead offered an award to the Dominion amateur rugby football championship beginning in 1909 . He initially failed to follow through on his offer ; the trophy was not ordered until two weeks prior to the first championship game . 
 The first Grey Cup game was held on December 4 , 1909 , between two Toronto clubs : the University of Toronto Varsity Blues defeated the Parkdale Canoe Club 26 – 6 before 3 @,@ 800 fans . The trophy was not ready for presentation following the game , and the Varsity Blues did not receive it until March 1910 . They retained the trophy in the following two years , defeating the Hamilton Tigers in 1910 and the Toronto Argonauts in 1911 . The University of Toronto failed to reach the 1912 Grey Cup , which was won by the Hamilton Alerts over the Argonauts . The Varsity Blues refused to hand over the trophy on the belief they could keep it until they were defeated in a title game . They kept the trophy until 1914 when they were defeated by the Argonauts , who made the trophy available to subsequent champions . 
 Canada 's participation in the First World War resulted in the cancellation of the championship from 1916 to 1918 , during which time the Cup was forgotten . Montreal Gazette writer Bob Dunn claimed that the trophy was later rediscovered as " one of the family heirlooms " of an employee of the Toronto trust company where it had been sent for storage . The Grey Cup game was also cancelled in 1919 due to a lack of interest from the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union ( IRFU ) and the intercollegiate unions , along with rules conflicts between the Canadian Rugby Union ( CRU ) and the western union . Competition finally resumed in 1920 with the 8th Grey Cup game , won 16 – 3 by the Varsity Blues over the Argonauts . It was the University of Toronto 's fourth , and final , championship . 
 = = = Western competition ( 1922 – 1932 ) = = = 
 Competition for the Grey Cup was limited to member unions of the CRU , the champions of which petitioned the league body for the right to challenge for the national championship . The Western Canada Rugby Football Union joined in 1921 , allowing the Edmonton Eskimos to challenge . Facing the Argonauts in the 9th Grey Cup , the Eskimos became the first western team – and the first from outside Toronto or Hamilton – to compete for the trophy . The Argonauts entered the game with an undefeated record , having outscored their opposition 226 to 55 during the season . They dominated Edmonton , recording the first shutout in Grey Cup history with a 23 – 0 victory . Multi @-@ sport star Lionel Conacher was Toronto 's top player , scoring 15 of his team 's points before leaving the game after the third quarter to join his hockey team for their game . Edmonton challenged for the trophy again in 1922 , but lost 13 – 1 to their eastern opposition , the Queen 's University Golden Gaels . For Queen 's , it was the first of three consecutive titles . 
 Western teams continued to vie for the trophy , but were consistently outclassed for several years . Eastern teams and critics felt the quality of the western game was inferior to theirs , and when Queen 's defeated the Regina Rugby Club 54 – 0 in the 1923 final , the critics felt they deliberately ran up the score to prove that point . Regina was western Canada 's dominant team , appearing in the Grey Cup on six occasions between 1928 and 1934 , but lost to their eastern opponents each time . Regina helped revolutionize Canadian football in 1929 , however , as they attempted the first forward pass in Grey Cup history . The Winnipeg ' <unk> ( now the Blue Bombers ) became the first western Grey Cup champion in 1935 when they defeated the Hamilton Tigers , 18 – 12 . While the Grey Cup was slow to achieve national popularity , the advent of the east versus west format helped make the game the nation 's largest sporting event .

 As the quality of senior football improved , university teams realized they were no longer able to compete on equal footing and withdrew from competition for the Grey Cup in 1933 . By 1938 , only three unions continued to compete under the banner of the CRU : the IRFU and the Ontario Rugby Football Union ( ORFU ) in the east , and the Western Interprovincial Football Union ( WIFU ) in the west . The CRU experimented with a two @-@ game , total points series to determine the champion in 1940 . The Ottawa Rough Riders won both games against Toronto 's <unk> Beach , 8 – 2 and 12 – 5 . The Grey Cup returned to its one @-@ game format the following year . 
 Both the IRFU and WIFU suspended operations in 1942 due to the Second World War . Grey Cup play was expected to be suspended along with the unions ; however , the military felt the game and sport would serve as a morale booster and organized teams at bases across the country . For the following three years , Grey Cup competition was limited to military teams , and in the 1942 Grey Cup , the Toronto RCAF Hurricanes defeated the Winnipeg RCAF Bombers 8 – 5 to become the first non @-@ civilian team to win the national championship . Two years later , the St. Hyacinthe – <unk> Navy defeated the Hamilton Flying Wildcats , 7 – 6 ; no Grey Cup championship since then has featured two eastern teams . The conclusion of the war led to the reformation of civilian teams ; the IRFU resumed play in 1945 , and the WIFU the following year . 
 A push by the sport 's organizers to adopt an increasingly professional attitude dominated the post @-@ war period : poor field conditions , previously accepted as part of the game , resulted in numerous complaints against the CRU following the 1949 and 1950 Grey Cups . Field conditions at Toronto 's Varsity Stadium were so poor in 1950 that the game has since gained infamy as the " Mud Bowl " . Deep ruts in the field and poor weather in the days leading up to the game resulted in a sloppy field covered in large puddles of water . The game also gained notoriety for the near drowning of Winnipeg 's Buddy Tinsley , who was found face down in a large puddle , apparently unconscious . Tinsley later said that he had not lost consciousness , but his leg had gone numb from a hard hit to a preexisting injury . Toronto won the game 13 – 0 , the last time a team has been shut out in a Grey Cup game . 
 The ORFU , the last purely amateur union competing for the Grey Cup , withdrew from Cup competition in 1954 . Although the IRFU and WIFU champions had faced each other in the Grey Cup final since 1945 , the ORFU 's withdrawal left the IRFU and WIFU unchallenged as Canada 's top football unions . The Eskimos faced the Montreal Alouettes in three consecutive Grey Cups in the mid @-@ 1950s , winning all three . Edmonton 's third title in 1956 ended in bizarre fashion : after Jackie Parker scored a touchdown late in the game that gave Edmonton a 50 – 27 lead , fans swarmed the field in celebration . Once officials cleared the field , they discovered that the game ball had disappeared into the crowd . Unable to find another , officials declared the game over . Edmonton was unable to attempt the conversion on their final touchdown . The game also marked the end of the amateur era as the top teams completed their transition to professional organizations . 
 As the 1950s wore on , the IRFU and WIFU distanced themselves from the CRU , forming the Canadian Football Council in 1956 to administer the game at the professional level . Two years later , on January 18 , 1958 , the CFC withdrew from the CRU and reorganized as the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . The new league formally assumed control of the Grey Cup from the CRU .

 In the CFL 's initial seasons , the Hamilton Tiger @-@ Cats were the league 's dominant team , appearing in nine Grey Cups and winning four titles between 1957 and 1967 . The Winnipeg Blue Bombers opposed Hamilton on six of those occasions , winning four titles . The two teams were involved in a series of bizarre incidents , the first occurring during the 1957 Grey Cup . Toronto @-@ based lawyer and fan David Humphrey had talked his way past stadium security and had been allowed to watch the game from the sidelines . Ten minutes into the fourth quarter , Hamilton 's Ray Bawel intercepted a pass and it appeared he would return the ball for a touchdown when Humphrey stuck his leg out and tripped Bawel as he ran up the sideline . Unsure how to handle the situation as there was no rule designed to cover it , referee Paul <unk> invented one on the spot . He placed the ball half the distance to the Winnipeg goal line from the point Bawel was tripped . The incident did not affect the final score , as Hamilton won 32 – 7 . The league also created a new rule during the 1961 Grey Cup as it was the first in history to end regulation time in a tie : CFL Commissioner Sid Halter determined the teams would play an overtime period that consisted of two five @-@ minute halves . That rule remained the CFL standard into the 2000s . Winnipeg scored the lone touchdown in the overtime to defeat Hamilton 21 – 14 . 
 Winnipeg and Hamilton met again in 1962 , the 50th Grey Cup , immortalized as the " Fog Bowl " . The game was held at Toronto 's Exhibition Stadium , and began on Saturday , December 1 , 1962 . The fog rolled in early in the second quarter and became increasingly dense as the game progressed . By the fourth quarter , the players were unable to see the sideline markers and the fans unable to see the play . The players were unable to see the ball in the air – kick returners listened for the sound of the ball hitting the ground – and the action was largely invisible to the television audience . With nine minutes and twenty @-@ nine seconds remaining in the game and Winnipeg holding onto a 28 – 27 lead , officials made the unprecedented decision to suspend play until the next day . Though the league feared that continuing fog on the morning of December 2 would force the complete abandonment of the game , it lifted in time for the contest to resume . Around 15 @,@ 000 of the original 32 @,@ 655 spectators watched Winnipeg win the Grey Cup without further scoring by either team . It was the first title game completed on a Sunday ; the Grey Cup moved from its traditional Saturday start to Sunday in 1969 . 
 = = = Eskimos ' dynasty ( 1970 – 1988 ) = = = 
 The Montreal Alouettes ' 1970 Grey Cup championship , an upset win over the favoured Calgary Stampeders , served as a morale booster for the city of Montreal , which was reeling in the aftermath of the October Crisis . The 1970s belonged to the Edmonton Eskimos , however , as they ended the decade as one of the most dominant teams in CFL history , reaching the Grey Cup nine times between 1973 and 1982 . The team competed in three consecutive finals early in the decade , losing to Ottawa in 1973 and Montreal in 1974 , before winning the franchise 's fourth championship in 1975 . The 1975 championship was held in Calgary and was the first Grey Cup played on the Canadian Prairies . A young woman infamously streaked across the field during the national anthem despite frigid temperatures well below freezing . The only time the Eskimos did not reach the Grey Cup final during this span was in 1976 , when the Saskatchewan Roughriders met the Ottawa Rough Riders . Both teams would fight a see @-@ saw battle , which was decided in the dying seconds of the game when Ottawa quarterback Tom Clements threw to Tony Gabriel , which stood out as the winning touchdown , 23 @-@ 20 . The 1977 Grey Cup was the first held at Olympic Stadium in Montreal , contested by the home town Alouettes and the Eskimos in front of a record crowd of 68 @,@ 318 . The game became known as the " Ice Bowl " , as low temperatures froze snow on the field that had been melted by groundskeepers with salt , making the artificial turf extremely slippery . The Alouettes adapted to the field conditions by affixing staples to the soles of their shoes , improving their traction , and won the game by a 41 – 6 score . 
 Upset at losing the 1977 game under poor weather conditions , the Eskimos hoped for a rematch with Montreal in 1978 . Both teams reached the final game , which Edmonton won 20 – 13 . It was the first of five consecutive championships , a streak that remains unmatched in the history of the Grey Cup . The Eskimos ' dynasty dominated the league , losing a total of only six games during the three seasons from 1979 to 1981 . The 1981 Grey Cup was expected to be yet another easy win for Edmonton , who posted a 14 – 1 – 1 record during the season and were considered overwhelming favourites against the 5 – 11 Ottawa Rough Riders . The first half did not go as Edmonton hoped , though , as Ottawa emerged with a 20 – 1 lead . Quarterback Warren Moon led the Eskimos back in the second half , and with the game tied at 23 , Dave Cutler kicked the game @-@ winning field goal with just three seconds remaining . 
 Edmonton 's championship run came to an end in 1983 when they failed to reach the final ; the Argonauts defeated the BC Lions to win the championship . Despite Toronto 's win , the CFL felt that the overall quality of play in the East Division had deteriorated compared to that of the West . In 1986 , it altered the playoff format to allow the first non @-@ playoff team in one division to take the last playoff spot , but stay in their division if they had a better record . The consequences of the new rules were felt immediately , as the league gave a playoff spot to the Stampeders having a better record than the Alouettes , and decided the East Division Final would be a 2 @-@ game @-@ total @-@ point Final between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger @-@ Cats , who finished first and second , respectively . The crossover , if necessary , would begin in 1987 . In financial difficulty , the loss of the playoff spot was disastrous for Montreal , which ceased operations one year later . Reduced to eight teams , the CFL shifted Winnipeg to the East Division , making the 1988 Grey Cup between the Blue Bombers and Lions the first championship game between two western Canadian teams .

 The 1989 Grey Cup is considered one of the finest games in Canadian football history : The Saskatchewan Roughriders defeated the Hamilton Tiger @-@ Cats 43 – 40 in the highest scoring Grey Cup game of all @-@ time . Saskatchewan kicker Dave Ridgway 's last @-@ second field goal won the game and made him a legend in the prairie province . 
 Declining interest in the CFL during the 1990s left the league in financial difficulty . Hoping to restore the league 's credibility with fans , a new ownership group featuring Bruce McNall , hockey player Wayne Gretzky and actor John Candy purchased the Toronto Argonauts in 1991 and lured American college standout Rocket Ismail to Canada with a four @-@ year , $ 26 @.@ 2 million contract which made him the highest paid player in football history at that time . The Argonauts reached the 1991 Grey Cup and defeated the Calgary Stampeders 36 – 21 . With 261 all @-@ purpose yards on the game , including a then @-@ Grey Cup record 87 @-@ yard kickoff return for a touchdown , Ismael was named Grey Cup Most Valuable Player . 
 The potential for the league to enter the American market was discussed in 1987 when operators of the defunct United States Football League approached the CFL about merging the two leagues . The league showed little interest at the time , but as it continued its decline , the CFL reevaluated its position . In 1992 , the CFL announced that it would expand into the United States . The Sacramento Gold Miners joined the league and became the first American team eligible to win the Grey Cup . The league added three additional American teams in 1994 and two in 1995 ( with one team folding ) , but the initiative failed in most markets , and by 1996 , the CFL again operated exclusively within Canada . 
 The lone successful American market was in Baltimore , home to the Stallions . The team averaged over 35 @,@ 000 fans per game in its inaugural season , nearly double that of Toronto or Hamilton . They matched that success on the field by becoming the first American team to play in the Grey Cup . The BC Lions kept the Grey Cup in Canada with a 26 – 23 victory in the 1994 final . Baltimore returned to the title game one year later and became the only American team to win the trophy by defeating the Calgary Stampeders , 37 – 20 . The relocation of the National Football League 's Cleveland Browns to Baltimore in 1996 caused the Stallions to seek a new city to avoid direct competition with an NFL team . The team moved to Montreal , forming the current incarnation of the Alouettes franchise and ending the CFL 's excursion into the United States . 
 = = = Renaissance ( 1996 – present ) = = = 
 The league approached the 1996 Grey Cup in dire financial straits : the American expansion had been a failure , the 120 @-@ year @-@ old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise ceased operations at the conclusion of the regular season , and out of the eight remaining teams , seven had lost money and two required direct assistance from the league to stay afloat . The Edmonton Eskimos could not afford to bring their players ' families to the championship game . The Toronto Star echoed fears spoken by fans and media across the country when it asked if the 1996 championship , won by Toronto over Edmonton , would be the final Grey Cup . 
 While the league struggled , the Grey Cup game itself retained its popularity and remained a national institution . The strength of the contest allowed the league to endure its challenges . The CFL survived into 1997 and was buoyed by a new television deal with The Sports Network which , along with the launch of its popular Friday Night Football program , has been credited with saving the league . That year 's Grey Cup , held in Edmonton and won by Toronto , drew nearly 22 @,@ 000 more fans than the previous year . The CFL restored its reputation over time , enjoying new popularity into the 2000s such that it no longer had to rely on an exciting Grey Cup final to achieve stability for the next season . 
 In 2000 , the 8 – 10 BC Lions made history when they defeated the Montreal Alouettes , 28 – 26 , becoming the first team in history to win the Grey Cup with a losing record in the regular season . In the game , 25 @-@ year veteran Lui Passaglia ended the longest career in CFL history by kicking what was ultimately the game @-@ winning field goal . The Calgary Stampeders matched the Lions ' feat the next year by becoming the second 8 – 10 team to win the Grey Cup , defeating the Winnipeg Blue Bombers by a 27 – 19 score in front of 65 @,@ 255 fans , the second largest crowd in the game 's history . 
 The 2005 Grey Cup was the second overtime game in Grey Cup history , and the first one using the league 's shootout overtime format ( introduced in 2000 ) . Both the Eskimos and Alouettes scored touchdowns on their first possessions , while Edmonton scored a field goal in its second and held Montreal scoreless to win the game by a 38 – 35 score . The game was played in the middle of a stretch of eight Grey Cup appearances by the Alouettes between 2000 and 2010 . In 2009 , they defeated the Roughriders in dramatic fashion : placekicker Damon Duval missed a last @-@ second field goal attempt that appeared to give Saskatchewan the victory . However , the Riders were penalized for having too many men on the field , allowing Duval a second opportunity . His second attempt was successful , giving Montreal a 28 – 27 victory . 
 The 100th Grey Cup game was played on November 25 , 2012 at the Rogers Centre in Toronto between the Toronto Argonauts and the Calgary Stampeders . The Toronto Argonauts won the Grey Cup with a score of 35 @-@ 22 . 
 As per a new title sponsorship deal with Shaw Communications announced in May 2015 , the event will henceforth be known as the Grey Cup presented by Shaw . 
 The 104th Grey Cup game will be played at BMO Field in Toronto , which will become the new home of the Argonauts beginning in the 2016 season .

 The trophy was commissioned in 1909 at a cost of $ 48 . The chalice is made of sterling silver and stands 33 centimetres ( 13 in ) tall . Its original base was made of wood , with silver shields listing each championship year and winning team 's name , beginning with the University of Toronto Varsity Blues . The players of the 1915 championship Hamilton team , apparently as revenge for Toronto 's refusal to relinquish the trophy in 1912 and 1913 , added a shield for the 1908 Tigers team to give the appearance that their organization had won the first Grey Cup . 
 A 1947 fire destroyed the clubhouse of the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and damaged the Grey Cup . Many other trophies and artifacts in the clubhouse melted or were damaged beyond repair but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed . The trophy has been broken on six other occasions : in 1978 , when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players ; in 1987 , when an Eskimos ' player sat on it ; in 1993 , when Edmonton 's Blake Dermott head @-@ butted it ; in 2006 , when the trophy broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory ; in 2012 when one of the handles broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated ; and finally in 2014 when trophy broke from its base again by the Calgary Stampeders after their win . The CFL commissioned a replica of the trophy in 2008 . 
 The Grey Cup has been stolen on two occasions : it disappeared for three days in 1967 when it was taken from the Hamilton Tiger @-@ Cats as a prank , and in December 1969 it was stolen from the offices of the Ottawa Rough Riders at Lansdowne Park . The thieves attempted to ransom the trophy , but the CFL refused to pay and made plans to replace it with a duplicate . An anonymous phone call led to the trophy 's recovery two months later in a locker at Toronto 's Royal York Hotel . The thieves were never found . 
 The current design of the Grey Cup 's base was introduced in 1987 . The base stands 84 centimetres ( 33 in ) high and is made of black @-@ lacquered aluminum with silver plates engraved with the names of each winning team 's players and executives since 1909 . The trophy , one of Canada 's best known symbols , will run out of room for new additions following the 2012 Grey Cup . The league has announced that the base will be redesigned but will remain similar in shape to its current design . 
 Members of the winning teams are allowed time to celebrate with the trophy in their own fashion , often taking it to their home towns or tours in locations across Canada . The board of directors for the Canadian Football Hall of Fame act as the Grey Cup 's trustees and control its rental for events . The trophy is accompanied by a designated representative of the Hall of Fame at all times . 
 = = Grey Cup festival = = 
 Each year , the host city organizes numerous events as part of the annual Grey Cup festival . Gala concerts , parties , and fan festivals are held in the days leading up to the championship game . The CFL hands out its annual awards during the festival , and an annual Grey Cup parade is held . Historically , the festival also featured the " Miss Grey Cup " beauty pageant . The game itself includes a halftime show , often featuring performances by well @-@ known Canadian musical acts such as Nickelback , who performed at the 2011 game . 
 Nicknamed Canada 's " Grand National Drunk " , the Grey Cup party originated in the 1948 championship when hundreds of Calgary Stampeders fans descended on Toronto for their team 's first appearance in the game . Bringing chuckwagons and horses , the fans organized a pancake breakfast – a staple of the Calgary Stampede – for bewildered Torontonians . According to historian Hugh Dempsey , " The Grey Cup was just another game until Calgary went down to Toronto with chuckwagons and everything and turned it into an event . " The Stampeders won the game on the strength of the " sleeper play " , a touchdown scored by Norm Hill after he hid himself from the Ottawa defence by lying down on the sidelines , as if asleep . He received the pass from quarterback Keith <unk> while still on his back . The victory completed the only undefeated season in the history of Canadian professional football . The boisterous celebrations that followed the win gave rise to the legend of Calgary alderman and future mayor Don Mackay riding his horse into the lobby of the Royal York Hotel . This event was repeated in the 2012 Grey Cup game in Toronto to much of the delight of the fans of both teams . The Calgary Grey Cup Committee maintains the tradition of organizing a pancake breakfast at each year 's championship . 
 A 2012 survey found that Canadians consider the Grey Cup to be the most important annual event to attend . Fans of all teams converge at the game venue , including some who have attended 60 or more Grey Cups . The influx of people from across the country is estimated to have an economic impact of over $ 120 million for the region hosting the championship game .

 The city of Toronto has hosted the most Grey Cup games with 47 , including 30 of the first 45 games played . The first game was held on December 4 , 1909 , at Rosedale Field . Hamilton and Ottawa hosted several early games while Sarnia and Kingston each hosted one as the game 's early years were dominated by teams in southern Ontario . The Grey Cup game and champion first left the province in 1931 , when Montreal hosted the event and the Montreal AAA Winged Wheelers won the 19th Grey Cup .

 = = Broadcasting = = 
 The Grey Cup game was first broadcast on radio in 1928 . The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) carried radio coverage of the game for 51 years until 1986 , when a network of private broadcasters took over . 
 Canadian television was in its infancy in 1952 when Toronto 's <unk> paid $ 7 @,@ 500 for the rights to carry the first televised broadcast of a Grey Cup game . Within two years , it was estimated that 80 percent of the nation 's 900 @,@ 000 television sets were tuned into the game , even though the first national telecast did not occur until 1957 . The Grey Cup continues to be one of Canada 's most @-@ viewed sporting events . The 1962 " Fog Bowl " game was the first Grey Cup to be broadcast on American television . 
 The CBC carried the first national telecasts exclusively , but the CTV Television Network purchased rights to the 1962 game . The move sparked concern across Canada as the newly formed network was not yet available in many parts of the country . The debate over whether an " event of national interest " should be broadcast by the publicly funded CBC or private broadcasters reached the floor of Parliament as members of the federal government weighed in . It was decided that both networks would carry the game . The two networks continued with the simulcast arrangement until 1986 when CTV ceased its coverage . 
 The CFL operated the Canadian Football Network , a coalition of private broadcasters that shared league games and the Grey Cup with the CBC , from 1987 to 1990 . CBC then broadcast the championship game alone until 2007 , when the CFL sold exclusive rights to all games , including the Grey Cup , to specialty channel The Sports Network ( TSN ) and its French @-@ language sister station Réseau des sports ( RDS ) , a deal that was criticized by Canadians without cable access . Nonetheless , TSN and RDS achieved a record audience for the 2009 Grey Cup , with 6 @.@ 1 million Canadians watching the game in its entirety , and over 14 million viewing at least part of the contest . Viewership has declined in recent years , and in 2014 , about 33 % , of Canadians watched at least some of the game , peaking at 5 @.@ 1 million viewers in the fourth quarter . 
 = 29th Battalion ( Australia ) = 
 The 29th Battalion was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army . First formed in 1915 for service during the First World War as part of the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) , it fought in the trenches of the Western Front in France and Belgium before being disbanded in late 1918 to provide reinforcements for other heavily depleted Australian units . In 1921 , following the demobilisation of the AIF , the battalion was re @-@ raised as a unit of Australia 's part @-@ time military forces , based in Melbourne , Victoria , before being amalgamated with the 22nd Battalion in 1930 . It was later re @-@ raised in its own right and , following the outbreak of the Second World War , undertook garrison duties in Australia before being amalgamated with the 46th Battalion to form the 29th / 46th Battalion in late 1942 , subsequently seeing service against the Japanese in New Guinea and on New Britain .

 = = = First World War = = = 
 The 29th Battalion was originally formed during the First World War , being raised in Victoria as part of the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) on 10 August 1915 . Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Bennett , an officer with over 20 years service in the part @-@ time military forces , the battalion undertook initial training at Seymour and then later Broadmeadows Camp along with the three other battalions of the 8th Brigade , to which it was assigned . In November 1915 , the battalion embarked upon the troopship HMAT Ascanius in Port Melbourne and departed Australian waters , disembarking at Port Suez , Egypt on 7 December 1915 . The battalion arrived in the Middle East too late to take part in the fighting at Gallipoli , and as a result they were initially used to undertake defensive duties to protect the Suez Canal from Ottoman forces . They also undertook a comprehensive training program and by the time their orders arrived to transfer to Europe in June 1916 , they had reached their peak . They subsequently embarked the troopship HMT Tunisian in Alexandria , bound for France on 14 June . Upon the battalion 's arrival in Egypt , the 8th Brigade had been unattached at divisional level , but in early 1916 , it was assigned to the 5th Division , after a reorganisation that saw the AIF expanded from two infantry divisions to five . 
 The battalion arrived at Marseilles on 23 June and afterwards was transported by rail to Hazebrouck . On 8 July the 5th Division was called up to the front from training behind lines in order to replace the battalions of the Australian 4th Division which were being transferred to the Somme . The 29th Battalion undertook a difficult two @-@ day 29 @-@ mile ( 47 km ) approach march over cobbled roads with loads of up to 70 – 75 pounds ( 32 – 34 kg ) before arriving at the front on the night of 10 / 11 July . Taking up a position between <unk> and <unk> in the Bois Grenier , they relieved the 13th Battalion and on 19 July subsequently took part in an attack against the German positions around the " <unk> Farm " which was being held by the 21st Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment . Following the attack , the battalion held the line for another 11 days , beating off a particularly heavy German counterattack on 20 July , before they were eventually relieved . During their introduction to trench warfare , the 29th Battalion lost 52 men killed in action , and another 164 men wounded . 
 For the next two and half years they fought in a number of major battles in the trenches along the Western Front including Polygon Wood , Amiens and the St Quentin Canal , as well as playing a supporting role in a number of others including Bullecourt and Morlancourt . During the Allied Hundred Days Offensive that was launched on 8 August 1918 , the battalion took part in the 8th Brigade 's advance up the treacherous <unk> Valley , subsequently achieving a considerable feat by capturing the town of <unk> . The battalion fought its last battle of the war in late September alongside the US 30th Infantry Division , when they breached the German defences along the Hindenburg Line as part of the final Allied offensive of the war . Aimed at the Le <unk> Line near Bellicourt , the battalion began its advance on Nauroy on 29 September , moving on the left flank beside elements of the US 117th Infantry Regiment , with the 32nd Battalion in support . The attack proved highly successful and 59 prisoners were captured along with four field guns and a quantity of German small arms . Against this the battalion lost 17 men killed and 63 wounded . 
 Following this , they were withdrawn from the front line . By this time casualties amongst the Australian Corps had reached critical level and as a result many battalions — from an authorised strength of over 1 @,@ 000 men — were only able to field between 300 and 400 . As a result , the decision was made to reduce the number of infantry battalions in each brigade from four to three by disbanding one battalion and using its personnel to reinforce the others . The 29th Battalion was one of those chosen to be broken up and as a result on 19 October 1918 , the 29th Battalion was disbanded . The majority of the battalion 's personnel — 29 officers and 517 other ranks — were transferred to the 32nd Battalion as reinforcements . 
 During its service on the Western Front , the battalion suffered 485 men killed and another 1 @,@ 399 men wounded . Members of the battalion received the following decorations : three Distinguished Service Orders and one bar , one Member of the Order of the British Empire , 20 Military Crosses , 17 Distinguished Conduct Medals , 94 Military Medals with three bars , three Meritorious Service Medals , 17 Mentioned in Despatches and five awards from other Allied nations . The 29th Battalion was bestowed 19 battle honours in 1927 for its involvement in the war .

 The battalion was re @-@ raised in 1921 as part the re @-@ organisation of the Australian military that took place at that time , with the battalion becoming a part @-@ time unit of the Citizen Forces , assigned to the 4th Brigade , 3rd Division . Upon formation , the battalion drew its personnel from four previously existing Citizen Forces units : the 2nd Battalion , 29th Infantry Regiment ; the 5th Battalion , 6th Infantry Regiment ; 5th Battalion , 15th Infantry Regiment and part of the 29th Light Horse , and perpetuated the battle honours and traditions of its associated AIF battalion . Based in Melbourne , the battalion was brought up to its authorised strength of around 1 @,@ 000 men through the compulsory training scheme . The following year , however , the Army 's budget was cut in half and the scope of the scheme reduced following the resolution of the Washington Naval Treaty which arguably improved Australia 's strategic outlook . As a result of this , the battalion 's authorised strength was reduced to just 409 men of all ranks and training and recruitment were scaled back significantly . 
 In 1927 , territorial titles were introduced into the Australian Army and the battalion adopted the title of the " East Melbourne Regiment " . At this time , the battalion was afforded the motto Nulli Secundus . In 1929 , following the election of the Scullin Labor government , the compulsory training scheme was suspended altogether as it was decided to maintain the part @-@ time military force on a volunteer @-@ only basis . In order to reflect the change , the Citizen Forces was renamed the " Militia " at this time . The end of compulsory training and the fiscal austerity that followed with the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower available to many Militia units at this time dropped well below their authorised establishments and as a result the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units . Subsequently the 29th Battalion was amalgamated with the 22nd in 1930 , forming the 29th / 22nd Battalion , although they were later split again in August 1939 and the 29th re @-@ raised in its own right . 
 = = = Second World War and beyond = = = 
 Following the outbreak of the Second World War , the Australian government decided to raise an all @-@ volunteer force for service overseas due to the provisions of the Defence Act ( 1903 ) , which precluded compelling the Militia to serve outside of Australian territory . This force was known as the Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) . Although the 2nd AIF would be raised upon a cadre of trained officers and non @-@ commissioned officers drawn from the Militia , the Militia 's main role at this time was to provide training to the men called up as part of the compulsory training scheme that was readopted in early 1940 . Throughout 1940 – 41 the battalion undertook a number of short periods of continuous training , however , following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and invasion of Malaya in December 1941 , it was mobilised for war service . 
 In March 1942 , the 4th Brigade was sent to Queensland to undertake garrison duties and man defences along the coast to defend against a possible Japanese invasion . By mid @-@ 1942 , however , due to manpower shortages that occurred in the Australian economy as a result of over mobilisation of its military forces , the Australian government decided to disband a number of Militia units in order to release their personnel back into the civilian workforce . As a result of this decision , in August 1942 , the 29th Battalion was amalgamated with the 46th Battalion to form the 29th / 46th Battalion . This unit went on to serve overseas in New Guinea and on New Britain . After the war , following the demobilisation of the wartime Army , Australia 's part @-@ time military was re @-@ formed in 1948 , but the 29th Battalion was not re @-@ raised at the time . In 1961 , although the battalion was in a state of suspended animation , it was entrusted with the four battle honours awarded to the 2 / 29th Battalion for its service in Malaya during World War II and the three earned by the 29th / 46th Battalion .

 Pennsylvania Route 237 was an 3 @.@ 88 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 24 km ) route between State Route 37 and State Route 590 in Lackawaxen to an intersection with State Route 137 ( now State Route 434 ) in Shohola Township . The route followed the shores of the Delaware River as Lackawaxen Road . The route 's alignment , after assignment in 1928 , remained the same until being removed from the state highway system in 1946 . The route was paved in 1932 , and the route is now known as State Route 1012 and Shohola Township Roads 413 and 454 .

 The alignment of State Route 237 began at an intersection with its parent highway , State Route 37 in Lackawaxen Township , near Roebling 's Delaware Aqueduct . This is currently the intersection with State Route 590 . The highway heads eastward along the banks of the Delaware River and a nearby railroad track towards Shohola Township . There is an intersection with Delaware Drive just after the inception . Delaware Drive heads to a dead @-@ end at the banks of the Delaware River . The highway passes some homes to the north and a dense forest to the south . There is also a mansion atop a nearby hill . After a clearing , the highway enters the dense forest completely and turns to the southeast . 
 With the train tracks , Delaware River and New York State Route 97 paralleling to the north , the highway begins a southeastern track . There are some occasional clearings , The old alignment of State Route 237 passes a pond as the highway pulls away from the river and train tracks with the forests becoming a majority the surroundings . The old alignment of State Route 237 passes a pond , as the highway pulls away from the river and train tracks . The highway intersects with Township Road 413 , which serves access to Hirsh Pond , located to the north . The route begins to head through larger clearings as it continues southeast . At an intersection with German Hill Road , the highway makes a shot to the east , passing through some woods . After the woods , the old alignment of State Route 237 ends at an intersection with State Route 434 . This was once an intersection with State Route 137 .

 State Route 237 was assigned in 1928 , during the mass numbering of state highways within Pennsylvania . The termini at the time were with State Route 37 and State Route 137 , the former of which was the parent route . At the time , the entire highway was an unimproved gravel road . This lasted for four years , until 1932 , when the Pennsylvania Department of Highways paved the highway . The highway remained relatively unchanged until 1946 , when the highway was decommissioned in a mass deletion of state highways within the commonwealth . The current alignment of former State Route 237 is now Pike County Quadrant Route 1012 from PA 590 to the Shohola Township border . The rest is locally maintained , with a piece at PA 434 designated Shohola Township Roads 413 and 454 . The two state routes at the termini , State Routes 37 and 137 , are now State Routes 434 and 590 .

 = Przevalski 's nuthatch = 
 Przevalski 's nuthatch ( Sitta przewalskii ) , originally given the nomen nudum Sitta <unk> , is a bird species in the family Sittidae . Long regarded as a subspecies of the white @-@ cheeked nuthatch ( Sitta leucopsis ) , it nevertheless differs significantly in morphology and vocalizations . Both S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been regarded as closely related to the North American white @-@ breasted nuthatch ( Sitta carolinensis ) . It is a medium @-@ sized nuthatch , measuring about 13 cm ( 5 in ) in length . Its upper body is a dark gray @-@ blue or slate color , becoming dark blue @-@ black at the crown . The cheeks and throat are a white buff @-@ orange , turning to a rich cinnamon on the underparts that intensifies in color on the sides of the breast . Vocalizations consist of alternating series of ascending whistles and short notes . 
 The bird is endemic to areas in southeastern Tibet and west central China , including eastern Qinghai , Gansu and Sichuan , inhabiting coniferous mountain forests of spruce or fir . The altitude at which it nests varies according to locality , but typically is from 2 @,@ 250 – 4 @,@ 500 m ( 7 @,@ 380 – 14 @,@ 760 ft ) . The species was first described in 1891 from a specimen collected in China 's Haidong Prefecture . The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky , who discovered the species in 1884 . Little is known about its ecology , which is probably comparable to that of the white @-@ cheeked nuthatch . 
 It was given the rank of full species ( separate from the white @-@ cheeked nuthatch ) in 2005 in Pamela C. Rasmussen 's Birds of South Asia . The Ripley Guide . Other authorities followed suit , but as of 2014 , S. przewalskii does not have a full threat @-@ status evaluation by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature . A 2014 phylogenetic study of the species found it to be at the base of the nuthatch evolutionary tree out of 21 species examined , dispelling a hypothesis that S. przewalskii could belong to the same species as S. carolinensis . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The nuthatches constitute a genus – Sitta – of small passerine birds belonging to the family Sittidae . The genus may be further divided into seven subgenera , of which S. przewalskii belongs to <unk> , along with its nominate subspecies , Sitta leucopsis , and the white @-@ breasted nuthatch ( Sitta carolinensis ) . Nuthatches are typified by short , compressed wings and short , square 12 @-@ feathered tails , compact bodies , longish pointed bills , strong toes with long claws , and behaviorally , by their unique head @-@ first manner of descending tree trunks . Most nuthatches have gray or blue upperparts and a black eyestripe . ( One recognizable feature of Przevalski 's nuthatch is that it lacks the eyestripe common to most nuthatch species . ) 
 Sitta is derived from the Ancient Greek name for nuthatches , σιττη , sittē . " Nuthatch " , first recorded in 1350 , is derived from " nut " and a word probably related to " hack " , since these birds hack at nuts they have wedged into crevices . 
 Sitta przewalskii was first scientifically described in 1891 by Russians Mikhail Mikhailovich Berezovsky and Valentin Bianchi based on a single specimen obtained in the Haidong Prefecture , in Eastern Qinghai . The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky , who discovered the species in Tibet in 1884 and dubbed it Sitta <unk> without providing adequate description , rendering it a nomen nudum . Though the primary habitats of Sitta przewalskii and the white @-@ cheeked nuthatch ( Sitta leucopsis ) are separated from each other by almost 1 @,@ 500 km ( 930 mi ) , Przevalski 's nuthatch was described as closely related to the white @-@ cheeked nuthatch , and was thereafter often considered and treated <unk> , as a subspecies of S. leucopsis . 
 In 2005 , Pamela C. Rasmussen granted the taxon autonomous status in her book , Birds of South Asia . The Ripley Guide , uncoupling the species from S. leucopsis . The classification was noted by ornithologists Nigel J. Collar and John D. Pilgrim in 2007 , and endorsed by the International Ornithological Congress , by Alan P. Peterson in his well @-@ known Zoological Nomenclature Resource ( <unk> ) , and by the Internet Bird Collection ( IBC ) , sponsored by the Handbook of the Birds of the World . No subspecies of S. przewalskii itself have been identified . 
 In explaining this separation of species , Rasmussen points to morphological divergence and significant differences in vocalization . Ornithologist Edward C. Dickinson observed in a 2006 article that though evidence of morphological and vocal differences between S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been delineated , little had yet been published presenting comparative morphological details , and that it would be instructive to study how each taxon responds to the calls of the other . 
 The white @-@ cheeked nuthatch , with S. przewalskii subsumed within it , has been regarded as closely related to the North American white @-@ breasted nuthatch ( Sitta carolinensis ) , which has a similar contact call ( though S. <unk> 's is moderately higher in pitch ) , and they have sometimes been treated as conspecific . In turn , it has been proposed that the triumvirate of S. przewalskii , S. leucopsis and S. carolinensis could be related to the Sitta canadensis , monophyletic group , corresponding to the subgenus <unk> , which includes six species of average @-@ sized nuthatches . The relationships remain very unclear . A molecular study by Eric Pasquet conducted in 2014 may provide some clarity . 
 In 2014 , Eric Pasquet , et al. published a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 nuthatch species . Though S. leucopsis was not included in the study , it found that within the nuthatch group covered , S. przewalskii is basal — an ancestor at the base ( or root ) — to the nuthatch evolutionary family tree , and thus " sister to all other nuthatches , without any close relatives " . The findings resulted from phylogenetic analyses ( employing Bayesian inference and the maximum likelihood methods ) . A biogeographical analysis ( using the dispersal @-@ extinction – <unk> model ) was then performed . The cladogram drawn from the evidence indicates that the first clade and closest descendants of Przevalski 's nuthatch are the North American white @-@ breasted nuthatch and the giant nuthatch ( S. magna ) , dispelling the hypothesis that S. przewalskii could belong to the same species as S. carolinensis . 
 = = Description = = 
 Because Sitta przewalskii has long been regarded as a subspecies of the white @-@ cheeked nuthatch , its description has often been made in comparison with it . Though both species lack the black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches , their coloring is distinct , with S. leucopsis being white- or creamy @-@ buff on its throat , cheeks , breast , flanks and belly , where S. przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of cinnamon . S. przewalskii is also the smaller of the two , and its bill is markedly thinner . Males and females of the species are nearly identical in appearance , except for the male 's brighter cinnamon coloring . 
 The area above the eyes , including the forehead , crown and nape , is a deep blue @-@ black , through the top edge of the mantle . The mantle proper is a medium to dark gray @-@ blue as are the tertials and upperwing @-@ coverts , turning to a dark gray at the median , greater and primary coverts and the alula . The secondaries and inner primaries are fringed in gray @-@ blue . The central rectrices are gray @-@ blue , and the outer rectrices are a blackish @-@ gray , paling towards the tips . 
 The face and surrounding areas , including the lores , supercilium , ear @-@ coverts , cheeks and throat are a white buff @-@ orange . Below , the belly and breast are a rich cinnamon , darkening to an orange @-@ cinnamon at the sides of the breast . The rear flanks and undertail @-@ covert feathers are rufous . In worn plumage , the color may be uneven in the lower parts and lighter in hue . The upper mandible of the bill is black , and the lower is gray with a black tip . The iris and legs are dark brown . Juveniles of the species resemble adults but for the base of their beaks being yellow , proportionately shorter , and their overall coloring being less vibrant . 
 Przevalski 's nuthatch is a medium @-@ sized bird , measuring about 12 @.@ 5 – 13 cm ( 4 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 1 in ) in length . The folded wing of the male is 72 – 77 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 0 in ) long and that of the female 69 – 74 mm ( 2 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 9 in ) ; an average of 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) shorter than the white @-@ cheeked nuthatch . The wingspan is about 22 @.@ 5 cm ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) . The beak measures 17 – 17 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 67 – 0 @.@ 69 in ) , which is thinner and shorter than that of S. leucopsis , in which the beak is approximately 21 mm ( 0 @.@ 83 in ) long . The tarsus is 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) , and the tail is 43 mm ( 1 @.@ 7 in ) in length . 
 = = Vocalizations and behavior = = 
 Sitta przewalskii 's territorial calls differ significantly from those of S. leucopsis , whose notes are more nasal , whereas the song of S. przewalskii is in long verses composed of whistles that ascend in pitch , interspersed with short notes . According to the Handbook of the Birds of the World , vocalizations include a " muffled , mellow ' chip ' repeated in irregular series ... ; a loud , emphatic , whistled ' <unk> ' or ' <unk> @-@ <unk> ' ; a slightly nasal , querulous ' que ' , usually repeated 3 – 5 times ... ; and thinner ' pee @-@ pee @-@ pee @-@ pee ...

 In 1950 , English naturalist Frank Ludlow reported a description of the bird , as provided to him by Ernst Schäfer who studied an adult male near <unk> in 1934 . It was characterized as : " one of the shyest and rarest denizens of the conifer forest " , and one leading a solitary life , much like nearby populations of three @-@ toed woodpeckers ( <unk> <unk> funebris ) . By contrast , Ludlow observed the species in southeastern Tibet , probably during the winter , and did not find it particularly reserved . He reports having killed a specimen in a willow tree , far from the species ' usual coniferous nesting grounds . The specimen was captured on the outskirts of a forest , on a ridge between two valleys , where it stood on a dead branch from which it launched in pursuit of insects in flight , like a flycatcher . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The species is endemic to an area in west central China and southeastern Tibet . In China , it is found in eastern Qinghai , from the Daba Mountains as far north as the <unk> Hui Autonomous County , and as far south as the plateau of Amdo ( 35 ° N. 101 ° E. ) , as well as in the southern part of Qinghai in <unk> County ; in the area of the Yellow River in <unk> County ; in Gansu , southwest of <unk> and Min counties ; in Sichuan , where it has been observed in the north , center and west of the province , including sightings in <unk> County at the <unk> Valley nature reserve , in the <unk> Mountains in the Wolong District , in the region of <unk> County , and in the area of <unk> . The species has also been observed in Kunming , Yunnan , in far southwestern China , where it most likely migrates to overwinter . 
 In Tibet , the species has been found in the northeastern Tibet Autonomous Region in the <unk> Prefecture ; and in the southeast of the region in Tse ( in December ) and in Dzeng ( in April ) , both in the South Tibet ( Tsangpo ) Valley region . The Tsangpo Valley sightings may be anomalous , only indicating winter visitation . The bird observed in Dzeng was in an environment alien to the species ' normal coniferous forest environs , and both the Dzeng and Tse individuals had atypically pale underparts , indicating they may have been nominate S. leucopsis , but with genetic introgression traits from Przevalski 's nuthatch . 
 S. przewalskii inhabits coniferous mountain forests of spruce or fir . Its altitudinal range commonly approaches a forest 's tree line . In China it has been observed at height distributions of 4 @,@ 270 m ( 14 @,@ 010 ft ) ( in Sichuan during August ) and in Qinghai at 2 @,@ 590 – 2 @,@ 895 m ( 8 @,@ 497 – 9 @,@ 498 ft ) and at approximately 2 @,@ 250 m ( 7 @,@ 380 ft ) ( during June ) . In western Nepal a range of 2 @,@ 745 – 4 @,@ 575 m ( 9 @,@ 006 – 15 @,@ 010 ft ) has been described . In Tibet individuals have been recorded at heights of 3 @,@ 500 – 4 @,@ 500 m ( 11 @,@ 500 – 14 @,@ 800 ft ) in the northeast , and from 2 @,@ 895 – 3 @,@ 050 m ( 9 @,@ 498 – 10 @,@ 007 ft ) in the southeast . 
 = = Threats and protection = = 
 Sitta przewalskii is not yet treated as an independent species by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , and its threat level is not evaluated by either . Despite being described as rare in China and Southeast Tibet , because the taxon is treated instead as a subspecies of S. leucopsis , the evaluation of its population incorporates the relative abundance of its parent species . Concomitantly , it takes on its parent category of least concern . As S. przewalskii has not been extensively studied independently from S. leucopsis , a classification of data deficient could be applied , but the rarity of sightings indicates concern for its status ; a finding of near threatened or even classification as a vulnerable species may be warranted . 
 = Invader ( artist ) = 
 Invader is the pseudonym of a well @-@ known French urban artist , born in 1969 , whose work is modelled on the crude <unk> of 1970s – 1980s 8 @-@ bit video games . He took his name from the 1978 arcade game Space Invaders , and much of his work is composed of square ceramic tiles inspired by video game characters . Although he prefers to remain incognito , and guards his identity carefully , his distinctive creations can be seen in many highly @-@ visible locations in more than 65 cities in 33 countries . He documents each intervention in a city as an " Invasion " , and has published books and maps of the location of each of his street mosaics . 
 In addition to working with tiles , Invader is one of the leading proponents of indoor mosaics created using stacks of Rubik 's Cubes in a style he refers to as " Rubikcubism " . He is also known for his QR code mosaic works . 
 = = History = = 
 Invader is a graduate of the École des Beaux @-@ Arts , a Parisian art school , though he tells interviewers he attended a tiling school on Mars . Invader initially derived inspiration for his creations from video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s that he played when he was growing up , particularly characters from Space Invaders , from which he derived his work name . Games of the era were constructed with 8 @-@ bit graphics , and so lend themselves well to the mosaic treatment , with each tile representing one pixel . Invader likes tiles for their robustness and permanence . Invader 's first mosaic was installed in the mid 1990s in his home city . It was a sleeper for several years before the full " invasion " programme was conceived in 1996 . 
 In this project , the idea is to bring the virtual world into reality . One can see many things in it , but it refers to the early days of digital and the video game . 
 The first wave of " invasion " began with his home city in 1998 , and then spread to 31 other cities in France . Since then , Invader 's works have appeared in 60 cities in 30 countries around the world . He has invaded New York five times , and Hong Kong on three separate occasions . He has tagged historic buildings and other locations . One of the more prominent places where the mosaics have been installed is on the Hollywood Sign . The first was placed on the letter D on 31 December 1999 to mark the Y2K bug . During subsequent trips to Los Angeles , Invader placed mosaics on the eight other letters of the sign . 
 In June 2011 , Invader marked the installation of his 1000th work in Paris with an exhibition at La Générale entitled " 1000 " . Since 2000 , the artist has installed in excess of 70 pieces of work dotted around Hong Kong ; the artist has declared the third wave undertaken in city , with 50 works , " probably my most accomplished city invasion wave " . By June 2011 , 77 cities have been invaded , 2 @,@ 692 Space Invaders placed comprising some 1 @.@ 5 million ceramic tiles ; 19 invasion maps have been published . Invader estimates that more than 15 % of his early pieces , ones that were small and placed rather low , have been removed . To combat their removal or damage by building owners , thieves or fans , Invader places many out of easy reach . 
 In 2012 , Invader made a short film <unk> documenting his attempt to launch one of his aliens into space on a modified weather balloon . Invader is also known for his QR code works . Created using regular black and white tiles , the patterns can be decoded using apps installed on smart phones . One decoded message reads " This is an invasion " . 
 = = Identity = = 
 Invader works incognito , often masked and largely at night . To guard his anonymity on camera during interviews , he <unk> his own image or wears a mask as a disguise . He claims that only a few people know his real name and his face , and that even his parents think he works as a <unk> in the construction industry . 
 By June 2011 , Invader had travelled around the world six times and spent 22 nights in prison cells . Invader accepts arrest as an occupational hazard . He was arrested in 2010 for placing a mosaic on the Hollywood Sign , charged with vandalism and made to pay a fine . In July 2011 , the Los Angeles Police Department detained two French nationals on suspicion of vandalism near MOCA 's Little Tokyo gallery with tile and grout in hand . The police asserted that one of them was Invader , but released the pair without charge . He was also arrested by plain @-@ clothed police in October 2013 in New York , just as he had completed installing a mural in Orchard Street in East Village in the early hours . He was again fined ; the owner of the building took down the work featuring Princess Peach and had it preserved . Invader said that whilst creating installations he had been accosted by police in Hong Kong , but was left alone once they realised he was not committing any crime . 
 = = Modus operandi = = 
 Invader sees himself as a hacker of public space spreading a virus of mosaic ; the streets are his canvas , his invasions gifts to the city and its people . He believes that museums and galleries are not accessible to everyone , so deliberately makes his works public by installing them at street level for ordinary people to enjoy on a daily basis . 
 The sites for the mosaics are not random . These are scouted and carefully researched , often with local support , and are also chosen for the visibility ( strategic ) , local interest ( aesthetic ) and symbolism ( conceptual ) they provide . Although high visibility is one objective , Invader may choose locations that are less prominent . He has said that " A spot is like a revelation ... it jumps out at you . " 
 Although many of his works feature the signature aliens , no two pieces are alike . The subject matter may also be themed and adapted to their context . Invader 's repertoire of subjects now includes Star Wars characters ( London ) , as well as the Pink Panther and Mega Man ( Paris ) . Sites near major bank buildings are marked with dollar sign mosaics . His works in Hong Kong have a more oriental theme : with some martial arts characters ; gold and red colours have been employed more often to reflect the traditional Chinese colours for fire and earth . 
 Typically , mosaics are placed ten to fifteen feet above the ground , and on street corners in areas of high visibility . He has developed methods and techniques to attain those potentially dangerous and hard @-@ to @-@ reach locations . Invader unveiled a massive Spider @-@ Man ( PA 1040 ) very high up in the 11th arrondissement April 2013 . In his invasion of Hong Kong in 2014 , he planted mosaics that featured Hong Kong Phooey , Thomas from Kung @-@ Fu Master and Popeye . 
 Invader has said : " I don 't know what ' holidays ' means because anywhere I go , I can 't resist bringing tiles and cement with me . " His mosaics are half @-@ built in advance . The weight and fragility of the tiles are constraints that influence his planning and site choices . When Invader arrives in a city , he usually stays in a city for two or three weeks . He obtains a map and spends at least a week installing the mosaics , which are catalogued ( each given an identifier with the city code and sequential number ) , photographed ( one close @-@ up and one in its context ) and mapped to indicate their locations within the city . He prints and distributes " invasion maps " within the city he is visiting , and they are later sold in his on @-@ line shop . In Montpellier , the locations of mosaics were chosen so that , when placed on a map , they form an image of a giant Space Invaders alien . 
 This catalog of the mosaics also serves as the basis of what Invader calls a " reality " game – using the " <unk> " smartphone app , players can hunt globally for installed pieces . Using the camera and geolocation functionality , users can submit photographs via the app which are then validated against the catalogued works . Successful hits or " Flashes " earn points , and the associated photos are displayed on Invader 's official website . 
 As his works have proven collector value since the 2010s , Invader adopted a new strategy to avoid his works from being removed by profiteers . In late 2015 , Invader planned a series of art pieces in New York City , putting out a call on social media for building owners who would be willing to host his mosaics legally . In addition , an additional consideration in the choice of placements include the existence of natural protections against scavengers – sites with architectural features such as recesses and blocked out windows become more attractive . Works may be larger and employ more delicate tiles so that works cannot be removed undamaged in one piece . 
 = = Rubikcubism = = 
 Since about 2004 , Invader has been working on another project that involves making artworks exclusively using Rubik 's Cubes . He may be the originator , and is certainly one of the foremost proponents of the art form he calls " Rubikcubism " . Invader takes an image from popular culture , uses a computer program to work out the precise disposition of the six colours for each image . He then manipulates nine pixels for each Rubik 's Cube to give the required pattern – taking perhaps ten seconds per cube , constructs a full image by stacking them , after which the cubes are glued to a backing board . A piece typically composed of approximately 300 cubes , measures about 0 @.@ 9 by 1 @.@ 3 metres ( 3 ft × 4 ft ) , and weighs approximately 36 kilograms ( 80 lb ) , but the exact size depends on the subject and the desired level of detail . 
 The works are themed along three axes : " Bad Men " , where he reinterprets villains such as Osama bin Laden , Jaws and Al Capone ; " Masterpieces " where famous paintings by artists such as Delacroix , Warhol , Seurat , <unk> are given a <unk> ; and " Low Fidelity " based on iconic album art such as Country Life , The Velvet Underground & Nico , and Nevermind . He has created images of the Mona Lisa and the Dalai Lama with this technique . He received a lot of attention for the 2005 portrait of Florence Rey he made with the technique , which has since been much imitated .

 In 2010 , he was one of the featured artists in the Banksy production Exit Through the Gift Shop shot by Thierry Guetta ( Mr. Brainwash ) , Invader 's cousin . In 2011 , he took part in the <unk> LA show at the Geffen Contemporary : " Art in the streets " curated by Jeffrey Deitch . His work , when sold in galleries , often fetches six @-@ figure sums . 
 Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey wrote in Swindle : 
 Invader 's pop art may seem shallow , but by taking the risk of illegally re @-@ contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer 's bedroom , he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture . In a postmodern paradox , a game like Grand Theft Auto takes the danger of the streets and puts it in a safe video game , while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into the danger of the streets . 
 Invader 's work is not universally welcomed . During his Hong Kong invasion in early 2014 , Invader installed 48 works all over the city . However , the city 's Highways Department admitted to removing at least one work later that month , taking down a roadside mosaic in Fortress Hill " to ensure safety of road users " . Local residents were disappointed , and saw the removal as an example of the government only paying lip @-@ service to promoting the arts in the city . The artist expressed his sadness , saying he " never faced a situation where a public authority would systematically and rapidly remove the art from the streets " . In early 2015 , a replica of the life @-@ sized Hong Kong Phooey ( HK 58 ) , the original of which was removed by the government a year earlier , achieved HK $ 1 @.@ 96 million ( $ 250 @,@ 000 ) at auction by Sotheby . NY 145 , featuring an invader and an old Apple Computer icon , sold for HK $ 562 @,@ 500 ( $ 72 @,@ 000 ) . 
 A solo exhibition of new and retrospective works – called " Wipe Out " – was held by the artist in May 2015 in association with the Hong Kong Contemporary Art Foundation and Le French May ,

 Idries Shah ( / <unk> <unk> / ; Pashto : <unk> شاه , Urdu : <unk> شاه , Hindi : <unk> <unk> ; 16 June 1924 – 23 November 1996 ) , also known as Idris Shah , né Sayed Idries el @-@ Hashimi ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) and by the pen name <unk> <unk> , was an author and teacher in the Sufi tradition who wrote over three dozen books on topics ranging from psychology and spirituality to travelogues and culture studies . 
 Born in India , the descendant of a family of Afghan nobles , Shah grew up mainly in England . His early writings centred on magic and witchcraft . In 1960 he established a publishing house , Octagon Press , producing translations of Sufi classics as well as titles of his own . His seminal work was The Sufis , which appeared in 1964 and was well received internationally . In 1965 , Shah founded the Institute for Cultural Research , a London @-@ based educational charity devoted to the study of human behaviour and culture . A similar organisation , the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge ( ISHK ) , exists in the United States , under the directorship of Stanford University psychology professor Robert Ornstein , whom Shah appointed as his deputy in the U.S. 
 In his writings , Shah presented Sufism as a universal form of wisdom that predated Islam . Emphasizing that Sufism was not static but always adapted itself to the current time , place and people , he framed his teaching in Western psychological terms . Shah made extensive use of traditional teaching stories and parables , texts that contained multiple layers of meaning designed to trigger insight and self @-@ reflection in the reader . He is perhaps best known for his collections of humorous Mulla Nasrudin stories . 
 Shah was at times criticized by orientalists who questioned his credentials and background . His role in the controversy surrounding a new translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , published by his friend Robert Graves and his older brother Omar Ali @-@ Shah , came in for particular scrutiny . However , he also had many notable defenders , chief among them the novelist Doris Lessing . Shah came to be recognized as a spokesman for Sufism in the West and lectured as a visiting professor at a number of Western universities . His works have played a significant part in presenting Sufism as an individualistic form of spiritual wisdom not necessarily attached to any specific religion .
