 Class II : LDLR is not properly transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus for expression on the cell surface . 
 Class III : LDLR does not properly bind LDL on the cell surface because of a defect in either apolipoprotein B100 ( <unk> ) or in LDL @-@ R. 
 Class IV : LDLR bound to LDL does not properly cluster in clathrin @-@ coated pits for receptor @-@ mediated endocytosis ( pathway step 2 ) . 
 Class V : LDLR is not recycled back to the cell surface ( pathway step 5 ) . 
 = = = <unk> B = = = 
 <unk> B , in its <unk> form , is the main apolipoprotein , or protein part of the lipoprotein particle . Its gene is located on the second chromosome ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) and is between 21 @.@ 08 and 21 @.@ 12 Mb long . FH is often associated with the mutation of <unk> , which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500 . The mutation is located on a part of the protein that normally binds with the LDL receptor , and binding is reduced as a result of the mutation . Like LDLR , the number of abnormal copies determines the severity of the hypercholesterolemia . 
 = = = PCSK9 = = = 
 Mutations in the <unk> <unk> subtilisin / <unk> type 9 ( PCSK9 ) gene were linked to autosomal dominant ( i.e. requiring only one abnormal copy ) FH in a 2003 report . The gene is located on the first chromosome ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) and encodes a 666 amino acid protein that is expressed in the liver . It has been suggested that PCSK9 causes FH mainly by reducing the number of LDL receptors on liver cells . 
 = = = LDLRAP1 = = = 
 Abnormalities in the <unk> gene , also known as LDLRAP1 , were first reported in a family in 1973 . In contrast to the other causes , two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop ( autosomal recessive ) . The mutations in the protein tend to cause the production of a shortened protein . Its real function is unclear , but it seems to play a role in the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin @-@ coated pits . People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR @-@ heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR @-@ homozygotes . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 LDL cholesterol normally circulates in the body for 2 @.@ 5 days , and subsequently the apolipoprotein B portion of LDL cholesterol binds to the LDL receptor on the liver cells , triggering its uptake and digestion . This process results in the removal of LDL from the circulatory system . Synthesis of cholesterol by the liver is suppressed in the HMG @-@ CoA reductase pathway . In FH , LDL receptor function is reduced or absent , and LDL circulates for an average duration of 4 @.@ 5 days , resulting in significantly increased level of LDL cholesterol in the blood with normal levels of other lipoproteins . In mutations of ApoB , reduced binding of LDL particles to the receptor causes the increased level of LDL cholesterol . It is not known how the mutation causes LDL receptor dysfunction in mutations of PCSK9 and <unk> . 
 Although atherosclerosis occurs to a certain degree in all people , people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to the excess level of LDL . The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends on the number of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors . In many heterozygous forms of FH , the receptor function is only mildly impaired , and LDL levels will remain relatively low . In the more serious homozygous forms , the receptor is not expressed at all . 
 Some studies of FH cohorts suggest that additional risk factors are generally at play when a person develops atherosclerosis . In addition to the classic risk factors such as smoking , high blood pressure , and diabetes , genetic studies have shown that a common abnormality in the prothrombin gene ( G20210A ) increases the risk of cardiovascular events in people with FH . Several studies found that a high level of lipoprotein ( a ) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease . The risk was also found to be higher in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) . 
 = = Screening = = 
 Screening among family members of people with known FH is cost @-@ effective . Other strategies such as universal screening at the age of 16 have also been suggested . The latter approach may however be less cost @-@ effective in the short term . Screening at an age lower than 16 would lead to an unacceptably high rate of false positives . 
 A 2007 meta analysis found that , " The proposed strategy of screening children and parents for familial hypercholesterolaemia could have considerable impact in preventing the medical consequences of this disorder in two generations simultaneously . " " The use of total cholesterol alone may best discriminate between people with and without FH between the ages of 1 to 9 years . " 
 = = Treatment = = 
 = = = Heterozygous FH = = = 
 FH is usually treated with statins . Statins act by inhibiting the enzyme <unk> CoA reductase ( HMG @-@ CoA @-@ reductase ) in the liver . In response , the liver produces more LDL receptors , which remove circulating LDL from the blood . Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels , although sometimes add @-@ on therapy with other drugs is required , such as bile acid sequestrants ( <unk> or <unk> ) , nicotinic acid preparations or <unk> . Control of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease is required , as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled . Professional guidelines recommend that the decision to treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools ( such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study ) , as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease ; unlike the rest of the population , FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth , probably increasing their relative risk . Prior to the introduction of the statins , <unk> ( an older <unk> that often caused gallstones ) , <unk> ( especially in large xanthomas ) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels . 
 More controversial is the addition of <unk> , which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut . While it reduces LDL cholesterol , it does not appear to improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the intima @-@ media thickness . Whether this means that <unk> is of no overall benefit in FH is unknown . 
 There are no interventional studies that directly show mortality benefit of cholesterol lowering in FH . Rather , evidence of benefit is derived from a number of trials conducted in people who have polygenic hypercholesterolemia ( in which heredity plays a smaller role ) . Still , a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that mortality in people with FH had started to improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced . 
 A cohort study suggested that treatment of FH with statins leads to a 48 % reduction in death from coronary heart disease to a point where people are no more likely to die of coronary heart disease than the general population . However , if the person already had coronary heart disease the reduction was 25 % . The results emphasize the importance of early identification of FH and treatment with statins . 
 <unk> and <unk> , both monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 , are specifically indicated as adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia , who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol . 
 = = = Homozygous FH = = = 
 Homozygous FH is harder to treat . The LDL receptors are minimally functional , if at all . Only high doses of statins , often in combination with other medications , are modestly effective in improving lipid levels . If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels , LDL apheresis may be used ; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis . Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant ; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors , and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels , but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant ( such as rejection , infections , or side @-@ effects of the medication required to suppress rejection ) . Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery , in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol , and <unk> shunt surgery , in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver . 
 <unk> , an inhibitor of the <unk> triglyceride transfer protein , was approved by the US FDA in December 2012 as an orphan drug for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia . In January 2013 , The US FDA also approved <unk> , which inhibits the action of the gene apolipoprotein B , for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia . Gene therapy is a possible future alternative . 
 = = = Children = = = 
 Given that FH is present from birth and <unk> changes may begin early in life , it is sometimes necessary to treat adolescents or even teenagers with agents that were originally developed for adults . Due to safety concerns , many physicians prefer to use bile acid sequestrants and <unk> as these are licensed in children . Nevertheless , statins seem safe and effective , and in older children may be used as in adults . 
 An expert panel in 2006 advised on early combination therapy with LDL apheresis , statins and cholesterol absorption inhibitors in children with homozygous FH at the highest risk . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 The global prevalence of FH is approximately 10 million people . In most populations studied , heterozygous FH occurs in about 1 : 500 people , but not all develop symptoms . Homozygous FH occurs in about 1 : 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . 
 LDLR mutations are more common in certain populations , presumably because of a genetic phenomenon known as the founder effect — they were founded by a small group of individuals , one or several of whom was a carrier of the mutation . The Afrikaner , French Canadians , Lebanese Christians , and Finns have high rates of specific mutations that make FH particularly common in these groups . <unk> mutations are more common in Central Europe . 
 = = History = = 
 The Norwegian physician Dr C. Müller first associated the physical signs , high cholesterol levels and autosomal dominant inheritance in 1938 . In the early 1970s and 1980s , the genetic cause for FH was described by Dr Joseph L. Goldstein and Dr Michael S. Brown of Dallas , Texas . Initially , they found increased activity of HMG @-@ CoA reductase , but studies showed that this did not explain the very abnormal cholesterol levels in people with FH . The focus shifted to the binding of LDL to its receptor , and effects of impaired binding on metabolism ; this proved to be the underlying mechanism for FH . Subsequently numerous mutations in the protein were directly identified by sequencing . They later won the 1985 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discovery of the LDL receptor and its impact on lipoprotein metabolism . 
 = West Pier = 
 The West Pier is a pier in Brighton , England . It was designed by Eugenius Birch , opening in 1866 and closing in 1975 . The pier was the first to be Grade I listed in Britain but has become increasingly derelict since closure . 
 The pier was constructed during a boom in pleasure pier building in the 1860s , and was designed to attract tourism in Brighton . It was the town 's second pier , joining the Royal Suspension Chain Pier of 1823 . It was extended in 1893 , and a concert hall was added in 1916 . The pier reached its peak attendance during this time , with 2 million visitors between 1918 and 1919 . Its popularity began to decline after World War II , and concerts were replaced by a funfair and tearoom . A local company took ownership in 1965 , but could not meet the increased maintenance cost , and ultimately filed for bankruptcy . They could not find a suitable buyer , so the pier closed in 1975 and subsequently fell into disrepair . 
 The West Pier Trust now owns the pier and has proposed various plans to renovate it . Some schemes have been opposed by local residents and the owners of the nearby Palace Pier , who have claimed unfair competition . The pier gradually collapsed during the early 21st century . Major sections collapsed in late 2002 , and two fires in March and May 2003 left little of the original structure . Subsequently , English Heritage declared it to be beyond repair . Structured demolition took place in 2010 to make way for the observation tower <unk> ; further structural damage from storms has occurred since .

 = = = 19th century = = = 
 The West Pier was constructed during a boom in pleasure pier building in the 1860s , during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain . It was designed by architect Eugenius Birch as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air . Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction , complaining that the planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil the view of the sea from their homes . It was felt that the pier would have a positive effect on property values in the town , so the pier was approved . Construction began in 1863 and the pier opened to the public on 6 October 1866 . 
 The pier had a length of 1 @,@ 115 feet ( 340 m ) and a width of 310 feet ( 94 m ) at the pierhead . It was built with cast iron threaded columns screwed into the seabed . The superstructure 's ironwork was manufactured by Robert Laidlaw , featuring an " oriental " style . Upon opening , the pier was fitted with gas lamps with ornamental serpent designs , which had been directly influenced by similar examples inside the nearby Royal Pavilion . The pier had ornamental houses , two toll houses and glass screens at the pierhead to protect visitors from the weather . A New Scientist report covering Britain 's piers called the pier Birch 's " masterpiece " . 
 In 1893 , the pierhead was extended under the supervision of Birch 's nephew , Peregrine , who added a pavilion with a capacity for 1400 people . After the Royal Suspension Chain Pier was demolished following a storm in 1896 , the West Pier became the only one on Brighton 's seafront until the construction of the Palace Pier . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 In April 1900 , seven sailors from HMS Desperate drowned in bad weather as they approached the pier . 
 By the early 20th century , the earlier priority of good sea air on the pier had been replaced with a desire for public entertainment . The pier reached record levels of attendance in the early 20th century , attracting around 1 @.@ 5 million visitors between 1910 and 1911 . Attendance fell due to the onset of World War I , but resumed afterwards , with around 2 million people visiting between 1918 and 1919 . 
 Competition with the Palace Pier led to a new concert hall , designed by local architects Clayton & Black . The 19th century bandstand was demolished between 1914 and 1916 . It was replaced by an eight @-@ sided grand concert hall , constructed from cast @-@ iron arches . It opened on 20 April 1916 with a concert by the King 's Royal Rifles silver band , made up of war veterans . 
 The concert hall had its own in @-@ house orchestra by November , and ticket sales for concerts accounted for 43 % of the pier 's revenue by 1920 . The West Pier was favoured by locals , while the Palace Pier was used more by day trippers . A top @-@ deck entrance was added to the hall in 1932 . The pier 's central decking was removed during World War II to prevent enemy landings , and its popularity began to decline . On 26 November 1944 a Royal Air Force Hawker Typhoon fighter hit the pier , crashing onto the beach . The pilot sustained head injuries . The Typhoon was one of four aircraft escorting a VIP flight . 
 The concert hall was converted into a tea room and the theatre redesigned as a restaurant in the early 1950s . A funfair was added around the same time . By the 1960s , the pier was suffering from serious financial difficulties . In 1965 , it was bought by a company that owned some seafront hotels and entertainment venues . They had ambitions for the pier but were unable to cope with increasing maintenance costs . Some portions of wood and iron from the pier fell on the beach , and the pierhead was closed in 1970 due to safety concerns . The pier was Grade II listed in 1969 and the council served compulsory repair notices , but the company was unable to afford them and opted for voluntary liquidation . The remainder of the pier was closed in 1975 when the Brighton Corporation declined to buy it , passing control to the Crown Estates Commissioners . 
 = = Restoration = = 
 After 1975 , various attempts were made to restore the pier . Supporters complained that the council was more interested in developing Brighton Marina . In 1982 , the pier became the only one in Britain to be awarded Grade I listed status . The West Pier Trust was formed to save the pier , and bought it from the council in 1983 for a peppercorn fee of £ 100 , though the council also demanded £ 800 @,@ 000 required for immediate repairs before it could be opened to the public . A proposal to restore the pier with a 60 @-@ metre ( 200 ft ) <unk> wheel failed after the backer went bankrupt . 
 The pier suffered structural damage due to the Great Storm of 1987 , and access from the shore was removed for safety reasons in 1991 . The West Pier Trust continued to offer regular tours of the pier throughout the 1990s . In 1998 , the National Lottery pledged £ 14 million to restore the pier , but the West Pier Trust was unable to find a suitable partner to help with restoration . The owners of the Palace Pier , who had become financially self @-@ sufficient under their own means , claimed unfair competition . In 2001 , English Heritage identified the pier as the most at @-@ risk Grade I listed structure in the United Kingdom . 
 = = Decline and damage = = 
 In December 2002 , the pier partially collapsed during a storm , when a walkway connecting the concert hall and pavilion fell into the sea . The following month , the concert hall in the middle of the pier fell over , leaving the entire structure close to total collapse . 
 On 28 March 2003 the pavilion at the pierhead caught fire . Fire crews were unable to save the building from destruction because the collapsed walkway prevented them from reaching it . The cause of the fire remains unknown , since fire investigators were unable to access the site for safety reasons . A more severe fire burned through 11 and 12 May 2003 , consuming most of what was left of the concert hall . On 23 June 2004 , high winds caused the middle of the pier to collapse completely . The following month , English Heritage declared the pier to be beyond repair . 
 Despite these setbacks , the West Pier Trust remained adamant that they would soon begin full restoration work . Retired boxer Chris Eubank criticised the delays in restoring the pier , saying he could raise the money himself in six months . In December 2004 , the Trust confirmed the restoration would not be going ahead after their plans were rejected by the Heritage Lottery Fund . The pier was partially demolished in February 2010 , partly to make way for the planned <unk> observation tower . In February 2014 , due to stormy weather , the pier split in half and a large part of the centre fell into the sea . Waves swept away the eastern side of the damaged metal skeleton , which remained after the 2003 fire . A selection of artefacts rescued from the pier is exhibited in the Brighton Fishing Museum . A further section of the pier collapsed in 2016 . 
 = = Media appearances = = 
 The pier can be seen in several films , including Oh ! What a Lovely War ( 1968 ) and Carry On Girls ( 1973 ) which was filmed on the pier and in locations nearby in Brighton . It was also prominently featured in the French comedy La Course à l <unk> ( 1975 ) , starring Pierre Richard and Jane Birkin . 
 In Nick Cave 's novel The Death of Bunny Munro , Bunny 's son speculates on a reason for the 2003 fires . The band James filmed the video for " Just Like Fred Astaire " on and around the West Pier . 
 = Selina Meyer = 
 Selina Catherine Meyer ( née Eaton ) is a fictional character portrayed by Julia Louis @-@ Dreyfus on the HBO television comedy series Veep . Louis @-@ Dreyfus has been critically acclaimed for the role , earning a record @-@ tying four consecutive Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series awards and four Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy nominations . 
 Meyer is a former United States Senator and Vice President of the United States following an unsuccessful run for President . During the first season , as Vice President she was powerless and disregarded by most other important officials , leading to various humiliations and indignities . During the second season she begins to amass some power and influence . In the third season , she contemplates challenging the incumbent president for their unnamed party 's nomination in light of his political weakness , but the issue is mooted when he abruptly resigns , allowing her to become the president . In the fourth season , she has assumed office but is facing strong primary and general @-@ election challengers of her own . The general election results in a tie , setting the stage for the fifth season , as the House of Representatives prepares to choose the president . 
 The role garnered Louis @-@ Dreyfus several milestone accolades : Her fourteenth Primetime Emmy Award nomination for a role in the regular cast of a comedy series surpassed Lucille Ball as the most ever . Her Primetime Emmy Award for her third different regular cast role also was a record @-@ setting achievement for a comedy actress . Her four consecutive Primetime Emmy Lead Actress wins tied a record and her five overall Primetime Emmy Lead Actress wins also tied a record . 
 = = Fictional biography = = 
 Meyer was born Selina Catherine Eaton to mother Catherine Calvert Eaton and Gordon Dunn Eaton . In her childhood , she loved her father ( whom she affectionately called Daddy ) , but resented her narcissistic mother . Her father died when she was 12 , and she claims that her mother blamed Selina for his death . 
 The show 's original opening sequence details some of her career . She was a United States Senator from Maryland ( where she was born and raised ) . She announced her candidacy for the 2012 presidential election . Media outlets initially praised her and had high hopes for her becoming the President , with headlines such as " Magic Meyer " and " Is this Meyer 's Moment ? " . Despite strong initial victories , she ultimately is defeated by primary challenger Stuart Hughes on Super Tuesday , and suspends her campaign . He then selects her as his running mate , and is elected to the presidency . 
 As the Vice President , Meyer found herself increasingly ignored by the President , and often demoted to trivial matters . When the sitting President decides that he will not seek a second term , his Chief of Staff Ben Cafferty encourages Meyer to run , which she ultimately does . She faces a primary challenge from war veteran and governor Danny Chung , Secretary of Defense George Maddox , Congressman Owen Pierce , and baseball coach Joe Thornhill . During the course of the primary season , President Hughes resigns abruptly to care for his ailing wife , and Meyer ascends to the presidency . Headlines question whether Meyer will be " the 8 @-@ month president " , confirming that Hughes ' term was near over , and Meyer is constitutionally eligible to serve two full terms as President . Though she chooses Senator Andrew Doyle to become her Vice President , he declines to serve as her running mate for a full term as Vice President . She offers the running mate position to both Chung and Maddox , but both decline , and she ultimately chooses popular Senator Tom James when she secures the party nomination . 
 Meyer is challenged in the general election by Southern Senator Jim O 'Brien . The election ends in an electoral college tie , but with Meyer having won the popular vote . After an ambiguous result in Nevada , the Meyer camp successfully campaigns for a recount . The recount backfires , and O 'Brien keeps Nevada as a victory , as well as overtakes the popular vote . Congress must then decide who will be the President . After the House of Representatives fails to elect the President , Meyer agrees to be Vice President for her running mate Tom James , however the Senate instead elects O 'Brien 's running mate Laura Montez as President . As a result , James makes plans to return to the private sector while Meyer , now completely out of office , contemplates her future . 
 = = Character = = 
 The show 's premise is that Meyer is a former United States Senator who runs a failed Presidential campaign before being asked to be the winning candidate 's Vice President . As Vice President , her world is kept in balance by her assistants : Amy <unk> ( Anna Chlumsky ) is the Vice President 's chief of staff , while Gary Walsh ( Tony Hale ) is Meyer 's grovelling personal aide . Selina also hires Dan Egan ( Reid Scott ) , who threatens Amy 's place in the staff , and Mike McLintock ( Matt Walsh ) , a press spokesman . Meyer has no significant other , and requires that her daughter Catherine , from a past marriage , make appointments to see her . 
 Some suggest that Meyer is likely a Republican , while others feel she is a Democrat . Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes that Meyer 's party affiliation is unknown because the show focuses on bullying and ego rather than ideology . James Poniewozik of Time explains the ambiguity as follows : Veep is " almost all politics and almost no political issues " . Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times explains the lack of need for party affiliations , or even political ideology in a similar manner , saying that Veep is " less a show about politics than about politicking . " In an interview with The New Yorker Radio Hour , Julia Louis @-@ Dreyfus suggested that Meyer 's associated political party is intentionally left unknown to the audience . Louis @-@ Dreyfus later elaborated : " [ Selina Meyer 's ] politics are all about her and staying alive ... she will hold any position if it keeps her in office . " In the episode Election Night , CNN represents states won by Meyer as blue . In the same episode , she also comments winning the ' blue wall ' states of Connecticut and Vermont with " A bowl of hair could win those states " . 
 Poniewozik describes the season 1 Meyer as a " bumbling and overwhelmed " shadow of her former self . <unk> Marr of The Wall Street Journal describes Meyer as " inept " . James Parker of The New York Times describes her as animated , powerless , prone to fits , and at times distracted . He notes that she motorcades and entourages with importance , but also passes time rotating dreamily in her swivel chair . Parker opines that Meyer " swears her head off " because that is what the modern " gaffe @-@ phobic , linguistically constipated " public servant who has sold his / her soul to a lobbyist group does behind closed doors after public speeches about " ceaseless , toneless platitudes " . Variety television critic Brian Lowry describes Meyer as " easily flustered , foul @-@ mouthed " , saying that her " over @-@ reliance on profanity " is a comedic crutch . David Renshaw of The Guardian describes Meyer as " a perfect combination of ineptness and amorality " . 
 T. A. Frank of The New Republic says that in season 1 she is completely ignored by the president and dismissed by Congress as she endures repeated indignities with a high degree of cynicism . According to Frank , Meyer slowly gains some respect and power , but it is not without effort . Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker , noted that the premise of a politician without influence striving for it suited itself well to a comedy and that her frequent cursing should not have been much of an issue given that it was an HBO production . Laura Bennett of The New Republic states that in season 1 Meyer is " a hapless buffoon , <unk> her hair and running in circles " , who endures marginalization and irrelevance , but in season 2 , which is set during midterm elections , she is " a player in the administration with concrete involvement in foreign policy " . By season 3 , presidential candidate Meyer becomes fashion conscious on the campaign trail . In the third season finale , the President resigns , leaving Meyer in charge ; however , her position is threatened when she loses the first presidential primary . Following a congressional inquiry into a data breach in which Meyer and other White House employees must testify , Meyer eventually rebounds with the help of new running mate Tom James . However , during the season four finale , the election ends in a tie between Meyer and senator Bill O 'Brien , putting Meyer 's future as president in jeopardy . Ending on a cliffhanger , what will happen , including when the Electoral College meets and perhaps things being thrown to Congress pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment , is left to the upcoming Fifth Season .

 = Robert Hues = 
 Robert Hues ( 1553 – 24 May 1632 ) was an English mathematician and geographer . He attended St. Mary Hall at Oxford , and graduated in 1578 . Hues became interested in geography and mathematics , and studied navigation at a school set up by Walter Raleigh . During a trip to Newfoundland , he made observations which caused him to doubt the accepted published values for variations of the compass . Between 1586 and 1588 , Hues travelled with Thomas Cavendish on a circumnavigation of the globe , performing astronomical observations and taking the latitudes of places they visited . Beginning in August 1591 , Hues and Cavendish again set out on another circumnavigation of the globe . During the voyage , Hues made astronomical observations in the South Atlantic , and continued his observations of the variation of the compass at various latitudes and at the Equator . Cavendish died on the journey in 1592 , and Hues returned to England the following year . 
 In 1594 , Hues published his discoveries in the Latin work Tractatus de globis et eorum usu ( Treatise on Globes and Their Use ) which was written to explain the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes that had been made and published by Emery Molyneux in late 1592 or early 1593 , and to encourage English sailors to use practical astronomical navigation . Hues ' work subsequently went into at least 12 other printings in Dutch , English , French and Latin . 
 Hues continued to have dealings with Raleigh in the 1590s , and later became a servant of Thomas Grey , 15th Baron Grey de Wilton . While Grey was imprisoned in the Tower of London for participating in the Bye Plot , Hues stayed with him . Following Grey 's death in 1614 , Hues attended upon Henry Percy , the 9th Earl of Northumberland , when he was confined in the Tower ; one source states that Hues , Thomas Harriot and Walter Warner were Northumberland 's constant companions and known as his " Three Magi " , although this is disputed . Hues tutored Northumberland 's son Algernon Percy ( who was to become the 10th Earl of Northumberland ) at Oxford , and subsequently ( in 1622 – 1623 ) Algernon 's younger brother Henry . In later years , Hues lived in Oxford where he was a fellow of the University , and discussed mathematics and related subjects with like @-@ minded friends . He died on 24 May 1632 in the city and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral .

English antiquarian Anthony à Wood ( 1632 – 1695 ) wrote that when Hues arrived at Oxford he was " only a poor scholar or servitor ... he continued for some time a very sober and serious servant ... but being sensible of the loss of time which he sustained there by constant attendance , he transferred himself to St Mary 's Hall " . Hues graduated with a Bachelor of Arts ( B.A. ) degree on 12 July 1578 , having shown marked skill in Greek . He later gave advice to the dramatist and poet George Chapman for his 1616 English translation of Homer , and Chapman referred to him as his " learned and valuable friend " . According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography , there is unsubstantiated evidence that after completing his degree Hues was held in the Tower of London , though no reason is given for this , then went abroad after his release . It is possible he travelled to Continental Europe . 
 Hues was a friend of the geographer Richard Hakluyt , who was then regent master of Christ Church . In the 1580s , Hakluyt introduced him to Walter Raleigh and explorers and navigators whom Raleigh knew . In addition , it is likely that Hues came to know astronomer and mathematician Thomas Harriot and Walter Warner at Thomas Allen 's lectures in mathematics . The four men were later associated with Henry Percy , the 9th Earl of Northumberland , who was known as the " Wizard Earl " for his interest in scientific and alchemical experiments and his library .

 Hues became interested in geography and mathematics – an undated source indicates that he disputed accepted values of variations of the compass after making observations off the Newfoundland coast . He either went there on a fishing trip , or may have joined a 1585 voyage to Virginia arranged by Raleigh and led by Richard Grenville , which passed Newfoundland on the return journey to England . Hues perhaps become acquainted with the sailor Thomas Cavendish at this time , as both of them were taught by Harriot at Raleigh 's school of navigation . An anonymous 17th @-@ century manuscript states that Hues circumnavigated the world with Cavendish between 1586 and 1588 " purposely for taking the true Latitude of places " ; he may have been the " NH " who wrote a brief account of the voyage that was published by Hakluyt in his 1589 work The Principall Navigations , Voiages , and Discoveries of the English Nation . In the year that book appeared , Hues was with Edward Wright on the Earl of Cumberland 's raiding expedition to the Azores to capture Spanish galleons . 
 Beginning in August 1591 , Hues joined Cavendish on another attempt to circumnavigate the globe . Sailing on the Leicester , they were accompanied by the explorer John Davis on the Desire . Cavendish and Davis agreed that they would part company once they had cleared the Strait of Magellan between Chile and Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego , as Davis intended to sail to America to search for the Northwest Passage . The expedition was ultimately unsuccessful , although Davis did discover the Falkland Islands . In the meantime , delayed in small harbours in the Strait with crew members dying from the cold , illness and starvation , Cavendish turned back eastwards to return to England . He was plagued by mutinous crewmen , and also by natives and Portuguese who attacked his sailors seeking food and water on shore . Increasingly depressed , Cavendish died in 1592 somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean , possibly a suicide . 
 During the voyage , Hues made astronomical observations of the Southern Cross and other stars of the Southern Hemisphere while in the South Atlantic , and also observed the variation of the compass there and at the Equator . He returned to England with Davis in 1593 , and published his discoveries in the work Tractatus de globis et eorum usu ( Treatise on Globes and Their Use , 1594 ) , which he dedicated to Raleigh . The book was written to explain the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes that had been made and published by Emery Molyneux in late 1592 or early 1593 . Apparently , the book was also intended to encourage English sailors to use practical astronomical navigation , although Lesley Cormack has observed that the fact it was written in Latin suggests that it was aimed at scholarly readers on the Continent . In 1595 , William Sanderson , a London merchant who had largely financed the globes ' construction , presented a small globe together with Hues ' " Latin booke that <unk> the use of my great globes " to Robert Cecil , a statesman who was spymaster and minister to Elizabeth I and James I. Hues ' work subsequently went into at least 12 other printings in Dutch ( 1597 , 1613 and 1622 ) , English ( 1638 and 1659 ) , French ( 1618 ) and Latin ( 1611 , 1613 , 1617 , 1627 , 1659 and 1663 ) . In his book An Accidence or The Path @-@ way to Experience : Necessary for all Young Sea @-@ men ( 1626 ) , John Smith , who founded the first permanent English settlement in North America at Jamestown , Virginia , listed Hues ' book among the works that a young seaman should study . 
 Tractatus de globis begins with a letter by Hues dedicated to Raleigh that recalled geographical discoveries made by Englishmen during Elizabeth I 's reign . However , he felt that his countrymen would have surpassed the Spaniards and Portuguese if they had a complete knowledge of astronomy and geometry , which were essential to successful navigation . In the preface of the book , Hues rehearsed arguments that proved the earth is a sphere , and refuted opposing theories . The treatise was divided into five parts . The first part described elements common to Molyneux 's terrestrial and celestial globes , including the circles and lines inscribed on them , zones and climates , and the use of each globe 's wooden horizon circle and brass meridian . The second part described planets , fixed stars and constellations ; while the third part described the lands and seas shown on the terrestrial globe , and discussed the length of the circumference of the earth and of a degree of a great circle . Part 4 , which Hues considered the most important part of the work , explained how the globes enabled seamen to determine the sun 's position , latitude , course and distance , amplitudes and <unk> , and time and declination . The final part of the work contained a treatise inspired by Harriot on rhumb lines . In the work , Hues also published for the first time the six fundamental navigational propositions involved in solving what was later termed the " nautical triangle " used for plane sailing . Difference of latitude and departure ( or longitude ) are two sides of the triangle forming a right angle , the distance travelled is the hypotenuse , and the angle between difference of latitude and distance is the course . If any two elements are known , the other two can be determined by plotting or calculation using tables of sines , tangents and <unk> . 
 In the 1590s , Hues continued to have dealings with Raleigh – he was one of the executors of Raleigh 's will – and he may have been the " Hewes " who dined with Northumberland regularly in 1591 . He later became a servant of Thomas Grey , the 15th and last Baron Grey de Wilton ( 1575 – 1614 ) . For participating in the Bye Plot , a conspiracy by Roman Catholic priest William Watson to kidnap James I and force him to repeal anti @-@ Catholic legislation , Grey was attainted and forfeited his title in 1603 . The following year , he was imprisoned in the Tower of London . Grey was given consent for Hues to stay in the Tower with him . Between 1605 and 1621 , Northumberland was also confined in the Tower ; he was suspected of involvement in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 because his relative Thomas Percy was among the conspirators . 
 In 1616 , following Grey 's death , Hues began to be " attendant upon th <unk> Earle of Northumberland for matters of learning " , and was paid a yearly sum of £ 40 to support his research until Northumberland 's death in 1632 . Wood stated that Harriot , Hues and Warner were Northumberland 's " constant companions , and were usually called the Earl of Northumberland 's Three Magi . They had a table at the Earl 's charge , and the Earl himself did constantly converse with them , and with Sir Walter Raleigh , then in the Tower " . Together with the scientist Nathanael <unk> and the mathematician Thomas Allen , the men kept abreast of developments in astronomy , mathematics , physiology and the physical sciences , and made important contributions in these areas . According to the letter writer John Chamberlain , Northumberland refused a pardon offered to him in 1617 , preferring to remain with Harriot , Hues and Warner . However , the fact that these companions of Northumberland were his " Three Magi " studying with him in the Tower of London has been regarded as a romanticisation by the antiquarian John Aubrey and disputed for lack of evidence . Hues was tutor to Northumberland 's sons : first Algernon Percy , who subsequently became the 10th Earl of Northumberland , at Oxford where he matriculated at Christ Church in 1617 ; and later Algernon 's younger brother Henry in 1622 – 1623 . Hues lived at Christ Church at this time , but may have occasionally attended upon Northumberland at Petworth House in Petworth , West Sussex , and at Syon House in London after the latter 's release from the Tower in 1622 . Hues sometimes met Walter Warner in London , and they are known to have discussed the reflection of bodies . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In later years , Hues lived in Oxford where he discussed mathematics and allied subjects with like @-@ minded friends . Cormack states he was a fellow at the University . Under the terms of the will of Thomas Harriot , who died on 2 July 1621 , Hues and Warner were given the responsibility of helping Harriot 's executor Nathaniel <unk> to prepare Harriot 's mathematical papers for publication . Hues was also required to help price Harriot 's books and other possessions for sale to the Bodleian Library . 
 Hues , who did not marry , died on 24 May 1632 in Stone House , St. Aldate 's ( opposite the Blue Boar in central Oxford ) . This was the house of John Smith , M.A. , the son of a cook at Christ Church named J. Smith . In his will , Hues made many small bequests to his friends , including a sum of £ 20 to his " kinswoman " Mary Holly ( of whom nothing is known ) , and 20 nobles to each of her three sisters . He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral , and a monumental brass to him was placed in Christ Church with the following inscription :

 [ Here lies a highly lettered man , of the highest moral and religious integrity , Robert Hues , on account of his erudition in all subjects , both Theology and History , and Rhetoric , Philology , and Philosophy , but especially Mathematics ( of which a notable volume [ i.e. , his book ] remains in print ) . He was most closely associated with Thomas Cavendish , in whose company he explored the world by sail ; then with Lord Baron Gray , for whom he came as <unk> in the Tower of London . When Gray died , he was summoned to study in the same place with Henry Earl of Northumberland , to teach his son , and when he had worked for some years in this Church [ i.e. , Christ Church Cathedral ] , and had decided that the place next to the School [ i.e. , Christ Church , Oxford ] was suitable for his health in his old age , he breathed his last at the house of John Smith , his body exhausted , but with a lively spirit , on 24 May , in the year of our salvation 1632 , at the age of 79 . ]

 Eyes Without a Face ( French : Les yeux sans visage ) is a 1960 French @-@ Italian horror film adaptation of Jean Redon 's novel , directed by Georges Franju , and starring Pierre Brasseur and Alida Valli . During the film 's production , consideration was given to the standards of European censors by setting the right tone , minimizing gore and eliminating the mad @-@ scientist character . Although the film passed through the European censors , the film 's release in Europe caused controversy nevertheless . Critical reaction ranged from praise to disgust . 
 The film received an American debut in an edited and dubbed form in 1962 under the title of The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus . In the United States , Faustus was released as a double feature with The <unk> ( 1959 ) . The film 's initial critical reception was not overtly positive , but subsequent theatrical and home video re @-@ releases increased its reputation . Modern critics praise the film today for its poetic nature as well as being a notable influence on other filmmakers . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At night just outside Paris , a woman drives along a riverbank and dumps a corpse in the river . After the body is recovered , Dr. Génessier identifies the remains as those of his missing daughter , Christiane Génessier , whose face was horribly disfigured in an automobile accident that occurred before her disappearance , for which her father was responsible . Dr. Génessier lives in a large mansion , which is adjacent to his clinic , with numerous caged German Shepherds and other large dogs . 
 Following Christiane 's funeral , Dr. Génessier and his assistant Louise , the woman who had disposed of the dead body earlier , return home where the real Christiane is hidden ( it is explained that Louise is <unk> loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face , leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker ) . The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier 's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter 's . Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane 's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement . After her father leaves the room , Christiane calls her fiancé Jacques Vernon , who works with Dr. Génessier at his clinic , but hangs up without saying a word . 
 Louise lures a young Swiss girl named Edna <unk> to Génessier 's home . Génessier <unk> Edna and takes her to his secret laboratory . Christiane secretly watches her father and Louise carry Edna to the lab , and then goes to tenderly caress the dogs her father keeps caged , who eagerly accept her love , and are unaffected by her appearance . 
 Dr. Génessier performs <unk> surgery , removing Edna 's face . The doctor successfully grafts the skin onto his daughter 's face and holds the heavily bandaged and faceless Edna against her will . Edna escapes , but falls to her death from an upstairs window . After disposing of Edna 's corpse , Génessier notices flaws on Christiane 's face . Her face grows worse within days ; the new tissue is being rejected and she must resort to wearing her mask again . Christiane again phones Jacques and this time says his name , but the phone call is interrupted by Louise . 
 Jacques reports the call to the police , who have been investigating the disappearance of several young women with blue eyes and similar facial characteristics . The police have gained a lead concerning a woman who wears a pearl choker , whom Jacques recognizes as Louise . Inspector Parot , an officer investigating Edna 's disappearance , coerces a young woman named Paulette <unk> ( recently arrested for shoplifting ) to help investigate by checking herself into Génessier 's clinic . After being declared healthy , Paulette leaves for Paris and is promptly picked up by Louise , who delivers her to Dr. Génessier . Génessier is about to begin surgery on Paulette when Louise informs him that the police want to see him . 
 While the doctor talks with the police , Christiane , who has long been disenchanted with her father 's experiments , and has been slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation , frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck . She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments . Dr. Génessier dismisses the police ( who readily accept his explanations ) and returns to his lab , where an abandoned German Shepherd he 'd only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him , inciting the other dogs to follow suit — maddened by pain and confinement , they maul him to death , disfiguring his face in the process . Christiane , unmoved by her father 's death , and seemingly transformed into something more than human , walks slowly into the woods outside Génessier 's house with one of the freed doves on her hand . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Pierre Brasseur as Doctor Génessier , a University professor , physician and father of Christiane . Génessier experiments on his pet dogs and performs <unk> surgeries on women to try and restore the face of his daughter Christiane . Brasseur previously worked with director Georges Franju in the drama , La Tête contre les murs ( 1958 ) , again in a leading role playing a doctor . 
 Edith Scob as Christiane Génessier , Doctor Génessier 's daughter . Christiane 's face was damaged in a car accident caused by her father . For most of the film , her face is covered by a stiff mask that resembles her face before the accident . Like Brasseur , Scob was also cast by Franju in La Tête Contre les Murs , but in a minor role . Scob later worked with Franju on four other films . 
 Alida Valli as Louise , a woman who is Génessier 's assistant , kidnaps young women , assists him in the laboratory and acts as a surrogate mother to Christiane . Louise aids Génessier partly because of his help in restoring her damaged face in events that happened before the film begins . 
 François Guérin as Jacques Vernon , a student of Génessier and Christiane 's fiancé . Jacques is unaware of Doctor Génessier 's criminal activity and believes Christiane is dead . After receiving a phone call from Christiane , he helps the police in investigating the crime . 
 Juliette <unk> as Edna <unk> , a young woman who becomes a victim of Doctor Génessier experiments after being befriended by Louise in Paris . Edna is the first woman whose face is successfully transplanted to Christiane . While recovering from the surgery , she attacks Louise and then leaps from a window at Génessier 's home and dies . 
 Alexandre <unk> as Inspector Parot , a police inspector investigating the disappearances of Génessier 's victims . Parot ultimately discovers that all of the missing girls have similar features . 
 Béatrice <unk> as Paulette <unk> , a young woman who is taken into police custody after being caught shoplifting . Due to a resemblance with the women Génessier has kidnapped , she is informed by Parot that the charges against her will be dropped if she checks into Génessier 's clinic . She is subsequently released and kidnapped to have her face transplanted , but is saved by Christiane before Génessier is able to perform surgery on her .

 In the late 1950s , British horror films such as The Curse of Frankenstein ( 1957 ) and Horror of Dracula ( 1958 ) were popular with French filmgoers . At the time , similar modern horror films had not been attempted by French film makers until producer Jules Borkon decided to tap into the horror market . Borkon bought the rights to the Redon novel and offered the directorial role to one of the founders of Cinémathèque Française , Franju , who was directing his first non @-@ documentary feature La Tête contre les murs ( 1958 ) . Franju had grown up during the French silent @-@ film era when filmmakers such as Georges Méliès and Louis <unk> were making fantastique @-@ themed films , and he relished the opportunity to contribute to the genre . Franju felt the story was not a horror film ; rather , he described his vision of the film as one of " anguish ... it 's a quieter mood than horror ... more internal , more penetrating . It 's horror in homeopathic doses . " 
 To avoid problems with European censors , Borkon cautioned Franju not to include too much blood ( which would upset French censors ) , refrain from showing animals getting tortured ( which would upset English censors ) and leave out mad @-@ scientist characters ( which would upset German censors ) . All three of these were part of the novel , presenting a challenge to find the right tone for presenting these story elements in the film . First , working with Claude Sautet who was also serving as first assistant director and who laid out the preliminary screenplay , Franju hired the writing team of Boileau @-@ Narcejac ( Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac ) who had written novels adapted as Henri @-@ Georges Clouzot 's Les Diaboliques ( 1955 ) and Alfred Hitchcock 's Vertigo ( 1958 ) . The writers shifted the novel 's focus from Doctor Génessier 's character to that of his daughter , Christiane ; this shift revealed the doctor 's character in a more positive and understandable light and helped to avoid the censorship restrictions . 
 For his production staff , Franju enlisted people with whom he had previously worked on earlier projects . Cinematographer Eugen Schüfftan , best remembered for developing the Schüfftan process , was chosen to render the visuals of the film . Schüfftan had worked with Franju on La Tête Contre les Murs ( 1958 ) . Film historian David Kalat called <unk> " the ideal choice to illustrate Franju 's nightmares " . ( Only two years later , <unk> won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography , Black @-@ and @-@ White for his work on The Hustler ( 1961 ) . ) French composer Maurice Jarre created the haunting score for the film . Jarre had also previously worked with Franju on his film La Tête Contre les Murs ( 1958 ) . Modern critics note the film 's two imposing musical themes , a jaunty carnival @-@ esque waltz ( featured while Louise picks up young women for Doctor Génessier ) and a lighter , sadder piece for Christiane . Jarre subsequently wrote the music score Lawrence of Arabia ( 1962 ) and Doctor Zhivago ( 1965 ) among other films .

 Eyes without a Face completed filming in 1959 , and had its debut in Paris on March 2 , 1960 . Although it passed through the European censors , the film caused controversy on its release in Europe . The French news magazine L 'Express noted the audience " dropped like flies " during the <unk> scene . During the film 's showing at the 1960 Edinburgh Film Festival , seven audience members fainted , to which director Franju responded , " Now I know why Scotsmen wear skirts . " 
 For the American release in 1962 , the film was cut . It was given an English @-@ language dub , and re @-@ titled The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus . Edits in the Dr. Faustus version removed parts of the <unk> scene as well as scenes showing Doctor Génessier 's more human side such his loving care for a small child at his clinic . The distributors recognized the artistic merit of the film and played up that element in promotion with an advertisement quoting the London Observer 's positive statements about the film and noting its showing at the Edinburgh Film Festival . This is in contrast to presentation of the secondary feature , The <unk> ( 1962 ) , which mainly focused on the <unk> @-@ show aspect with its " two @-@ headed monster " and " Invasion from outer space by two @-@ headed creature killer " . Eyes Without a Face had a very limited initial run and there was little reception from the American mainstream press . 
 Eyes Without a Face received its second large theatrical release in a September 1986 re @-@ release in conjunction with retrospectives at the National Film Theatre in London and at film archive Cinémathèque Française for its 50th anniversary in France . As a founder of Cinémathèque Française , the archive celebrated Franju by presenting the director 's back catalogue . The film was re @-@ released in its original form to American theatres on October 31 , 2003 under its original running time and title .

 Eyes Without a Face was released on VHS on January 9 , 2001 by Kino Video and on DVD on October 19 , 2004 by The Criterion Collection . The DVD also contains Georges Franju 's first documentary Blood of the Beasts ( 1949 ) , a depiction of a French slaughterhouse . A Region 2 release of Eyes Without a Face was released April 21 , 2008 by Second Sight Films . A Region 4 edition of the film was released on July 2 , 2007 by Umbrella Entertainment . The disc also included Franju 's documentary Blood of the Beasts . In 2013 , The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu @-@ ray , this time transferred directly from the camera negative . 
 = = Reception = = 
 On the film 's initial release , the French critics ' general response was moderate , ranging from mild enthusiasm to general disdain or disappointment , claiming it to be either a repetition of German expressionism or simply a disappointment of the director 's leap from documentary filmmaker to a genre filmmaker claiming the film to be in a " minor genre , quite unworthy of his abilities " . Franju responded to these comments claiming the film was his attempt to get the minor genre to be taken seriously . In England , Isabel Quigly , film critic for The Spectator , called it " the sickest film since I started film criticism " , while a reviewer who admitted that she liked the film was nearly fired . A review in Variety was negative , noting specifically that the " stilted acting , asides to explain characters and motivations , and a repetition of effects lose the initial impact " and an " unclear progression and plodding direction give [ the film ] an old @-@ fashioned air " . 
 With the September 1986 re @-@ release of the film , in conjunction with retrospectives at the National Film Theatre in London and at the Cinémathèque Française in France of the director 's back catalogue , the film 's critical status began to be re @-@ evaluated . French critics ' response to the film was much more positive than it was on its original release , with former editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Cahiers du cinéma Serge <unk> calling the film " a marvel " . The film was re @-@ released in its original form to American theatres on October 31 , 2003 and received great critical acclaim . Based on 35 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , Eyes Without a Face received an average 97 % fresh rating with an average rating of 8 @.@ 1 / 10 . The reviewers commented on the film 's poetic nature and noted the strong influence of French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau . Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader praised the film , referring to it as " absurd and as beautiful as a fairy tale " . J. Hoberman of The Village Voice declared the film " a masterpiece of poetic horror and tactful , tactile brutality " . The Encyclopedia of Horror Films noted the Cocteau influence , stating that " Franju invests [ the film ] with a weird poetry in which the influence of Cocteau is unmistakable " . David Edelstein of Slate also compared the film to Cocteau 's work , commenting that " the storyline is your standard obsessed @-@ mad @-@ doctor saga , one step above a Poverty Row Bela Lugosi feature ... [ b ] ut it 's Lugosi by way of Cocteau and Ionesco " . In the early 2010s , Time Out conducted a poll with several authors , directors , actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films . Eyes Without a Face placed at number 34 on their top 100 list .

 Long after the film 's original release , in February 2005 , the French soundtrack record label Play Time released the soundtrack on Compact Disc along with other soundtracks performed by Jarre . This also includes soundtracks from other Franju films including La Tête contre les Murs and Thérèse <unk> . 
 All music composed by Maurice Jarre .

 The film has influenced a handful of European films since its release . Spanish director Jesús Franco created films throughout his career that were influenced by the film . Franco 's first was the Spanish and French co @-@ production of <unk> en la noche ( 1962 ) . Franco 's variation of the film concerns the efforts of a mad surgeon , Dr. Orloff , to reconstruct the face of his disfigured daughter Melissa . Inspector Edgar Tanner investigates <unk> using his girlfriend , Wanda <unk> , as an undercover spy . Franco followed with several sequels to <unk> en la noche . He made one more film strongly influenced by the Franju film , Faceless ( 1988 ) . Faceless has a similar plot involving beautiful women who are abducted by Dr. <unk> 's ( Helmut Berger ) female assistant and kept hostage . The doctor uses the skin of the women to perform plastic surgery on his disfigured sister , but the experiments leave the victims mutilated and dead . The Italian film Atom Age Vampire ( 1961 ) was also influenced by Eyes Without a Face with a doctor attempting to take the faces of other women to repair his daughter 's face . These homages are seen in the plot line of a police lieutenant who is investigating the circumstances behind the death of a young girl whose body has scars around the eyes . The lieutenant 's investigation eventually leads him to a plastic surgery clinic , a similar plot motivation to Eyes Without a Face . The British film Corruption ( 1968 ) , starring Peter Cushing adds a variation to the theme : a surgeon tries to restore his fiancee 's beauty by repeatedly treating her with fluids extracted from the pituitary glands of murdered female victims . Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar has stated his 2011 film The Skin I Live In , which features a mad scientist who performs skin grafts and surgeries on an unwilling victim , was heavily influenced by Franju 's Eyes without a Face . 
 The film also influenced American film productions : John Carpenter has suggested that the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween . Carpenter recalls that the film crew " didn 't have any money to make a mask . It was originally written the way you see it , in other words , it 's a pale mask with human features , almost featureless . I don 't know why I wrote that down , why Debra [ Hill ] and I decided on that , maybe it was because of an old movie called Eyes Without a Face " . 
 DVD film reviews have suggested the film influenced director John Woo ; critics have compared the graphic detail of the face transplant scene in Woo 's action film Face / Off ( 1997 ) to the face transplant scene in Eyes Without a Face and noted the similarity . Another resemblance is Woo 's trademark use of white doves in his films that is similar to the character Christiane 's dove @-@ laden escape in the film 's finale . 
 In 2001 , on VH1 Storytellers , singer Billy Idol cited the film as giving him the idea for his song " Eyes Without a Face " . The song , which has the film 's original French title ( " Les <unk> Sans Visage " ) as the recurring background chorus , takes the father @-@ daughter relationship from the film and recasts it as the deteriorated relationship between the narrator and his lover . The song became Idol 's first top @-@ ten hit in the U.S.

 Dragon Quest ( Japanese : ドラゴンクエスト , Hepburn : Doragon Kuesuto ) , published as Dragon Warrior in North America until 2005 , is a series of internationally best @-@ selling console role @-@ playing video game ( RPG ) titles created by Yuji Horii and his studio , Armor Project . 
 The series is published by Square Enix ( formerly Enix ) , with localized versions of later installments for the Nintendo DS being published by Nintendo outside Japan . With its first title published in 1986 , there are currently ten main @-@ series titles , along with numerous spin @-@ off games . Nearly every game in the main series has either an anime or manga adaptation , or both . The series has had a significant impact on the development of console RPGs , and introduced a number of features to the genre . <unk> of the series have appeared on MSX computers , Nintendo Entertainment System , Super Nintendo Entertainment System , Game Boy Color , Game Boy Advance , Nintendo DS , PlayStation , PlayStation 2 and Wii video game consoles , and several models of mobile phones . Each Dragon Quest video game soundtrack is arranged into an orchestral piece and the video game series is the first to have live @-@ action ballet adaptations . 
 Early in the series the Dragon Quest games were released under the title Dragon Warrior in North America to avoid trademark conflict with the tabletop role @-@ playing game DragonQuest . Square Enix did not register the Dragon Quest trademark for use in the United States until 2002 . 
 The basic premise of most Dragon Quest titles is to play a hero who is out to save the land from peril at the hands of a powerful evil enemy , with the hero usually accompanied by a group of party members . Common elements persist throughout the series and its spinoff titles : turn @-@ based combat ; recurring monsters , including the Slime , which became the series ' mascot until the English version of Dragon Quest VIII : Journey of the Cursed King ; a text @-@ based menu system ; and random encounters ( in the main series ) , until Dragon Quest IX : Sentinels of the Starry Skies . The series is one of the few long @-@ running video game series to have a stable key development team ; scenario writer and game designer Yuji Horii , character designer Akira Toriyama and music composer Koichi Sugiyama have handled their respective roles from the beginning of the series . The original concepts , used since the first game , took elements from the western RPGs Wizardry and Ultima . A great deal of care was taken to make the gameplay intuitive so that players could easily start to play the game . The series features a number of religious overtones which were heavily censored in the Western NES versions . 
 Dragon Quest X is the most recent game in the main series . It is a massively multiplayer online game , featuring online battles . It has been released in Japan for the Wii , Wii U , Microsoft Windows , and Nintendo 3DS . Dragon Quest XI is currently in development , scheduled for a 2016 release on the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo 3DS . 
 = = Common elements = = 
 = = = Gameplay = = = 
 In most Dragon Quest games , players control a character or party of characters that can walk into towns and buy weapons , armor , and items to defeat monsters outside of the towns : on the world map or in a dungeon . However , in the original Dragon Quest , there was only one character walking on the map . In most of the games , battles occur through random monster attacks and improving the characters ' levels requires players to grind . The series uses cursed items , difficult dungeons where players need to use their resources wisely to complete them , and difficult boss battles . When the party encounters monsters the view switches perspective and players are presented with several options on a menu ; these first @-@ person menu @-@ based battles have become a staple of the series . Players use the menus to select weapons , magic , and other items used to attack and defeat the monsters , or can attempt to flee the fight ; though characters cannot flee during a boss battle . Once the party defeats the monsters by winning the battle , each party member gains experience points in order to reach new levels . When a character gains a new level , the statistics ( stats ) of the character are upgraded . Winning battles also rewards players with gold which can be used to purchase items . In addition to the experience points and gold awarded for successfully defeating monsters , occasionally , items will be dropped as well that are added to the player 's inventory . 
 In most Dragon Quest games , players must visit a church ( known as a House of Healing in the NES translations ) and talk to a priest or nun to save the games ' progress ; in Dragon Warrior , players had to talk to a king to save their progress , though the first two Dragon Quest titles for Famicom use a password save system . If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the hero is revived ; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive their party members . 
 Dragon Quest features " puff puff " – a Japanese onomatopoeia for a girl rubbing her breasts in someone 's face , which can also be used for the general term of a girl juggling her own breasts – massage girls that the player can hire with text describing their actions in the early games ; in later games gags were used since breasts could not be displayed . The text descriptions were removed from some North American translations . 
 In Dragon Warrior III , Dragon Quest VI : Realms of Revelation , Dragon Warrior VII , and Dragon Quest IX : Sentinels of the Starry Skies , several character classes can be chosen for the party members . Each game has its particular set of classes with typical options , including the Cleric , Fighter , Jester , Thief , Warrior , and Mage . All the aforementioned games also include advanced classes such as the Sage . In addition , Dragon Quest VI and VII include monster classes . 
 In Dragon Quest IV : Chapters of the Chosen , a new collectible item known as mini medals , resembling small gold coins with a five @-@ pointed star in the middle , was introduced ; they have nothing to do with winning the game , but they can be traded with a certain character for items . Players collect them throughout the game , primarily by opening chests , breaking pots and barrels , and searching in sacks and drawers . Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games , but did not want to repeat the necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game . 
 = = = Monsters = = = 
 The Dragon Quest series features several recurring monsters , including Slimes , <unk> , Skeletons , Shadows , Mummies , Trick Bags , and Dragons . Many monsters in the series were designed by Akira Toriyama . 
 Several Dragon Quest games allow the player to recruit monsters to fight alongside them . In Dragon Quest IV , a <unk> monster can be recruited for the first chapter . Dragon Quest V and VI monsters can be selected by the player to join the player 's party and fight in battles . In Dragon Quest VIII players can defeat and recruit monsters to fight in an arena . 
 The Slime , designed by Toriyama for use in Dragon Quest , has become the official mascot of the Dragon Quest series . Series designer Yuji Horii cited the monster as an example of Toriyama 's skills , claiming it took " [ artistic ] power to take something like a pool of slime and use his imagination to make it a great character . " A Slime is a small blue blob , shaped like a water droplet , with a face . It has appeared in every Dragon Quest game and it is usually one of the first monsters the players encounter . The Slime 's popularity has netted it the Slime spin @-@ off series on handheld consoles . 
 = = = Erdrick ( also known as Loto ) = = = 
 Erdrick , known as Loto ( <unk> , Roto ) in Japanese and in the North American remakes of the Game Boy Color version of the first three games , is the legendary hero from the Dragon Quest series . The first three Dragon Quest games , all connected to the legend of Erdrick , comprise the Erdrick or Loto trilogy . He is known in the game as the hero who freed the Kingdom of Alefgard from darkness . The chronological order of the first three Dragon Quest games is : Dragon Quest III , Dragon Quest , and Dragon Quest II . 
 In the first Dragon Quest game , the hero , the player @-@ character , is a descendant of Erdrick who follows in his footsteps to reach the Dragonlord 's Castle and confront him . In Dragon Quest II the heroes are also descendants of Erdrick , exploring the expanded world of <unk> that includes the continent of Alefgard . Erdrick 's legend in the Dragon Quest series was completed in Dragon Quest III when the King of Alefgard bestows the " Order of Erdrick " , the country 's highest honor , upon the hero at the end of the game . Two of the player @-@ character 's three highest @-@ level armaments are named " Erdrick 's Sword " and " Erdrick 's Armor " in Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II . Playing Dragon Quest III with the name " Erdrick " is impossible in the original release , as the game prompts the player to choose a different name for the hero . The reason for this is that the status of III in the chronological order as a prequel of the first two titles is presented as a plot twist . The Game Boy Color remakes prevent the use of the name " Loto " for the same reason . 
 = = = Zenithia = = = 
 Zenithia , also called Zenith Castle , Zenith , or Tenkū @-@ jō ( <unk> , " Heaven Castle " ) in Japanese , is a floating castle that first appears in Dragon Quest IV ; it is used as a descriptor for several elements in Dragon Quest IV , V and VI . Its appearance in all three games has led to the games being described as the Zenithia or Tenkū trilogy , despite different geographical layouts in each of the three games ' worlds . Horii explained that a trilogy was never the intention : " Each Dragon Quest title represents a fresh start and a new story , so it seems too much of a connection between the games in the series . It could be said that the imagination of players has brought the titles together in a certain fashion . " 
 In Dragon Quest IV Zenithia can be accessed by climbing the tower above the entrance to the world of darkness . In Dragon Quest V Zenithia has fallen into a lake south of Lofty Peak ( <unk> in the original release ) , until the Golden Orb is returned leaving the castle able to move freely in the sky . In Dragon Quest VI Zenithia is sealed by Demon Lord Dhuran , and a large hole is left in its place in the " Dream World " . When the Dream World returns to its natural state in Dragon Quest VI , Zenithia is the only part that remains , floating above the " real " world . In addition to the trilogy , a castle in the Dragon Quest III remakes is also called Zenith , although the layout differs from the castle in the Tenkū series .

 = = = Spinoffs = = = 
 The franchise includes several spin @-@ off games , including the Dragon Quest Monsters RPG . The series has also inspired arcade games such as the Japanese Dragon Quest : Monster Battle Road , where players compete for real @-@ life cards with monster data that the arcade game issues to the players through a slot on its front . The latter is the only spin @-@ off series to have none of its titles released outside Japan . The Mystery Dungeon and Fortune Street series use characters and other elements from Dragon Quest games , and the Mystery Dungeon series has gone on to spawn its own franchise . 
 In 1993 Chunsoft developed a SNES game that included Torneko ( a.k.a. Torneko <unk> ) , a character that first appeared in Dragon Quest IV . The roguelike game Torneko no Daibōken : Fushigi no Dungeon continues Torneko 's story from Dragon Quest IV as he attempts to make his store famous , venturing into mysterious dungeons to retrieve items to stock his store with . The game was successful in Japan . In 2000 the direct sequel Torneko : The Last Hope was released in Japan and the United States . The gameplay is similar to the first game , though Torneko : The Last Hope is considered easier to play . The game sold enough copies in Japan to allow development of the second direct sequel on the PlayStation 2 titled Fushigi no Dungeon 3 Torneko no Daibouken ( <unk> <unk> ? , lit . " Mystery Dungeon 3 : <unk> 's Adventure " ) . The second and third Torneko games have had remakes for the Game Boy Advance ( GBA ) . A later game featured Yangus , a character who first appeared in Dragon Quest VIII ; Dragon Quest : Shōnen Yangus to Fushigi no Dungeon follows Yangus on his adventures before he meets up with Hero in afore mentioned game . The success of Torneko no Daibōken spawned the Mystery Dungeon series that has grown to include franchises beyond Dragon Quest , as well as other clones . 
 When Enix took over the Monopoly @-@ inspired video game Itadaki Street , the Dragon Quest franchise became an integral part of the game in its second version , Itadaki Street 2 : Neon Sain wa Bara Iro ni ( <unk> <unk> , lit . Summit Street 2 : Rose @-@ Colored Neon Sign ) . The first Itadaki Street , released by ASCII , did not contain elements from the Dragon Quest franchise . The fourth game in the series , Dragon Quest & Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Special ( ドラゴンクエスト ＆ ファイナルファンタジー in <unk> Special ) , included characters from the Final Fantasy franchise , and later versions would include characters from Mario . 
 Like the main series , Dragon Quest Monsters was originally released under the Dragon Warrior name in the US . The next game , Dragon Warrior Monsters 2 , is the only game to be split into two versions , Cobi 's Journey ( Ruka 's Journey in Japan ) <unk> 's Adventure ( Iru 's Adventure in Japan ) , named after the main player characters . Each version has slight differences , such as the monster that appear in them . Dragon Quest Monsters : Caravan Heart is a prequel to Dragon Warrior VII , following Keifer who is pulled into <unk> and must find the six Orbs of Loto in order to return . The release of Dragon Quest Monsters : Joker is the first spin @-@ off title to be released in English using the Dragon Quest name ; its sequel Dragon Quest Monsters : Joker 2 was released in North America in September 19 , 2011 . There is also an Android title , Dragon Quest Monsters : Wanted ! ( ドラゴンクエスト <unk> Wanted ！ ) . 
 Dragon Quest has also produced a number of smaller spin @-@ off titles . In two of them players use their special controllers as a sword , swinging it to slash enemies and objects . Kenshin Dragon Quest : <unk> Densetsu no Ken is a stand @-@ alone game in which the controller is shaped like a sword , and a toy shield contains the game 's hardware . Dragon Quest Swords for the Wii uses the motion sensing Wii Remote as a sword . Another spin @-@ off title , Slime <unk> Dragon Quest , uses the game 's popular slime monster as the protagonist , and its sequel , Dragon Quest Heroes : Rocket Slime , has been translated into English . There is also a downloadable DSiWare turn @-@ based strategy game , Dragon Quest Wars and other titles have been released in Japan for cellphones . Dragon Quest Heroes : The World Tree 's Woe and the Blight Below , a PlayStation 3 and 4 game featuring the gameplay of the Dynasty Warriors series by Koei Tecmo , was released in Japan on February 26 , 2015 , and was released in North America and Europe in October 2015 as a PlayStation 4 exclusive .

 There are two major television series that were adapted from the games . 
 Dragon Quest began airing in December 1989 , and ran for 43 episodes . It was supervised by Horii , with a story loosely based on Dragon Quest III . The first 13 episodes of the series were translated into English by Saban Entertainment under the title Dragon Warrior .

 = = = History = = = 
 In 1982 Enix sponsored a video game programming contest in Japan which brought much of the Dragon Quest team together , including creator Yuji Horii . The prize was a trip to the United States and a visit to <unk> ' 83 in San Francisco , where Horii discovered the Wizardry video game series . The contest winners Koichi Nakamura and Yukinobu Chida , together with Horii , released the Enix NES game The Portopia Serial Murder Case . Music composer Sugiyama , known for composing jingles and pop songs , was impressed with the group 's work and sent a postcard to Enix praising the software . Enix asked him to compose music for some of its games . The group then decided to make a role @-@ playing video game that combined elements from the western RPGs Wizardry and Ultima . Horii wanted to introduce the concept of RPGs to the wider Japanese video game audience . He chose the Famicom because , unlike arcade games , players would not have to worry about spending more money if they got a " game over " , and could continue playing from a save point . Horii used the full @-@ screen map of Ultima and the battle and statistics @-@ oriented Wizardry screens to create the gameplay of Dragon Quest . Dragon Ball creator and manga artist Akira Toriyama , who knew of Horii through the manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump , was commissioned to illustrate the characters and monsters to separate the game from other role @-@ playing games of the time . The primary game designs were conceived by Horii before being handed to Toriyama to re @-@ draw under Horii 's supervision . When Horii first created Dragon Quest many people doubted that a fantasy series with swords and dungeons , instead of science fiction elements , would become popular in Japan ; however , the series has become very popular there . Since then Horii has been the games ' scenario director . Dragon Quest was Sugiyama 's second video game he had composed for , Wingman 2 being his first . He says it took him five minutes to compose the original opening theme . His musical motifs from the first game have remained relatively intact . 
 The first six Dragon Quest stories are divided into two trilogies . The first three games of the series tell the story of the legendary hero known as Roto ( Erdrick or Loto in some versions ) . Dragon Quest IV @-@ VI are based around a castle in the sky called Zenithia , referred to as the <unk> in Japan , meaning " heaven " . Games in the main series from Dragon Quest VII onwards are stand @-@ alone games . 
 The early Dragon Quest games were released under the title Dragon Warrior in North America to avoid trademark conflict with the pen @-@ and @-@ paper role @-@ playing game Dragon Quest , which was published by Simulations Publications in the 1980s until the company 's 1982 bankruptcy and acquisition by TSR , Inc .. TSR continued publishing the line as an alternative to Dungeons & Dragons ( D & D ) until 1987 . On July 23 , 2002 , Square Enix registered the Dragon Quest trademark in the United States for use with manuals , video cassette tapes , and other video game software . On October 8 , 2003 , Square Enix filed for a more comprehensive Dragon Quest trademark . Dragon Quest VIII : Journey of the Cursed King became the first Dragon Quest game released outside Japan , all previous games having used the Dragon Warrior title . 
 Dragon Quest was not as successful outside Japan , as it was eclipsed by another RPG series , Final Fantasy . Because of Enix 's closure in the mid @-@ 1990s , Dragon Quest V and Dragon Quest VI were not officially released in North America . No games were released in Europe prior to the spin @-@ off Dragon Quest Monsters . With the merger of Square and Enix in 2003 , Dragon Quest games were released in numerous markets . In May 2008 Square Enix announced localizations of the Nintendo DS remakes of Dragon Quest IV , V , and VI for North America and the PAL region , commonly referred to as the " Zenithia " or " <unk> trilogy " . With this announcement , all the main Dragon Quest games have been released outside Japan . The ninth instalment was released in Japan for Nintendo DS on July 11 , 2009 . The North American version was released on July 11 , 2010 , while the European version came out on July 23 , 2010 . The tenth instalment of the main series is currently in development for the Wii . Nintendo has been a major publisher outside Japan for the main Dragon Quest games , publishing the first Dragon Quest game in North America , and recently publishing Dragon Quest IX worldwide outside Japan ; the NDS version of Dragon Quest VI is published by Nintendo in North America . 
 = = = Creation and design = = = 
 When designing Dragon Quest , Horii play @-@ tests the games to make certain the controls feel right . This includes going into meticulous details such as how fast a page opens or the way a door opens . According to Horii , " ... little things like here and there the controls not feeling right and such can really grate the players ' nerves if the tempo isn 't right . " He believes players should be able to control the game unconsciously , which is not easy to accomplish . Horii tries to design the games in such a way that players never need to read a manual nor play through a tutorial in order to figure out how to play the game , and tries to create good storylines with short dialogues . Ryutaro Ichimura , who has worked on Dragon Quest titles with Horii since Dragon Quest VIII , has implemented Horii 's suggestions even when it is not obvious why his ideas will work . " [ A ] lot of the time when he [ Horii ] points these things out , we cannot see them at first , but eventually you get it . " 
 Dragon Quest games have an overall upbeat feeling . The typical Dragon Quest plot involves the player controlling a party of heroes to defeat an ultimate evil villain , who usually threatens the world in some way . The plot @-@ line often consists of smaller stories that involve encounters with other characters . This linear plot @-@ line is intentional , to help ease the generally high learning curve RPGs have for those unaccustomed to them . The gameplay is designed to allow players to decide when , and whether , to pursue certain storyline paths . To ensure players continue to enjoy playing the game , no storyline path is made without some kind of reward and , to help ease players who may be apprehensive about whether they are on the right path , the distance the character has to travel to get rewarded is reduced at the beginning of the game . While the player never starts the game in a wholly non @-@ linear way , they usually allow players to explore an open world in a non @-@ linear manner following an early linear section of the game . Early character levels start players off with more hit points and a substantially increasing growth at later levels , although the effective bonuses of every additional level decreases . 
 While Toriyama would later become more widely known with the success of Dragon Ball Z in North America , when Dragon Quest was released he was an unknown outside Japan . While the Dragon Quest 's hero was drawn in a super deformed manga style , the Dragon Warrior localization had him drawn in the " West 's template of a medieval hero " . The trend continued through the first four games , although the artwork for weapons and armor began using more of Toriyama 's original artwork for Dragon Warrior III and IV . However , while the <unk> ' artwork was altered , the setting and poses remained virtually identical . 
 The games always feature a number of religious overtones ; after the first Dragon Warrior game saving , and reviving characters who have died , is performed by clergy in churches . Bishops wander around the over @-@ world of Dragon Quest Monsters and can heal wounded characters . The final enemy in some of the Dragon Quest games is called the Demon Lord ; for instance in Dragon Quest VII , the Demon Lord ( known as <unk> in that particular game ) is the final boss , and there is a sidequest to battle against God . The first four Dragon Quest titles were subjected to censorship in their North American localizations , largely in keeping with Nintendo of America 's content guidelines at the time that placed severe restrictions on religious iconography and mature content . When these games were remade for the Game Boy Color , most censorship was removed . The translated versions of the games have largely followed the originals since Dragon Quest VII . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The Dragon Quest soundtracks were composed and arranged by Koichi Sugiyama . Sugiyama , already a well @-@ known television composer , sent a feedback questionnaire from an Enix game to the company , and , upon seeing Sugiyama 's feedback , Fukushima contacted him to confirm that " he was the Sugiyama from television . " Upon confirmation , Fukushima asked Sugiyama to compose a score for Dragon Quest . Sugiyama had previously composed a video game score for Wingman 2 . Sugiyama has said it took him five minutes to compose the original opening theme , and noted the difficulty in adding a personal touch to the short jingles , but that his past experience with creating music for television commercials helped . According to Sugiyama , the composer has between three and five seconds to catch the audience 's attention through music . The theme and his other jingles for Dragon Quest have remained relatively intact in its sequels . 
 The first album of music from the series was released in 1986 and was based on music from the first game , followed by a Symphonic Suite album for each game in the main series . The original soundtrack 's " eight melodies " approach set the template for most RPG soundtracks released since then , hundreds of which have been organized in a similar manner . The original game 's classical score was considered revolutionary for video game music . 
 Other compilations of Dragon Quest music have been released , including Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol . 1 . The London Philharmonic performed many of the soundtracks , including a compilation entitled Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Complete CD @-@ Box . Some of the soundtracks include a second disc with the original game music , as with the Dragon Quest VI soundtrack . In 2003 SME Visual Works released Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Complete CD @-@ Box , featuring music from the first seven Dragon Quest games . 
 = = Cultural impact = = 
 Dragon Quest has become a cultural phenomenon in Japan . According to Ryutaro Ichimura and Yuji Horii , Dragon Quest has become popular enough that it is used as a common topic for conversation in Japan , and is considered by the Japanese gaming industry as Japan 's national game . William Cassidy of GameSpy claims that " the common wisdom is that if you ask someone from Japan to draw ' Slime , ' he 'll draw the onion @-@ like shape of the weak enemies from the game . " With the Japanese release of Dragon Quest IX in January 2009 , a new eatery inspired by the series called <unk> 's Bar was opened in Roppongi , a well @-@ known nightlife hotspot in Minato , Tokyo . This was notable due to the usual center of Tokyo 's gaming culture being Akihabara rather than Roppongi . The venue provides a meeting location for fans of the series : styled in the fashion of a Medieval public house like its virtual counterpart , its food is directly inspired by both items and monsters found in the games . It was described by a Western journalist as a cross between a Disneyland resort and a maid café Dragon Quest also served as the inspiration for a live @-@ action television drama . Yūsha Yoshihiko initially aired in July 2011 , with a sequel series being produced and released the following year . For its 2012 April Fool 's Hoax , Google announced a " NES version " of its Google Maps service , which uses graphics and music licensed from Dragon Quest . 
 There is an urban myth that the release of Dragon Quest III caused a law to be passed in Japan banning the sale of Dragon Quest games or video games in general except on certain days such as weekends or national holidays . When III was released in Japan , over 300 schoolchildren were arrested for truancy while waiting in stores for the game to be released . The rumor claims there was a measurable dip in productivity when a Dragon Quest game was released and although muggings of Dragon Quest titles became so widespread there were hearings in the Japanese Diet , no law was ever passed . However , the Japanese release of every Dragon Quest title continued to be on a Saturday until the release of Dragon Quest X , which was released on Thursday , August 2 , 2012 . Nevertheless , each new Dragon Quest launch is widely anticipated . 
 Dragon Quest 's music has been influential on various sectors of the performing arts . It is the first video game series to receive live @-@ action ballet adaptations , and musical concerts and audio CDs were produced based on the Dragon Quest universe . Since 1987 the series ' music is performed annually in concert halls throughout Japan . Early Dragon Quest concerts inspired Nobuo Uematsu 's Final Fantasy compositions . 
 = = Legacy and reception = = 
 As of June 2014 , the Dragon Quest series has sold over 64 million units worldwide and is one of the most popular video game series in Japan . All games in the main series , and its many spin @-@ offs , have sold over a million copies in Japan and some games have sold over four million copies . The remake of Dragon Quest VI sold 0 @.@ 91 million copies in Japan in the first four days after its release , an exceptional sales figure for a remake . In 2006 readers of the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu voted on the hundred best video games of all time . Dragon Quest III was third , Dragon Quest VIII fourth , Dragon Quest VII ninth , Dragon Quest V eleventh , Dragon Quest IV fourteenth , Dragon Quest II seventeenth , Dragon Quest thirtieth , and Dragon Quest VI thirty @-@ fourth . In 2009 Horii received a special award at the Computer Entertainment Supplier 's Association Developers Conference for his work on the Dragon Quest franchise . 
 According to Satoru Iwata , former President of Nintendo , Dragon Quest 's widespread appeal is that it is " made so that anyone can play it ... and anyone can enjoy it depending on their different levels and interests . " According to him , Dragon Quest is designed for anyone to pick up without needing to read the manual in order to understand it . Ryutaro Ichimura , producer at Square Enix , who has played the game since he was a child , says the Dragon Quest storylines allow players to experience a moving sense of achievement where they take the role of a hero saving the world . Horii believes the ability to appeal to larger audiences of casual gamers , while not alienating the more hardcore gamers , is due to being able to lower the initial hurdle without making it too easy . Iwata and Ichimura believe it is because the games are created in a way that allows both groups to pursue their own goals ; casual gamers can enjoy the storyline and battles , but for those who want more there is still content for them to pursue . 
 Although the series is extremely popular in Japan , by 2002 the success in Japan had not transferred to North America . Although the first four games to be released in America generally received good reviews , Nintendo had to give away copies of Dragon Warrior . However , those four games have been among the most sought @-@ after titles for the NES , especially Dragon Warrior III and IV . It was not until Dragon Warrior VII was released that Dragon Quest became critically acclaimed in North America , although reception was still mixed . The series gained more universal praise with Dragon Quest VIII , and began to sell better outside Japan and Dragon Quest IX sold over 1 million copies outside Japan . 
 The original Dragon Quest game is often cited as the first console RPG . GameSpot called the original Dragon Quest one of the fifteen most influential games of all time and the " most influential role @-@ playing games of all time " , stating that nearly all Japanese RPGs since then have drawn from its gameplay " in some shape or form . " In response to a survey , Gamasutra cites Quinton <unk> of Dartmouth College as stating Dragon Warrior translated the D & D experience to video games and set the genre standards . Games such as Mother , Breath of Fire and <unk> & the Fortress of Doom were inspired by various Dragon Quest titles . Dragon Quest III 's class @-@ changing system would shape other RPGs , especially the Final Fantasy series . Early games in the series are also credited with affecting D & D 's leveling system to even out its randomness by giving more bonuses early on and giving starting characters maximum hit points at their initial level . Dragon Quest IV 's " Tactics " system , where the player can set the AI routines for NPCs , is seen as a precursor to Final Fantasy XII 's " Gambits " system . Dragon Quest V is cited as having monster recruiting and training mechanics that inspired monster @-@ collecting RPGs such as Pokémon , Digimon , and <unk> , and in turn the modern trend of collecting achievements . Dragon Quest V also introduced the concept of a playable pregnancy . The real world and dream world setting of Dragon Quest VI is considered an influence on the later Square RPGs Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy X. The Dragon Quest series was recognized by Guinness World Records , with six world records in the Guinness World Records Gamer 's Edition . These records include " Best Selling Role Playing Game on the Super Famicom " , " Fastest Selling Game in Japan " , and " First Video Game Series to Inspire a Ballet " . 
 One of the main aspects of the series that critics point out , either positively or negatively , is that the series " never strays from its classic roots . " Unlike other modern , complex RPGs , Dragon Quest on the DS retains the simple gameplay from the first game that many critics find refreshing and nostalgic . Points of contention are its battle system , comparatively simplistic storylines , general lack of character development , simplistic primitive @-@ looking graphics ( in earlier titles ) , and the overall difficulty of the game . These arguments are countered by noting its strength in episodic storytelling with the various non @-@ player characters the party meets . The stories avoid melodrama and feature relatively more simplistic characters than Final Fantasy 's Squall Leonhart or Tidus , a source of contention . There are exceptions , however , such as Dragon Quest V , which has been praised for its unique , emotional storytelling . Battles are also simple and finish quickly . As for difficulty , Yuji Horii is noted as a gambler . The lack of save points and the general difficulty of the battles were included with the intention of adding a sense of tension . Because of this added difficulty , the punishment for the party 's death was toned down compared to other games by simply going back to where you had last saved , with half of your gold on hand . When asked about criticism of Dragon Quest games , Horii says he does not mind , it means the critics played the game and he would rather know their concerns than remain ignorant . 
 = SMS Braunschweig = 
 SMS Braunschweig was the first of five pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the Braunschweig class in the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) . She was laid down in 1901 and commissioned in October 1904 , at a cost of 23 @,@ 983 @,@ 000 marks . She was named after the then Duchy of Brunswick ( German : Braunschweig ) . Her sister ships were Elsass , Hessen , Preussen , and Lothringen . 
 The ship served in the II Squadron of the German fleet after commissioning , though by the outbreak of World War I she had been moved to the IV Squadron . Braunschweig saw action in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy . In August 1915 , the ship participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga , during which she engaged the Russian battleship Slava . In 1916 , the ship was placed in reserve owing to crew shortages . She spent the remainder of World War I as a training ship , and after 1917 , as a barracks ship for U @-@ boat crews . 
 Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , she was retained after the end of the war and modernized in 1921 – 22 . Braunschweig served in the reformed Reichsmarine as a coastal defense ship until 1926 , when she was again placed in reserve . She was stricken in 1931 and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Braunschweig was laid down in 1901 , at the Germaniawerft in Kiel under construction number 97 . The first of her class , she was ordered under the contract name " H " as a new unit for the fleet . The ship cost 23 @,@ 983 @,@ 000 marks . Braunschweig was launched on 20 December 1902 and commissioned into the fleet on 15 October 1904 . 
 The ship was 127 @.@ 70 m ( 419 ft 0 in ) long overall and had a beam of 22 @.@ 20 m ( 72 ft 10 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 10 m ( 26 ft 7 in ) forward . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws . Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical boilers , all of which burned coal . Braunschweig 's powerplant was rated at 16 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 000 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 Braunschweig 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 28 cm ( 11 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 17 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 inch ) SK L / 40 guns and eighteen 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 35 quick @-@ firing guns . The armament suite was rounded out with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , all mounted submerged in the hull . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Upon commissioning in October 1904 , Braunschweig was assigned to the II Division of the II Squadron of the German fleet . She was joined by her sister Elsass the following month ; the II Division was rounded out by the old battleship Weissenburg . The German Navy in 1905 consisted of four divisions of three battleships each , with two divisions per squadron . This was supported by a cruiser division , composed of two armored cruisers and six protected cruisers . 
 After the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Braunschweig was assigned to the IV Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet . The squadron was commanded by Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt . In July 1915 , following the loss of the minelaying cruiser SMS Albatross in the Baltic , the IV Squadron ships were transferred to reinforce the German naval forces in the area . On 11 and 19 July , German cruisers , with the IV Squadron ships in support , conducted sweeps in the Baltic , though without engaging Russian forces . 
 In August 1915 , the German fleet attempted to clear the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces , in order to aid the German Army advancing on the city . The IV Squadron was joined by the I Squadron , which consisted of the eight Nassau and Helgoland @-@ class battleships , from the High Seas Fleet , along with three battlecruisers and a host of smaller craft . The task force was placed under command of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper , though operational command remained with Vice Admiral Schmidt . On the morning of 8 August , the Germans made their initial push into the Gulf ; Braunschweig and Elsass were tasked with engaging the Russian pre @-@ dreadnought Slava and preventing her from disrupting the German minesweepers . However , when it became clear that the minesweepers could not clear the minefield before nightfall , Schmidt called off the attempt . A second attempt was made on 16 August ; this time , Braunschweig remained outside the Gulf while the dreadnoughts Nassau and Posen took over the task of dealing with Slava . By 19 August , the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf . Reports of Allied submarines in the area , however , prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day . 
 On 12 October , the British submarine E18 fired a single torpedo at Braunschweig , though it failed to hit its target . Due to manpower shortages , the IV Squadron ships were demobilized . In 1916 , Braunschweig became a training ship . On 20 August 1917 , she was transferred for use as a barracks ship stationed in Kiel . In this role , the ship supported the III Submarine Flotilla . 
 The Treaty of Versailles , which ended the war , specified that Germany was permitted to retain six battleships of the " Deutschland or Lothringen types . " Braunschweig was chosen to remain on active service with the newly reformed Reichsmarine . The ship was modernized at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven from 1921 – 22 . In 1923 , Braunschweig 's bridge was rebuilt and enlarged . She and Elsass , along with the Deutschland @-@ class battleship Schlesien , were assigned to the North Sea Station . The ship served with the fleet until 1926 , when she was withdrawn from active duty and placed in reserve . On 31 March 1931 , Braunschweig was stricken from the naval register and temporarily used as a hulk in Wilhelmshaven before being broken up for scrap . 
 = 2003 FA Community Shield = 
 The 2003 FA Community Shield was the 81st FA Community Shield , an annual English football match played between the winners of the previous season 's Premier League and FA Cup competitions . It was held at Cardiff 's Millennium Stadium , on 10 August 2003 . The match was played between Manchester United , champions of the 2002 – 03 Premier League and Arsenal , who beat Southampton 1 – 0 in the 2003 FA Cup Final . Manchester United won the Shield 4 – 3 on penalties , after the match finished 1 – 1 after 90 minutes . 
 This was Manchester United 's 22nd Community Shield appearance and Arsenal 's 17th . Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson assessed before the match that his midfield was stronger than before , despite selling first @-@ team players David Beckham and Juan Sebastián Verón . Arsène Wenger was optimistic of Arsenal 's prospects in the upcoming season despite having only made minor changes to his squad , and Chelsea 's emergence as a competitor following Roman Abramovich 's takeover . Having been linked with a transfer away during the summer , Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira revealed before the game his intention to stay at the club . 
 Goalkeepers Tim Howard and Jens Lehmann made their competitive debuts for their respective clubs in the match . Ole Gunnar Solskjær started in midfield for Manchester United , with Paul Scholes playing behind the main striker , Ruud van Nistelrooy . For Arsenal , Kolo Touré partnered Sol Campbell in central defence as Martin Keown was absent . Mikaël Silvestre gave Manchester United the lead in the 15th minute from a corner , but Thierry Henry equalised for Arsenal five minutes later from a free @-@ kick . In the second half , substitute Francis Jeffers was sent off for kicking out at Phil Neville . Neither team was able to score in the remaining time , so the match was decided by a penalty shoot @-@ out . Howard saved the decisive spot @-@ kick taken by Robert Pirès . 
 Both managers were pleased with their teams ' performances , in particular Ferguson , who felt his players coped well in the heat . The 2003 Community Shield brought its lowest crowd since 1995 ; Wenger reasoned there was " less and less appetite " for the event . 
 = = Background = = 
 Founded in 1908 as a successor to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield , the FA Community Shield began as a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League , although in 1913 , it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI . In 1921 , it was played by the league champions of the top division and FA Cup winners for the first time . Wembley Stadium acted as the host of the Shield from 1974 . Cardiff 's Millennium Stadium was hosting the Shield for the third time ; it took over as the venue for the event while Wembley Stadium underwent a six @-@ year renovation between 2001 and 2006 . 
 Manchester United qualified for the 2003 FA Community Shield by winning the Premier League – their eighth championship in 11 years . Despite making their worst start to a league campaign since the 1989 – 90 season , the team finished five points clear of second @-@ placed Arsenal , the pre @-@ season favourites . Arsenal 's campaign was compensated by an appearance in the 2003 FA Cup Final ; the team beat Southampton 1 – 0 to retain the trophy and qualify for the Community Shield . 
 Manchester United were appearing in the Community Shield for the 22nd time , having won 10 outright ( 1908 , 1911 , 1952 , 1956 , 1957 , 1983 , 1993 , 1994 , 1996 , 1997 ) , sharing four ( 1965 , 1967 , 1977 , 1990 ) and losing seven ( 1948 , 1963 , 1985 , 1998 , 1999 , 2000 , 2001 ) . In contrast , Arsenal appeared in 16 previous Shields , likewise winning 10 outright ( 1930 , 1931 , 1933 , 1934 , 1938 , 1948 , 1953 , 1998 , 1999 , 2002 ) , while sharing one ( 1991 ) and losing five ( 1935 , 1936 , 1979 , 1989 , 1993 ) . This was the fifth meeting between the two clubs in the Community Shield ; Arsenal won three of those meetings to Manchester United 's one .

 Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said before the Community Shield that new signings Eric Djemba @-@ Djemba and <unk> had made his midfield stronger , in spite of selling first @-@ team players David Beckham and Juan Sebastián Verón : " The two of them give us youth in that department and I think it 's important to have young legs in there , particularly with the amount of games we play . " 
 Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira revealed his intention to stay at the club , despite interest from Chelsea , who had been acquired by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in the summer . Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team 's chances were as good , if not better than Chelsea 's : " I can understand that we look a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and you will see that we look good . To write us off just because we haven 't spent £ 100 million is a bit easy . " 
 Neither United nor Arsenal made noticeable changes to their squad , but Ferguson believed both teams would remain the ones to beat in the Premier League : " There 's only really ourselves and Arsenal who know what it takes to win the Premiership . It 's not an easy thing to achieve . You need experience . "

 The stadium observed a minute 's silence in memory of Ray Harford and Manchester United reserve player Jimmy Davis , who both died on 9 August 2003 . Arsenal kicked off the match and within the first two minutes Phil Neville and Ashley Cole were booked for mistimed tackles . The match settled into " a more sedate rhythm " soon after , and in the 13th minute , Scholes ' long pass found Solskjær , who was subsequently tackled ; the ball ran out for a corner . It was delivered by Ryan Giggs and the ball was flicked on by Roy Keane at the near post – an unmarked Mikaël Silvestre headed it into the net , which gave United the lead . It was short @-@ lived , however ; in the 18th minute , Nicky Butt conceded a free @-@ kick for a foul on Vieira . From " about 33 yards out " , Henry shot the ball past United 's wall and beat Howard in goal . Arsenal 's equaliser did not hand them the impetus , for United continued to control proceedings . Silvestre 's cross in the 28th minute fashioned a chance for Giggs , though Arsenal 's defence prevented him from getting a shot . Giggs came close to scoring five minutes later ; a cross by Butt found the Welshman whose effort hit the post . United finished the half with two half @-@ chances . 
 Ray Parlour and Henry came off in the second half for Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord . United created an early chance , but Van Nistelrooy was unable to make the most of Giggs ' delivery . The player went down in the penalty area under the challenge of Campbell , prompting United players to appeal for a penalty ; however , referee Steve Bennett decided to let play continue . Arsenal countered twice thereafter , but their attacks broke down on both counts . Vieira , Scholes and Quinton Fortune were booked for tackles during a 10 @-@ minute spell . Both clubs made substitutions in the midway point of the second half : for Arsenal , Bergkamp , Gilberto and Ljungberg were replaced by Francis Jeffers , Edu and Giovanni van Bronckhorst , whereas for United , Butt and Fortune came off for Eric Djemba @-@ Djemba and John O 'Shea . In the 72nd minute , Jeffers was shown a red card for kicking out at Neville . Ferguson brought on striker Diego Forlán for Neville six minutes later . Djemba @-@ Djemba avoided a yellow card for his challenge on Campbell in the 80th minute ; Bennett deemed it unintentional . 
 The game descended into a scrappy affair in the last few minutes , with few clear cut chances for either side . With no further goals , it was decided by penalties . Scholes , Edu and Ferdinand converted their kicks , before Howard saved Van <unk> 's effort . Van Nistelrooy missed his and Wiltord scored to level the tally at 2 – 2 in the shoot @-@ out . Solskjær , Lauren and Forlán scored , but Pirès missed – his effort saved by Howard – which won United the Shield , 4 – 3 on penalties .

 Henry Winter of The Daily Telegraph opined that , injuries to players aside , " The Community Shield itself experienced most damage " . Arsenal returned 8 @,@ 000 of their ticket allocation , while transport problems meant spectators were unable to reach Cardiff in time . A crowd of 59 @,@ 923 was the Shield 's lowest in eight years . 
 Ferguson was delighted in how his team coped with the pitchside temperatures : " You had to be down there to appreciate it . I was told it was 41 degrees on the pitch – I know I was roasting just watching them . " When asked about Howard 's positioning for Arsenal 's equaliser , he replied : " Tim wanted three in the wall and he will learn from that . This isn 't America . " Silvestre denied suggestions that the win gave United a psychological edge over Arsenal : " This is still a pre @-@ season game . We won the Premiership title with a strong run at the end of last season . " Howard was unsure whether he would displace Barthez in the first team for a prolonged run – " that 's not my decision " , though continued " We have four great goalkeepers and we 're looking to have a good battle all season long . " 
 Wenger was content with his team 's performance : " We are at only 80 % fitness and still we got a draw with Manchester United , " and thought his defence stood firm against United 's attack . He felt Jeffers ' dismissal was " deserved " for overreacting , but added , " He 's apologised . He realised he made a mistake . He 's intelligent , he 's young and he 'll learn . " The performance of Lehmann encouraged the Arsenal manager ; he noted that the goalkeeper was " amazed to see the referee wave play on after one aerial challenge . " Wenger made reference to Arsenal 's low crowd turnout and suggested it meant there was " less and less appetite " for the Shield .

 Howard William Morenz ( September 21 , 1902 – March 8 , 1937 ) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player . He played centre for three National Hockey League ( NHL ) teams : the Montreal Canadiens ( in two stints ) , the Chicago Black Hawks , and the New York Rangers . Before joining the NHL , Morenz excelled in the junior Ontario Hockey Association , where his team played for the Memorial Cup , the championship for junior ice hockey in Canada . In the NHL , he was one of the most dominant players in the league and set several league scoring records . A strong skater , Morenz was referred to as the " Stratford Streak " and " Mitchell Meteor " in reference to his speed on the ice . 
 Considered one of the first stars of the NHL , Morenz played 14 seasons in the league . He was a member of a Stanley Cup – winning team three times , all with the Canadiens . During his NHL career he placed in the top 10 leading scorers ten times . For seven straight seasons , Morenz led the Canadiens in both goals scored and points . Three times in his career he was named the most valuable player of the league , and he led the league once in goals scored and twice in points scored . He was named to the NHL All @-@ Star Team three times . 
 Morenz died from complications of a broken leg , an injury he suffered in a game . After his death , the Canadiens retired his jersey number , the first time the team had done so for any player . When the Hockey Hall of Fame opened in 1945 , Morenz was one of the original nine inductees . In 1950 , the Canadian Press named him the best ice hockey player of the first half of the 20th century .

 Born in Mitchell , Ontario to William Frederick Morenz and <unk> ( Rose ) Pauli , Howie Morenz had three sisters , Freda , Erma and Gertrude , and two brothers , Wilfred and Ezra . Morenz learned his hockey by playing shinny on the Thames River . At the age of eight , he played his first organized game as a goaltender , where he allowed 21 goals in a game . After that game , a coach switched Morenz to rover , a defensive position . Starting the 1916 – 17 junior season as a goaltender , Morenz became a forward when it became apparent his speed was much more suitable for an offensive role , and he helped the Mitchell ice hockey team win the Western Ontario junior championship . After the Morenz family moved to Stratford , a nearby community , in May 1917 , Morenz tried enlisting in the Canadian military but was refused when recruiters learned he was only 15 years old . 
 At the age of 18 , Morenz became an apprentice with the Canadian National Railways ( CNR ) factory in Stratford . When not playing hockey , Morenz bet avidly on horse races and played the ukulele . In 1926 he married Mary McKay ; together , they had three children : Howie , Jr. in 1927 , Donald in 1933 , and Marlene in 1934 . Marlene later married Bernie Geoffrion , who played for both the Canadiens and Rangers from 1950 to 1968 . Their son , Morenz 's grandson , Dan , played for the Canadiens in 1979 @-@ 80 . Dan 's son , Blake , played with the University of Wisconsin and won the Hobey Baker Award as best collegiate player in 2010 . Selected in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators , he made his debut with the Predators in 2011 , the first fourth @-@ generation NHL player . Blake was traded to Montreal in 2012 , meaning that all four generations of the Morenz @-@ Geoffrion family have played within the Canadiens organization .

 In 1920 Morenz joined the Stratford Midgets junior team ( under 20 years old ) , leading the Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA ) in assists and points during the 1920 – 21 regular season , and goals , assists and points in the playoffs . The Midgets won the league title and played in the 1921 Memorial Cup against the Winnipeg Falcons . While Morenz scored a hat trick ( three goals ) in the second game in the series , the Midgets lost the total @-@ goals series 11 – 9 . His performance in the Memorial Cup tournament earned him an invitation to play for the Stratford Indians , a senior league team , for the 1921 – 22 season . While he joined the Indians , he continued to play for the juniors as well . During the playoffs , he led both leagues in goals , assists , and points and he also led the senior league in penalty minutes . Playing exclusively in the senior league in the 1922 – 23 season , he led it in regular season assists , playoff goals , points , and penalty minutes . 
 During a CNR hockey tournament held in December 1922 in Montreal , Morenz scored nine goals in a game for Stratford . A friend of Léo Dandurand , the owner of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League , refereed the game and told Dandurand how good Morenz was . Dandurand went to Stratford in January 1923 to watch Morenz play , and decided he wanted to sign him to the Canadiens . In April he met with William Morenz , because at the age of 20 , Howie was still legally a minor . William told Dandurand that he wanted Howie to finish his apprenticeship at the CNR factory , which would take another two years . However , in July Dandurand learned that Morenz and his father had been in contact with the Toronto St. Patricks , a rival team in the NHL . Fearing that Morenz would sign in Toronto , Dandurand sent his friend , Cecil Hart , to Stratford with instructions to sign Morenz at any cost . On July 7 , 1923 , Morenz signed a contract with the Canadiens for three years with a salary of $ 3 @,@ 500 per year and a $ 1 @,@ 000 signing bonus , a considerable amount for a first @-@ year professional . 
 Right after signing the contract with the Canadiens , Morenz began to reconsider joining them . Stratford residents , as well as his senior team , wanted him to stay , and Morenz yielded to the pressure . He wrote a letter in August to Dandurand , explaining that he could not leave Stratford , and included the cheque given to him as a signing bonus . After receiving the letter , Dandurand phoned Morenz and told him to come to Montreal to talk in person . In Montreal , Morenz began explaining his reasons for not signing to Dandurand but began crying and could not finish . In response , Dandurand falsely threatened that if Morenz did not join the Canadiens , his professional hockey career would be over . Hearing this , Morenz relented and agreed to report to the Canadiens ' training camp later in the year .

 On December 3 , 1923 , Morenz arrived at his first Canadiens training camp and quickly impressed his new teammates . He made his NHL debut on December 26 , 1923 , in Ottawa against the Ottawa Senators , scoring a goal . At the conclusion of the 1923 – 24 season , Morenz 's first in the NHL , he finished with 13 goals and 3 assists in 24 games . Finishing first in the league for the first time in five years , the Canadiens faced the Senators in the playoffs for the NHL championship . In the first game of the two @-@ game , total @-@ goals series , Morenz scored the only goal , and added another goal in the second game as the Canadiens won the series , five goals to two . As the champions of the NHL , the Canadiens played two teams from Western Canada for the Stanley Cup . They defeated the Vancouver Maroons of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) in two games of a best @-@ of @-@ three series and then faced the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League ( WCHL ) . In the first game against Calgary , Morenz scored a hat trick as the Canadiens won by a score of 6 – 1 . He scored another goal in the second game , as Montreal defeated the Tigers 3 – 0 to win their second Stanley Cup championship and Morenz 's first with the team . 
 The following season , Morenz scored 28 goals and 11 assists for 39 points , placing second on the Canadiens and fourth in the NHL in scoring . That was followed with seven goals and eight points in six playoff games , as Montreal lost in the Stanley Cup Finals to the Victoria Cougars of the WCHL . Morenz tied with linemate Aurèle Joliat in leading the Canadiens in scoring in 1925 – 26 with 26 points , finishing fifth in the league . In 1926 – 27 he finished third in the league in goals , with 25 , and points , with 32 , to again lead the Canadiens . The one goal he scored in four playoff games was a series winner in the quarter @-@ finals , eliminating the Montreal Maroons from postseason contention . 
 The 1927 – 28 season was one of Morenz 's best in the NHL . On March 24 , 1928 , in the final game of the regular season , Morenz earned two assists , tying the then @-@ NHL record for assists in a season with 18 and becoming the first player to score 50 points in a season , finishing with 51 . As the league leader in goals , with 33 , assists and points , Morenz was named the recipient of the Hart Trophy as the league 's most valuable player . Though his scoring totals went down in 1928 – 29 , with 17 goals and 27 points , Morenz still led the Canadiens in scoring , and tied for third overall in the league . 
 During the 1929 – 30 season the NHL changed its rules to allow for more scoring . As a result , Morenz finished seventh in the league for scoring with 50 points , including scoring 40 goals for the first time ; this included a game against the New York Americans on March 18 , 1930 , in which he scored five goals . In the playoffs , he added another three goals , including his second Stanley Cup @-@ winning goal , as the Canadiens beat the Boston Bruins for their third Stanley Cup . In the 1930 – 31 season , Morenz scored 28 goals and matched his career high with 51 points , winning his second NHL scoring title , and being awarded the Hart Trophy for the second time . He was also named to the newly created NHL All @-@ Star Team , being selected as the first @-@ team centre , as the top player in that position . In the playoffs , the Canadiens reached the Stanley Cup Final for the second consecutive year , playing the Chicago Black Hawks . Playing with an injured shoulder and being held back by the Black Hawks , Morenz only scored one goal throughout ten playoff games , the final goal of the playoffs , as he won his third Stanley Cup with the Canadiens . 
 The 1931 – 32 season was another productive season for Morenz . With 49 points he finished third in league scoring , and became the first player in NHL history to win the Hart Trophy for a third time , also being named to the First All @-@ Star Team again . In a March 17 , 1932 , game against the New York Americans , Morenz scored his 334th point with an assist , passing Cy Denneny as the NHL record holder for career points . Minor injuries led to Morenz 's point totals going down the following season as he finished second on the Canadiens in scoring behind Joliat , the first time in seven years he did not lead the Canadiens , ending up 10th in the league with 35 points . In the playoffs , he had three assists in two games . The 1933 – 34 season also saw Morenz 's goal and point totals fall , to 8 goals and 21 points . Even with his decline in scoring , he still managed to reach a significant milestone , once again passing Cy Denneny to do so . Against the Detroit Red Wings on December 23 , 1933 , he scored his 249th career goal , to become the NHL leader for career goals . On January 2 , 1934 , Morenz twisted his ankle in a game in New York , bruising the bone and tearing ligaments . It was the first serious injury of his career , and he was unable to play for a month . After returning to the team , Morenz was unable to play at his previous level , and the Canadiens ' fans began booing him . 
 With the decline in production , reports of the Canadiens wanting to trade Morenz began appearing in Montreal newspapers . When the Canadiens began their playoff series against the Chicago Black Hawks , the Canadiens ' general manager , Léo Dandurand , confirmed that several teams wanted to acquire Morenz . After playing the first game with his usual speed and skill , Morenz broke his thumb in the second game , finishing with a goal and an assist for the playoffs . 
 After the playoffs , Morenz addressed the trade rumours , telling a reporter that he would only play for the Canadiens , saying that " when I can 't play for them , I 'll never put on a skate again , " though the Canadiens ' management knew he was too passionate about hockey to quit . During the summer of 1934 , Morenz became concerned about his future with the team . Newspapers continued to write that Morenz would be involved in a trade involving several players and teams . Adding to Morenz 's concern was the lack of response from either of the Canadiens ' owners , Léo Dandurand or Joe Cattarinich , informing him of what was happening . The rumours ended on October 3 , 1934 , when Morenz was traded along with goaltender Lorne Chabot and defenceman Marty Burke , to the Chicago Black Hawks for forwards Leroy Goldsworthy and Lionel Conacher , and defenceman Roger Jenkins . 
 = = = Chicago , New York and Montreal ( 1934 – 37 ) = = = 
 In his first season with the Black Hawks , 1934 – 35 , Morenz played in all 48 games for the team , scoring 8 goals and 34 points , an improvement over the previous season . The Black Hawks reached the playoffs , though Morenz was held pointless in the two games played . The following season was not as good for Morenz . He did not feel comfortable in Chicago , and was being benched , playing fewer minutes than he was used to . After 23 games with the Black Hawks , in which he scored 15 points , Morenz was traded for the second time in his career ; he was sent to the New York Rangers on January 26 , 1936 , for forward Glen <unk> . Playing 19 games for the Rangers , Morenz scored 2 goals and had another 4 assists for 6 points , giving him 21 points over the season . 
 Over the summer of 1936 , the Canadiens re @-@ hired Cecil Hart to be the coach of the team . Hart agreed to the job on one condition : that the Canadiens bring Morenz back to the team . On September 1 , 1936 , Morenz once again joined the Canadiens , his contract being purchased by the team from the Rangers . The Canadiens spent most of the 1936 – 37 season as one of the best teams in the NHL ; Morenz contributed regularly , occasionally showing the speed that had made him notable at the start of his career . By mid @-@ January , he had 4 goals and 20 points , far better totals than previous years . 
 = = = = Final game and death = = = = 
 The Canadiens played the Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28 , 1937 . In the first period , Morenz went after the puck in the Chicago end while being chased by Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert . Morenz lost his balance and fell to the ice , crashing into the boards and catching his left skate in the wooden siding . Seibert , unable to stop , landed on him with full force . The resulting impact snapped Morenz 's left leg , creating a noise heard throughout the rink . Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates , Morenz was taken to Hôpital St @-@ Luc , where it was found that his leg was fractured in four places . 
 While recovering in the hospital , Morenz received many get @-@ well cards and visits from his teammates and players from other NHL teams . So many of them brought drinks that a teammate remarked that " the whisky was on the dresser and the beer was under the bed . " Though there were many visitors , Morenz often found himself alone in the hospital room , unable to move off his bed . To pass the time , he read newspapers to stay up to date with the Canadiens as they finished the season . Since his injury , the team had dropped in the standings , causing Morenz to worry . He began to think he would never play hockey again and became depressed . 
 The Canadiens ' team doctor , Dr. J.A. Hector <unk> , visited Morenz in late February and determined that he had suffered a nervous breakdown . To help Morenz , Dr. <unk> banned all visitors to his room , except for family and Canadiens officials . Mary , Morenz 's wife , and their oldest son , Howie Jr . , visited on most days , and William Morenz , his father , travelled from Stratford during the first week of March and stayed through March 5 . Three days later , on March 8 , Morenz began complaining of chest pains , which doctors attributed to a heart attack . Mary Morenz and Cecil Hart were called to the hospital ; around 11 : 30 pm , Morenz tried to get out of bed to use the washroom but collapsed on the floor and died minutes before his wife and coach arrived . He was 34 . 
 The Canadiens were scheduled to play the Montreal Maroons the evening of March 9 , a game the NHL offered to cancel in honour of Morenz 's death . However Mary insisted the game be played , saying that Morenz would have wanted the game to continue . The players on the Canadiens and Maroons wore black armbands for the game , and prior to the start , two minutes of silence were observed in his honour . A similar event happened in New York , where the New York Rangers and New York Americans had a moment of silence before the start of their game . 
 A funeral was held on March 11 , 1937 , at the Montreal Forum , the arena where the Canadiens played . Fans were allowed to file past the casket , laid at center ice , and 50 @,@ 000 people paid their respects . A rotating guard of honour of four Canadiens stood around the casket which was covered in flowers including a large wreath from Aurèle Joliat that was shaped like the number 7 , Morenz 's number , and a note from Morenz 's three children . The entire service was broadcast on the radio , and after its conclusion he was buried in Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The city of Montreal mourned the death of Morenz for months . To honour him , the Canadiens retired his jersey number , 7 , on November 2 , 1937 , the first time the team honoured a player in that fashion . Five days later , on November 7 , 1937 , a benefit all @-@ star game was held at the Forum to raise money for the Morenz family . A team composed of players from the Canadiens and Maroons was defeated 6 – 5 by a team of players from the other NHL teams . 
 One of the most skilled players in the early NHL , Morenz led the Canadiens in both goals and points from 1926 until 1932 , though he tied with Aurèle Joliat for points in 1926 . At the time of his death , he had set an NHL record for most career points with 472 . When the Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1945 , he was among the first group of nine inductees . A 1950 Canadian Press poll named Morenz the best ice hockey player of the first half of the 20th century . In 1998 he was ranked 15th on The Hockey News ' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players . 
 Through his exciting play , Morenz encouraged the growth of the NHL , helping bring professional hockey to the United States . Watching Morenz play during the 1924 Stanley Cup Final between Montreal and Calgary , Morenz 's first season in the NHL , Charles Adams , the owner of a chain of grocery stores , went back to Boston wanting a hockey team based in the city . That summer , the NHL granted Adams a franchise for the following season , the Boston Bruins . Boxing promoter Tex Rickard , owner of Madison Square Garden , also saw Morenz play early in his career and agreed to add ice to his building for an NHL team known as the New York Americans . As part of the agreement , Morenz and the Canadiens played the first game against the Americans on December 15 , 1925 . 
 Morenz 's daughter Marlene married Bernie Geoffrion , who also played for the Canadiens and Rangers , and was later inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame . When the Canadiens retired Geoffrion 's number on the night of his death on March 11 , 2006 , the team recognized the link between the two men . As Geoffrion 's banner was being raised to the rafters , Morenz ' banner was lowered halfway to the ice . Once Geoffrion 's banner reached Morenz ' banner , the two were raised together .

 = Fortifications of Malta = 
 The fortifications of Malta consist of a number of walled cities , citadels , forts , towers , batteries , redoubts , entrenchments and pillboxes . The fortifications were built over thousands of years , from around 1450 BC to the mid @-@ 20th century , and they are a result of the Maltese islands ' strategic position and natural harbours , which have made them very desirable for various powers . 
 The earliest known fortifications in Malta are defensive walls built around Bronze Age settlements . The Phoenicians , Romans and Byzantines built a number of defensive walls around important settlements , but very little remains of these survive today . By the late medieval period , the main fortifications on Malta were the capital Mdina , the Cittadella on Gozo , the Castrum Maris and a few coastal towers or lookout posts . 
 The fortifications of Malta were greatly improved while the islands were ruled by the Order of St. John between 1530 and 1798 . The Hospitallers built new bastioned fortifications , such as the fortifications of Birgu and Valletta , and upgraded the medieval defences . By the end of the 18th century , Malta had extensive fortifications around the Grand Harbour and Marsamxett , as well as a coastal defence system consisting of towers , batteries , redoubts and entrenchments . 
 Following a brief French occupation , the islands fell under British rule in 1800 . Between the 1870s and the 1900s a number of polygonal forts and batteries were built around Malta 's coastline and along the Great Fault . In the 1930s and 1940s , Fort Campbell , a series of pillboxes and a number of anti @-@ aircraft batteries were constructed , and these were the last fortifications to be built in Malta . 
 Malta 's fortifications are considered to be among the best examples of military architecture anywhere in the world . Major General Whitworth Porter of the Royal Engineers , called Malta " the most powerful artificial fortress in the world " in his 1858 book A History of the Fortress of Malta . In his 1893 book The Story of Malta , Maturin Murray Ballou wrote that " there is not a more complete system of fortifications extant , in any part of the world , than the cordon of defensive structures at Malta . " 
 The British architect Quentin Hughes referred to Malta 's fortifications as " for sheer concentration and majesty quite unmatched " , while judge and historian Giovanni Bonello said that " nowhere in the world are fortifications more extensive , more impressive , more outstanding than they are in Malta . " 
 = = Ancient and Medieval fortifications ( pre @-@ 1530 ) = = 
 The first fortifications in Malta were built during the Bronze Age . At least six sites have been identified as possible fortified settlements . The best preserved of these is the village of Borġ in @-@ Nadur , close to the modern town of <unk> . Around 1450 BC , the inhabitants of the village built a 4.5m high D @-@ shaped bastion to bar access to their village . The wall was built facing inland , showing that the people living in the village were more afraid of attacks from the land than from the sea . 
 In around 700 BC , the Phoenicians founded and fortified the city of Maleth on one of the highest points of the island , far away from the sea . Eventually the city was taken over by the Roman Empire and it was renamed Melite . The city was again renamed Medina by the Arabs which led to its present name Mdina . Its fortifications were modified a number of times over time , and although most were dismantled and rebuilt between the 16th and 18th centuries , some foundations of the ancient Punic @-@ Roman ramparts , as well as various medieval remains , were recently discovered during excavations . 
 The remains of several round towers have been found in Malta , and they are believed to date back to the late Punic or Roman periods . It is possible that these were used as watchtowers , but some historians dispute this since their locations do not really make sense in defensive systems . 
 According to Al @-@ <unk> , when the Arabs captured Malta in 870 AD , they besieged , captured , sacked and dismantled a fortress . 
 By 1241 , the Gran Castello or Cittadella on Gozo was definitely fortified , although a settlement on the hill had existed since the Bronze Age . The city 's fortifications were improved over the years , and the northern walls of the city that still stand today were built around the 15th century by the Crown of Aragon . 
 The Castrum Maris was built sometime in the Middle Ages . The castle definitely existed by the 13th century , and it was involved in the Battle of Malta of 1283 . By the early 16th century , it belonged to the de Nava family . 
 In the early 15th century , the local militia had a number of watch posts around the Maltese islands , and in some cases there might have been fortified coastal watchtowers at these posts . One of these towers is known to have been built at St Elmo Point on the Sciberras Peninsula by the Aragonese in 1488 .

 In 1530 , the Maltese islands along with the North African port city of Tripoli were given to the Order of Saint John by Emperor Charles V. The knights settled in the town of Birgu and made it their capital . Soon after their arrival , the Order rebuilt the Castrum Maris , calling it Fort Saint Angelo . Later on , the entire town of Birgu began to be surrounded by new fortifications , in a similar style to the Order 's earlier defences in Rhodes . Birgu 's land front was built by 1540 . Following the attack of 1551 , the Order realised the need to build more defences . Two forts were built in 1552 - Fort Saint Elmo at the tip of the Sciberras Peninsula , on the site of an Aragonese watchtower , and Fort Saint Michael on Isola . In 1553 , a new fortified city began to be built around Fort Saint Michael , and it was named Senglea after the Grand Master who built it . 
 In 1565 , the Ottomans attacked again in the Great Siege of Malta . Fort Saint Elmo fell after fierce fighting ( in which the Ottoman general Dragut Reis was killed ) , but the knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived . By the end of the siege , most of the fortifications had been destroyed in the attacks , so they were rebuilt . The Grand Master , Jean Parisot de Valette , decided to build a new fortified capital on the Sciberras Peninsula . The first stone of the new city was laid down in 1566 , and it was called Valletta . The city walls , which were constructed mainly in the 1560s and 1570s , remain largely intact to this day , and they include bastions , cavaliers , counterguards and a ditch . The ruined Fort Saint Elmo was rebuilt and integrated into the city walls . The area around St Elmo was strengthened a number of times later on in the 17th century , especially by the building of the Carafa Enceinte in 1687 . 
 With the development of new technologies , by the 17th century it was realised that while Valletta 's fortifications were well designed , they were not strong enough to withstand a heavy attack . Because of this , the Floriana Lines , encircling Valletta 's original land front , were built from 1635 to the 1640s . In the 18th century , a suburb developed between the Floriana Lines and Valletta 's land front , and it became known as Floriana , today a town in its own right . 
 In 1638 , the Santa Margherita Lines began to be built encircling the land fronts of Birgu and <unk> . Works were suspended in 1645 due to a lack of funds , and they remained unfinished for many years . Following the fall of Candia to the Ottomans in 1669 , a second line of fortifications , the Cottonera Lines , began to be built encircling both Birgu and Senglea , as well as the unfinished Santa Margherita Lines . They were begun in 1670 , but works stopped in 1680 again due to a lack of funds . By this time , the bastioned enceinte had been built , although other crucial parts had not yet been constructed . Eventually , some effort was done to complete both the Santa Margherita and Cottonera Lines in the early 18th century , although some of the planned ravelins , cavaliers , ditch and other fortifications were never constructed . Fort San Salvatore was built on one of the Cottonera Lines bastions in 1724 . 
 Fort Ricasoli was built between 1670 and 1698 commanding the eastern arm of the Grand Harbour . It has an irregular plan following the coastline , with bastions , curtains and ravelins . The fort was improved later on in the 18th century . Fort Saint Angelo was also extensively modified in the 1690s , when it was upgraded with the building of various batteries and other defences . 
 From 1723 to 1733 , Fort Manoel was built on Manoel Island in Marsamxett Harbour , so as to protect Valletta 's western flank . The Baroque fort is square in shape , with four corner bastions . It was the last major fort to be built with the bastioned trace in Malta . The Order 's last major fortification in the harbour area was Fort Tigné , built at Tigné Point between 1793 and 1795 . It was built to protect the entrance of Marsamxett , along with Fort Saint Elmo . The fort 's architecture is very different from the Order 's earlier forts , and although very small by 18th century standards , it has been described as among the most revolutionary and influential of Malta 's fortifications as it is a very early example of a polygonal fort . Many other polygonal forts were built by the British later on in the 19th century . 
 = = = Mdina and the Cittadella = = = 
 Although Mdina was no longer the capital city , the Order still strengthened the city 's defences , and gradually upgraded its medieval walls into a gunpowder fortress . In the 1540s , during the magistracy of Juan de Homedes y Coscon , two bastions were built on the corners of the city 's land front . The central De Redin Bastion was built by Grand Master Martin de Redin in the mid @-@ 17th century . The city was damaged during the 1693 Sicily earthquake , and repairs were made over the course of the 18th century . During the rebuilding , the city 's entrance was replaced by a larger gate by the architect Charles François de Mondion in 1724 , and the last modifications were made in 1746 , when Despuig Bastion was completed . There were other plans to strengthen the city but these were not implemented as the Order focused on the fortifications at the harbour area . 
 The defences of Gozo 's Cittadella were also improved by the Order . In 1551 , the city was devastated by an Ottoman raid which took almost Gozo 's entire population as slaves . The city 's entrance and southern walls were later completely rebuilt between 1599 and 1622 , although the city 's northern walls were retained in their original medieval form . The early 17th century modifications included the construction of bastions , cavaliers , magazines and a battery . 
 = = = Coastal fortifications = = = 
 Despite the significant fortifications in the harbour area , the rest of the islands remained mostly undefended until the 17th century , and they were prone to attacks ( such as the raid of 1551 ) . This changed in 1605 , when <unk> Tower was built in <unk> on the island of Gozo . This watchtower no longer exists as it was demolished by the British administration in 1848 . 
 In the following years , more towers were built around the islands . The first group , the Wignacourt towers , were built between 1610 and 1620 . Six of these were built , and they were more than just watchtowers as they formed significant strongpoints intended to protect vulnerable sections of the coast from attack . Of the six towers , one collapsed in around 1715 and another was demolished in 1888 . The other four towers survive to this day . 
 Seven more towers were built between 1637 and 1638 . These were much smaller than the Wignacourt towers , as they were built as watchtowers and a communication link to warn the Order 's base in the Grand Harbour of an attack . In 1647 , Saint Agatha 's Tower was built in <unk> . This was a large tower intended as a strongpoint , and was built in the style of the Wignacourt towers . Two more towers were built at <unk> and <unk> on Gozo in 1650 and 1652 . The ten towers built between 1637 and 1652 are collectively known as the Lascaris towers after the Grand Master who built them , and nine of them survive to this day . 
 Another series of towers were built between 1658 and 1659 . Fourteen towers were built in all , which are together known as the De Redin towers . These were based on the Lascaris towers and had the same function as a communication link . 13 towers were built on mainland Malta having an identical design , and 8 of these survive intact while 2 are in ruins . The fourteenth tower , <unk> ix @-@ <unk> Tower , was built on Gozo in 1661 with a slightly different design . 
 The last coastal watchtower to be built was <unk> Tower , which was constructed in Gozo in 1667 . The tower had almost collapsed but was rebuilt in the early 2000s and it is now in good condition . 
 From 1714 onwards , about 52 batteries and redoubts were built around the coasts of Malta and Gozo . A few of the batteries were built around existing coastal watchtowers , such as <unk> and <unk> Towers . Most of the batteries were destroyed over the years or are in ruins , but a few are still more or less intact , including Mistra , Vendôme , Ferretti , St. Anthony 's , <unk> l @-@ <unk> and St. Mary 's Batteries . Very few redoubts survive , including <unk> , Ximenes and St. George Redoubts . Various entrenchments were also built between the 1720s and 1760s , both around the coastline and along some inland positions . The remains of a few still survive today , including the <unk> Entrenchment and the <unk> Entrenchment . 
 From 1749 to the 1760s , Fort <unk> was built on the island of Gozo . It was intended to be a new fortified city like Valletta , and eventually to replace the Cittadella as the island 's capital . This was unsuccessful , and eventually only the fort was built . It saw some action during the French occupation of 1798 , but its importance eventually diminished . It was converted into a hospital in the 19th century . In the 1990s , the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped , but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact . 
 Between 1793 and 1795 , Saint Lucian Tower and its battery were strengthened with a ditch and an entrenchment @-@ like enclosure , and the complex was renamed Fort Rohan after the reigning Grand Master , Emmanuel de Rohan @-@ Polduc . Most of the fortifications , with the exception of the tower itself , were dismantled and rebuilt by the British later on in the 19th century and the name Fort Rohan fell into disuse . 
 Apart from the knights ' fortifications , over the years various individuals or families built their own fortifications . These were mainly fortified residences or private watchtowers . A notable surviving example is Mamo Tower , built in 1657 in Marsaskala . 
 = = French occupation ( 1798 – 1800 ) = = 
 The French evicted the Order from Malta during the Mediterranean campaign of 1798 , and the Order surrendered after a couple of days . The Maltese , although initially welcoming the French occupiers , rebelled after a couple of months due to a number of reforms and the looting of churches . The insurgents took control of Gozo which became briefly independent , as well as Mdina and the towns and villages of the main island , leaving the French blockaded in the well @-@ defended harbour area . 
 The Maltese insurgents , helped by the British , hastily built various fortifications mainly intended to repel a possible French counter @-@ attack , and at the same time also bombard French positions in the harbour area . The insurgents had various camps , and men in these camps were responsible for a number of batteries , redoubts and entrenchments in the vicinity . The most important batteries were the Corradino Batteries , <unk> Battery , Tal @-@ Borg Battery and Tas @-@ Samra Battery . 
 The fortifications surrounded the entire harbour area , stretching all the way from Sliema to Kalkara . The design of the batteries was based on the coastal batteries and entrenchments built by the Order in the 18th century , while most of the entrenchments consisted of long stretches of rubble walls . They were armed by guns taken from coastal fortifications such as Saint Mary 's Tower . The usefulness of the fortifications was tested in 1799 when a French counter @-@ attack from Fort Manoel was repelled by the insurgent batteries . 
 None of these fortifications survive intact , although some pre @-@ existing buildings that were used as blockhouses may still be seen . San Rocco Battery , one of the insurgents ' fortifications , was the location where Fort Saint Rocco was built later on in the late 19th century .

 The British took over the Maltese islands as a protectorate in 1800 , and later as a colony in 1813 . They initially used the Hospitaller fortifications without any alterations . Under the military theory of the time , the Royal Navy 's Mediterranean Fleet was regarded as the most reliable protection against invasion , and in fact the British Civil Commissioner , Henry Pigot , wanted to demolish the majority of Valletta 's fortifications in 1801 , although this was never done . During the British period , the various forts of the Order were rearmed , refitted and altered a number of times to keep up with the latest military technology . 
 In the 1850s , the British built Fort Verdala and St. Clement 's Retrenchment in the Cottonera area , while Lascaris Battery was built in Valletta . Later on in the 19th century , parts of the Cottonera Lines , Santa Margherita Lines and the fortifications of Senglea were demolished to make way for extensions of the Malta Dockyard . Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , the British built barracks in various parts of the island , such as Tigné Point and Pembroke . 
 In 1866 , Colonel William Jervois produced a report entitled " Memorandum with reference to the improvements to the defences of Malta and Gibraltar , rendered necessary by the introduction of Iron Plated Ships and powerful rifled guns " , in which he gave Malta ( along with Gibraltar , Halifax and Bermuda ) the status of an " imperial fortress " . A programme to improve Malta 's fortifications began soon after , and a number of new polygonal forts and batteries were built , including Sliema Point Battery ( 1872 ) , Fort St. Rocco ( 1872 – 73 ) and Fort Leonardo ( 1875 – 78 ) . 
 From 1871 to 1880 , the Corradino Lines were built on the Corradino Heights . The V @-@ shaped trace and ditch were meant to protect the dockyard and harbour from landward attacks . They were abandoned in the early 1900s due to advancements in technology , although they saw some use once again in World War II . 
 Starting from 1875 , the Victoria Lines , originally known as the North West Front , were built along the northern part of Malta , dividing it from the more heavily populated south . The system of defences consisted of a line of fortifications flanked by defensive towers , along with entrenchments and gun emplacements . Several artillery batteries were planned , but only San Giovanni Battery and <unk> Battery were actually built . Three forts were also built along the lines : Fort <unk> , Fort Madalena and Fort Mosta . The lines were completed in 1899 , but exercises in 1900 proved that they were of dubious defensive value , and the entire system was decommissioned in 1907 , with the exception of the coastal towers . Today , parts of the lines have collapsed but other parts in the countryside , including the three forts , still survive . Another fort , Fort Pembroke , was built between 1875 and 1878 to cover the gap between the Victoria Lines and the harbour area . 
 The British also built a number of forts to protect Marsaxlokk Harbour . These included Fort San Lucian ( 1874 – 78 ) , Fort <unk> ( 1876 – 88 ) , Fort Tas @-@ <unk> ( 1879 – 83 ) . In 1881 and 1882 , Saint Paul 's Battery and <unk> Battery were built in Marsaxlokk and Marsaskala respectively . 
 Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100 @-@ ton guns , the British feared an Italian attack on Malta , as the ships could fire on Malta 's batteries , destroying them one after the other , while keeping outside their guns ' range . To prevent this , the British requested that four 100 @-@ ton guns be built . Two of these were installed in Malta , and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns . Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886 . The gun at Rinella still exists . 
 From 1888 to 1910 , a new series of fortifications were built to house breech @-@ loading guns . These were Della Grazie Battery , Spinola Battery , Garden Battery , Wolseley Battery , Pembroke Battery and Fort <unk> . The latter was the last polygonal fort to be built in Malta . 
 = = = World Wars and aftermath = = = 
 After the early 20th century , few fortifications were built in Malta . However , new military installations such as airfields began to be built in World War I , when the seaplane base of RAF <unk> and the airfield at Marsa were built . More airfields were built in the interwar period and the Second World War , including RAF Hal Far , RAF Ta ' Kali , RAF Luqa , RAF Safi , RAF <unk> and Ta ' Lambert Airfield . 
 From the Abyssinian Crisis of 1935 onwards , the British built many pillboxes in Malta for defence in case of an Italian invasion . Many others were built during World War II . Many pillboxes still exist , especially on the north eastern part of the island . A few of them have been restored and are cared for , but many others were demolished . Some pillboxes are still being destroyed as they are not considered to have any architectural or historic value . 
 The last fort to be built in Malta was Fort Campbell , which was built near <unk> between late 1937 and 1938 . The design of the fort is completely different from the earlier fortifications in Malta as it was designed to counter the new threat of aerial bombardment . It had an irregular plan and its perimeter was guarded by machine gun posts and a few rifle loopholes . The buildings inside were scattered so as not to create a concentration of buildings . The fort still exists , although it is largely in ruins . 
 During the Second World War , the Lascaris War Rooms were built in Valletta to serve as the war headquarters for the defence of Malta . They were later used in the headquarters of the Allied invasion of Sicily . Throughout the war , many air @-@ raid shelters also were dug in the limestone rock of the islands , either by the government or by individuals or families , to protect the civilian population of Malta from Italian or German aerial bombardment . Many of the shelters still exist , and a few are open to the public . 
 Many anti @-@ aircraft batteries , gun positions and radar stations were also built throughout the course of the war . 
 Many of the fortifications were decommissioned between the 1950s and 1970s . Some were left abandoned while others were used for a variety of purposes , such as private residences , restaurants , police stations or farms . Some barracks , such as those at Mtarfa and Pembroke , were converted to housing estates . 
 Several forts and historic military buildings are still in use by the Armed Forces of Malta , such as Luqa Barracks , Fort Madalena and Fort Mosta .

 = = = Conservation and restoration = = = 
 Today , the architectural and historical value of Malta 's fortifications is widely acknowledged , and many also serve as tourist attractions . All fortifications were included on the Antiquities List of 1925 , and virtually all surviving Hospitaller fortifications are now listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands , Malta 's national heritage register . The fortified city of Valletta has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1980 . The other fortifications around Malta 's harbour area , the fortified cities of Mdina and the Cittadella , as well as the Victoria Lines have been on the tentative list of World Heritage Sites since 1998 . 
 From the 1970s onwards , some of the fortifications , especially those which were abandoned , became dilapidated and often vandalized . However , since the beginning of the 21st century , a number of fortifications have been restored or are undergoing restoration . 
 The National Trust of Malta , Din l @-@ Art Ħelwa , was responsible for the restoration of a number of Hospitaller coastal fortifications from the 1970s onwards . Towers and batteries restored by Din l @-@ Art Ħelwa include Wignacourt Tower ( 1975 – 76 and 2003 ) , Mamo Tower ( 1994 – 95 ) , <unk> Tower ( 1995 ) , St. Mary 's Battery ( 1996 – 97 and 2003 – 04 ) , <unk> Tower ( 1997 ) , St. Mark 's Tower ( 1997 – 98 ) , St. Agatha 's Tower ( 1999 – 2001 ) , St. Mary 's Tower ( 2002 and 2005 ) and <unk> Tower ( 2004 ) . Din l @-@ Art Ħelwa is currently restoring St. Anthony 's Battery and <unk> Tower . 
 <unk> Wirt <unk> also restored a number of Maltese fortifications , including the Saluting Battery and Rinella Battery . It is currently restoring Mistra Battery . 
 From 2001 onwards , MIDI plc began restoration of Fort Manoel as part of its Manoel Island project . The restoration included rebuilding the Chapel of St Anthony of Padua , which had been bombed in World War II . In 2008 , MIDI also restored Fort Tigné as part of its development of Tigné Point . The 19th century Garden Battery , which was believed to have been destroyed in the World War II , was rediscovered during the Tigné Point project , and MIDI decided to restore it as well . 
 The first plans to restore the fortifications of Valletta , Birgu , Mdina and the Cittadella were made in 2006 . 
 In 2008 , restoration began in Mdina , Birgu and the Cittadella . In Mdina , some of the bastions had started to slip down the clay slopes , and steel rods were inserted in the walls to reinforce them . Throughout the course of restoration , a number of archaeological remains have been found , including remains of Mdina 's Punic @-@ Roman and medieval walls , a bastion and a caponier in Birgu , the Cittadella 's original entrance , and a number of other features . 
 In Valletta , restoration started in 2010 , with the project being described as " the biggest in a century " . Squatters were evicted from public lands around the fortifications . Restoration of the upper part of Fort Saint Elmo was completed in 2015 . The Chapel of St Roche on St Michael 's Counterguard , which was bombed in World War II , was rebuilt in 2014 as part of the restoration . 
 Parts of the fortifications of Senglea began to be restored in 2015 . 
 = = = Fortifications Interpretation Centre = = = 
 The Fortifications Interpretation Centre ( FIC ) is a public institution dedicated to communicating and exhibiting Malta 's military architecture . It is located in a building adjoining Saint Andrew 's Bastion , part of the city walls of Valletta . The building was originally a bombproof magazine and artillery school that was built sometime during the reign of Hugues <unk> de <unk> in the late 16th century . The uppermost floor had been destroyed in World War II and the rest of the building was subsequently used as an examination hall . The building was restored and the upper floor rebuilt in a project co @-@ financed by the European Regional Development Fund , and the FIC was opened on 16 February 2013 . 
 The FIC includes information guides on the fortifications of Malta , going back to the first fortifications at Borġ in @-@ Nadur and focusing especially on those built by the Order and the British . It contains models of Maltese forts , as well as informative panels describing fortifications around the world , thus putting Malta 's fortifications in context . 
 = = Heraldry = = 
 Malta 's fortifications are featured a number of times on the islands ' heraldry . The coat of arms of Malta contains a mural crown in gold with a sally port and eight turrets ( five of which are visible ) , which represents the fortifications as well as Malta 's status as a city @-@ state . The coats of arms of the five regions of Malta have a similar crown but with five turrets , all of which are visible . A mural crown with four visible turrets can be seen on the coats of arms of Valletta , Mdina and Birgu , indicating their status as capital city or former capitals . Another version with four turrets ( three visible ) can be seen on the coats of arms of <unk> , Senglea , <unk> , <unk> , Żabbar , <unk> , <unk> and Victoria , indicating the status of a city . 
 The coat of arms of <unk> features a heraldic representation of Santa Maria delle Grazie Tower , a now @-@ demolished Wignacourt tower . In addition , De Redin towers are featured on the coats of arms of the Armed Forces of Malta ( as well as its Air Wing ) , the Malta Stock Exchange , and the town of Pembroke . The coat of arms of Mtarfa feature a representation of Mtarfa Barracks , reflecting the role of the British military in the founding of the town .

 Ebbor Gorge is a limestone gorge in Somerset , England , designated and notified in 1952 as a 63 @.@ 5 @-@ hectare ( 157 @-@ acre ) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in the Mendip Hills . It was donated to the National Trust in 1967 and is now managed by Natural England as a National Nature Reserve . 
 The gorge was cut into the Clifton Down Limestone , an example of Carboniferous Limestone , by water . The floor of the gorge is impermeable Millstone Grit and Lower Coal Measures . The rare mineral mendipite has also been found . The site was occupied by humans in the Neolithic Era and their tools and flint arrow heads have been discovered , along with pottery from the Bronze Age . There are also fossils of small mammals from the Late Devensian . The nature reserve provides a habitat for a variety of flora and fauna , including flowers , butterflies and bats .

 Ebbor Gorge lies on the southwest @-@ facing slope of the Mendip Hills and consists of a steep @-@ sided ravine cut into 350 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old Carboniferous Limestone of the <unk> . The gorge was cut into Clifton Down Limestone by meltwater in the Pleistocene Epoch . The rocks of the area lie above a thrust fault formed during the Variscan orogeny . Millstone Grit and Lower Coal Measures form an impermeable floor to this valley . An example of the rare mineral mendipite was found at the head of the gorge . 
 A stream issuing to the west of the site runs down the tributary valley of Hope Wood before joining the main gorge . The original watercourse which may have cut the gorge into the limestone became diverted underground and now emerges at Wookey Hole Caves to form the River Axe . 
 = = History = = 
 Various caves within the gorge were inhabited by neolithic people from which flint tools are held in the Wells and Mendip Museum . One particularly fine flint flake can be seen in the museum at King John 's Hunting Lodge in Axbridge . Human and animal bones from the Neolithic were recovered from Outlook Cave in 1907 . Bones from the Palaeolithic have been found at Savory 's Hole . 
 Several caves occur within the Gorge , of which Bridged Pot and Gully Cave provide some of the best Late Devensian small @-@ mammal assemblages known from Britain . Most of the deposits remain in situ and include steppe pika , Arctic lemming , Norway lemming , various voles , red deer and reindeer . Bronze Age finds include pottery from the Beaker culture , a stone axe and flint knife .

 A 40 @-@ hectare ( 99 @-@ acre ) area of the gorge is owned by the National Trust , and managed by Natural England as a National Nature Reserve . The land was donated to the National Trust by Mrs G.W. Hodgkinson , in 1967 , in memory of Winston Churchill . The site was purchased in 1931 by Wookey Hole Caves Ltd . 
 The site is close to Wookey Hole village and caves and offers views across the Somerset Levels to Glastonbury Tor and beyond . There are three marked trails of varying lengths around the steeply wooded gorge , the longest being 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) long , the shortest of which is suitable for wheelchair users . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Because of the ecology of the area 63 @.@ 5 hectares ( 157 acres ) was designated as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1952 . The ground flora is indicative of the calcareous nature of the site , with dog 's mercury ( Mercurialis perennis ) being locally dominant . Many of the associated species are characteristic of ancient woodland . Wood anemone ( Anemone <unk> ) and common bluebell ( Hyacinthoides non @-@ scripta ) are both locally abundant . The valley of the main gorge is humid and provides ideal conditions for fungi and ferns . It contains a substantial assemblage of bryophytes with over 120 species recorded including the nationally rare <unk> <unk> and the very rare <unk> <unk> . 
 The varied age and canopy structure of woodland encourages a high diversity of butterflies , nationally scarce species including the white @-@ letter hairstreak ( <unk> <unk> ) and high brown fritillary ( Argynnis <unk> ) , while species such as the <unk> blue ( Lysandra <unk> ) and brown argus ( Aricia <unk> ) occur on the limestone grassland . Greater horseshoe bats ( Rhinolophus ferrumequinum ) and lesser horseshoes ( Rhinolophus hipposideros ) regularly use sites in the Gorge as <unk> roosts . The site also supports birds of prey and a few red deer .

 The 2002 UEFA Cup Final was a football match played on 8 May 2002 , between Feyenoord of the Netherlands and Borussia Dortmund of Germany . Feyenoord won the match 3 – 2 . It was the 31st UEFA Cup Final and was held in the <unk> Stadion in Rotterdam , which is the home ground of Feyenoord . This was the first time since the introduction of single – match finals in the UEFA Cup in 1998 , that the final had been played at a finalists home ground . Previous to this match , Feyenoord had not won a European trophy since 1974 , when they beat Tottenham Hotspur to win the UEFA Cup . Borussia Dortmund , who had already won the Bundesliga title , were hoping to join Ajax , Bayern Munich and Juventus in being the only clubs to win all three European trophies . Feyenoord 's victory marked the first European triumph for a Dutch club in seven years , after Ajax won the Champions League in 1995 .

 Dortmund were drawn against Copenhagen of Denmark in the third round and won the first leg 1 – 0 away from home with Heiko <unk> scoring in injury time . The second leg produced the same result , this time , Jan @-@ Derek Sørensen scored in the 89th minute to secure Dortmund a place in the fourth round . In the fourth round , Dortmund were drawn against Lille of France , who had also joined the UEFA Cup , after finishing third in their Champions League group . Dortmund played the first leg away from home and got an away goal , after a 1 – 1 draw . Dortmund had opened the scoring in the 67th minute when Ewerthon scored after a rebound , though the lead only lasted five minutes as <unk> <unk> scored a half @-@ volley on 72 minutes to tie the game 1 – 1 , going into the second leg in Dortmund . In a rain @-@ soaked second leg at the Westfalenstadion , the match finished in a 0 – 0 draw , meaning Borussia went through to the quarter – finals on the away goals rule . 
 Borussia were drawn against Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic in the quarter – finals , the first leg was drawn 0 – 0 draw in Prague . The draw was significant because it was the first time in the competition , that Liberec had failed to win at home . Dortmund won the second leg 4 – 0 , after goals from Márcio Amoroso on 51 minutes , Jan Koller on 57 minutes , Lars Ricken on 70 minutes , and finally Ewerthon on 89 minutes . Borussia faced stronger opponents in the semi @-@ finals , when they were drawn with the then five times champions of Europe ; Milan . Nevertheless , Borussia won the first leg 4 – 0 , after a hat @-@ trick from Márcio Amoroso , and a goal on 63 minutes from Jörg Heinrich . Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was not surprised with the result , stating that , " We knew they had quick strikers . I am more surprised by the terrible performance of our team . The problem stemmed from the wings . I had no reason to change the team because Rui Costa has not trained for ten days . It will be very difficult but it is our duty to give it our best and to try and qualify . " In the second leg , Milan won 3 – 1 , with Filippo Inzaghi , and Cosmin Contra scoring within 18 minutes . However , Milan did not get their third goal until injury time when Serginho scored a penalty after Inzaghi was adjudged to have been pulled back by Christoph <unk> . With Milan still needing one goal to force extra time , Lars Ricken scored for Dortmund in the fourth minute of injury time to put the club into their first European final since winning the 1997 Champions League Final .

 Feyenoord went straight to the Group stage of the Champions League after finishing second in the Eredivisie but were eliminated after only winning one game , and finishing six points behind Sparta Prague , and were consequently drawn against SC Freiburg of Germany in the third round of the UEFA Cup . Feyenoord won the first leg 1 – 0 , after a late goal from Shinji Ono . The second leg was drawn 2 – 2 , however Feyenoord came close to going out , as Freiburg took a 2 – 0 lead on 49 minutes with goals from Sebastian Kehl and Levan <unk> , to make the aggregate score 2 – 1 in Freiburg 's favour . But on 57 minutes , Pierre van Hooijdonk pulled a goal back , to make it 2 – 2 on aggregate , which would see Feyenoord going through due to the away goal rule . Feyenoord secured their place in the fourth round when Leonardo scored in the 86th minute . Feyenoord faced Rangers of Scotland in the fourth round with the tie proving to be a close affair . The first leg ended 1 – 1 , in Glasgow , Feyenoord had gone ahead on seventy two minutes through Shinji Ono , but Rangers equalised after Peter Løvenkrands was brought down by Glenn <unk> on 81 minutes . Barry Ferguson scored the subsequent penalty . The second leg in Rotterdam ended 3 – 2 in Feyenoord 's favor , the match was notable for the sending off of one player on each side Patrick Paauwe for Feyenoord and Neil McCann for Rangers . 
 Feyenoord were paired with fellow Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in the quarter – finals , and the tie came down to a penalty shootout , which Feyenoord won 5 – 4 . The first leg was drawn 1 – 1 with Feyenoord taking the lead in first half injury time through Pierre van Hooijdonk . PSV equalised two minutes after the restart when Mateja Kežman scored on 47 minutes . The second leg was again drawn 1 – 1 , with PSV taking the lead on 75 minutes , when Mark van Bommel scored from outside the penalty area . That looked to have sent PSV into the semi @-@ finals , but with seconds remaining , Van Hooijdonk scored from Johan Elmander 's cross to send the tie into extra @-@ time . PSV were reduced to ten men in extra time when Van Bommel was sent off for a second bookable offence but they still managed to hold out for the extra 30 minutes to force a penalty shootout . All penalties were converted until Giorgi <unk> stepped up , and saw his penalty saved . Feyenoord converted their subsequent penalties , with Van Hooijdonk putting away the vital fifth penalty . Like Borussia , Feyenoord faced opposition from the city of Milan in the semi @-@ finals , in the shape of Internazionale . Around 10 @,@ 000 Feyenoord fans made the trip to the scene of Feyenoord ’ s 1970 European Cup victory for the first leg . Feyenoord won the first leg 1 – 0 to gain a vital away goal after Iván Córdoba scored an own goal . The second leg started well for Feyenoord after going 2 – 0 up inside 34 minutes , due to goals from Van Hooijdonk and Jon Dahl Tomasson , to put Feyenoord 3 – 0 up on aggregate . Inter came back into the tie in the last minutes when they pulled two goals back through Javier Zanetti and Mohamed <unk> , but Feyenoord secured their place in the final with a 3 – 2 aggregate victory .

 Feyenoord and Borussia Dortmund had the two highest scorers in the competition that season in Pierre van Hooijdonk , who finished top of the scoring charts with eight goals , and Márcio Amoroso , who scored five goals overall . Both players added to their tallies during this match with Van Hooijdonk scoring two goals and Amoroso scoring one goal . 
 The match was the last for Borussia Dortmund veteran Jürgen Kohler , who was retiring after this match , however , the match did not go as intended as he was sent off after 31 minutes . The sides had met twice before in European competition , drawing on both occasions in the 1999 – 2000 UEFA Champions League . Borussia Dortmund were also boosted before kick @-@ off by the news that Stefan Reuter had passed a late fitness test on his injured back .

 The first shot on goal was registered by Bonaventure Kalou , who forced a save out of Jens Lehmann . After 10 minutes , Shinji Ono spotted Lehmann off his line but sent his lofted shot wide of the target . This sparked Dortmund into life ; they were thwarted when Patrick Paauwe intercepted Jan Koller just as he was looking to get his shot away . On 15 minutes , they came even closer to breaking the deadlock , when Amoroso picked out Tomáš Rosický ; however , he shot straight at Edwin <unk> . On 19 minutes , Pierre van Hooijdonk came close to scoring with a free kick , which hit the right @-@ hand post . Feyenoord 's Tomasz <unk> was then booked for dissent on 23 minutes , and following the resulting free kick , <unk> came close to scoring , though his shot went over the crossbar after Ewerthon 's pass had sent him through . 
 The deadlock was broken on 31 minutes when Jürgen Kohler , who was playing his last game for Dortmund , pulled back Jon Dahl Tomasson in the Dortmund penalty area ; Kohler was shown a straight red card , and Van Hooijdonk converted the subsequent penalty , dispatching it to Jens Lehmann 's right hand side . Feyenoord made it 2 – 0 seven minutes later when Van Hooijdonk , scored a free kick from the edge of the area , his eighth goal over the course of the season 's competition .

 After half time , Dortmund were handed a way back into the match when Márcio Amoroso was brought down by Patrick Paauwe . Paauwe was spared Kohler 's fate as he only received a yellow card . Amoroso scored the following penalty and the score was 2 – 1 . Two minutes later , Amoroso was cautioned for diving in an attempt to win another spot kick . Just three minutes after Dortmund scored , Jon Dahl Tomasson who was playing his last game for Feyenoord before his move to Milan , scored after beating the offside trap , and being put through by Shinji Ono . Dortmund once again found a way back into the match when Jan Koller volleyed home his shot from 25 metres on 58 minutes , after capitalizing on a weak defensive header . Dortmund now assumed the ascendancy with attack after attack , whilst Feyenoord seemed content to sit back and try to see the game out . Dortmund tried everything to find the equaliser replacing Lars Ricken with Jörg Heinrich , and Ewerthon was replaced by Otto <unk> , however it was to no avail as Feyenoord saw the game out to win 3 – 2 and continue their streak of never losing a European final . 
 A huge party erupted both inside and outside De Kuip not only because of the title , but also because the final was held two days after Rotterdam 's political hero Pim Fortuyn was murdered . Many Feyenoord fans were still full of emotion before and after the match . As a result of Fortuyn 's murder , the victory was not officially celebrated in <unk> Square with their fans . During Feyenoord 's UEFA Cup run , a parody was launched of the song " Put Your Hands Up " by Black & White Brothers , " Put Your Hands Up for Pi @-@ Air " , as a tribute to Pierre van Hooijdonk .

 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Bioscope from December 22 , 1910 . It states : " A shortage is discovered in the accounts of John Hill , a young bank cashier . The manager of the bank agrees to give him three days ' time in which to make good the shortage . John confides in his young wife , May , and a young reporter interviews May about her husband 's shortage . He becomes interested in the plucky young woman , and decides to suppress the story . The husband fails to raise the money , and leaves his clothes , with a note telling of his intended suicide , on a wharf at the water 's edge . After five years the young reporter wins May for his bride . On the day of their wedding , John is attracted to the house where the ceremony is to take place . Hearing of the many rich gifts which the bride has received , he enters the house , and witnesses a love scene between the young reporter and his ( John 's ) wife . He finds it impossible to escape by the way he entered , and attempts to leave by the floor window , falls to the ground and is killed . Here Hastings finds him , and has the body carried away , and leads May to the altar . "

 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The plot was likened by Walton of The Moving Picture News to Enoch Arden , but the story differs in several ways . Published by Alfred , Lord Tennyson in 1864 , the poem tells of the eponymous character who becomes shipwrecked on a desert island and returns home a decade later to find his wife has remarried and they have a new child . For the sake of his wife 's happiness , he never lets her know that he is alive . The plot differs because the husband willingly fakes his death and returns on the day of the wedding . Rather than announce himself , he attempts to leave and dies in the process , his body is removed by the prospective husband before marrying her . The similarity with the poem comes from refusing to confront or interrupt the wedding by revealing the fact that he is alive is ensured by John 's true death at the climax . The New York Dramatic Mirror noted that the journalists arrived to photograph and cover the apparent suicide too quickly , making it illogical that the fake suicide would not have been revealed . 
 The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . Cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying the three leading actors . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The single reel drama , approximately 1000 feet long , was released on September 13 , 1910 . The film had a wide release , with theater advertisements known in Kansas , Maryland , Pennsylvania , and Indiana . Some later advertisements for the film may have been referring to the Kalem Company 's Tangled Lives released in May 1911 . The Kalem film is extant . Rare typographical errors also resulted in the Reliance Film Company having a film of this name in some advertisements , but this is an error on Tangled Lines . The film was released in Britain on December 22 , 1910 . 
 Reviews for the film were mostly positive , with Walton of The Moving Picture News stating , " [ It is another ] variant of Enoch Arden , with a newspaperman interjected . The resurrected undesirable husband is cleverly eliminated . The coincidences are too miraculous to suit a plain newspaperman . " The New York Dramatic Mirror agreed in premise that the plot of the film had been done before , but stated , " ... the Thanhouser people have done it fairly well and added a few details which , while not quite logical , give it some new interest . " The Moving Picture World offered a neutral summary of the plot , but concluded that the film " is a graphic illustration of conditions which might arise almost any time , and develops an interestingly dramatic story as it proceeds . " One local review of the film called it " splendid " , but either by typographical error or for reasons unknown , gives a different story of the plot and even stating that the wife fell to her death by accident when attempting to see her .

 = = History and etymology = = 
 Briar Creek was historically known as the " <unk> " to the area 's Native Americans . This name was a Lenni Lenape word for " sweet briar " . However , the creek was also referred to as " <unk> Creek " by white soldiers and explorers during the time of the American Revolutionary War . By 1770 , some maps began referring to the creek as Bryar Creek , which became the more common name by the end of the eighteenth century and remained so as late as 1840 . However , the spelling gradually changed to Brier Creek and then Briar Creek . 
 Up to approximately 1770 , the area around Briar Creek was inhabited by the Lenni Lenape Indians . They built villages on the banks of the creek . The Shawanese also had a village at the mouth of the creek . In the 1770s , European settlers arrived in the area . The White family from New Jersey was among the first families of settlers to arrive in the Briar Creek valley . The Briar Creek area was one of the first places in Columbia County to be settled , on account of the high level of fertility of the land . The area around Briar Creek was part of Northumberland County in the late 1700s . In 1799 , Samuel Ely was granted a patent from the state of Pennsylvania for 307 acres of land on Briar Creek known as " Manheim " . In 1806 , he gained a 426 @-@ acre tract of land on the creek . This tract was known as " Quincy " . Ely 's four sons inherited the land . 
 In the beginning of the 1800s , a number of mills were built on tributaries of the creek . A number of other industries were established in the watershed in the early 1800s , including a sawmill , a woolen mill , an iron furnace , and a tannery . In the second half of the 1800s , railroads began to be built in the watershed . Heavy industries and fisheries also began to appear in the area around this time . 
 By 1911 , two dams had been constructed on Glen Brook ( a <unk> of Briar Creek ) in Briar Creek Township two miles north of Berwick . In 1911 , the first dam , known as Number One , had a capacity of 15 million gallons . The second dam , known as Number Two , had a capacity of 7 @.@ 5 million gallons . In 1911 , a third dam was under construction several hundred feet downstream of the two aforementioned dams . It was intended to have a capacity of 23 @.@ 8 million gallons .

 = William Claiborne = 
 William Claiborne ( c . 1600 – c . 1677 ) ( also spelled " William <unk> " ) was an English pioneer , surveyor , and an early settler in the colonies / provinces of Virginia and Maryland and around the Chesapeake Bay . Claiborne became a wealthy planter , a trader , and a major figure in the politics of the colonies . He was a central figure in the disputes between the colonists of Virginia and the later settling of Maryland , partly because of his earlier trading post on Kent Island in the mid @-@ way of the Chesapeake Bay , which provoked the first naval military battles in North American waters . Claiborne repeatedly attempted and failed to regain Kent Island from the Maryland Calverts , sometimes by force of arms , after its inclusion in the lands that were granted by a 1632 Royal Charter to the Calvert family ( to Sir George Calvert , first Baron and Lord Baltimore , ( 1579 @-@ 1632 ) , by the reigning King of England , Charles I , ( 1600 – 1649 , reigned 1625 to execution , 1649 ) , thus becoming Maryland territory . 
 A Puritan , Claiborne sided with Parliament during the English Civil War of 1642 – 1651 and was appointed to a commission charged with subduing and managing the Virginia and Maryland colonies . He played a role in the submission of Virginia to parliamentary rule in this period . Following the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 , he retired from involvement in the politics of the Virginia colony . He died around 1677 at his plantation , " Romancoke " , on Virginia 's Pamunkey River . According to historian Robert Brenner , " William Claiborne may have been the most consistently influential politician in Virginia throughout the whole of the pre @-@ Restoration period " . 
 = = Early life and emigration to America = = 
 Claiborne was born the county of Kent in England in 1600 to Thomas <unk> , an alderman and lord mayor from King 's Lynn , Norfolk , who made his living as a small @-@ scale businessman involved in a variety of industries , including the salt and fish trades , and Sarah Smith , the daughter of a London brewer . The family name was spelled alternately as <unk> , <unk> , or Claiborne . William Claiborne , who was baptized on 10 August 1587 , was the younger of two sons . The family 's business was not profitable enough to make it rich , and so Claiborne 's older brother was apprenticed in London , becoming a merchant involved in hosiery and , eventually , the tobacco trade . 
 However , Claiborne was offered a position as a land surveyor in the new colony of Virginia , and arrived at Jamestown , on the north shore of the James River in 1621 . The position carried a 200 acre ( 80 hectare ) land grant , a salary of £ 30 per year , and the promise of fees paid by settlers who needed to have their land grants surveyed . His political acumen quickly made him one of the most successful Virginia colonists , and within four years of his arrival he had secured grants for 1 @,@ 100 acres ( 445 hectares ) of land and a retroactive salary of £ 60 a year from the Virginia Colony 's council . He also managed to survive the March 1622 attacks by native / Indian <unk> on the Virginia settlers that killed more than 300 colonists . His financial success was followed by political success , and he gained appointment as Councilor in 1624 and Secretary of State for the Colony in 1626 . Around 1627 , he began to trade for furs with the native Susquehannock Indians from further north on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and two of its largest tributaries , the Potomac and Susquehanna Rivers . To facilitate this trade , Claiborne wanted to establish a trading post on Kent Island in the mid @-@ way of the Chesapeake Bay , which he intended to make the center of a vast mercantile empire along the Atlantic Coast . Claiborne found both financial and political support for the Kent Island venture from London merchants Maurice Thomson , William Cloberry , John de la Barre , and Simon Turgis . 
 = = Kent Island and the first dispute with Maryland = = 
 In 1629 , George Calvert , 1st Baron Baltimore , arrived in Virginia , having traveled south from Avalon , his failed colony on Newfoundland . Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians , both because his Catholicism offended them as Protestants , and because it was no secret that Calvert desired a charter for a portion of the land that the Virginians considered their own . After a brief stay , Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter , and Claiborne , in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony , was sent to England to argue the Virginians ' case . This happened to be to Claiborne 's private advantage , as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island . 
 Calvert , a former high official in the government of King James I , asked the Privy Council for permission to build a colony , to be called Carolina , on land south of the Virginia settlements in area of the modern @-@ day North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia . Claiborne arrived soon afterwards and expressed the concerns of Virginia that its territorial integrity was being threatened . He was joined in his protests by a group of London merchants who planned to build a sugar colony in the same area . Claiborne , still intent on his own project , received a royal trading commission through one of his London supporters in 1631 , one which granted him the right to trade with the natives on all lands in the mid @-@ Atlantic where there was not already a patent in effect . 
 Claiborne sailed for Kent Island on 28 May 1631 with indentured servants recruited in London and money for his trading post , likely believing Calvert 's hopes defeated . He was able to gain the support of the Virginia Council for his project and , as a reward for London merchant Maurice Thomson 's financial support , helped Thomson and two associates get a contract from Virginia guaranteeing a monopoly on tobacco . Claiborne 's Kent Island settlers established a small plantation on the island and appointed a clergyman . While the settlement on Kent Island was progressing , the Privy Council had proposed to Sir George Calvert , former Secretary of State for the King that he be granted a charter for lands north of the Virginia colony , in replacement for the unsuccessful settlements of his earlier colony of Avalon in Newfoundland ( eastern modern Canada ) , in order to create pressure on the Dutch settlements further north along the Delaware and Hudson Rivers ( modern states of Delaware , New Jersey and New York ) . Calvert accepted , though he died in 1632 before the charter could be formally signed by King Charles I , and the Royal Grant and Charter for the new colony of Maryland was instead granted to his son , Cecilius Calvert , on 20 June 1632 . This turn of events was unfortunate for Claiborne , since the Maryland charter included all lands on either side of the Chesapeake Bay north of the mouth of the Potomac River , a region which included Claiborne 's proposed trading post on Kent Island , mid @-@ way on the Bay . The Virginia Assembly , still in support of Claiborne and now including representatives of the Kent Island settlers , issued a series of proclamations and protests both before and after when the news of the granting of the Maryland charter reached across the ocean , claiming the lands for Virginia and protesting the charter 's legality . 
 Claiborne 's first appeal to royal authority in the dispute , which complained both that the lands in the Maryland charter were not really unsettled , as the charter claimed , and that the charter gave so much power to Calvert that it undermined the rights of the settlers , was rejected by the Lords of Foreign Plantations in July 1633 . The following year , the main body of Calvert 's settlers arrived in the Chesapeake and established a permanent settlement on <unk> lands at St. Mary 's City . With the support of the Virginia establishment , Claiborne made clear to Calvert that his allegiance was to Virginia and royal authority , and not to the proprietary authority in Maryland . Some historical reports claim that Claiborne tried to incite the natives against the Maryland colonists by telling them that the settlers at St. Mary 's were actually Spanish and enemies of the English , although this claim has never been proven . In 1635 , a Maryland commissioner named Thomas Cornwallis swept the Chesapeake for illegal traders and captured one of Claiborne 's pinnaces in the Pocomoke Sound . Claiborne tried to recover it by force , but was defeated ; although he retained his settlement on Kent Island . These were the first naval battles in North American waters , on 23 April and 10 May 1635 ; three Virginians were killed . 
 During these events , Governor John Harvey of Virginia , who had never been well liked by the Virginian colonists , had followed royal orders to support the Maryland settlement and , just before the naval battles in the Chesapeake , removed Claiborne from office as Secretary of State . In response , Claiborne 's supporters in the Virginia Assembly expelled Harvey from the colony . Two years later , an attorney for Cloberry and Company , who were concerned that the revenues they were receiving from fur trading had not recouped their original investment , arrived on Kent Island . The attorney took possession of the island and bade Claiborne return to England , where Cloberry and Company filed suit against him . The attorney then invited Maryland to take over the island by force , which it did in December 1637 . By March 1638 the Maryland Assembly had declared that all of Claiborne 's property within the colony now belonged to the proprietor . Maryland temporarily won the legal battle for Kent Island and won again when Claiborne 's final appeal was rejected by the Privy Council in April 1638 . 
 = = Parliamentary Commissioner and the second dispute with Maryland = = 
 In May 1638 , fresh from his defeat over Kent Island , Claiborne received a commission from the Providence Land Company , who were advised by his old friend Maurice Thomson , to create a new colony on <unk> Island off the coast of Honduras in the Caribbean Sea . At the time , Honduras itself was a part of Spain 's Kingdom of Guatemala , and Spanish settlements dominated the mainland of Central America . Claiborne optimistically called his new colony Rich Island , but Spanish power in the area was too strong and the colony was destroyed in 1642 . 
 Soon after , the chaos of the English Civil War gave Claiborne another opportunity to reclaim Kent Island . The Calverts , who had received such constant support from the King , in turn supported the monarchy during the early stages of the parliamentary crisis . Claiborne found a new ally in Richard Ingle , a pro @-@ Parliament Puritan merchant whose ships had been seized by the Catholic authorities in Maryland in response to a royal decree against Parliament . Claiborne and Ingle saw an opportunity for revenge using the Parliamentary dispute as political cover , and in 1644 Claiborne seized Kent Island while Ingle took over St. Mary 's . Both used religion as a tool to gain popular support , arguing that the Catholic Calverts could not be trusted . By 1646 , however , Governor Leonard Calvert had retaken both St. Mary 's and Kent Island with support from Governor Berkeley of Virginia , and , after Leonard Calvert died in 1648 , Cecil Calvert appointed a pro @-@ Parliament Protestant to take over as governor . The rebellion and its religious overtones was one of the factors that led to passage of the landmark Maryland Toleration Act of 1649 , which declared religious tolerance for Catholics and Protestants in Maryland . 
 In 1648 a group of merchants in London applied to Parliament for revocation of the Maryland charter from the Calverts . This was rejected , but Claiborne received a final opportunity to reclaim Kent Island when he was appointed by the Puritan @-@ controlled Parliament to a commission which was charged with suppressing Anglican disquiet in Virginia ; Virginia in this case defined as " all the plantations in the Bay of the Chesapeake . " Claiborne and fellow commissioner Richard Bennett secured the peaceful submission of Virginia to Parliamentary rule , and the new Virginia Assembly appointed Claiborne as Secretary of the colony . It also proposed to Parliament new acts which would give Virginia more autonomy from England , which would benefit Claiborne as he pressed his claims on Kent Island . He and Bennett then turned their attention to Maryland and , arguing again that the Catholic Calverts could not be trusted and that the charter gave the Calverts too much power , demanded that the colony submit to the Commonwealth . Governor Stone briefly refused but gave in to Claiborne and the Commission , and submitted Maryland to Parliamentary rule . 
 Claiborne made no overt legal attempts to re @-@ assert control over Kent Island during the commission 's rule of Maryland , although a treaty concluded during that time with the Susquehannocks claimed that Claiborne owned both Kent and Palmer Islands . Claiborne 's legal designs on Maryland were once again defeated when Oliver Cromwell returned Calvert to power in 1653 , after the Rump Parliament ended . In 1654 , Governor Stone of Maryland tried to reclaim authority for the proprietor and declared that Claiborne 's property and his life could be taken at the Governor 's pleasure . Stone 's declaration was ignored and Claiborne and Bennett again overthrew him , creating a new assembly in which Catholics were not allowed to serve . Calvert , now angry at Stone for what he perceived as weakness , demanded that Stone do something , and in 1655 Stone reclaimed control in St. Mary 's and led a group of soldiers to Providence ( modern Annapolis ) . Stone was captured and his force defeated by local Puritan settlers , who took control of the colony . Given the new situation , Claiborne and Bennett went to England in hopes of convincing Cromwell to change his mind but , to their dismay , no decision was made and , lacking royal authority , the Puritans gave power over to a new governor appointed by Calvert . Going behind Claiborne 's back , Bennett and another commissioner reached an agreement with Calvert that virtually guaranteed his continued control over Maryland through the remainder of the Protectorate . 
 With no authority left in Maryland , Claiborne turned to his political offices in Virginia . However , he was a Puritan and an ally of Parliament during the English Civil War , and upon the restoration of the British monarchy in 1660 , he had few friends left in government . Claiborne therefore retired from political affairs in 1660 and spent the remainder of his life managing his 5 @,@ 000 acre ( 2 @,@ 023 hectare ) estate , " Romancoke " , near West Point on the Pamunkey River , dying there in about 1677 .

 In the midst of the political turmoil of the conflict over Kent Island , Claiborne married Elizabeth Butler of Essex , who would remain his wife at least through 1668 . Claiborne was also the forebear of a number of lines of American <unk> , and among his descendants are William C. C. Claiborne , first governor of Louisiana , fashion designer Liz Claiborne , Daniel Sullivan ( LtCol USMC ) , the late minister Jerry Falwell , and a number of political figures from Tennessee and Virginia . Descendants of the Claiborne family have formed a society to advance the genealogical study of Claiborne 's lineage . Also some descendants of Claiborne are the families of Wood , Rice , McFarland , Harris , Gooch , Church and Estes .

 Henri @-@ Georges Clouzot ( French pronunciation : ​ [ ɑ ̃ <unk> ʒɔʁʒ <unk> ] ; ( 1907 @-@ 08 @-@ 18 ) 18 August 1907 – 12 January 1977 ( 1977 @-@ 01 @-@ 12 ) ) was a French film director , screenwriter and producer . He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre , having directed The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques , which are critically recognized to be among the greatest films from the 1950s . Clouzot also directed documentary films , including The Mystery of Picasso , which was declared a national treasure by the government of France . 
 Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and , desiring a career as a writer , moved to Paris . He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin , writing French @-@ language versions of German films . After being fired from German studios due to his friendship with Jewish producers , Clouzot returned to France , where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis . Upon recovering , Clouzot found work in Nazi occupied France as a screenwriter for the German @-@ owned company Continental Films . At Continental , Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular in France . His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release . As a result of his association with Continental , Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947 . 
 After the ban was lifted , Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orfèvres . After the release of his comedy film Miquette et sa mère , Clouzot married Véra Gibson @-@ Amado , who would star in his next three feature films . In the early and mid @-@ 1950s , Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques . Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later . After the release of La Vérité , Clouzot 's wife Véra died of a heart attack and Clouzot 's career suffered due to depression , illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave . Clouzot 's career became less active in later years , limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s . Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977 .

 Henri @-@ Georges Clouzot was born in Niort , France , to mother Suzanne Clouzot and father Georges <unk> , a book store owner . He was the first of three children in a middle @-@ class family . Clouzot showed talent by writing plays and playing piano recitals . In 1922 , Clouzot 's father 's bookstore went bankrupt and his family moved to Brest , France , where his father became an auctioneer . In Brest , Henri @-@ Georges Clouzot went to Naval School , but was unable to become a Naval Cadet due to his myopia . At the age of 18 , Clouzot left for Paris to study political science . While living in Paris , he became friends with several magazine editors . His writing talents led him to theater and cinema as a playwright , lyricist and adaptor @-@ screenwriter . The quality of his work led producer Adolphe Osso to hire him and send him to Germany to work in Studio Babelsberg in Berlin , translating scripts for foreign language films shot there .

 = = = = Screenwriting career ( 1931 – 1942 ) = = = = 
 Throughout the 1930s , Clouzot worked by writing and translating scripts , dialogue and occasionally lyrics for over twenty films . While living in Germany , Clouzot saw the films of F. W. Murnau and Fritz Lang and was deeply influenced by their expressionist style . In 1931 , he made his first short film , La <unk> des Batignolles , from a script by Jacques de Baroncelli . The film is a 15 @-@ minute comedy with three actors . Film historian and critic Claude <unk> reported this short was " surprisingly well made with expressive use of shadows and lighting contrasts that Clouzot would exploit on the full @-@ length features he would make years later " . Clouzot 's later wife , Inès de Gonzalez , said in 2004 that La <unk> des Batignolles added nothing to Clouzot 's reputation . In Berlin , Clouzot saw several parades for Adolf Hitler and was shocked at how oblivious he felt France was to what was happening in Germany . In 1934 , Clouzot was fired from UFA Studios for his friendship with Jewish film producers such as Adolphe Osso and Pierre <unk> . 
 In 1935 , Clouzot was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was sent first to Haute @-@ Savoie and then to Switzerland , where he was bedridden for nearly five years in all . Clouzot 's time in the sanatorium would be very influential on his career . While bedridden , Clouzot read constantly and learned the mechanics of storytelling to help improve his scripts . Clouzot also studied the fragile nature of the other people in the sanatorium . Clouzot had little money during this period , and was provided with financial and moral support by his family and friends . By the time Clouzot left the sanatorium and returned to Paris , World War II had broken out . French cinema had changed because many of the producers he had known had fled France to escape Nazism . 
 Clouzot 's health problems kept him from military service . In 1939 , he met actor Pierre Fresnay , who was already an established film star in France . Clouzot wrote the script for Fresnay 's only directorial feature Le Duel , as well as two plays for him : On <unk> les <unk> , which was performed in December 1940 , and Comédie en trois actes , which was performed in 1942 . Despite writing scripts for films and plays , Clouzot was so poor that he resorted to trying to sell lyrics to French singer Édith Piaf , who declined to purchase them . After France was invaded by Germany and subsequently during the German occupation of France during World War II , the German @-@ operated film production company Continental Films was established in France in October 1940 . Alfred Grevin , the director of Continental , knew Clouzot from Berlin and offered him work to adapt stories of writer Stanislas @-@ André Steeman . Clouzot felt uncomfortable working for the Germans , but was in desperate need of money and could not refuse Grevin 's offer . Clouzot 's first film for Continental was the adaptation of Steeman 's mystery novel Six hommes mort ( Six Dead Men ) . Clouzot retitled the film Le Dernier des six , having been influenced by actress Suzy Delair while writing the script , allowing her to choose the name of the character she would play . 
 = = = = Early directorial work ( 1942 – 1947 ) = = = = 
 After the success of Le Dernier de six , Clouzot was hired as the head of Continental 's screenwriting division . Clouzot began work on his second Steeman adaptation , which he would also direct , titled The Murderer Lives at Number 21 . It starred Fresnay and Delair playing the same roles they had performed in Le Dernier de six . Released in 1942 , the film was popular with audiences and critics . Clouzot 's next film was Le Corbeau based on a true story about a woman who sent poison pen letters in France in 1922 . Grevin was against Clouzot making this film , stating that topic was " dangerous " . Le Corbeau would be the last film that Fresnay and Clouzot would work together on . Clouzot had used all possible means to try to anger the actor during the filming , and after he quarreled with Fresnay 's wife , Yvonne Printemps , Fresnay and Clouzot broke off their <unk> Corbeau was a great success in France , with nearly 250 @,@ 000 people having seen it in the first months of its initial release . Le Corbeau was released in 1943 and generated controversy from the right @-@ wing Vichy regime , the left @-@ wing Resistance press and the Catholic Church . The Catholic Church considered the film " painful and hard , constantly morbid in its complexity " . The Vichy press dubbed it the antithesis of the Révolution nationale and demanded it be banned due to its immoral values . The anti @-@ Nazi resistance press considered it Nazi propaganda because of its negative portrayal of the French populace . Two days before the release of Le Corbeau , Continental films fired Clouzot . 
 After the liberation of France , Clouzot and several other directors were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans . For his sentence , Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film camera for the rest of his life . Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau , René Clair , Marcel Carné and Jean @-@ Paul Sartre , who were against the ruling . Clouzot 's sentence was later shortened from life to two years . There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal . During his two @-@ year banishment from filming , Clouzot worked with one of his supporters , Jean @-@ Paul Sartre , who had been one of the first people to defend Le Corbeau . 
 = = = = Return to filmmaking and acclaim ( 1947 – 1960 ) = = = = 
 After Clouzot 's ban was lifted , he reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with films such as Quai des Orfèvres and Manon . For Quai des Orfèvres , Clouzot asked the author Stanislas @-@ André Steeman for a copy of his novel , <unk> défense , to adapt into a film . Clouzot started writing the script before the novel arrived for him to read . Quai des Orfèvres was released in 1947 and was the fourth most popular film in France , drawing 5 @.@ 5 million spectators in that year . Clouzot directed and wrote two films that were released in 1949 . For Manon , he wanted to cast unknown actors . He scoured schools to find an actress for the lead role , and chose 17 @-@ year @-@ old Cécile Aubry after viewing over 700 girls . Manon was released in 1948 and was watched by 3 @.@ 4 million filmgoers in France as well as winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival . Clouzot directed and wrote the short film Le Retour de Jean , which was part of anthology film Return to Life . Le Retour de Jean was influenced by the short period when Clouzot lived in Germany in the early 1930s and stars Louis Jouvet as a survivor of a concentration camp who finds a wounded Nazi war criminal whom he interrogates and tortures . Clouzot 's next film was the comedy Miquette et Sa Mère , which was a financial failure . During the film 's production , Clouzot met Véra Gibson @-@ Amado , whom he married on 15 January 1950 . Clouzot and Véra took a film crew with them to Véra 's homeland in Brazil for their honeymoon , where Clouzot made his first attempt at directing a documentary film . The Brazilian government took issue with Clouzot filming the poverty of people in the favelas rather than the more picturesque parts of Brazil . The film was never finished because the costs became too high . Clouzot became fascinated with the region and wrote a book , Le cheval des dieux , recounting his trip . 
 Upon returning to France , he was offered a script written by Georges @-@ Jean Arnaud , an expatriate living in South America who had written about his own experiences there . Clouzot found it easy to imagine the setting of the script and was very anxious to film Arnaud 's story . He started writing the film , The Wages of Fear , with his brother , Jean Clouzot , who would collaborate with him on all his subsequent films under the name of Jérôme <unk> . Production on The Wages of Fear lasted from 1951 to 1952 . In order to gain as much independence as possible , Clouzot created his own production company called Véra Films , which he named after his wife . The sole female role in The Wages of Fear is played by Véra . Clouzot wrote the role specifically for his wife , as the character does not exist in the original novel . The Wages of Fear is about a South American town where a group of desperate men are offered money to drive trucks carrying nitroglycerin through rough terrain to put out an oil well fire . The Wages of Fear was the second most popular film in France in 1953 and was seen by nearly 7 million spectators . It won awards for Best Film and Best Actor ( for Charles <unk> ) at the Cannes Film Festival . Clouzot 's next big hit was Diabolique , whose screenplay he took away from director Alfred Hitchcock . Diabolique involves the story of a cruel headmaster who <unk> his wife and his mistress . The two women murder him and dump his body in a swimming pool , but when the pool is drained , no corpse is found . In 1954 , Diabolique won the Louis Delluc Prize and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best foreign film . In this early and mid @-@ 1950s period , with the films The Wages of Fear and Diabolique , Clouzot came to be fully embraced by international critics and audiences . Both films were screened and reviewed in America as well as in France , and were rated among the best thrillers of the decade . In 1955 , Clouzot directed the documentary The Mystery of Picasso , about the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso . The film follows Picasso drawing or painting 15 different works , all of which were intentionally destroyed following the film 's production . Clouzot and Picasso were old acquaintances , having met when Clouzot was 14 . The Mystery of Picasso won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival , but was a financial failure in France , being seen by only 37 @,@ 000 filmgoers during its initial run in 1956 . In 1984 , the film was declared a national treasure by the government of France . 
 Clouzot 's next feature film was Les Espions , which was released in 1957 . Les Espions featured actors from around the world including Véra Clouzot , Curd Jürgens , Sam Jaffe and Peter Ustinov . Les Espions would be the last acting role for Clouzot 's wife Véra , who had been suffering from severe heart problems since filming Diabolique . Les Espions is set in a rundown sanitarium that is taken over by international spies . One of the spies claims to have invented a nuclear explosive device which attracts the attention of the Russian and American <unk> . Les Espions was not released in the United States and was a financial failure in France . Clouzot later admitted that he only liked the first two @-@ thirds of Les Espions . Producer Raoul Levy suggested Clouzot 's next film should feature Brigitte Bardot as the lead actress . In response , Clouzot wrote the script for La Vérité . Bardot plays Dominique Marceau , who is on trial for the murder of her former boyfriend Gilbert Tellier . As her trial progresses , the relationship between Dominique and Gilbert becomes more finely shaped . Bardot later described La Vérité as her favorite of all the films she worked on . Released in 1960 , La Vérité was the second most popular film in France with 5 @.@ 7 million spectators and was Bardot 's highest grossing film . The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film .

 Although Clouzot 's reputation had grown internationally , he lost notability in French cinema due to rise of the French New Wave . The New Wave directors refused to take Clouzot 's thriller films seriously , and expressed their displeasure publicly through articles and reviews in the film criticism publication , Cahiers du cinéma . Clouzot took their criticism to heart , saying in the magazine Lui that he didn 't find his films Diabolique and Miquette et Sa Mère important or interesting anymore . The next film he worked on was L 'Enfer , which was never completed . The film examines the sexual jealousy of a man towards his flirtatious wife , whose psychological state deforms everything with desire . Lead actor Serge <unk> fell ill one week after shooting began and had to be replaced . Clouzot himself also became ill during production , which led doctors and insurance agents to order the production be stopped . Between 1965 and 1967 , Clouzot filmed for French television five documentaries of Herbert von Karajan conducting Verdi 's Requiem , Dvořák 's New World Symphony , Schumann 's 4th Symphony , Beethoven 's 5th Symphony and Mozart 's 5th Violin Concerto . After production finished on the documentaries , Clouzot was able to finance his final picture . 
 Clouzot 's return to work reassured the doctors and insurers and he returned to the film studio to make his final film La Prisonnière . The film began production in September 1967 and was halted when Clouzot fell ill and was hospitalized until April 1968 . He began filming La Prisonnière again in August 1968 . Clouzot incorporated stylistic elements of his aborted film L 'enfer into La Prisonnière . La Prisonnière is about a woman who is introduced to a photographer who takes masochistic submissive pictures of young women . The woman volunteers herself as a model for these pictures and is surprised at her own pleasure in the activity . After finishing La Prisonnière , Clouzot 's health grew worse . In the 1970s , he wrote a few more scripts without ever filming them , including a feature about Indochina . He also planned to direct a pornographic film in 1974 for Francis Micheline , but the film was abandoned . Clouzot 's health grew worse and he required open @-@ heart surgery in November 1976 . On 12 January 1977 Clouzot died in his apartment while listening to The Damnation of Faust . Clouzot is buried beside Véra in the Montmartre Cemetery . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 In the late @-@ 1930s , Clouzot went to a cabaret show featuring entertainers Mistinguett and Suzy Delair at the Deus Anes Cabaret . Clouzot waited for Delair at the stage door and after meeting her , the two became a romantic couple for the next 12 years . Clouzot had Delair star in two of his films , The Murderer Lives at Number 21 and Quai des Orfèvres . Delair eventually left Clouzot after working with him on Quai des Orfèvres . 
 Clouzot met his first wife Vera Clouzot through actor Léo Lapara , who had minor parts in Le Retour de Jean and Quai des Orfèvres . Véra met Clouzot after divorcing Lapara and while working as a continuity assistant on Clouzot 's Miquette et Sa Mère . Clouzot named his production company after Véra and had her star in all three films made by the company : The Wages of Fear , Diabolique and Les Espions . Véra also contributed to the script of La Vérité . Véra Clouzot died of a heart attack shortly after the filming of La Vérité . Clouzot fell into a depression over her death . After her funeral , he moved to Tahiti , but returned to France in December 1960 . 
 Clouzot met his second wife , Inès de Gonzalez , for the first time at a casting call for a film based on Vladimir Nabokov 's Laughter in the Dark . In 1962 , Clouzot met de Gonzalez again after she had returned from South America . In December 1963 , Clouzot and Inès de Gonzalez married . In the 1960s , Clouzot converted to Roman Catholicism . 
 = = Style = = 
 With the exception of the comedy film Miquette et sa mère , every directorial feature of Clouzot involves deception , betrayal and violent deaths . When basing screenplays on written work , Clouzot often changed the stories dramatically , using only key points of the original story . The author Stanislas @-@ André Steeman , whom Clouzot worked with twice , said Clouzot would only " build something after having contemptuously demolished any resemblance to the original , purely for the ambition of effect " . When writing for his own features , Clouzot created characters that were usually corrupt and spineless , with the capacity for both good and evil within them . 
 Clouzot was very demanding with his actors and would often quarrel with them to get them in the mood he desired . Suzy Delair recalled that Clouzot slapped her , but said of it , " So what ? He slapped others as well ... He was tough but I 'm not about to complain " . Pierre Fresnay recalled that Clouzot " worked relentlessly , which made for a juicy spectacle ... That 's to say nothing for his taste of violence , which he never tried with me " . When working with Bardot , one scene required Bardot 's character to drool and sleep . Clouzot offered her powerful sleeping pills , saying they were aspirin , and this led to Bardot 's stomach being pumped . Although Clouzot was harsh on his actors , he did not treat them fiercely off set . Delair recalled that off set there was an " innocence about him " that was not seen . 
 Clouzot biographer Marc Godin suggested Clouzot 's life provides clues to understanding his style as a filmmaker . Clouzot was viewed by many of his collaborators as a pessimist , short @-@ tempered , and almost always angry . Actress Brigitte Bardot described Clouzot as " a negative being , forever at odds with himself and the world around him " . Clouzot 's outlook on life is reflected in his own films that reveal the darker side of humanity . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Despite criticism following the arrival of the French New Wave , career retrospectives of Clouzot 's work have been positive . Twenty years after his death , film critic Noël <unk> wrote in the French film journal <unk> that " Les Diaboliques ( just like Les Espions and La Verite ) reveals a sterile and increasingly exaggerated urge to experiment with the powers of fiction " . Film historian Philipe <unk> wrote , " There is no doubt that if Clouzot had worked for Hollywood and applied the formulas of U.S. studios , today he would be lauded by the very critics who choose to ignore him " . Clouzot today is generally known for his thriller films The Wages of Fear and Diabolique . Clouzot 's ability in the genre led to comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock . Clouzot respected Hitchcock 's work , stating , " I admire him very much and am flattered when anyone compares a film of mine to his " . 
 Several of Clouzot 's films have been remade since their original releases . Director Otto Preminger adapted Le Corbeau into his 1951 film , The 13th Letter . In 1977 , the year of Clouzot 's death , William Friedkin directed a remake of The Wages of Fear called Sorcerer . French director Claude Chabrol adapted Clouzot 's script for L 'Enfer in 1994 also titled L 'Enfer . In 1996 , an American remake of Les Diaboliques was released under the title Diabolique , starring Sharon Stone .

 = Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar = 
 The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was a fifty @-@ cent piece struck intermittently by the United States Bureau of the Mint between 1926 and 1939 . The coin was designed by Laura Gardin Fraser and James Earle Fraser , and commemorates those who traveled the Oregon Trail and settled the Pacific Coast of the United States in the mid @-@ 19th century . Struck over a lengthy period in small numbers per year , the many varieties produced came to be considered a ripoff by coin collectors , and led to the end , for the time , of the commemorative coin series . 
 Ohio @-@ born Ezra Meeker had traveled the Trail with his family in 1852 and spent the final two decades of his long life before his death in 1928 publicizing the Oregon Trail , that it should not be forgotten . In 1926 , at age 95 , he appeared before a Senate committee , requesting that the government issue a commemorative coin that could be sold to raise money for markers to show where the Trail had been . The coin had originally been thought of by Idahoans , led by Dr. Minnie Howard , seeking to further preservation work at Fort Hall ; Meeker broadened the idea . Congress authorized six million half dollars , and placed no restriction on when or at what mint the coins would be struck . Meeker 's Oregon Trail Memorial Association ( OTMA ) had tens of thousands of pieces struck in 1926 and 1928 , and did not sell them all . Nevertheless , most years between 1933 and 1939 , it had small quantities of the half dollar coined , in some years from all three operating mints to produce mintmarked varieties , and raised prices considerably . 
 Collectors complained that some of the issues were controlled by coin dealers , and individual collectors had to pay high prices . Public protests followed , and in 1939 Congress ended the series . Despite the complaints , the OTMA had difficulty in selling the coins , and they remained available from the OTMA 's successor organization as late as 1953 . Just over 260 @,@ 000 of the 6 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 authorized coins were struck , of which about 60 @,@ 000 were melted . The US commemorative coin struck over the longest period , the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar has been widely praised for its design . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the middle years of the 19th century , before the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 made travel easier , hundreds of thousands of people journeyed along the Oregon Trail to settle the Far West of the United States . Not all who began the journey reached their destination as there was much suffering and death along the way — by one estimate , 20 @,@ 000 people lie in unmarked graves . 
 Ohio @-@ born farmer Ezra Meeker ( 1830 – 1928 ) traveled the Oregon Trail in 1852 ; he and his young wife and infant child went by ox @-@ drawn wagon from Iowa to Oregon Territory . In his old age , he came to believe that the Oregon Trail , and the sacrifice of those who had died along it , were being forgotten . Amid considerable publicity as one of the last survivors of the pioneers who had blazed the way west , Meeker retraced his route along the Trail between 1906 and 1908 . The Trail had in some places disappeared , swallowed up by town and farm , and in his journeys , he sought to find where he had passed , seeking to have historical markers erected . He took his ox team and wagon across the nation to publicize his cause , parking his rig in front of the White House where he met President Theodore Roosevelt . In New York , he crossed the Brooklyn Bridge . In 1910 , he and his oxen participated in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena . In the succeeding years , he traveled the route by oxcart , automobile , and , at age 93 in 1924 , airplane , attempting to further his cause , and seeking federal recognition and funding for his efforts . 
 = = Inception = = 
 The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar stemmed from various efforts by Idahoans who favored the preservation of the site of Fort Hall , an important way station on the Trail . The idea was sparked by the issuance of the 1925 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar , which caused Mabel Murphy , wife of an Idaho newspaperman , to propose to her husband the striking of an Oregon Trail coin , the profits from which could be used for historic preservation . Her husband , D.T. Murphy , on April 16 , 1925 dutifully published an editorial , " Oregon Trail Covered Wagon Half Dollars " in the Idaho State Journal . Mrs. Murphy would not live to see the coin issued , dying November 30 , 1925 of tuberculosis . 
 The idea for the coin was brought up again when civic activists in Pocatello , Idaho , led by Dr. Minnie Howard , sought ideas for funding a monument on the site of Fort Hall . Insurance salesman F.C. McGowan displayed a Stone Mountain piece , " Yes . Coinage . Like this ! " Howard and her colleagues pursued the idea . Meeker did as well once he heard of it , forming the Oregon Trail Memorial Association , ( " OTMA " or " the Association " ) a national organization , which could also receive the half dollars , and sell them at a profit . 
 By 1925 , Congress was reluctant to authorize more commemorative coins ; twelve pieces had been issued between 1920 and 1925 , and many legislators felt that coins were being allowed that " commemorate [ d ] events of local and not national interest " . The entire mintages of commemoratives were sold at face value to the sponsoring organizations designated in the authorizing acts . These groups then sold the coins to the public at a premium , thus raising money for causes that Congress had deemed worthy . Made cautious by a series of unsuccessful issues , Congress rejected a number of proposals for special coins in early 1926 . Among these were pieces to honor the completion of the Lincoln and Victory Highways , and a proposal to commemorate the centennial of the birth of American composer Stephen Foster . 
 The bill authorizing the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was first introduced in the House of Representatives on January 25 , 1926 by Washington Congressman John Franklin Miller , who had previously been mayor of Seattle . Meeker was living in Seattle while Miller was mayor , having moved from his previous home in Puyallup . According to local historian Bert Webber in his 1986 monograph on the coin , " there is little doubt that Mr. Miller was influenced to propose this coin by Ezra Meeker . " A hearing was held before the House Coinage Committee on March 3 ; Meeker testified . The bill was reported favorably , and then passed by the full House on April 5 , 1926 . The bill was not opposed in the House of Representatives , though one member , Michigan Congressman Louis Cramton , asked several questions before it passed by unanimous consent . According to an October 2013 article in The Numismatist , " Congress was no match for Meeker " . 
 On April 26 , 1926 , the 95 @-@ year @-@ old Meeker appeared before the Senate ’ s Committee on Banking and Currency . Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon had filed a letter opposing commemorative coin issues , except those of national importance . Meeker , in his testimony , argued that the Trail issue would be of such importance . The OTMA board considered whether to seek amendment of the bill to the alternative suggested by Mellon , a commemorative medal . In part because of Howard 's urging , they decided to stay with the coin . The bill for the half dollar was reported without recommendation , but was passed by the Senate on May 10 . Meeker met with President Calvin Coolidge to ensure it would be signed , which it was on May 17 , 1926 as Public Law 325 , authorizing the issuance of up to 6 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 half dollars . President Calvin Coolidge signed the bill on the White House lawn ; Meeker was present at the signing ceremony and was photographed shaking hands with President Coolidge . 
 The bill required that the Association pay for the half dollars at par , and that the dies and other costs of preparation not be at the expense of the United States . The figure of six million was the largest in American commemorative history , exceeding the five million for the Stone Mountain issue . Congress placed no restriction on which mint should strike the coins , and did not put a time limit on the authorization . According to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen in their encyclopedia of US commemoratives , the bill passed " possibly because the stated purpose was nationalistic rather than obscurely local " . Coin dealer and author Q. David Bowers states that " on the surface the motivation seemed to be good enough ... doubtless many American citizens had family ties to the famous migration " .

 Meeker wanted the new half dollars struck as quickly as possible ; he was planning another journey west on the Trail , and wanted to be able to sell the coins along the way . The Association initially contacted Chester Beach , credited with the design of the 1923 Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar , to sculpt the new coin , but he was unavailable , though he prepared sketches . 
 The OTMA tried to reach agreement with Gutzon Borglum , designer of the Stone Mountain piece , but he wanted too much money and time . Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar , who had played a minor role in the Columbian half dollar of 1892 – 93 , was willing , but lacked the national reputation the Association felt the coin 's sculptor needed . After receiving suggestions from the American Numismatic Society , the Association turned to the husband @-@ and @-@ wife team of James Earle Fraser and Laura Gardin Fraser . James Fraser had designed the Buffalo nickel ; Laura Gardin Fraser had created several commemorative coins , including the Grant Centennial dollar and half dollar . It chose the Frasers at the urging of Minnie Howard , who felt that James Fraser 's work dealt with the West , and might make manifest , in his coin design , the importance of the migration by covered wagon . The Association determined upon a design concept of a map showing the Oregon Trail on one side , and on the other a man leading an ox @-@ drawn wagon , with his wife and infant child riding . Although he is not formally commemorated by the coin , the man was meant to be Meeker . 
 = = Design = = 
 James Fraser designed the wagon side while Laura Fraser designed the Indian side and converted both into relief models . Meeker pestered Laura Fraser to complete the modeling , as he wanted the half dollars available for sale at an upcoming event . She completed the work by July 30 , 1926 , when she wrote to enquire where she should send the designs for endorsement by the Commission of Fine Arts . This body since 1921 had been tasked with advising the Secretary of the Treasury on coinage design . She sent photographs of her models to the commission 's offices . On August 5 , 1926 , commission chairman Charles Moore responded enthusiastically , informing her that not only had the commission endorsed the designs , but they were having the prints framed for their meeting room . To save time , the hubs from which coinage dies could be prepared were made by the Medallic Art Company of New York , which had made reductions from plaster models to hubs for several commemorative issues . The resulting hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint , where working dies for the issue were made . A compass rose on the Indian side , included in Laura Fraser 's models , does not appear on the issued coin , though the reason for the change is not known . 
 The wagon side designed by James Fraser depicts a Conestoga wagon drawn by two oxen , heading into an extremely large setting sun , with resplendent rays . The designers ’ initials appear behind the wagon ; five stars appear below the vehicle , though what they represent is uncertain . Swiatek and Breen suggested that they represent five states and territories through which pioneers would have passed . 
 The Indian side designed by Laura Fraser features a dramatically rendered Native American , standing erect with outstretched arm in what Vermeule describes as a gesture of peace . The Indian was added by the Frasers to the original map design concept endorsed by the OTMA . Swiatek and Breen noted that the Indian 's " position has been irreverently compared to that of a traffic policeman demanding ' Halt ! ' " Such statements were made from the time of issue ; The Numismatist in November 1926 stated that the Indian 's left hand " is upraised as if warning the people of the East of the perils and hardship of the Trail " . Meeker 's 1928 obituary in The New York Times averred that the Indian was " standing with hands upraised to stop the white man 's progress westward " . The Native American wears a headdress , has a blanket and bow , and is superimposed on a map of the United States , with a line of Conestoga wagons heading west . The design is carried to the rim of the coin ; Hudson Bay is visible in the upper right . 
 The Frasers ' design for the half dollar has been widely admired . Swiatek and Breen deemed the issue " one of the greatest artistic triumphs ever to be released by the Mint " . Numismatic historian Don Taxay called the coin " the most beautiful as well as the most truly ' American ' U.S. coin . It testifies to the fact that authentic genius , even when <unk> by the necessities of a modern , mechanical mint , can transform our coinage into a work of art . "

 According to Webber , " during the final stages of manufacture , [ Meeker ] kept heckling the mint to ' hurry up ' " . The Philadelphia Mint struck 48 @,@ 000 pieces in September 1926 , plus 30 reserved for inspection by the 1927 United States Assay Commission . Meeker peddled them along his route at $ 1 each . The difference between the face value and the sale price was to pay the cost for historical markers along the Trail , and to renovate the Whitman Mission in Washington state . The 1926 piece was later dubbed by the Association the " Ezra Meeker Issue " . The first piece struck was presented to Meeker ; its whereabouts are not known , while the second , presented to Howard , rests in the Idaho State Historical Museum . 
 With the initial quantity committed ( 75 pieces were returned to the mint , most likely because they were damaged or <unk> ) , the Association requested that more pieces be produced . A hundred thousand were coined at the San Francisco Mint in October and November , bearing the mint mark S ( 1926 @-@ S ) . The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar thus became the first commemorative coin struck at multiple mints ; Bowers notes that this set " a precedent which would be expanded and abused in the years to come " . According to Swiatek and Breen , " the Association ... [ was ] expecting that the collectors who bought 1926 Philadelphia coins would turn out in similar or greater numbers for the second variety " . Although a few thousand quickly sold , the market for the half dollars proved saturated , and tens of thousands remained at the mint pending payment . On December 29 , 1926 , Meeker celebrated his 96th birthday in New York ; he was presented with 96 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars by the Association . 
 Despite the many unsold 1926 @-@ S half dollars still in the government 's hands , the Association sought the issuance of 1927 @-@ dated half dollars ; this was refused by the Treasury Department ( of which the Bureau of the Mint was a part ) due to the backlog . In 1928 , 50 @,@ 000 more were struck at the Philadelphia Mint . Meeker continued his exploits : he was presented with 97 coins on his birthday in December 1927 by the Association and brought his half dollars to the visitor 's gallery of the New York Stock Exchange , though he was refused permission to go onto the floor . In April 1928 , Meeker wrote to the American Numismatic Association , urging its coin @-@ collecting members to purchase both the 1926 and 1926 @-@ S pieces . Nevertheless , although Meeker organized a national campaign to sell the coins , the OTMA lost $ 10 @,@ 000 by his efforts , due to office and other expenses . " The aged pioneer did not appear to be that good with money " . 
 Meeker was given a truck chassis and money to modify it into a wagon @-@ topped vehicle by Henry Ford in 1928 for yet another Trail trip . Ford offered to make the vehicle more comfortable for Meeker if he brought it to the Ford factory in Dearborn , Michigan . Accordingly , when he left New York in August 1928 on another journey , planning to sell half dollars along the way , he headed directly for Michigan . He arrived ill , and was hospitalized , almost dying there . He was able to return home , disgruntled at having missed voting in the election ( he supported the successful Republican candidate , Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover , for president ) for the first time since 1853 . At his home in Washington state , Meeker again became ill in November , and died December 3 , 1928 , three and a half weeks before his 98th birthday . He was buried in a cemetery in Puyallup , a place he had helped settle . Meeker 's headstone bears a plaque reproducing the wagon side of the half dollar .

 After Meeker 's death , the OTMA selected Howard R. Driggs , a professor of English education at New York University as his successor , and elected a new board of directors , which worked to clear the debt Meeker had accrued . Coins on hand continued to be sold . It was able to persuade President Hoover to proclaim the Covered Wagon Centennial in 1930 , the hundredth anniversary both of Meeker 's birth and of the first wagon train leaving St. Louis for the Oregon country . One means of selling coins the Association devised was a campus @-@ wide drive at Yale University , alma mater of Association executive director Lorne W. Buckley , in October 1930 to raise money for Trail markers . More than 600 coins were sold . 
 Most 1928 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars remained in the hands of the Treasury for several years after their striking , though the Association purchased an estimated 1 @,@ 000 for sale to the public . This impoundment by the government generated interest in the coin collecting community — several letters to the editor appeared in The Numismatist , enquiring as to the coins 's fate . One collector followed up with the Philadelphia Mint ; Acting Superintendent Fred H. Chaffin replied that the coins were being held there for the Association , and were dated 1928 . The OTMA had a financial crisis in 1931 , and was planning to close its doors , but operations continued , with headquarters moved from its Manhattan office to Driggs 's home in Bayside , Queens . The Association marketed the 1928 coins as the " Jedediah Smith Issue " . 
 In early 1933 , Driggs sought the issuance of more half dollars on behalf of the OTMA , writing to the acting Mint Director , Mary Margaret O <unk> and then to Treasury Secretary William H. Woodin . Driggs wanted 5 @,@ 000 of the 1928 and 5 @,@ 000 new half dollars struck at Denver ( 1933 @-@ D ) , proposing to exchange 10 @,@ 000 half dollars dated 1926 . All the coins held by the government , including those acquired by the exchange , were to be melted . This was approved , and the pieces were duly struck at the Denver Mint , the first commemorative coins ever struck at Denver . 
 The Association had turned to the Scott Stamp and Coin Company of New York to market the coins . Scott was able to sell some of the 1928 half dollars . These actions have been interpreted negatively by numismatic scholars : Q. David Bowers alleges that Scott 's representative , Wayte Raymond , proposed melting most of the issue to create an artificial scarcity , and that the company " desired to capitalize on the gullibility of collectors and their need to complete sets by having more varieties coined . Scott figured that if additional Oregon Trail half dollars could be minted with the date 1933 they could be sold effectively at the Century of Progress Exposition held that year in Chicago . " Swiatek and Breen noted , " through God only knows what manner of political manipulation , the Oregon Trail Memorial Association managed to obtain approval of a new 1933 Denver issue " for sale at the exposition . 
 A total of 5 @,@ 250 of the 1933 @-@ D were struck , of which approximately five were reserved for the Assay Commission and 242 were eventually returned for melting . Bowers believes that the returned pieces were likely defective , rather than unsold . The Association dubbed the 1933 @-@ D the " Century of Progress Exposition Issue " ; both the 1928 and the 1933 @-@ D half dollars were sold for $ 2 each . However , the 1928 could be obtained for $ 1 @.@ 75 by anyone who had recently bought two or more of the 1926 issues , and could be purchased for as little as $ 1 @.@ 10 each by purchasing 10 of the 1926 @-@ dated coins . 
 With the relative success of the 1933 @-@ D issue , the Association ordered 7 @,@ 000 more in 1934 , also struck at Denver . These were dubbed the " Fort Hall , Fort Laramie and Jason Lee Issue " and were also sold by Scott , for $ 2 . These also were not paid for by the OTMA , but were an exchange for 1926 @-@ S half dollars — the distribution figure of 83 @,@ 055 for the 1926 @-@ S equals 100 @,@ 000 for the OTMA plus 55 assay pieces minus 17 @,@ 000 returned in exchange for the 1933 @-@ D and 1934 @-@ D pieces . 
 The resurrected Oregon Trail issue became controversial in the collecting community , with a large number of coin clubs passing resolutions against the reissues ; the president of the American Numismatic Association called for commemorative coins to be sold only by the Mint , not by private organizations . Driggs protested against the resolutions , copies of which were sent to federal authorities . Nevertheless , the 1935 @-@ S pieces he had requested of the Mint , and dies for which were prepared , were never struck , perhaps because of the indignation of collectors . Other reasons have been postulated for the lack of an issue in 1935 : in a 1937 monograph quoted by Bowers , early coin dealer B. Max Mehl speculated that it took Scott two years to dispose of the 1934 @-@ D pieces . 
 = = = Final issues and termination = = = 
 Beginning in 1934 , organizations and individuals saw small @-@ mintage commemoratives , struck at multiple mints over the course of years , as an opportunity for profit . Congress authorized several issues in 1934 , including the Texas Centennial half dollar , meant to honor the centennial of Texas Independence in 1936 , but struck from 1934 to 1938 , after 1934 at all three mints each year . More new commemoratives followed in 1935 , and over 20 in 1936 . These issues included the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar , issued to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music , although nothing out of the ordinary is known to have taken place in that city 's musical life in 1886 . 
 Numismatist Arlie R. Slabaugh , in his volume on US commemorative coins , discussed the marketing practices of the 1930s : 
 Added to the abuse of reissues was the manner of selling these [ the Oregon Trail pieces ] and several other later issues of commemoratives . The price was often higher than the dollar per coin usually asked in the past , although most of the commemorative deluge came during the depression years . A few pieces at a higher price would not have been too bad , but on a large number of types , the cost to collectors added up . Then , too , many issues were sold only in sets . Coinage was generally small and sold out in only a few days . Speculation was rife — original cost was low to what it might be a short time later if you unfortunately missed having your order filled ... collectors who had not managed to obtain single specimens from the original source were forced to buy it at higher and higher prices from speculators — it soon became a regular round robin of higher and higher prices . 
 On December 30 , 1935 , Driggs wrote to O 'Reilly , who with the appointment of Nellie Tayloe Ross as Mint Director had resumed her position as Assistant Mint Director , seeking the issuance of 5 @,@ 000 Oregon Trail coins to be struck at San Francisco ( 1936 @-@ S ) to celebrate the centennial of the arrival of missionary Marcus Whitman and his wife in the Walla Walla Valley . O 'Reilly and other officials did not immediately answer and Driggs wrote again in March 1936 , Chaffin , again acting superintendent at Philadelphia , responded that the dies had been prepared and sent to San Francisco . The coins were sent at Driggs ' request to Scott 's in New York . In May , Driggs asked that 10 @,@ 000 more be struck at Philadelphia , and this was done . These were sold at the height of the commemorative coin boom . Some of the 1936 and 1936 @-@ S pieces were sold by Scott , others by the Association through a New York City mail drop , in either case at an initial price of $ 1 @.@ 60 per half dollar . Six each of the 1936 and 1936 @-@ S were struck in addition to the requested quantities , for assay . 
 In June 1936 , Herbert G. West , head of the Whitman Centennial Celebration , wrote to Driggs informing him that his group had sought and failed to gain ( unusually for 1936 ) a commemorative half dollar to finance its activities . West wanted Driggs to order a special issue of the Oregon Trail commemorative for the Whitman organization to sell . Driggs was non @-@ committal , first telling West that he hoped they might still be successful in gaining their own half dollar , and then that a special issue would be difficult to get as the mints had shut down for the summer . He eventually agreed to give the Whitman group a thousand 1936 @-@ S half dollars , on condition they not be sold for less than $ 1 @.@ 60 so as not to undercut the OTMA 's sales efforts . In fact , Driggs suggested a sale price of $ 2 , which was what the Whitman organization sold them for . These were dubbed the " Whitman Centennial Issue " , or the " Whitman Mission Issue " . Most of the 1936 pieces struck at Philadelphia were sold by the means of a mailing to Scott 's customer list . Some portion of each of the issues between 1933 and 1937 were reserved for sale by patriotic organizations . 
 The 1937 issue was distributed only by the Association as the deal with Scott had been ended . A total of 12 @,@ 000 pieces ( plus eight for the Assay Commission ) were struck at Denver , and were sold at $ 1 @.@ 60 . No special name was given to the issue . Coin dealer Mehl wondered in 1937 , " the 1936 Philadelphia Mint coin is now retailing at $ 5 and the San Francisco Mint at $ 10 . Where will this thing stop ? I don 't know . " 
 The 1938 coins , again without a special name , were struck at all three mints , the first time that had been done for the Oregon Trail coins in one year . Six thousand ( plus pieces for the Assay Commission ) were struck at each mint , and the issue was sold in sets of three , for $ 6 @.@ 25 . The same practice was followed in 1939 , but the price was raised to $ 7 @.@ 50 a set and the mintage reduced to 3 @,@ 000 coins , plus the assay pieces . According to Swiatek and Breen , these sets were also bought up by speculators , and individual collectors often had to pay double or triple the issue price to secure a set . The coins did not sell out instantly ; the OTMA 's accounting records reveal that nine months after the 1938 coins were put on sale , the organization still had almost half the issue available . Similarly , by October 1939 , the Association had sold only 8 @,@ 283 half dollars dated that year , less than the 9 @,@ 000 available for sale . Nevertheless , collectors sent letters of protest to congressmen and to the Treasury Department . On August 5 , 1939 , Congress acted , passing legislation that put an end to all commemorative issues authorized before March 1939 . Swiatek and Breen observed that if Congress had not intervened , " there would probably be Oregon Trail coins dated 1980 " . 
 A total of 264 @,@ 419 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars were struck , of which approximately 174 were intended for the Assay Commission , and 61 @,@ 317 were melted . Accordingly , a total of 202 @,@ 928 were issued to the public . The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was the commemorative coin struck for the longest period . According to R.S. Yeoman 's 2015 edition of A Guide Book of United States Coins , the cheapest Oregon Trail coins are the 1926 and 1926 @-@ S at $ 135 in Almost Uncirculated . The 1939 pieces are listed only as a set and in Mint State condition ( uncirculated ) , beginning at $ 1 @,@ 600 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Oregon Trail Memorial Association became part of the newly formed American Pioneer Trails Association ( APTA ) in 1940 , a group meant to be broader in scope than the OTMA . A 1942 joint financial statement of both organizations reveals that it still held 7 @,@ 212 half dollars . It was selling 1936 and 1937 @-@ D half dollars in 1943 . A letter to the editor in the September 1943 issue of The Numismatist stated that the group was selling the pieces at $ 5 to finance stakes made of Oregon wood with which to mark the Trail . The sum of five dollars , which included membership , paid for a coin at a time , the letter noted , when the pieces were selling at $ 1 @.@ 50 from dealers . 
 Minnie Howard was still in 1947 trying to secure the site of Fort Hall , and as part of that effort got Idaho Senator Henry <unk> to introduce legislation allowing the issuance of more Oregon Trail half dollars to benefit Howard 's Idaho organization . No sooner had he done so , on February 26 , than President Harry Truman announced his opposition to various coin bills that had been introduced . Acting Treasury Secretary E.F. Foley wrote in opposition , tracing the history between the OTMA and the Treasury Department , " Coins were ordered to be minted and left in the mints " . The Banking Committee opposed the bill , and it failed . According to a November 2014 article in The Numismatist , " With the efforts in the 1940s , the Oregon Trail half dollar , having seen its sunrise in Pocatello , met its sunset there as well . " 
 Driggs led the APTA until his death at age 89 in 1963 , but it became less active in his final years . He retained at least some half dollars , notifying the Mint in 1953 that the APTA was the successor to the OTMA , and still had half dollars for sale . After his death , over fifty Oregon Trail half dollars were found among his effects . Other groups have carried the APTA 's missions of Trail preservation and the building of monuments . In 1963 , two years before Howard 's death , the City of Pocatello erected a replica of Fort Hall in a park . The actual site , however , remains undeveloped , with an inconspicuous marker . 
 No commemorative coins were struck between 1939 and 1945 . When authorizations resumed after the war , issues in honor of Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver were sold , in some years , in low @-@ mintage sets of coins from all three mints . After 1954 , when the last such pieces were struck , the Treasury Department did not again support a non @-@ circulating commemorative until 1982 , when a half dollar in honor of the 250th anniversary of the birth of George Washington was issued . The Washington half dollar was distributed by the Mint , with profits applied to the reduction of the national debt . Bowers writes , " this time around [ , striking of commemorative coins ] would not be on behalf of private or local interests " . 
 In the past , numismatic writers have described the Association and its activities harshly . Bowers states that the Oregon Trail coins " are beautiful , but circumstances surrounding their issuance leave much to be desired " . Slabaugh noted that " Artistically , this is my favorite commemorative coin . But from an ethical standpoint , it is not . " Swiatek and Breen wrote that the Association 's " activities in exploiting coin collectors and the general public eventually led to the unpopularity of commemoratives in Congress and ultimately to adamant Treasury Department opposition to any further commemorative issues , no matter how worthy the cause to be memorialized , no matter who represented the sponsoring commissions " . According to Bowers , " as far as I know , the financial benefits which provided the reason for issuing the half dollars , ' to rescue the various important points along the old trail from oblivion , ' to erect ' suitable monuments , memorial and otherwise , ' etc . , never came to pass , at least not from money provided by the sale of the coins . " These , however , did not have the benefit of examining OTMA records . Following the opening of Driggs 's papers for research at Southern Utah University , an October 2013 article in The Numismatist concluded that though many documents , such as the arrangements with Scott 's , are missing from his records , what there is " seems consistent with Driggs wanting to use the coins to finance the marking of the Oregon Trail , not to line his own pockets " .

 A small number of coins from each year and mint were put aside for inspection by the following year 's Assay Commission , the above figures include such pieces . This accounts for the variance from the even thousand mintages in 1933 and after . 
 = Battle of Sangju ( 1950 ) = 
 The Battle of Sangju ( Korean : <unk> 전투 ) was an engagement between the United Nations and North Korean forces , occurring on July 20 – 31 , 1950 , in the village of Sangju in southern South Korea , early in the Korean War . It ended in a victory for the North Korean forces after they were able to push troops of the United States and South Korea out of the area . 
 Republic of Korea Army units had been unsuccessfully resisting advances by the North Korean People 's Army in the region when they were reinforced by the United States Army 's 25th Infantry Division , newly arrived in the country . In the subsequent fight , the 25th Infantry Division was able to inflict substantial casualties on the advancing NK 15th Division but was not able to hold its positions . In 11 days of fighting , the UN forces performed poorly and were forced to withdraw from Yechon County , the city of Sangju , and the surrounding areas . 
 The US 24th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division was ineffective in its first showing . The regiment , composed mostly of black troops , was criticized by the Army for being quick to panic and retreat . Some historians have described the Army 's statements as biased , downplaying the regiment 's successes and overstating its failures . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 Following the invasion of the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) by its northern neighbor , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) , the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict in support of South Korea . The United States subsequently sent ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing . However , US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II in 1945 , and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army , which was headquartered in Japan . The division was understrength , and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending . Regardless , the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea . 
 The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial " shock " of North Korean advances , fighting alone and outnumbered for several weeks . They delayed much larger North Korean units while additional UN forces arrived and moved into position : the 7th Infantry Division , 25th Infantry Division , 1st Cavalry Division , and other Eighth Army supporting units . South Korean forces in the meantime were systematically defeated and forced south along Korea 's east coast , with entire divisions being overrun by the North Koreans ' superior firepower and equipment . Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 , during the first battle between American and North Korean forces . For the first month after the defeat at Osan , 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force 's superior numbers and equipment . The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south in battles around Chochiwon , Chonan , and Pyongtaek . The 24th Infantry Division made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon , being almost completely destroyed but delaying North Korean forces from advancing until July 20 . By that time , the Eighth Army 's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region at around 70 @,@ 000 for each side , with new UN units arriving every day . 
 = = = US 25th Infantry Division arrives = = = 
 At the same time , on the east coast , the NK 12th Division was resting from its heavy battles north of the town of Sangju , a crossroads center for all the mountain roads in that part of Korea . Situated south of the Mun 'gyong plateau and the dividing watershed between the Han River and the Naktong River , Sangju had a commanding position in the valley of the Naktong , 45 miles ( 72 km ) northeast of Taegu . There was a large amount of confused activity around Sangju during the end of July , as refugees and stragglers from the defeated ROK Army poured south through the town . Many ROK units were retreating to Sangju and some had passed south through it . Isolated fighting had already begun between North Koreans and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) forces for control of the Mun 'gyong plateau when the US 25th Infantry Division under Major General William B. Kean , newly arrived in Korea on July 10 – 15 , received orders from General Walker to concentrate there to bolster ROK defenses of the central mountain corridors . Eighth Army Commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker looked to the 25th Division to help the ROK forces in central Korea prevent a major North Korean movement into the valley of the upper Naktong . The division stood at a strength of 13 @,@ 059 as of July 19 .

 = = = Capture of Yechon = = = 
 The first action between elements of the 25th Division and North Korean forces took place at Yechon on July 20 . Company K , 3rd Battalion , US 24th Infantry Regiment , led by First Lieutenant Jasper R. Johnson , entered the town during the afternoon . When other units of the 3rd Battalion failed to take a ridge overlooking the town on the left , he requested and received permission to withdraw from the town for the night . 
 Meeting at the battalion command post , the commanders of the US units planned a renewed assault for 05 : 00 the next morning . Artillery and mortars fired on the town ahead of the infantry advance , and soon the town was on fire from the shells . By this time , however , Yechon had likely been abandoned by the North Koreans . At Hamch 'ang , Colonel Henry G. Fisher , commanding the US 35th Infantry Regiment , received an erroneous message early that morning stating that the North Koreans had driven the 24th Infantry from Yechon . He immediately left for Yechon . He found the battalion commander about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) west of the town , but was dissatisfied with the information that he received from him . Fisher and a small party then drove on into Yechon , which was still burning . He encountered no North Korean troops or South Korean civilians . The 3rd Platoon , 77th Engineer Combat Company , attached to Company K , entered the town with the infantrymen and attempted to halt the spread of flames but were unable to do so because of high , shifting winds . The 24th Infantry then met light resistance from North Korean troops counterattacking the town , but drove them off , securing the town after several hours of fighting at a cost of 2 killed and 12 wounded . North Korean casualties at the fight could not be estimated . However , the US Army , preoccupied by the Battle of Taejon , took little notice and credited the victory to the South Koreans . News of the capture was picked up by the US media as the first fight won by black soldiers of the mostly black unit . By 13 : 00 Yechon was secured , and 3rd Battalion turned over control of the town to the ROK 18th Regiment of the ROK Capital Division . The Capital Division then concentrated the bulk of its forces there , and opposed the NK 8th Division in that vicinity the remainder of the month . 
 = = = Drawing battle lines = = = 
 Major General Kean and his 25th Division had to guard two main approaches to Sangju to keep the town from falling to the North Koreans . The main road crossed the Mun 'gyong plateau and passed through Hamch 'ang at the base of the plateau about 15 miles ( 24 km ) north of Sangju . Next , there was a secondary mountain road that crossed the plateau farther west and , once through the mountains , turned east toward Sangju . 
 On the main road , the 2nd Battalion , 35th Infantry , held a blocking position northwest of Hamch 'ang , supported by a platoon of tanks from A Company , 78th Tank Battalion , and A Battery , 90th Field Artillery Battalion . The 1st Battalion was emplaced with the 2nd Battalion but stayed less than 24 hours before it was sent to reinforce the US 27th Infantry Regiment on the next north @-@ south line of communications westward . Thus , in effect , one battalion of US troops stood behind ROK units on the Hamch 'ang approach . On the second road , that leading into Sangju from the west , the 24th Infantry Regiment assembled two , and later all three , of its battalions . 
 The 2nd Battalion of the 35th Infantry took up a hill position northwest of Hamch 'ang and south of Mun 'gyong on the south side of a stream that flowed past Sangju to the Naktong . On the north side of the stream an ROK battalion held the front line . Brigadier General <unk> Wilson , the 25th 's Assistant Division Commander , ordered F Company of the battalion to be inserted in the center of the ROK line north of the stream , and this was done over the strong protests of the battalion commander , Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins . Wilson thought the American troops would strengthen the ROK defense but Wilkins did not want the untried company to be dependent on ROK stability in its first engagement . Behind the ROK and F Company positions the ground rose to another hill within small arms range . Heavy rains had swollen the stream behind the ROK and F Company positions to a torrent that was rolling large boulders along its channel . In the meantime , the ROK 2nd Battalion , 17th Regiment , ambushed a battalion of North Korean troops near <unk> , forcing it to withdraw . 
 = = = North Korean attack on Sangju = = = 
 On July 22 the North Koreans attacked . The ROK troops resisted briefly , but withdrew from their positions on either side of F Company without communicating their intentions . The withdrawal had been a part of the plan for reorganizing the line to incorporate the US troops , but F Company expected them to send a message before doing so , and did not adjust their defenses to compensate . North Korean troops quickly flanked F Company and began attacking it from the rear . This precipitated an unorganized withdrawal . The swollen stream prevented F Company from crossing to the south side and the 2nd Battalion positions . Walking wounded crowded along the stream where an effort to get them across failed . Two officers and two noncommissioned officers tied a pair of twisted telephone wires about their bodies and tried to swim to the other bank and fasten a line , but each in turn was swept downstream where they floundered ashore on the same bank where they had started . Some men drowned trying to cross the swollen river . The covering fire of a platoon of tanks on the south side held off the North Koreans and allowed most of the survivors to eventually escape . F Company lost 37 men : 6 killed , 10 wounded , and 21 missing . 
 The next morning five North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks crossed the river and moved toward Hamch 'ang . Artillery fire from A Battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion knocked out four of the tanks immediately . The fifth moved back across the river , where an air strike later destroyed it .

 The 2nd Battalion , 35th Infantry , was still in its position when it received orders to withdraw to a point 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of Sangju on July 23 . On July 28 the battalion fell back 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) further , and the next day it moved to a position south of Sangju . On the last day of July , the 35th Infantry was ordered to a blocking position on a line of hills 8 miles ( 13 km ) south of Sangju on the Kumch 'on road . In 11 days it had fallen back about 30 miles ( 48 km ) on the Sangju front without encountering strong resistance , only North Korean patrols . During the battle , the 35th Infantry merely executed a series of withdrawals on division orders as the front around it collapsed , and was not heavily involved in the fighting . 
 The ROK 6th Division continued its hard @-@ fought action on the road through the mountains from Mun 'gyong , but gradually it fell back from in front of the NK 1st Division . In the mountains above Hamch 'ang the ROK 6th Division on July 24 destroyed seven North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks . Three days later the ROK 1st Division , now relieved northwest of Sangju by the US 24th Infantry and redeployed on the Hamch 'ang front , destroyed four more tanks there with 2 @.@ 36 @-@ inch bazookas and captured one tank intact . The remnants of the ROK 2nd Division , relieved by the 27th Infantry Regiment on the Hwanggan – Poun road , were incorporated into the ROK 1st Division . Thus , by July 24 the US 25th Division had taken over from the ROK 1st and 2nd Divisions the sector from Sangju westward to the Seoul – Taegu highway , and these ROK troops were moving into the line eastward and northward from Sangju on the Hamch 'ang front . 
 By July 27 all the Mun 'gyong divide was in North Korean possession and their units were moving into the valley of the upper Naktong in the vicinity of Hamch 'ang . Prisoners taken at the time and others captured later said that the NK 1st Division suffered 5 @,@ 000 casualties in the struggle for control of the divide , including the division commander who was wounded and replaced . The NK 13th Division , following the 1st , suffered about 500 casualties below Mun 'gyong , but otherwise it was not engaged during this period . The NK 15th Division , one of North Korea 's weaker divisions which consisted mostly of inexperienced youth , moved on Sangju . It was part of a concentrated attack by North Korean troops aiming to push the UN forces south before they had time to organize an effective defensive line . 
 Simultaneously with their appearance on the Hamch 'ang road at the southern base of the Mun 'gyong plateau north of Sangju , the North Koreans approached on the secondary mountain road to the west . On July 22 , F Company of the 35th Infantry was also attacked north of Hamch 'ang , when it was confronted with a North Korean battalion three times its size . The company fought effectively and inflicted heavy casualties , though the next day rains caused flooding of a river to the unit 's rear and cut off its route of supply . Assisted by artillery , it was able to disengage .

 Elements of the US 24th Infantry Regiment had a similar experience west of Sangju . On that day , the 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry , and elements of the ROK 17th Regiment were advancing into the mountains 20 miles ( 32 km ) northwest of the town . There , they came into contact with the NK 48th Regiment , 15th Division , the leading element of the North Korean troops . With E Company leading , 2nd Battalion moved along the dirt road into a gorge with precipitous mountain walls . Suddenly , a North Korean light mortar and one or two automatic weapons fired on E Company . It stopped and the men dispersed along the sides of the road . 
 Soon North Korean rifle fire came in on the dispersed men and E and F Companies immediately began withdrawing in a disorderly manner . Troops began shying from the front and retreating without orders , ignoring officers ' commands to stay in position . Colonel Horton V. White , the regimental commander , heard of the difficulty and drove hurriedly to the scene . He found the battalion coming back down the road in disorder and most of the men in a state of panic . Historians blame the retreat as much on officers ' ineptitude as individual soldiers panicking . He mustered the men and ordered a retreat but by then many soldiers were withdrawing on their own . The next day the ROK 17th Regiment enveloped the North Korean position that had launched the attack and captured two light machine guns , one mortar , and about 30 North Koreans who appeared to be guerrillas . The ROK 17th Regiment fought in the hills for the next two days , making some limited gains , and then it moved back to Sangju to join other units as part of the ROK Army reorganization in progress around Pusan . This left only the US 24th Infantry Regiment guarding the west approach to Sangju from the Mun 'gyong plateau . 
 The tendency to panic continued in nearly all the 24th Infantry operations west of Sangju . Men left their positions and straggled to the rear . They abandoned weapons on positions . On many occasions units lost most of their equipment while on the move , even when not under fire , causing logistical shortages . In other cases the majority of a unit would desert its position at the first sign of North Korean fire . 
 By July 26 all three battalions of the 24th Infantry were concentrated in remote battle positions that were difficult to resupply , astride the road 10 miles ( 16 km ) west of Sangju . The shortage of UN troops forced the regiment to devote most of its troops to the front , leaving very few reserves to respond to attacks . Elements of the NK 15th Division advancing on this road had cleared the mountain passes and were closing with the regiment . From July 26 to the end of the month the North Koreans had almost constant contact with the 24th Infantry , which was supported by the 159th and 64th Field Artillery Battalions and one battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion . The North Koreans relied heavily on massed charges to close rapidly on the US lines . This caused heavy casualties for the North Koreans , but their mortars and artillery inflicted significant casualties on the American lines in turn . 
 During the last days of July , the 24th Infantry generally tried to hold positions during the day , and then withdrew at night . Their performance was mixed ; during the first few North Korean attacks , most units held positions until they ran out of ammunition . Higher officers attempted to move the units back in position but were unsuccessful in the face of mounting North Korean resistance . Notably , L Company fought until surrounded by North Korean attackers ; the rest of the regiment was able to drive them off . 
 On July 29 the 1st Battalion suffered about 60 casualties from North Korean mortar fire . As the men were preparing their perimeter defense for the night , a general panic arose , for reasons that are still unclear . Most of them deserted their positions in a state of alarm . Colonel White found himself , the 77th Combat Engineer Company , and a battery of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion all that was left in the front line . He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men to listen to them . As White tried to rally his men , the field artillery maintained a sustained barrage of fire to slow the North Koreans advance . That night alone the artillery fired 3 @,@ 000 rounds in holding back the North Koreans . 
 = = = US withdrawal = = = 
 In the final days of the fight , to the west of Sangju , Major John R. Woolridge , one of the regiment 's senior officers , set up a check point west of the town and stopped every vehicle coming from the west , taking off stragglers attempting to retreat . Many jeeps were filled with six or seven men claiming they were retreating after their position was overrun . He averaged about 75 stragglers a day , and 150 on the last day of the battle . A contingent of military police were dispatched specifically to collect men abandoning their positions and to return them to the front . 
 By July 30 , the 24th Infantry had withdrawn to the last defensible high ground west of Sangju , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from the town . The North Korean troops hit the regiment with heavy attacks beginning at 05 : 00 that morning , targeting the 3rd Battalion 's forward positions . Overstretched , lacking reserves and plagued by stragglers , the regiment began to come apart and senior commanders had to personally move into the front lines to help resist the Korean advance with their sidearms . The regiment had deteriorated so badly by this time that General Kean recalled the 1st Battalion , 35th Infantry , and placed it in defensive positions behind the 24th Infantry , to hold the line when the 24th withdrew . The next day North Koreans again pressed against the regiment 's forward line of resistance . First Lieutenant Leon A. Gilbert , commanding A Company , and about 15 men then quit the forward line . White and other ranking officers ordered Gilbert back into position , but he refused to go , saying that he was scared . The senior noncommissioned officer returned to the forward position with the men . After regimental commanders pleaded unsuccessfully with Gilbert to return to his position , he was arrested and tried for desertion under fire , a capital offense , and sentenced to death . His sentence was later reduced to 17 years in prison , but he served only five of them . 
 Finally , during the night of July 31 the 24th Infantry Regiment withdrew through Sangju . The 1st Battalion , 35th Infantry , covered the withdrawal . The NK 15th Division set up a new defensive line at Sangju the next day as the 25th Infantry Division was moved to deal with a growing attack on Masan to the south . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In 11 days of action in the Sangju area the 24th Regiment had suffered 323 battle casualties , 27 killed , 293 wounded , and 3 missing . The light casualty count was partially credited to effective use of fortifications and North Korean caution in advancing during the fight , but the fact that 24th Infantry troops were quick to withdraw was also blamed . The regiment , a mostly black unit left over from the US military 's recently abolished segregated system , was blasted for its poor performance during the fight . Walker , seeing the 24th Infantry as an ineffective unit , resolved to use it only as a " trip wire force " on the front lines , requiring it to be reinforced by another regiment in reserve to conduct serious resistance when the 24th broke . Other leaders saw the poor performance as a reason to demand further integration of the armed forces , which had not been easy to do before the war . The 24th Infantry was fully desegregated on October 1 , 1951 . 
 In reaching the upper Naktong valley at the end of July , the North Korean divisions engaged in this part of the drive southward had suffered heavy casualties . The NK 1st Division in battling across the Mun 'gyong plateau against the ROK 6th Division not only suffered great losses in the ground battle but also took serious losses from UN aerial attack . Prisoners reported that by the time it reached Hamch 'ang at the end of July it was down to 3 @,@ 000 men from the 5 @,@ 500 it had before the push . The NK 15th Division , according to prisoners , also lost heavily to artillery and mortar fire in its drive on Sangju against ROK troops and the US 24th Infantry Regiment , and was down to about 5 @,@ 000 men at the end of July , from 7 @,@ 500 before the fight . In contrast , the NK 13th Division had bypassed Hamch 'ang on the west and , save for minor skirmishes with ROK troops and the 2nd Battalion , 35th Infantry , it had not been engaged and consequently had suffered relatively few casualties . 
 In the years since the war , the battle has been investigated as an example of the prevalence of racism in the US Army during the Korean War . The 24th Infantry , though officially desegregated , was still made up overwhelmingly of African @-@ American soldiers . Historians contend its accomplishments , particularly at Yechon , were ignored while shortcomings were seized upon to depict the 24th as a sub @-@ par unit and African @-@ Americans as inferior soldiers to whites . Historians have also pointed out that although the performance of the 24th Infantry was indeed poor , these failings were exaggerated due to racism . Black Soldier , White Army , a 1988 book by William T. Bowers , William M. Hammond and George L. <unk> , concluded that a combination of an overextended line and inexperienced white officers who were not firm or effective in asserting their authority were the primary factors in the performance of the 24th . Others contend that the untested regiment performed similarly to units of the 24th Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division in their first engagements . With training , many of the same troops became effective fighters in a matter of weeks . Lieutenant Colonel Charles M. <unk> , a member of the 24th Infantry that participated in the battle , claimed in his memoir Firefight at Yechon : Courage and Racism in the Korean War that the 24th Infantry 's good performances , particularly at Yechon , were ignored , and soldiers denied medals for their actions because of racism .

 Route 246 is a 15 @.@ 002 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 24 @.@ 143 km ) east — west highway in extreme northern Missouri . The western terminus is at Route 148 in Hopkins . The route travels eastward to supplemental Route E , where it becomes concurrent and starts traveling south . It then continues east to its terminus at Route 46 east of Sheridan . Formerly a spur route of Route 46 and supplemental Route D , Route 246 was designated around 1954 , and was extended west to Hopkins in 1955 .

 All of Route 246 is a two @-@ lane undivided highway . It starts at Route 148 as McPherson Street in Hopkins and heads eastward . The road soon leaves Hopkins and enters widespread farmlands . Less than a mile later , Route 246 meets the northern terminus of Route AC , a supplemental route . The route continues eastward for several miles , until it intersects Route E. There , it becomes concurrent with Route E , and moves south for two miles . After the route leaves Route E , it continues east towards Sheridan . The road passes through more farmland with a few trees , and crosses into Worth County . Near Sheridan , Route 246 shifts slightly north , and continues east toward the center of the village . Route 246 intersects the southern terminus of Route H , and leaves Sheridan . The road crosses over the One Hundred and Two River and shifts back southward . The route ends at Route 46 at a T @-@ intersection a few miles east of Sheridan . The highest traffic count is east of Sheridan , where 541 vehicles travel the road daily , on average . The lowest traffic count is along the four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) west of Route E , where 152 vehicles travel the road daily , on average .

 Between 1918 and 1926 , Route 46 was extended to Sheridan . Soon after , in 1933 , it extended south , two miles east of Sheridan . The extension caused the road to Sheridan to become a spur route of Route 46 . The spur route was then extended west into <unk> County around 1948 – 1949 , and was numbered supplemental route D. Four years later , the route was extended to Route 27 ( now Route 148 ) . In 1954 , Route 246 was designated , starting from Sheridan , and ending at Route 46 . The next year , Route 246 was extended to replace supplemental route D as the main connector from Hopkins to Route 46 . The whole route was surfaced in concrete by 1959 .

 = Cyclone Gamede = 
 Cyclone Gamede was among the wettest tropical cyclones on record , dropping more than 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) of rain in a nine @-@ day period on Réunion island in the southwest Indian Ocean . The seventh named storm of the 2006 – 07 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season , Gamede formed on February 20 as a tropical depression to the south of Diego Garcia . It tracked generally westward and steadily intensified , passing northwest of Mauritius and Réunion as a broad but moderately intense tropical cyclone . For four days it remained within 400 km ( 250 mi ) of Réunion before accelerating southward , and on March 3 Gamede transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the south of Madagascar . 
 Gamede broke rainfall records set by Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe 27 years earlier for the accumulated totals between three and nine days . The rainfall caused moderate damage in Réunion , and in the southern portion of the island a bridge collapsed due to the storm . Two people each were killed on Mauritius and Réunion . The name Gamede was submitted to the World Meteorological Organization by South Africa . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On February 19 , an area of convection persisted over a weak , but well @-@ defined low @-@ level circulation about 1130 km ( 700 mi ) southeast of Diego Garcia . It quickly developed banding features , and organized into a tropical disturbance . Located beneath an anticyclone , the system experienced weak vertical wind shear and favorable outflow . With a subtropical ridge to its south , the disturbance tracked quickly westward . Early on February 20 , Météo @-@ France ( MFR ) classified the system as Tropical Depression Ten , and later in the day the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the convection improved significantly in organization . It strengthened further , attaining tropical storm status by 0000 UTC on February 21 , and six hours later the MFR named the system Gamede while it was about 785 km ( 490 mi ) south @-@ southwest of Diego Garcia , or about 995 km ( 620 mi ) northeast of Rodrigues . 
 After being named , Gamede quickly intensified , and the JTWC classified it with winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) early on February 22 . As it turned west @-@ southwestward , an eye feature became evident on satellite imagery , and the JTWC upgraded Gamede to tropical cyclone status , or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane . Subsequently , its intensification rate slowed somewhat , due to restricted outflow . At 0000 UTC on February 23 the MFR upgraded the storm to Tropical Cyclone Gamede , and shortly thereafter it passed over St. Brandon island . Subsequently , outflow became better established , and the JTWC unofficially estimated the cyclone attained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) late on February 23 about 250 km ( 400 mi ) north @-@ northeast of Mauritius island . Initially it was forecast to strengthen further , though slight weakening occurred when a nearby upper @-@ level trough restricted outflow . 
 Cyclone Gamede remained a broad system , and by February 24 it produced winds of near gale force up to 670 km ( 415 mi ) southeast of its center ; later in the day , it passed about 300 km ( 190 mi ) north of Réunion , its closest point of approach to the island . For over 90 hours , the cyclone remained within 400 km ( 250 mi ) of the island , resulting in torrential rainfall in the island 's mountainous region . Radar imagery on the island indicated Gamede maintained an eye diameter of 60 – 70 km ( 37 – 43 mi ) . After tracking generally southwestward for several days , a building ridge to its south changed the motion of the cyclone to the west before it became quasi @-@ stationary . Initially , it was predicted to continue westward and strike Madagascar near Toamasina . The cyclone re @-@ intensified while executing a small loop , and late on February 25 Gamede officially attained peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) about halfway between Réunion island and the coast of Madagascar ; at the time , wind gusts in association with the storm reached 230 km / h ( 135 mph ) . 
 The cyclone weakened while remaining nearly stationary , losing most of its deep convection due to upwelling ; this is the process in which a stationary storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler , deeper waters to the surface . It remained nearly stationary until beginning a steady south @-@ southwestward motion late on February 26 , a change due to an approaching mid @-@ level trough to its south . On February 28 , convection increased around a rebuilding eyewall as it accelerated southward , though on March 1 the cyclone again weakened as wind shear increased and as water temperatures gradually decreased . Gamede weakened to tropical storm status as its center became exposed from the deep convection , and late on March 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . After completing the transition , the storm became nearly stationary for about two days , during which its winds decreased to below gale force . The remnants of Gamede turned westward and persisted until dissipating on March 6 .
