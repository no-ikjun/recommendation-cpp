 = = Plot = = 
 Unmarried princess Kunti is blessed by the Sun god with a baby boy , which she abandons in the Ganges to avoid embarrassment . The boy is rescued and adopted by charioteer Athirathan , and is named Karnan . Years later , the now @-@ grown up Karnan realises that Athirathan is only his adoptive father and feels heartbroken . He does not want to become a charioteer like Athirathan , and instead chooses to become a warrior . He masters archery and challenges the Pandava prince Arjuna in a contest . Karnan is insulted on account of his lowly birth , but the Kaurava prince and cousin of the Pandavas , Duryodhana , saves his pride , and gives him the kingdom of Anga . Karnan thus becomes the close friend of Duryodhana and his wife Bhanumati . 
 One day , Indra , the king of the Devas ( celestial deities ) , disguised as a Brahmin , approaches Karnan and asks for his armour and ear rings in donation to weaken and stop him from overpowering Arjuna . Aware of Indra 's intention , Karnan yet donates both the items he was born with and which would make him invincible . Pleased with Karnan 's generosity , Indra gives him a powerful weapon , Nagastra , but states that he can use it only once . Karnan , disguised as a Brahmin , becomes the student of the sage Parasurama to acquire the Brahmastra ; one day , however , Parasurama realises that Karnan is a Kshatriya , a tribe he opposes . Enraged , he renders Karnan incapable of using the Brahmastra when most needed , and banishes him . 
 Karnan later saves princess Subhangi from an uncontrolled chariot , and they fall in love . Subhangi 's parents initially disapprove of their romance , but eventually they accept , and the couple get married . A few years later , Krishna , a supporter of the Pandavas , learns about Karnan 's true background . He tells Kunti that Karnan is her first son whom she abandoned . Karnan gets to know about his birth later . Kunti meets Karnan and gets two wishes from him , one that he will not attack any of her sons ( the Pandavas ) except Arjuna during the impending Kurukshetra War , and that he will attack Arjuna with the Nagastra weapon only once . Karnan refuses to join his brothers , the Pandavas and remains the friend of their enemy Duryodhana . 
 Before the start of the Kurukshetra war , Duryodhana ’ s ministry assembles to appoint the generals of the army . Bhishma is appointed the Commander and he starts nominating generals for different battalions . Karnan is insulted on account of his lowly birth and given the command of a low rank infantry . The war begins and in the early days , Bhishma retires and Karnan replaces him . The following day , Karnan goes to war accompanied by his son Vrishasena who fights bravely , but is killed by Arjuna afterwards . 
 The next day , the vengeful Karnan uses the Nagastra to try killing Arjuna , but Krishna saves Arjuna by preventing the arrow from hurting him . Since Karnan cannot use the Nagastra more than once , he is unable to kill Arjuna . A wheel of his chariot gets stuck in a big hole , and he steps down to relieve it . At that time , Arjuna , under the direction of Krishna , shoots many arrows at Karnan that severely wound him . Krishna tells Arjuna that the Dharma ( noble charity ) that Karnan performed during his lifetime was protecting his life . Krishna disguises as a Brahmin , goes to Karnan and asks him his virtues as donation . Out of generosity , Karnan donates all his virtues to the " Brahmin " . At this juncture , Arjuna shoots a few more arrows at Karnan that kill him . The Pandavas , who realise that Karnan was their eldest brother mourn his death . His mother Kunti also mourns his death , while Subhangi dies due to the trauma of her husband 's death in the war . Arjuna <unk> killing Karnan , until Krishna reveals that the curses by Indra and Parasurama were also responsible for his death . The film ends with Karnan meeting his father — the Sun in the other world .

 Karnan is based on the life of the character Karna from the Hindu epic Mahabharata , and was officially launched in 1963 at Vijaya Studios in Chennai . B. R. Panthulu , who directed and produced the film under the banner Padmini Pictures , had " based his screen play on traditional sources " and collected most of his information from scholars <unk> <unk> and <unk> Dikshitar . 
 The film 's art work , one of the major highlights of the film , was led by Ganga , and the cinematography was handled by V. Ramamurthy . Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy wrote the dialogues , and A. S. Nagarajan wrote the screenplay . R. <unk> was the editor . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Sivaji Ganesan was cast in the title role , Telugu actor N. T. Rama Rao as Krishna , and R. Muthuraman as Arjuna . Actresses Devika and Savitri were cast in the female lead roles , and S. A. Ashokan as Karna 's friend Duryodhana . 
 The role of Karna 's mother was portrayed by M. V. Rajamma , and actress Sandhya played Karna 's mother @-@ in @-@ law . Other supporting cast members included actor Shanmugasundaram as the charioteer <unk> Chakravarthy , V. S.

Sridhar finished his long scene in one take , and was paid ₹ 1000 ( valued at about US $ 210 in 1964 ) for the performance . Actor K. V. Srinivasan played a minor role as the sage who christens the lead character as Karnan . He also dubbed for the voice of Rama Rao , after Ganesan 's insistence with Panthulu . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Karnan was filmed with an estimated budget of ₹ 4 million ( valued at about US $ 840 000 @.@ 84 in 1964 ) . The high cost of the film was attributed to the transportation costs incurred to move chariots from Chennai to Kurukshetra , where the war sequences were filmed . Permission from the government was sought , cavalry and infantry from the Indian Army were brought to the locations at Kurukshetra and the first rows of the charging armies on horses and elephants had soldiers from the Indian Army . The battle scenes were shot with troupes of the 61 Cavalry Regiment , using 80 elephants , 400 horses and three cameras . Other scenes were shot at palaces in Jaipur . Shooting for Karnan also took place at the Bangalore Palace in the Cantonment area , making it the first film to be shot there . 
 In 2012 , Panthulu 's son <unk> revealed that a few shots involving Ganesan and Rama Rao took as many as four days to shoot , because of the large number of personnel involved . After the release of Karnan , all the chariots specially made for the war sequences in Kurukshetra , were donated to the Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur . 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 Viswanathan – Ramamoorthy ( a duo consisting of M. S. Viswanathan and T. K. Ramamoorthy ) composed the music of Karnan , while the lyrics were written by Kannadasan . The soundtrack was released under the label of Saregama . Notable instruments used for recording the songs include Sarangi , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and other such instruments that were rarely used in Tamil films . The entire soundtrack was completed in a span of three days . The songs " En <unk> <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> Engey " and " <unk> <unk> " are based on the <unk> Kalyani , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> ragas respectively . The soundtrack was very successful , with the critic Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu stating that " Musically , Karnan is of a calibre that few have surpassed " and that the " Panthulu @-@ <unk> Mannar [ M. S. Viswanathan ] combo resulted in songs that will live on forever " .

 The soundtrack received generally positive reviews from critics . Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu said , " My interest in Karnan ( apart from the critic 's mandate that I see everything ) was primarily the songs " , but noted that Sirkazhi <unk> 's " liquid diction and brass @-@ throated conviction makes today 's male singers sound like tentative little boys in a parent 's day recital " . Meera Srinivasan , another critic from The Hindu praised the film for the " music score and songs by the inimitable Viswanathan @-@ Ramamoorthy duo with Kannadasan 's striking lyrics " . Malathi Rangarajan said , " The illustrious composing duo of Viswanathan and Ramamurthy has worked magic with music " . M.

Vijayan of The New Straits Times said , " Instead of trooping out , the audience sat through the 14 songs composed by the Viswanathan @-@ <unk> pair . They are that famous and many can sing along to the lyrics as the songs have been heard countless times on the radio " .

 Karnan , which was released in 38 screens , was the most expected film during the festival occasion of Pongal on 14 January 1964 , and Shanthi theatre in Chennai , which released the film , had a 60 feet ( 18 m ) tall banner of a chariot to attract the audience . Ganesan promoted the film by distributing <unk> <unk> ( sweetened rice ) to those who came to Shanthi to attend the film 's first screening . Karnan was the first of a " mythology series " of films that made a comeback during the 1960s . It was also a trendsetter for mythological films in a period when films with social messages were popular . Karnan was also considered a milestone in Tamil cinema as it brought together the then leading actors of South Indian cinema , Sivaji Ganesan and N. T. Rama Rao . The film was dubbed in Telugu as Karna , and also in Hindi as <unk> Veer Karna .

 In its theatrical run , Karnan completed 100 days in four theatres , including Madurai Thangam ( noted as the second largest theatre in Asia during 1964 ) , and also completed 105 days at Ganesan 's family @-@ owned Shanthi theatre . In spite of a successful run after completing 80 days , the film was removed from twelve theatres to allow the release of <unk> <unk> , another Sivaji Ganesan film . At Madurai Thangam , Karnan earned totally ₹ 186 @,@ 805 @.@ 62 after its 14 @-@ week run there . Since most films of the time in the Tamil film industry did not have box office reports , the film 's exact collections are unknown , although critics like Baradwaj Rangan and M.

 Reviews for Karnan have been mostly positive . Ayngaran International called the film " One of the all time great Indian classics with a fantastic star cast and great acting " . Meera Srinivasan of The Hindu stated , " Karnan , directed by B.R. Panthulu in 1964 , is considered a classic for many reasons , including the stunning performances of Sivaji as Karnan and <unk> Rama Rao as Lord Krishna " , while highlighting " the powerful battlefield sequences and the music score " . M. Suganth of The Times of India gave the film 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars , saying " The pacing is uneven , the complexities of the plot are overtly simplified , " and added that " the narrative isn 't tightly structured " but praised Ganesan 's performance as a " pitch @-@ perfect larger @-@ than @-@ life performance " and Rama Rao 's portrayal of Krishna as " the definitive portrayal of the Lord on screen " , calling it " one of the delights of the film " . Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu called the film 's artwork " an exercise in aesthetic splendour " and added , " If the technical crew is brilliant , so is the cast that has Sivaji Ganesan at the helm . " Film historian Firoze Rangoonwalla , in his book 75 years of Indian cinema , called the film a " spectacular mythological " . 
 Rediff.com called it " one of the most significant films in Sivaji Ganesan 's career " . K. N. Vijayan of The New Straits Times said , " The actions of certain characters , like Indra and Krishna may appear perplexing to some . Some reading on the internet is needed to understand their reasons " . He however praised the film 's dialogues by Sakthi Krishnasamy as " classical " and concluded , " Such [ a ] mythological film is important for the younger generation " . Anupama Subramanian of Deccan Chronicle called it " the timeless <unk> [ sic ] classic of thespian Sivaji Ganesan " . G. Dhananjayan , in his book The Best of Tamil Cinema : 1931 to 1976 , praised the film for being " the only Tamil film which portrayed the mythological character Karnan in a grand manner . " 
 The film also received mixed reviews from other critics . Ananda Vikatan said , " Though this effort to improve the quality of Tamil cinema must be appreciated , we do not see the dignity of the epic and only see the dominance of the extravaganza . " In 2012 , Baradwaj Rangan called the film " a historical epic with little so @-@ called relevance to contemporary life ( unless you want to acknowledge the Duryodhana @-@ Karna storyline as the granddaddy of today 's <unk> ) " and stated that Ganesan 's performance " isn 't as all @-@ consuming as his performance in , say , [ Thiruvilaiyadal ] ; The Mahabharata , after all , is a tale with an ensemble cast , unlike The Ramayana with its solo hero " , while calling Rama Rao 's performance a " sly , campy take on Krishna " . 
 Dhananjayan opined that Ganesan 's performance was influenced by Veerapandiya Kattabomman ( 1959 ) and that his excessive emotions in several scenes were not well received by the audience . Nevertheless , at the 11th National Film Awards in 1964 , the film won the Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film .

 Actor Y. G. Mahendra said , " Karnan can never be remade . Nobody can replace any of the actors of the 1964 classic , and it would amount to mockery if it is done . " Actor Rana Daggubati , in an interview with Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu , said that Ganesan 's performances as Kattabomman and Karna served as inspirations for his role in Baahubali : The Beginning ( 2015 ) .

 A digitally restored version of Karnan was released on 16 March 2012 , to commemorate the birth centenary of Panthulu . It is the first Tamil film to be fully digitally restored , costing ₹ 4 million ( US $ 59 @,@ 000 ) and consuming an effort of three years . The effort was undertaken by film distributor Shanthi <unk> , who stated , " The sound negative was totally gone and the five to six reels from the picture negative were damaged to a great extent " . The digital restoration of Karnan took place at Sangeetha Sound Studios in Chennai , after a failed attempt with the Mumbai @-@ based Famous Studios , who earlier restored the 1960 Hindi film Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam . Visual improvements and audio restoration were excessively worked upon , with Shanthi stating that the " biggest challenge was to restore the background score " . DVDs were also used to get the sound and music in its original form . To create awareness about the restoration of Karnan , a teaser trailer was launched on 21 February 2012 , which received a positive response . 
 The restored version of Karnan which utilised DTS 5 @.@ 1 surround sound , was released in 72 screens across Tamil Nadu , and was released by Shanthi 's Divya Films . It was well received upon release , although The Times of India 's critic M. Suganth called the restoration process " far from perfect " , and critic Baradwaj Rangan quoted , " The print occasionally <unk> , leaving the impression of watching the movie on a screen mounted behind the driver 's seat in an auto rickshaw " . Taking a big opening , the film collected roughly ₹ 20 million ( US $ 300 @,@ 000 ) in Chennai within the first few weeks , and was later reported to have collected a total of ₹ 50 million ( US $ 740 @,@ 000 ) . Becoming the first Tamil film to have a theatrical run of over 100 days in its re @-@ release , and having surpassed what it originally managed to collect in its entire 105 day run at Shanthi theatre , the film was officially declared a commercial success . It 's success soon established a trend of digitising and re @-@ releasing films in Tamil cinema .

 U.S. Route 50 ( US 50 ) is a major east – west route of the U.S. Highway system , stretching just over 3 @,@ 000 miles ( 4 @,@ 800 km ) from Ocean City , Maryland on the Atlantic Ocean to West Sacramento , California . Until 1972 , when it was replaced by Interstate Highways west of the Sacramento area , it extended ( by way of Stockton , the Altamont Pass , and the Bay Bridge ) to San Francisco , near the Pacific Ocean . The Interstates were constructed later and are mostly separate from this route . It generally serves a corridor south of Interstates 70 and 80 and north of Interstates 64 and 40 . The route runs through mostly rural desert and mountains in the Western United States , with the section through Nevada known as " The Loneliest Road in America " . In the Midwest , US 50 continues through mostly rural areas of farms as well as a few large cities including Kansas City , Missouri ; St. Louis , Missouri ; and Cincinnati , Ohio . The route continues into the Eastern United States , where it passes through the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia before heading through Washington , D.C. From there , US 50 continues through Maryland as a high @-@ speed road to Ocean City . Signs at each end give the length as 3 @,@ 073 miles ( 4 @,@ 946 km ) , but the actual distance is slightly less , due to realignments since the former figure was measured . US 50 passes through a total of 12 states ; California , Nevada , Utah , Colorado , Kansas , Missouri , Illinois , Indiana , Ohio , West Virginia , Virginia , and Maryland , as well as the District of Columbia . 
 US 50 was created in 1926 as part of the original U.S. Highway system . The original route planned in 1925 ran from Wadsworth , Nevada east to Annapolis , Maryland along several auto trails including the Lincoln Highway , Midland Trail , and the National Old Trails Road . The final 1926 plan had US 50 running from Sacramento , California east to Annapolis with a gap in west Utah that was bridged by running the route north via Salt Lake City before rerouting it to U.S. Route 6 in the 1950s . US 50 was extended west from Sacramento to San Francisco in the 1930s , replacing U.S. Route 48 ; this was reversed in 1964 when Interstate 580 replaced much of the route between the two cities . In addition , US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City prior in 1949 , replacing a portion of U.S. Route 213 . US 50 had two split configurations into U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S , one in Kansas and another in Ohio and West Virginia ; both of these instances have been removed .

 US 50 begins as a major freeway at its junction with Interstate 80 in West Sacramento and continues into Sacramento . The portion of US 50 west of and including its interchange with California 's State Highway 99 in Sacramento is also designated , but not signed as , Interstate 305 . The signage along this portion of the highway indicates Business Loop I @-@ 80 and a portion of the way ( 2 miles / 3 @.@ 33 km ) as California State Highway 99 . From Sacramento , the highway heads eastward as the William Alexander <unk> , Jr . Memorial Highway , continuing as a freeway to the Gold Country foothills , then following the American River up the Sierra Nevada as a conventional highway , until cresting the Sierras at Echo Summit and descending to Lake Tahoe , where the highway enters Nevada . In Nevada , the highway crosses a series of north – south running mountain ranges that break up the Nevada desert which are called Basin and Range . East of Carson City , the road enters the heart of the Great Basin , passing by few communities and minimal services , giving it the name " Loneliest Road in America " until reaching Utah . 
 In Utah , US 50 also passes through desolate , remote areas with few inhabitants . After crossing the Confusion Range via Kings Canyon and the House Range , the road traverses the north shore of the endorheic Sevier Lake . In Holden , US 50 shortly overlaps Interstate 15 to cross the Pavant Range . The road begins a much longer overlap with Interstate 70 in Salina crossing the Wasatch Plateau and San Rafael Swell into Colorado . US 50 leaves I @-@ 70 upon entering the state and heads southeast through Grand Junction and into the southern part of Colorado . Once there , the road climbs to its highest elevation of 11 @,@ 312 feet ( 3 @,@ 448 m ) over the Rocky Mountains and in Monarch Pass where it crosses the Continental Divide . After descending from the Rockies , US 50 passes by Royal Gorge near Cañon City then joins U.S. Route 400 in Granada and follows the Arkansas River into Kansas . 
 = = = Midwestern U.S. = = = 
 Upon entering Kansas , US 50 , concurrent with US 400 , runs along the Arkansas River to Dodge City where US 50 splits from US 400 and takes a more northerly course . US 50 continues to traverse the farmlands and small towns of the Great Plains mostly as a straight two @-@ lane road until Emporia where it joins Interstate 35 and splits onto Interstate 435 to bypass the center of the Kansas City Area . In Missouri , US 50 leaves I @-@ 435 for Interstate 470 splitting at Lee 's Summit . US 50 runs as a four @-@ lane divided highway across the Western Plain to Sedalia where it continues as a two @-@ lane road until reaching California , MO about 20 miles west of Jefferson City . The road continues as a four @-@ lane divided highway into Jefferson City where it joins US 63 just south of the Missouri River Bridge . It continues 12 miles east of Jefferson City to the Osage River where US 63 splits off to the south . It then continues as a two @-@ lane road as it traverses the northern sections of the Ozark Highlands east to Union where it begins an overlap with Interstate 44 which goes through Pacific . The routes separate in Sunset Hills where US 50 migrates southeast bypassing St Louis by joining Interstate 255 to cross Mississippi River into Illinois . 
 In that state , US 50 switches to Interstate 64 before splitting onto its own alignment in eastern O 'Fallon . It heads east through Trenton , Breese , Carlyle crossing the Kaskaskia River , Salem , Flora and Lawrenceville to the Wabash River along a corridor between Interstates 64 and 70 . US 50 enters Indiana at the Wabash River , bypassing Vincennes and Washington and passing through Bedford , Seymour , and Versailles . It meets the Ohio River at Aurora , and soon crosses into Ohio , running through downtown Cincinnati via Fort Washington Way ( Interstate 71 ) . The route crosses southern Ohio via Hillsboro , Chillicothe , and Athens , joining the four @-@ lane divided Corridor D ( State Route 32 ) west of Athens .

 The portion of US 50 from Parkersburg , West Virginia to Winchester , Virginia follows the historic Northwestern Turnpike , which crosses the southern tip of Garrett County , Maryland . From Parkersburg to Interstate 79 east of Clarksburg , US 50 has been upgraded as part of the four @-@ lane divided Corridor D. US 50 is a curving two @-@ lane mountain road , east of Clarksburg through Grafton , a bit of Maryland , and Romney to Winchester . This portion of the road is so curvy that locals claim " you can meet yourself coming " . The land flattens out after the route crosses the Shenandoah Mountains east of Winchester , and it follows the old Little River Turnpike from <unk> to Fairfax and the newer Arlington Boulevard to Rosslyn , where it crosses the District of Columbia line on the west shore of the Potomac River and joins Interstate 66 on the Roosevelt Bridge . 
 Within the District , US 50 immediately exits the freeway onto Constitution Avenue along the north side of the National Mall and south of the White House . After turning north on 6th Street Northwest , it exits the city to the northeast on New York Avenue . Upon crossing into Maryland , it passes the south end of the Baltimore @-@ Washington Parkway and becomes the John Hanson Highway , a freeway to Annapolis . The portion of this highway east of the Capital Beltway ( I @-@ 95 / I @-@ 495 ) is also designated , but not signed as , Interstate 595 , and U.S. Route 301 joins from the south at Bowie . The freeway continues beyond Annapolis as the Blue Star Memorial Highway which crosses Chesapeake Bay on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and continues to Queenstown . There the Blue Star Highway continues northeast as US 301 , while US 50 turns south , passing through Easton to Cambridge , and then east through Salisbury to Ocean City on the four @-@ lane divided Ocean Gateway . US 50 ends near the Atlantic Ocean shore at Baltimore Avenue ( Maryland Route 528 northbound ) ; its westbound beginning is one block to the west , at Philadelphia Avenue ( MD 528 southbound ) . 
 = = History = = 
 Before the creation of the Interstate Highway System after World War II , US 50 was a major east – west route . Numbered highways in the United States follow a pattern of odd numbers for north – south routes and even numbers for east – west routes , hence the designation of " 50 " for this route . In the preliminary report , approved by the Joint Board on Interstate Highways in late 1925 , US 50 ran from Wadsworth , Nevada to Annapolis , Maryland , passing through Pueblo , Colorado ; Kansas City , Missouri ; Tipton , Missouri ; St. Louis , Missouri ; Cincinnati , Ohio , and Washington , D.C. The route did not directly replace any auto trail , instead combining portions of many into one continuous route . It followed the historic Northwestern Turnpike across West Virginia , and portions of other historic roads . Major auto trails followed , including the Midland Trail in part of Indiana , Illinois , Missouri , and parts of Utah and Colorado . The National Old Trails Road ( Old Santa Fe Trail ) was designated in Kansas and eastern Colorado , and the Lincoln Highway was constructed in Nevada . In most states that had numbered their state highways , US 50 followed only one or two numbers across the state . 
 One major controversy related to the preliminary route of US 50 . The through route had been assigned to the Old Santa Fe Trail , while the spur U.S. Route 250 followed the competing New Santa Fe Trail to the south . As a compromise , the Joint Board on Interstate Highways approved a split configuration — U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S — in January . Another problem was in western Utah , where no improved road existed for US 50 to use . The final numbering plan , approved in November 1926 , left a gap in US 50 between Ely , Nevada and Thistle , Utah . Finally , rather than ending US 50 at Wadsworth , where the Lincoln and Victory Highways merged , it was sent over the Lincoln Highway 's Pioneer Branch , past the south side of Lake Tahoe , to Sacramento , California . 
 The gap in Utah was soon bypassed by taking US 50 to the north , crossing the Great Salt Lake Desert with U.S. Route 40 to Salt Lake City , and using long portions of U.S. Route 93 in Nevada and U.S. Route 89 in Utah . U.S. Route 6 was marked along the direct , but still partially unimproved , route in 1937 ; it was finally paved in 1952 , and US 50 was moved to it within a few years . Another straightening was made in 1976 , when US 50 in central Utah was moved south onto the new extension of Interstate 70 at the request of the National Highway 50 Federation , a group dedicated to promoting US 50 . Among other things , the group has unsuccessfully pushed for an extension of Interstate 70 west along US 50 to California . 
 The north – south split in Kansas was eliminated in the late 1950s , with the south route — which was to be US 250 — becoming part of US 50 , and most of US 50N becoming part of a new U.S. Route 56 . Another split was located between Athens , Ohio and <unk> , West Virginia from the late 1920s to the mid @-@ 1930s , when US 50 went back to its original southern route ; that U.S. Route 50N is now Ohio State Route 550 and part of West Virginia Route 16 . 
 At its west end , US 50 was extended south from Sacramento along U.S. Route 99 to Stockton and west to the San Francisco Bay Area , replacing U.S. Route 48 , by the early 1930s . US 50 was officially cut back to Sacramento in the 1964 renumbering , replaced by Interstate 580 , but remained on maps and signs for several more years . US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City , Maryland in 1949 , three years prior to the opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952 ; this extension replaced Maryland Route 404 between Annapolis and Wye Mills and U.S. Route 213 between Wye Mills and Ocean City . Prior to the bridge opening , US 50 used a ferry across the Chesapeake Bay between Sandy Point and Matapeake and followed present @-@ day Maryland Route 8 between Matapeake and Stevensville before continuing east .

 = Hurricane Nina ( 1957 ) = 
 Hurricane Nina was the final tropical storm and hurricane of the 1957 Pacific hurricane season and the last storm to form during the active Central Pacific hurricane season this year . This storm was named " Nina " because during this time , hurricanes in this basin were given names from the typhoon naming lists . This storm was the last to form during a series of typhoons to form in the Pacific in November . 
 Nina never made landfall while active , although some forecasts called for Nina to be the first hurricane to make landfall on Hawaii , but the hurricane veered west before hitting land . However , it came close enough to Hawaii to cause light damage and prompt evacuations . Nina was the first hurricane to affect the island of Kauai at that intensity . This storm was preceded by a winter storm that caused damaging surf along the north coast of Kauai and was both preceded and proceeded by cold fronts sweeping over Hawaii . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On November 29 a disturbance in the ITCZ began gaining organization near Palmyra Island , which the ITCZ had been near for a week prior . The weather station on the island reported southwestern surface winds of 50 mph and a pressure of 1002 @.@ 7 mbar and that during the night , the wind velocity peaked at 70 mph . Because of an irregular schedule for reporting , the last report received from the weather station , obtained eighteen hours earlier , had reported only small winds and 1004 @.@ 7 mb pressure . Most noteworthy about this report was the 3 @-@ hour pressure tendency , which reported <unk> mbar . Post @-@ analysis revealed that this tendency was an indication of tropical cyclone development . 
 After receiving the second report on the 29th , warnings were immediately put out on the cyclone , which was given the name " Nina " from the typhoon list . For 24 hours , the center of the storm was reported to be stationary as the weather on Palmyra was continuously abnormal , but the next day , an aircraft from the Air Force showed that the storm was 500 miles north of the island and that it had intensified to hurricane strength . After six more hours , Nina 's forward speed had quickly slowed 16 mph while the storm began a northward track , heading towards Kauai , but before reaching the island , the storm turned first to the north @-@ northwest on December 2 and then sharply to the west later that day . 
 On December 4 Nina had reached its peak intensity of 85 mph . At this time , a polar high pressure system moved off the coast of Japan . The system reached Nina on December 6 and forced the hurricane into a southward path . Twenty hours after the turn , the cold air from the system got trapped inside the circulation of Nina and caused the storm to rapidly dissipate . The last advisory on the system was issued early on December 7 while Nina was at depression strength south of Midway Atoll . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Despite never moving onto land , Nina 's proximity to Hawaii and the forecasts for an imminent landfall resulted in massive evacuations . An estimated 300 people living in Hanapepe and Hanalei were forced to evacuate when the Hanalei River overflowed its banks . An estimated 1 @,@ 500 people on Kauai were evacuated to higher ground , where the Red Cross had established seven evacuation centers for these people to evacuate to . In addition , thirteen members of the United States Coast Guard were evacuated from low @-@ lying islands and harbors when they were threatened by rising tides triggered by the hurricane and the threat of flooding forced 420 military personnel and families in Waikiki 's Ft . <unk> and Ft . Armstrong as well as those living in Ft . Kamehameha , near Pearl Harbor to leave for higher ground . 270 were housed in Tripler Army Hospital and a temporary shelter was opened in Ft . Shafter , both of which were on high ground . In anticipation of Nina , 85 planes were flown away from Barber 's Point Naval Air Base to Midway and several commercial flights were cancelled until the storm had passed . There was also concern for the residents of the privately owned Niihau , the closest landmass to the center of Nina and 20 miles closer than Kauai . The island 's only communications was by boat and most attempts at reaching the island failed due to high surf . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Despite the evacuations , Nina 's closest approach to Hawaii was 120 miles away . However , it came close enough to bring winds and heavy rain to the islands . There were four deaths reported in connection to the storm . The first reported was on Oahu when Herman <unk> , a lineman in the Honolulu street department , was killed when he was electrocuted by a power line downed during Nina 's passing . Soon after , a sampan called the Setsu Maru sent a distress call reporting that the boat was sinking 10 miles east of Niihau . Even though the Navy sent the submarine rescue vessel <unk> and conducted an air @-@ seas search for the vessel , no trace of the sampan or the wreckage had been found . All three people aboard the boat were reported dead as a result . Another person in Hanapepe was injured when a tree came through a window in his house , causing minor forehead cuts . The phone lines to the county seat of Kauai County , Lihue , were broken during the hurricane . The Aloha Theater in Hanapepe had been flooded by up to three feet of water . Reports from the five major islands indicated that less than 50 homes had been damaged during the storm and roughly 12 of them being destroyed on Kauai alone . Another ship disaster occurred when the Greek freighter Margarita Chandris got caught in the storm 's winds while heading to Honolulu from Kobe . A distress call from the ship described the ship as " out of control " . The initial fears were that the winds from Nina would pull the ship closer to its center . These fears were made worse when the ship was found to be <unk> , making it easier to be moved by the waves . A later call said that the crew was unable to steer the ship . Three ships , the Rainier , the United States Coast Guard cutter Winnebago and the <unk> President Monroe , were sent out to find and guide the Chandris to port . The Monroe finally found the freighter and guided it toward land until the Winnebago caught up . The cutter finally caught up to the Margarita Chandris and relieved the President Monroe and started planning to board and make repairs . Afterward , it was decided that the Margarita Chandris had enough fuel to drift into Honolulu alone . Nina 's proximity also caused heavy rains , with 20 @.@ 42 inches falling in Wainiha in 14 hours . Overall , Hurricane Nina was responsible for $ 100 @,@ 000 in damages ( 1957 USD ) , mostly from heavy surf , some of which measured 35 feet high . 
 = = = Records and naming = = = 
 While Nina was near Honolulu , it caused unusually high winds . When wind gusts of 82 mph were recorded at Honolulu airport during the storm , it set the record for highest wind gust ever recorded in that city . This was the first and last time a Central Pacific hurricane was named " Nina " . The name was not retired , but because of the use of a current naming list using the Hawaiian language , the name " Nina " will likely not be used again .

 The game is a top @-@ down turn @-@ based strategy which contains elements of arcade gameplay and focuses mainly on tank combat . It is a simulation of the 1941 Siege of Tobruk , a part of the Western Desert Campaign of World War II . The battle revolves around Australian and British ( collectively referred to Allied forces ) attempts to oust German field marshal Erwin Rommel from the city . If playing alone , the player controls the Axis powers and is not able to play on the side of the Allies unless a second player is involved . The main objective of the game is to capture and hold as many fortifications in Italian Libya as possible , with the city of Tobruk and the defence of Rommel being the ultimate goals . 
 The main display map of the game is focused on Cyrenaica , a representation of the Allied minefield that was laid in the Gazala Line between Gazala and Bir <unk> . The Axis troops begin the game on the western side of the line , whilst Allied forces begin the offensive in British Egypt . A command box in the game provides the player with an instant report of a unit or landscape once hovered over ; data given on units includes their strength in terms of supply of infantry , provisions , artillery , and the number of moves that unit can make on one turn . Every two turns lasts one in @-@ game day and units are available to enter combat phases once a day is finished . 
 In a combat phase , the game shifts to an " arcade sequence " , which allows the player to control a tank in the Sahara Desert . The arcade sequence presents a menu of tank functions ; a gun turret , shell loading , firing and navigational buttons . Only one function can be used at a time ; in order to drive the tank , the player has to use the navigational buttons to manoeuvre . If the tank becomes under attack , the gun turret or shell @-@ firing mode must be activated for self @-@ defence . Both the arcade sequence and tank controlling is optional , however , and is not required to finish the game .

 Personal Software Services was founded in Coventry , England , by Gary Mays and Richard Cockayne in 1981 . The company were known for creating games that revolved around historic war battles and conflicts , such as Theatre Europe , Iwo Jima and Falklands ' 82 . The company had a partnership with French video game developer ERE Informatique , and published localised versions of their products to the United Kingdom . In 1986 , Cockayne took a decision to alter their products for release on 16 @-@ bit consoles , as he found that smaller 8 @-@ bit consoles such as the ZX Spectrum lacked the processing power for larger strategy games . The decision was falsely interpreted as " pull @-@ out " from the Spectrum market by a video game journalist . Following years of successful sales throughout the mid 1980s , Personal Software Services experienced financial difficulties , during a period where Cockayne later admitted that he " took his eye off the ball " . The company was acquired by Mirrorsoft in February 1987 , and was later dispossessed by the company due to strains of debt .

 The game received mixed reviews upon release . Richard Blaine of Your Sinclair praised the game 's playability and value for money , stating that it provides an " interesting challenge " . Philippa Irving of Crash , however , criticised the playability and tank mechanics as " stunningly badly designed " and " unplayable " , whilst also stating that it was " rather <unk> " . Gary Rook of Sinclair User summarised that Tobruk was " pretty disappointing " and " nowhere near as successful " as its direct predecessor , Bismarck . Rook criticised the interface of the game as " clumsily " executed and not " half as good " as that of other strategy games at the time of release . Regarding the arcade sequences of the game , Michael Sandford of ZX Computing recommended any player to avoid them , as its difficulty would affect gameplay . However , Sandford praised the overall experience of the game , stating that it was " one of the best " wargames and endorsed it to anybody interested in the genre . 
 Mark Reed of Computer Gamer asserted that Tobruk was " undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable wargames ever " and heralded its originality and playability . Irving , however , criticised its authenticity ; stating that the game was lacking in both " elusive quality " and atmosphere . Rook found that the developers ' intention of attempting to " marry strategy gaming with arcade gaming " was unsuccessful and produced negative results . A 1993 Computer Gaming World survey of wargames agreed while giving the game one @-@ plus stars out of five , stating that " the simulation and arcade aspects denigrate each other 's appeal " . 
 = Cyclone Kalunde = 
 Intense Tropical Cyclone Kalunde was the strongest storm of the 2002 – 03 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season . The eleventh named storm and sixth cyclone of the season , Kalunde formed on March 4 from an area of disturbed weather east @-@ southeast of Diego Garcia . The storm steadily strengthened and attained severe tropical storm intensity on March 6 . After starting a phase of rapid deepening , Kalunde attained cyclone intensity the next day . Kalunde attained its peak intensity on March 8 , as an intense tropical cyclone . It maintained its peak strength for a day ; shortly thereafter , the system began to weaken . After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle , the storm brushed Rodrigues . Shortly after doing so , Kalunde weakened into a tropical cyclone and later a severe tropical storm . Two days later , on March 16 , the cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next day . 
 Cyclone Kalunde brought US $ 3 @.@ 15 million in damage to Rodrigues Island . A total of 1 @,@ 600 homes and 40 boats were damaged . Severe coastal damage took place across the island ; many roads were washed out . Power outages also occurred across the island , delaying residents access to information pertaining to Kalunde . About 80 percent of the drinking water was contaminated and the entire food crop was destroyed . However , no deaths were reported .

 An area of convection developed on March 3 several hundred miles to the east @-@ southeast of Diego Garcia . That day , Météo @-@ France ( MFR ) issued the first bulletin on Tropical Disturbance 14 while located 580 mi ( 930 km ) east @-@ southeast of Diego Garcia . In an environment of weak to moderate wind shear , MFR upgraded the system to tropical depression status . Later on March 4 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) for the disturbance as shower activity increased , though it initially concentrated west @-@ southwest of the atmospheric circulation . MFR upgraded the depression to moderate tropical storm status at 0600 UTC on March 5 ; subsequently , the Meteorological Service of Mauritius assigned the system the name Kalunde . Moving west @-@ northwest , the JTWC issued their first warning on the system . Initially , Kalunde did not become much better organized even though deep convection was still increasing . Cyclone Kalunde steadily intensified over the next couple of days while performing a small clockwise loop . MFR upgraded Kalunde to severe tropical storm status at 1200 UTC on March 6 . At 1800 UTC , JTWC reported 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . On March 7 , Kalunde began to undergo rapid intensification , and at 0600 UTC the MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone . At the same time , JTWC also estimated winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) . 
 After the formation of an eye , Kalunde continued to intensify rapidly and at 1800 UTC March 7 MFR declared the system an intense cyclone . Simultaneously , JTWC estimated that Kalunde had attained winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) while located several hundred miles south @-@ southwest of Diego Garcia . Continuing to trek southwest by a mid @-@ level ridge to the southeast , the rapid intensification trend continued until it leveled off early on March 8 . At this time , the JTWC reported winds of 255 km / h ( 160 mph ) , equivalent to Category 5 intensity on the SSHWS . Subsequently , MFR remarked that the system had reached its peak wind speed of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) , as an intense tropical cyclone . After attaining peak intensity , MFR and the JTWC began to lower their intensity estimates as thunderstorms began to erode in the northwestern quadrant of the eyewall . 
 Moving slowly southwest , Intense Tropical Cyclone Kalunde underwent an eyewall replacement cyclone late on March 9 . The next day , the JTWC notes that Kalunde re @-@ intensified somewhat ; however , this is not supported by MFR ’ s estimates . While slowly approaching the small island of Rodrigues , Kalunde was estimated ( according to MFR ) to have winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . On March 12 , Kalunde passed 55 km ( 35 mi ) away from Rodrigues , and around that time the JTWC reported winds of 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . MFR downgraded Kalunde to severe tropical storm status at 0000 UTC on March 14 . Twelve hours later , the center of circulation became exposed from the convection . Kalunde continued trekking south @-@ southeastward on the March 15 as it underwent extratropical transition . The JTWC stopped monitoring the low at 1200 UTC while estimating winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . At 1800 UTC on March 15 , MFR declared the system extratropical , located approximately 690 mi ( 1 @,@ 110 km ) south @-@ southeast of Rodrigues . The agency officially stopped tracking the system at 1200 UTC the next day though the storm finally dissipated on March 17 .

 Prior to the storm 's arrival , a class four cyclone alert was issued for Rodrigues Island . Between March 11 and 13 , flights to and from Rodrigues were canceled due to high winds . In addition , Cyclone Kalunde briefly posed a threat to Mauritius . 
 Severe coastal damage took place across Rodrigues . Many roads were washed out , isolating many communities . Wind gusts estimated up to 210 km / h ( 130 mph ) destroyed the island 's power and telecommunications grid , leaving the entire populous without power . Communication lines between Rodrigues and nearby Mauritius were also cut . Hospitals were also without electricity ; one operation had to be done using a torch light . Because communication was lost during Kalunde 's passage , residents lacked information about the storm for several hours . About 80 percent of the drinking water was contaminated and food crop on the island was washed away . During the storm 's three @-@ day passage of the island , 329 @.@ 1 mm ( 12 @.@ 96 in ) of rain fell . A total of 1 @,@ 600 homes and 40 boats were damaged and losses across the island amounted to € 3 @.@ 4 million ( US $ 3 @.@ 15 million ) . 
 In the wake of the storm , the French Red Cross supplied 1 @.@ 5 tons of supplies to approximately 10 @,@ 000 people victims of Kalunde . Mauritius Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger visited the island Friday to assess the damage while another official called on Mauritius officials to contribute to a cyclone relief fund for the island group . Twenty technicians were also sent to the area in wake of the storm . Officials estimated that it would take five weeks for power to be fully restored across Rodrigues . They also stated that if a similar situation took place and people were in need of emergency services , no one would be able to receive them . Furthermore , they proposed that bridges would to be built in order to forestall roads from being washed out again . 
 = L 'Orfeo = 
 L 'Orfeo ( SV 318 ) ( Italian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) , sometimes called La favola d 'Orfeo [ la <unk> <unk> ] , is a late Renaissance / early Baroque favola in musica , or opera , by Claudio Monteverdi , with a libretto by Alessandro Striggio . It is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus , and tells the story of his descent to Hades and his fruitless attempt to bring his dead bride Eurydice back to the living world . It was written in 1607 for a court performance during the annual Carnival at Mantua . While Jacopo Peri 's Dafne is generally recognised as the first work in the opera genre , and the earliest surviving opera is Peri 's Euridice , L 'Orfeo is the earliest that is still regularly performed . 
 By the early 17th century the traditional intermedio — a musical sequence between the acts of a straight play — was evolving into the form of a complete musical drama or " opera " . Monteverdi 's L 'Orfeo moved this process out of its experimental era and provided the first fully developed example of the new genre . After its initial performance the work was staged again in Mantua , and possibly in other Italian centres in the next few years . Its score was published by Monteverdi in 1609 and again in 1615 . After the composer 's death in 1643 the opera went unperformed for many years , and was largely forgotten until a revival of interest in the late 19th century led to a spate of modern editions and performances . At first these performances tended to be concert ( <unk> ) versions within institutes and music societies , but following the first modern dramatised performance in Paris , in 1911 , the work began to be seen in theatres . After the Second World War many recordings were issued , and the opera was increasingly staged in opera houses , although some leading venues resisted it . In 2007 the quatercentenary of the premiere was celebrated by performances throughout the world . 
 In his published score Monteverdi lists around 41 instruments to be deployed , with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters . Thus strings , harpsichords and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds , while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens . Composed at the point of transition from the Renaissance era to the Baroque , L 'Orfeo employs all the resources then known within the art of music , with particularly daring use of polyphony . The work is not orchestrated as such ; in the Renaissance tradition instrumentalists followed the composer 's general instructions but were given considerable freedom to improvise . 
 = = Historical background = = 
 Claudio Monteverdi , born in Cremona in 1567 , was a musical prodigy who studied under Marc 'Antonio <unk> , the maestro di cappella ( head of music ) at Cremona Cathedral . After training in singing , strings playing and composition , Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until , in 1590 or 1591 , he secured a post as <unk> di <unk> ( viola player ) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga 's court at Mantua . Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga 's maestro della musica ( master of music ) in 1601 . 
 Vincenzo Gonzaga 's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence . Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio — a long @-@ established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas — into increasingly elaborate forms . Led by Jacopo Corsi , these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera : Dafne , composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598 . This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole . Only fragments of its music still exist , but several other Florentine works of the same period — <unk> di Anima , et di Corpo by Emilio de ' Cavalieri , Peri 's Euridice and Giulio Caccini 's identically titled Euridice — survive complete . These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid 's Metamorphoses , and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi 's L 'Orfeo . 
 The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment . A century before Duke Vincenzo 's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano 's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo , at least half of which was sung rather than spoken . More recently , in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court 's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini 's play Il pastor fido , described by theatre historian Mark Ringer as a " watershed theatrical work " which inspired the Italian craze for pastoral drama . On 6 October 1600 , while visiting Florence for the wedding of Maria de ' Medici to King Henry IV of France , Duke Vincenzo attended a production of Peri 's Euridice . It is likely that his principal musicians , including Monteverdi , were also present at this performance . The Duke quickly recognised the novelty of this new form of dramatic entertainment , and its potential for bringing prestige to those prepared to sponsor it . 
 = = Creation = = 
 = = = Libretto = = = 
 Among those present at the Euridice performance in October 1600 was a young lawyer and career diplomat from Gonzaga 's court , Alessandro Striggio , son of a well @-@ known composer of the same name . The younger Striggio was himself a talented musician ; as a 16 @-@ year @-@ old , he had played the viol at the wedding festivities of Duke Ferdinando of Tuscany in 1589 . Together with Duke Vincent 's two young sons , Francesco and <unk> , he was a member of Mantua 's exclusive intellectual society , the Accademia degli <unk> , which provided the chief outlet for the city 's theatrical works . It is not clear at what point Striggio began his libretto for L 'Orfeo , but work was evidently under way in January 1607 . In a letter written on 5 January , Francesco <unk> asks his brother , then attached to the Florentine court , to obtain the services of a high quality castrato from the Grand Duke 's establishment , for a " play in music " being prepared for the Mantuan Carnival . 
 Striggio 's main sources for his libretto were Books 10 and 11 of Ovid 's Metamorphoses and Book Four of Virgil 's Georgics . These provided him with the basic material , but not the structure for a staged drama ; the events of Acts 1 and 2 of the libretto are covered by a mere 13 lines in the Metamorphoses . For help in creating a dramatic form , Striggio drew on other sources — Poliziano 's 1480 play , Guarini 's Il pastor fido , and Ottavio Rinuccini 's libretto for Peri 's Euridice . Musicologist Gary Tomlinson remarks on the many similarities between Striggio 's and Rinuccini 's texts , noting that some of the speeches in L 'Orfeo " correspond closely in content and even in <unk> to their counterparts in L <unk> " . The critic Barbara <unk> Hanning writes that Striggio 's verses are less subtle than those of Rinuccini , although the structure of Striggio 's libretto is more interesting . Rinuccini , whose work had been written for the festivities accompanying a Medici wedding , was obliged to alter the myth to provide a " happy ending " suitable for the occasion . By contrast , because Striggio was not writing for a formal court celebration he could be more faithful to the spirit of the myth 's conclusion , in which Orfeo is killed and dismembered by deranged <unk> or " Bacchantes " . He chose , in fact , to write a somewhat muted version of this bloody finale , in which the Bacchantes threaten Orfeo 's destruction but his actual fate is left in doubt . 
 The libretto was published in Mantua in 1607 to coincide with the premiere incorporates Striggio 's ambiguous ending . However , Monteverdi 's score published in Venice in 1609 by Ricciardo Amadino shows an entirely different resolution , with Orpheus transported to the heavens through the intervention of Apollo . According to Ringer , Striggio 's original ending was almost certainly used at the opera 's premiere , but there is no doubt that Monteverdi believed the revised ending was aesthetically correct . The musicologist Nino Pirrotta argues that the Apollo ending was part of the original plan for the work , but was not staged at the premiere because the small room which hosted the event could not contain the theatrical machinery that this ending required . The Bacchantes scene was a substitution ; Monteverdi 's intentions were restored when this constraint was removed . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 When Monteverdi composed L 'Orfeo he had a thorough grounding in theatrical music . He had been employed at the Gonzaga court for 16 years , much of it as a performer or arranger of stage music , and in 1604 he had written the ballo Gli <unk> di Diane ed <unk> for the 1604 – 05 Mantua Carnival . The elements from which Monteverdi constructed his first opera score — the aria , the strophic song , recitative , choruses , dances , dramatic musical interludes — were , as conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt has pointed out , not created by him , but " he blended the entire stock of newest and older possibilities into a unity that was indeed new " . Musicologist Robert Donington writes similarly : " [ The score ] contains no element which was not based on precedent , but it reaches complete maturity in that recently @-@ developed form ... Here are words as directly expressed in music as [ the pioneers of opera ] wanted them expressed ; here is music expressing them ... with the full inspiration of genius . " 
 Monteverdi states the orchestral requirements at the beginning of his published score , but in accordance with the practice of the day he does not specify their exact usage . At that time it was usual to allow each interpreter of the work freedom to make local decisions , based on the orchestral forces at their disposal . These could differ sharply from place to place . Furthermore , as Harnoncourt points out , the instrumentalists would all have been composers and would have expected to collaborate creatively at each performance , rather than playing a set text . Another practice of the time was to allow singers to embellish their arias . Monteverdi wrote plain and embellished versions of some arias , such as Orfeo 's " Possente <unk> " , but according to Harnoncourt " it is obvious that where he did not write any embellishments he did not want any sung " . 
 Each act of the opera deals with a single element of the story , and each ends with a chorus . Despite the five @-@ act structure , with two sets of scene changes , it is likely that L 'Orfeo conformed to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity , without intervals or curtain descents between acts . It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience , these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation , key and style . 
 = = = Instrumentation = = = 
 For the purpose of analysis the music scholar Jane Glover has divided Monteverdi 's list of instruments into three main groups : strings , brass and continuo , with a few further items not easily classifiable . The strings grouping is formed from ten members of the violin family ( viole da <unk> ) , two double basses ( <unk> de viola ) , and two small violins ( violini <unk> alla <unk> ) . The viole da <unk> are in two five @-@ part ensembles , each comprising two violins , two violas and a cello . The brass group contains four or five trombones ( <unk> ) , three trumpets and two cornetts . The continuo forces include two harpsichords ( <unk> <unk> ) , a double harp ( <unk> <unk> ) , two or three <unk> , two pipe organs ( <unk> di legno ) , three bass viola da gamba , and a regal or small reed organ . Outside of these groupings are two recorders ( <unk> alla <unk> secunda ) , and possibly one or more <unk> — unlisted by Monteverdi , but included in instructions relating to the end of Act 4 . 
 Instrumentally , the two worlds represented within the opera are distinctively portrayed . The pastoral world of the fields of Thrace is represented by the strings , harpsichords , harp , organs , recorders and <unk> . The remaining instruments , mainly brass , are associated with the Underworld , though there is not an absolute distinction ; strings appear on several occasions in the Hades scenes . Within this general ordering , specific instruments or combinations are used to accompany some of the main characters — Orpheus by harp and organ , shepherds by harpsichord and <unk> , the Underworld gods by trombones and regal . All of these musical distinctions and characterisations were in accordance with the longstanding traditions of the Renaissance orchestra , of which the large L 'Orfeo ensemble is typical . 
 Monteverdi instructs his players generally to " [ play ] the work as simply and correctly as possible , and not with many florid passages or runs " . Those playing ornamentation instruments such as strings and flutes are advised to " play nobly , with much invention and variety " , but are warned against overdoing it , whereby " nothing is heard but chaos and confusion , offensive to the listener . " Since at no time are all the instruments played together , the number of players needed is less than the number of instruments . Harnoncourt indicates that in Monteverdi 's day the numbers of players and singers together , and the small rooms in which performances were held , often meant that the audience barely numbered more than the performers . 
 = = Roles = = 
 In his <unk> listed in the 1609 score , Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera ( the Messenger ) , and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca ( Moorish dance ) at the opera 's end are a separate group ( che <unk> la moresca nel fine ) . Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance . A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part , and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role . Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges " with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling " . The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato , Giovanni <unk> Magli , is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes . Magli sang the prologue , Proserpina and possibly one other role , either La messaggera or Speranza . The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo . 
 A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo . It refers to " that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince 's Orfeo " . This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo <unk> , a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century . The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors , Pandolfo Grande and Francesco <unk> may have sung minor roles in the premiere . 
 There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits . Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows , a total of ten singers — three sopranos , two altos , three tenors and two basses — is required for a performance , with the soloists ( except Orfeo ) also forming the chorus . Carter 's suggested role @-@ doublings include La musica with Euridice , Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza .

 The action takes place in two contrasting locations : the fields of Thrace ( Acts 1 , 2 and 5 ) and the Underworld ( Acts 3 and 4 ) . An instrumental toccata ( English : " <unk> " , meaning a flourish on trumpets ) precedes the entrance of La musica , representing the " spirit of music " , who sings a prologue of five stanzas of verse . After a gracious welcome to the audience she announces that she can , through sweet sounds , " calm every troubled heart . " She sings a further paean to the power of music , before introducing the drama 's main protagonist , Orfeo , who " held the wild beasts spellbound with his song " .

 After La musica 's final request for silence , the curtain rises on Act 1 to reveal a pastoral scene . Orfeo and Euridice enter together with a chorus of nymphs and shepherds , who act in the manner of a Greek chorus , commenting on the action both as a group and as individuals . A shepherd announces that this is the couple 's wedding day ; the chorus responds , first in a stately invocation ( " Come , Hymen , O come " ) and then in a joyful dance ( " Leave the mountains , leave the fountains " ) . Orfeo and Euridice sing of their love for each other before leaving with most of the group for the wedding ceremony in the temple . Those left on stage sing a brief chorus , commenting on how Orfeo used to be one " for whom sighs were food and weeping was drink " before love brought him to a state of sublime happiness . 
 = = = Act 2 = = = 
 Orfeo returns with the main chorus , and sings with them of the beauties of nature . Orfeo then muses on his former unhappiness , but proclaims : " After grief one is more content , after pain one is happier " . The mood of contentment is abruptly ended when La messaggera enters , bringing the news that , while gathering flowers , Euridice has received a fatal snakebite . The chorus expresses its anguish : " Ah , bitter happening , ah , impious and cruel fate ! " , while the <unk> castigates herself as the bearing of bad tidings ( " For ever I will flee , and in a lonely cavern lead a life in keeping with my sorrow " ) . Orfeo , after venting his grief and incredulity ( " Thou art dead , my life , and I am breathing ? " ) , declares his intention to descend into the Underworld and persuade its ruler to allow Euridice to return to life . Otherwise , he says , " I shall remain with thee in the company of death " . He departs , and the chorus resumes its lament .

 Orfeo is guided by Speranza to the gates of Hades . Having pointed out the words inscribed on the gate ( " Abandon hope , all ye who enter here " ) , Speranza leaves . Orfeo is now confronted with the ferryman Caronte , who addresses Orfeo harshly and refuses to take him across the river Styx . Orfeo attempts to persuade Caronte by singing a flattering song to him ( " Mighty spirit and powerful divinity " ) , but the ferryman is unmoved . However , when Orfeo takes up his lyre and plays , Caronte is soothed into sleep . Seizing his chance , Orfeo steals the ferryman 's boat and crosses the river , entering the Underworld while a chorus of spirits reflects that nature cannot defend herself against man : " He has tamed the sea with fragile wood , and disdained the rage of the winds . "

 In the Underworld , Proserpina , Queen of Hades , who has been deeply affected by Orfeo 's singing , petitions King Plutone , her husband , for Euridice 's release . Moved by her pleas , Plutone agrees on the condition that , as he leads Euridice towards the world , Orfeo must not look back . If he does , " a single glance will condemn him to eternal loss " . Orfeo enters , leading Euridice and singing confidently that on that day he will rest on his wife 's white bosom . But as he sings a note of doubt creeps in : " Who will assure me that she is following ? " . Perhaps , he thinks , Plutone , driven by envy , has imposed the condition through spite ? Suddenly distracted by an off @-@ stage commotion , Orfeo looks round ; immediately , the image of Euridice begins to fade . She sings , despairingly : " <unk> thou me through too much love ? " and disappears . Orfeo attempts to follow her but is drawn away by an unseen force . The chorus of spirits sings that Orfeo , having overcome Hades , was in turn overcome by his passions .

 Back in the fields of Thrace , Orfeo has a long soliloquy in which he laments his loss , praises Euridice 's beauty and resolves that his heart will never again be pierced by Cupid 's arrow . An off @-@ stage echo repeats his final phrases . Suddenly , in a cloud , Apollo descends from the heavens and chastises him : " Why dost thou give thyself up as prey to rage and grief ? " He invites Orfeo to leave the world and join him in the heavens , where he will recognise Euridice 's likeness in the stars . Orfeo replies that it would be unworthy not to follow the counsel of such a wise father , and together they ascend . A shepherds ' chorus concludes that " he who sows in suffering shall reap the fruit of every grace " , before the opera ends with a vigorous moresca . 
 = = = Original libretto ending = = = 
 In Striggio 's 1607 libretto , Orfeo 's Act 5 soliloquy is interrupted , not by Apollo 's appearance but by a chorus of <unk> or Bacchantes — wild , drunken women — who sing of the " divine fury " of their master , the god Bacchus . The cause of their wrath is Orfeo and his renunciation of women ; he will not escape their heavenly anger , and the longer he evades them the more severe his fate will be . Orfeo leaves the scene and his destiny is left uncertain , as the Bacchantes devote themselves for the rest of the opera to wild singing and dancing in praise of Bacchus . The early music authority Claude <unk> believes that the two endings are not incompatible ; Orfeo might evade the fury of the Bacchantes and be rescued by Apollo . 
 = = Reception and performance history = = 
 = = = Premiere and early performances = = = 
 The date for the first performance of L 'Orfeo , 24 February 1607 , is evidenced by two letters , both dated 23 February . In the first , Francesco Gonzaga informs his brother that the " musical play " will be performed tomorrow ; it is clear from earlier correspondence that this refers to L 'Orfeo . The second letter is from a Gonzaga court official , Carlo Magno , and gives more details : " Tomorrow evening the Most Serene Lord the Prince is to sponsor a [ play ] in a room in the apartments which the Most Serene Lady had the use of ... it should be most unusual , as all the actors are to sing their parts . " The " Serene Lady " is Duke Vincenzo 's widowed sister Margherita Gonzaga d 'Este , who lived within the Ducal Palace . The room of the premiere cannot be identified with certainty ; according to Ringer , it may have been the Galleria dei <unk> , which has the dimensions to accommodate a stage and orchestra with space for a small audience . 
 There is no detailed account of the premiere , although Francesco wrote on 1 March that the work had " been to the great satisfaction of all who heard it " , and had particularly pleased the Duke . The Mantuan court theologian and poet , Cherubino Ferrari wrote that : " Both poet and musician have depicted the inclinations of the heart so skilfully that it could not have been done better ... The music , observing due propriety , serves the poetry so well that nothing more beautiful is to be heard anywhere " . After the premiere Duke Vincenzo ordered a second performance for 1 March ; a third performance was planned to coincide with a proposed state visit to Mantua by the Duke of Savoy . Francesco wrote to the Duke of Tuscany on 8 March , asking if he could retain the services of the castrato Magli for a little longer . However , the visit was cancelled , as was the celebratory performance . 
 There are suggestions that in the years following the premiere , L 'Orfeo may have been staged in Florence , Cremona , Milan and Turin , though firmer evidence suggests that the work attracted limited interest beyond the Mantuan court . Francesco may have mounted a production in Casale Monferrato , where he was governor , for the 1609 – 10 Carnival , and there are indications that the work was performed on several occasions in Salzburg between 1614 and 1619 , under the direction of Francesco Rasi . Years later , during the first flourish of Venetian opera in 1637 – 43 , Monteverdi chose to revive his second opera , L 'Arianna there , but not L 'Orfeo . There is some evidence of performances shortly after Monteverdi 's death : in Geneva in 1643 , and in Paris , at the Louvre , in 1647 . Although according to Carter the work was still admired across Italy in the 1650s , it was subsequently forgotten , as largely was Monteverdi , until the revival of interest in his works in the late 19th century . 
 = = = 20th @-@ century revivals = = = 
 After years of neglect , Monteverdi 's music began to attract the interest of pioneer music historians in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , and from the second quarter of the 19th century onwards he is discussed increasingly in scholarly works . In 1881 a truncated version of the L 'Orfeo score , intended for study rather than performance , was published in Berlin by Robert Eitner . In 1904 the composer Vincent d 'Indy produced an edition in French , which comprised only Act 2 , a shortened Act 3 and Act 4 . This edition was the basis of the first public performance of the work in two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half centuries , a concert performance at d 'Indy 's Schola Cantorum on 25 February 1904 . The distinguished writer Romain Rolland , who was present , commended d 'Indy for bringing the opera to life and returning it " to the beauty it once had , freeing it from the clumsy restorations which have disfigured it " — presumably a reference to Eitner 's edition . The d 'Indy edition was also the basis of the first modern staged performance of the work , at the Théâtre <unk> , Paris , on 2 May 1911 . 
 An edition of the score by the minor Italian composer Giovanni <unk> received several concert performances in Italy and elsewhere before and after the First World War . This edition was the basis of the opera 's United States debut , another concert performance at the New York Met in April 1912 . The opera was introduced to London , in d 'Indy 's edition , when it was sung to piano accompaniment at the Institut Français on 8 March 1924 . The first British staged performance , with only small cuts , was given by the Oxford University Operatic Society on 7 December 1925 , using an edition prepared for the event by Jack Westrup . In the London Saturday Review , music critic Dyneley Hussey called the occasion " one of the most important events of recent years " ; the production had " indicated at once Monteverdi 's claim to rank among the great geniuses who have written dramatic music " . Westrup 's edition was revived in London at the Scala Theatre in December 1929 , the same year in which the opera received its first US staged performance , at Smith College , Northampton , Massachusetts . The three Scala performances resulted in a financial disaster , and the opera was not seen again in Britain for 35 years . 
 Among a flurry of revivals after 1945 was Paul Hindemith 's edition , a full period reconstruction of the work prepared in 1943 , which was staged and recorded at the Vienna Festival in 1954 . This performance had a great impact on the young Nikolaus Harnoncourt , and was hailed as a masterpiece of scholarship and integrity . The first staged New York performance , by the New York City Opera under Leopold Stokowski on 29 September 1960 , saw the American operatic debut of Gérard <unk> , one of several baritones who have sung the role of Orfeo . The theatre was criticised by New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg because , to accommodate a performance of Luigi Dallapiccola 's contemporary opera Il <unk> , about a third of L 'Orfeo was cut . Schonberg wrote : " Even the biggest aria in the opera , " Possente <unk> " , has a good @-@ sized slash in the middle ... [ L 'Orfeo ] is long enough , and important enough , not to mention beautiful enough , to have been the entire evening 's opera . " 
 By the latter part of the 20th century the opera was being shown all over the world . In 1965 , Sadler 's Wells , forerunner of English National Opera ( ENO ) , staged the first of many ENO presentations which would continue into the 21st century . Among various celebrations marking the opera 's 400th anniversary in 2007 were a semi @-@ staged performance at the Teatro <unk> in Mantua , a full @-@ scale production by the English Bach Festival ( <unk> ) at the Whitehall Banqueting House in London on 7 February , and an unconventional production by <unk> Opera in Cooperstown , New York , conducted by Antony Walker and directed by Christopher Alden . On 6 May 2010 the BBC broadcast a performance of the opera from La Scala , Milan . Despite the reluctance of some major opera houses to stage L 'Orfeo , it is a popular work with the leading Baroque ensembles . During the period 2008 – 10 the French @-@ based Les Arts Florissants , under its director William Christie , has presented the Monteverdi trilogy of operas ( L 'Orfeo , Il ritorno d 'Ulisse and L 'incoronazione di Poppea ) in a series of performances at the Teatro Real in Madrid . 
 = = Music = = 
 L 'Orfeo is , in Redlich 's analysis , the product of two musical epochs . It combines elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century with those of the emerging Florentine mode , in particular the use of recitative and <unk> singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors . In this new style , the text dominates the music ; while sinfonias and instrumental <unk> illustrate the action , the audience 's attention is always drawn primarily to the words . The singers are required to do more than produce pleasant vocal sounds ; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions . 
 <unk> 's recitative style was influenced by Peri 's , in Euridice , although in L 'Orfeo recitative is less preponderant than was usual in dramatic music at this time . It accounts for less than a quarter of the first act 's music , around a third of the second and third acts , and a little under half in the final two acts . 
 The importance of L 'Orfeo is not that it was the first work of its kind , but that it was the first attempt to apply the full resources of the art of music , as then evolved , to the nascent genre of opera . In particular , Monteverdi made daring innovations in the use of polyphony , of which Palestrina had been the principal exponent . In L 'Orfeo , Monteverdi extends the rules , beyond the conventions which polyphonic composers , faithful to Palestrina , had previously considered as sacrosanct . Monteverdi was not in the generally understood sense an orchestrator ; Ringer finds that it is the element of instrumental improvisation that makes each performance of a Monteverdi opera a " unique experience , and separates his work from the later operatic canon . " 
 The opera begins with a martial @-@ sounding toccata for trumpets which is repeated twice . When played on period wind instruments the sound can be startling to modern audiences ; Redlich calls it " shattering " . Such flourishes were the standard signal for the commencement of performances at the Mantuan court ; the opening chorus of Monteverdi 's 1610 Vespers , also composed for Gonzaga 's court , employs the same fanfare . The toccata acted as a salute to the Duke ; according to Donington , if it had not been written , precedent would have required it to be improvised . As the brass sound of the toccata fades , it is replaced by the gentler tone of the strings ritornello which introduces La musica 's prologue . The ritornello is repeated in shortened form between each of the prologue 's five verses , and in full after the final verse . Its function within the opera as a whole is to represent the " power of music " ; as such it is heard at the end of Act 2 , and again at the beginning of Act 5 , one of the earliest examples of an operatic leitmotiv . It is temporally structured as a palindrome and its form of strophic variations allows Monteverdi to carefully shape musical time for expressive and structural purposes in the context of seconda <unk> . 
 After the Prologue , Act 1 follows in the form of a pastoral idyll . Two choruses , one solemn and one jovial are repeated in reverse order around the central love @-@ song " Rosa del ciel " ( " Rose of the heavens " ) , followed by the shepherds ' songs of praise . The buoyant mood continues into Act 2 , with song and dance music influenced , according to Harnoncourt , by Monteverdi 's experience of French music . The sudden entrance of La messaggera with the doleful news of Euridice 's death , and the confusion and grief which follow , are musically reflected by harsh dissonances and the juxtaposition of keys . The music remains in this vein until the act ends with La musica 's ritornello , a hint that the " power of music " may yet bring about a triumph over death . Monteverdi 's instructions as the act concludes are that the violins , the organ and harpsichord become silent and that the music is taken up by the trombones , the cornetts and the regal , as the scene changes to the Underworld . 
 The centrepiece of Act 3 , perhaps of the entire opera , is Orfeo 's extended aria " Possente <unk> e <unk> <unk> " ( " Mighty spirit and powerful divinity " ) , by which he attempts to persuade Caronte to allow him to enter Hades . Monteverdi 's vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Carter describes as " one of the most compelling visual and aural representations " in early opera . Instrumental colour is provided by a <unk> , a pipe @-@ organ , two violins , two cornetts and a double @-@ harp . This array , according to music historian and analyst John <unk> , is intended to suggest that Orfeo is harnessing all the available forces of music to support his plea . In Act 4 the impersonal coldness of the Underworld is broken by the warmth of Proserpina 's singing on behalf of Orfeo , a warmth that is retained until the dramatic moment at which Orfeo " looks back " . The cold sounds of the sinfonia from the beginning of Act 3 then remind us that the Underworld is , after all , entirely devoid of human feeling . The brief final act , which sees Orfeo 's rescue and metamorphosis , is framed by the final appearance of La musica 's ritornello and the lively moresca that ends the opera . This dance , says Ringer , recalls the jigs danced at the end of Shakespeare 's tragedies , and provides a means of bringing the audience back to their everyday world , " just as the toccata had led them into another realm some two hours before . The toccata and the moresca unite courtly reality with operatic illusion . " 
 = = Recording history = = 
 The first recording of L 'Orfeo was issued in 1939 , a freely adapted version of Monteverdi 's music by Giacomo <unk> , given by the orchestra of La Scala Milan conducted by Ferrucio <unk> . In 1949 , for the recording of the complete opera by the Berlin Radio Orchestra under Helmut Koch , the new medium of long @-@ playing records ( LPs ) was used . The advent of LP recordings was , as Harold C. Schonberg later wrote , an important factor in the postwar revival of interest in Renaissance and Baroque music , and from the mid @-@ 1950s recordings of L 'Orfeo have been issued on many labels . The 1969 recording by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the Vienna Concentus Musicus , using Harnoncourt 's edition based on period instruments , was praised for " making Monteverdi 's music sound something like the way he imagined " . In 1981 Siegfried Heinrich , with the Early Music Studio of the Hesse Chamber Orchestra , recorded a version which re @-@ created the original Striggio libretto ending , adding music from Monteverdi 's 1616 ballet <unk> e <unk> for the Bacchante scenes . Among more recent recordings , that of Emmanuelle Haïm in 2004 has been praised for its dramatic effect . 
 = = Editions = = 
 After the publication of the L 'Orfeo score in 1609 , the same publisher ( Ricciardo Amadino of Venice ) brought it out again in 1615 . Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively . Since Eitner 's first " modern " edition of L 'Orfeo in 1884 , and d 'Indy 's performing edition 20 years later — both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score — there have been many attempts to edit and present the work , not all of them published . Most of the editions that followed d 'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements , usually heavily truncated , that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom . Many of these were the work of composers , including Carl Orff ( 1923 and 1939 ) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935 . Orff 's 1923 score , using a German text , included some period instrumentation , an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version . 
 In the post @-@ war period , editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi 's day . This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions , that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances , and Gian Francesco Malipiero 's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi 's 1609 original . After the war , Hindemith 's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August <unk> that remained in use for many years . The next 30 years saw numerous editions , mostly prepared by scholar @-@ performers rather than by composers , generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re @-@ creation of the original instrumentation . These included versions by Raymond Leppard ( 1965 ) , Denis Stevens ( 1967 ) , Nikolaus Harnoncourt ( 1969 ) , Jane Glover ( 1975 ) , Roger Norrington ( 1976 ) and John Eliot Gardiner . Only the composers Valentino <unk> ( 1967 ) , Bruno Maderna ( 1967 ) and Luciano Berio ( 1984 ) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra . In the 21st century editions continue to be produced , often for use in conjunction with a particular performance or recording .

It was also her first tour in eight years , following The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993 . The tour was supposed to start in 1999 , but was delayed until 2001 as Madonna gave birth to her son Rocco , got married to Guy Ritchie , was working on Music , and was busy filming The Next Best Thing . When the tour was decided , Madonna appointed Jamie King as choreographer and the tour was planned in a short timespan of three months , including signing up the dancers , musicians , and technicians .

 The set list for the show consisted mainly of songs from Madonna 's albums Ray of Light and Music . Among her pre @-@ 1990s hits , only " Holiday " and " La Isla Bonita " were added to the set list . The show was divided into five sections : Cyber @-@ Punk , Geisha , Cowgirl , Spanish , and Ghetto . It began with a performance of " Drowned World / Substitute For Love " ; Madonna entered the stage as dry ice smoke billowed . She sang the song standing on the middle platform of the stage . Afterwards a chaotic cyberpunk @-@ themed performance of " Impressive Instant " started , with dancers in gas masks and headlights . She then played guitar for " Candy Perfume Girl " , leading to the performance of " Beautiful Stranger " featuring a lost stage technician . Backdrops displayed scenes from the movie Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me . The first section finished with " Ray of Light " where Madonna danced energetically across the stage . 
 The second segment opened with a video interlude of " Paradise ( Not for Me ) " and had nearly naked dancers hanging upside down from the ceiling . As the video ended , the dancers stood in front of the stage opening their mouth which was lit from inside . Madonna appeared on the stage wearing a short black wig and a hand @-@ painted kimono with fifty @-@ two @-@ feet long sleeves , to sing " Frozen " . The backdrops displayed silhouettes of burning trees against blood @-@ red clouds . A short intro of " Open Your Heart " lead to " Nobody 's Perfect " where Madonna enacted being sacrificed for her sins . This was followed by " Mer Girl " which turned into the fast @-@ action , ninja @-@ samurai martial arts battle performance of " Sky Fits Heaven " , changing back into the slow @-@ tempo " Mer Girl " . This section was inspired by the Chinese film Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ( 2000 ) . Madonna 's battered and bruised face was shown in the backdrops as she emerged with a shotgun from the battle on stage and shot her dancer . Madonna disappeared into the floor and a dance remix interlude of " What It Feels Like for a Girl " was shown , featuring footage from the violent , sexually explicit Japanese Anime Film Perfect Blue . 
 For the third segment , Madonna appeared as a cowgirl , wearing a stars @-@ and @-@ stripes vest , for an acoustic guitar performance of " I Deserve It " and dedicated it to her then @-@ husband , Ritchie . This was followed by line dancing with her dancers dressed as cowboys for " Don 't Tell Me " . For " Human Nature " , Madonna rode a mechanical bull . After the performance , she addressed the audience in a mocking southern accent and sang a macabre themed song titled " The Funny Song " . " Secret " featured scenes of riverside baptism , Sufi dervish ceremonies , and Buddhist prayers in the backdrops . She finished off the segment with " Gone " . Dancers started the Evita tango interlude of " Don 't Cry for Me , Argentina " and Madonna appeared and performed the Spanish version of " What it Feels Like For a Girl " , titled " Lo Que Siente La Mujer " . She finished the segment with an acoustic version of " La Isla Bonita " accompanied by flamenco dancing .

According to Orlando Sentinel 's Ben Wener , Drowned World Tour 2001 was " the same eye @-@ popping show aired this past summer on HBO , only with vastly superior sound and sparkling picture " . A reviewer from DVD.net gave the video a rating of six on ten , and the audio a nine on ten . The reviewer praised the DVD saying that " this is a quality release that highlights a performer well and truly on top of her game and for what it 's worth , she is probably among the best at what she does . " 
 Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website complained about its lack of sharpness and commented , " Frankly , I 'm at a loss to understand how such an unattractive video hit the shelves " . He also criticized the lack of extra content , but complimented the DVD 's sound . Jacobson gave the release 's image , sound and extras ratings of D + , A- , D , respectively . Aaron <unk> from DVD Talk website shared Jacobson 's views , saying that it was " a wonderful show from Madonna and I can only imagine what it was like to actually be there . As for the DVD , it offers outstanding audio quality , but only so @-@ so image quality . Still , it 's a terrific show and the DVD still certainly gets a recommendation . " 
 The HBO broadcast won the Best TV Concert category at the 2002 AOL TV Viewer Awards . In January 2002 , it was reported by Billboard that Drowned World Tour 2001 was deemed " too explicit " for Singapore and banned from release there . The Singapore Board of Film Censors , known as Media Development Authority ( MDA ) , took offence with two scenes during the " What It Feels Like for a Girl " interlude , in particular Japanese @-@ inspired animation sequences that depicted a monster fondling and raping an Asian girl . Madonna 's management debated whether to release an edited version of the video album in the region .

Held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 , the Games featured about 3 @,@ 600 athletes aged 14 – 18 from 205 nations , who competed in 201 events in 26 sports . No official medal tables were published , but the most successful nation was China , followed by Russia ; hosts Singapore did not win any gold medals . Most unique features of the YOG , such as mixed @-@ NOCs teams ( comprising youths from different countries ) and the Culture and Education Programme ( CEP ) , made their debut at the 2010 Games . 
 Although the concept dates back to 1998 , formal plans for the YOG were only announced at the 119th IOC session on 6 July 2007 . On 21 February 2008 , Singapore was selected as the host city after defeating Moscow 53 @-@ 44 in a postal vote by 105 International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) members . The Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee ( SYOGOC ) prepared eighteen competition venues and twelve training venues . The Float @ Marina Bay hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and the Youth Olympic Village was located at Nanyang Technological University ( NTU ) . The committee also selected Games mascots Lyo and Merly ( a lion and a female <unk> ) , the Spirit of Youth emblem ( through a design competition ) and the theme song " Everyone " ( performed by five singers , each representing a major continent ( combining North and South America ) ) . 
 Online media , Asian newspapers and 166 television broadcasters provided extensive coverage of the Games . The torch relay , which began on 23 July 2010 , comprised a thirteen @-@ day world tour of five cities , each representing a continent , and a six @-@ day domestic leg . Highlights of the opening and closing ceremonies include performances about Singaporean history and culture , a 32 @-@ metre ( 35 yd ) Olympic cauldron , flags being brought onto stage and items featuring YOG symbols .

 The concept of the YOG was developed in 1998 by Johann Rosenzopf in response to concerns over childhood obesity and declining youth participation in sports . IOC President Jacques Rogge formally announced plans for the YOG at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City on 6 July 2007 . Singapore , which had hosted the 117th session , made its first formal bid to host a multi @-@ disciplinary sporting event of this magnitude . Positive factors in its bid included its high connectivity with the world , its youthfulness as an independent country , and its positive reputation for excellence and multiracial harmony . The city @-@ state rolled out a high @-@ publicity campaign which included being amongst the first to launch its official website , bid logo ( despite IOC rules against bid logos ) and a bid tagline " Blazing the Trail " on 16 October 2007 . It also got the local population to support its bid , including an effort by students to collect 1 million signatures . 
 Eleven cities expressed interest in hosting the Games , nine of which ultimately applied . Five cities amongst the nine were selected for the shortlist : Athens ( Greece ) , Bangkok ( Thailand ) , Moscow ( Russia ) , Singapore , and Turin ( Italy ) . The list was further shortened to two finalists , Singapore and Moscow . On 21 February 2008 , Rogge announced that Singapore had won the postal vote 53 @-@ 44 and was thus selected as the host for the Games . 
 There were concerns over whether two new venues that had been planned – a Youth Olympic Village and an equestrian complex – would be ready in time for the Games . A construction expert believed the US $ 423 million plan for an Olympic Village at the National University of Singapore ( NUS ) was feasible , and that the equestrian venue could be delivered on time . In spite of the expert 's findings , the Youth Olympic Village at the NUS 's University Town did run into difficulties owing to increasing construction costs . It was subsequently decided that existing student halls of residence at Nanyang Technological University in Jurong West would be used for the Olympic Village .

The budget was later increased to U $ 284 million ( S $ 387 million ) , thrice the original amount , which the organisers attributed to major revisions in the scope and scale of the Games . Costs were increased for logistics and transport , security , and upgrades of various sports venues and technology . Financially , local companies received about 70 % , or S $ 260 million , worth of contracts from the Games . Concerns over cost overruns were dismissed by SYOGOC Chairman Ng Ser Miang . The cost overruns was to become an issue that was raised by opposition parties during Singapore 's 2011 general elections .

 Plans for the Youth Olympic torch relay , dubbed the Journey of the Youth Olympic Flame ( <unk> ) , were unveiled on 26 January 2010 . The torch used was 60 cm ( 24 in ) high , 5 to 8 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) wide , and weighed 0 @.@ 74 kg ( 1 @.@ 6 lb ) . The flame was lit at Olympia in Greece on 23 July 2010 and travelled to five cities representing the continents Asia , Africa , Europe , Oceania and the Americas . The relay travelled through the following cities , dubbed the " Celebration Cities " : 
 Berlin , Germany 
 Dakar , Senegal 
 Mexico City , Mexico 
 Auckland , New Zealand 
 Seoul , South Korea 
 After spending 13 days on its world tour , the torch relay continued for another six days in Singapore . A portable cauldron at the Marina Bay Promenade was lit by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on 13 August at the end of the torch relay in Singapore .

 The calendar of the Games was as follows : 
 = = Opening ceremony = = 
 The opening ceremony of the Games was held on 14 August at The Float @ Marina Bay , a floating stage near downtown Singapore . Approximately 27 @,@ 000 spectators attended the event , which took place against a backdrop of the city 's skyline . Event tickets cost between S $ 30 and S $ 200 . The show , the largest ever held by the city , involved over 750 hours of rehearsals . Over 7 @,@ 000 performers , mostly under the age of 18 , took part in the ceremony . At the centre of the stage was the 32 @-@ metre ( 35 yd ) tall Olympic cauldron designed by Randy Chan as a lighthouse . It was flanked by six giant LED displays , which stood behind a reflecting pool containing 200 t ( 7 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 oz ) of water . Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong was present at the event . 
 Following pre @-@ show warm @-@ up and a countdown led by children and young drummers , the show began proper at 20 : 10 hrs ( UTC + 8 ) — a reference to the year of the event — with a fireworks show , followed by a cultural segment titled " Selamat <unk> " that featured Chinese , Malay and Indian performers . The segment ended with performances by homegrown artistes of Eurasian and Peranakan heritage , symbolising the mixture of tradition and modernity in Singapore . Audience members were greeted with pre @-@ recorded messages from several Olympic ambassadors : Olympians Usain Bolt , Michael Phelps and Yelena Isinbayeva , members of the band Thirty Seconds to Mars , and actors Jackie Chan and Jet Li . The flag of Singapore entered the stage with the <unk> Military Band , who had won the Display Band of the Year Award and Best Drum Major of the Year Award in the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging Display Band Competition 2010 , performing " Five Stars Arising " , and the national anthem while the flag was raised . 
 During the " Origins " segment on the city 's history , performers entered the stage in freight containers to depict the arrival of the earliest immigrants . The ceremony continued with a dance performance featuring popular songs from the 1940s to the present era . A segment entitled " Monster " told the story of a young boxer who had to fight a giant monster . He summons his Silat warriors to fight against the monster , but they failed , as well as when he summons his Kalari warriors and Wushu warriors . But soon he overcome his inner fears and defeat the giant monster . Singer Seah Wei Wen then performed " Across The Finish Line " composed by <unk> Omar & Mathilda D Silva , in the centre of the reflecting pool . It was followed by " Playing with Fire " , which featured the dragon as a symbol of courage , strength and wisdom . In this segment , 500 youth from Soka Gakkai participate to form from many fishes into a dragon . Reflecting the theme of global co @-@ operation , members of the World Youth Orchestra of the Singapore Games performed an orchestral piece featuring various instruments from around the world . The orchestra was led by Darrell Ang , the young associate conductor of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra . The following segment , titled " Bud " , depicted rain as a symbol of hope and rejuvenation . Ending the show segment of the ceremony were singers Marcus Lee of Ex @-@ Dee and Lian Kim Selby , performing the song " A New Story " , which was commissioned for the event . Their performance was accompanied by a fashion show organized by students from LASALLE College of the Arts . 
 Each flag of the National Olympic Committees represented was brought on stage by an athlete representative . Following Olympic tradition , the flag of Greece entered first as the originator of the games , and the flag of Singapore entered last as the host nation . The flag ceremony was followed by the singing of the Games theme song and remarks by Ng Ser Miang , Chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee , and Jacques Rogge , President of the International Olympic Committee . The Singapore Games were then officially declared opened by S.R. Nathan , the President of Singapore . The Olympic flag was brought on stage by eight Olympians — Tan Howe Liang , Yelena Isinbayeva , Yang Yang , Tan Eng Liang , Frankie Fredericks , Patricia Chan , Tao Li and Sergey Bubka — and handed to eight Singaporean youth athletes before it was raised with the singing of the Olympic Hymn in Greek by the Singaporean singers . The Olympic Oath was taken on behalf of all athletes by Caroline Pei Jia Chew , on behalf of all judges by Syed Abdul Kadir , and on behalf of all coaches by David Lim Fong Jock . Finally , a boat in the shape of a phoenix carried the Youth Olympic Flame across Marina Bay and was passed between six Singaporean youth athletes in a relay . Sailor Darren Choy was the final torchbearer and lit the cauldron . 
 The 32 @-@ metre ( 105 ft ) tall cauldron was designed by Dr. Tsai Her @-@ Mann , a fellow and resident inventor of the Singapore Science Centre . Designed to look like a lighthouse , its distinctive feature was a swirling 8 m ( 26 ft ) column of fire dubbed the " vortex flame " or " fire tornado " inside a tube with an opening at the top end . Hot air that could reach 300 ° C ( 572 ° F ) created around the flame rose , drawing cool air upwards from openings in the base of the tower . Just below the glass @-@ panelled portion of the tower , the cool air was driven through angled guide vanes , thus creating the spiralling movement travelling upwards at 20 m / s ( 66 ft / s ) . The cauldron , which had been patented in Singapore and the United States , consumed about 2 MW ( 2 @,@ 700 hp ) of fuel , less than half the amount used by conventional Olympic cauldrons . Dr. Tsai said he hoped his design could be used for other Olympic events in future . The cauldron was secretly tested at 4 : 00 am during the two months leading up to the opening ceremony . 
 = = Sports = = 
 The Games featured 26 sports with a total of 31 disciplines and 201 events . These included two disciplines under the IOC classification of aquatics ( diving and swimming ) , and three under gymnastics ( artistic , rhythmic and trampoline ) . Each sport in the Games was represented by a pictogram inspired by the official " Spirit of Youth " emblem consisting of a red flame , a blue star and a green crescent , which was depicted participating in each of the 26 sports of the Youth Olympic Games . The sport pictograms had a distinctive , contemporary graphic style that was intended to make them a highly recognisable feature of the Games . The list of sports is as follows : 
 About 3 @,@ 600 athletes , aged 14 to 18 , participated in the Games . All 205 National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) were represented , except Kuwait , which was suspended in January 2010 due to alleged government interference ; however , three Kuwaiti athletes competed under the Olympic flag . A unique feature of the YOG was the creation of the mixed @-@ NOCs team event . To foster friendship among participants , teams were formed by athletes from different countries to compete on an intercontinental basis . Mixed @-@ NOC sports included equestrian @-@ jumping , fencing , judo , modern pentathlon , and triathlon . There were eight events which composed entirely of mixed @-@ NOCs teams , and as such all 25 medals in these events , including two bronzes in judo , were swept by mixed @-@ NOCs teams . 
 The first gold medal of the Games was awarded to 18 @-@ year @-@ old Japanese triathlete Yuka Sato , who won the girls ' event on 15 August . Host nation Singapore 's first medal was a bronze in taekwondo for Daryl Tan on 16 August . The first gold medal for a mixed @-@ NOC event was awarded to team Europe 1 , consisting of Yana <unk> of Russia and Italians Marco <unk> Marco , Camilla Mancini , Leonardo <unk> , Alberta <unk> Alberta and Eduardo <unk> , which won the team competition in fencing . 
 Although the SYOGOC did not keep an official medal tally , news outlets , such as <unk> , kept unofficial medal tables , where medals won by mixed @-@ NOCs teams are credited to the NOCs that the athletes belong to . The following table lists the top ten ranked NOCs and the host nation . See 2010 Summer Youth Olympics medal table for more details and a full table with medals won by mixed @-@ NOCs teams counted separately .

 = = Culture and Education Programme = = 
 The IOC set a vision for the YOG to be an event comprising a balance of sports , culture and education . The objective of the Culture and Education Programme ( CEP ) that athletes participated in was to educate , engage and influence the athletes to develop true sportsmanship and to live by the Olympic values of excellence , respect and friendship , while having fun at the same time . 
 To promote cultural education among the participating youths , the YOG programme incorporated live youth performances , art installations and festivals revolving around the Olympics spirit and cultural diversity . A wide range of activities took place , such as hands @-@ on workshops , talks by Olympians , outdoor activities , community projects and exhibition booths , all based on five themes : 
 Olympism – the origins , philosophy , structure and evolution of the modern Olympics . 
 Skills development – the different aspects of a professional athletic career , such as personal development , career options and management of transitions in life . 
 Well @-@ being and healthy lifestyle – healthy eating , stress management and risks in sport such as doping . 
 Social responsibility – being a responsible global citizen by caring for the environment and promoting sustainable development and community relations . 
 Expression – interacting with and learning from fellow athletes through digital media and evening festivals at the Youth Olympic Village . 
 Singapore 's Youth Olympic Games Learning Centre is located at the SYOGOC headquarters along Kay Siang Road . It was officially opened by the <unk> President Teo Chee Hean and former pole vaulting champion Sergei Bubka on 30 October 2008 . The two @-@ storey , 600 @-@ square @-@ metre ( 6 @,@ 500 sq ft ) facility was open to the public for free allow visitors to discover and experience the spirit of the Olympics and trace Singapore 's Games journey from winning the bid to host the first YOG in 2010 . It featured several sections aimed at educating the public about different sports , as well as the history of Olympic records and the events lined up for the YOG . The public could also try their hand at table tennis , fencing and basketball at interactive sections . It subsequently closed for renovations from 18 August till the end of 2010 . 
 = = Closing ceremony = = 
 The closing ceremony of the Games was held on 26 August at The Float @ Marina Bay . The show began proper at 8pm Singapore time with youths , cheerleaders and the YOG mascots Lyo and Merly dancing to a medley of " Fame " and " Fight for This Love " . Following the arrival of IOC President Jacques Rogge and Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong , 12 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> Ong led the choir and the audience in singing the national anthem of Singapore . In the next segment " Blazing the Trail " , 5 young singers performed an upbeat song while students dressed to resemble the " Spirit of Youth " , the Singapore 2010 emblem , performed a mass display item . Following the item , the athletes and the flags representing all competing nations made their way onto the floating platform . A short clip showing the highlights of the games was then shown on the LED screens on the stage , accompanied by singer <unk> @-@ Ann <unk> Fernandez and a trio of musicians performing " A New Story " . 
 The Protocol segment followed the performances . A tribute was made to the 20 @,@ 000 volunteers who participated in the Games , with Singapore swimmer Rainer Ng making a short speech thanking the volunteers and eight other athletes presenting bouquets to eight representative volunteers . This was then followed by speeches from Ng Ser Miang , Chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee , and Jacques Rogge , IOC President , with Mr. Rogge officially declaring the Games closed in accordance with tradition . The Olympic flag was then lowered with the singing of the Olympic Anthem . In the handover ceremony , the Olympic flag was handed over from Teo Ser Luck , acting as the Mayor of Singapore , through Jacques Rogge , to Ji Jianye , Mayor of Nanjing , China , the host city of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics . The national anthem of China was then played with the raising of China 's flag , and a short video presentation showcasing Nanjing followed . The Youth Olympic Flame was then finally extinguished to the sounds of a flugelhorn . A Celebration Concert marked the end of the show with songs and performances from local artistes . 
 = = Media coverage = = 
 The Games organisers used online media to market the event , including <unk> , Facebook , Twitter , WordPress and the official <unk> 2010 discussion forum . Contracts were signed with 166 broadcasters to provide worldwide television broadcasts for the Games . These include China Central Television , which telecast the opening ceremony live and has been screening nine hours of coverage each day on its CCTV @-@ 5 sports channel , and the Universal Sports television network in the United States . Most print media coverage was by Asian newspapers and news agencies such as the China Youth Daily , Guangzhou Daily , Nanjing Daily and People 's Daily and the Xinhua News Agency from China ; the Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun from Japan ; and the China Times and United Daily News and the Central News Agency from Taiwan ; though Australian newspapers ran brief news items , results and pictures , and the British press followed events due to interest generated by the forthcoming 2012 Summer Olympics in London . In Canada , the games were broadcast by Canada 's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium , a joint venture between CTVglobemedia and Rogers Media . Coverage of those games was limited to a one @-@ hour daily highlights package on Sportsnet and TSN2 ( rebroadcast several weeks later on TSN ) . The consortium does not , however , own rights to the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics in Innsbruck .

 = = = Attendance = = = 
 The International Herald Tribune claimed in a 16 August 2010 article that ticket sales to events had been " sluggish " despite an expensive government campaign featuring billboards around Singapore to encourage neighbourhoods to celebrate the event , and that there had been reports that children had been " forced " to attend pre @-@ Games events . The latter was denied by organisers , SYOGOC Chairman Ng Ser Miang saying : " [ J ] ust look at the faces of the children that are there , the sparkle in their eyes and the smiles on their faces . Those are not things you can force . " 
 Members of the public commented that although some events were sold out , there appeared to be many unoccupied seats at venues , and claimed that this was because the Ministry of Education ( MOE ) made a block purchase of 87 @,@ 000 passes to be given to schools . However , students usually did not stay for the full duration of sessions , which can be up to seven hours long . The MOE denied that students were to blame , stating that more than 95 % of students allocated tickets had attended events , and that some schools had asked to purchase additional tickets due to overwhelming demand . The SYOGOC announced that once sessions had begun , unoccupied seats would be resold to people who turned up in person at venues . To enable venue managers to gauge the number of seats available for resale , teachers escorting students to events were instructed to inform venue managers if they intended to leave before sessions ended and the number of seats occupied by students . On 20 August , the organisers reported that tickets were sold out for all 26 sports except girls ' football . 
 Controversy also arose from the YOG attendance policy in Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School , a local primary school . The school stated that a S $ 5 refundable deposit was required from students who attend the YOG events on a non @-@ school day . The principal , Clifford Chua , said that it was to " ensure that our children learn the value of responsibility and not take this rare opportunity for granted , by wasting the ticket and depriving others of the chance " . Also , the deposit was returned even if the child did not attend the event . However , the move garnered mixed reactions from parents , who either supported the idea or felt it was not the right way to do things . Some other schools such as Nanyang Girls High School , Bukit View Primary School and Park View Primary School gave free tickets to their students while Anglo @-@ Chinese School ( Primary ) encouraged co @-@ pay of $ 1 to $ 2 by the students to teach them to treasure their tickets .

 On 16 August 2010 , Iranian officials withdrew Mohammed Soleimani from the men 's under @-@ 48 @-@ kilogram category taekwondo final against Israel 's Gili <unk> , citing an ankle injury . According to the officials , Soleimani had first hurt his ankle at the World Junior Championships in Mexico earlier in the year , and the injury had flared up again during his semifinal contest against the US 's Gregory English . Soleimani was sent to hospital for an X @-@ ray , and his ankle was put into a cast . <unk> was awarded the gold medal by default at a victory ceremony at the Suntec International Convention Centre from which Soleimani , the silver medallist , was absent . Interviewed later on , Soleimani said he was " very sad " to have missed the bout as he was " sure [ he ] was going to get the gold medal " . Israel 's chef @-@ de @-@ mission Daniel Oren claimed that the pullout had been politically motivated . He said : " It 's not the first time this has happened at the Olympics . But this is a first for a medal match . To be honest , once our boy got into the final , we knew that this is going to happen . I spoke to our boy after the final and he , of course , was disappointed that he did not have a chance to win his gold through an actual fight . I feel more sorry for the Iranian boy . He must have trained hard to get to this stage and was not given a chance to fight . We are dealing with sports here , youth sports , in fact . It 's a pity that politics got involved . " However , IOC spokesman Mark Adams said : " As far as the IOC is concerned , there is no sinister intent here . What we know factually is that the athlete injured his ankle and was sent to the hospital for an X @-@ ray . Tests revealed he did not suffer anything broken , and he is all right now . So unless more factual information is available , it [ the controversy ] is mere speculation . " This was reiterated by IOC President Jacques Rogge on 17 August : " He [ Soleimani ] was driven to the hospital , was examined by a Singaporean doctor , totally independent , not belonging to the organisation and he diagnosed an ankle sprain . For us , that 's the end of the story . " Previously , Iran has stated that since its existing government does not recognize Israel as a state , its policy is to withdraw from competing against the country .

Bolivian Deputy Sports Minister Miguel Angel Rimba ordered an investigation into the claim . 
 Montenegro coach Sava Kovačević , whose team was knocked out by Bolivia in the semifinals , said that Montenegro would ask football governing body FIFA to look into the matter . However , FIFA announced they would not be doing so as complaints concerning the eligibility of players should have been submitted in writing to FIFA 's headquarters in Singapore at the Youth Olympic Games no later than five days before the first match , that is , by 8 August . FIFA also said that its staff had met all footballers individually at the Olympic Village and had checked their passports against their dates of birth provided by their respective National Olympic Committees .

 = Key Sounds Label = 
 Key Sounds Label is a Japanese independent record label formed in 2001 as a brand of the publishing company VisualArt 's . Key Sounds Label was formed to catalog and release music related to visual novels produced by the brand Key , also under VisualArt 's , known for developing such titles as Kanon and Air . Excluding two albums and one single that were released by Key and VisualArt 's before the label 's formation , the majority of releases on the label all have a basis from one of Key 's titles . There are other albums and singles on the label not directly related to the visual novels , such as two singles by Lia and one album by Riya . Unlike typical record labels , Key Sounds Label does not license any of the artists featured on albums and singles released on the label . 
 When Key Sounds Label formed , Jun Maeda , Shinji Orito , and Magome Togoshi were Key 's signature composers and have continued to produce the majority of the music on the label , though Togoshi is no longer affiliated with Key or VisualArt 's . Key often sells albums and singles on this label at the convention Comiket . Key Sounds Label is not under contract with JASRAC , or any other Japanese copyright collecting agency . As such , the releases on the label are not sold in Japanese stores with other music albums and singles , but are still widely available for online purchase . 
 = = History = = 
 Key Sounds Label has its origins in 1999 , two years before the first album on the label was released . When the visual novel company Key , under the publisher VisualArt 's , was about to release their debut title Kanon , Key produced the arrange album Anemoscope and bundled it with the first @-@ print release of Kanon released in June 1999 . The second music release , a single , occurred in November 1999 . The third release , another arrange album , followed in September 2000 bundled with the first @-@ print release of Key 's second title Air , and was the first music release by Key to bear a catalog number , <unk> @-@ 0303 . Each of these three were released in limited editions , and thus were not widely sold . 
 In 2001 , VisualArt 's and Key decided to form Key Sounds Label and start cataloging the albums and singles released by Key with the tag " KSLA – " followed by the four @-@ digit label number . For example , the first release bears the catalog number KSLA @-@ 0001 . The first two releases on the label were an album and a single released at the convention Comiket 60 in August 2001 , and were sold by Key . Since then , Key has regularly sold singles and albums under Key Sounds Label at subsequent Comiket conventions . Following the convention established with Kanon and Air , Key has released three more arrange albums bundled with the first @-@ print releases of Key 's later titles Clannad , Little Busters ! , and Little Busters ! Ecstasy . These three albums were never re @-@ released for general sale . In early 2008 , three of the albums on the label became available through the iTunes Store — partial albums of -Memento- and Recollections , and the complete album Ma @-@ Na — under the name Key Sound Team . Later , -Memento- was removed , and the full Recollections album became available . 
 Most of the releases on the label contain music directly related to Key 's visual novels , whether they be original soundtracks , remix albums , or image song singles and albums . There are other music singles and albums produced by members of Key not related to Key 's titles . For example , the first album released on the label , Humanity ... , is the only album released by Work @-@ S , a band produced by Shinji Orito . Two maxi singles containing songs sung by Lia were released on the label in December 2002 and August 2003 . An album entitled Love Song was released in August 2005 containing songs sung by Riya of Eufonius . In December 2006 , Key Sounds Label produced the first drama CD on the label , and two more followed in July 2007 . In December 2006 , the first anime music single to commemorate the second anime TV series adaptation of Kanon was produced on the label , and an anime single for the Clannad anime TV series followed in October 2007 . A third anime music single , this time for the Clannad After Story anime TV series , was released in November 2008 . A short remix album for Clannad After Story was released in December 2008 . Music singles and albums for the anime Angel Beats ! were released between April and December 2010 . A single for the Little Busters ! anime TV series was released in October 2012 . Two singles for the Little Busters ! Refrain anime TV series were released : the first in October 2013 and the second in November 2013 . 
 The first EP on Key Sounds Label contained songs from Air and was only released during the first concert of the Japanese trance music group OTSU held in May 2006 . The second EP contained songs from Little Busters ! and was only released during the second OTSU concert held in May 2008 . Both concerts were sponsored by Key Sounds Label , and both EPs were released on gramophone records . The first OTSU Club Music Compilation album primarily containing remixed music from Key 's visual novels was released in June 2006 . The second OTSU Club Music Compilation album was released in February 2008 as a promotion for the second concert , and contains remixed music from Little Busters ! .

 = Poison dart frog = 
 Poison dart frog ( also known as dart @-@ poison frog , poison frog or formerly known as poison arrow frog ) is the common name of a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America . These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies . This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the brightly colored species , making these species aposematic . Some species of the Dendrobatidae family exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity , while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity . The species that have great toxicity , derive this from their diet of ants , mites and termites . Other species however , that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity , eat a much larger variety of prey . Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit . 
 These amphibians are often called " dart frogs " due to the Amerindians ' indigenous use of their toxic secretions to poison the tips of <unk> . However , of over 170 species , only four have been documented as being used for this purpose ( curare plants are more commonly used ) , all of which come from the genus Phyllobates , which is characterized by the relatively large size and high levels of toxicity of its members . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Most species of poison dart frogs are small , sometimes less than 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) in adult length , although a few grow up to 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) in length . They weigh 1 oz. on average . Most poison dart frogs are brightly colored , displaying aposematic patterns to warn potential predators . Their bright coloration is associated with their toxicity and levels of alkaloids . For example , frogs of the genus Dendrobates have high levels of alkaloids , whereas Colostethus species are cryptically colored and are not toxic . 
 Poison dart frogs are an example of an aposematic organism . Their bright coloration advertises unpalatability to potential predators . Aposematism is currently thought to have originated at least four times within the poison dart family according to phylogenetic trees , and <unk> frogs have since undergone dramatic divergences – both interspecific and intraspecific – in their aposematic coloration . This is surprising given the frequency @-@ dependent nature of this type of defense mechanism . 
 Adult frogs lay their eggs in moist places , including on leaves , in plants , among exposed roots , and elsewhere . Once the eggs hatch , the adult <unk> the tadpoles , one at a time , to suitable water , either a pool , or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants . The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose , fed by unfertilized eggs laid at regular intervals by the mother . 
 = = Habitat = = 
 Poison dart frogs are endemic to humid , tropical environments of Central and South America . These frogs are generally found in tropical rainforests , including in Bolivia , Costa Rica , Brazil , Colombia , Ecuador , Venezuela , Suriname , French Guiana , Peru , Panama , Guyana , Nicaragua , and Hawaii ( introduced ) . 
 Natural habitats include subtropical and tropical , moist , lowland forests , subtropical or tropical high @-@ altitude shrubland , subtropical or tropical , moist , <unk> and rivers , freshwater marshes , intermittent freshwater marshes , lakes and swamps . Other species can be found in seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland , arable land , pastureland , rural gardens , plantations , moist savanna and heavily degraded former forest . Premontane forests and rocky areas have also been known to hold frogs . <unk> tend to live on or close to the ground , but also in trees as much as 10 m ( 33 ft ) from the ground . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Many species of poison dart frogs are dedicated parents . Many poison dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and <unk> carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy ; the tadpoles stick to the mucus on the backs of their parents . Once in the upper reaches of the rainforest trees , the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants , such as bromeliads . The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery , and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water . Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor , hidden beneath the leaf litter . Poison frogs fertilize their eggs externally ; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward , in the same manner as most fish . Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other , similar to the manner most frogs copulate . However , these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches . Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory . A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call ; females fight over desirable nests , and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor 's eggs . 
 The operational sex ratio in the poison dart frog family is mostly female biased . This leads to a few characteristic behaviors and traits found in organisms with an uneven sex ratio . In general , females have a choice of mate . In turn , males show brighter coloration , are territorial , and are aggressive toward other males . Females select mates based on coloration ( mainly dorsal ) , calling perch location , and territory . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Dart frogs are the focus of major phylogenetic studies , and undergo taxonomic changes frequently . The family Dendrobatidae was revised taxonomically in 2006 and contains 13 genera , with about 170 species . 
 = = = Color morphs = = = 
 Some poison dart frogs species include a number of conspecific color morphs that emerged as recently as 6 @,@ 000 years ago . Therefore , species such as Dendrobates tinctorius , Oophaga pumilio , and Oophaga granulifera can include color pattern morphs that can be interbred ( colors are under polygenic control , while the actual patterns are probably controlled by a single locus ) . Differing coloration has historically misidentified single species as separate , and there is still controversy among taxonomists over classification . 
 Variation in predation regimens may have influenced the evolution of polymorphism in Oophaga granulifera , while sexual selection appears to have contributed to differentiation among the Bocas del Toro populations of Oophaga pumilio . 
 = = Toxicity and medicine = = 
 Many poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins such as <unk> <unk> , <unk> , epibatidine , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> through their skin . Alkaloids in the skin glands of poison frogs serve as a chemical defense against predation , and they are therefore able to be active alongside potential predators during the day . About 28 structural classes of alkaloids are known in poison frogs . The most toxic of poison dart frog species is Phyllobates terribilis . It is argued that dart frogs do not synthesize their poisons , but sequester the chemicals from arthropod prey items , such as ants , centipedes and mites – the diet @-@ toxicity hypothesis . Because of this , captive @-@ bred animals do not possess significant levels of toxins as they are reared on diets that do not contain the alkaloids sequestered by wild populations . In fact , new studies suggest that the maternal frogs of some species lay unfertilized eggs , which are laced with trace amounts of alkaloids , to feed the tadpoles . This behavior shows that the poisons are introduced from a very young age . Nonetheless , the captive @-@ bred frogs retain the ability to accumulate alkaloids when they are once again provided an alkaloid @-@ containing diet . Despite the toxins used by some poison dart frogs , some predators have developed the ability to withstand them . One is the snake <unk> <unk> , which has developed immunity to the poison . 
 Chemicals extracted from the skin of <unk> tricolor may be shown to have medicinal value . Scientists use this poison to make a painkiller . One such chemical is a painkiller 200 times as potent as morphine , called epibatidine ; however , the therapeutic dose is very close to the fatal dose . A derivative ABT @-@ 594 developed by Abbott Laboratories , called <unk> got as far as Phase II trials in humans , but was dropped from further development due to unacceptable incidence of gastrointestinal side effects . Secretions from dendrobatids are also showing promise as muscle relaxants , heart stimulants and appetite <unk> . The most poisonous of these frogs , the golden poison frog ( Phyllobates terribilis ) , has enough toxin on average to kill ten to twenty men or about ten thousand mice . Most other dendrobatids , while colorful and toxic enough to discourage predation , pose far less risk to humans or other large animals . 
 = = Evolution of skin coloration and toxicity = = 
 An early study by Summers and Clough ( 2000 ) on the evolution of skin coloration and toxicity in the family Dendrobatidae indicated that evolution of skin toxicity correlated significantly with the evolution of bright coloration . Adding to this research , a study by Santos and Cannatella ( 2011 ) went on to explain that conspicuous coloration correlated with diet specialization , body mass , aerobic capacity , and chemical defense in poison frogs . Santos and Cannatella ( 2011 ) offer two evolutionary scenarios that explain these correlations . One possibility is that aposematism and aerobic capacity preceded greater resource gathering , making it easier for frogs to go out and gather the ants and mites required for diet specialization . This is counter to classical aposematic theory , which assumes toxicity from diet arises before signaling . Their second hypothesis suggests that diet specialization preceded higher aerobic capacity and that aposematism evolved in order to allow dendrobatids to gather resources without predation . 
 Other evidence suggests conspicuousness and toxicity may be inversely related . A recently published study by Wang and Shaffer ( 2011 ) supports this idea . This study found that polymorphic poison dart frogs that are less conspicuous are more toxic in comparison to the brightest and most conspicuous species . Energetic costs of producing toxins and bright color pigments lead to potential trade @-@ offs between toxicity and bright coloration . Prey with strong secondary defenses ( like the toxic frogs in the Wang and Shaffer 2011 study ) have less to gain from costly signaling . Therefore , prey populations that are more toxic are predicted to manifest less bright signals . This theory challenges the tenet that increased conspicuousness always evolves with increased toxicity . 
 Prey mobility could also explain the initial development of aposematic signaling . If prey have characteristics that make them more exposed to predators , such as size or habitat , then they have ample reason to develop aposematism . An example of this is the shift from nocturnal behavior to diurnal behavior in some dendrobatids . After the switch to diurnal behavior , the frogs had greater ecological opportunities and as a result dietary specialization arose . Thus , aposematism is not merely a signaling system , but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success . 
 Marples et al . , however , showed that dietary conservationism ( long @-@ term neophobia ) in predators could facilitate the evolution of warning coloration if predators avoid novel morphs for a long enough period of time . Another rarely acknowledged avenue of the evolution of aposematism is the gradual @-@ change hypothesis . Lindström et al. found that the gradual @-@ change hypothesis did not provide an easy solution to the beginnings of aposematism , but that “ cost @-@ free stepwise mutations over the range of weak signals could accumulate under neutral selection to produce effective strong signals ” . 
 Many studies have suggested that sexual selection plays a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in poison frogs . With female preferences in play , the coloration of males would change more rapidly . Sexual selection is influenced by many things . The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice . In the species Oophaga pumilio parental investment is not equal . The female makes the eggs and provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males makes the sperm ( less energy ) and only provides care for a few days . This differential in parental investment indicates that there will be a strong female preference . Sexual selection makes the phenotypic variation in a species increase drastically . <unk> and Iwasa ( 2010 ) found that there were populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection and populations that did not . In the populations that did use sexual selection , the phenotypic polymorphism was evident . 
 The lack of sexual dimorphism in some <unk> populations suggests that sexual selection is not a valid hypothesis of the changing coloration . This could be because the main protective measure in aposematic frog populations is their ability to warn predators of their toxicity . Rudh et al . ( 2011 ) predicted that female preference for brighter males would increase the coloration in both sexes and thus increase the fitness of both of the sexes . If there were a sexual dimorphism between males and females within an aposematic population there would be a difference in the predation of males and females that would cause an imbalance in the number of males and females , which would affect mating strategies and ultimately change the mating behavior of the species . 
 = = Captive care = = 
 All species of poison dart frogs are neotropical in origin . Wild @-@ caught specimens can maintain toxicity for some time ( this can be obtained through a form of bio accumulation ) , so appropriate care should be taken when handling such animals . While scientific study on the lifespan of poison dart frogs is scant , <unk> frequencies indicate it can range from one to three years in the wild . However , these frogs typically live for much longer than that in captivity , having been reported to live as long as 25 years . These claims also seem to be questionable , since many of the larger species take a year or more to mature , and Phyllobates species can take more than two years . In captivity , most species thrive where the humidity is kept constant at 80 to 100 % and where the temperature is around 72 ° F ( 22 ° C ) to 80 ° F ( 27 ° C ) during the day and no lower than 60 ° F ( 16 ° C ) to 65 ° F ( 18 ° C ) at night . Some species tolerate lower temperatures better than others . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 Many species of poison dart frogs have recently experienced habitat loss , chytrid diseases , and collection for the pet trade . Some are listed as threatened or endangered as a result . Zoos have tried to counteract this disease by treating captive frogs with an antifungal agent that is used to cure athlete 's foot in humans .

 Look Mickey ( also known as Look Mickey ! ) is a 1961 oil on canvas painting by Roy Lichtenstein . Widely regarded as the bridge between his abstract expressionism and pop art works , it is notable for its ironic humor and aesthetic value as well as being the first example of the artist 's employment of Ben @-@ Day dots , speech balloons and comic imagery as a source for a painting . The painting was bequeathed to the Washington , D.C. , National Gallery of Art upon Lichtenstein 's death . 
 Building on his late 1950s drawings of comic strips characters , Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein 's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations of pop culture and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery . In this , Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing to the work of artists today . Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book , showing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck during a fishing mishap . However , he makes significant alterations to the original source , including modifying the color scheme and perspective , while seeming to make statements about himself . 
 The work dates from Lichtenstein 's first solo exhibition , and is regarded by art critics as revolutionary both as a progression of pop art and as a work of modern art in general . It was later reproduced in his 1973 painting , Artist 's Studio — Look Mickey , which shows the painting hanging prominently on a facing wall of Lichtenstein 's studio . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips into their work . Lichtenstein was among them , and in 1958 began to make drawings of comic strip characters . Andy Warhol produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960 . Lichtenstein , unaware of Warhol 's work , produced Look Mickey and Popeye in 1961 . Lichtenstein 's 1961 works , especially Look Mickey , are considered a minor step from his earlier comic strip pop art . 
 According to the Lichtenstein Foundation , Look Mickey was based on the Little Golden Book series . The National Gallery of Art notes that the source is entitled Donald Duck Lost and Found , written in 1960 by Carl Buettner and published through Disney Enterprises . The image was illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten . An alternative theory suggests that Look Mickey and Popeye were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers . This image marked the first of numerous works in which Lichtenstein cropped his source to bring the viewer closer to the scene . 
 A number of stories purport to tell of the moment of inspiration for Look Mickey . Critic Alice Goldfarb Marquis writes that the artist recalled one of his sons pointing to a comic book and challenging ; " I bet you can 't paint as good as that " . Another says that the painting resulted from an effort to prove his abilities to both his son and his son 's classmates who mocked Lichtenstein 's hard @-@ to @-@ fathom abstracts . American painter Allan Kaprow once stated , in reference to a Bazooka <unk> Bubble Gum wrapper , to Lichtenstein , " You can 't teach color from Cézanne , you can only teach it from something like this . " Lichtenstein then showed him one of his Donald Duck images . 
 During the comic book phase of his career , Lichtenstein often slightly altered the colorization of the original source . According to Marco Livingstone , his early comic subjects comprise a " loose and improvised style clearly derived from de Kooning . " Art historian Jonathan Fineberg describes a Lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an " ... abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it , related stylistically to the de Kooning Women " . When Leo Castelli saw both Lichtenstein 's and Warhol 's large comic strip @-@ based works , he elected to show only Lichtenstein 's , causing Warhol to create the Campbell 's Soup Cans series to avoid competing with the more refined style of comics Lichtenstein was then producing . He once said " I 've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist , that will be very personal , that won 't look like I 'm doing exactly what they 're doing . " Lichtenstein 's foray into comics led to the abandonment of the topic by Warhol . Although Lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources , after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like Popeye and Mickey Mouse . 
 During autumn 1961 , Allan Kaprow , a fellow teacher at Rutgers University , introduced Lichenstein to art dealer Ivan Karp , the director of the Leo Castelli Gallery . Lichtenstein showed Karp several paintings , but not Look Mickey . He instead impressed him with Girl with Ball , and Karp decided to represent Lichtenstein a few weeks later . 
 = = Description = = 
 The painting is one of Lichtenstein 's first non @-@ expressionist works , and marks his initial employment of Ben @-@ Day dots which he used to give it an " industrial " half @-@ tone effect . The painting is his first use both of a speech balloon and comics as source material . The work has visible pencil marks and was produced using a plastic @-@ bristle dog brush to apply the oil paint onto the canvas . By the time of his death , Look Mickey was regarded as Lichtenstein 's breakthrough work . 
 In reproducing a mass @-@ produced illustration in a painterly style , Lichtenstein simplifies by reducing the composition to primary colors , which serves to accentuates its mass appeal and largely gives it the " pop " look . Typically , Ben @-@ Day dots enable an artist to produce a variety of colors by using dots of a few colors to give the illusion of a broader pallet . By mixing dots of different colors , like an ink jet printer , just a few colors can create a broad spectrum using only a limited number of primary hues . Lichtenstein as a painter and not a mass production printer is able to avoid this , achieving his individual color tones without blending existing hues . Instead , for each color that he wanted to include in a work , he used that color paint . 
 Lichtenstein made several alterations to the original work : he eliminated various non @-@ essential figures and rotated the dock so that Donald looks off the side rather than the end . At the same time , he kept Donald and Mickey in almost the same positions as they were in the original . Lichtenstein not only redesigned the space , but also altered the position of Donald 's body and fishing rod for better balance and eliminated signs of stress and exertion to form a meticulous composition . Walt Disney said about Donald Duck : " He 's got a big mouth , a big belligerent eye , a <unk> neck and a substantial backside that 's highly flexible . The duck comes near being the animator 's ideal subject . " Lichtenstein 's painting reflects many of these physical features . 
 Compared to the original source , Donald leans further forward towards the water , and Mickey less so . Mickey 's face is more flushed , seemingly less from exertion , than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards Donald . The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing , including <unk> the joining of the contours of the waves with the yellow sky to give rise to an area of white space . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 The large scale reproduction of a comic strip frame was considered radical and revolutionary at the time . Critics applauded the work 's playfulness , inherent humor and irreverence . According to Diane Waldman of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum , " Look Mickey is broad comedy and falls into the category of slapstick ... " In Lichtenstein 's obituary , Los Angeles Times critic Christopher Knight described the work as " a slyly hilarious riff on Abstract Expressionism " . Lichtenstein 's slight alterations to its " linear clarity and colour " , the critic writes , add to its aesthetic value and grandeur , reinforced by his choice of scale . A common misconception about Lichtenstein comes from the fact that in his best known works , his meticulous approach to painting is purposely disguised because he superficially seeks his paintings to appear as if facsimiles of industrial produced pop culture icons . Graham Bader wrote that " Lichtenstein 's painting in fact appears more the product of industrial manufacture than the very pulp image on which it is based . " Look Mickey is considered self @-@ referential in the sense that the artist is painting something through which the viewer may see elements of the artist . 
 Bader observes that Look Mickey is concerned both with the artistic process and Lichtenstein 's new painting techniques . He believes it can be considered a self @-@ portrait in the sense that it " explicitly situates the painting 's maker himself within the self @-@ enclosed narcissistic circuit at its center " . The painting shows Donald looking into the reflective water at Lichtenstein 's blue ' <unk> ' signature " as a kind of surrogate for the image 's creator " , in a manner that is reminiscent of Caravaggio 's Narcissus , in which the subject gazes at his own reflection on the water . This is viewed as an allegory of Lichtenstein 's position as an artist trained to develop his realist instincts despite the prominence of abstract expressionism . When viewed this way , Mickey serves as the " vanguard modernist " superego towering over Lichtenstein and laughing at his retrograde efforts . 
 Lichtenstein uses red Ben @-@ Day dots to color Mickey 's face . According to some art critics , this gives the character the appearance of blushing . Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or that it is the hue associated with a " healthy glow , " since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur . Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey 's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority . Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven <unk> of the red dots , but others are quick to point out that Lichtenstein 's Ben @-@ Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage . He did not develop the use of a stencil ( i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots ) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963 . 
 Graham Bader , describing it as the engine of the painting 's narrative , notes the intrigue created by the juxtaposition of Donald 's heightened sense of visual perception as it relates to his anticipated catch , and his deadened sense of tactile perception as it relates to having a fishing hook in the back of his own shirt . In this sense , Lichtenstein has chosen to depict a source that has as its subject a divide between raised visual awareness and an absent sense of touch : 
 Donald is an explicitly divided subject , all sensory experience on one end and , literally , numbness on the other ( and , visually , all depth and all flatness – for Donald 's face is by far the painting 's most spatially illusionistic element , while his caught jacket , merged with the schematic waves behind it , emphatically one of its flattest ) . Indeed , Donald is a portrait of precisely the separation of sight and feeling , vision and touch … What divides vision and touch in Look Mickey , what marks this shift between them , is text : the words that Donald ( and Lichtenstein ) introduces to the scene , and which the duck 's pole @-@ cum @-@ brush passes through before snagging his own back end . 
 Lichtenstein frequently explored vision @-@ related themes after he began to work in the pop art genre ; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room ... and There 's Nobody in It ! and Look Mickey . In this painting , Donald 's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey 's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant . Like Lichenstein 's works with subjects looking through a periscope ( Torpedo ... Los ! ) , a mirror ( Girl in Mirror ) or a peephole ( I Can See the Whole Room ... and There 's Nobody in It ! ) , Look Mickey , with a subject looking at his reflection in the water , is a prominent example of the theme of vision . He uses narrative to emphasize this motif , while presenting several visual elements . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The painting was included in Lichtenstein 's first solo exhibition at The Leo Castelli Gallery , a show in which all the works had pre @-@ sold before its opening in February 1962 . The exhibition , which ran from February 10 through March 3 , 1962 , included Engagement Ring , Blam and The Refrigerator . He included the painting in his Artist 's Studio — Look Mickey ( 1973 ) , showing it hanging prominently on the wall of the pictorial space intended to depict his studio as the ideal studio , and implying that his popularity with critic and public ratifies his choice of popular culture subject matter . Reflecting on Look Mickey many years later , he said : 
 The idea of doing [ a cartoon painting ] without apparent alteration just occurred to me ... and I did one really almost half seriously to get an idea of what it might look like . And as I was painting this painting I kind of got interested in organizing it as a painting and brought it to some kind of conclusion as an aesthetic statement , which I hadn 't really intended to do to begin with . And then I really went back to my other kind of painting , which was pretty abstract . Or tried to . But I had this cartoon painting in my studio , and it was a little too formidable . I couldn 't keep my eyes off it , and it sort of prevented me from painting in any other way , and then I decided this stuff was really serious ... I would say I had it on my easel for a week . I would just want to see what it looked like . I tried to make it a work of art . I wasn 't trying just to copy . I realized that this was just so much more compelling . 
 The painting was bequeathed to the Washington National Gallery of Art after Lichtenstein 's death in 1997 , following a 1990 pledge in honor of the institution 's 50th Anniversary . It remains in the gallery 's collection , where , as of November 2012 , it is on permanent view . 
 Harold Rosenberg once described <unk> reworking of the comics source as follows : " ... the difference between a comic strip of Mickey Mouse and a Lichtenstein painting of the same was art history , or the fact that Lichtenstein paints with the idea of the museum in mind . " 
 = 1930 FIFA World Cup = 
 The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural FIFA World Cup , the world championship for men 's national association football teams . It took place in Uruguay from 13 July to 30 July 1930 . FIFA , football 's international governing body , selected Uruguay as host nation , as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution , and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics . All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital , Montevideo , the majority at the Estadio Centenario , which was built for the tournament . 
 Thirteen teams ( seven from South America , four from Europe , and two from North America ) entered the tournament . Few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America . The teams were divided into four groups , with the winner of each group progressing to the semi @-@ finals . The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously , and were won by France and the United States , who defeated Mexico 4 – 1 and Belgium 3 – 0 , respectively . Lucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history , while American goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first official " clean sheet " in the tournament . 
 Argentina , Uruguay , the United States and Yugoslavia each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi @-@ finals .

 Italy , Sweden , the Netherlands , Spain , Hungary and Uruguay all lodged applications to host the event . Uruguay 's bid became the clear selection after all the other countries withdrew their bids . 
 = = Participants = = 
 The first World Cup was the only one without qualification . Every country affiliated with FIFA was invited to compete , and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept . Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas ; Argentina , Brazil , Bolivia , Chile , Mexico , Paraguay , Peru and the United States all entered . A total of seven South American teams participated , more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals . However , because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean , and the length of absence required for players , very few European teams were inclined to take part . Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances , and no European entries were received before the February deadline . In an attempt to gain some European participation , the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to The Football Association , even though the British Home Nations were not members of FIFA at the time . This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929 . Two months before the start of the tournament , no team from Europe had officially entered . 
 FIFA president Jules Rimet intervened , and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea : Belgium , France , Romania , and Yugoslavia . The Romanians , managed by Constantin Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf <unk> and Octav <unk> , entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King Carol II . He selected the squad personally , and negotiated with employers to ensure that the players would still have jobs upon their return . The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet , but neither France 's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team 's regular coach Gaston <unk> could be persuaded to make the trip . The Belgians participated at the instigation of German @-@ Belgian FIFA vice @-@ president Rodolphe <unk> . 
 The Romanians boarded the SS Conte Verde at Genoa , the French were picked up at Villefranche @-@ sur @-@ Mer on 21 June 1930 ; and the Belgians embarked at Barcelona . The Conte Verde carried Rimet , the trophy and the three designated European referees : the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe , along with Thomas <unk> , a Parisian who may have been English . The Brazilian team were picked up when the boat docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July . Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship Florida from Marseille . 
 In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia there were doubts about their participation at first . Since the Croatians decided to boycott the national team , King Alexander I did not want to finance the whole idea , but in the end they found a solution . Belgrade football association officials decided to round up only domestic ( Serbian ) star players , mainly from two rival Belgrade clubs , <unk> and SK Jugoslavija , with an additional three Serbs who played for French clubs ( Ivan Bek among them ) . Therefore , the Yugoslavia team was exclusively made up of Serbian players ; and with the two biggest stars of the team , Blagoje <unk> ( " Moša " ) and Aleksandar <unk> ( " <unk> " ) , both from <unk> , they were ready for a trip to South America to represent Yugoslavia in the World Cup . The <unk> were the youngest team in the World Cup ; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days . After their first match , against Brazil , they received a new nickname " The Ich @-@ es " or " <unk> " ( in Spanish ) by the Uruguayan press ; referring to most of the player 's surnames that ended up with the " <unk> " or " <unk> " suffix , which is quite common for Serbian last names . They achieved the biggest success in both Yugoslav and Serbian subsequent World Cup footballing history , by earning third place ( according to their sources ) .

 All matches took place in Montevideo . Three stadiums were used : Estadio Centenario , Estadio Pocitos , and Estadio Parque Central . The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence . Designed by Juan <unk> , it was the primary stadium for the tournament , referred to by Rimet as a " temple of football " . With a capacity of 90 @,@ 000 , it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles . The stadium hosted 10 of the 18 matches , including both semi @-@ finals and the final . However , a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament . Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs Nacional and Peñarol , the 20 @,@ 000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos .

 Fifteen referees participated in the tournament : four Europeans – two Belgians ( Henri Christophe and John Langenus ) , a Frenchman , and a Romanian ( Constantin Rădulescu being the Romanian coach ) , and eleven from the Americas – among them six Uruguayans . In order to eliminate differences in the application of the Laws of the Game , the referees were invited to one short meeting in which to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game . 
 Of all the refereeing appointments , the two that attracted most attention was that of Gilberto de Almeida Rêgo in the match between Argentina and France , in which the Brazilian referee blew for full @-@ time six minutes early , and that of the Bolivian Ulises Saucedo 's in the Argentina and Mexico encounter , which Argentina won 6 – 3 .

 The first group was the only one to contain four teams : Argentina , Chile , France and Mexico . Two days after France 's victory over Mexico , they faced group favourites Argentina . Injuries hindered France ; goalkeeper Alex <unk> had to leave the field after 20 minutes , and Laurent , after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti , spent most of the match limping . However , they held out for most of the match , only succumbing to an 81st @-@ minute goal scored from a Monti free kick . The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rêgo erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early , with Frenchman Marcel <unk> clear on goal ; play only resumed after protests from the French players . Though France had played twice in 48 hours , Chile had yet to play their first match . They faced Mexico the following day , gaining a comfortable 3 – 0 win . 
 France 's final match , against Chile , featured the first penalty kick of the tournament and World Cup history . The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex <unk> of France on 19 July 1930 , saving from Chile 's Carlos Vidal in the 30th minute of the match . In Argentina 's second match , against Mexico , three penalty kicks were awarded . During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico 's Oscar <unk> Martínez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina 's Fernando Paternoster . Guillermo Stábile scored a hat @-@ trick in his international debut as Argentina won 6 – 3 , despite the absence of their captain Manuel Ferreira , who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam . Qualification was decided by the group 's final match , contested by Argentina and Chile , who had beaten France and Mexico , respectively . The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti . Argentina won 3 – 1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi @-@ finals .

 The second group contained Brazil , Bolivia and Yugoslavia . Brazil , the group seeds , were expected to progress , but in the group 's opening match , unexpectedly lost 2 – 1 to Yugoslavia . Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match . For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter , spelling " Viva Uruguay " as the team lined up . Both of Bolivia 's matches followed a similar pattern , a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat . Against Yugoslavia , they held out for an hour before conceding , but were four goals down by the final whistle . Misfortune played its part ; several Bolivian goals were disallowed . Against Brazil , when both teams had only pride to play for , the score was 1 – 0 to Brazil at half @-@ time . Brazil added three more in the second half , two of them scored by the multi @-@ sportsman <unk> . Yugoslavia qualified for the semi @-@ finals . 
 = = = Group 3 = = = 
 Hosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania . The opening match in this group saw the first player expulsion in the competition , when Plácido Galindo of Peru was dismissed against Romania . The Romanians made their man advantage pay ; their 3 – 1 win included two late goals . This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history . The official attendance was 2 @,@ 459 , but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300 . 
 Because of construction delays at Estadio Centenario , Uruguay 's first match was not played until five days into the tournament . The first to be held at the Centenario , it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations . The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp , at which strict discipline was exercised . Goalkeeper Andrés <unk> was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife . One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay 's first constitution , the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1 – 0 . Spectators praised Peru 's defense , and this turned out to be the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal . The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press , but lauded in Peru . Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease , scoring four first half goals to win 4 – 0 .

 The United States dominated the fourth group . The American team , which contained a significant number of new caps , were reputedly nicknamed " the shot @-@ putters " by an unnamed source in the French contingent . They beat their first opponents , Belgium , 3 – 0 . The ease of the victory was unexpected ; Uruguayan newspaper Imparcial wrote that " the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts " . Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the pitch and refereeing decisions , claiming that the second goal was offside . The group 's second match , played in windy conditions , witnessed the first tournament hat @-@ trick , scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States against Paraguay . Until 10 November 2006 , the first hat @-@ trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stábile of Argentina , two days after Patenaude ; however , in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude 's claim to being the first hat @-@ trick scorer was valid , as a goal previously assigned to teammate Tom <unk> was <unk> to Patenaude . With the United States having secured qualification , the final match in the group was a dead rubber . Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1 – 0 margin . 
 = = = Semi @-@ finals = = = 
 The four group winners , Argentina , Yugoslavia , Uruguay and the United States , moved to the semi @-@ finals . The two semi @-@ final matches saw identical scores . The first semi @-@ final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain @-@ drenched pitch . The United States team , which featured six British @-@ born players , lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent . A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1 – 0 half @-@ time lead . In the second half , the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks , the match finishing 6 – 1 to Argentina . 
 In the second semi @-@ final there were shades of the 1924 Summer Olympics match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay . Here , though , Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through <unk> . Uruguay then took a 2 – 1 lead . Then shortly before half @-@ time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision . The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6 – 1 , Pedro <unk> completing a hat @-@ trick . 
 = = = Third and fourth place = = = 
 The now @-@ traditional third place play @-@ off was not established until 1934 , so the format of the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams . Occasional sources , notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984 , incorrectly imply that a third @-@ place match occurred and was won 3 – 1 by Yugoslavia . Accounts differ as to whether a third @-@ place match was originally scheduled . According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad , Yugoslavia refused to play a third @-@ place match because they were upset with the refereeing in their semi @-@ final against Uruguay . 
 At the end of the championship , the captains of the United States team ( Tom <unk> ) and Yugoslavia ( Milutin <unk> ) both received bronze medals . Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals ; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth , a practice since continued by FIFA . In 2010 , the son of Kosta <unk> , the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice @-@ president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time , claimed that Yugoslavia , as a team , has been awarded one bronze medal , which has been kept by <unk> himself and his family for the following 80 years . According to this source , Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi @-@ finals loss to the eventual champions , Uruguay . 
 = = = Final = = = 
 The resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi @-@ finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic final , which Uruguay had won 2 – 1 after a replay . 
 The final was played at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July . Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine supporters crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte ( " victory or death " ) , dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public . The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate , and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing . An estimated 10 – 15 @,@ 000 Argentinians made the trip , but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick @-@ off , let alone reach the stadium . At the stadium , supporters were searched for weapons . The gates were opened at eight o 'clock , six hours before kick @-@ off , and at noon the ground was full , the official attendance 93 @,@ 000 . A disagreement overshadowed the build @-@ up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball , forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second . Uruguay made one change from their semi @-@ final line @-@ up . Castro replaced Anselmo , who missed out due to illness . Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match . The referee was Belgian John Langenus , who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game , having sought assurances for his safety . One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle , in case he needed to make a quick escape . 
 The hosts scored the opening goal through Pablo Dorado , a low shot from a position on the right . Argentina , displaying superior passing ability , responded strongly . Within eight minutes they were back on level terms ; Carlos <unk> received a Ferreira through @-@ ball , beat his marker and equalised . Shortly before half @-@ time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stábile gave Argentina a 2 – 1 lead . Uruguay captain <unk> protested , maintaining that Stábile was offside , but to no avail . In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant . Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3 – 1 , Uruguay attacked in numbers , and Pedro <unk> scored an equaliser . Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead , and just before full @-@ time Castro made it 4 – 2 to seal the win . Langenus ended the match a minute later , and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions . Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy , which was later named for him , to the head of the Uruguayan Football Association , Raúl Jude . The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay ; in the Argentinian capital , Buenos Aires , a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate . Francisco <unk> ( who played as a forward for Argentina ) was the last player of the final to die , on 30 August 2010 . 
 France , Yugoslavia and the United States all played friendlies in South America following the competition . Brazil played France on 1 August , Yugoslavia on 10 August and the United States on 17 August , while Argentina hosted Yugoslavia on 3 August . 
 Uruguay 's aggregate goal difference of + 12 over four games , at an average of + 3 per match , remains the highest average goal difference per match of any World Cup champion , and the second highest of any World Cup Finals participant , after Hungary in 1954 .

 = Olympic Games = 
 The modern Olympic Games or Olympics ( French : Jeux olympiques ) are the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions . The Olympic Games are considered to be the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart . 
 Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority . 
 The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . As a result , the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games . World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916 , 1940 , and 1944 Games . Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games . 
 The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations ( IFs ) , National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) , and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games . As the decision @-@ making body , the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games , and organizes and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter . The IOC also determines the Olympic program , consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games . There are several Olympic rituals and symbols , such as the Olympic flag and torch , as well as the opening and closing ceremonies . Over 13 @,@ 000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events . The first , second , and third @-@ place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals : gold , silver , and bronze , respectively . 
 The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented . This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies , including boycotts , doping , bribery , and a terrorist attack in 1972 . Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame . The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world . 
 = = Ancient Olympics = = 
 The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia , Greece . Competition was among representatives of several city @-@ states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece . These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration , horse and chariot racing events . It has been widely written that during the Games , all conflicts among the participating city @-@ states were postponed until the Games were finished . This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce . This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars . The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus . The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend ; one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games . According to legend , it was Heracles who first called the Games " Olympic " and established the custom of holding them every four years . The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labors , he built the Olympic Stadium as an honor to Zeus . Following its completion , he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a " stadion " ( Greek : <unk> , Latin : stadium , " stage " ) , which later became a unit of distance . The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776 BC ; this is based on inscriptions , found at Olympia , listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776 BC . The Ancient Games featured running events , a pentathlon ( consisting of a jumping event , discus and javelin throws , a foot race , and wrestling ) , boxing , wrestling , pankration , and equestrian events . Tradition has it that <unk> , a cook from the city of Elis , was the first Olympic champion . 
 The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance , featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honoring both Zeus ( whose famous statue by Phidias stood in his temple at Olympia ) and Pelops , divine hero and mythical king of Olympia . Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of <unk> . The winners of the events were admired and immortalized in poems and statues . The Games were held every four years , and this period , known as an Olympiad , was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement . The Games were part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games , which included the Pythian Games , the Nemean Games , and the Isthmian Games . 
 The Olympic Games reached their zenith in the 6th and 5th centuries BC , but then gradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in Greece . While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended , the most commonly held date is 393 AD , when the emperor Theodosius I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated . Another date commonly cited is 426 AD , when his successor , Theodosius II , ordered the destruction of all Greek temples .

 = = = Forerunners = = = 
 Various uses of the term " Olympic " to describe athletic events in the modern era have been documented since the 17th century . The first such event was the Cotswold Games or " Cotswold Olimpick Games " , an annual meeting near Chipping Campden , England , involving various sports . It was first organized by the lawyer Robert Dover between 1612 and 1642 , with several later celebrations leading up to the present day . The British Olympic Association , in its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London , mentioned these games as " the first stirrings of Britain 's Olympic beginnings " . 
 L <unk> de la République , a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in Revolutionary France also attempted to emulate the ancient Olympic Games . The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics . The 1796 Games also marked the introduction of the metric system into sport . 
 In 1850 an Olympian Class was started by Dr. William Penny Brookes at Much Wenlock , in Shropshire , England . In 1859 , Dr. Brookes changed the name to the Wenlock Olympian Games . This annual sports festival continues to this day . The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded by Dr. Brookes on 15 November 1860 . 
 Between 1862 and 1867 , Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival . Devised by John Hulley and Charles Melly , these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook , although only ' gentlemen amateurs ' could compete . The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics . In 1865 Hulley , Dr. Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool , a forerunner of the British Olympic Association . Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter . In 1866 , a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organized at London 's Crystal Palace . 
 = = = Revival = = = 
 Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821 . It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis <unk> in his poem " Dialogue of the Dead " , published in 1833 . Evangelos Zappas , a wealthy Greek @-@ Romanian philanthropist , first wrote to King Otto of Greece , in 1856 , offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games . Zappas sponsored the first Olympic Games in 1859 , which was held in an Athens city square . Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire . Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient Panathenaic Stadium so that it could host all future Olympic Games . 
 The stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875 . Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870 , though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games . In 1890 , after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society , Baron Pierre de Coubertin was inspired to found the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) . Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years . He presented these ideas during the first Olympic Congress of the newly created International Olympic Committee . This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894 , at the University of Paris . On the last day of the Congress , it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896 . The IOC elected the Greek writer Demetrius Vikelas as its first president . 
 = = = 1896 Games = = = 
 The first Games held under the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic stadium in Athens in 1896 . The Games brought together 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events . Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games . This trust was used to help finance the 1896 Games . George Averoff contributed generously for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games . The Greek government also provided funding , which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set . 
 Greek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games . This feeling was shared by many of the athletes , who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city . The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world . The second Olympics was held in Paris . 
 = = = Changes and adaptations = = = 
 After the success of the 1896 Games , the Olympics entered a period of stagnation that threatened their survival . The Olympic Games held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the World 's fair at St. Louis in 1904 were side shows . The Games in Paris did not have a stadium , but were notable for being the first time women took part in the Games . When the St. Louis Games were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated , but 580 were from the United States . The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement . The Games rebounded when the 1906 Intercalated Games ( so @-@ called because they were the second Games held within the third Olympiad ) were held in Athens . These Games were , but are not now , officially recognized by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since . The Games attracted a broad international field of participants and generated great public interest . This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Olympics . 
 = = = = Winter Games = = = = 
 The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games . Figure skating ( in 1908 and 1920 ) and ice hockey ( in 1920 ) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics . The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities . At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne , it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games . A winter sports week ( it was actually 11 days ) was held in 1924 in Chamonix , France , in connection with the Paris Games held three months later ; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games . Although it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year , this idea was quickly abandoned . The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart . This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in Albertville , France ; after that , beginning with the 1994 Games , the Winter Olympics were held every four years , two years after each Summer Olympics . 
 = = = = Paralympics = = = = 
 In 1948 , Sir Ludwig Guttmann , determined to promote the <unk> of soldiers after World War II , organized a multi @-@ sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the 1948 London Olympics . Guttmann 's event , known then as the Stoke Mandeville Games , became an annual sports festival . Over the next twelve years , Guttmann and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing . For the 1960 Olympic Games , in Rome , Guttmann brought 400 athletes to compete in the " Parallel Olympics " , which became known as the first Paralympics . Since then , the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year . Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , South Korea , the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics . In 2001 the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) signed an agreement guaranteeing that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games . The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing , and the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver . Chairman of the London organising committee , Lord Coe , said about the 2012 Summer Paralympics and Olympics in London that , 
 We want to change public attitudes towards disability , celebrate the excellence of Paralympic sport and to enshrine from the very outset that the two Games are an integrated whole . 
 = = = = Youth Games = = = = 
 In 2010 , the Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games , which give athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to compete . The Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president Jacques Rogge in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC . The first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from 14 – 26 August 2010 , while the inaugural Winter Games were hosted in Innsbruck , Austria , two years later . These Games will be shorter than the senior Games ; the summer version will last twelve days , while the winter version will last nine days . The IOC allows 3 @,@ 500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games , and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games . The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games , however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events . 
 = = = 21st @-@ century games = = = 
 From 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896 , the Games have grown to about 10 @,@ 500 competitors from 204 nations at the 2012 Summer Olympics . The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller . For example , Sochi hosted 2 @,@ 873 athletes from 88 nations competing in 98 events during the 2014 Winter Olympics . During the Games most athletes and officials are housed in the Olympic Village . This village is intended to be a self @-@ contained home for all the Olympic participants , and is furnished with cafeterias , health clinics , and locations for religious expression . 
 The IOC allowed the formation of National Olympic Committees representing nations that did not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that other international organizations demand . As a result , colonies and dependencies are permitted to compete at Olympic Games . Examples of this include territories such as Puerto Rico , Bermuda , and Hong Kong , all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country . The current version of the Charter allows for the establishment of new National Olympic Committees to represent nation which qualify as " an independent State recognized by the international community " . Therefore , it did not allow the formation of National Olympic Committees for Sint Maarten and Curaçao when they gained the same constitutional status as Aruba in 2010 , although the IOC had recognized the Aruban Olympic Committee in 1986 . After 2012 , Netherlands Antilles athletes can choose to represent either the Netherlands or Aruba . 
 = = = Economic and social impact on host cities and countries = = = 
 Many economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games , emphasizing that such " mega @-@ events " often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run . Conversely hosting ( or even bidding for ) the Olympics appears to increase the host country 's exports , as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games . Moreover , research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city , which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector . This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards , although not permanently . This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society . 
 The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities ; for example , the Centre on Housing Rights and <unk> reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades , often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups . The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were the most expensive Olympic Games in history , costing in excess of US $ 50 billion . According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that was released at the time of the games , this cost will not boost Russia 's national economy , but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services . But by December 2014 , The Guardian stated that Sochi " now feels like a ghost town " , citing the spread @-@ out nature of the stadiums and arenas , the still @-@ unfinished construction , and the overall effects Russia 's political and economic turmoil . Furthermore , at least four cities withdrew their bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics , citing the costs to host the games . 
 = = International Olympic Committee = = 
 The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organizations and federations , recognized media partners , as well as athletes , officials , judges , and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter . As the umbrella organization of the Olympic Movement , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) is responsible for selecting the host city , overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games , updating and approving the sports program , and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights . 
 The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements : 
 International Federations ( IFs ) are the governing bodies that supervise a sport at an international level . For example , the International Federation of Association Football ( FIFA ) is the IF for association football , and the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball is the international governing body for volleyball . There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic Movement , representing each of the Olympic sports . 
 National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) represent and regulate the Olympic Movement within each country . For example , the United States Olympic Committee ( USOC ) is the NOC of the United States . There are currently 205 NOCs recognized by the IOC . 
 Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games ( <unk> ) are temporary committees responsible for the organization of each Olympic Games . <unk> are dissolved after each Games once the final report is delivered to the IOC . 
 French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement . The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country ( or languages , if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English ) . Every proclamation ( such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony ) is spoken in these three ( or more ) languages , or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 The IOC has often been criticized for being an intractable organization , with several members on the committee for life . The presidential terms of Avery Brundage and Juan Antonio Samaranch were especially controversial . Brundage was president for over 20 years , and during his tenure he protected the Olympics from political involvement and the influence of advertising . He was accused of both racism , for his handling of the apartheid issue with the South African delegation , and antisemitism . Under the Samaranch presidency , the office was accused of both nepotism and corruption . Samaranch 's ties with the Franco regime in Spain were also a source of criticism . 
 In 1998 , it was uncovered that several IOC members had taken bribes from members of the Salt Lake City bid committee for the hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics . The IOC pursued an investigation which led to the resignation of four members and expulsion of six others . The scandal set off further reforms that changed the way host cities were selected , to avoid similar cases in the future . 
 A BBC documentary entitled Panorama : Buying the Games , aired in August 2004 , investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics . The documentary claimed it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city . After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games , Parisian mayor Bertrand Delanoë specifically accused the British prime minister Tony Blair and the London Bid Committee ( headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe ) of breaking the bid rules . He cited French president Jacques Chirac as a witness ; Chirac gave guarded interviews regarding his involvement . The allegation was never fully explored . The Turin bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy . A prominent IOC member , Marc <unk> , strongly connected with the rival bid of Sion , Switzerland , alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organizing Committee . These accusations led to a wide @-@ ranging investigation . The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sion 's bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination . 
 In July 2012 , the Anti @-@ Defamation League called the continued refusal by the International Olympic Committee to hold a moment of silence at the opening ceremony for the eleven Israeli athletes killed by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Munich Olympics , " a continuing stubborn insensitivity and callousness to the memory of the murdered Israeli athletes .

 The Olympics have been commercialized to various degrees since the initial 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens , when a number of companies paid for <unk> , including Kodak . In 1908 , Oxo , <unk> mouthwash and Indian Foot Powder became official sponsors of the London Olympic Games . 
 Coca Cola sponsored of the 1928 Summer Olympics , and has subsequently remained a sponsor to the current time . 
 Before the IOC took control of sponsorship , national organizing committees were responsible for negotiating their own contracts for sponsorship and the use of the Olympic symbols . 
 = = = Under IOC control = = = 
 The IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors . It was not until the retirement of IOC president Avery Brundage , in 1972 , that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them . Under the leadership of Juan Antonio Samaranch the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand . 
 = = = Budget = = = 
 During the first half of the 20th century the IOC ran on a small budget . As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972 , Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest . Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC 's decision @-@ making . Brundage 's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organizing committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols . When Brundage retired the IOC had US $ 2 million in assets ; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US $ 45 million . This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights . When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent . 
 The 1984 Summer Olympics became a watershed moment in Olympic history . The Los Angeles @-@ based organizing committee , led by Peter Ueberroth , was able to generate a surplus of US $ 225 million , which was an unprecedented amount at that time . The organizing committee had been able to create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies . The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights . Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Program ( TOP ) in 1985 , in order to create an Olympic brand . Membership in TOP was , and is , very exclusive and expensive . Fees cost US $ 50 million for a four @-@ year membership . Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category , and use of the Olympic symbol , the interlocking rings , in their publications and advertisements . 
 = = = Effect of television = = = 
 The 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin were the first Games to be broadcast on television , though only to local audiences . The 1956 Winter Olympics were the first internationally televised Olympic Games , and the following Winter Games had their broadcasting rights sold for the first time to specialized television broadcasting networks — CBS paid US $ 394 @,@ 000 for the American rights , and the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) allocated US $ 660 @,@ 000 . In the following decades the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War . Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy , and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium . The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games , thereby generating more interest , which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television . This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever @-@ increasing fees for those rights . For example , CBS paid US $ 375 million for the rights of the 1998 Nagano Games , while NBC spent US $ 3 @.@ 5 billion for the broadcast rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012 . 
 Viewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the century . This was due to the use of satellites to broadcast live television worldwide in 1964 , and the introduction of color television in 1968 . Global audience estimates for the 1968 Mexico City Games was 600 million , whereas at the Los Angeles Games of 1984 , the audience numbers had increased to 900 million ; that number swelled to 3 @.@ 5 billion by the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona . However , at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney , NBC drew the lowest ratings for any Summer or Winter Olympics since 1968 . This was attributed to two factors : one was the increased competition from cable channels , the second was the internet , which was able to display results and video in real time . Television companies were still relying on tape @-@ delayed content , which was becoming outdated in the information era . A drop in ratings meant that television studios had to give away free advertising time . With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games , the added pressure of the internet , and increased competition from cable , the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings . The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic program . At the Summer Games , the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights , and a Champions Gala was added to draw greater interest . The IOC also expanded the swimming and diving programs , both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers . Finally , the American television lobby was able to dictate when certain events were held so that they could be broadcast live during prime time in the United States . The results of these efforts were mixed : ratings for the 2006 Winter Games were significantly lower than those for the 2002 Games , while there was a sharp increase in viewership for the 2008 Summer Olympics , and the 2012 Summer Games became the most watched event in US television history . 
 The sale of the Olympic brand has been controversial . The argument is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialized sporting spectacle . Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games . The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic @-@ related wares . The IOC indicated that they would address this to prevent spectacles of over @-@ marketing at future Games . Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments ; the IOC incurs none of the cost , yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols . The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income . Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games , even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments . Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics . 
 = = Symbols = = 
 The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter . The Olympic symbol , better known as the Olympic rings , consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents ( Africa , America , Asia , Oceania , Europe ) . The colored version of the rings — blue , yellow , black , green , and red — over a white field forms the Olympic flag . These colors were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag . The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp , Belgium . It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games . 
 The Olympic motto , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a Latin expression meaning " Faster , Higher , Stronger " was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin in 1894 and has been official since 1924 . The motto was coined by Coubertin 's friend the Dominican priest Henri Didon OP , for a Paris youth gathering of 1891 . 
 Coubertin 's Olympic ideals are expressed in the Olympic creed : 
 The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part , just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle . The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well . 
 Months before each Games , the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals . A female performer , acting as a priestess , ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun 's rays ; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer , thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city 's Olympic stadium , where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony . Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928 , the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games . 
 The Olympic mascot , an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country , was introduced in 1968 . It has played an important part on the Games identity promotion since the 1980 Summer Olympics , when the Russian bear cub Misha reached international stardom . The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire . Much Wenlock still hosts the Wenlock Olympian Games , which were an inspiration to Pierre de Coubertin for the Olympic Games . 
 = = Ceremonies = = 
 = = = Opening = = = 
 As mandated by the Olympic Charter , various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games . This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred . Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp . The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country 's flag and a performance of its national anthem . The host nation then presents artistic displays of music , singing , dance , and theater representative of its culture . The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor 's in terms of memorability . The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $ 100 million , with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment . 
 After the artistic portion of the ceremony , the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation . Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter in order to honor the origins of the Olympics . Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country 's chosen language , with the host country 's athletes being the last to enter . During the 2004 Summer Olympics , which was hosted in Athens , Greece , the Greek flag entered the stadium first , while the Greek delegation entered last . Speeches are given , formally opening the Games . Finally , the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier , often a successful Olympic athlete from the host nation , who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium 's cauldron . 
 = = = Closing = = = 
 The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded . Flag @-@ bearers from each participating country enter the stadium , followed by the athletes who enter together , without any national distinction . Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played : the flag of the current host country ; the flag of Greece , to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games ; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games . The president of the organizing committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches , the Games are officially closed , and the Olympic flame is extinguished . In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony , the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC , who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games . The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture . 
 As is customary , the men 's marathon medals ( at the Summer Olympics ) or the men 's 50 km cross @-@ country skiing freestyle mass start medals ( at the Winter Olympics ) are presented as part of the Closing Ceremony , which take place later that day , in the Olympic Stadium , and are thus the last medal presentation of the Games . 
 = = = Medal presentation = = = 
 A medal ceremony is held after each Olympic event is concluded . The winner , second and third @-@ place competitors or teams stand on top of a three @-@ tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals . After the medals are given out by an IOC member , the national flags of the three medalists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medalist 's country plays . Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies , as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag @-@ bearers . 
 As is customary , the men 's marathon medals are presented as part of the Summer Closing Ceremony , which take place later that day , in the Olympic Stadium - thus , they are the final medal presentation of the Games . 
 = = Sports = = 
 The Olympic Games program consists of 35 sports , 30 disciplines and 408 events . For example , wrestling is a Summer Olympic sport , comprising two disciplines : Greco @-@ Roman and Freestyle . It is further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women , each representing a different weight class . The Summer Olympics program includes 26 sports , while the Winter Olympics program features 15 sports . Athletics , swimming , fencing , and artistic gymnastics are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic program . Cross @-@ country skiing , figure skating , ice hockey , Nordic combined , ski jumping , and speed skating have been featured at every Winter Olympics program since its inception in 1924 . Current Olympic sports , like badminton , basketball , and volleyball , first appeared on the program as demonstration sports , and were later promoted to full Olympic sports . Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the program . 
 Olympic sports are governed by international sports federations ( IFs ) recognized by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports . There are 35 federations represented at the IOC . There are sports recognized by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program . These sports are not considered Olympic sports , but they can be promoted to this status during a program revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games . During such revisions , sports can be excluded or included in the program on the basis of a two @-@ thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC . There are recognized sports that have never been on an Olympic program in any capacity , including chess and surfing . 
 In October and November 2004 , the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission , which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic program and all non @-@ Olympic recognized sports . The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic program for each celebration of the Games . The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic program . These criteria are history and tradition of the sport , universality , popularity of the sport , image , athletes ' health , development of the International Federation that governs the sport , and costs of holding the sport . From this study five recognized sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics : golf , karate , rugby union , roller sports and squash . These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005 . Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists : karate and squash . Neither sport attained the required two @-@ thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic program . In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games . 
 The 114th IOC Session , in 2002 , limited the Summer Games program to a maximum of 28 sports , 301 events , and 10 @,@ 500 athletes . Three years later , at the 117th IOC Session , the first major program revision was performed , which resulted in the exclusion of baseball and softball from the official program of the 2012 London Games . Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports , the 2012 program featured just 26 sports . The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf . 
 = = = Amateurism and professionalism = = = 
 The ethos of the aristocracy as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin . The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education , an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore <unk> , a sound mind in a sound body . In this ethos , a gentleman was one who became an all @-@ rounder , not the best at one specific thing . There was also a prevailing concept of fairness , in which practicing or training was considered tantamount to cheating . Those who practiced a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby .
