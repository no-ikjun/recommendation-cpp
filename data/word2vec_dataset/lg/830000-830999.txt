 When Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle in 1814 , he learned of several traditional tales relating to the area and the clan . He was told that the Fairy Flag had three magical properties . The first was that it multiplied the number of men upon a battlefield . The second was that when it was spread upon a nuptial bed , it ensured fertility . The third was that it brought herring into the loch .

 In the early 20th century , R.C. MacLeod noted several traditions concerning the flag . One told how the flag came into the possession of the MacLeods through a fairy . A similar tradition relates of a fairy @-@ lullaby . 
 = = = = Fairy lover = = = = 
 The first of these traditions related by R.C. MacLeod tells how one of the chiefs of Clan MacLeod married a fairy ; however , after twenty years she is forced to leave him and return to fairyland . She bade farewell to the chief at the Fairy Bridge ( which stands about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from Dunvegan ) and gave him the flag . She promised that if it was waved in times of danger and distress , help would be given on three occasions . A similar tradition , related by John Arnott MacCulloch , stated that although the fairy 's gift had the power to save both her husband and his clan , afterwards an invisible being would come to take both the flag and its bearer away — never to be seen again . 
 = = = = Fairy lullaby = = = = 
 R.C. MacLeod considered the above ' fairy lover ' tradition to be connected to another about a lullaby . This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod , who was the clan bard in the last half of the 19th century ; he obtained the tradition from several old women in ' MacLeod country ' . This lullaby @-@ tradition related how on an autumn night , a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle . She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle . The nursemaid , who was within the room as well , was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby . This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid 's memory , and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song . R.C. MacLeod stated that , over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family , to whom this lullaby was sung , would be protected by the power of the fairies . For a while , no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song . A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle , and the custom of singing the fairy 's lullaby ceased to be followed — but according to R.C. MacLeod , not completely forgotten . R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847 , for his infant elder brother , who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod ( 1847 – 1935 ) , 27th chief of the clan . An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right .

 Another tradition , related by R.C. MacLeod , told of certain events which took place after an heir to the clan 's chiefship was born . The story related how at this time , there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle , and since the infant 's nursemaid was anxious to join in the festivities in the hall below , she left the infant alone in her room . When the baby awoke , crying of cold , no human help could hear him in his secluded room ; however , a host of fairies appeared and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag . Meanwhile , the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth . When she brought out the baby , wrapped in the flag , everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him . The room was filled with the fairies ' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times . When the song ended , and silence fell across the crowded room , the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved . 
 = = = = Eastern origins = = = = 
 R.C. MacLeod listed another tradition , somewhat similar to the one that appeared in c.1800 manuscript . According to this version , a MacLeod joined a Crusading army , and went to the Holy Land . While in the desert @-@ wilderness , he came across a witch , from whom he managed to escape . He then came upon a river , and proceeded to cross it at a ford . However , a fairy maiden appeared from the water and blocked his passage . After a struggle , MacLeod overcame the fairy and passed over the river . He then became friends with her . Before they parted , the fairy maiden gave him a box of scented wood ; this box , she told him , held several other smaller boxes , which fitted inside one another . She told him that the innermost box contained a magic banner , which when waved would bring forth a host of armed men to aid its owner . The fairy warned the MacLeod , that if he were to open the box within a year and a day from then , that no crops would grow on his land , no livestock would be born , as well as no children . When the MacLeod returned home he gave the box to the chief 's wife . The wife , however , ignored the MacLeod 's warning , and opened the box . Immediately a host of armed men appeared and that year , no children were born . The tradition concluded that ever since that time , the flag had been preserved for a time when such an army might mean salvation for the clan . 
 = = = = Unfurled numerous times = = = = 
 R.C. MacLeod wrote of another tradition which stated that the flag was waved at a battle in Waternish , in about 1580 ; and of another which told of how it was waved during a time when a cattle plague was raging , and that it stopped the murrain . R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice , and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay — because the MacLeods were on the losing side ! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been waved in 1600 , when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat .

 In 1938 , a fire broke out in a wing of Dunvegan Castle , and according to Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk , the flames were checked and extinguished when the flag was carried past to safety . During the Second World War , the chief of the clan , Dame Flora MacLeod of MacLeod , received a letter from a member of the clan who attributed his luck during bombing missions over Germany to a photo of the flag which he carried in his pocket . 
 = Humphrey ( cat ) = 
 Humphrey ( c . 1988 – March 2006 ) was a cat employed as the Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office at 10 Downing Street , the official residence of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , from October 1989 to 13 November 1997 . Arriving as a one @-@ year @-@ old stray , he served under the premierships of Margaret Thatcher , John Major and Tony Blair , retiring 6 months after the Blairs moved into Downing Street . He was the successor to Wilberforce . He was frequently referred to in jest by the press as an actual employee at Number 10 . 
 = = Start of employment = = 
 Humphrey was found as a stray by a Cabinet Office civil servant and named in honour of Sir Humphrey Appleby , the archetypal civil servant of Yes Minister and Yes , Prime Minister . After the death of the previous <unk> , Wilberforce , in 1988 the Cabinet Office and Number 10 were in need of a replacement and so Humphrey began his work . 
 At a cost of about £ 100 a year ( paid for from the Cabinet Office 's budget ) , most of which went towards food , Humphrey was said to be of considerably better value than the Cabinet 's professional pest controller , who charged £ 4 @,@ 000 a year and is reported to have never caught a mouse . Frequently pictured posing by the famous Number 10 front door , Humphrey 's primary duties involved catching mice and rats in the maze of Downing Street buildings . The poor quality of the buildings , some of which date from the 16th century , and the nearby St. James 's Park ensure a continuous vermin problem . By the time of his retirement , Humphrey had risen to the position of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office . 
 = = Humphrey 's problems = = 
 In November 1993 , an internal memo was circulated in the Cabinet Office informing staff that Humphrey was suffering from a minor kidney complaint and had been put on a special diet . A ban on feeding him treats was instituted . 
 Humphrey was accused on 7 June 1994 , of having killed four robin chicks , which were nesting in a window box outside the office of John Major , then Prime Minister . However , Major exonerated him the next day , declaring , " I am afraid Humphrey has been falsely accused . " It was not until 2006 that he was finally cleared : journalist George Jones of The Daily Telegraph admitted that his piece in the paper 's diary column had been no more than " journalistic licence " printed with no supporting evidence . In September 1994 Humphrey was found in St. James 's Park and was blamed for having " savaged " a duck there , earlier in the year . 
 = = Goes missing = = 
 In June 1995 , Humphrey went missing . Downing Street did not disclose the fact until it was mentioned to Sheila Gunn , a journalist on The Times , after Gunn told a member of staff that her own cat had died . Gunn 's story was mentioned on the front page . The publicity led to his rediscovery in the nearby Royal Army Medical College , where he had been taken in as a presumed stray and renamed PC , short for " patrol cat " . Upon his return , Humphrey issued a statement through the civil service stating , " I have had a wonderful holiday at the Royal Army Medical College , but it is nice to be back and I am looking forward to the new parliamentary session . " 
 = = Humphrey and the Blairs = = 
 Within a week of Tony Blair moving to 10 Downing Street after the May 1997 general election , press reports of a rift between Humphrey and Cherie Blair , the new Prime Minister 's wife , emerged . Mrs Blair was reported to either be allergic to cats or to believe them to be unhygienic . Sheila Gunn , who had gone on to be John Major 's press advisor , later admitted that she was the source of these reports which her obituary says were based " on a hunch for which she had no evidence " . 
 At the time , a spokesperson insisted that Humphrey would not be moving out , stating that Number 10 " is Humphrey 's home and , as far as the Blairs are concerned , it will remain his home " . A photo of Humphrey and Mrs Blair was released , though this did little to allay fears that he would be forced out . Allegations were later made that Humphrey was sedated by press secretary Alastair Campbell before undergoing the ordeal . The photo was used on the cover of Private Eye with Humphrey stating ' I am going to hit the mouse running ' a paraphrase of a New Labour @-@ ism . 
 In November 1997 , Humphrey 's primary carer , Jonathan Rees , who worked in the Prime Minister 's Policy Unit , wrote a memo stating that the cat should retire to a " stable home environment where he can be looked after properly " . While his continuing kidney problems were given as the reason for his retirement , many believed that Mrs Blair was behind the decision . 
 = = Rumours of murder = = 
 Humphrey moved to his new home with an elderly couple in suburban London on 13 November 1997 , though his retirement was not announced until the next day to reduce the risk of kidnap attempts . The Conservatives were quick to point out that Humphrey lived happily at Number 10 for almost eight years under a Conservative government but moved out within six months of Labour taking power . 
 Conservative MP and animal lover Alan Clark was suspicious about the way Humphrey 's retirement was announced and demanded proof that the cat was still alive : " Humphrey is now a missing person . Unless I hear from him or he makes a public appearance , I suspect he has been shot . " This led to rumours that Humphrey had been put down on the orders of Mrs Blair . 
 The Prime Minister 's office insisted that veterinary advice was behind the decision to remove Humphrey from Downing Street , and on 24 November 1997 a group of journalists was taken to a secret location in south London and shown that Humphrey was still alive and well . Pictures of the cat posing with copies of the day 's newspapers were published and reports indicated that he had put on weight . 
 = = In retirement = = 
 Little was heard about Humphrey over the next few years , leading many to infer that he had died . The Daily Telegraph made a Freedom of Information Act request for documents relating to him in early 2005 , which led to more information about his time at Downing Street coming to light . In its March 2005 report about Humphrey , the Telegraph lamented " Where Humphrey is now – or even whether he is still with us – remains a mystery . ' I am not having much luck , ' a Cabinet Office spokesman confessed last night . His official minder has not heard from him in seven years . " However , on 22 July 2005 , The Independent reported that " the 17 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> is alive and well and living in south London . " No further details were given in the text , which was part of a larger feature about celebrity pets . 
 In March 2006 , a spokesman for Tony Blair reported that Humphrey had died during the previous week , at the home of the Cabinet Office worker who had been accommodating him .

 In September 2007 , the first Downing Street cat since Humphrey was introduced ; Sybil moved from Edinburgh with Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and family . She shared a thespian name like her predecessor , being named after Sybil Fawlty from Fawlty Towers . Sybil returned to Edinburgh in early 2009 as she did not settle . Sybil died in July 2009 . 
 In February 2011 , a new cat was welcomed into Downing Street from London 's Battersea Dogs and Cats Home . Larry arrived following weeks of speculation about potential pest control measures after a large black rat was seen scuttling past No 10 . 
 = Scharnhorst @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Scharnhorst class was the last traditional class of armored cruisers built by the Kaiserliche Marine . The class comprised two ships , Scharnhorst and Gneisenau . They were larger than the Roon @-@ class cruisers that preceded them ; the extra size was used primarily to increase the main armament of 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 2 inch ) guns from four to eight . The ships were the first German cruiser to reach equality with their British counterparts . The ships were named after 19th century Prussian army reformers , Gerhard von Scharnhorst and August von Gneisenau . 
 Built for overseas service , Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were assigned to the East Asia Squadron in 1909 and 1910 , respectively . Scharnhorst relieved the old armored cruiser Fürst Bismarck as the squadron flagship , which had been on station since 1900 . Both ships had short careers ; shortly before the outbreak of World War I , the ships departed the German colony at Tsingtao . On 1 November 1914 , the ships destroyed a British force at the Battle of Coronel and inflicted upon the Royal Navy its first defeat since the Battle of Plattsburgh in 1814 . The East Asia Squadron , including both Scharnhorst @-@ class ships , was subsequently annihilated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The ships of the class were 144 @.@ 6 meters ( 474 ft ) long overall , and 143 @.@ 8 m ( 472 ft ) long at the waterline . They had a beam of 21 @.@ 6 m ( 71 ft ) , a draft of 8 @.@ 4 m ( 27 ft 7 in ) , and displaced 11 @,@ 616 metric tons ( 11 @,@ 433 long tons ; 12 @,@ 804 short tons ) standard , and 12 @,@ 985 t ( 12 @,@ 780 long tons ; 14 @,@ 314 short tons ) at full load . The ships ' hulls were constructed of transverse and longitudinal steel frames , over which the outer hull plating was riveted . The vessels had 15 watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 50 % of the length of the hull . 
 The ships had a standard crew of 38 officers and 726 enlisted men . Scharnhorst , as the squadron flagship , had a larger crew , including an additional 14 officers and 62 men . Gneisenau , when serving as the squadron second command flagship , had an extra staff of 3 officers and 25 men . The ships carried a number of smaller vessels , including two picket boats , two launches , one pinnace , two cutters , three yawls , and one dinghy . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 The Scharnhorst @-@ class ships used the same powerplant as in the preceding Roon class : three 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines . Each engine drove a single propeller ; the center shaft on Scharnhorst was 4 @.@ 7 m ( 15 ft ) in diameter while the outer two were 5 m ( 16 ft ) wide . Gneisenau 's screws were slightly smaller , at 4 @.@ 6 m ( 15 ft ) wide on the center shaft and 4 @.@ 8 m ( 16 ft ) on the outer pair . The triple expansion engines were supplied with steam by 18 coal @-@ fired marine @-@ type boilers with 36 fire boxes . The engines were designed to provide 26 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower , though on trials they achieved higher figures — 28 @,@ 782 ihp for Scharnhorst and 30 @,@ 396 ihp for Gneisenau . The ships were rated at a top speed of 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) , though on trials Scharnhorst steamed at a maximum of 23 @.@ 5 knots ( 43 @.@ 5 km / h ; 27 @.@ 0 mph ) , while Gneisenau ran at 23 @.@ 6 knots ( 43 @.@ 7 km / h ; 27 @.@ 2 mph ) . The vessels carried 800 t ( 790 long tons ; 880 short tons ) of coal normally , though they were capable of storing up to 2 @,@ 000 t ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ; 2 @,@ 200 short tons ) of coal . This provided a maximum range of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at a cruising speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . The ships had a single rudder . 
 The vessels also carried the same electrical plant as in the older Roon @-@ class ships . It consisted of four turbo @-@ generators that delivered 260 kilowatts at 110 volts . The Scharnhorst @-@ class ships were the last cruisers built by Germany to be equipped with generators that put out power at 110 volts ; the subsequent design , Blücher , had generators that ran at 225 volts . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships ' main battery armament consisted of eight 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) SK L / 40 guns , four in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the main superstructure , and the remaining four were mounted in single wing turrets . The 21 cm guns fired a 108 kg ( 238 lb ) armor @-@ piercing projectile at a muzzle velocity of 780 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . The guns had a rate of fire of between 4 – 5 rounds per minute . The guns were supplied with a total of 700 rounds . The guns mounted in the twin turrets could elevate to 30 degrees , which enabled a maximum range of 16 @,@ 300 metres ( 17 @,@ 800 yd ) . The single turrets could only elevate to 16 degrees , and so their range was correspondingly lower at 12 @,@ 400 metres ( 13 @,@ 600 yd ) . The twin turrets could train to approximately 150 degrees in either direction from the centerline . 
 Secondary armament included six 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK L / 40 guns in MPL casemates . These guns had a fired armor @-@ piercing shells at a rate of 4 – 5 per minute . The ships carried 170 shells per gun , for a total of 1 @,@ 020 rounds total . The guns could depress to − 7 degrees and elevate to 20 degrees , for a maximum range of 13 @,@ 700 metres ( 15 @,@ 000 yd ) . They were manually elevated and trained . 
 The ships were also armed with eighteen 8 @.@ 8 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns mounted in casemates . They fired 10 kg ( 22 lb ) shells at a muzzle velocity of approximately 620 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) . The ship carried 150 shells per gun , for a total of 2 @,@ 700 rounds . They were capable of engaging targets out to 11 @,@ 000 m ( 12 @,@ 000 yd ) . As with the larger 15 cm guns , the 8 @.@ 8 cm weapons were manually elevated and trained . 
 As was customary for warships of the period , the Scharnhorst @-@ class ships were equipped with four 45 cm ( 18 in ) submerged torpedo tubes . One was mounted in the bow , one on each broadside , and the fourth was placed in the stern . The ships were supplied with a total of 11 torpedoes . The weapons were the C / 03 type , which weighed 662 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 459 lb ) and carried a 176 kilograms ( 388 lb ) high @-@ explosive warhead . At a speed of 31 knots ( 57 km / h ; 36 mph ) , the torpedoes had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 yd ) ; when set at a slower speed of 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , the weapons could hit targets out to twice the distance , at 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 yd ) . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 As was the standard for German warships , the ships of the Scharnhorst class were protected by Krupp armor . They had an armor belt that was 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick in the central portion of the ship , where the most important areas were located . The belt decreased to 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) on either end of the central citadel , and down to nothing at the bow and stern . The entire belt was backed with teak planking . The main armored deck ranged in thickness from 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) over critical areas and down to 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) elsewhere . The deck sloped down to the belt ; this portion was between 40 – 55 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The forward conning tower had 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and a 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick roof . The rear conning tower was less well @-@ armored , with sides that were only 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick and a roof that was 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick . The main battery gun turrets had 170 mm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) thick sides and 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick roofs , while the amidships guns were protected with 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick gun shields and 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick roofs . The 15 cm guns were armored with 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick shields .

 Upon commissioning , both ships of the class were assigned to the German East Asia Squadron , with Scharnhorst serving as Admiral Maximilian von Spee 's flagship . Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were regarded as well @-@ trained vessels ; both ships won awards for their excellence at gunnery . At the start of World War I , the two ships were in the Caroline Islands on a routine cruise ; the rest of von Spee 's squadron was dispersed around the Pacific . The declaration of war by Japan on Germany convinced von Spee to consolidate his force with the cruisers Leipzig and Dresden from the American station , and head for Chile to refuel . The flotilla would then attempt to return to Germany via the Atlantic Ocean . Admiral von Spee also intended to attack the three British cruisers under the command of Admiral Christopher Cradock , and any British shipping encountered . On 22 September , Scharnhorst and Gneisenau approached the island of Papeete in French Polynesia with the intention of seizing the coal stockpiled in the harbor . The ships conducted a short bombardment that resulted in the sinking of the old gunboat Zélée . However , von Spee feared that the harbor had been mined , and decided to avoid the risk . The French had also set fire to the coal stocks to prevent the Germans from using the coal . 
 = = = Battle of Coronel = = = 
 At approximately 17 : 00 on 1 November 1914 , the East Asia Squadron encountered Cradock 's ships off Coronel . Because the German ships had an advantage in speed , von Spee was able to keep the distance to 18 kilometers , before closing to 12 km ( 1 @.@ 2 × 1013 nm ) to engage the British flotilla at 19 : 00 . Scharnhorst hit Good Hope some 34 times ; at least one of the shells penetrated Good Hope 's ammunition magazines , which resulted in a tremendous explosion that destroyed the ship . The light cruiser Nürnberg closed to point @-@ blank range to attack Monmouth ; after a severe pummeling , Monmouth sank as well . The British light cruiser Glasgow and the auxiliary cruiser Otranto both escaped under the cover of darkness . First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher remarked that it was " the saddest naval action of the war . " The defeat was the first to be inflicted on the Royal Navy since the 1814 Battle of Plattsburgh . After news of the battle reached Kaiser Wilhelm II in Berlin , he ordered 300 Iron Crosses to be awarded to the men of von Spee 's squadron . After refueling in Valparaiso , the East Asia Squadron departed for the Falkland Islands , in order to destroy the British wireless transmitter located there . 
 = = = Battle of the Falkland Islands = = = 
 Some six hours after news of the battle reached England , Admiral Fisher ordered Admiral John Jellicoe , the commander of the Grand Fleet , to detach the battlecruisers Invincible and Inflexible to hunt down the German ships . Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee was placed in command of the flotilla , which also included the armored cruisers Carnarvon , Cornwall , Defence , and Kent , and the light cruisers Bristol and Glasgow , which had survived Coronel . Sturdee 's ships reached the Falklands by the morning of 8 December , shortly before von Spee 's squadron arrived . The British spotted the East Asia Squadron at 09 : 40 ; von Spee was unaware that the British had sent the two battlecruisers , and when he observed them , he ordered his ships to withdraw . Despite the head start , the fast battlecruisers quickly caught up with the worn @-@ out German ships , which had just completed a 16 @,@ 000 mile voyage without repairs . 
 At approximately 13 : 20 , the battlecruisers opened fire at a range of 14 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) . After a two @-@ hour @-@ long battle , Scharnhorst was dead in the water and listing heavily . The ship was sunk shortly thereafter . Gneisenau had been hit more than 50 times at close range ; the crew gave three cheers for the Kaiser before the vessel sank . Nürnberg and Leipzig were also sunk , though Dresden managed to escape temporarily , before she too was destroyed off Juan Fernández Island . Some 2 @,@ 200 men were killed , among them Admiral von Spee . 
 = Livonian War = 
 The Livonian War ( 1558 – 1583 ) was fought for control of Old Livonia ( in the territory of present @-@ day Estonia and Latvia ) when the Tsardom of Russia faced off against a varying coalition of Denmark – Norway , the Kingdom of Sweden , the Union ( later Commonwealth ) of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland . 
 During the period 1558 – 1578 , Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat ( Tartu ) and Narva . Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland – Lithuania into the conflict while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561 . Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of Ösel – Wiek , which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein . Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia , which nominally existed until Magnus ' defection in 1576 . 
 In 1576 , Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581 , including the joint Swedish – Polish – Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden . This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov . Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski , which ended the war between Russia and Poland – Lithuania , Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland – Lithuania . The following year , Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia .

 By the mid @-@ 16th century , economically prosperous Old Livonia had become a region organised into the decentralised and religiously divided Livonian Confederation . Its territories consisted of the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order , the prince @-@ bishoprics of Dorpat , Ösel – Wiek , as well as Courland , the Archbishopric of Riga and the city of Riga . Together with Riga , the cities of Dorpat and Reval ( Tallinn ) , along with the knightly estates , enjoyed privileges enabling them to act almost independently . The only common institutions of the Livonian estates were the regularly held common assemblies known as <unk> . As well as a divided political administration , there were also persistent rivalries between the archbishop of Riga and the landmeister of the Order for hegemony . A schism had existed within the Order since the Reformation had spread to Livonia in the 1520s , although the transformation of the country into a Lutheran region was a gradual process , resisted by part of the Order which to a varying degree remained sympathetic to Roman Catholicism . As war approached , Livonia had a weak administration subject to internal rivalries , lacked any powerful defences or outside support , and was surrounded by monarchies pursuing expansionist policies . Robert I. Frost notes of the volatile region : " Racked with internal bickering and threatened by the political machinations of its neighbours , Livonia was in no state to resist an attack . " 
 The Order 's landmeister and <unk> , as well as the owners of Livonian estates , were all lesser nobles who guarded their privileges and influence by preventing the creation of a higher , more powerful noble class . Only the archbishopric of Riga successfully overcame resistance of the lesser nobles . Wilhelm von Brandenburg was appointed as archbishop of Riga and Christoph von Mecklenburg as his coadjutor , with the help of his brother Albert ( Albrecht ) of Brandenburg – Ansbach , the former Prussian <unk> who had secularised the southern Teutonic Order state and in 1525 established himself as duke in Prussia . Wilhelm and Christoph were to pursue Albert 's interests in Livonia , among which was the establishment of a hereditary Livonian duchy styled after the Prussian model . At the same time the Order agitated for its re @-@ establishment ( " <unk> " ) in Prussia , opposed secularization and creation of a hereditary duchy .

 By the time the Livonian War broke out , the Hanseatic League had already lost its monopoly on the profitable and prosperous Baltic Sea trade . While still involved and with increasing sales , it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets , most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France . The Hanseatic vessels were no match for contemporary warships , and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade , its Livonian members Riga , Reval and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection . The Danish navy , the most powerful in the Baltic Sea , controlled the entrance to the Baltic Sea , collected requisite tolls and held the strategically important Baltic Sea islands of Bornholm and Gotland . 
 A long bar of Danish territories in the south and her lack of sufficient year @-@ round ice @-@ free ports severely limited Sweden 's access to the Baltic trade . Nevertheless , the country prospered due to exports of timber , iron and most notably copper , coupled with the advantages of a growing navy and proximity to the Livonian ports across the narrow Gulf of Finland . Before the Livonian war , Sweden had sought expansion into Livonia , but the intervention of the Russian Tsar temporarily stalled these efforts through the Russo @-@ Swedish War of 1554 – 1557 , which culminated in the 1557 Treaty of Novgorod . 
 Through its absorption of the principalities of Novgorod ( 1478 ) and Pskov ( 1510 ) , the Tsardom of Russia had become Livonia 's eastern neighbour and grown stronger after annexing the khanates of Kazan ( 1552 ) and Astrakhan ( 1556 ) . The conflict between Russia and the Western powers was exacerbated by Russia 's isolation from sea trade . The new Ivangorod port built by Tsar Ivan on the eastern shore of the Narva River in 1550 was considered unsatisfactory on account of its shallow waters . Thereafter the Tsar demanded that the Livonian Confederation pay about 6 @,@ 000 marks to keep the Bishopric of Dorpat , based on the claim that every adult male had paid Pskov one mark when it had been an independent state . The <unk> eventually promised to pay this sum to Ivan by 1557 , but were sent from Moscow when they failed to do so , ending negotiations . Ivan continued to point out that the existence of the Order required passive Russian support , and was quick to threaten use of military force if necessary . He aimed to establish a corridor between the Baltic and the new territories on the Caspian Sea because if Russia were to engage in open conflict with major western powers , it would need imports of more sophisticated weaponry . 
 The Polish King and Lithuanian Grand Duke Sigismund II Augustus was wary of Russian expansionist aspirations . Expansion of Russia into Livonia would have meant not only a stronger political rival but also loss of lucrative trade routes . Therefore , Sigismund supported his cousin Wilhelm von Brandenburg , archbishop of Riga , in his conflicts with Wilhelm von Fürstenberg , the Livonian Order 's landmeister . Sigismund hoped that Livonia , just like the Duchy of Prussia under Duke Albert , would become a vassal state of Poland – Lithuania . With weak support in Livonia , von Brandenburg had to largely rely on external allies . Among his few Livonian supporters was <unk> Jasper von Munster , with whom he planned an April 1556 attack on his opponents that would involve military aid from both Sigismund and Albert . However , Sigismund hesitated over participation in the action , fearing that it would leave the Kiev Voivodeship exposed to a pending Russian attack . When von Fürstenberg learned of the plan , he led a force into the archbishopric of Riga and in June 1556 captured the main strongholds of <unk> and <unk> . Jasper von Munster fled to Lithuania , but von Brandenburg and Christoph von Mecklenburg were captured and detained at <unk> and <unk> . This resulted in a diplomatic mission to petition for their release being dispatched by the Pomeranian dukes , the Danish King , Emperor Ferdinand I and the estates of the Holy Roman Empire . A cross @-@ party meeting in Lübeck to resolve the conflict was scheduled for 1 April 1557 , but was cancelled due to quarrels between Sigismund and the Danish envoys . Sigismund used the killing of his envoy <unk> by the landmeister 's son as an excuse to invade the southern portion of Livonia with an army of around 80 @,@ 000 . He forced the competing parties in Livonia to reconcile at his camp in Pozvol in September 1557 . There they signed the Treaty of Pozvol , which created a mutual defensive and offensive alliance , with its primary target Russia , and provoked the Livonian War .

 = = = Russian invasion of Livonia = = = 
 Ivan IV regarded the Livonian Confederation 's approach to the Polish – Lithuanian union for protection under the Treaty of Pozvol as casus belli . - in 1554 Livonia and Russia had signed a fifteen @-@ year truce in which Livonia agreed not to enter into an alliance with Poland – Lithuania . In January 1558 , Ivan reacted with the invasion of Livonia . The Russians were seen by local peasants as liberators from the German control of Livonia . Many Livonian fortresses surrendered without resistance while Russian troops took Dorpat in May , Narva in July , and laid siege to Reval . Reinforced by 1 @,@ 200 <unk> , 100 gunners and ammunition from Germany , Livonian forces successfully retook Wesenberg ( Rakvere ) along with a number of other fortresses . Although the Germans raided Russian territory , Dorpat , Narva and many lesser fortresses remained in Russian hands . The initial Russian advance was led by the Khan of <unk> <unk> , with two other Tartar princes at the head of a force that included Russian <unk> , Tartar and <unk> 'e cavalry as well as cossacks , who at that time were mostly armed foot soldiers . Ivan gained further ground in campaigns during the years 1559 and 1560 . In January 1559 , Russian forces again invaded Livonia . A six @-@ month truce covering May to November was signed between Russia and Livonia while Russia fought in the Russo @-@ Crimean Wars . 
 Prompted by the Russian invasion , Livonia first unsuccessfully sought help from Emperor Ferdinand I , then turned to Poland – Lithuania . <unk> von <unk> fled to Poland – Lithuania to be replaced by Gotthard Kettler . In June 1559 , the estates of Livonia came under Polish – Lithuanian protection through the first Treaty of Vilnius ( Vilna ) . The Polish sejm refused to agree to the treaty , believing it to be a matter affecting only the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . In January 1560 , Sigismund sent ambassador Martin <unk> to the court of Ivan in Moscow in an attempt to stop the Russian cavalry rampaging through rural Livonia . 
 Russian successes followed similar patterns featuring a multitude of small campaigns , with sieges where <unk> played a key role in destroying wooden defences with effective artillery support . The Tsar 's forces took important fortresses like Fellin ( Viljandi ) , yet lacked the means to gain the major cities of Riga , Reval or Pernau . The Livonian knights suffered a disastrous defeat by the Russians at the Battle of <unk> in August 1560 . Some historians believe the Russian nobility were split over the timing of the invasion of Livonia . 
 Eric XIV , the new King of Sweden , turned down Kettler 's requests for assistance , along with a similar request from Poland . Kettler turned to Sigismund for help . The weakened Livonian Order was dissolved by the second Treaty of Vilnius in 1561 . Its lands were secularised as the Duchy of Livonia and Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and assigned to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . Kettler became the first Duke of Courland , in doing so converting to Lutheranism . Included in the treaty was the <unk> <unk> Augusti by which Sigismund guaranteed the Livonian estates privileges including religious freedom with respect to the Augsburg Confession , the <unk> , and continuation of the traditional German administration . The terms regarding religious freedom forbade any regulation of the Protestant order by religious or secular authorities . 
 Some members of the Lithuanian nobility opposed growing Polish – Lithuanian union , and offered the Lithuanian crown to Ivan IV . The Tsar publicly advertised this option , either because he took the offer seriously , or because he needed time to strengthen his Livonian troops . Throughout 1561 , a Russo @-@ Lithuanian truce ( with a scheduled expiration date of 1562 ) was respected by both sides . 
 = = = Danish and Swedish interventions = = = 
 In return for a loan and a guarantee of Danish protection , Bishop Johann von Münchhausen signed a treaty on 26 September 1559 giving Frederick II of Denmark the right to nominate the bishop of Ösel – Wiek , an act which amounted to the sale of these territories for 30 @,@ 000 thalers . Frederick II nominated his brother , Duke Magnus of Holstein as bishop , who then took possession in April 1560 . Lest Danish efforts create more insecurity for Sweden , Denmark made another attempt to mediate a peace in the region . Magnus at once pursued his own interests , purchasing the Bishopric of Courland without Frederick 's consent and trying to expand into <unk> – <unk> ( <unk> and <unk> ) . This brought him into direct conflict with Eric . 
 In 1561 , Swedish forces arrived and the noble corporations of <unk> – <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) yielded to Sweden to form the Duchy of Estonia . Reval , similarly , accepted Swedish rule . Denmark dominated the Baltic , and Sweden wished to challenge this by gaining territory on the Eastern side of the Baltic . Doing so would help Sweden control the West 's trade with Russia . This helped to precipitate the Northern Seven Years ' War since in 1561 , Frederick II had already protested against Swedish presence in Reval , claiming historical rights relating to Danish Estonia . When Erik XIV 's forces seized Pernau in June 1562 , his diplomats tried to arrange Swedish protection for Riga which brought him into conflict with Sigismund . 
 Sigismund maintained close relations with Erik XIV 's brother , John , Duke of Finland ( later John III ) and in October 1562 , John married Sigismund 's sister , Catherine , thereby preventing her marrying Ivan IV . While Erik XIV had approved the marriage , he was upset when John lent Sigismund 120 @,@ 000 dalers and received seven Livonian castles as security . This incident led to John 's capture and imprisonment in August 1563 on Erik XIV 's behalf , whereupon Sigismund allied with Denmark and Lübeck against Erik XIV in October the same year . 
 = = 1562 – 1570 = = 
 The intervention of Denmark , Sweden and Poland @-@ Lithuania into Livonia began a period of struggle for control of the Baltic , known contemporaneously as the dominium maris baltici . While the initial war years were characterised by intensive fighting , a period of low @-@ intensity warfare began in 1562 and lasted until 1570 when fighting once more intensified . Denmark , Sweden and to some extent Poland – Lithuania were occupied with the Nordic Seven Years ' War ( 1563 – 1570 ) taking place in the Western Baltic , but Livonia remained strategically important . In 1562 , Denmark and Russia concluded the Treaty of Mozhaysk , respecting each other 's claims in Livonia and maintaining amicable relations . In 1564 , Sweden and Russia concluded a seven @-@ years truce . Both Ivan IV and Eric XIV showed signs of mental disorder with Ivan IV and turning against part of the Tsardom 's nobility and people with the <unk> that began in 1565 , leaving Russia in a state of political chaos and civil war . 
 = = = Russian war with Lithuania = = = 
 When the Russo @-@ Lithuanian truce expired in 1562 , Ivan IV rejected Sigismund 's offer of an extension . The Tsar had used the period of the truce to build up his forces in Livonia , and invaded Lithuania . His army raided Vitebsk and , after a series of border clashes , took Polotsk in 1563 . Lithuanian victories came at the Battle of Ula in 1564 and at <unk> ( <unk> ) in 1567 , a period of intermittent conflict between the two sides . Ivan continued to gain ground among the towns and villages of central Livonia but was held at the coast by Lithuania . The defeats of Ula and <unk> , along with the defection of Andrey <unk> , led Ivan IV to move his capital to the Alexandrov Kremlin while the perceived opposition against him was repressed by his <unk> . 
 A " grand " party of diplomats left Lithuania for Moscow in May 1566 . Lithuania was prepared to split Livonia with Russia , with a view to a joint offensive to drive Sweden from the area . However , this was seen as a sign of weakness by Russian diplomats , who instead suggested that Russia take the whole of Livonia , including Riga , through the ceding of Courland in southern Livonia and Polotsk on the Lithuanian – Russian border . The transfer of Riga , and the surrounding entrance to the River Dvina , troubled the Lithuanians , since much of their trade depended on safe passage through it and they had already built fortifications to protect it . Ivan expanded his demands in July , calling for Ösel in addition to Dorpat and Narva . No agreement was forthcoming and a ten @-@ day break was taken in negotiations , during which time various Russian meetings were held ( including the <unk> <unk> , the Assembly of the Land ) to discuss the issues at stake . Within the Assembly , the church 's representative stressed the need to " keep " Riga ( it not yet having been conquered ) while the Boyars were less keen on an overall peace with Lithuania , noting the danger posed by a joint Polish @-@ Lithuanian state . Talks were then halted and hostilities resumed upon the ambassadors ' return to Lithuania . 
 In 1569 , the Treaty of Lublin unified Poland and Lithuania into the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth . The Duchy of Livonia , tied to Lithuania in real union since the Union of Grodno in 1566 , came under Polish – Lithuanian joint sovereignty . In June 1570 a three @-@ year truce was signed with Russia . <unk> II , the Commonwealth 's first King , died in 1572 leaving the Polish throne with no clear successor for the first time since 1382 and thus began the first free election in Polish history . Some Lithuanian nobles , in an effort to retain Lithuanian autonomy , proposed a Russian candidate . Ivan , however , demanded the return of Kiev , an Orthodox coronation , and a hereditary monarchy in parallel to Russia 's , with his son , Fedor , as King . The electorate rejected these demands and instead chose Henry of Valois ( Henryk <unk> ) , brother of King Charles IX of France . 
 = = = Russian war with Sweden = = = 
 In 1564 , Sweden and Russia agreed the Treaty of Dorpat , whereby Russia recognised Sweden 's right to Reval and other castles , and Sweden accepted Russia 's patrimony over the rest of Livonia . A seven @-@ year truce was signed between Russia and Sweden in 1565 . Eric XIV of Sweden was overthrown in 1568 after he killed several nobles in the Sture Murders ( <unk> ) of 1567 , and was replaced by his half @-@ brother John III . Both Russia and Sweden had other problems , and were keen to avoid an expensive escalation of the war in Livonia . Ivan IV had requested the delivery of John 's wife , the Polish @-@ Lithuanian princess Catherine Jagellonica to Russia , since he had competed with John to marry into the Lithuanian @-@ Polish royal family . In July 1569 John sent a party to Russia , led by Paul Juusten , Bishop of Åbo which arrived in Novgorod in September , following the arrival in Moscow of the ambassadors sent to Sweden in 1567 by Ivan to retrieve Catherine . Ivan refused to meet with the party himself , forcing them to negotiate instead with the Governor of Novgorod . The Tsar requested that Swedish envoys should greet the governor as ' the brother of their king ' , but Juusten refused to do so . The Governor then ordered an attack on the Swedish party and that their clothes and money be taken , they be deprived of food and drink and be paraded naked through the streets . Although the Swedes were also to be moved to Moscow , fortunately for them , this occurred at the same time Ivan and his <unk> were on their way to an assault on Novgorod . 
 On his return to Moscow in May 1570 , Ivan refused to meet the Swedish party , and with the signing of a three @-@ year truce in June 1570 with the Commonwealth he no longer feared war with Poland – Lithuania . Russia considered the delivery of Catherine to be a precondition of any deal and the Swedes agreed to meet in Novgorod to discuss the matter . According to Juusten , at the meeting the Russians demanded they abandon their claim to Reval , provide two or three hundred cavalry when required , pay 10 @,@ 000 thaler in direct compensation , surrender Finnish silver mines near the border with Russia and allow the Tsar to style himself " Lord of Sweden " . The Swedish party left following an ultimatum from Ivan that Sweden should cede its territory in Livonia or there would be war . Juusten was left behind while John rejected Ivan 's demands , and war broke out anew . 
 = = = Impact of the Northern Seven Years ' War = = = 
 Quarrels between Denmark and Sweden had led to the Northern Seven Years ' War in 1563 which ended in 1570 with the Treaty of Stettin . Primarily fought in western and southern Scandinavia , the war involved important naval battles fought in the Baltic . When Danish @-@ held <unk> surrendered to Swedish forces in 1565 , 150 Danish mercenaries escaped the subsequent massacre of the garrison by defecting to Sweden . Among them was Pontus de la Gardie , who became an important Swedish commander in the Livonian War thereafter . Livonia was also affected by the naval campaign of Danish admiral Peter or Per Munck , who bombarded Swedish Reval from sea in July 1569 . 
 Under the Treaty of Stettin , Denmark became the supreme and dominating power in Northern Europe , yet failed to restore the Kalmar Union . Unfavourable conditions for Sweden led to a series of conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720 . Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II . However , Maximilian failed to pay the promised compensation , and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs . The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were ignored , and thus the Livonian War continued . From Ivan 's point of view , this merely enabled the powers involved to form an alliance against him , now that they were no longer fighting each other . 
 = = 1570 – 1577 : Russian dominance and the Kingdom of Livonia = = 
 During the early 1570s , King John III of Sweden , faced a Russian offensive on his positions in Estonia . Reval withstood a Russian siege in 1570 and 1571 , but several smaller towns were taken by Russian forces . At 23 January a Swedish army of 700 infantry and 600 cavalry under command of Clas Åkesson Tott ( the Elder ) clashed with an Russian and Tartar army of 16 @,@ 000 men under the command of Khan Sain @-@ Bulat at the Battle of Lode by the village of <unk> . The Russian advance concluded with the sacking of <unk> ( <unk> ) in 1573 where , after its capture , the occupying forces roasted some of the leaders of the Swedish garrison alive , including the commander . This triggered a retaliatory campaign by John centred on Wesenberg , to which the army departed in November 1573 with Klas Åkesson Tott in overall command and Pontus de la Gardie as field commander . There were also Russian raids into Finland , including one as far as Helsingfors ( Helsinki ) in 1572 . A two @-@ year truce on this front was signed in 1575 . 
 John 's counter @-@ offensive stalled at the siege of Wesenberg in 1574 when German and Scottish units of the Swedish army turned against each other . This failure has also been blamed on the difficulties of fighting in the bitter winter conditions , particularly for the infantry . The war in Livonia was a great financial burden for Sweden and by the end of 1573 , Sweden 's German mercenaries were owed 200 @,@ 000 daler . John gave them the castles of <unk> , Leal and Lode as security but when he failed to pay they were sold to Denmark . 
 Meanwhile , efforts by Magnus to besiege Swedish @-@ controlled Reval were faltering , with support from neither Ivan nor Magnus ' brother , Frederick II of Denmark forthcoming . Ivan 's attention was focused elsewhere while Frederick 's reluctance perhaps stemmed from a new spirit of Swedish – Danish unity which made him unwilling to invade Livonia on behalf of Magnus , whose state was a vassal of Russia . The siege was abandoned in March 1561 whereupon Swedish action in the Baltic escalated , with the passive backing of Sigismund , John 's brother @-@ in @-@ law . 
 At the same time Crimean Tatars devastated Russian territories and burned and looted Moscow during the Russo @-@ Crimean Wars . Drought and epidemics had fatally affected the Russian economy while <unk> had thoroughly disrupted the government . Following the defeat of Crimean and Nogai forces in 1572 , <unk> was wound down and with it the way Russian armies were formed also changed . Ivan IV had introduced a new strategy whereby he relied on tens of thousands of native troops , cossacks and <unk> instead of a few thousand skilled troops and mercenaries , as was the practice of his adversaries . 
 Ivan 's campaign reached its height in 1576 when another 30 @,@ 000 Russian soldiers crossed into Livonia in 1577 and devastated Danish areas in retaliation for the Danish acquisition of <unk> , Leal and Lode . Danish influence in Livonia ceased , as Frederick accepted deals with Sweden and Poland to end nominal Danish involvement . Swedish forces were besieged in Reval and central Livonia raided as far as Dünaburg ( Daugavpils ) , formally under Polish – Lithuanian control since the 1561 Treaty of Vilnius . The conquered territories submitted to Ivan or his vassal , Magnus , declared monarch of the Kingdom of Livonia in 1570 . Magnus defected from Ivan IV during the same year , having started to appropriate castles without consulting the Tsar . When <unk> ( Koknese ) submitted to Magnus to avoid fighting Ivan IV 's army , the Tsar sacked the town and executed its German commanders . The campaign then focussed on Wenden ( Cēsis , <unk> ) , " the heart of Livonia " , which as the former capital of the Livonian Order was not only of strategic importance , but also symbolic of Livonia itself .

 In 1576 , the Transylvanian prince Stefan Batory became King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania after a contested election to the joint Polish – Lithuanian throne with the Habsburg Emperor Maximilian II . Both Batory 's <unk> Anna Jagiellon and Maximilian II had been proclaimed elected to the same throne in December 1575 , three days apart ; Maximilan 's death in October 1576 prevented the conflict from escalating . Batory , ambitious to expel Ivan IV from Livonia , was constrained by the opposition of Danzig ( Gdansk ) , which resisted Batory 's accession with Danish support . The ensuing Danzig War of 1577 ended when Batory conceded further autonomous rights to the city in return for a payment of 200 @,@ 000 zloty . For a further 200 @,@ 000 zloty payment , he appointed Hohenzollern George Frederick as administrator of Prussia and secured the latter 's military support in the planned campaign against Russia . 
 Batory received only few soldiers from his Polish vassals and was forced to recruit mercenaries , primarily Poles , Hungarians , Bohemians , Germans and Wallachians . A separate Szekler brigade fought in Livonia . 
 Swedish King John III and Stefan Batory allied against Ivan IV in December 1577 , despite problems caused by the death of <unk> which meant that the issue of the substantial inheritance due to John 's wife , Catherine had not been resolved . Poland also claimed the whole of Livonia , without accepting Swedish rule of any part of it . The 120 @,@ 000 daler lent in 1562 had still not been repaid , despite Sigismund 's best intentions to settle it . 
 By November , Lithuanian forces moving northward had captured Dünaburg while a Polish – Swedish force took the town and castle of Wenden in early 1578 . Russian forces failed to retake the town in February , an attack followed by a Swedish offensive , targeting Pernau ( Pärnu ) , Dorpat and Novgorod among others . In September , Ivan responded by sending in an army of 18 @,@ 000 men , who recaptured <unk> ( <unk> ) from Sweden and then marched on Wenden . Upon their arrival at Wenden , the Russian army laid siege to the town , but was met by a relief force of around 6 @,@ 000 German , Polish and Swedish soldiers . In the ensuing Battle of Wenden , Russian casualties were severe with armaments and horses captured , leaving Ivan IV with his first time serious defeat in Livonia . 
 Batory accelerated the formation of the hussars , a new well @-@ organised cavalry troop that replaced the feudal levy . Similarly , he improved an already effective artillery system and recruited cossacks . Batory gathered 56 @,@ 000 troops , 30 @,@ 000 of them from Lithuania , for his first assault on Russia at Polotsk , as part of a wider campaign . With Ivan 's reserves in Pskov and Novgorod to guard against a possible Swedish invasion , the city fell on 30 August 1579 . Batory then appointed a close ally and powerful member of his court , Jan Zamoyski , to lead a force of 48 @,@ 000 including 25 @,@ 000 men from Lithuania , against the fortress of <unk> Luki which he went on to capture on 5 September 1580 . Without further significant resistance , garrisons such as Sokol , Velizh and <unk> fell quickly . In 1581 , the force besieged Pskov , a well @-@ fortified and heavily defended fortress . However , financial support from the Polish parliament was dropping , and Batory failed to lure Russian forces in Livonia out into open field before the onset of winter . Not realising that the Polish – Lithuanian advance was on the wane , Ivan signed the Truce of Jam Zapolski . 
 The failure of the Swedish siege of Narva in 1579 led to Pontus de la Gardie 's appointment as commander @-@ in @-@ chief . The towns of Kexholm and <unk> were taken by Swedish forces in 1580 then in 1581 , concurrent with the fall of Wesenberg , a mercenary army hired by Sweden recaptured the strategic city of Narva . A target of John III 's campaigns , since it could be attacked by both land and sea , the campaign made use of Sweden 's considerable fleet but later arguments over formal control in the long term hampered any alliance with Poland . Following la Gardie 's taking of the city , and in retaliation for previous Russian massacres , 7 @,@ 000 Russians were killed according to <unk> 's contemporary chronicle . The fall of Narva was followed by those of Ivangorod , Jama and <unk> , leaving Sweden content with its gains in Livonia . 
 = = = Truces of Jam Zapolski and Plussa = = = 
 Subsequent negotiations led by Jesuit papal legate Antonio Possevino resulted in the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski between Russia and the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth . This was a humiliation for the Tsar , in part because he requested the truce . Under the agreement Russia would surrender all areas in Livonia it still held and the city of Dorpat to the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , while Polotsk would remain under Commonwealth control . Any captured Swedish territory — specifically Narva — could be retained by the Russians and <unk> Luki would be returned from Batory 's control to Russia . Possevino made a half @-@ hearted attempt to get John III 's wishes taken into consideration , but this was vetoed by the Tsar , probably in collusion with Batory . The armistice , which fell short of a full peace arrangement , was to last ten years and was renewed twice , in 1591 and 1601 . Batory failed in his attempts to pressure Sweden into relinquishing its gains in Livonia , particularly Narva . 
 Following a decision by John , the war with Russia ended in 1583 when the Tsar concluded the Truce of Plussa ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) with Sweden . Russia relinquished most of Ingria but left Narva and Ivangorod under Swedish control . Originally scheduled to last three years , the Russo @-@ Swedish truce was later extended until 1590 . During the negotiations , Sweden made vast demands for Russian territory , including Novgorod . Whilst these conditions were probably only for the purposes of negotiation , they may have reflected Swedish aspirations of territory in the region . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The post @-@ war Duchy of Courland and Semigallia south of the Düna ( Daugava ) river experienced a period of political stability based on the 1561 Treaty of Vilnius , later modified by the 1617 Formula <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which granted indigenous nobles additional rights at the duke 's expense . North of the Düna , Batory reduced the privileges Sigismund had granted the Duchy of Livonia , regarding the regained territories as the spoils of war . Riga 's privileges had already been reduced by the Treaty of Drohiczyn in 1581 . Polish gradually replaced German as the administrative language and the establishment of voivodeships reduced the Baltic German administration . The local clergy and the Jesuits in Livonia embraced the counter @-@ reformation in a process assisted by Batory , who gave the Roman Catholic Church revenues and estates confiscated from Protestants as well as initiating a largely unsuccessful recruitment campaign for Catholic colonists . Despite these measures , the Livonian population did not convert en masse , while the Livonian estates in Poland – Lithuania were alienated . 
 In 1590 , the Russo @-@ Swedish truce of Plussa expired and fighting resumed while the ensuing Russo @-@ Swedish War of 1590 – 5 ended with the Treaty of <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , under which Sweden had to cede Ingria and Kexholm to Russia . The Swedish – Polish alliance began to crumble when the Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund III , who as son of John III of Sweden ( died 1592 ) and Catherine Jagellonica , was the successor to the Swedish throne , met with resistance from a faction led by his uncle , Charles of Södermanland ( later Charles IX ) , who claimed regency in Sweden for himself . Sweden descended into a civil war in 1597 , followed by the 1598 – 1599 war against Sigismund , which ended with the deposition of Sigismund by the Swedish <unk> . 
 Local nobles turned to Charles for protection in 1600 when the conflict spread to Livonia , where Sigismund had tried to incorporate Swedish Estonia into the Duchy of Livonia . Charles then expelled the Polish forces from Estonia and invaded the Livonian duchy , starting a series of Polish – Swedish wars . At the same time , Russia was embroiled in civil war over the vacant Russian throne ( " Time of Troubles " ) when none of the many claimants had prevailed . This conflict became intertwined with the Livonian campaigns when Swedish and Polish – Lithuanian forces intervened on opposite sides , the latter starting the Polish – Muscovite War . Charles IX 's forces were expelled from Livonia after major setbacks at the battles of Kircholm ( 1605 ) and Klushino ( 1610 ) . During the later Ingrian War , Charles ' successor Gustavus Adolphus retook Ingria and Kexholm which were formally ceded to Sweden under the 1617 Treaty of <unk> along with the bulk of the Duchy of Livonia . In 1617 , when Sweden had recovered from the Kalmar War with Denmark , several Livonian towns were captured , but only Pernau remained under Swedish control after a Polish – Lithuanian counter @-@ offensive a second campaign that started with the capture of Riga in 1621 and expelled Polish – Lithuanian forces from most of Livonia , where the dominion of Swedish Livonia was created . Swedish forces then advanced through Royal Prussia and Poland – Lithuania accepted Swedish gains in Livonia in the 1629 Treaty of Altmark . 
 The Danish province of <unk> was ceded to Sweden under the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro , which ended the Torstenson War , one theatre of the Thirty Years ' War . It was retained after the Peace of Oliva and the Treaty of Copenhagen , both in 1660 . The situation remained unchanged until 1710 when Estonia and Livonia capitulated to Russia during the Great Northern War , an action formalised in the Treaty of Nystad ( 1721 ) .

 " Mi Chico Latino " ( English : " My Latin Boy " ) , is a song recorded by English singer Geri Halliwell for her debut solo album Schizophonic ( 1999 ) . It was written by Halliwell , Andy Watkins and Paul Wilson , whilst produced by the latter two , who are known collectively as Absolute . " Mi Chico Latino " was released as the album 's second single on 16 August 1999 , by EMI . It is a Latin pop song which is centred on a lost love theme .

 " Mi Chico Latino " was written by Halliwell , Andy Watkins and Paul Wilson in the autumn of 1998 . The singer wanted to make a song with Spanish influences , in order to pay homage for her Spanish mother . During a day in the studio , they came up with a melody but did not have any words . Then she called her mother for help . Halliwell recalled asking her , " Mum , what do you say to a bloke in Spanish if you fancy him and are being romantic ? " Her mother then said she did not remember that . So she asked her look at her library of Spanish language romances , and she read the titles out to Halliwell . Eventually she came out with " ¿ Dónde está el hombre con fuego en la sangre ? " ( " Where is the man with fire in his blood ? " in English ) , and she liked the way it sounded , and included the line at the beginning of the song . After " Look at Me " peaked only at number two , her record company wanted her to release " Lift Me Up " , while the Absolute team wanted " Bag It Up " , but she chose to release " Mi Chico Latino " after receiving good reception from children . She also thought , 
 " First and foremost I thought it was a good record . It was poppy and catchy and perfect for the summer . I think my core audience is young teenage girls and gay guys . Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that 's what ' Chico ' was . It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of ' Look at Me ' . [ ... ] The other thing that ' Chico ' had going for it was that the music was Latin @-@ based , I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin @-@ influenced music was ruling the charts . Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way . So it was a strange example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before " .

 " Mi Chico Latino " is a Latin pop song which moves at a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute . At the beginning of the song , Halliwell chants the spoken word line " ¿ Dónde está el hombre con fuego en la sangre ? " . The lyrics to the song are centred on a lost love theme , with castanets in the background . During the song , the singer also sings in Italian on its chorus , when everything else is Spanish . According to biographer David Sinclair in his book Spice Girls Revisited : How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop , Halliwell continued to explore the Riviera @-@ pop theme of the Spice Girls ' song , " Viva Forever " , whilst " murmuring sweet nothings in a peculiar brand of estuary Spanish while castanets and timbales clattered alongside a cod @-@ flamenco guitar " .

 In 1999 , Israeli singer Alabina said " Mi Chico Latino " was a plagiarism from her song " Alabina ( De La Noche A La Manana ) " , released the year before . A spokesman for Alabina 's French record label Atal said that they were " anxiously contacting " Halliwell 's record label about the songs ' similarities . However , no legal actions were made .

 " Mi Chico Latino " received mixed reviews from music critics . Jon Perks , whilst reviewing Schizophonic for Sunday Mercury , gave a positive review , stating , " Okay , so it sounds like a hybrid of La Vida Loca and Madonna 's La Isla Bonita , but with a swimming @-@ costumed Geri on the cover and a summery tune , it 's a winning combination " . Chris Charles from BBC News commented that " Mi Chico Latino " could be mistaken with " Spice Up Your Life " , Halliwell 's previous hit with the Spice Girls . For Russell Baillie from The New Zealand Herald , Halliwell spends time on the album " flashing her eyelashes at [ menfolk ] , especially if they 're foreign " , calling the song " glutinous " . According to Rolling Stone , " Mi Chico Latino " was her " impeccably timed contribution to the Latin @-@ pop phenom , complete with awkwardly pronounced Spanglish " . Jonathan O 'Brien from Hot Press magazine was negative , stating that " Mi Chico Latino " was " a dreadful pastiche of Madonna 's ' La Isla Bonita ' " .

According to her , the video was also pretty easy to get : " a yacht , a girl in a bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [ gay guys and teenage girls ] happy " . After the video was released , the singer got a huge amount of attention from it . " People came up to me and told me how great and how sexy it was . They also told me I looked really healthy , but how wrong they were . I wasn 't healthy because I wasn 't eating properly and although I was slim at the time , that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet was always going to lead me to binge and put the weight back on " , and later , she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia .

 = Hurricane Arthur ( 2014 ) = 
 Hurricane Arthur was the earliest known hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. state of North Carolina . The first named storm of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season , Arthur developed from an initially non @-@ tropical area of low pressure over the Southeastern United States that emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean on June 28 . After sufficiently organizing , developing a well @-@ defined circulation and deep convection amid a favorable environment , it was classified a tropical depression on July 1 . The system continued to strengthen , and was declared a tropical storm later that day . Drifting northward , the storm reached hurricane status early on July 3 and curved toward the north @-@ northeast . Further structural organization resulted in additional intensification , and by 01 : 00 UTC on July 4 , the system attained its peak winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Arthur made landfall at 03 : 15 UTC over North Carolina 's Shackleford Banks , positioned between Cape Lookout and Beaufort , and intensified slightly further , with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 973 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 70 inHg ) . The storm then trekked swiftly northeast , weakening as it passed by Cape Cod and Nantucket , before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone and coming ashore at <unk> , Nova Scotia , on July 5 . The remnants continued generally northeastward through Atlantic Canada before ultimately dissipating on July 9 over the Labrador Sea . 
 Numerous tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for areas along the East Coast of the United States . A state of emergency was declared for 26 North Carolina counties , and both mandatory and voluntary evacuations were imposed along the state 's coast . Several hundred government personnel were deployed to assist in evacuation and preparation efforts , along with heavy equipment capable of removing sand and debris . Due to the hurricane 's timing , many Independence Day activities in the U.S. were cancelled or rescheduled . Damage was limited to strewn debris and inundated roads , and though 44 @,@ 000 power outages were reported and widespread flooding occurred along northern sections of the coast , no deaths or serious injuries were reported . In New England , Arthur brought flash flooding and caused additional power outages , resulting in widespread road closures and suspension of ferry service . Losses in the country amounted to US $ 3 @.@ 25 million . 
 In Atlantic Canada and Quebec , hurricane @-@ force gusts associated Arthur 's remnants produced widespread damage . Countless trees and power lines fell across the region , leaving more than 300 @,@ 000 without electricity . Damage to the power grid in Nova Scotia was regarded as the worst since Hurricane Juan in 2003 . Efforts to restore and repair infrastructure were prolonged , with thousands still without power 10 days after the storm . Efforts to restore and repair damage to the electrical grid cost C $ 8 @.@ 4 million ( US $ 7 @.@ 5 million ) . Reviews of Nova Scotia Power ( NSP ) and New Brunswick Power ( <unk> ) were called upon due to numerous complaints from customers and politicians alike . A communication breakdown between NSP and the public exacerbated problems , and Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil condemned the company 's response as " inexcusable . " Similarly severe impacts were felt by <unk> which suffered a record @-@ breaking C $ 23 million ( US $ 20 @.@ 1 million ) in damage from the storm . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On June 25 , 2014 , an area of showers and thunderstorms developed over the northern Gulf of Mexico ahead of a shortwave trough in Texas . That day , National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) began monitoring the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis off the Southeast United States over the following week as the system was expected to encounter favorable environmental conditions . An area of low @-@ level vorticity consolidated within the system on June 26 as it moved northeast across Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama . The following day it became intertwined with a frontal boundary over Georgia and South Carolina before emerging over the far western Atlantic Ocean early on June 28 . An area of low pressure soon formed within the system just off the coast of South Carolina . Generally favorable environmental conditions fostered further organization of the low , though convection remained minimal for several days . During the latter half of June 30 , a United States Air Force weather reconnaissance mission into the system confirmed the presence of a well @-@ organized circulation ; however , displacement of showers and thunderstorms from its center delayed its classification . Subsequent organization of convection into a banding feature along the system 's southern flank , as depicted by radar imagery , prompted the NHC to designate the low as Tropical Depression One at 00 : 00 UTC on July 1 . Situated 70 mi ( 110 km ) east @-@ southeast of Fort Pierce , Florida , the newly christened depression moved slowly westward within an area of weak steering currents . A turn northward was forecast as a mid @-@ level ridge built over the Atlantic . 
 Throughout July 1 , steady structural organization ensued . Around 15 : 00 UTC winds of 38 mph ( 61 km / h ) were measured at Settlement Point on Grand Bahama , prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to a tropical storm and assign it the name Arthur . Though environmental conditions surrounding the cyclone favored development , moderate wind shear and intrusions of dry air into the circulation prolonged organization . The effects of the shear showed clearly on WSR @-@ 88D radar imagery from Melbourne , Florida which depicted a mid @-@ level eye feature displaced 30 to 35 mi ( 48 to 56 km ) from the low @-@ level center . By July 2 , Arthur acquired a steady northward track as previously forecast . Throughout the day , convection consolidated around a developing eye as wind shear abated and the storm neared hurricane strength , with winds reaching 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . 
 Early on July 3 , data from hurricane hunters flying in the storm indicated that Arthur attained hurricane @-@ status about 190 mi ( 310 km ) south @-@ southwest of Cape Fear , North Carolina . At this time , the hurricane began turning slightly to the north @-@ northeast as it approached a weakness in the subtropical ridge ahead of a deep @-@ layer trough over the Eastern United States . Continued improvement of the storm 's convective structure fostered intensification as the storm neared the North Carolina coastline . At 00 : 00 UTC on July 4 , Arthur reached its peak winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , ranking it as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . It was the first hurricane to reach such strength since Hurricane Sandy in the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season . The storm featured a well @-@ defined 25 to 30 mi ( 40 to 48 km ) wide eye at this time . Thereafter , the hurricane made landfall at 03 : 15 UTC over the Shackleford Banks of North Carolina , located between Cape Lookout and Beaufort . Upon doing so , it became the earliest instance of a hurricane making landfall in the state during a calendar year , surpassing the previous record of July 11 set by an unnamed hurricane in 1901 . Slight deepening of the cyclone occurred as it moved over Pamlico Sound , with its barometric pressure bottoming out at 973 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 73 inHg ) . Continuing across Pamlico Sound , Arthur 's eye brushed the coastline of Dare County before striking the northern portion of the Outer Banks at 07 : 00 and 08 : 00 UTC , respectively . 
 After re @-@ emerging over the Atlantic Ocean on July 4 Arthur began to weaken . Though its eye remained well @-@ defined , winds aloft in the storm failed to effectively mix down to the surface . Traversing decreasing sea surface temperatures and amid increasing shear , Arthur began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day . Cloud tops associated with the system warmed and the structure became asymmetric . Reconnaissance continued to indicate strong flight @-@ level winds of 119 mph ( 192 km / h ) but surface winds at the time did not exceed 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Accelerating ahead of the trough over the East Coast , Arthur 's eye dissipated early on July 5 ; the storm passed within 75 mi ( 120 km ) of Chatham , Massachusetts around 03 : 00 UTC . Convection became increasingly displaced to the northeast as dry air entrained into the western portions of the circulation . Surface winds decreased below hurricane @-@ force by 06 : 00 UTC , and Arthur completed its conversion to an extratropical system at 12 : 00 UTC as it moved over the Bay of Fundy . The NHC subsequently issued its final advisory on the storm and shifted warning responsibility to the Canadian Hurricane Centre . 
 The remnants of Arthur re @-@ intensified somewhat as it traversed The Maritimes ; a sting jet with gusts of 65 – 80 mph ( 100 – 130 km / h ) developed along the storm 's backside . The former hurricane made an additional landfall in the region near Fundy National Park by 18 : 00 UTC . By July 6 , the sting jet had dissipated , and steady weakening of the cyclone resumed as only a split jet provided upper @-@ level support to the storm . Turning back to the northeast , Arthur moved through Labrador later that day . Once over the Labrador Sea , Arthur turned northwest while weakening before doubling back to the southeast . After weakening below gale @-@ force strength , the extratropical system dissipated late on July 9 . 
 Meteorologists noted to improved accuracy in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting models in predicting the intensity and track of Hurricane Arthur . 
 = = Warnings and watches = = 
 Multiple tropical cyclone warnings and watches were posted along the East Coast of the United States in advance of Arthur 's impacts in Florida , the Carolinas , New England , and Atlantic Canada . Upon developing into a tropical cyclone early on July 1 , a tropical storm watch was issued in Florida from Fort Pierce to Flagler Beach . At 09 : 00 UTC the next day , the tropical storm watch was discontinued south of Sebastian Inlet , while another one was posted from the Santee River in South Carolina to Bogue Banks in North Carolina . Additionally , a hurricane watch was issued for Oregon Inlet to the North Carolina – Virginia state line . Later on July 2 , a tropical storm warning became in effect from the North Carolina side of the Little River Inlet to the state line with Virginia . Simultaneously , the tropical storm watch in Florida was removed . 
 At 21 : 00 UTC on July 2 , a hurricane warning was posted in North Carolina from Surf City to Duck , including Albemarle and Pamlico sounds . Additionally , a tropical storm warning was issued from the Santee River to Surf City , while another one became in effect from Duck to Cape Charles Light in Virginia , including the mouth of Chesapeake Bay . A tropical storm warning was posted in Massachusetts at 21 : 00 UTC on July 3 , stretching from Provincetown to Chatham along Cape Cod including Nantucket , in addition to a tropical storm watch between Port Maitland and Point <unk> issued by Environment Canada . Around 01 : 00 UTC on July 4 , the hurricane watch was discontinued south of Surf City , while the tropical storm warning was discontinued south of Little River Inlet . Two hours later , the tropical storm warning was canceled south of Cape Fear , North Carolina , and tropical storm watches in Canada were expanded to encompass New Brunswick from the Canada – United States border to Grande Anse , Nova Scotia including Cape Breton Island , and Prince Edward Island . 
 The tropical storm warning from Surf City to Cape Fear was discontinued at 05 : 00 UTC on July 4 . A few hours later , the portion of the hurricane warning south of Bogue Inlet was removed . At 09 : 00 UTC on July 4 , the tropical storm warning in Massachusetts was extended westward to Woods Hole . Around that time , areas west of Cape Lookout in North Carolina were no longer under a hurricane warning . In North Carolina , the hurricane warning was canceled for areas south of Ocracoke Inlet at 11 : 00 UTC . All hurricane warnings in the state were discontinued four hours later , as was the tropical storm warning at Albemarle Sound ; in addition , all tropical storm watches issued by Environment Canada were then converted to tropical storm warnings . By 18 : 00 UTC on July 4 , the tropical storm warning on the east coast of Virginia , including the mouth of Chesapeake Bay , was discontinued . After passing by Nantucket and Cape Cod , the remaining tropical storm warnings in New England were rescinded . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Governor of North Carolina Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency for 25 counties in advance of the hurricane 's arrival . Fourteen shelters were opened , and the deteriorating North Carolina Highway 12 Bonner Bridge was closed as a precaution . Mandatory evacuations were declared for Hatteras Island and Richland Township in Beaufort County while voluntary evacuations were announced for Ocracoke Island , Aurora , Pamlico Beach , and Belhaven . Approximately 4 @,@ 300 individuals fled from Ocracoke Island via ferry despite only being under a voluntary evacuation , and while a mandatory evacuation had been encouraged by Hyde County 's emergency management director , other officials turned down the request . Tornado watches were issued for 10 North Carolina counties . In preparation for the possibility that Arthur 's storm surge would make North Carolina Highway 12 and Hatteras Island inaccessible , local officials deployed heavy equipment capable of removing sand and other debris . 
 To assist in storm preparations , 105 North Carolina National Guard members and 400 state highway patrol officers helped facilitate evacuations and storm preparations along the state 's coastline . Pamlico Sound ferry service was suspended , and various Independence Day activities rescheduled . Meanwhile , in Ocean City , Maryland , a celebratory fireworks event was postponed to July 5 , and in Boston , a Fourth of July Boston Pops concert and fireworks display were rescheduled to July 3 . Fireworks displays were also postponed throughout Rhode Island . National Weather Service and Coast Guard officials warned of the potential for rip currents along the East Coast resulting from Arthur . The National Park Service @-@ operated Wright Brothers National Memorial and Cape Lookout National Seashore were closed in anticipation of the storm . Several airlines waived change fees for travelers in areas affected by Arthur . Officials at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base sent more than 54 aircraft to Dayton , Ohio to prevent the occurrence of potential wind damage . In Nantucket , Massachusetts , a school was converted to a temporary shelter in anticipation of Arthur 's arrival . 
 In anticipation of Arthur 's arrival , Nova Scotia Power prepared and collected resources in case of power outages and other impacts in the region . Numerous weekend events were called off throughout the Canadian Maritimes , including the Stan Rogers Folk Festival . Multiple boat @-@ owners and fisherman took extra precautions by <unk> down hatches and tying extra lines to wharves to keep ships and boats from coming loose in the storm . Environment Canada officials issued high wind warnings in addition to earlier tropical storm warnings for the Maritimes and considered imposing rainfall warnings for western portions of Prince Edward Island as well . Province @-@ managed parks in Nova Scotia , including beaches and camping grounds , were shut down prior to Arthur 's arrival , and several airlines waived transfer fees . Officials in Moncton stated that city personnel would be prepared to respond to potential issues caused by Arthur , such as flooding or fallen trees , while the Canadian Red Cross readied volunteers in case of the need for emergency assistance . The Point <unk> Nuclear Generating Station took precautionary measures against the storm , with Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission employees deployed to the site .

 = = = Bahamas and Southeastern United States = = = 
 Between June 30 and July 1 , the outer bands of Arthur produced light rain over the northwestern Bahamas , with 1 @.@ 26 in ( 32 mm ) measured in Freeport . Winds at Settlement Point on Grand Bahama peaked at 47 mph ( 76 km / h ) with gusts to 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) . 
 Although Arthur remained offshore , large scale northerly flow from the west side of the cyclone sparked scattered severe thunderstorms across Florida for several days . Effects from these storms were generally minor with damage amounting to only $ 23 @,@ 000 . On July 3 however , one storm produced straight @-@ line winds estimated at 70 – 80 mph ( 110 – 130 km / h ) and caused two barns to collapse near Elkton . Additionally , rip currents affected Atlantic coastal areas of the state . In Daytona Beach , a dozen swimmers had to be rescued by lifeguards due to the strong currents generated by Arthur . Similar effects were felt in coastal Georgia with scattered thunderstorms causing minor damage . Farther north in South Carolina , Arthur produced wind gusts up to 42 mph ( 68 km / h ) along coastal areas , resulting in scattered power outages . Heavy rains also fell in and around Myrtle Beach , with a peak of 8 @.@ 73 in ( 222 mm ) measured just outside the city ; this was the highest total observed in relation to the storm throughout the country .

 Hurricane Arthur was the earliest recorded landfalling North Carolina hurricane , coming onshore at 03 : 15 UTC on July 4 . At Cape Lookout , a peak wind gust of 101 mph ( 163 km / h ) and 1 @-@ minute maximum sustained winds of 77 mph ( 124 km / h ) were recorded . A United States Coast Guard station in Cape Hatteras observed a peak gust of 91 mph ( 146 km / h ) . An EF1 tornado touched down in <unk> County , damaging two structures and many trees , while a funnel cloud was sighted within the vicinity of Elm City . Another EF1 tornado was reported in Martin County , which knocked a tree onto a house . The highest rainfall total measured as a result of Arthur in North Carolina , 4 @.@ 20 inches ( 107 mm ) , was recorded at Kinston . High tides were reported along the coast , with a peak storm surge of 4 @.@ 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) at Oregon Inlet . 
 Arthur caused power outages impacting at least 44 @,@ 000 customers , of which 16 @,@ 500 were in Carteret County ; another 1 @,@ 000 outages each occurred in Craven and New Hanover counties . As a result , Duke Energy deployed over 500 personnel to restore electrical service , while <unk> EMC handled more than 2 @,@ 000 outages in Pamlico , Hyde and Craven counties . Strong winds toppled trees and power poles in Hyde County and Ocracoke Island , and flooding occurred just south of downtown Wilmington , North Carolina . On other areas along the coast , flood waters reached 3 to 6 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 to 1 @.@ 83 m ) deep ; with widespread coastal erosion observed in many areas . Meanwhile , at Wrightsville Beach , the hurricane tore off shingles and partially defoliated palm trees , and in Manteo , 6 to 8 inches ( 150 to 200 mm ) of water inundated several businesses . Nearby , Kill Devil Hills experienced flooding to numerous residences and roads . Copious rainfall and strong winds were reported along the Outer Banks ; at least one additional county was added to the North Carolina 's state of emergency declaration , and while officials in Dare County initially intended to cut off access to the county while potential destruction was being surveyed , the curfew ended just after sunrise . Emergency officials announced the intention to begin damage assessments throughout the state as sunrise approached and Arthur departed the region . 
 After experiencing a " communication failure " with Ocracoke Island officials , a generator and communication equipment were delivered via ferry there . North Carolina Highway 12 , the only road linking Hatteras Island to the mainland , remained closed after Arthur 's passage , covered under water and sand . The repair cost for the road was less than $ 1 million . In Manteo , parts of U.S. Route 64 were shut down due to flooding , and northern portions of the North Carolina coastline also experienced significant flooding . Few flight cancellations were made necessary by Arthur 's approach along the East Coast , as the storm 's impacts were primarily offshore , and damage was limited to strewn debris and inundated roads . Overall , damage along the North Carolina shoreline was slight , and no fatalities or severe injuries were recorded . Throughout the county a total of 161 structures sustained damage , 16 of which had major damage , while none were destroyed . Damage in North Carolina amounted to $ 2 @.@ 34 million , almost entirely in Dare County alone . The low damage across the state was largely due to the storm 's fast motion .

 Owing to Arthur 's somewhat large size , strong winds and light rains impacted portions of the Delmarva Peninsula . In Virginia , sustained winds peaked at 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) at Rappahannock Light with gusts up to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . Tropical storm force winds were mostly confined to coastal areas of Delaware and Maryland . Maximum storm surge was 2 @.@ 38 ft ( 0 @.@ 73 m ) in Money Point , Virginia and 2 @.@ 34 ft ( 0 @.@ 71 m ) in Lewes , Delaware .

 Sustained winds of 49 mph ( 79 km / h ) and gusts to 63 mph ( 101 km / h ) were reported near Nantucket Island in Massachusetts as Arthur passed just offshore . Flooding was reported within the vicinity of Broad and Easy streets on Nantucket Island , and heavy rains induced widespread flooding elsewhere as well , with up to 8 @.@ 00 inches ( 203 mm ) of rain measured at New Bedford , 7 @.@ 20 inches ( 183 mm ) at Plymouth , and 6 @.@ 26 inches ( 159 mm ) at Fairhaven . The accumulation at New Bedford ranked Arthur as the ninth wettest tropical cyclone on record in the state . Massachusetts State Police shut down access to parts of Interstate 195 , Massachusetts Route 18 , and U.S. Route 6 as a precaution . Nearby in Fairhaven , Adams Street was inundated and inaccessible , while the heavy rainfall resulted in flash flooding at New Bedford ; as a result , a flash flood emergency was imposed by the National Weather Service . In addition , ferry service to and from Martha 's Vineyard and Nantucket was suspended . Minor flooding also led to road closures around Boston , including the Interstate 93 tunnel near Leverett Circle . The New Bedford Whaling Museum was also flooded , inundated under 20 inches ( 510 mm ) of water . Several boats were beached , and some flooding occurred at Cape Cod . NSTAR reported 8 @,@ 451 outages , 7 @,@ 500 of them on Cape Cod , while National Grid recorded 1 @,@ 900 , of which 1 @,@ 400 affected customers in Middlesex County . Moisture from Arthur also aided in the development of damaging thunderstorms across western Massachusetts . Total losses in the state amounted to $ 889 @,@ 000 . 
 In Maine , tropical storm @-@ force wind gusts downed numerous trees and power lines across eastern portions of the state . Winds on the mainland gusted to 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) while Machias Seal Island observed 71 mph ( 114 km / h ) . Outages in Maine affected 20 @,@ 000 – 25 @,@ 000 residences , primarily in Hancock and Washington counties . About 2 @,@ 800 Central Maine Power customers and 4 @,@ 390 Emera Maine patrons lost power , mostly due to overturned trees and branches throughout the state . Locally significant damage took place in Aroostook County where heavy rains enabled winds aloft to mix down to the surface . Alongside the winds heavy rainfall affected the state , with a maximum of 6 @.@ 48 inches ( 165 mm ) near Whiting .

 Powerful winds gusted up to 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) across much of Nova Scotia , with a confirmed peak value of 87 mph ( 140 km / h ) in Greenwood and an unconfirmed value of 112 mph ( 181 km / h ) in Sluice Point . Arthur knocked out power to more than 290 @,@ 000 individuals in the Maritimes ; 144 @,@ 000 of those were customers of Nova Scotia Power ( NSP ) , and 1 @,@ 500 of Maritime Electric on Prince Edward Island . In New Brunswick , power outages affected upwards of 140 @,@ 000 individuals , of which 52 @,@ 000 were situated near Fredericton , forcing the closure of the local University of New Brunswick campus . Copious rainfall was recorded in southwestern parts of New Brunswick , with 5 @.@ 91 in ( 150 mm ) measured at Gagetown . Flooding at Saint John , New Brunswick made two local streets inaccessible , while winds downed electrical poles in Fredericton . In Onslow , Nova Scotia , firefighters rescued a man trapped under a tree limb , while a sailboat capsized at Charlottetown harbor and another was washed out to sea . The hurricane forced temporary suspension of the MV Nova Star ferry service between Yarmouth , Nova Scotia and Portland , Maine . The storm caused flight delays and cancellations at Halifax Stanfield International Airport , while <unk> and <unk> Island ferries were shut down ; in addition , access to the A. Murray MacKay Bridge was restricted to smaller vehicles . In Stratford , Prince Edward Island , a woman died after being struck by a door that was caught by a gust of wind , and in Woodstock , New Brunswick , a man died when his oxygen support was cut off during a power outage . In some parts of Nova Scotia , damage to the electrical grid was reported to be the worst since Hurricane Juan in 2003 . Damage throughout New Brunswick amounted to at least C $ 12 @.@ 6 million ( US $ 11 million ) . 
 Effects from Arthur extended as far away as Quebec , where topographic wind enhancement occurred .

 Power outages across Nova Scotia lasted for a week after the storm 's passage . This prompted numerous complaints from residents and officials , both criticizing NSP for their slow response . On July 9 , NSP President and CEO Bob <unk> issued a public apology for the communication breakdown between his company and customers . By July 11 , 2 @,@ 400 customers remained without electricity with 187 crews working to restore it . The delay in restoration prompted numerous complaints from residents and Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil condemned NSP 's response as " inexcusable . " McNeil ordered a review of the company to be made by provincial regulators . He and Energy Minister Andrew Younger agreed that there was a total failure of communication , namely through their website , between NSP and residents . One resident in Annapolis Valley stated that the company continuously told her power would be restored soon , when it ultimately took five days for it to return . NSP stated that in the four years prior to Arthur , C $ 70 million had been spent on improving the electrical infrastructure ; however , the storm was of a severity beyond any other since Hurricane Juan . 
 Similar issues occurred in New Brunswick where 18 @,@ 000 customers remained without power through July 11 . More than 310 crews remained deployed throughout the province with electricity expected to be fully restored by the following week . Costs to repair the power grid were estimated in excess of C $ 12 million ( US $ 11 @.@ 1 million ) . There was criticism that New Brunswick Power did not appropriately prepare for the storm and actually requested assistance from other public power companies and private contractors after the storm had struck . Two public buildings in Fredericton were utilized as recharging centers for residents to charge their phones and shower . An estimated 6 @,@ 000 people took advantage of this through July 10 . Shaved ice was later distributed from the Grant @-@ Harvey Centre in the city while several waste disposal sites were opened for residents to get rid of spoiled food from power outages . Gaëtan Thomas , president and chief executive officer of NB Power , likened the effects of Arthur in the region to Hurricane Katrina along the United States Gulf Coast in August 2005 . He referenced that during Katrina , 50 percent of the affected region lost power , while in the wake of Arthur 57 percent of New Brunswick was in the dark over a similar geographic area . Earlier cuts to the company 's tree @-@ trimming budget were cited as a possible cause in the scale of damage . As such , their budget for trimming in 2015 was increased from C $ 6 million to C $ 8 million . 
 Emergency management officials in Fredericton stated that it could be years before the city fully recovered from the storm . Power restoration in the province reached over 99 percent on July 16 with only 750 customers still out . However , a thunderstorm that evening revealed the weak nature of the power grid as outages jumped back over 4 @,@ 000 . The following week , Energy Minister Craig Leonard rebutted claims that a public review of NB Power was necessary , despite the longevity and severity of the power outages . New Brunswick 's Liberal and Green parties both supported an independent review of the company , while Leonard claimed only an internal review was necessary . The total cost to restore and repair damage to the power grid wrought by the storm amounted to C $ 8 @.@ 4 million ( US $ 7 @.@ 5 million ) . This ranked it as the second @-@ costliest event for Nova Scotia Power from a tropical cyclone , only behind Hurricane Juan . New Brunswick Power reported even greater losses from Arthur with damage amounting to C $ 23 million ( US $ 20 @.@ 1 million ) . This marked the costliest disaster in the company 's history , surpassing the December 2013 ice storm . In light of the severe damage , NB Power allocated an extra C $ 5 @.@ 1 million ( US $ 4 @.@ 5 million ) for tree trimming during the 2014 @-@ 2014 fiscal year . 
 By July 9 , 11 municipalities across Quebec were declared disaster areas and made eligible for federal funding . Ten more municipalities were placed under this declaration on July 11 following further damage assessments . The Canadian Red Cross provided residents in <unk> with food and aid . Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard allocated C $ 100 @,@ 000 in aid for the affected areas and promised further funding . 
 A few weeks after the storm , a severe outbreak of fire blight , a bacterial infection , occurred in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia , affecting as many as 80 percent of the Valley 's apple orchards . The storm was blamed for causing microscopic cracks in leaves , which allowed airborne bacteria to enter the plants . 
 = German cruiser Seydlitz = 
 Seydlitz was a heavy cruiser of Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine , fourth in the Admiral Hipper class , but was never completed . The ship was laid down in December 1936 and launched in January 1939 , but the outbreak of World War II slowed her construction and fitting @-@ out work was finally stopped in the summer of 1940 when she was approximately 95 percent complete . The unfinished ship remained pier @-@ side in the shipyard until March 1942 , when the Kriegsmarine decided to pursue aircraft carriers over surface combatants . Seydlitz was among the vessels chosen for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers . 
 Renamed Weser , the ship was to have had a complement of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 divebombers . Work was not completed , however , and the incomplete vessel was towed to Königsberg where she was eventually scuttled . The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sistership Lützow for the Soviet Navy . This plan was also abandoned , and the ship was broken up for scrap . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Seydlitz was ordered by the Kriegsmarine from the Deschimag shipyard in Bremen . Seydlitz was originally designed as a light cruiser version of the Admiral Hipper class heavy cruisers , armed with twelve 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns instead of the Admiral Hipper 's eight 20 @.@ 3 cm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) guns . The Kriegsmarine decided , however , to complete the ship identically to Admiral Hipper on 14 November 1936 . Her keel was laid on 29 December 1936 , under construction number 940 . The ship was launched on 19 January 1939 , but after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , work was halted when the ship was approximately 95 percent complete . 
 Seydlitz was 210 meters ( 690 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 21 @.@ 80 m ( 71 @.@ 5 ft ) and a maximum draft of 7 @.@ 90 m ( 25 @.@ 9 ft ) . The ship had a design displacement of 17 @,@ 600 t ( 17 @,@ 300 long tons ; 19 @,@ 400 short tons ) and a full load displacement of 19 @,@ 800 long tons ( 20 @,@ 100 t ) . Seydlitz was powered by three sets of geared steam turbines , which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra @-@ high pressure oil @-@ fired boilers . The ship 's top speed was 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , at 132 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 98 @,@ 000 kW ) . As designed , her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1 @,@ 340 enlisted men . 
 Seydlitz 's primary armament was eight 20 @.@ 3 cm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) SK L / 60 guns mounted in four twin gun turrets , placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft . Her anti @-@ aircraft battery consisted of twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L / 65 guns , twelve 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and eight 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns . The ship also carried a pair of triple 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo launchers abreast of the rear superstructure . The ship was equipped with three Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult . Seydlitz 's armored belt was 70 to 80 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick ; her upper deck was 12 to 30 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 to 1 @.@ 18 in ) thick while the main armored deck was 20 to 50 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 to 1 @.@ 97 in ) thick . The main battery turrets had 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) thick faces and 70 mm thick sides . 
 = = Conversion = = 
 Following the loss of the battleship Bismarck in May 1941 , during which British aircraft carriers proved instrumental , and the near torpedoing of her sistership Tirpitz in March 1942 , the Kriegsmarine became convinced of the necessity of acquiring aircraft carriers . Work on the purpose @-@ built carrier Graf Zeppelin , which had been halted in April 1940 , was resumed in March 1942 . The Kriegsmarine also decided to convert a number of vessels into auxiliary aircraft carriers . Seydlitz was among the ships selected for conversion , along with several passenger liners . 
 At the same time as construction of Graf Zeppelin resumed , conversion work began on Seydlitz . The majority of the superstructure was cut away , with the exception of the funnel , to prepare for the installation of a flight deck and an aircraft hangar . In total , approximately 2 @,@ 400 t ( 2 @,@ 400 long tons ; 2 @,@ 600 short tons ) of material from the ship was removed . The flight deck was to have been 200 m ( 660 ft ) long and 30 m ( 98 ft ) wide . The hangar was 137 @.@ 50 m ( 451 @.@ 1 ft ) long and 17 m ( 56 ft ) wide forward and 12 m ( 39 ft ) wide amidships and aft . Her armament was reduced to an anti @-@ aircraft battery of ten 10 @.@ 5 cm L / 65 guns in twin mounts , two forward of the conning tower and three aft , ten 3 @.@ 7 cm guns in dual mounts , and twenty @-@ four 2 cm guns in quadruple mounts . 
 Seydlitz 's air complement was to have consisted of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 Stuka divebombers . The Bf 109 fighters were a navalized version of the " E " model , designated as Bf 109T . Their wings were longer than the land @-@ based model to allow for shorter take @-@ off . The Ju 87s were to have been the " E " variant , which was a navalized version of the Ju 87D , and were modified for catapult launches and were equipped with arresting gear . 
 The ship was renamed Weser , but work was ceased in June 1943 , before the conversion was completed . The unfinished vessel was then transferred to Königsberg , where she remained for the rest of the war . On 29 January 1945 , the ship was scuttled before the advancing Soviet Red Army could seize her . The Soviet Navy nevertheless considered using the wreck for parts to complete the cruiser Lützow , a sister @-@ ship of Seydlitz the Soviets had purchased unfinished before the outbreak of war . This was not carried out , however , and the ship was broken up for scrap .

 " Picture to Burn " was inspired by her high school boyfriend , now firefighter , Jordan Alford with whom Swift did not establish a formal romantic relationship . She was his classmate at Hendersonville High School in Tennessee and they went out before he dated classmate Chelsea who would later become his wife . " ' They dated in freshman year , but then after that , girl code , once you date an ex @-@ boyfriend you 're not friends anymore . Picture To Burn is about him . Because he 's always had big old trucks and stuff , ' Taylor Swift said . She was frequently frustrated by his narcissistic and cocky nature , and decided to write a song about how she felt at her after school job , writing songs for Sony / ATV Music . It was co @-@ written with Liz Rose on guitar , and given a comedic edge ( an idea of Swift 's ) . Swift found herself sitting , playing her guitar , and saying , " I hate his stupid truck that he doesn 't let me drive . He 's such a redneck ! Oh my God ! ' , a line that was ultimately developed into the song 's chorus . Swift described it as brutally honest , and cited it as an example of how she expresses herself if someone leaves her heartbroken , offends her , or is hostile towards her .

Swift recalled that , although " Tim McGraw " ( 2006 ) was her only single at the time she began opening for Rascal Flatts ' Me and My Gang Tour ( 2006 – 07 ) , " Picture to Burn " was the performance in which the crowd seemed to be the most enthusiastic with most screaming it " at the top of their lungs " . 
 In retrospect , Swift has stated that the song was something typical of her to say in her teenage years and that it exemplified how she processed emotion at the time , adding " I didn 't know anything then . " She explained , " I had this song called ' Picture to Burn , ' that 's talking about how ' I hate your truck , ' and ' I hate that you ignored me , ' ' I hate you . ' Now , the way that I would say that and the way that I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different . " Despite her evolving on a personal level and as a songwriter , she claimed not to be regretful of " Picture to Burn " , rather happy she was able to demonstrate " those emotions that when you 're so angry , you hate everything . It 's like recording your diary over the years , and that 's a gift " , she said .

 = = Music video = = 
 The accompanying music video for " Picture to Burn " was directed by Trey Fanjoy , who directed all three of Swift 's prior music videos . Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again because she felt that since Fanjoy directed her prior videos , she knew how to deviate from it and what new grounds to cover . As opposed to their previous collaborations , the video was conceptualized to be edgy and comical . Swift herself was styled edgier than usual , sporting clothing , hair , and jewelry she was not accustomed to . She was intended to wear thigh @-@ length boots , but was not able to find a pair to correspond with her height . Instead , her stylist sewed black fabric to strap onto black high heels to give the illusion of thigh @-@ length boots . The video 's plot was conjectured to involve rampaging and seeking revenge on her ex @-@ boyfriend . Swift chose football player Justin Sandy to portray her ex @-@ boyfriend in the video , believing he had a classic and suspiciously perfect demeanor ; she described him as " real like Ken " . Swift desired to portray her backup band 's sense of humor , and thus enlisted them for the video . Swift 's real @-@ life best friend Abigail Anderson also made a cameo appearance in the video . 
 The video was filmed over the course of two days in Nashville , Tennessee . On the first day , performance scenes were filmed inside the Sommet Center ( now named the Bridgestone Arena ) , and involved pyrotechnics . Swift was at first nervous about the shoot , as it was her first experience with pyrotechnics . " There are some things I 'm nervous about . My hair could very well catch on fire " , she said . She was later assured of its safety and explained to about the discrepancy in the distance of the fire in reality than on camera : on camera , it appears to be quite close to her , whereas , in actuality , it was placed far behind her . On the second day , the remaining scenes were filmed at a suburban house in Nashville . Props were provided by the video personnel . On the set , Fanjoy suggested using a binoculars for the primary scenes , but Swift disagreed , believing it could come across as cheesy depending on how it was filmed . She ultimately succumbed to the idea due to Fanjoy explaining how it would translate on camera . 
 The video premiered on March 14 , 2008 on AOL 's The Boot . It commences with Swift and her best friend in a grey 2009 Ford Mustang GT 45th Anniversary Edition , parked behind a tree . Swift reminiscences , looking at a photograph of her and her ex @-@ boyfriend together , and states , " Would you look at how happy we were back then ? I can 't believe he turned out to be such a jerk . " Anderson is then seen ogling outside the window with binoculars , and spots Swift 's ex @-@ boyfriend and another woman arriving in a black late 90s ford <unk> pick @-@ up truck . She notes the other woman in driving the truck , and Swift states angrily he never allowed her to drive it . As Swift 's ex @-@ boyfriend and the woman start frolicking inside the truck , and the music begins and the music video transcends to a concrete room where the singer ( clothed by a grey , one @-@ shoulder mini @-@ dress and black leather , thigh @-@ length boots ) is playing an electric guitar , alongside her backup band . During " Picture to Burn " ' s chorus , fire ignites behind them . Afterwards , the band is depicted entering a house furtively , using flashlights . Swift is sitting on a brown couch , sporting a black tank top , black leather pants , and beehive hair , as the band ransacks the house . They throw darts at photographs of him , envelop all of his furniture with toilet paper , mess his mirror with the word " loser " , lick his utensils and spit into his mouthwash . Suddenly , the ex @-@ boyfriend and the woman are shown approaching the house , and , seeing this , Anderson informs them of it via handheld transceiver . He enters the house and discovers it was ransacked , and repeats the word " Taylor " . The video then transitions to Anderson and Swift inside the Ford Mustang , with Anderson also repeating " Taylor " . She then suggests leaving , and Swift says , " You know what ? I 'm over it . " The video concludes with the photograph of Swift and her ex @-@ boyfriend in flames , thrown in the sidewalk . Cut @-@ scenes feature Swift and her band performing in the concrete room , Swift singing on the couch , or Swift dancing affront a shower of sparks .

 = Russian cruiser Bayan ( 1907 ) = 
 Bayan ( Russian : <unk> ) was the third of the four Bayan @-@ class armoured cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the early 1900s . The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet . She was modified to lay mines shortly after World War I began . Bayan laid mines herself and provided cover for other ships laying minefields . The ship fought several inconclusive battles with German ships during the war , including the Battle of Åland Islands in mid @-@ 1915 . She also participated in the Battle of Moon Sound during the German invasion of the Estonian islands in late 1917 , where she was damaged . Bayan was decommissioned in 1918 and sold for scrap in 1922 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Bayan was 449 @.@ 6 feet ( 137 @.@ 0 m ) long overall . She had a maximum beam of 57 @.@ 5 feet ( 17 @.@ 5 m ) , a draught of 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) and displaced 7 @,@ 750 long tons ( 7 @,@ 870 t ) . The ship had a crew of 568 officers and men . Bayan was named in honor of the earlier Russian cruiser captured by the Japanese during the Russo @-@ Japanese War . Both ships were named for the legendary bard , Boyan . 
 The ship had two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines with a designed total of 16 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 304 kW ) , but they developed 19 @,@ 320 indicated horsepower ( 14 @,@ 410 kW ) on sea trials and drove the ship to a maximum speed of 22 @.@ 55 knots ( 41 @.@ 76 km / h ; 25 @.@ 95 mph ) . Steam for the engines was provided by 26 Belleville boilers . She could carry a maximum of 1 @,@ 100 long tons ( 1 @,@ 118 t ) of coal , although her range is unknown . 
 Bayan 's main armament consisted of two 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) 45 @-@ calibre guns in single turrets fore and aft . Her eight 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns were mounted in casemates on the sides of the ship 's hull . Anti @-@ torpedo boat defense was provided by twenty @-@ two 75 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) 50 @-@ calibre guns ; eight of these were mounted in casemates on the side of the hull and in the superstructure . Two guns were astern , in the admiral 's apartments , and the remaining twelve guns were located on upper deck amidships ( eight above the six @-@ inch gun casemates ) , in pivot mounts with gun shields . The ship also had two submerged 450 @-@ millimetre ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , one mounted on each broadside . 
 In early 1916 , eight of the ship 's 75 mm guns in the central casemate were removed , and in early 1917 , the rest were removed as well . By early 1917 , an additional eight @-@ inch gun was fitted on the centreline forward of the mainmast ( it was supposed to be protected with a gun shield , but the photos do not confirm this ) . In addition , four more six @-@ inch guns were added on an upper deck , two on each broadside . In early 1917 , Bayan was also fitted with two anti @-@ aircraft 76 mm Lender guns , mounted to the sides of the after turret . 
 The ship used Krupp armour throughout . Her waterline belt was 175 millimetres ( 6 @.@ 9 in ) thick over her machinery spaces , reducing to 90 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) towards lower edge . Fore and aft , it reduced to 100 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . The upper belt and the casemates were 60 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick . The armour deck was 50 millimetres ( 2 in ) thick ; over the central battery it was a single plate , but elsewhere it consisted of a 30 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) plate over two 10 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) plates . The gun turrets were protected by 132 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 2 in ) of armour and the conning tower had walls 136 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) thick .

 Bayan was built by the Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg . Construction began on 15 August 1905 , although she was ceremonially laid down only on the day of her launching 15 August 1907 . Bayan was completed in early 1911 and commissioned on 14 July 1911 . She spent her entire career with the Baltic Fleet . 
 When World War I began , Bayan was assigned to the First Cruiser Brigade . Shortly after the start of the war , in December 1914 Bayan was modified to carry up to 110 mines . She laid her first mines in early December when she was one of a group of ships that mined the northern and western entrances to the Gulf of Danzig . The following month , she provided cover as other cruisers laid minefields in the western Baltic Sea , near Bornholm and Rügen Islands on the night of 12 January 1915 . Together with her sister Admiral Makarov and two protected cruisers , she fought a brief and inconclusive action with the light cruiser SMS München during the night of 6 / 7 May while covering a minelaying sortie off Libau . 
 On 2 July , the ship participated in the Battle of Åland Islands when intercepted and decoded wireless signals informed the Russians that a small German force was at sea to lay a minefield off the Åland Islands . Rear Admiral Mikhail Bakhirev was already at sea with Admiral Makarov , Bayan , Rurik , the protected cruisers Bogatyr and Oleg , and the destroyer Novik en route to bombard Memel . Rurik and Novik got separated from the others in fog , but the rest of the force encountered the light cruiser SMS Augsburg and a number of destroyers escorting the minelayer SMS Albatross . The Russians concentrated on Albatross , which was forced to run aground in Swedish territorial waters , while the faster Augsburg escaped to the south . The Russian cruisers were low on ammunition when they encountered two more German cruisers and broke off the action after Bayan and the armoured cruiser SMS Roon exchanged hits . Bayan fired 40 eight @-@ inch rounds and was hit with one 210 mm round amidships , which caused superficial damage and wounds to two crewmen . Roon lost her wireless aerial due to a near miss ; the Russians reported more hits , but not confirmed . 
 = = = Battle of Moon Sound = = = 
 In 1917 , Bayan was the flagship of Vice Admiral Bakhirev , who now commanded the naval forces defending the Gulf of Riga . During Operation Albion , the invasion of the Estonian islands of Saaremaa ( Ösel ) , Hiiumaa ( Dagö ) and Muhu ( Moon ) , in October 1917 , the ship defended the southern entrance to Moon Sound on 17 October . When the German minesweepers began clearing the minefields guarding the entrance , they were attacked by Bayan and the predreadnought Grazhdanin , while the predreadnought Slava engaged the dreadnoughts König and Kronprinz defending the minesweepers . Slava was hit multiple times by the German ships and <unk> ordered his forces to withdraw . Bayan was the last ship to withdraw , but she was hit once by a 30 @.@ 5 @-@ centimetre ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) shell from König before she moved out of range . The shell penetrated the deck near the forward turret and started a fire among the flammable material in the cable compartment that was not extinguished until the next day . Fragments from the shell destroyed a bulkhead and loosened some plates of the ship 's bottom . The location of the fire near the forward magazine forced it to be flooded as a precaution . Between the leaky plates and the flooded magazine , the ship took about 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 000 t ) aboard and her draught forward increased to 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) . The shell killed five men and wounded three more . Despite her increased draught , Bayan was able to pass through the dredged channel connecting the northern and southern parts of Moon Sound later that day . When the general withdrawal was ordered the following day , the ship sailed for Finland . 
 She was paid off in 1918 and did not participate in the Russian Civil War . Bayan was sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up in Stettin .

 Burger King , often abbreviated as BK , is an American global chain of hamburger fast food restaurants headquartered in unincorporated Miami @-@ Dade County , Florida , United States . The company began in 1953 as Insta @-@ Burger King , a Jacksonville , Florida @-@ based restaurant chain . After Insta @-@ Burger King ran into financial difficulties in 1954 , its two Miami @-@ based franchisees , David Edgerton and James McLamore , purchased the company and renamed it Burger King . Over the next half century , the company would change hands four times , with its third set of owners , a partnership of TPG Capital , Bain Capital , and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners , taking it public in 2002 . In late 2010 , 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in BK in a deal valued at US $ 3 @.@ 26 billion . The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes . 3G , along with partner Berkshire Hathaway , eventually merged the company with Canadian @-@ based doughnut chain Tim Hortons under the auspices of a new Canadian @-@ based parent company , Restaurant Brands International . 
 At the end of fiscal year 2015 , Burger King reported it had over 15 @,@ 000 outlets in 100 countries ; of these , 47 @.@ 5 % are in the United States and 99 @.@ 5 % are privately owned and operated with its new owners moving to an almost entirely franchised model in 2013 . BK has historically used several variations of franchising to expand its operations . The manner in which the company licenses its franchisees varies depending on the region , with some regional franchises , known as master franchises , responsible for selling franchise sub @-@ licenses on the company 's behalf . Burger King 's relationship with its franchises has not always been harmonious . Occasional spats between the two have caused numerous issues , and in several instances the company 's and its licensees ' relations have degenerated into precedent @-@ setting court cases . Burger King 's Australian franchise , Hungry Jack 's , is the only franchise to operate under a different name due to a trademark dispute and a series of legal cases between the two . 
 The Burger King menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers , French fries , sodas , and milkshakes in 1954 , to a larger , more diverse set of product offerings . In 1957 , the Whopper was the first major addition to the menu ; it has since become Burger King 's signature product . Conversely , BK has introduced many products which failed to catch hold in the marketplace . Some of these failures in the United States have seen success in foreign markets , where BK has also tailored its menu for regional tastes . From 2002 to 2010 , Burger King aggressively targeted the 18 – 34 male demographic with larger products that often carried correspondingly large amounts of unhealthy fats and trans @-@ fats . This tactic would eventually come to hurt the company 's financial underpinnings and cast a negative pall on its earnings . Beginning in 2011 , the company began to move away from the previous male @-@ oriented menu and introduce new menu items , product reformulations , and packaging as part of 3G Capital 's restructuring plans of the company . 
 The 1970s were the " Golden Age " of Burger King advertising , but beginning in the early 1980s , the company 's advertising began to lose focus ; a series of less successful ad campaigns created by a procession of advertising agencies continued for the next two decades . In 2003 , Burger King hired the Miami @-@ based advertising agency of Crispin Porter + Bogusky ( CP + B ) . CP + B completely reorganized Burger King 's advertising with a series of new campaigns centered on a redesigned Burger King character accompanied with a new online presence . While highly successful , some of CP + B commercials were derided for perceived sexism or cultural insensitivity . New owner , 3G Capital , terminated the relationship with CP + B in 2011 and moved its advertising to McGarryBowen to begin a new product oriented campaign with expanded demographic targeting . 
 = = History = = 
 The predecessor to Burger King was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville , Florida , as Insta @-@ Burger King . After visiting the McDonald brothers ' original store location in San Bernardino , California , the founders and owners ( Keith J. Kramer and his wife 's uncle Matthew Burns ) , who had purchased the rights to two pieces of equipment called " Insta " machines , opened their first restaurants . Their production model was based on one of the machines they had acquired , an oven called the " Insta @-@ Broiler " . This strategy proved so successful that they later required all of their franchises to use the device . After the company faltered in 1959 , it was purchased by its Miami , Florida franchisees , James McLamore and David R. Edgerton . They initiated a corporate restructuring of the chain , first renaming the company Burger King . They ran the company as an independent entity for eight years ( eventually expanding to over 250 locations in the United States ) , before selling it to the Pillsbury Company in 1967 . 
 Pillsbury management tried several times to restructure Burger King in the late 1970s and early 1980s . The most prominent change came in 1978 , when Burger King hired McDonald 's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company . In a plan called Operation Phoenix , Smith restructured corporate business practices at all levels of the company . Changes included updated franchise agreements , a broader menu , and new , standardized restaurant designs . Smith left Burger King for PepsiCo in 1980 , shortly before a system @-@ wide decline in sales . Pillsbury Executive Vice President of Restaurant Operations Norman E. Brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival , McDonald 's . One of his initiatives was a new advertising campaign featuring a series of attack ads against its major competitors . This campaign started a competitive period between the top burger chains , known as the Burger Wars . Brinker left Burger King in 1984 , to take over Dallas @-@ based gourmet burger chain Chili 's . 
 Smith and Brinker 's efforts were initially effective , but , after their respective departures , Pillsbury relaxed or discarded many of their changes and scaled back on construction of new locations . These actions stalled corporate growth and sales declined again , eventually resulting in a damaging fiscal slump for Burger King and Pillsbury . Poor operation and ineffectual leadership continued to bog down the company for many years . Pillsbury was acquired by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan in 1989 . 
 Initially , Grand Met attempted to bring the chain top profitability under newly minted CEO Barry Gibbons , the changes he initiated during his two @-@ year tenure were hit or miss . Successful new product introductions and product tie @-@ ins with the Walt Disney company were offset by continuing image problems and ineffectual advertising programs . Additionally , Gibbons sold off several of the company 's assets in attempt to profit from their sale and terminated many staff members . After Gibbon 's departure , a series of CEO each tried to repair the brand by changing the menu , bringing in new ad agencies and other changes . 
 The parental disregard of the Burger King brand continued through Grand Metropolitan 's merger with Guinness in 1997 , when the two organizations formed the new holding company Diageo . Eventually , the ongoing , systematic institutional neglect of the brand through the string of owners damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased . Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the money @-@ losing chain and put the company up for sale in 2000 . 
 The twenty @-@ first century saw the company return to independence when it was purchased from Diageo by a group of investment firms led by TPG Capital for US $ 1 @.@ 5 billion in 2002 . The new owners rapidly moved to revitalize and reorganize the company , culminating with the company being taken public in 2006 with a highly successful initial public offering . The firms ' strategy for turning the chain around included a new advertising agency and new ad campaigns , a revamped menu strategy , a series of programs designed to revamp individual stores , a new restaurant concept called the BK Whopper Bar , and a new design format called 20 / 20 . These changes successfully re @-@ energized the company , leading to a score of profitable quarters . Yet , despite the successes of the new owners , the effects of the financial crisis of 2007 – 2010 weakened the company 's financial outlooks while those of its immediate competitor McDonald 's grew . The falling value of Burger King eventually led to TPG and its partners divesting their interest in the chain in a US $ 3 @.@ 26 billion sale to 3G Capital of Brazil . Analysts from financial firms UBS and Stifel Nicolaus agreed that 3G would have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes . After the deal was completed , the company 's stock was removed from the New York Stock Exchange , ending a four @-@ year period as a public company . The delisting of its stock was designed to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald 's without having to worry about pleasing shareholders . In the United States domestic market , the chain has fallen to third place in terms of same store sales behind Ohio @-@ based Wendy 's . The decline is the result of 11 consecutive quarters of same store sales decline . 
 In August 2014 , 3G announced that it planned to acquire the Canadian restaurant and coffee shop chain Tim Hortons and merge it with Burger King with backing from Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway . The two chains will retain separate operations post @-@ merger , with Burger King remaining in its Miami headquarters . A Tim Hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King 's resources for international growth . The combined company will be the third @-@ largest international chain of fast food restaurants . The deal lead to a controversy over the practice of tax inversions , in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a tax haven , a country with lower rates but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location . As a high @-@ profile instance of tax inversion , news of the merger was criticized by U.S. politicians , who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests , and could result in further government pressure against inversions .

 Burger King Holdings is the parent company of Burger King , also known as Burger King Corporation and abbreviated BKC , and is a Delaware corporation formed on 23 July 2002 . A subsidiary , it derives its income from several sources , including property rental and sales through company owned restaurants ; however a substantial portion of its revenue is dependent on franchise fees . During the transitional period after the acquisition of the company by 3G Capital , Burger King 's board of directors was co @-@ chaired by John W. Chidsey , formerly CEO and chairman of the company , and Alex Behring , managing partner of 3G Capital . By April 2011 the new ownership completed the restructuring of Burger King 's corporate management and Chidsey tendered his resignation , leaving Behring as CEO and chair . 
 The company operates approximately 40 subsidiaries globally that oversee franchise operations , acquisitions and financial obligations such as pensions . One example of a subsidiary is Burger King Brands , Inc. which is responsible for the management of Burger King 's intellectual properties . A wholly owned subsidiary established in 1990 , Burger King Brands owns and manages all trademarks , copyrights and domain names used by the restaurants in the United States and Canada . It also responsible for providing marketing and related services to the parent company . 
 The majority of Burger King restaurants , approximately 90 % , are privately held franchises . In North America Burger King Corporation is responsible for licensing operators and administering of stores . Internationally the company often pairs with other parties to operate locations or it will outright sell the operational and administrative rights to a franchisee which is given the designation of master franchise for the territory . The master franchise will then be expected to sub @-@ license new stores , provide training support and ensure operational standards are maintained . In exchange for the oversight responsibilities , the master franchise will receive administrative and advertising support from Burger King Corporation to ensure a common marketing scheme . The 3G Capital ownership group announced in April 2011 that it would begin divesting itself of many corporate owned locations with the intent to increase the number of privately held restaurants to 95 % . 
 As the franchisor for the brand , Burger King Holdings has several obligations and responsibilities ; the company designs and deploys corporate training systems while overseeing brand standards such as building design and appearance . The company also develops new products and deploys them after presenting them to its franchises for approval per a 2010 agreement between itself and the franchise ownership groups . Burger King has limited approval over franchise operations such as minimum hours of operation and promotional pricing . Additionally Burger King designates approved vendors and distributors while ensuring safety standards at the productions facilities of its vendors . 
 Burger King is headquartered in a nine @-@ story office tower by the Miami International Airport in unincorporated Miami @-@ Dade County , Florida . Elaine Walker of the Miami Herald stated that the headquarters has a " Burger King " sign that drivers on State Road 836 " can 't miss . " In addition , the chain planned to build a neon sign on the roof to advertise the brand to passengers landing at the airport . On Monday 8 July 2002 , 130 employees began working at the Burger King headquarters with the remainder moving in phases in August 2002 . Prior to the moving to its current headquarters in 2002 , Burger King had considered moving away from the Miami area ; Miami @-@ Dade County politicians and leaders lobbied against this , and Burger King stayed . In August 2014 the future of the company 's Miami headquarters was again in doubt as reports surfaced Burger King was in talks with Tim Hortons about buying the Canadian restaurant chain , with a view to relocating its headquarters to Canada where the corporate tax rate is lower . 
 The company 's previous headquarters were in a southern Dade County campus described by Walker as " sprawling " and " virtually hidden away . " The former headquarters were located on Old Cutler Blvd in the Cutler census @-@ designated place . The former Burger King headquarters as of 2007 houses rental offices for several companies . 
 = = Franchises = = 
 When Burger King Corporation began franchising in 1959 , it used a regional model where franchisees purchased the right to open stores within a geographic region . These franchise agreements granted BKC very little oversight control of its franchisees and resulted in issues of product quality control , store image and design , and operational procedures . 
 During the 1970s , structural deficiencies in Burger King 's franchise system became increasingly problematic for Pillsbury . A major example was the relationship between Burger King and Louisiana @-@ based franchisee Chart House , Burger King 's largest franchisee group at the time with over 350 locations in the United States . The company 's owners , William and James Trotter , made several moves to take over or acquire Burger King during the 1970s , all of which were spurned by Pillsbury . After the failed attempts to acquire the company , the relationship between Chart House and Burger King soured and eventually devolved into a lawsuit . Chart House eventually spun off its Burger King operations in the early 1980s into a holding company called DiversiFoods , which in turn was acquired by Pillsbury in 1984 and absorbed into Burger King 's operations . 
 As part of the franchising reorganization segment of Operation Phoenix , Donald N. Smith initiated a restructuring of future franchising agreements in 1978 . Under this new franchise agreement , new owners were disallowed from living more than one hour from their restaurants – restricting them to smaller individuals or ownership groups and preventing large , multi @-@ state corporations from owning franchises . Franchisee were also now prohibited from operating other chains , preventing them from diverting funds away from their Burger King holdings . This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King Corporation as Chart House had . Smith also sought to have BKC be the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises . This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies . By 1988 , parent company Pillsbury had relaxed many of Smith 's changes , scaled back on the construction of new locations which resulted in stalled growth of the brand . Neglect of Burger King by new owner Grand Met and its successor Diageo , further hurt the standing of the brand , causing significant financial damage to BK franchises and straining relations between the parties . 
 By 2001 and after nearly 18 years of stagnant growth , the state of its franchises was beginning to affect the value of the company . One of the franchises most heavily affected by the lack of growth was the nearly 400 @-@ store AmeriKing . By 2001 , the franchise owner , which until this point had been struggling under a nearly US $ 300 million debt load and been shedding stores across the US , was forced to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy . The failure of AmeriKing deeply affected the value of Burger King , and put negotiations between <unk> and the TPC Capital @-@ led group on hold . The developments eventually forced <unk> to lower the total selling price of the chain by almost $ 750 million . After the sale , newly appointed CEO Bradley ( Brad ) Blum initiated a program to help roughly 20 percent of its franchises , including its four largest , who were in financial distress , bankruptcy or had ceased operations altogether . Partnering with California @-@ based Trinity Capital , LLC , the company established the Franchisee Financial Restructuring Initiative , a program to address the financial issues facing BK 's financially distressed franchisees . The initiative was designed to assist franchisees in restructuring their businesses to meet financial obligations , focus on restaurant operational excellence , reinvest in their operations , and return to profitability . 
 Individual franchisees took advantage of the AmeriKing failure ; one of BK 's regional owners , Miami @-@ based Al Cabrera , purchased 130 stores located primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid @-@ west region , from the failed company for a price of $ 16 million , approximately 88 percent of their original value . The new company , which started out as Core Value Partners and eventually became Heartland Foods , also purchased 120 additional stores from distressed owners and revamped them . The resulting purchases made Cabrera the largest minority franchisee of Burger King , and Heartland one of the company 's top franchises . By 2006 , the company was valued at over $ 150 million , and was sold to New York – based GSO Capital Partners . Other purchasers included a three way group of NFL athletes Kevin Faulk , Marcus Allen and Michael Strahan who collectively purchased 17 stores in the cities of Norfolk and Richmond , Virginia ; and Cincinnati @-@ based franchisee Dave Devoy , who purchased 32 AmeriKing stores . After investing in new decor , equipment and staff retraining , many of the formerly failing stores have shown growth approaching 20 percent . 
 As part of 3G 's restructuring plan , the company decided to divest itself of its corporate owned locations by re @-@ franchising them to private owners and become a 100 % franchised operation by the end of 2013 . The project , which began in April 2012 , saw the company divest corporate owned locations in Florida , Canada , Spain , Germany and other regions . The move gave the company a Q3 , 2013 profit of US $ 68 @.@ 2 million over the same quarter , 2012 of US $ 6 @.@ 6 million . 
 At the end of its 2013 fiscal year , Burger King is the second largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants in terms of global locations , behind industry bellwether McDonald 's ( 32 @,@ 400 locations ) ; it is the fourth largest fast food restaurant chain overall after Yum ! Brands ( parent of KFC , Taco Bell and Pizza Hut totaling 37 @,@ 000 locations ) , McDonald 's , and Subway ( 32 @,@ 000 locations ) . 
 = = International operations = = 
 While BK began its foray into locations outside of the continental United States in 1963 with a store in San Juan , Puerto Rico , it did not have an international presence until several years later . Shortly after the acquisition of the chain by Pillsbury , it opened its first Canadian restaurant in Windsor , Ontario in 1969 . Other international locations followed soon after : Oceania in 1971 and Europe in 1975 with a restaurant in Madrid , Spain . Beginning in 1982 , BK and its franchisees began operating stores in several East Asian countries , including Japan , Taiwan , Singapore and South Korea . Due to high competition , all of the Japanese locations were closed in 2001 ; however , BK reentered the Japanese market in June 2007 . BK 's Central and South American operations began in Mexico in the late 1970s , and by the early 1980s in Caracas , Venezuela , Santiago , Chile and Buenos Aires , Argentina . While Burger King lags behind McDonald 's in international locations by over 12 @,@ 000 stores , as of 2008 it had managed to become the largest chain in several countries including Mexico and Spain . The company divides its international operations into three segments ; The Middle East , Europe and Africa division ( EMEA ) , Asia @-@ Pacific ( APAC ) and Latin America and the Caribbean ( LAC ) . In each of these regions , Burger King has established several subsidiaries to develop strategic partnerships and alliances to expand into new territories . In its EMEA group , Burger King 's Switzerland @-@ based subsidiary Burger King Europe GmbH is responsible for the licensing and development of BK franchises in those regions . In APAC region , the Singapore @-@ based BK <unk> , Pte . Ltd. business unit handles franchising for East Asia , the Asian subcontinent and all Oceanic territories . The LAC region includes Mexico , Central and South America and the Caribbean Islands and has no centralized operations group . 
 Australia is the only country in which Burger King does not operate under its own name . When the company set about establishing operations down under in 1971 , it found that its business name was already trademarked by a takeaway food shop in Adelaide . As a result , Burger King provided the Australian franchisee , Jack Cowin , with a list of possible alternative names derived from pre @-@ existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and its then corporate parent Pillsbury , that could be used to name the Australian restaurants . Cowin selected the " Hungry Jack " brand name , one of Pillsbury 's US pancake mixture products , and slightly changed the name to a possessive form by adding an apostrophe " s " forming the new name Hungry Jack 's . After the expiration of the trademark in the late 1990s , Burger King unsuccessfully tried to introduce the brand to the continent . After losing a lawsuit filed against it by Hungry Jack 's ownership , the company ceded the territory to its franchisee . Hungry Jack 's is now the only Burger King brand in Australia ; Cowin 's company Hungry Jack 's <unk> is the master franchise and thus is now responsible for oversight of the operations that country with Burger King only providing administrative and advertising support to ensure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products . 
 Over a 10 @-@ year period starting in 2008 , Burger King predicted 80 percent of its market share would be driven by foreign expansion , particularly in the Asia @-@ Pacific and Indian subcontinent regional markets . While the TPG @-@ led group continued BK 's international expansion by announcing plans to open new franchise locations in Eastern Europe , Africa and the Middle East , and Brazil , the company plan is focusing on the three largest markets – India , China and Japan . The company plans to add over 250 stores in these Asian territories , as well as other places such as Macau , by the end of 2012 . Its expansion into the Indian market has the company at a competitive disadvantage with other fast food restaurants such as KFC because of the aversion of the country 's large Hindu majority to beef . BK hopes to use their non @-@ beef products , such as their TenderCrisp and TenderGrill chicken sandwiches , as well as other products like mutton sandwiches and veggie sandwiches , to help them overcome this hurdle to expand in that country . 3G has reported that it will continue with the plans to grow globally , even ramping up the planned expansion to help increase their return on investment . It is expected that 3G Brazilian @-@ based management connections in the region may help Burger King expand in Brazil and Latin America , where it has been having problems finding acceptable franchisees . 
 = = Controversies and legal cases = = 
 Burger King has been involved in several legal disputes and cases , as both plaintiff and defendant , in the years since its founding in 1954 . Disputes involving these many legal topics have affected almost every aspect of the company 's operations . Depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents , the company 's responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants , to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences . The company 's response to these various issues has drawn praise as well as accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years . 
 A trademark dispute involving the owners of the identically named Burger King in Mattoon , Illinois , led to a federal lawsuit . The case 's outcome helped define the scope of the Lanham act and trademark law in the United States . An existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in South Australia forced the company to change its name in Australia , while another state trademark in Texas forced the company to abandon its signature product , the Whopper , in several counties around San Antonio . Legal decisions from other suits have set contractual law precedents in regards to long @-@ arm statutes , the limitations of franchise agreements , and ethical business practices . Many of these decisions have helped define general business dealings that continue to shape the entire marketplace . 
 Controversies and disputes have arisen with groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) , governmental and social agencies , and unions and trade groups over various topics . These situations have touched on legal and moral concepts such as animal rights , corporate responsibility , ethics , and social justice . While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits , in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions , dealt with legal compliance , or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties . The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees , or how it does business with the public . 
 Further controversies have occurred during the company 's expansion in the Middle East . The opening of a Burger King location in Ma 'aleh Adumim , an Israeli settlement in the Israeli @-@ occupied Palestinian territories , led to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise due to the hotly contested international dispute over the legality of Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories in accordance to international law . The controversy eventually erupted into a geopolitical dispute involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of , and adherence to , international law . The case eventually elicited reactions from the members of the 22 @-@ nation Arab League . The Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King 's business licenses within the member states ' territories . 
 A related issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of canon law , Shariah , regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity , and , with the former example , posed a larger question about the lengths that companies must go to ensure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve .

 Burger King has two of its own in @-@ house national charitable organizations and programs . One is the Have It Your Way Foundation , a US @-@ based non @-@ profit ( 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) ) corporation with multiple focuses on hunger alleviation , disease prevention and community education through scholarship programs at colleges in the US . The other charitable organization is the McLamore Foundation , also a non @-@ profit , 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) corporation that provides scholarships to students in the US and its territories . 
 In various regions across the United States , Burger King and its franchises have aligned themselves with several charitable organizations that support research and treatment of juvenile cancer . Each year , these coalitions hold a fund raising drive called " A Chance for Kids " , in which Burger King restaurants sell lottery @-@ style scratch cards for $ 1 . Each card produces a winning prize that is usually a food or beverage product , but includes ( rarer ) items such as shopping sprees or trips . In the Northeast , BK has affiliated itself with the Major League Baseball team the Boston Red Sox and its charitable foundation , the Jimmy Fund . The group runs the contest in Boston . In the New York City area , it operates the contest in association with the Burger King Children 's Charities of Metro New York and the New York Yankees . Funds raised in these areas go to support the Dana @-@ Farber Cancer Institute , located in Boston . In Nebraska , the company is affiliated with the Liz 's Legacy Cancer Fund " BK Beat Cancer for Kids " program at the UNMC Eppley Cancer Center at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha . In the Pittsburgh region , it funded the establishment of the Burger King Cancer Caring Center , a support organization for the families and friends of cancer patients .

 When the predecessor of Burger King first opened in Jacksonville in 1953 , its menu consisted predominantly of basic hamburgers , French fries , soft drinks , milkshakes and desserts . After being acquired by its Miami , Florida , franchisees and renamed to its current moniker in 1954 , BK began expanding the breadth of its menu by adding the Whopper sandwich in 1957 . This quarter @-@ pound ( 4 oz ( 110 g ) ) hamburger was created by Burger King 's new owners James McLamore and David Edgerton as a way to differentiate BK from other burger outlets at the time . Since its inception , the Whopper has become synonymous with Burger King , and has become the focus of much of its advertising . The company even named its new kiosk @-@ style restaurants Whopper Bars . 
 The menu component of Donald Smith 's Operation Phoenix was initiated in 1978 and led to the addition of the Burger King Specialty Sandwich line in 1979 . The new product line significantly expanded the breadth of the BK menu with many non @-@ hamburger sandwiches , including new chicken and fish offerings . The new Specialty Sandwich line was one of the first attempts to target a specific demographic , in this case adults 18 – 34 , members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher quality product . One of Smith 's other significant contributions to the menu was the addition of a breakfast product line , which until this time was not a market Burger King had entered . Besides the addition of the <unk> 'Wich in 1983 , the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald 's offerings until a menu revamp in 1985 . This expansion introduced BK 's " Am Express " product line , which added new products such as French toast sticks and mini @-@ muffins . 
 As the company expanded both inside and outside the US , it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs . International variations add ingredients such as <unk> or beetroot and fried egg to the Whopper ; beer in Germany , Italy and Spain ; and halal or kosher products in the Middle East and Israel . To generate additional sales , BK will occasionally introduce limited time offers ( <unk> ) that are versions of its core products , or new products intended for either long or short term sales . Items such as the Texas Double Whopper and various sandwiches made with mushrooms and Swiss cheese have been rotated in and out of its menu for several years , while products such as its 1993 Meatloaf Specialty Sandwich offering and accompanying limited table service , along with special dinner platters , failed to generate interest and were discontinued . 
 In order to appeal to as many demographic groups as possible and better compete with its competitor Wendy 's , Burger King added a multi @-@ tiered value menu in 1993 with items priced at 99 ¢ , US $ 1 @.@ 99 and $ 2 @.@ 99 . The additions , part of then CEO James Adamson 's back to basics program also called Operation Phoenix , were an attempt to add not only a value menu , but also a line of value meals . The tiered menu was replaced with a more standard value menu in 1998 , while the value meals were separated into their own menu segment . This value menu featured seven products : Whopper Jr . , five @-@ piece Chicken Tenders , a bacon cheeseburger , medium @-@ sized French fries , medium soft drink , medium onion rings , and small shake . In 2002 and 2006 , BK revamped its value menu , adding and removing several different products such as chili and its Rodeo Cheeseburger . Many of these items have since been discontinued , modified or relegated to a regional menu option . To better appeal to a more adult palate and demographic , BK introduced several new products to its menu in 2003 , including several new or revamped chicken products , a new salad line and its BK Joe brand of coffee . Some of the new products , including its Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line , brought negative attention due to the large portion size , and amounts of unhealthy fats and trans @-@ fats . Many of these products featured higher quality ingredients like whole chicken breast , Angus beef , and natural cheeses such as cheddar and pepper jack . Again , not all these products , such as the BK Baguette line , have met corporate sales expectations . 
 With the purchase of the company in 2010 , 3G began a program to restructure its menu designed to move away from the male @-@ oriented menu that had dominated under the previous ownership . The first major item to be introduced was a reformulation of its BK Chicken Tenders product in March 2011 . Over the next few months , approximately 20 new products were researched and developed while others were reformulated , including its Chef 's Choice Burger . Eventually pruned down to 10 items , Burger King began deploying the items in the United States throughout 2011 – 2012 with the official roll out beginning April 2012 . The changes included new ice cream products , smoothies , <unk> and chicken strips . The Whopper was the most prominently reformulated product in this round of introductions with a new type of cheese and packaging . 
 = = = Equipment = = = 
 Like its menu , the equipment the company cooks its hamburgers with has also evolved as the company expanded . The burgers have always been broiled mechanically ; the original unit , called an Insta @-@ Broiler , was one of two pieces of equipment the founders of Insta @-@ Burger King purchased before opening their new restaurant . The Insta @-@ Broiler worked by cooking 12 burger patties in a wire basket , allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously . When McLamore and Edgerton took over the company , besides dropping the " <unk> " prefix , they switched to an improved unit , which they called a " Flame Broiler " . Designed by the two and featuring stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain , the unit broke down less often , while maintaining a similar cooking rate . The company would stay with that format for the next 40 years until Burger King began developing a variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times . These new units began testing in 1999 and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed system @-@ wide in 2008 – 2009 . Accompanying these new broilers was new food @-@ holding equipment , accompanied with a computer @-@ based product monitoring system for its cooked products . The monitoring system allows for more concise tracking of product quality , while giving the company and its franchisees a method to streamline costs by more precisely projecting sales and product usage . 
 = = Advertising = = 
 Since its foundation in 1954 , Burger King has employed varied advertising programs , both successful and unsuccessful . During the 1970s , output included its Hold the pickles , hold the lettuce ... jingle , the inspiration for its current mascot the Burger King , and several well known and parodied slogans such as " Have it your way " and " It takes two hands to handle a Whopper " . Burger King introduced the first attack ad in the fast food industry with a pre @-@ teen Sarah Michelle Gellar in 1981 . The television spot , which claimed BK burgers were larger and better tasting than competitor McDonald 's , so enraged executives at McDonald 's parent company that they sued all parties involved . Starting in the early 1980s and running through approximately 2001 , BK engaged a series of ad agencies that produced many unsuccessful slogans and programs , including its biggest advertising flop " Where 's Herb ? " . 
 Burger King was a pioneer in the advertising practice known as the " product tie @-@ in " , with a successful partnership with George Lucas ' Lucasfilm , Ltd . , to promote the 1977 film Star Wars in which BK sold a set of glasses featuring the main characters from the movie . This promotion was one of the first in the fast food industry and set the pattern that continues to the present . BK 's early success in the field was overshadowed by a 1982 deal between McDonald 's and the Walt Disney Company to promote Disney 's animated films beginning in the mid @-@ 1980s and running through the early 1990s . In 1994 , Disney switched from McDonald 's to Burger King , signing a 10 @-@ movie promotional contract which would include such top 10 films as Aladdin ( 1992 ) , Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 ) , The Lion King ( 1994 ) , and Toy Story ( 1995 ) . A partnership in association with the Pokémon franchise at the height of its popularity in 1999 was tremendously successful for the company , with many locations rapidly selling out of the toys and the replacements . 
 Shortly after the acquisition of Burger King by TPG Capital , L.P. in 2002 , its new CEO Brad Blum set about turning around the fortunes of the company by initiating an overhaul of its flailing advertising programs . One of the first moves by the company was to reinstate its famous " Have it your way " slogan as the corporate motto . BK handed the effort off to its new advertising agency , Miami @-@ based Crispin Porter + Bogusky ( abbreviated as CP + B ) . CP + B was known for having a hip , subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients , exactly what BK was looking for . One of CP + B strategies was to revive the Burger King character used during BK 's 1970s / 1980s Burger King Kingdom children 's advertising campaign as a caricatured variation , now simply called " the King " . The farcical nature of " the Burger King " centered advertisements inspired an internet meme where the King is edited into unusual situations that are either comical or menacing , many times followed with the phrase " Where is your God now ? " 
 Additionally , CP + B created a series of new characters like the Subservient Chicken and the faux nu metal band Coq Roq , featured in a series of viral web @-@ based advertisements on sites such as MySpace and various BK corporate pages , to complement various television and print promotional campaigns . One of the more successful promotions that CP + B devised was the creation of a series of three <unk> for the Xbox 360 . Created by UK based Blitz Games and featuring company celebrity spokesman Brooke Burke , the games sold more than 3 @.@ 2 million copies , placing them as one of the top selling games along with another Xbox 360 hit , Gears of War . These ad campaigns , coupled with other new promotions and a series of new product introductions , drew positive and negative attention to BK , and helped TPG and its partners realize about US $ 367 million in dividends . 
 With the late @-@ 2000s recession hitting the 18 – 35 demographic targeted by the CP + B created ads particularly hard , the company saw its market share decline and the company move into the red . After the completion of the sale of the company in late 2010 , the new ownership group terminated Burger King 's seven @-@ year relationship with CP + B and hired rival firm McGarryBowen to create a new campaign with an expanded market reach . As part of the new campaign , McGarryBowen terminated the use of The Burger King in the company 's advertising program in favor of a new program that focused on the food and ingredients in its new advertising campaigns .

 Lewisville / <unk> / is a city in Denton County , Texas , United States . It is a northwestern suburb of Dallas . The 2000 United States Census placed the city 's population at 77 @,@ 737 and the 2010 Census placed it at 95 @,@ 290 , making it one of the fastest @-@ growing city populations in the United States and the 33rd most populous in Texas . It occupies 36 @.@ 4 square miles ( 94 km2 ) of land and includes 6 @.@ 07 square miles ( 15 @.@ 7 km2 ) of Lewisville Lake . 
 Originally called Holford 's Prairie , the origins of Lewisville date back to the early 1840s . The arrival of the town 's first railroad in 1881 engendered its initial growth , and the expansion of the area 's transportation infrastructure spurred further development in the early part of the 20th century . Lewisville incorporated in 1925 , and when construction of Lewisville Lake was completed in the 1950s , the city began to expand rapidly . 
 Lewisville 's consistently warm climate and proximity to Lewisville Lake has made it a recreational hub of the Dallas – Fort Worth metroplex . The city 's municipal government , led by a nonpartisan city council , focuses its recreational and cultural investments on facilities such as Toyota of Lewisville Park and the MCL Grand Theater . The area 's transportation infrastructure has evolved around the I @-@ 35 Corridor along Interstate 35E . The diversity of its population and industry has created a stable economic climate . Lewisville Independent School District provides most of the area 's public education programs .

 = = = Settlement = = = 
 In 1841 , the Republic of Texas chartered the Peters Colony Land Grant Company ( named for William Smalling Peters , publisher of the song " Oh ! Susanna " ) to settle the North Texas area . In 1844 , John W. King and his wife settled on the east side of the prairie , where the city now lies . Baptist settlers from Platte County , Missouri , settled on the west side ; among them were John and James Holford , who named the area Holford 's Prairie . Further south , Presbyterians established a church and called it Flower Mound . In the confusion over land ownership after the <unk> War , <unk> Lewis purchased Holford 's Prairie in 1853 and renamed it after himself . 
 In 1845 , the Fox family , which owned about a dozen slaves , buried a slave child called Melinda on the family farm , which eventually became the town 's cemetery for black residents . Named Fox – <unk> Cemetery , the plot still exists today . After it had fallen into disrepair , local residents and businesses gathered to restore it in 2011 . Though Abraham Lincoln was not on the ballot in the area for the 1860 Presidential election , residents of Lewisville ( listed as " <unk> " on election results ) still gave John C. Breckinridge only a 44 – 31 majority over an electoral fusion option . 
 During Reconstruction , Lewisville became home to Denton County 's first cotton gin . Built in 1867 , it could produce up to three bales per day . The Thirteenth Texas Legislature chartered the Dallas and Wichita Railroad ( later the Missouri – Kansas – Texas ) on terms requiring 20 miles of track to be in running order by July 1 , 1875 . Lewisville paid the company $ 15 @,@ 000 to come to the city , with a promise of another $ 5 @,@ 000 on completion . The company fulfilled the deal by completing the railroad tracks to a point just south of Lewisville on the morning of the deadline , and the line began running full @-@ time in 1881 . Republicans in the Fourteenth Texas Legislature passed a law on April 30 , 1874 , prohibiting alcohol within two miles of the town . Many residents ignored the law , however , and the city retained as many as 17 saloons at one point . The population of the unincorporated town was 500 in 1888 . 
 = = = Progress = = = 
 On January 15 , 1925 , residents voted by a margin of 17 votes to incorporate Lewisville , which established its official boundaries as a city . By 1930 , Lewisville 's population had increased to 853 , making it the fourth most populous municipality in Denton County ( behind Denton , Sanger , and Pilot Point ) . 
 Because the city 's economy had become diversified before the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , Lewisville was relatively well insulated from the Great Depression . Many residents , including business leaders , nevertheless supported the New Deal programs of Franklin D. Roosevelt . By 1936 , the Works Progress Administration operated a cannery in the city to provide temporary jobs for unemployed residents . As an extension of the Good Roads Movement , which had been prominent in Denton County since the early 1910s , residents formed the Good Roads Committee of Lewisville to lobby state and federal officials for funding to create better streets . Lewisville celebrated the paving of the U.S. Route 77 between Denton and Dallas in 1931 with a " Coming Out of the Mud " ceremony . The new pavement closed the " Lewisville Gap " between the two cities , a stretch of dirt road through the city that often became too muddy for travel . 
 The new road also led indirectly to the downfall of the area 's public transportation system . Between 1925 and 1932 , the Texas Interurban Railway , an electric commuter rail service that ran from Dallas to Denton , operated a station in Lewisville . Business leaders in the Lewisville Chamber of Commerce welcomed the service at the time , proudly citing the city 's progressive citizenship . The area 's low population density could not sustain the venture , however , and in 1932 , the line went out of business and immediately halted service . 
 On April 25 , 1934 , Raymond Hamilton of the Barrow Gang robbed the First National Bank of Lewisville . Residents chased him to Howe , Texas , where he was captured at a roadblock and transferred to Dallas County Jail .

 Cleveland has four daily trains : the Capitol Limited ( trains 29 and 30 ) between Washington , D.C. and Chicago , and the Lake Shore Limited ( trains 48 / 448 and 49 / 449 ) between Chicago and New York City / Boston . As of January 2014 , these trains were scheduled to arrive / depart from Cleveland at various times between 1 : 00 a.m. and 5 : 50 a.m. The timing of the departures and arrivals has drawn criticism , with Amtrak also trying to tinker with train schedules through suggestions , reminding people that the schedules are not set in stone . 
 The Cleveland RTA Rapid Waterfront Line tracks separate the station building and Amtrak platform . There is no platform for the Waterfront Line trains , but they will stop at the station upon request , with passengers discharging at the at @-@ grade pedestrian connection to the building . As such , the stop is not wheelchair accessible . Disabled passengers must instead board or disembark at the North Coast station , which is within walking distance to the Amtrak station . However , the Waterfront Line currently does not run during most of the time of day that includes Amtrak arrivals or departures . 
 The Lake Shore Limited has served Lakefront Station from its opening in 1977 . The Capitol Limited began stopping at Lakefront on November 12 , 1990 , after Conrail 's abandonment of portions of the ex @-@ Pittsburgh , Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway in northwestern Indiana forced the re @-@ routing of that train along with the Broadway Limited . Previously it had passed to the south , serving Canton . Between 1998 and 2003 , the Pennsylvanian served Cleveland , providing daylight service to Chicago and Philadelphia . Weak ridership prompted Amtrak to return the train to a Pittsburgh – New York schedule .

 The two Amtrak tracks share an island platform ; the RTA tracks do not have any platforms . The structure has a porte @-@ cochère , which protects passengers from inclement weather . The interior was built with a similar design to that of the exterior , and features a central skylight . Shadows from its exposed trusses create different patterns on the brown brick floor , built in a basket @-@ weaved pattern . Exposed ductwork is visible throughout the trusses , as are the light fixtures . All of the ceiling elements are painted white , which tend to recede and produce a sense of <unk> which is further enhanced by the floor @-@ to @-@ ceiling windows . Banks of seats are located close to public telephones and a vending area .

 Amtrak used to run its trains through Cleveland Union Terminal ( now Tower City Center ) , which was built in 1928 and served as the main terminal for the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit , and in 1955 , the crosstown Red Line . By 1976 , because of Cleveland Union Terminal 's high rent , the massive size of the facility , and the need to switch to electric locomotives to access its enclosed platforms , Amtrak decided to construct a smaller station . Lakefront Station was built in 1976 – 1977 and opened for service in 1977 to provide service for the Lake Shore Limited , which had resumed service via Toledo in 1975 . The station officially opened on June 29 , 1977 , with the formal dedication occurring on July 12 . According to Amtrak 's employee magazine , a crowd of more than 300 gathered for the dedication of the $ 552 @,@ 000 depot . Speakers included Mary J. Head , vice chairman of the Amtrak Board of Directors , and Cleveland Mayor Ralph J. Perk . Following the dedication ceremony , attendees were invited to tour the facility and enjoy cake and coffee . 
 Lakefront Station 's lack of modernization since its opening has become more noticeable , especially its appearance and lack of adequate signage . In August 2012 , when the Cleveland Convention Center was under construction , a Cuyahoga County official expressed a desire to keep Lakefront Station out of view . One proposed solution was to build a new station underground , but due to a lack of funding , the county settled on hiding the station behind trees and shrubs as a short @-@ term solution .

 Juniper Networks is a multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale , California that develops and markets networking products . Its products include routers , switches , network management software , network security products and software @-@ defined networking technology . 
 Juniper was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu . The company received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999 . Juniper grew to $ 673 million in annual revenues by 2000 . By 2001 it had a 37 percent share of the core routers market , challenging Cisco 's once @-@ dominant market @-@ share . It grew to $ 4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $ 4 @.@ 63 billion in 2014 . Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008 , Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014 . 
 Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers , which are used by internet service providers ( ISPs ) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic . Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002 , Juniper entered the market for edge routers , which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers . Juniper entered the IT security market with its own <unk> security toolkit in 2003 , before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year . It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s , which accounted for one @-@ third of revenues by 2005 . As of 2014 , Juniper has been focused on developing new software @-@ defined networking products . However , in 2016 , the company encountered some controversy under suspicion allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products .

 = = = Origins and funding = = = 
 Juniper Networks was founded in February 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu , a scientist with Xerox ’ s Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) . He conceived the idea for Juniper while on vacation in 1995 . At the time most routers used for internet traffic were intended for phone calls and had dedicated circuits for each caller ; he wanted to create packet @-@ based routers that were optimized for internet traffic . Sindhu was joined by engineers Bjorn <unk> from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications . 
 Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $ 2 million in seed funding , which was followed by $ 12 million in funding in the company 's first year of operations . About seven months after the company 's founding , Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business , while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer . By February 1997 , Juniper had raised $ 8 million in venture funding . Later that year , Juniper raised an additional $ 40 million in investments from a round that included four out five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers : Siemens , Ericsson , Nortel and 3Com . Juniper also received $ 2 @.@ 5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT & T. 
 = = = Growth and IPO = = = 
 Juniper had $ 3 @.@ 8 million in annual revenue in 1998 . By the following year , its only product , the M40 router , was being used by 50 telecommunications companies . Juniper signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally . A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia @-@ Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong . A subsidiary was created in Japan and offices were established in Korea in 1999 . Juniper 's market share for core routers grew from 6 % in 1998 to 17 @.@ 5 % one year later , and 20 % by April 2000 . 
 Juniper filed for an initial public offering in April 1999 and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June . The stock set a record in first @-@ day trading in the technology sector by increasing 191 % to a market capitalization of $ 4 @.@ 9 billion . According to Telephony , Juniper Networks became the " latest darling of Wall Street " , reaching a $ 7 billion valuation by late July . Within a year , the company 's stock grew five @-@ fold . 
 Juniper 's revenues grew 600 % in 2000 to $ 673 million . That same year , Juniper moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale , California . 
 = = = Competition = = = 
 By 2001 , Juniper controlled one @-@ third of the market for high @-@ end core routers , mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales . According to BusinessWeek , " analysts unanimously agree [ d ] that Juniper 's boxes [ were ] technically superior to Cisco 's because the hardware does most of the data processing . Cisco routers still relied on software , which often results in slower speeds . " However , Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position . The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a " David versus Goliath " story . Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes , businesses and for ISPs , whereas Juniper was thought of as the " anti @-@ Cisco " for being a small company with a narrow focus . 
 In January 2001 , Cisco introduced a suite of router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper 's increasing market @-@ share . According to BusinessWeek , Juniper 's top @-@ end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products . Cisco 's routers were not expected to erode Juniper 's growing share of the market , but other companies such as Lucent , Alcatel , and startups <unk> Systems and <unk> had announced plans to release products that would out @-@ pace Juniper 's routers . 
 Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge , where it would also compete with Cisco . Juniper 's edge routers had a 9 % market share two months after release . Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims ; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper , whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion . By 2002 , both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a " ' speeds @-@ and @-@ feeds ' public relations contest " . 
 By 2004 , Juniper controlled 38 % of the core router market . By 2007 , it had a 5 % , 18 % and 30 % share of the market for enterprise , edge and core routers respectively . Alcatel @-@ Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market , but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers , along with Cisco . 
 = = = Further development = = = 
 In late 2000 , Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices , and with Nortel for fiber optic technology . In 2001 , Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China . Juniper 's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown and revenues fell by two @-@ thirds during the dot @-@ com bust . 9 to 10 % of its workforce was laid off . 
 Juniper had rebounded by 2004 , surpassing $ 1 billion in revenues for the first time that year and reaching $ 2 billion in revenue in 2005 . Beginning in 2004 , with the acquisition of NetScreen , Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment . Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs , not enterprises , which it was trying to change . By 2005 enterprise customers accounted for one @-@ third of the company 's revenues , but it had spent $ 5 billion in acquisitions and R & D for the enterprise market . 
 In 2006 , more than 200 US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices . Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly . In December 2006 , Juniper restated its financials , charging $ 900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003 . This was followed by a $ 169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010 . 
 = = = 2008 – present = = = 
 In July 2008 Juniper 's first CEO , Scott Kriens , became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO . Johnson focused the company more on software , creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague , Bob Muglia . Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company 's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system . Juniper established partnerships with IBM , Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts . The SSL / VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010 , then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $ 250 million . 
 In 2012 , Juniper laid off 5 % of its staff and four of its high @-@ ranking executives departed . The following year , CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found . In November 2013 , Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO . He started the position in January 2014 . 
 In January 2014 , hedge fund , activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs , before Kheradpir was officially appointed . That February , Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan ( <unk> ) that involved <unk> $ 2 billion in shares , reducing operating expenses by $ 160 million and appointing two new directors to its board . That April , 6 % of the company 's staff were laid off to cut expenses . In November 2014 , Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper 's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer . An internal Juniper executive , Rami Rahim , took his place as CEO . 
 In May 2014 , Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a $ 175 million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper 's patents for application firewalls . 
 = = Acquisitions and investments = = 
 By 2001 , Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies , due to the leadership 's preference for organic growth . The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks . In 2004 Juniper made a $ 4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies . Juniper revised NetScreen 's channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market . 
 Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005 , mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $ 8 @.@ 7 to $ 337 million . It acquired application @-@ acceleration vendor Redline Networks , VOIP company <unk> Networks , as well as wide area network ( WAN ) company <unk> Networks . <unk> and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper 's <unk> framework . Afterwards , Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until 2010 . 
 From 2010 to September 2011 , Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies . Often Juniper acquired early @-@ stage startups , developing their technology , than selling it to pre @-@ existing Juniper clients . Juniper acquired two digital video companies , <unk> Networks and <unk> Inc . , as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks . In 2012 , Juniper acquired Mykonos Software , which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network <unk> and a developer of software @-@ defined network controllers , Contrail Systems . In 2014 Juniper acquired the software @-@ defined networking ( SDN ) company <unk> .

 Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products , such as routers , switches and IT security products . It started out selling core routers for ISPs , and expanded into edge routers , data centers , wireless networking , networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices . 
 Juniper is the third largest market @-@ share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs . According to analyst firm Dell 'Oro Group , it is the fourth largest for edge routers and second for core routers with 25 % of the core market . It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24 @.@ 8 % share of the firewall market . In data center security appliances , Juniper is the second @-@ place market @-@ share holder behind Cisco . In <unk> , where Juniper holds a joint development and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks , it holds a more marginal market share . Juniper provides technical support and services through the J @-@ Care program . 
 As of February 2015 , Juniper 's product families include the following : 
 = = = <unk> and switches = = = 
 Juniper Networks ' first product was the Junos router operating system , which was released on July 1 , 1998 . The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40 . It incorporated specialized Application @-@ specific integrated circuits ( ASIC ) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM . It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products . The M40 was followed by the smaller M20 router in December 1999 and the <unk> in March 2000 . 
 By 2000 , Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system . That April , Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers . In April 2002 , Juniper released the first of the T @-@ series family ( originally known under the code @-@ name Gibson ) , which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the <unk> . The first products of the TX Matrix family , which could be used to combine up to four T @-@ series routers , was released in December 2004 . 
 By 2003 , Juniper had diversified into three major router applications : core routers , edge routers and routers for mobile traffic . Juniper 's first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers , by acquiring the e @-@ series product family ( originally known as <unk> ) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000 . By 2002 , both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers , because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core . Several improvements to Juniper 's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003 . At this time , Juniper had the largest market @-@ share ( 52 % ) of the broadband aggregation market . In 2003 , Juniper entered the market for cable @-@ modem termination systems with the G @-@ series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband . The product family was discontinued later that year . 
 Juniper 's first enterprise switch product was the EX 4200 , which was released in 2008 . In a comparative technical test , Network World said the <unk> was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput , but its multicast features were " newer and less robust " than other aspects of the product . Juniper Networks announced the <unk> 1 @.@ 6 <unk> per second core router in 2007 and the newer <unk> 4 <unk> router in 2010 . In 2012 it released the ACX family of universal access routers . In 2013 , the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers : it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called <unk> , and several new enterprise routers were released . Seven months later , Juniper acquired <unk> , and its technology was integrated into the <unk> WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014 . 
 In February 2011 , Juniper introduced <unk> , a proprietary protocol methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer . Several individual products for the <unk> methodology were released throughout the year . In October 2013 Juniper introduced another network architecture called <unk> and a new set of switches , the <unk> family , as one of the foundations of the new architecture . 
 In February 2014 , several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers , including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet @-@ based services to consumers . In December 2014 , Juniper introduced a network switch , <unk> , that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open @-@ source software . 
 = = = Security = = = 
 Juniper Networks introduced the <unk> security toolkit in May 2003 . It included firewalls , flow monitoring , filtering and Network Address Translation ( NAT ) . Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies , Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line , as well as remote desktop access software . The NetScreen @-@ <unk> ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition and its first wireless product . The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004 . An open interface for the development of third party tools for the appliance was made available that September . 
 In September 2004 , Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J @-@ series product family . It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market . Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control ( NAC ) product in late 2005 , which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches . According to a 2006 review in Network World , Juniper 's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was " the first serious threat " to competing products from Cisco . Juniper released the <unk> family of gateway products in 2008 . The gateways sold well , but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010 , which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012 , when it began providing updates to the product software . 
 In August 2011 , Juniper and AT & T announced they would jointly develop the AT & T Mobile Security application based on Juniper 's Pulse security software . In May 2012 , Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February . Mykonos ' software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity . In January 2014 , Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines . The following month , Juniper released several products for " intrusion deception " , which create fake files , store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter . 
 An analysis of Juniper 's ScreenOS firmware code in December 2015 discovered a backdoor key using Dual _ EC _ <unk> allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS . This backdoor was inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of ScreenOS from <unk> to <unk> and from <unk> to <unk> and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password . Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS . Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that " If this backdoor was not intentional , then , in my opinion , it ’ s an amazing coincidence . " 
 In December 2015 Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered " unauthorized code " in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices , present from 2012 onwards . There were two vulnerabilities : One was a simple root password backdoor , and the other one was changing a point in Dual _ EC _ <unk> so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting ( intentional or unintentional ) <unk> backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic .

 According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine , in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software @-@ defined networking ( SDN ) . It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December 2012 . The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy , which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system . In February 2013 , Juniper released several SDN products , including the application provisioning software , Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance . 
 In May 2013 , Juniper announced an SDN controller called <unk> Contrail , using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems . A series of SDN products were released in February 2014 , such as a network management software product , Junos Fusion , and an SDN controller called <unk> .

About 50 % of Juniper 's revenues are derived from routers , 13 % from switches , 12 % comes from IT security and 25 % from services . 
 According to a 2013 report by <unk> , Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about $ 24 @,@ 000 per year . It operates the Juniper Network 's Academic Alliance program , which scouts fresh college graduates . 
 According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine , Juniper has " a strong focus " on research and development . R & D expenses have been between 22 and 25 % of revenue from 2011 to 2013 . Most of the company 's manufacturing is outsourced to three manufacturing companies : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Technology . Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund , which was started with $ 50 million in 2010 and invests in early @-@ stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system . As of 2011 , Juniper had invested in 20 companies . This is estimated to be 1 to 2 % of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment . 
 = The Age of Plastic = 
 The Age of Plastic is the debut studio album by the British new wave duo The Buggles , composed of Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes . The name of the record was conceived from the group 's intention of being a " plastic group " . The album has lyrical themes of nostalgia and anxiety about the possible effects of modern technology . The titular song , " Living in the Plastic Age " , views the experiences of watching media coverage of the Vietnam War , while " Kid Dynamo " follows a child overexposed to media and its resulting effects on him . Described by writers as the first technopop landmark , the record is an electropop new wave album that includes musical elements and influences of disco , punk , progressive rock and 1960s pop music . In a 1979 interview , Downes defined the album as " science fiction music . It 's like modern psychedelic music . It 's very futuristic . " Horn used pre @-@ dated technology for the album to have sounds unlike what was typical in records that were released at the time . The songs were written by The Buggles between 1977 and 1979 , with contributions on several tracks from Bruce Woolley . The backing tracks were recorded at Virgin 's Town House in West London , while the vocals were recorded and mixed at Sarm East Studios . Mixing was completed before Christmas 1979 . 
 The Age of Plastic was released by Island Records in Australia in January 1980 , and later in February in the UK . The album 's release followed the success of the group 's 1979 first single , " Video Killed the Radio Star " , which reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart . Most of the songs for the album were written during promotion of the song . Three subsequent singles , " The Plastic Age " , " Clean , Clean " and " Elstree " , all released in 1980 , followed " Video " , and also charted in the UK , reaching number 16 , 38 and 55 respectively . In Europe , The Age of Plastic reached the Top 20 in Italy and the Top 40 in France , Norway , Sweden and the United Kingdom . In other continents , the album reached the top 40 in Japan and was number 83 on the Canadian RPM albums chart . It has been met with positive critical response , with some critics comparing it to other albums of its genre . There have been two reissues of the album , in 2000 and in 2010 . A September 2010 performance of the album by the Buggles , a gig live at the " Ladbroke Grove 's Supperclub " in Notting Hill , London , marked the first time the group performed it in its entirety . 
 = = Background and production = = 
 Geoff Downes formed The Buggles in 1977 in Wimbledon , South West London with Trevor Horn and Bruce Woolley . The trio had done rough demos of early compositions such as " Video Killed the Radio Star " , " Clean , Clean " , and " On TV " , a track later included on their second album Adventures in Modern Recording . Talking about the formation of the Buggles , Downes said about the demos : 
 “ We ’ d sort out the songs at my place and do all the arrangements together . Later we ’ d kick the artist out of the studio and spent most of the studio time just doing different things of our own , using every moment to our best advantage . It was a big experience for both of us and after a couple of years of doing that , we had quite a few songs together ... It was at that stage that we decided to become artists . We felt that it was about time that somebody started making good , well @-@ produced pop records again . We wanted to give people something more than they already had . ” 
 The Buggles were signed to Island Records , who gave Horn and Downes recording and publishing contracts , and started recording their upcoming first studio album in the first half of 1979 . Although Woolley was originally intended to be the band 's lead vocalist , he left the group during the sessions to form his own band , The Camera Club , who also did versions of " Clean , Clean " and " Video " that appeared on their album English Garden . When " Video Killed the Radio Star " was a huge commercial success , they had realized the problem that they had not finished an album 's worth of material yet , so they wrote more during the promotion of the single , while in airport lounges , dressing rooms , rehearsal rooms and studios . 
 = = Production process = = 
 The Age of Plastic had a budget of £ 60 @,@ 000 . Hugh Padgham recorded the backing tracks at Virgin 's Town House in West London , due to Sarm East 's very small size and Horn wanting to record real drums . The Buggles went to London ’ s Wardour Street to gain the attention of and record two females to appear on the album . The mixing and Horn 's vocal recording were later done at Sarm East Studios , and mixing was finished before Christmas 1979 for a new year 's release of the album . Sarm East mixer Gary Langan used a 40 @-@ input Trident <unk> console to record and mix the album , which was housed inside the same control room as two Studer A80 24 @-@ track machines and outboard gear that included an EMT 140 echo plate , Eventide digital delay , Eventide phaser , Marshall Time Modulator , <unk> noise gates , <unk> and Orban EQs , and <unk> 1176 , <unk> 160 , and UA <unk> and <unk> compressors . 
 The vocals of the album were recorded at Sarm East to a click track using a Roland TR @-@ 808 drum machine , and other various machines and boxes sync ’ ed up the tracks . As Langan recalls : " In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push what we had to the limit ... If , for instance , something required an effect , whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big , delayed reverb , the art was to get that effect right and record it ... It all had to be done and then , as I said , it would influence the next process . " Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem , due to no available terabytes of storage . He stated : " We 'd make it as clean as we possibly could , bounce that down to two tracks and then we 'd erase . " 
 = = Music development and arrangement = = 
 The Age of Plastic lasts for a total length of 36 minutes and 24 seconds . Unable to make the album sound like what was typical of other records released in the late 1970s , as well as finding it boring , Horn " figured that if I couldn 't get records to sound like Elton John , which I couldn 't because I couldn 't figure out how they did it , then whatever I could do , I 'd better exaggerate it . " He had also wanted to " perverse things with sound , except that in 1978 and 1979 , none of the equipment which would later allow me to do that was available . So I had to pre @-@ date that technology by finding my own ways of achieving certain sounds . " Audio noted the album 's sound to be reminiscent of duo Godley & Creme 's debut album Consequences . 
 Writers have labeled The Age of Plastic as the first landmark of another electropop era . In his book Are We Not New Wave ? : Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s , Theo <unk> wrote that the album 's title and the songs " I Love You ( Miss Robot ) " and " Astroboy " " picture the arrival of the 1980s as a novelty era of playful futurism " . In a 1979 interview , Downes defined the album as " science fiction music . It 's like modern psychedelic music . It 's very futuristic . " Writers have described it as a mixture of synthpop and new wave music , with elements of disco , punk , progressive rock and pop music from the 1960s . The music on the album was also influenced by groups such as 10cc , ELO and Kraftwerk . 
 Journalists noted the tracks ' instrumentations of guitars , bass guitar , drums , vocoded , robotic and female vocals , and synthesizers used to emulate orchestral instruments , and well as compositional elements of a variety of complex builds . Downes said that he used five synthesizers in making The Age of Plastic , which were used to " fake up things and to provide effects we won ’ t use them in the manner that somebody like John Foxx does . " According to Horn : " We used about three different drummers including one from Landscape and Johnny Richardson from The <unk> , who ’ s really good . We also used the occasional session guitarist to play various bits and there were three or four girl singers involved . Apart from that , we did everything ourselves . " Downes claimed of using George Shearing 's trick of doubling melody lines in block chords very heavily on some of the songs . 
 = = Lyrics and song information = = 
 The Age of Plastic is a tragicomic concept album with lyrical themes of intense nostalgia and anxiety about the possible effects of modern technology . The lyrics , which were written by Trevor Horn , were inspired by the works of J.G. Ballard . The Buggles claimed they were necessarily a " plastic group " to meet the needs of a plastic age , which was why their debut album was called The Age of Plastic . Downes said that the lyrics were " trying to make cynical comments on a number of issues . " Eight tracks are included on The Age of Plastic : " Living in the Plastic Age " , " Video Killed the Radio Star " , " Kid Dynamo " , " I Love You ( Miss Robot ) " , " Clean , Clean " , " Elstree " , " Astroboy ( And the Proles on Parade ) " , and " Johnny ( on the Monorail ) " . The album 's lyrical concept was compared by Orange Coast magazine to that of the works of Canadian progressive rock band Klaatu . 
 The Age of Plastic starts with the title track " The Plastic Age , " which , according to Downes , is about a person 's view of plastic experiences from watching and reading news reports on the Vietnam War . " Video Killed the Radio Star , " the second track , refers to a period of technological change in the 1960s , the desire to remember the past and the disappointment that children of the current generation would not appreciate the past . The fast @-@ paced third song , " Kid Dynamo , " is about the effects of media on a futuristic kid of the 1980s . " I Love You ( Miss Robot ) " is the album 's fourth track , that Downes said it talks about " being on the road and making love to someone you don 't really like , while all the time you 're wanting to phone someone who 's a long way off . " Wave Maker Magazine viewed the song as " a darkly soothing , bass guitar @-@ driven ballad which brings us back into cyberpunk country . " 
 " Clean , Clean " is the album 's fifth track , and follows the story of a young boy who grows out of being a gangster , and , despite not willing to do so , he will at least try to keep the fighting clean . Wave Maker Magazine found " Elstree , " the album 's sixth song , as lyrically similar to " Video Killed the Radio Star , " as it follows " a failed actor taking up a more regular position behind the scenes and looking back at his life in regret . " The slow @-@ tempo ballad " Astroboy ( And the Proles on Parade ) " , according to Wave Maker , " once again revisits cyberpunk with a much lighter vibe , although the keyboards do occasionally border darker realms , <unk> [ sic ] with the post @-@ chorus hook , " and the album closer " Johnny on the Monorail " has a " pop atmosphere " that " better suits the flow of the rest of the album .

 = = Critical reception = = 
 Most reviews of The Age of Plastic have been approving , with some critics comparing it to other albums of its genre . Melody Maker noted that the album is " all jerky <unk> and absurdly inflated post @-@ punk melodrama " and named it as " essential " . The Canberra Times 's Keith <unk> found the production excellent and said the album sounded " crisp as fresh dollar bills " . The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction described the LP as " one of the best examples of the decade 's characteristically disposable pop " , while Spin named it one of the " 8 Essentials of Post @-@ Kraftwerk Pop " . 
 In a retrospective review , Jeri Montesano from AllMusic gave the album 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars and described it as " a fun record that doesn 't need to be taken too seriously " . He further said that " it would be difficult to find a record from this era that sounds half as good . Pop rarely reaches these heights . " While reviewing the Buggles ' second album , the same author stated that both albums " still sound fresh " compared to 1990s pop music . An Amazon.com editor named Grant Alden also compared the album to 1990s pop , and labeled the group as " Part of the early @-@ 1980s great explosion of pop music [ ... ] to have any real impact " . Trouser Press called both albums " technically stunning , reasonably catchy and <unk> hollow . " 
 Smash Hits rated the album 8 out of 10 and called it " quite human and therefore the most enjoyable of the lot " . In a review of the 1999 re @-@ release of the album , Vincent L. of <unk> Magazine praised the entire record because it contains " catchy tracks and joyful melodies " . Napster 's Nicholas Baker liked the album 's composition and concluded " this LP is not so much a guilty pleasure as an essential point in electropop history . " Metro Pulse 's Anthony <unk> found the tunes " punchy , memorable " and " accessible " , concluding his review with " If all rock records sounded like this — shiny and slick and highly processed — the world would be terrible . But a few Trevor Horns — people who use studio technology the way a curious and playful child uses a room full of <unk> toys — are nice to have around . " 
 On the mixed to negative side , Joseph Stannard , in his review for Adventures in Modern Recording , opined The Age of Plastic " sounds like unfinished business , a series of good ideas in need of elaboration " . Dave Marsh and John Swenson , writing for The Rolling Stone Record Guide , opined that " aside from the wonderful ' Video Killed the Radio Star ' — perhaps the most successful recent example of a single where the production was catchier than the material " , the album was " high @-@ tech dreck " . Betty Page from Sounds commented that the group " stretches uncomfortably out into the long playing medium like a <unk> of well @-@ chewed bubblegum . " In a review of the 1999 reissue of the album , Richard Wallace of Daily Mirror wrote that the record " shows how [ The Buggles ] pioneered the synth @-@ led nonsense which fused much of the decade 's pop , but had little creative imagination . That bombastic electro @-@ sound became [ Trevor ] Horn 's trademark as a producer . Skip it . " Alexis Petridis of The Guardian has been the harshest on the LP , calling it " awful beyond measure " and " everything bad that people say about the music industry : it 's wasteful , it 's stupid , it has no interest in actual music .

 = Kingdom of East Anglia = 
 The Kingdom of the East Angles ( Old English : <unk> Engla <unk> ; Latin : Regnum Orientalium Anglorum ) , today known as the Kingdom of East Anglia , was a small independent kingdom of the Angles comprising what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps the eastern part of the Fens . The kingdom formed in the 6th century in the wake of the Anglo @-@ Saxon settlement of Britain . It was ruled by the Wuffingas in the 7th and 8th centuries , but fell to Mercia in 794 , and was conquered by the Danes in 869 , forming part of the Danelaw . It was conquered by Edward the Elder and incorporated into the Kingdom of England in 918 . 
 = = History = = 
 The Kingdom of East Anglia was organized in the first or second quarter of the 6th century with Wehha listed as the first king of the East Angles , followed by Wuffa . 
 Until 749 the kings of East Anglia were Wuffingas , named after the semi @-@ historical Wuffa . During the early seventh century , under Rædwald of East Anglia , it was a powerful Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdom . Rædwald , the first of the East Anglian kings to be baptised as a Christian , is considered by many experts to be the person who was buried within ( or commemorated by ) the ship burial at Sutton Hoo , near Woodbridge . During the decades that followed his death in around 624 , East Anglia became increasingly dominated by the powerful kingdom of Mercia . Several of Rædwald 's successors were killed in battle , such as Sigeberht ( killed circa 641 ) . Under Sigeberht 's rule and the guidance of his bishop , Felix of Burgundy , Christianity was firmly established in East Anglia . 
 After Æthelberht II was killed by the Mercians in 794 , and until 825 , East Anglia ceased to be an independent kingdom , although it briefly reasserted its independence under Eadwald in 796 . It survived until 869 , when the Vikings defeated the East Anglians in battle and their king , Edmund the Martyr , was killed . After 879 , the Vikings settled permanently in East Anglia . In 903 the exiled Æthelwold ætheling induced the East Anglian Danes to wage a disastrous war on his cousin Edward the Elder . By 917 , after a succession of Danish defeats , East Anglia had submitted to Edward and was incorporated into the kingdom of England , afterwards becoming an earldom . 
 = = = Settlement = = = 
 East Anglia was settled by the Anglo @-@ Saxons as early as around 450 , earlier than many other regions . It emerged from the settlement and political consolidation of Angles in the approximate area of the former territory of the Iceni and the Roman civitas with its centre at Venta Icenorum , close to Caistor St Edmund . According to Bede , the East Angles ( as well as the Middle Angles , the Mercians and the Northumbrians ) were descended from natives of Angeln ( now in modern Germany ) . The first reference to the East Angles is from around 704 – 713 , in the Whitby Life of St Gregory . 
 The East Angles formed one of the seven kingdoms known to post @-@ mediaeval historians as the Heptarchy , a scheme used by Henry of Huntingdon in the twelfth century . Some modern historians have questioned whether seven independent kingdoms ever really existed contemporaneously , and claim that the political situation was much more complicated . 
 = = = Pagan rule = = = 
 The East Angles were initially ruled by the pagan Wuffingas dynasty , apparently named after an early king , Wuffa , although his name could have been an invention to explain the dynastic name , which means ' descendants of the wolf ' . An indispensable main source of information on the early history of the kingdom and its rulers is Bede 's Ecclesiastical History , but he provided few facts relating to the chronology of the East Anglian kings or the length of their reigns . Nothing is known of the earliest kings of East Anglia , or how the kingdom was organised , although a possible indication of the original centre of royal power is the concentration of ship @-@ burials at Snape and Sutton Hoo in eastern Suffolk . The " North Folk " and " South Folk " may have existed before the arrival of the first East Anglian kings . 
 The most powerful of the Wuffingas kings was Rædwald , ' the son of Tytil , whose father was Wuffa ' , according to the Ecclesiastical History . For a brief period in the early seventh century , whilst Rædwald ruled , East Anglia was among the most powerful kingdoms in Anglo @-@ Saxon England : Rædwald was described by Bede as the overlord of the kingdoms south of the Humber . In 616 , he had been strong enough to defeat and kill the Northumbrian king Æthelfrith at the Battle of the River Idle and enthrone Edwin of Northumbria . He was probably the individual honoured by the sumptuous ship burial at Sutton Hoo . It has been suggested by Blair , on the strength of the parallels between some of the objects found under Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo and those discovered at Vendel in Sweden , that the Wuffingas may have been the descendants of an eastern Swedish royal family . However , as those items previously thought to have come from Sweden are now believed to have been made in England , it seems less likely that the Wuffingas were of Swedish origin . 
 = = = Christianization = = = 
 During the seventh century , Anglo @-@ Saxon Christianity was successfully established . The extent to which paganism was displaced in East Anglia is exemplified by a lack of any East Anglian settlements that are named after the old gods . 
 Rædwald was the first East Anglian king to be baptised , in 604 . He maintained a Christian altar , but at the same time continued to worship pagan gods . From 616 , when pagan monarchs briefly returned in Kent and Essex , until Rædwald 's death , East Anglia was the only Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdom with a reigning baptised king . On his death in around 624 , he was succeeded by his son Eorpwald , who was soon afterwards converted from paganism as a result of the influence of Edwin , but his new religion was evidently opposed in East Anglia and Eorpwald met his death at the hands of a pagan , Ricberht . After three years of apostasy , Christianity prevailed with the accession of Eorpwald 's brother ( or step @-@ brother ) Sigeberht , who had been baptised during his exile in Francia . Sigeberht oversaw the establishment of the first East Anglian see for Felix of Burgundy at Dommoc , probably at Dunwich . He later abdicated in favour of his brother Ecgric and retired to a monastery . 
 = = = Mercian aggression = = = 
 The eminence achieved by East Anglia under Rædwald did not last long , as his dynasty fell victim to the rising power of Penda of Mercia and his successors . Throughout the mid @-@ seventh to early ninth centuries , Mercian power grew until a vast region from the River Thames to the Humber , including East Anglia and the south @-@ east , became a zone of Mercian hegemony . In the early 640s Penda defeated and killed both Ecgric and Sigeberht , who was later venerated as a saint . Ecgric 's successor Anna and Anna 's son Jurmin were killed together in 654 at the Battle of Bulcamp , near Blythburgh . Having eliminated Anna 's challenge to his rising power , Penda then subjected the East Anglians to Mercian overlord @-@ ship . In 655 Æthelhere of East Anglia joined Penda in a campaign against Oswiu , which ended in a disastrous Mercian defeat at the Battle of the Winwaed , in which both Penda and his ally Æthelhere were killed . 
 The last Wuffingas king was Ælfwald , who died in 749 . During the late 7th and 8th centuries East Anglia continued to be overshadowed by Mercian hegemony until , in 794 , Offa of Mercia had the East Anglian king Æthelberht executed and then took control of the kingdom for himself . A brief revival of East Anglian independence under Eadwald after Offa 's death in 796 was soon suppressed by the new Mercian king , Coenwulf . 
 The independence of the East Anglians was restored by a successful rebellion against Mercia led by Æthelstan in 825 . Beornwulf of Mercia 's attempt to restore Mercian control over East Anglia resulted in his defeat and death , and his successor Ludeca met the same end in 827 . The East Angles appealed to Egbert of Wessex for protection against the Mercians and Æthelstan then acknowledged Egbert as his overlord . Whilst Wessex took control of the south @-@ eastern kingdoms which had been absorbed by Mercia during the eighth century , East Anglia could maintain its independence . 
 = = = Viking attacks and eventual settlement = = = 
 In 865 , East Anglia was invaded by the Danish Great Heathen Army , which occupied winter quarters and secured horses before departing for Northumbria . The Danes returned to East Anglia in 869 , wintering at Thetford before being attacked by the forces of Edmund of East Anglia , who was defeated and killed at <unk> ( identified variously as Bradfield St Clare in 983 , which is near to his final resting place at Bury St Edmunds ; <unk> in Norfolk ( documented as <unk> <unk> ) ; Hoxne in Suffolk ; and now with Maldon in Essex ) . From this point onwards , East Anglia effectively ceased to be an independent kingdom . Having defeated the East Angles , the Danes then installed puppet @-@ kings to govern on their behalf , while they resumed their campaigns against Mercia and Wessex . In 878 the last portion of the Great Heathen Army to remain active was defeated by Alfred the Great and withdrew from Wessex after making a peace treaty . In 880 the Vikings returned to East Anglia under the leadership of Guthrum , who , according to the mediaeval historian Pauline Stafford , " swiftly adapted to territorial kingship and its trappings , including the minting of coins " . 
 In addition to the traditional territory of East Anglia , Cambridgeshire and parts of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire , Guthrum 's kingdom probably included Essex , the only portion of Wessex which had come under Danish control . A peace treaty made between Alfred and Guthrum sometime in the 880s . 
 = = = Absorption into the Kingdom of England = = = 
 In the early tenth century , the East Anglian Danes came under increasing pressure from Edward the Elder , king of Wessex . In 902 Edward 's cousin Æthelwold ætheling , who had been driven into exile after an unsuccessful bid for the throne , arrived in Essex after a stay in Northumbria . He was apparently accepted as king by some or all of the Danes in England and in 903 he induced the East Anglian Danes to wage war on Edward . This ended in disaster , with the death of Æthelwold and of Eohric of East Anglia in a battle in the Fens . 
 Between 911 and 919 , Edward expanded his control over the rest of England south of the Humber , establishing in Essex and Mercia burhs , often designed to control the use of a river by the Danes . In 917 , the Danish position in the area suddenly collapsed . A rapid succession of defeats culminated in the loss of the territories of Northampton and Huntingdon , along with the remainder of Essex : a Danish king , probably from East Anglia , was killed at <unk> . Despite reinforcement from overseas , the Danish counter @-@ attacks were crushed , and following the defection of many of their English subjects as Edward 's army advanced , the Danes of East Anglia and Cambridge both capitulated . 
 The territory of East Anglia was absorbed into the kingdom of England . Norfolk and Suffolk became part of the new earldom of East Anglia , when in 1017 , Thorkell the Tall was made earl of East Anglia by Cnut the Great . The restoration of the ecclesiastical structure in the region saw the two former East Anglian bishoprics replaced by a single one based at North Elmham . 
 = = Old East Anglian dialect = = 
 The East Angles spoke Old English . Their language is historically important , as they were among the first Germanic settlers to arrive in Britain during the fifth century : according to <unk> and Schneider , East Anglia " can seriously claim to be the first place in the world where English was spoken " . 
 The evidence for dialects in Old English comes from the study of texts , place @-@ names , personal names and coins . A. H. Smith was the first to recognise the existence of a separate Old East Anglian dialect , in addition to the previously recognised dialects of Northumbrian , Mercian , Saxon and Kentish . He acknowledged that his proposal of such a dialect was tentative , acknowledging that " the linguistic boundaries of the original dialects could not have enjoyed prolonged stability " . As no East Anglian manuscripts , Old English inscriptions or literary records such as charters have survived to modern times , there is little evidence to support the existence of an Old East Anglian dialect . According to a study made by Von <unk> in the 1930s , the recording of many place @-@ names in Domesday Book was " ultimately based on the evidence of local juries " and so the spoken form of Anglo @-@ Saxon places and people was partly preserved in this way . Evidence from Domesday Book and later sources does suggest that a dialect boundary once existed , corresponding with a line that separates from their neighbours the English counties of Cambridgeshire ( including the once sparsely @-@ inhabited Fens ) , Norfolk and Suffolk . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The kingdom of the East Angles bordered the North Sea to the north and the east , with the River Stour historically dividing it from the East Saxons to the south . The North Sea provided a " thriving maritime link to Scandinavia and the northern reaches of Germany " , according to the historian Richard Hoggett . The kingdom 's western boundary varied from the rivers Ouse , Lark and Kennett to further westwards , as far as the Cam in what is now Cambridgeshire . At its greatest extent , the kingdom comprised the modern @-@ day counties of Norfolk , Suffolk and parts of eastern Cambridgeshire . 
 Erosion along the eastern border and deposition along the north coast altered the shape of the East Anglian coastline during Roman and Anglo @-@ Saxon times ( and continues to do so today ) . During Saxon times the sea inundated the naturally low @-@ lying Fens . As sea levels fell alluvium was deposited near major river estuaries and the ' Great Estuary ' near Burgh Castle became slowed closed off by a large spit . 
 = Nuclear Strike = 
 Nuclear Strike is a shooter video game developed and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation in 1997 . The game is the sequel to Soviet Strike and the fifth instalment in the Strike series , which began with Desert Strike on the Sega Genesis . The Soviet Strike development team also created Nuclear Strike . EA released a PC port the same year ; THQ developed and in 1999 published a Nintendo 64 version called Nuclear Strike 64 . 
 Nuclear Strike is a helicopter @-@ based game , with strategy elements added to the action gameplay . The plot concerns an elite special force - the player 's allies - pursuing a nuclear @-@ armed rogue spy through a fictionalised Asian setting . It retained the earlier game 's engine but added several modifications to improve graphical performance and make the game more accessible . The game features 15 playable vehicles , a large increase from previous games . In addition to the main fictionalised Apache , there are secondary helicopters , jets , armour and a hovercraft . The player also commands ground troops in occasional real @-@ time strategy sections . 
 The game received positive , negative and mixed reviews . Critics noted a weak storyline , though GameSpot dismissed this is as unimportant in an action game . GameSpot called the graphics - which made use of specialised hardware such as 3Dfx Voodoo video cards and the N64 Expansion Pak - " about as good as it gets " , while Allgame said they are " decent " and Daily Radar called them " horrible " . Critics praised the full motion video as well as the music and sound effects . Reviewers enjoyed the straightforward gameplay but several complained of a close similarity to its predecessor Soviet Strike and questioned the game 's value as a result . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game begins in Indocine , a fictional Southeast Asian country . The player controls a Super Apache helicopter as part of the STRIKE covert operations force , led by General Earle ( John <unk> ) and assisted by technician Hack ( <unk> Tanner ) and propagandist Andrea Gray ( Susan Turner @-@ Cray ) . The antagonist is Colonel LeMonde ( Bo Hopkins ) , a spy @-@ turned @-@ warlord who has stolen a nuclear weapon . Allied to STRIKE in Indocine is guerrilla leader Naja Hana ( Moon Bloodgood ) , whose forces join the player in attacking LeMonde 's forces . Meanwhile , LeMonde bluffs STRIKE by arming a fake nuclear bomb in an old temple compound , which results in Naja attempting to locate the warhead and LeMonde . At the same time , the player is sent on a wild goose chase attacking a decoy convoy thought to have the nuclear bomb being transported away from Indocine . In actuality , LeMonde escapes capture long before STRIKE could catch up to him and he managed to smuggle the real nuclear bomb away from Indocine off @-@ screen . This prompts the player to extract Naja from the now booby @-@ trapped compound before the whole compound blew up sky high . Nonetheless , his forces are eventually defeated in Indocine and STRIKE conducts their operations in the South China Sea , where LeMonde is discovered dealing with Napoleon Hwong ( Philip Tan ) , head of a fictional Triad @-@ like criminal organization known as the <unk> . The player recruits mercenary Harding Cash ( Jamie Donovan ) in battling the pirate warlord in an attempt to recover the missing nuclear weapon . After defeating Hwong 's forces , the player and Harding manage to capture and interrogate Hwong for information concerning the whereabouts of the nuke long enough before Hwong commits suicide . The player eventually heads to Pyongyang , North Korea , where the stolen nuke is located . 
 LeMonde resurfaces in Pyongyang , where North Korean ruler Kym <unk> @-@ Lee invites several world leaders to a peace conference . The two plan to kidnap the world leaders , especially since Kim financed LeMonde 's operations in Indocine and getting the nuclear weapon ( stashed inside Kim Il @-@ sung 's statue on <unk> Hill ) . Using a small helicopter and nonlethal weapons , the player is able to spirit the delegates to a French frigate somewhere in the Taedong River and get them out of the country ; other delegates left behind are sent to bomb shelters or are evacuated by STRIKE Chinook transports . Also , between escorting the delegates to safety , the player and Andrea manage to take over an AH @-@ 1 Cobra attack helicopter from a museum while fending off Kym 's security forces in the process . The missing nuclear weapon explodes as the player sits out the blast in the <unk> May Day Stadium . 
 North Korea blames the nuclear explosion on the South and sends its forces across the DMZ in an attempt to start a second Korean War while LeMonde heads to Russia . STRIKE heads down to the DMZ and assists US Forces Korea and the South Korean Army in repelling the assault . Having prevented another Korean War , STRIKE , together with Naja and Cash , attack an old Mongol @-@ era fortress in Siberia , where LeMonde has brought in mercenaries to fortify it as he prepares the launch of a " proto @-@ nuclear " missile designed to rupture the ozone layer . LeMonde 's forces are eventually routed , the proto @-@ nuclear missile eventually destroyed , and LeMonde himself is killed in an airstrike sponsored by STRIKE . Naja and Cash fall in love , while STRIKE prepares to deploy to another crisis zone . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Nuclear Strike is a helicopter @-@ based shooter game with a blend of both strategy and action , which the player views from outside the helicopter from an overhead perspective . It is similar to previous games in the series , but has 15 playable vehicles , a larger number than any of its predecessors . The main helicopter is a fictional Super Apache , with additional helicopters including the Cobra and other Hueys . Playable jets include the Harrier Jump Jet and a fictional V / STOL version of the A @-@ 10 Thunderbolt II . The player can use surface vehicles including the M1 Abrams tank , Bradley armoured vehicle , the Multiple Launch Rocket System and a <unk> hovercraft . 
 The game features five different terrain settings with each level being played on a large map divided into several missions . These missions include seek @-@ and @-@ destroy , search @-@ and @-@ rescue , escorts , the destruction of bridges , supply drops and air support . In some sections the player forms part of a coordinated attack with AI @-@ controlled allies , while in others the player directs ground troops in the style of a real @-@ time strategy game . As well as engaging in combat , the player must monitor and replenish his fuel and ammunition supplies . The heads @-@ up display shows this information , along with intelligence on missions objectives and on friendly and enemy units and their locations . The compass indicating mission objectives is a feature new to Nuclear Strike , as is a radar showing the positions of nearby enemies . 
 = = Development = = 
 The game is the second 32 @-@ bit Strike game : the sequel to Soviet Strike and the fifth installment in the Strike series , which began with Desert Strike on the Sega Genesis . It was developed at Electronic Arts ' Granite Bay Software , by a 50 strong team led by producer Michael <unk> and including the " same core group " - designers , programmers , artists and composers - as developed Soviet Strike . Series creator Mike Posehn received royalties for Nuclear Strike but did not work on programming the game . The game retained Soviet Strike 's engine , with several modifications . The development team increased the frame rate by 25 % over its predecessor , resulting in a " faster and smoother " feel . The game streams the environment from its CD , resulting in " no perceptible loading time " , while the terrain itself is persistent : damage such as cratering remains for the duration of play . The team improved the artificial intelligence and added more camera angles , though the game like its predecessors still eschews any in @-@ cockpit perspective . 
 Soviet Strike received criticism regarding the player 's limited view of his surroundings and attacks from enemies out with it . To offset this potential problem , the developers added a radar to the HUD , which illustrated surrounding enemies to the player . Gamers also criticized the difficulty of Soviet Strike . A high difficulty level being traditional to the Strike series , the team did not wish to alienate long @-@ term fans by making Nuclear Strike directly easier , but instead more accessible , using such devices as the new radar , a new compass indicating the direction of the next objective and " a lot more visual and audible clues " . Producer <unk> explained : " A lot of the stuff we couldn 't fit in [ Soviet Strike ] is going in this one " . The team added several new vehicles , as well as continuing the occasional real time strategy sections found in Soviet Strike . The jets proved problematic in early testing due to their speed , but appeared in the final game . Heat @-@ seeking missiles were among other new additions , as was a proprietary technology termed the Interactive Music System . This generates more " pulse pounding " music depending on the level of action occurring in @-@ game . Palomar Studios created the full motion video , for which some footage was shot in both Thailand and the Bronson Cave , used as the Batcave in the 1960s television incarnation of Batman . This latter shoot also employed a live tiger . 
 Initially only the PlayStation version and a PC port were planned , but the game appeared on the Nintendo 64 in 1999 as Nuclear Strike 64 . The PC port was developed by EA Tiburon , with both the PlayStation original and PC published by Electronic Arts in 1997 . Nuclear Strike 64 was developed by Pacific Coast Power & Light and published by THQ . Another sequel provisionally titled Future Strike was later planned , but the game was eventually released as Future Cop : LAPD , a mech @-@ based shooter game .

 Daily Radar found the story lacking , while GameSpot 's Shane Mooney defended it thus : " people moan about a lack of a compelling story in action titles , which makes about as much sense as complaining about the lack of a <unk> in a football sim [ ... ] People couldn 't care less if the story was written by Steinbeck or <unk> the Hack , as long as they get to see THX @-@ rattling fireballs and bad guys bleeding from every orifice . " 
 IGN noted improved graphics , which it favourably compared to those of a John Woo film . GameSpot called the graphics as " about as good as it gets " , particularly with a 3D video card . The New Straits Times also appreciated the game 's performance with a 3Dfx Voodoo card , praising the graphics of the terrain , as well as water and helicopter movements . GameFan acclaimed the attention to detail and variety in environment graphics ' textures . Reviewing the PC version , Allgame called the graphics " decent " , but criticised the minimal progress from Soviet Strike which resulted in " a slightly archaic look " and lack of " a feel of individuality " . Reviewing Nuclear Strike 64 , the website noted that the graphics ably handled numerous explosions and enemies . The reviewer praised the detail , colours and fluid motion . He also acknowledged the use of N64 Expansion Pak , but said " the game still moves and looks very nice " without it . Game Revolution felt : " This is definitely the best @-@ looking ' Strike ' game yet . " It praised the " gorgeously rendered " maps and the detail on structures and units , while Next Generation complained of " water that doesn 't ripple and a few other missing touches " resulting in a somewhat haphazard feel . Daily Radar praised the terrain graphics but called the vehicles " horrible " . Power Play praised the impressive graphics and destructible scenery . Game Revolution also praised the persistent battlefields : " What really stands out is the ability to interact with everything . When you shoot water , you see and hear the splashes . You can blow up almost anything that they 've put on the map " but noted the sometimes unrealistic results , such as ships being launched high into the air upon destruction . Edge called said the terrain graphics were " some of the best yet on the PlayStation " , but there were otherwise no ground @-@ breaking visuals . 
 GameFan praised the " super stylish " full motion video . Allgame felt the game to be worth playing for the FMV alone , calling it the " best aspect of the game " and " an awesome video presentation that , combined with a number of high quality voice @-@ acting jobs , does a great job of conferring the intensity and danger of the nuclear dilemma at hand . " Game Revolution noted the strong production values of most of the FMV and while a minority had " back yard " production , they nevertheless used quality actors and " fairly impressed " the reviewer , though he criticised the " MTV @-@ like editing " . Edge also noted the " MTV @-@ style presentation " and called it " stylish " and atmospheric . Reviewing Nuclear Strike 64 , Allgame praised the atmospheric music as " reminiscent of a large budget political spy thriller " . The reviewer said : " what really cranks up the adrenaline and ramps up the immersion factor in the game is the great sound effects . " 
 Allgame said the enjoyment " isn 't bad " , but limited : " You can only blow up so much stuff with a helicopter . " Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre , but reviewing the PC version , Shane Mooney wrote : " I 'm happy to say that the much @-@ maligned action @-@ heavy , plot @-@ light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike . " Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would " find plenty to <unk> over in this extremely entertaining title . " Daily Radar said : " When it comes to creating an action game , it would be nice to play something that requires a little bit more than just holding down the fire button continuously . In Nuclear Strike 64 , that 's just about all you do . " The website said : " if all you 're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter , drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest , well , here you go . " Allgame summarised : " When all is said and done , Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game . " The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game 's longevity and variety . Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good , but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system . The website acclaimed the " perfect " difficulty level . GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player 's vehicle while not visible on @-@ screen . GameSpot 's minor complaints were infrequent game saves , a " too easy " structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces , a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer . 
 Allgame felt Nuclear Strike " is really nothing more than a repackaged version of the earlier game " . The reviewer felt there to be limited motivation for owners of Soviet Strike to buy the new sequel other than the FMV . GameFan called Nuclear Strike " a tangible improvement over its predecessor " and " a more satisfying experience all round . " The writer felt the increased number of vehicles set the game apart from Soviet Strike , saying they " make for a far richer , more active playing experience . " He recommended it to Soviet Strike devotees , while Power Play recommended it for fans of action games . IGN wrote the game was a " fine example " of the series , also citing a broader range of vehicles over Soviet Strike . Nonetheless it gave Nuclear Strike a lower score than the game 's predecessor , saying " at its heart Nuclear Strike is the same game as Soviet Strike [ ... ] It 's not a bad game , it 's just more of the same . " GameFan 's reviewers called Nuclear Strike " the definitive strike game " and said it " <unk> all other Strikes that have come before . " Previewing the PlayStation version , Super GamePower predicted the improved explosion effects , missions and wider range of vehicles would make it the best in the series . In its review , the magazine said the game contained nothing new for fans of the previous games , but felt the control system , explosions , helicopter sound effects to be excellent . Next Generation said : " Those who enjoyed Soviet Strike are certain to like Nuclear Strike even more " , but said the games are almost indistinguishable . Game Revolution acknowledged the game is " basically the same rehash of its predecessors , but it stands as a great game on its own . Nuclear Strike is a definite buy for fans who haven 't tired of the series , and at least a ' rent me ' for those who have been locked in the closet and haven 't played any ' Strike ' games . " Edge said : " Fans of the series lusting after more above @-@ viewed shooting action will naturally welcome this latest regurgitation . The seasoned gamer , however , will no doubt walk away with a feeling of <unk> vu . " 
 = HMS Aldenham ( L22 ) = 
 HMS Aldenham ( pennant number L22 ) was an escort destroyer of the Type III Hunt @-@ class . The Royal Navy ordered its construction in July 1940 . Upon completion in February 1942 , she was deployed to convoy escort duty . Aldenham is one of the ships credited with the sinking of the U @-@ 587 on 27 March 1942 . After circumnavigating Africa , she joined the Mediterranean Fleet , escorting convoys between Alexandria , Malta and Tobruk . She took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily , landings at Salerno and Anzio , the Dodecanese Campaign and Operation Dragoon before being assigned to the Adriatic Campaign . 
 On 14 December 1944 , Aldenham was sunk by a naval mine in the Adriatic Sea off Pag Island after she led a Royal Navy force in a bombardment mission against targets on the island of Pag and near the town of Karlobag in support of the Yugoslav Partisans . Although the rest of the force came to pick up survivors , cold weather and severe damage to Aldenham permitted the rescue of only 63 of her crew . Her wreck , broken in two by the explosion , was discovered in 1999 – 2000 . It is a war grave , where 126 crew members and two Yugoslav Partisans aboard Aldenham at the time of the mining died . She was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II .

Aldenham had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 015 tonnes ( 999 long tons ; 1 @,@ 119 short tons ) , and a full load of 1 @,@ 490 to 1 @,@ 545 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 466 to 1 @,@ 521 long tons ; 1 @,@ 642 to 1 @,@ 703 short tons ) . Her two Parsons geared steam turbines drove two propeller shaft . Steam was supplied by two Admiralty three @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . The turbines were rated at 13 @,@ 970 kilowatts ( 18 @,@ 730 shp ) and gave Aldenham a speed of 28 @.@ 3 knots ( 52 @.@ 4 km / h ; 32 @.@ 6 mph ) during sea trials , but she achieved up to 27 knots ( 50 kilometres per hour ; 31 miles per hour ) on deployments . 
 Aldenham was armed with four quick @-@ firing four @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) Mk XVI naval guns on twin mounts , four anti @-@ aircraft 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) QF 2 pounder naval guns and three Oerlikon 20 mm cannons . She also had two 21 @-@ inch ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes , and 70 – 100 depth charges deployed by four throwers and two chutes . 
 The ship was ordered on 4 July 1940 . She was laid down by Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead on 22 August 1940 as construction project J <unk> . Aldenham was launched on 27 August 1941 and completed on 5 February 1942 . 
 = = Service = = 
 Aldenham and its crew of 170 completed brief training at Scapa Flow before deploying for the first time on 21 March 1942 , as a part of an Escort Group assigned to the WS 17 convoy sailing to the Cape of Good Hope . On 27 March , Aldenham , together with Leamington , Grove and Volunteer , sank U @-@ 587 in the North Atlantic , due west of Ushant , France . Aldenham was commanded by Lieutenant Alex Stuart @-@ Menteth . 
 <unk> Africa and transiting the Suez Canal accompanied by Grove , Aldenham joined the 5th Destroyer Flotilla in the Battle of the Mediterranean . She escorted 14 convoys there , protecting shipping between Alexandria , Malta and Tobruk . On 29 August 1942 , she was assigned coastal bombardment duties , including the area of El Daba . Sources disagree which ships took part in the bombardment of El Daba itself . According to Jürgen Rohwer , Aldenham and Eridge were the only ships involved , while Paul Kemp places Eridge at the scene supported by fellow destroyers Croome and Hursley . Aldenham towed Eridge back to Alexandria after the latter ship was disabled by an Italian <unk> motor torpedo boat during the bombardment . 
 Aldenham was a part of an allied blockade off Cap Bon in May 1943 and escorted landing craft during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July and the Salerno landings in September that year . She assisted Eskimo removing wounded when Eskimo was attacked and hit by the Luftwaffe on 15 July . Aldenham also took part in failed Dodecanese Campaign of 1944 , when she sustained minor damage in an aircraft attack . After repairs in Alexandria , Aldenham saw action in Operation Shingle off Anzio , Italy , and escorted convoys between Oran , Algeria and Naples . She was based in Taranto in May , and transferred to Bari in June , before supporting Operation Dragoon , protecting landing craft off southern France . Afterwards , she sailed again to the Adriatic Sea , joining a Royal Navy flotilla fighting the Adriatic Campaign . 
 The Royal Navy Adriatic flotilla consisted of Aldenham , Atherstone , Avon Vale , <unk> , Lauderdale , Wheatland , Wilton , Brocklesby and Quantock . In late November 1944 , the flotilla , led by Aldenham under Commander James Gerald Farrant , intercepted and captured German hospital ship Bonn ( ex @-@ Yugoslav steamship Šumadija ) . She and Atherstone bombarded German units deployed to the island of Rab on 9 December . The bombardment was in support of Yugoslav Partisans advance north along the eastern coast of the Adriatic , capturing the coast and islands from retreating German forces . 
 What became Aldenham 's final deployment began on 14 December 1944 , when she and Atherstone sortied from a Royal Navy base at Ist Island and anchored off the western coast of Pag Island , north of Zadar , to bombard an artillery battery near Karlobag and other military targets on Pag . Because of poor visibility , the artillery observers on Pag directed destroyers to strike the Pag Island objectives first . Each destroyer fired 500 four @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) shells against bunkers and barracks on the island between 09 : 00 and 11 : 20 . The town of Pag itself was targeted by the destroyers for an hour at 14 : 00 , while Aldenham alone engaged the battery at Karlobag at approximately 13 : 00 and again before 15 : 00 as visibility improved , firing 200 shells against that target . At 15 : 00 , the destroyers started their return to Ist with Aldenham in the lead and Atherstone following her at 20 knots ( 37 kilometres per hour ; 23 miles per hour ) .

 As Aldenham was making a turn at a position north of the islet of Škrda , to sail between islands of <unk> and Olib , she hit a mine that exploded under her engine room . The ship broke in two and her bow sank quickly , followed by her stern a little later , at 15 : 29 . Cold weather hampered rescue efforts by Atherton and accompanying motor launches ML 238 and <unk> 1162 , and only 58 seamen and five officers , including Farrant , were pulled out of the sea . 126 crewmen died , as well as a wounded Yugoslav Partisan transported from Pag for medical treatment and Yugoslav Partisan liaison officer , Colonel Ivan <unk> . Aldenham was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II . 
 A portion of the surviving crew revisited the site on 14 December 1984 , but the shipwreck was not located until 15 years later . In 1999 , Italian wreck divers located a 30 @-@ metre ( 98 ft ) long bow section one nautical mile ( 1 @.@ 9 kilometres ) off Škrda . It lies on the port side , at a depth of 86 metres ( 282 feet ) , but it is normally obscured by silt stirred up by trawling further north in the Kvarner Gulf . The aft section of the ship was discovered in 2000 through testimony of a fisherman from Pag . It was found closer to Škrda , approximately 700 metres ( 2 @,@ 300 feet ) away from the bow section . Aldenham 's boilers and propellers were still operating as the ship sank , and the section struck the silty seafloor at a depth of 82 metres ( 269 feet ) , with her keel on top . Her rudder is now at a depth of 67 metres ( 220 feet ) . The wreck was declared a British war grave , and forms a part of " the Ghost Fleet of Pag " together with wrecks of Kriegsmarine destroyer TA 20 ( ex @-@ Italian Audace ) , corvettes UJ 202 and UJ 208 ( ex @-@ Italian <unk> and <unk> ) sunk in the Action of 1 November 1944 , and World War I wrecks of Austro @-@ Hungarian steamships SS <unk> and SS Euterpe .

 Albert William Ketèlbey ( / <unk> / ; born <unk> ; 9 August 1875 – 26 November 1959 ) , was an English composer , conductor , and pianist , best known for his short pieces of light orchestral music . He was born in Birmingham , and moved to London in 1889 to study at Trinity College of Music . After a brilliant studentship he did not pursue the classical career predicted for him , becoming musical director of the Vaudeville Theatre before gaining fame as a composer of light music and as a conductor of his own works . 
 For many years Ketèlbey worked for a series of music publishers , including Chappell & Co and the Columbia Graphophone Company , making arrangements for smaller orchestras , a period in which he learned to write fluent and popular music . He also found great success writing music for silent films until the advent of talking films in the late 1920s . 
 The composer 's early works in conventional classical style were well received , but it was for his light orchestral pieces that he became best known . One of his earliest works in the genre , In a Monastery Garden ( 1915 ) , sold over a million copies and brought him to widespread notice ; his later musical depictions of exotic scenes caught the public imagination and established his fortune . Such works as In a Persian Market ( 1920 ) , In a Chinese Temple Garden ( 1923 ) , and In the Mystic Land of Egypt ( 1931 ) became best @-@ sellers in print and on records ; by the late 1920s he was Britain 's first millionaire composer . His celebrations of British scenes were equally popular : examples include Cockney Suite ( 1924 ) with its scenes of London life , and his ceremonial music for royal events . His works were frequently recorded during his heyday , and a substantial part of his output has been put on CD in more recent years . 
 Ketèlbey 's popularity began to wane during the Second World War and his originality also declined ; many of his post @-@ war works were re @-@ workings of older pieces and he increasingly found his music ignored by the BBC . In 1949 he moved to the Isle of Wight , where he spent his retirement , and he died at home in obscurity . His work has been reappraised since his death ; in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme Your Hundred Best Tunes , Bells across the Meadows was voted thirty @-@ sixth most popular tune of all time and the last night of the 2009 Proms season marked the fiftieth anniversary of Ketèlbey 's death — the first time his music had been included in the festival 's finale .

 = = = Early life and education , 1875 – 95 = = = 
 Albert William Ketèlbey was born on 9 August 1875 at 41 Alma Street in the Aston area of Birmingham , England . He was the second of five children of George Henry , a jewellery engraver , and his wife Sarah Ann , née Aston . The grave accent was Albert 's invention : the family name was spelled without it at the time of his birth and there had been several variants of the name in the previous generations . All the children were taught a musical instrument and Ketèlbey 's brother , Harold , was later a violinist of note . Albert showed a natural talent for the piano and singing , and he subsequently became head chorister at St Silas ' Church in nearby <unk> . 
 At the age of eleven Ketèlbey joined the Birmingham and Midland Institute school of music ( now the Birmingham Conservatoire ) where he was tutored by Dr Alfred Gaul in composition and Dr H.W. Wareing in harmony . At the age of thirteen Ketèlbey composed his first serious piece of music , " Sonata for Pianoforte " , which , for Tom McCanna , his biographer , " shows a precocious mastery of composition " . Ketèlbey competed for a scholarship to Trinity College of Music in London , and received the highest marks of all entrants ; the future composer Gustav Holst came second . Ketèlbey entered the college in 1889 , studying under G.E. Bambridge ( piano ) , Dr G. Saunders ( harmony ) and Frederick Corder ( composition ) . 
 In 1892 Ketèlbey again won the annual scholarship competition and was appointed as the organist at St John 's Church , Wimbledon , London . He held the post for the next five years , during which time he wrote several anthems and hymns , the latter of which included " Every Good Gift " , " Behold ! Upon the Mountains " and " Be Strong ! All ye People " . It was around this time he added the accent to his surname , with the aim of moving the stress onto the second syllable , rather than the first . In that year he appeared in a series of concerts in London and provincial cities . In March 1892 at the capital 's Queen 's Hall he played Frédéric Chopin 's Scherzo No. 2 in B @-@ flat minor ; the reviewer for The Illustrated London News thought the " brilliant " Ketèlbey played " most beautifully " . He won several prizes at the college before being awarded his certificate in 1895 . During this period , The British Musician reports , some critics found likenesses between Ketèlbey 's music and that of Edward German . 
 Towards the end of his time at the college Ketèlbey wrote lighter , mostly mandolin based , compositions . As he still aspired to be a serious composer , he adapted the pseudonym Raoul Clifford in an effort to distanced himself from the genre . On leaving the college he became one of its examiners in harmony . He wrote piano pieces as part of his role , and used the pseudonym Anton <unk> for the work ; he subsequently used the name for more serious works , which he published with French titles . 
 = = = Early career , 1896 – 1914 = = = 
 In 1896 Ketèlbey took up the post of conductor for a travelling light opera company ; his father , who wanted his son to be a composer of serious music , disapproved of what he saw as a lightweight role . After a two @-@ year tour Ketèlbey was appointed as musical director of the Opera Comique Theatre — at age 22 , the youngest theatrical conductor in London at the time . He moved into a house in Bruton Street , in London 's Mayfair , where he wrote the song " Blow ! Blow ! Thou Winter Wind " , to words from Shakespeare 's As You Like It . The Opera Comique staged a successful revival of the musical Alice in Wonderland between December 1898 and March 1899 , and according to his biographer John Sant , it is possible that Ketèlbey wrote some of the music . This was followed by the comic opera A Good Time from April , for which Ketèlbey wrote the music and songs . Following poor reviews , the short run of the piece ended in May and the Opera Comique closed because of the losses brought about by the production . There , Ketèlbey began a relationship with the actress and singer Charlotte " Lottie " <unk> . The couple married in 1906 but the relationship was childless . 
 Ketèlbey wrote music in the style of the Gilbert and Sullivan works for a comic opera The Wonder Worker , which was staged at the Grand Theatre , Fulham in 1900 . The reviewer for the London Evening Standard thought Ketèlbey 's score was " attractive though conventional ... No originality is shown in conception or treatment , but the conception is appropriate , and the treatment effective . " The same year Ketèlbey began undertaking transcription work at the music publisher A. Hammond & Co , making arrangements of music for smaller orchestras . In 1904 he also began to work for a second music publisher , Chappell & Co , a third in 1907 , the Columbia Graphophone Company , and a fourth in 1910 , when he worked for Elkin & Co . McCanna considers that " this hack @-@ work may have been tedious , but the experience was invaluable in moulding the composer 's fluent writing for both piano and orchestra " . Throughout the time working for the companies he continued to compose and publish his own work , comprising organ music , songs , duets , piano pieces and anthems . He worked for Columbia for over twenty years and rose to the position of Musical Director and Adviser , working with leading musicians across a range of musical styles ; Columbia released more than 600 recordings with Ketèlbey conducting . 
 In 1912 the composer and cellist Auguste van <unk> offered a prize for a new work to complement his popular piece The Broken Melody . Ketèlbey was the winner of the competition with a new composition , The Phantom Melody , which became his first major success . In the following year he won two prizes totalling £ 200 in a competition held by The Evening News : second place with a song for female voices , and first place with his entry for male voices . The latter song , " My Heart Still Clings to You " , is described by Sant as " a typical tragical @-@ love ballad of this time , and its almost Victorian sentimentality comes through in its words " . In the early to mid @-@ 1910s Ketèlbey began to write music for silent films — a new growth industry in Britain from 1910 onwards — and he had great success in the medium until the advent of talking films in the late 1920s . 
 = = = Rising reputation and success , 1914 – 46 = = = 
 In 1914 Ketèlbey wrote the orchestral work In a Monastery Garden , which was published in the following year both as a piano piece and in full orchestral form . It was his first major success , his most famous piece , and became known all over the world ; by 1920 over a million copies of the sheet music had been sold . There are two competing stories detailing the inspiration behind the piece : although Ketèlbey later said that he wrote the work for an old friend , he also stated that he composed it after visiting a monastery . The musicologist Peter Dempsey considers that " this piece ... remains to this day a world @-@ renowned staple of the light @-@ music repertoire , while McCanna opines that from the first bar , listeners " ... might sooner expect such a device in the impassioned world of a [ Gustav ] Mahler symphony than in a genteel English salon piece " . The success of The Phantom Melody and In a Monastery Garden led to Ketèlbey 's engagement by André Charlot as the musical director for the 1916 revue Samples ! at the Vaudeville Theatre . The appointment led to similar positions at other London theatres , including the Adelphi , Garrick , Shaftesbury and Drury Lane theatres . 
 Because of the rise in Ketèlbey 's popularity , and in sales of his sheet music , in 1918 he became a member of the Performing Rights Society . Except for a brief interval in 1926 when he resigned over a dispute about the allocation of funds to its members , he remained a lifelong member . In 1919 he composed the romantic work In the Moonlight , which his publisher considered to be " a work of striking beauty " . In the following year he wrote Wedgwood Blue — a <unk> — and In a Persian Market ; the latter became one of his more popular works . The musicologist Jonathan Bellman , calling In a Persian Market " immortal " , describes it as " an ' intermezzo scene ' for band or small orchestra ; <unk> demeaning or delightfully tacky " . The work was not without its critics ; the composer and conductor Nicolas Slonimsky quotes the view of a Russian journal that " the suite ... had its ' immaculate conception ' in imperialistic colonial England . The composer 's intention is to convince the listener that all 's well in the colonies where beautiful women and exotic fruits mature together , where beggars and rulers are friends , where there are no imperialists , no restive <unk> . " In The Musical Times , the pseudonymous reviewer " Ariel " described the work as " naive and inexpensive pseudo @-@ orientalism " , which led to heated correspondence in the journal over the following months between the composer and the critic . 
 In 1921 Ketèlbey moved from his home in St John 's Wood , where he had been living for the previous seven years , to Frognal , an area of Hampstead , north west London . He installed a billiards table in the basement , which became his favoured form of relaxation . He produced a series of orchestral pieces in the first half of the 1920s , including Bells Across the Meadows released in 1921 , and Suite <unk> ( 1922 ) , which the music critic Tim McDonald considers " impressive " . In the following year Ketèlbey wrote In a Chinese Temple Garden , followed in 1924 by Sanctuary of the Heart and Cockney Suite . The last of these contained the finale " ' Appy ' <unk> " , which the writers Lewis and Susan Foreman describe as " ... a kaleidoscope of passing images , mouth organs , a cornet playing , ... a band , ... shouts of a showman ... with his rattle and a steam engine and roundabout " . 
 In 1923 the composer Frederic Austin wrote the opera Polly , closely based on the 1729 work of the same name by John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch ; recordings of Austin 's work were published by Columbia 's main rival , the Gramophone Company . At Columbia 's request Ketèlbey produced his own version of Gay 's original . Austin considered that it copied elements of his , and sued for copyright infringement . Acting as a court expert witness , the composer Sir Frederick Bridge thought that the case " ... is an awful bore . ... These two good men are good musicians , and they have no business to be fighting over the game . It is not worth the trouble . ... It is rubbish . I am sick of ' Polly ' . " After three weeks the case ended with the judge finding against Columbia . 
 Such was Ketèlbey 's popularity that by 1924 his works could be heard several times a day in restaurants and cinemas , and in that year the Lyons tea shops spent £ 150 @,@ 000 on playing his music in their outlets . He continued to build on his success in 1925 with In a Lovers ' Garden and In the Camp of the Ancient Britons — inspired by a trip he took to Worlebury Camp , near Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare . He undertook annual tours of Britain , conducting his music with municipal orchestras , and also worked with the BBC Wireless Orchestra . He was invited to conduct several international orchestras , and spent time in Belgium , Germany , France , Switzerland and particularly in the Netherlands , where he built a strong relationship with the Concertgebouw and <unk> Grand Symphony orchestras . His music was popular on the continent and his obituarist in The Times later reported that one Viennese critic considered that Ketèlbey 's music was behind only that of Johann Strauss and Franz Lehár . Continental audiences often called him " The English Strauss " . 
 Ketèlbey was financially successful enough to leave Columbia Records in 1926 to spend more time composing , although he continued to conduct for them on an occasional basis , particularly between 1928 and 1930 when he conducted sixteen of his own works with the company , published as Ketèlbey Conducting his Concert Orchestra . He spent his time undertaking annual conducting tours and composing , and in 1927 he published By the Blue Hawaiian Waters and the suite In a Fairy Realm , while in the following year he wrote another suite , Three Fanciful Etchings . His works continued to sell well , and in the October 1929 issue of the Performing Right Gazette his publisher described him as " Britain 's greatest living composer " ; when the advertisement was mentioned in The Musical Times , the anonymous writer wrote " we sympathise with Mr Ketèlbey in being thus raised to a pinnacle which he himself , we are sure , would be very far from claiming . " Sant writes that Ketèlbey subsequently became Britain 's first millionaire composer . In February 1930 he began what became an annual series of concerts at the Kingsway Hall , conducting a new work , The Clock and the Dresden Figures . In a review of the 1933 concert , the critic S.R. Nelson wrote that " as a descriptive writer Ketèlbey really does take some beating . He has the happy knack of combining infinitely melodious themes and the cleverly diluted likeness of the authentic atmosphere . " 
 The introduction of talking films in 1927 with The Jazz Singer and the subsequent growth of the medium had a serious impact on composers and music publishers involved in the film industry as it heralded a decline in the sales of sheet music . Although Ketèlbey 's income from this source declined , the period was also marked by a rise in the popularity of the radio and <unk> and his new compositions were successful with audiences at home . By the early 1930s over 1 @,@ 500 broadcasts of his work were made on BBC Radio in a year , and more than 700 on continental radio stations , including a weekly Sunday programme of his music , sponsored by Decca Records on Radio Luxembourg . For this programme he wrote the theme music , " Sunday Afternoon Reverie " , with the melody based on the musical notes D E C C A. 
 Ketèlbey wrote an intermezzo — A Birthday Greeting — in 1932 , on the sixth birthday of Princess Elizabeth ( later Queen Elizabeth II ) . His connection to royalty continued in 1934 , when his march A State Procession was played to accompany the arrival of King George V at a Royal Command Performance ; the king requested that the march should be played again during the interval , and he and the queen stayed in the royal box to listen to the piece . In the following year Ketèlbey wrote the march With Honour Crowned for the King 's silver jubilee ; the work was played for the royal family at Windsor Castle before Ketèlbey conducted its first public performance at Kingsway Hall . The work was played at that year 's Trooping the Colour and at the Jubilee Thanksgiving Service at St Paul 's Cathedral . 
 Ketèlbey continued to conduct on his annual tours during the Second World War , but these were on a smaller scale because of travel restrictions . He also continued with his annual concerts at Kingsway Hall , and introduced a new march , Fighting for Freedom , which he had written in a supportive response to Winston Churchill 's " We shall fight on the beaches " speech . Apart from composing and conducting , he also acted as a Special Constable during the war .

 The winter of 1946 – 47 was harsh , and in February the sub @-@ zero temperatures burst the water main outside Ketèlbey 's Hampstead home . With his house partially flooded , he lost most of his correspondence , manuscripts and papers and he and his wife both contracted pneumonia . The couple were taken to the Regent 's Park Nursing Home , where Lottie died two days later . He sold his house and moved temporarily to the Hendon Hall Hotel , where he had a nervous breakdown . He spent the remainder of the year staying in hotels in southern England ; in Bournemouth he began a relationship with Mabel Maud Pritchett , a hotel manageress , and the couple married in October in the following year . 
 In 1949 Ketèlbey and his new wife moved to the Isle of Wight , and purchased <unk> , Egypt Hill , in Cowes , where he partly retired , although he still composed occasionally . Tastes in popular music had changed during and after the war and his music declined in popularity ; his income in 1940 had been £ 3 @,@ 493 , which dropped to £ 2 @,@ 906 in 1950 — a particularly steep drop when wartime inflation is considered . McCanna writes that apart from a commission for the National Brass Band competition in 1945 , Ketèlbey produced nothing memorable after the war , and his biographer Keith Anderson considers that in the postwar period Ketèlbey 's work " ... lacked novelty . Of the handful of works published ... most were reworkings of old material , although the composer attempted to disguise the origins " . The BBC also began to ignore his work . In their 1949 Festival of Light Music , none of his compositions were played , which he found distressing . In his letter to the Director @-@ General of the BBC , Sir William Haley , Ketèlbey said the exclusion was " a public insult " . His music still found an audience : in 1952 and 1953 With Honour Crowned was again played as a slow march at the Trooping the Colour ceremony . 
 Ketèlbey died in his Cowes home of heart and renal failure on 26 November 1959 . By the time of his death he had slipped into obscurity . Only a handful of mourners attended his funeral , which was held at Golders Green Crematorium in London . 
 = = Music = = 
 Under his own name and at least six pseudonyms Ketèlbey composed several hundred works , about 150 of them for the orchestra . In the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians , Phillip Scowcroft writes , " His gifts for melody and sensitive , colourful scoring ensured continuing popularity with light orchestras and bands until after 1945 . The most popular of his hundreds of pieces emphasize emotionalism and sometimes exaggerated effects at the expense of structure and harmonic subtlety . " 
 = = = Early works and serious music = = = 
 Ketèlbey 's early compositions are classical and orthodox in form , reflecting the training at Trinity College . The first substantial work was a piano sonata ( 1888 ) ; it was followed by a Caprice for piano and orchestra ( 1892 ) , a <unk> for piano and orchestra ( circa 1893 ) and a piano concerto in G minor ( 1895 ) . Ketèlbey 's piano writing was notable for its brilliance , and the composer 's own performance of the solo part of the <unk> brought out that quality . As a student , Ketèlbey composed a cadenza for the first movement of Beethoven 's First Piano Concerto , judged " clever and effective " in performance in 1890 . 
 For the chamber repertoire , Ketèlbey composed a string quartet ( c . 1896 ) and a quintet for piano and wind ( 1896 ) which won the Costa Prize and the College Gold Medal . His 1894 Romance for violin and piano was praised as " a charming , <unk> work " . His other early works include choral pieces , including the anthems " Every good Gift " ; " Behold upon the mountains " , and " Be strong , all ye people " ( all 1896 ) . After these works he moved professionally into conducting light opera , and serious music became the exception rather than the rule in his compositions . 
 Ketèlbey 's concert music was less well known in England than in continental Europe , where he conducted many programmes of his own works for the Concertgebouw Orchestra and others . The composer 's more avowedly serious music was less widely esteemed by his compatriots . In a 1928 profile the magazine The British Musician commented , " There is no need to explain here why his serious music , whether written thirty years ago or as recently as 1927 ... has not won the popularity of , say , Edward German 's dances : it is pleasant music , delightfully scored ; but it is not so fascinating as that from which it derives — the music of the Viennese writers of dance music , of <unk> and Gounod and the like . " The reviewer added , " Albert Ketèlbey 's works of the Monastery Garden type are by far the best that anyone in this country has written , and they represent the end to which he was born . " 
 = = = Light orchestral = = = 
 Ketèlbey , a capable player of the cello , clarinet , oboe , and horn , was a skilled orchestrator . He generally followed the normal style for light music of his day : picturesque and romantic , with colourful orchestral effects . Reviewing a collection of Ketèlbey 's music , the authors of The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music commented in 2008 , " when vulgarity is called for it is not shirked — only it 's a stylish kind of vulgarity ! " Many of Ketèlbey 's pieces are programmatic , typically lasting between four and six minutes . His penchant for arranging his works for various combinations of instruments makes them harder to categorise than the works of many other composers . His first two pieces to make a mark with a wide public were The Phantom Melody ( 1911 ) and In a Monastery Garden ( 1915 ) , both best known in their orchestral versions , but originally written for cello and piano and for solo piano respectively . For the familiar orchestral version of the second of these pieces the composer published a synopsis : 
 The first theme represents a poet 's reverie in the quietude of the monastery garden amidst beautiful surroundings — the calm serene atmosphere — the leafy trees and the singing birds . The second theme in the minor expresses the more ' personal ' note of sadness , of appeal and contrition . Presently , the monks are heard chanting the " Kyrie Eleison " with the organ playing and the chapel bell ringing . The first theme is now heard in a quieter manner as if it had become more ethereal and distant ; the singing of the monks is again heard — it becomes louder and more insistent , bringing the piece to a conclusion in a glow of exultation . 
 Ketèlbey followed the same basic formula for many of his most popular later works . For In a Persian Market his synopsis notes " the camel drivers approaching , the cries of beggars , entry of beautiful princess ( represented by a languorous theme given at first to clarinet and cello and then full orchestra ) ... she watches the jugglers and snake @-@ charmers ... the Caliph passes by , interrupting the entertainment ... all depart , their themes heard faintly in the distance , and the marketplace becomes deserted . " Ketèlbey establishes the eastern setting in the opening section , employing the distinctive melodic intervals , A – B ♭ – E. The orchestral players are instructed to sing at two points in the score , a descending motif representing beggars crying for <unk> . Although one contemporary critic belittled the music as " pseudo @-@ orientalism " , McCanna comments that " The princess portrayed by the big romantic theme is a cousin of the princesses in Stravinsky 's Firebird " . 
 Ketèlbey sought to repeat the exoticism of In a Persian Market in several later pieces . Among them is In a Chinese Temple Garden ( 1923 ) , described as an " oriental phantasy " , with episodes depicting a priestly incantation , two lovers , a wedding procession , a street brawl and the restoration of calm by the beating of the temple gong . Another example is In the Mystic Land of Egypt ( 1931 ) , which , like its Persian predecessor , opens with a vigorous march theme followed by a broad romantic melody . Again , the composer employs unconventional musical devices for colour — in this case a chromatic scale , descending at each appearance until the closing bars , where it is inverted . In 1958 , the critic Ronald Ever wrote that Ketèlbey was noted for his use of " every exotic noisemaker known to man — chimes , orchestra bells , gongs ( all sizes and nationalities ) , cymbals , woodblocks , xylophone , drums of every variety " . Ever commented that Ketèlbey 's exoticism had left an immovable impression of eastern music on western ears , to which " Oriental music is Ketèlbey music : the clashing cymbals ; the little pinging bells ; the minor modes ; the amazingly graphic mincing step created by rapidly reiterated notes ; the coy taps on the woodblock . " 
 Among Ketèlbey 's light orchestral works with a wholly British flavour is Bells Across the Meadows ( 1921 ) , redolent , in the words of McDonald , of " rose @-@ entwined thatched cottages standing amidst gardens full of hollyhocks with a gentle brook bubbling on its rustic way and cows grazing peacefully in the pastures beyond " . Urban life was evoked in the five @-@ movement Cockney Suite ( 1924 ) , described by The Times as " character pieces complete with leering saxophone , cheeky mouth @-@ organ , and some <unk> catchy tunes " . Ketèlbey depicts successively a royal procession from Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament ; an East End pub , with a main theme based on the Cockney ditty " ' Arf a pint of mild and bitter " ; a waltz at a palais de danse ; a sombre glimpse of the Cenotaph in Whitehall ; and in the finale , " ' Appy ' <unk> " , a picture of the August Bank Holiday fair on Hampstead Heath . 
 Much of the music Ketèlbey wrote as accompaniment to silent films between 1915 and 1929 , though lucrative at the time , has proved ephemeral , although he reused and rearranged some of it in solo pieces for amateur pianists . With the requirements of cinemas of all sizes in mind , his film music was published in the " Bosworth Loose Leaf Film Play Music Series " in versions for solo piano or for small orchestras . The titles offered included Dramatic <unk> , Amaryllis ( described by the composer as " suitable for use in dainty , fickle scenes " ) , Mystery ( " greatly in favour for uncanny and weird <unk> " ) , " <unk> Furioso " ( " famous for its excellence in playing to riots , storms , wars , etc . " ) and Bacchanale de Montmartre ( for " cabaret , orgy and riotous continental scenes " ) . 
 = = = Instrumental works = = = 
 In addition to arrangements for solo instruments of his popular orchestral works , Ketèlbey wrote a range of music for organ and for piano . Some of the more serious of these pieces were published under his " <unk> " pen name . Among the organ works are Pastorale and <unk> <unk> , both dating from about 1911 . The piano works include the early classical pieces such as the 1888 Sonata , and shorter items in a more popular style , such as <unk> ( 1894 ) and Les <unk> ( 1925 ) , by way of A Romantic Melody ( 1898 ) , Pensées <unk> ( 1888 ) , In the Woodlands ( 1921 ) , A Song of Summer ( 1922 ) , and <unk> triste ( 1923 ) . The musical influences on his piano works were on the whole conservative : for the early works McCanna mentions Haydn and Mendelssohn in this context . Much of the piano music published in the years after the First World War was aimed at a domestic audience ; it requires only a modest technical proficiency to play and is simple in structure with deft harmonies . The most commercially successful of the <unk> works was the Prelude in C ♯ minor ( 1907 ) . McCanna comments that not only the title but the material is reminiscent of Rachmaninoff : " the music turns out to copy some of the more illustrious composer 's features , notably the final fortissimo statement of the melody in the bass " . Ketèlbey followed Chopin 's model in several waltzes in the key of A ♭ major , including La <unk> ( 1907 ) and two different pieces under the title Valse brillante ( 1905 and 1911 ) . 
 = = = Songs = = = 
 Throughout his career Ketèlbey composed songs , providing the words for most of those written after 1913 . His first , unpublished , song , " Be Still , Sad Heart " dates from 1892 , and during the rest of the 1890s he wrote songs for children as well as sentimental ballads like " Believe Me True " ( 1897 ) for their seniors . Many had words by Florence Hoare , whose other lyrics included English words for songs by Tchaikovsky , Gounod and Brahms . Ketèlbey 's popular ballads included " The Heart 's Awakening " ( 1907 ) , " My Heart @-@ a @-@ dream " ( 1909 ) , " I Loved You More Than I Knew " ( 1912 ) , " My Heart Still Clings to You " ( 1913 ) , " Will You Forgive ? ( 1924 ) " , and " A Birthday Song " ( 1933 ) . He wrote patriotic songs for use in three wars : " There 's Something in the English After all " ( 1899 , during the Boer War ) , " The Trumpet Voice of Motherland is Calling " ( 1914 , for the First World War ) and " Fighting for Freedom " ( 1941 , during the Second World War ) . His sole Shakespeare setting , " Blow ! Blow ! Thou Winter Wind " ( 1898 , revised 1951 ) , was written as incidental music for a production of As You Like It . 
 = = Reputation and legacy = = 
 The obituarist for The Musical Times claimed that " Ketèlbey 's especial fame ... consisted in his phenomenal success as a composer of light music . His remarkable gift for alluring tunes , rich in homely sentiment , was reflected in the immense popularity of [ his ] pieces " . McCanna opines that Ketèlbey 's popularity 
 lay in its memorable expressive melodies combined with its ability to set the scene by enhanced use of different kinds of colour : local colour in the choice of characteristic settings , often with explicit narrative captions printed above the music ; musical colour in the form of exotic scales and harmonies ; orchestral colour in the novel use of singing by the players and of sound effects executed by the drummer . 
 During his tenure at Columbia , Ketèlbey promoted the works of several composers , including Haydn Wood , Charles <unk> , Ivor Novello , James W. Tate and Kenneth J. Alford , helping to increase the popularity of British light music . Ronnie <unk> made In a Monastery Garden his signature tune from 1958 , while Serge Gainsbourg used the theme of In a Persian Market for his 1977 song " My Lady <unk> " . 
 Dempsey , writing in 2001 , considered that Ketèlbey 's " late @-@ Romantic tone miniatures ... are deserving of reappraisal " . The composer 's reputation has improved over time , and the cultural historian Andrew Blake identifies a " form of ' cult following ' " for him . In the 21st century , Ketèlbey 's music is still frequently heard on radio and in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme Your Hundred Best Tunes , Bells across the Meadows was voted thirty @-@ sixth most popular tune of all time . The last night of the corporation 's 2009 Proms season included In a Monastery Garden to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Ketèlbey 's death ; it was the first time the tune had been included in the festival 's finale . Tim Page , the music critic for The Washington Post , considers that Ketèlbey 's work expresses an " ornate , perfumed , genteel Orientalism [ which ] found expression in miniatures " ; he adds that " all of Ketèlbey 's music is pretty weird — deeply derivative yet unmistakably personal , tidy in form yet grandiose in execution , amiable and often touching despite its unashamed mawkishness . " 
 = Ganteaume 's expeditions of 1801 = 
 Ganteaume 's expeditions of 1801 were three connected major French Navy operations of the spring of 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars . A French naval squadron from Brest under Contre @-@ amiral Honoré Ganteaume , seeking to reinforce the besieged French garrison in Egypt , made three separate but futile efforts to reach the Eastern Mediterranean . The French army in Egypt had been trapped there shortly after the start of the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt in 1798 , when the French Mediterranean Fleet was destroyed at the Battle of the Nile . Since that defeat , the French Navy had maintained only a minimal presence in the Mediterranean Sea , while the more numerous British and their allies had succeeded in blockading and defeating several French bases almost unopposed . 
 The despatch of Ganteaume 's squadron was a direct effort to restore balance to the situation in the Mediterranean by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte and on the first cruise it reached Toulon on 19 February 1801 , providing vital reinforcements to the remnants of the fleet there . The second expedition , launched from Toulon a month later , was forced back to the port by a combination of bad weather and the British blockade . The third expedition actually reached the Eastern Mediterranean and a fruitless attempt was made to land troops at Benghazi , before British ships from the blockade of Egypt successfully drove Ganteaume 's forces away . The French squadron returned to Toulon by 22 July , at which point the expedition was called off . Despite his failure to land troops in North Africa , Ganteaume did win a series of minor victories over lone British warships , including the frigate HMS Success and the ship of the line HMS Swiftsure , and several of his ships detached during the third expedition were subsequently involved in the Algeciras Campaign in July . Ultimately the inability of the French to break through the British blockade of Egypt resulted in the defeat and surrender of the garrison there later in the year . 
 = = Background = = 
 In May 1798 , a large French fleet of warships and transports crossed the Mediterranean Sea with an army of more than 35 @,@ 000 men under General Napoleon Bonaparte , intent on an invasion of Egypt , then nominally held by the neutral Ottoman Empire . Pausing to capture Malta , the French force then pressed on eastwards aware that a fleet under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson had entered the Mediterranean and was in pursuit . Successfully avoiding Nelson 's forces , the fleet reached Alexandria on 29 June and immediately invaded , rapidly advancing inland and defeating the Mamluk rulers of Egypt at the Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July . While the army had pushed inland , the fleet , under Vice @-@ Admiral François @-@ Paul Brueys D 'Aigalliers , had anchored in Aboukir Bay near Alexandria , and was found there in the afternoon of 1 August by Nelson 's fleet . Despite the growing darkness , Nelson attacked at once and in the three @-@ day Battle of the Nile destroyed or captured eleven ships of the line and two frigates . Just two ships of the line and two frigates escaped and among the more than 3 @,@ 000 casualties was Admiral Brueys , killed on his flagship Orient . 
 With his route back to France suddenly closed , Bonaparte consolidated his position in Egypt and then attacked north into Ottoman Syria . The operation achieved some initial success , but British dominance at sea heavily influenced the campaign : the siege train was captured on its coastal barges , all supplies had to be brought overland and any French operations near the shoreline came under heavy fire from Royal Navy warships , particularly at the culminating Siege of Acre . An attempt by the French Atlantic Fleet to intervene in the Mediterranean , known as the Croisière de Bruix , failed in July 1799 . Defeated at Acre and driven back to Egypt , Bonaparte decided to return to France in November 1799 in order to take charge of the deteriorating situation in the War of the Second Coalition . He could only evacuate a small number of advisors with him on the frigates Muiron and Carrère , but promised the army remaining in Egypt under General Jean Baptiste Kléber that he would send support and reinforcements from Europe . Bonaparte successfully reached France without interception by British forces and on 9 November 1799 seized power in the coup of 18 Brumaire and proclaimed himself First Consul . 
 While Bonaparte was preoccupied in the Middle East and then with French politics , the Royal Navy had returned to the Mediterranean in force . British forces had withdrawn from the region in 1796 after France and Spain became allies in the Treaty of San Ildefonso , but Nelson 's victory at the Nile had eliminated the French threat , allowing a large scale redeployment in the second half of the year . Malta was besieged , the Ionian Islands were captured by a joint Turkish and Russian force and successive efforts to reach the trapped garrison of Egypt were defeated at sea . Negotiations to return the French troops to Europe collapsed and although Kléber defeated an Ottoman attack at the Battle of Heliopolis on 20 March 1800 , he was assassinated in June . As morale fell , the situation in Egypt became increasingly desperate for the French garrison and the British planned an invasion for March 1801 . News of British intentions reached France where Bonaparte , who had successfully reorganised the French Army and driven back allied advances in Italy thus bringing the continental war to an end , ordered a squadron from the French Atlantic Fleet , based at Brest , to reinforce the garrison in Egypt . 
 = = First expedition = = 
 The squadron selected for the reinforcement of Egypt was placed under the command of Contre @-@ amiral Honoré Ganteaume , a survivor of the Battle of the Nile and therefore an officer with experience of service in the Eastern Mediterranean . Under Ganteaume 's command were three 80 @-@ gun and four 74 @-@ gun ships of the line , two frigates and a lugger which between them carried 5 @,@ 000 troops as reinforcements for the Army in Egypt under General Jean <unk> . Rumours were spread that the expedition was destined for the Caribbean to oppose the Haitian Revolution , and demonstrations were arranged at every French Atlantic and Channel port , intended to confuse the British blockade squadrons as to which ships were actually sailing and which were only giving the impression of doing so . Ganteaume 's squadron was ordered to sail from Brest on 7 January 1801 , but the diversion plan was not successful , as the British squadron that was permanently maintained off Brest under Rear @-@ Admiral Henry Harvey immediately gave chase to <unk> 's ships as they emerged from the Passage du Raz . Within hours , Ganteaume had been forced to take shelter under the batteries at the mouth of the River <unk> , pretending that his voyage had only been a feint like the other operations along the coast . A few days later he managed to slip back into Brest harbour . 
 On 23 January a heavy storm struck the Brittany coast , fierce northerly winds driving the British out to sea and leaving the entrance to Brest clear for Ganteaume 's escape . Driving out through the Iroise , the French ships were scattered by the storm and several suffered damage to their masts . The squadron broke into two bodies : a main force of six ships of the line , one frigate and the lugger under Commodore Moncousu and a smaller force under Ganteaume , with one ship of the line and one frigate . <unk> by the absent British , these forces passed southwest over the following five days , hoping to rendezvous at Cape Spartel . Both had encounters with scattered British warships : the larger body encountered the British frigate HMS Concorde under Captain Robert Barton at 09 : 00 on 27 January approximately 75 nautical miles ( 139 km ) northeast of Finisterre . Concorde was towing a seized Swedish merchant vessel , but abandoned the ship as soon as a ship of the line and the frigate Bravoure closed to investigate . 
 Concorde initially retreated before the advancing ships , but at 6 nautical miles ( 11 km ) distant from the squadron turned to meet Bravoure , which was now advancing alone . As he approached , Captain Louis @-@ Auguste Dordelin demanded that Barton surrender but was met with musket fire and both ships commenced a close range engagement with their main broadsides . For half an hour the battle continued until wreckage was seen falling from Bravoure and Barton ordered his ship to ceasefire on the assumption that the French ship had surrendered . In fact , Dordelin was hastily turning his ship back towards the squadron for support and although Concorde gave chase , Barton 's rigging was too severely damaged to continue the operation , Concorde turning back towards Europe at 03 : 00 on 28 January . Although Bravoure could still be seen in the distance the following morning , the continued presence of Moncousu 's ships rendered any further efforts to attack Bravoure too dangerous . The British ship had lost four killed and 19 wounded from a total of 244 crew members , the French ten killed and 24 wounded , including Captain <unk> , who had lost a hand . 
 = = = Entering the Mediterranean = = = 
 On 30 January , shortly before the separated squadron was reunited off Cape Spartel , Ganteaume 's ships also encountered a British vessel , chasing down the small fireship HMS Incendiary under Commander Richard Dalling Dunn . Incendiary was unable to resist the larger warships and after they had removed her crew her captors set fire to Incendiary , scuttling her . After passing southwards together , the united squadron reached the Straits of Gibraltar on 9 February and passed through them without resistance . As most of the British fleet was operating in the Mediterranean Sea and no news of Ganteaume 's operation had yet reached the authorities at Gibraltar , the only Royal Navy ship on hand to observe the French squadron was the 32 @-@ gun frigate HMS Success under Captain Shuldham Peard that lay at anchor off the British base . Peard correctly assumed that the French squadron was sailing for Egypt and decided to follow them , shadowing the French during 10 February . That day the French captured and scuttled the 10 @-@ gun cutter HMS Sprightly . In the evening , Ganteaume called his ships to a halt off Cape de Gata in the Alboran Sea and Peard unwittingly passed them in the night , so that by the morning of 11 February the French were in a position to pursue his frigate . 
 For three days Peard sailed north and east , on several occasions believing that he had lost the French only for Ganteaume 's ships to reappear over the horizon once more as light winds hampered his escape . At dawn on 13 February , Peard realised that he would eventually be caught and defeated , and swung Success back towards the west , hoping that by doing so he would lead the French straight into any British forces that might now be searching for Ganteaume . The plan failed when the wind disappeared completely at noon , and by 15 : 00 two French ships of the line had approached within gunshot . Hopelessly outnumbered , the frigate surrendered without further resistance and was attached to the French squadron as Succès , the crew provided by detachments from other vessels . Peard and his men joined the prisoners taken from Incendiary and Sprightly on Ganteaume 's flagship Indivisible and were closely questioned as to British movements in the Mediterranean . When interrogated , Peard informed Ganteaume that the invasion of Egypt was already underway , that the Eastern Mediterranean was controlled by a powerful fleet under Lord Keith and that a squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren was actively hunting the French and could appear at any moment . 
 The information that Ganteaume gleaned from his captive was largely false . A large expeditionary force and fleet under Lord Keith was in the Mediterranean but would not arrive in Egypt for more than two weeks , British landings eventually going ahead on 8 March . At the time Ganteaume questioned Peard , the force was anchored at <unk> on the southern coast of Anatolia , struggling with reluctant Ottoman allies and bad weather . In addition , there was little active pursuit of his squadron during February : when Concorde reached Plymouth on 3 February , urgent messages were sent to Earl St Vincent at the Admiralty who ordered the despatch of a fast squadron of six ships of the line , two frigates and a brig in search of Ganteaume 's ships . However , attached to command this force was Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Robert Calder , who traveled in a slow second rate ship of the line that significantly delayed the passage of his squadron . In any case , a miscalculation of Ganteaume 's intentions at the Admiralty resulted in orders for Calder 's squadron to sail to the West Indies , and they played no further part in the campaign . Warren , whose squadron was based off Cádiz , had learned of Ganteaume 's passage on 8 February and sailed to Gibraltar in pursuit before continuing to Minorca on 13 February , arriving on 20 February without seeing any sign of the French and subsequently sailing for Sicily in March after hearing news of the impending Treaty of Florence between France and the Kingdom of Naples . Despite the lack of genuine pursuit , Ganteaume was unnerved by the information gleaned from Peard , and ordered the squadron to sail for Toulon , arriving on 19 February without any further contact with the Royal Navy .
