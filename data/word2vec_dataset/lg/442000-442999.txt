 = Deshastha Brahmin = 
 Deshastha Brahmins are a Hindu Brahmin subcaste mainly from the Indian state of Maharashtra and northern area of the state of Karnataka . The word Deshastha derives from the Sanskrit <unk> ( inland , country ) and <unk> ( resident ) , literally translating to " residents of the country " . The valleys of the Krishna and the Godavari rivers , and a part of Deccan plateau adjacent to the Sahyadri hills , are collectively termed the Desha – the original home of the Deshastha Brahmins . 
 Over the millennia , the community produced the eighth century Sanskrit scholar Bhavabhuti , the thirteenth century Varkari saint and philosopher Dnyaneshwar , and Samarth Ramdas . All of the Peshwas during Chhatrapati Shivaji 's and Sambhaji 's reign were Deshasthas . 
 Brahmins constitute four percent of Maharashtra 's population , and 60 percent of them are Deshastha Brahmins . The second largest Maharashtrian Brahmin community , the Konkanastha Brahmins , who historically lagged the Deshastha Brahmins socioeconomically and in Brahmin rituals achieved parity with them in the nepotistic era that followed the passing of the seat of the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire into Konkanastha hands in 1713 . This era marked a period of social warfare between the two Brahmin sub @-@ castes . 
 = = Classification = = 
 The Hindu caste system is first mentioned in the ancient Hindu scriptures like the Vedas and the Upanishads . Various sub @-@ classifications of the caste system exist , many based on the geographical origin of the caste . 
 Deshastha Brahmins fall under the Pancha Dravida Brahmin classification of the Brahmin community in India . Other Brahmin sub @-@ castes in the region are <unk> Brahmin , <unk> , Konkanastha and Goud Saraswat Brahmin , but these sub @-@ castes only have a regional significance . Goud Saraswat Brahmins fall under the Pancha <unk> Brahmin classification , i.e. North Indian Brahmins . The Vedas are the world 's oldest texts that are still used in worship and they are the oldest literature of India . Four Vedas exists of which the Rig Veda is the oldest . They were handed down from one generation of Brahmins to the next verbally and memorised by each generation . They were written down sometime around 400 BC . Other Vedas include the Yajur Veda , the Atharva Veda and the Sama Veda . Two different versions of the Yajur Veda exist , the White ( Shukla in Sanskrit ) and the black or ( Krishna in Sanskrit ) . The Shukla Yajur Veda has a two different branches ( Shakha in <unk> ) called the <unk> and the Madhyandin . Deshastha Brahmins are further classified in two major sub @-@ sects , the <unk> Rigvedi and the Deshastha Yajurvedi , based on the Veda they follow . The Yajurvedis are further classified into two groups called the <unk> and the <unk> . The <unk> follow the Madhyandin branch of the Shukla Yajur Veda . The word Madhyandin is a fusion of two words Madhya and din which mean middle and day respectively . They are so called because they perform Sandhya Vandana at noon . Almost without exception , the several regional groups of the Madhyandin Brahmins are indistinguishable from the Kshatriya Marathas due to similar physical features . A similar study of four groups that have been resident in Mumbai and surrounding areas for generations , using blood group markers , found the Deshastha Rigvedi and the Marathas to be genetically closer to each other than to the Gujarati Patel and the Parsi communities . <unk> Brahmins were traditionally located in and around Nasik , and they call themselves <unk> or followers of the first branch of the White <unk> . The Madhyandin Yajurvedis arrived in the Nashik district of Maharashtra from Gujarat about 500 years ago . 
 Recently , the Yajurvedi Madhyandin and Yajurvedi <unk> Brahmins have been colloquially being referred to as Deshastha Yajurvedi Madhyandin and Deshastha Yajurvedi <unk> , although not all have traditionally lived or belonged to the Desh . 
 The Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins are treated as a separate and distinct caste from the Yajurvedi <unk> and <unk> <unk> by several authors , including Malhotra , Karve and Wilson . 
 There is a significant <unk> population in the state of Karnataka , and here , the sub @-@ classification of Deshastha Brahmins is based on the type of Hindu philosophical system they follow . These are the Deshastha Madhva Brahmins who follow the teachings of Madhvacharya and the Deshastha Smartha Brahmins who follow the teachings of Adi Shankaracharya . The surnames of these North <unk> based , Kannada speaking Deshastha Brahmins , can be identical to those of Maharashtrian Deshastha Brahmins , for example , they have last names like Kulkarni , Deshpande and Joshi . <unk> are allowed between the Karnatak Brahmans and the Deshasthas and so the classification of the Southern India Brahmans into the Maharashtra , the Andhra ( Telugu ) and the Karnatic are in this respect , more of a provincial or linguistic character than an ethnographic one . 
 = = = Castes claiming to be Deshasthas = = = 
 The Golak or <unk> , follow the customs of the Deshasthas and claim to be Deshasthas . The other Brahmins traditionally did not accept this , and the Deshasthas did not socialise and intermingle with them . The Maharashtra State Gazetteer records the Golak or Govardhan as being considered degraded because they sold their cows instead of rearing them . Traditionally , the caste headman was generally someone with a smattering of Sanskrit and was called a <unk> . They were the earliest settlers in and around Nasik . Golaks are divided into Kunda Golak and Randa Golak , both of whom are descendants of illegitimate offsprings of Brahmins . The Kunda Golak are the offsprings of the adultery between a Brahmin father and a Brahmin woman who is not his legally wedded wife . The Randa Golaks are similar to the Kunda Golak in their origin , with the difference that they are the illegitimate descendants of Brahmin widows . Both do not accept new illegitimate Brahmins in their caste . Traditional occupations of both Kunda and Randa Golaks are generally shopkeepers , astrologers and cultivators . They are sometimes also called <unk> Brahmins . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 Brahmins constitute 4 percent of the population of Maharashtra , and 60 percent of them are Deshastha Brahmins . The valleys of the Krishna and the Godavari rivers , and the plateaus of the Sahyadri hills , are collectively called the Desha – the original home of the Deshastha Brahmins . Traditional social studies and recent genetic studies show Deshastha Brahmin to be ethnically indistinguishable from the population of Maharashtra . In his report on the 1901 census , Sir Herbert Hope Risley classified many castes from Western India including Maratha , Brahman and <unk> as belonging to the <unk> @-@ Dravidian type . 
 The Deshastha Brahmins are equally distributed all through the state of Maharashtra , ranging from villages to urban areas . Marathi speaking Deshastha can also be found in large numbers outside Maharashtra such as in the cities of Indore , Gwalior , Baroda and Thanjavur , which were a part of or were influenced by , the Maratha Empire . The Deshastha Brahmins of Baroda are immigrants who came from the Desh for State service during the rule of <unk> . 
 The military settlers ( of Thanjavur ) included both Brahmins and Marathas , and by reason of their isolation from their distant home , the sub @-@ divisions which separated these castes in their mother @-@ country were forgotten , and they were all welded together under the common name of Deshasthas . The Brahmin migrants and the Maratha migrants both call themselves " Deshasthas " as both groups migrated to Tanjore from the Desh region of Maharashtra , but till today maintain their separate identities , despite the common " Deshastha " tag . Today 's Marathi speaking Thanjavur population are descendants of the Marathi speaking immigrants who immigrated to Tamil Nadu in the 17th and 18th centuries . The isolation from their homeland has almost made them culturally and linguistically alien to Brahmins in Maharashtra . For example , Thanjavur Marathi would sound as a strange mixture of Marathi and Tamil to a Maharashtrian in Pune and would hardly be intelligible to him . Likewise a Tanjore Maharashtrian would find it difficult to follow Pune Marathi . Tanjore Maharashtrian Brahmins who call themselves Deshasthas maintain their distinct brahminical identity which can be seen in their religious and wedding customs . Almost all their customs can be traced to the practices conducted by the early Maharashtrian settlers of Tanjore . They belong to two major groups , the Madhwa Deshastha Brahmins and Smartha Deshastha Brahmins . Arranged marriages between these two groups are common . Both these sub @-@ groups do not conduct arranged marriages with the Maratha caste of Tanjavur . However , Madhwa Deshastha Brahmins and Smartha Deshastha Brahmins of Tanjavur conduct arranged marriages with Madhwa Kannada Brahmins and Smartha Kannada Brahmins . In 2000 , a 90 @-@ year @-@ old community member estimated that there had been 500 Marathi families in a particular neighbourhood of Tanjavur in 1950 , of which only 50 remained in 2000 .

 The word Deshastha comes from the Sanskrit words Desha and <unk> , which mean inland or country and resident respectively . Fused together , the two words literally mean " residents of the country " . Deshastha are the Maharashtrian Brahmin community with the longest known history , making them the original and the oldest Hindu Brahmin sub @-@ caste from the Indian state of Maharashtra . The Deshastha community may be as old as the Vedas , as vedic literature describes people strongly resembling Deshasthas . This puts Deshastha presence on the Desh between 1100 – 1700 BC , thus making the history of the Deshastha Brahmins older than that of their mother tongue of Marathi , which itself originated in 1000 AD . As the original Brahmins of Maharashtra , the Deshasthas have been held in the greatest esteem in Maharashtra and they have considered themselves superior to other Brahmins . The history of Maharashtra before the 12th century is quite sparse , but Deshastha history is well documented . The traditional occupation of the Deshasthas was that of priesthood at the Hindu temples or at socio @-@ religious ceremonies . Records show that most of the religious and literary leaders since the 13th century have been Deshasthas . In addition to being village priests , most of the village accountants belonged to the Deshastha caste . Priests at the famous Vitthal temple in Pandharpur are Deshastha , as are the priests in many of Pune 's temples . Other traditional occupations included village revenue officials , academicians , astrologer , administrators and practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine . Deshasthas who study the vedas are called <unk> , astrologers are called <unk> or Joshi , and practitioners of medical science are called <unk> , and reciters of the puranas are called <unk> . Some are also engaged in farming . An author recorded in 1896 that Deshasthas have been and still continue to be , the great <unk> in almost every branch of Sanskrit learning . According to the Anthropological Survey of India , the Deshasthas are a progressive community and some of them have taken to white collar jobs . The Deshastha Brahmins helped build the Maratha Empire and once built , helped in its administration . Deshasthas have contributed to the fields of Sanskrit and Marathi literature , mathematics , and philosophy .

 Deshasthas produced prominent literary figures in Maharashtra between the 13th and the 19th centuries . The great Sanskrit scholar Bhavabhuti was a Deshastha Brahmin who lived around 700 AD in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra . His works of high Sanskrit poetry and plays are only equalled by those of Kalidasa . Two of his best known plays are <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> is a work on the early life of the Hindu god Rama , whereas Malati Madhava is a love story between Malati and her lover Madhava , which has a happy ending after several twists and turns . Mukund Raj was another poet from the community who lived in the 13th century and is said to be the first poet who composed in Marathi . He is known for the Viveka @-@ Siddhi and <unk> which are metaphysical , pantheistic works connected with orthodox <unk> . Other well known Deshastha literary scholars of the 17th century were <unk> and Shridhar . <unk> was the grandson of Eknath and is the most distinguished poet in the ovi meter . He is most known for translating the Mahabharata and the Ramayana in Marathi but only a part of the Mahabharata translation is available and the entire Ramayana translation is lost . Shridhar Kulkarni came from near Pandharpur and his works are said to have superseded the Sanskrit epics to a certain extent . Other major literary contributors of the 17th and the 18th century were <unk> Pandit , Mahipati , <unk> , Anant <unk> and <unk> . 
 The 17th century mathematician Kamalakara , was a forward @-@ looking astronomer @-@ mathematician who studied Hindu , Greek and Arabic astronomy . His most important work was the Siddhanta @-@ <unk> . He studied and agreed with Ptolemaic notions of the planetary systems . He was the first and the only traditional astronomer to present geometrical optics . Kamalakara proposed a new Prime Meridian which passed through the imaginary city of <unk> , and provided a table of latitudes and longitudes for 24 cities within and outside of India . 
 The Deshastha community has produced several saints and philosophers . Most important of these were Dnyaneshwar , Eknath and Ramdas . The most revered of all Bhakti saints , Dnyaneshwar was universally acclaimed for his commentary on the <unk> Gita . He lived in the 13th century . Eknath was yet another Bhakti saint who published an extensive poem called the <unk> Bhagwat in the 16th century . Other works of Eknath include the Bhavartha Ramayana , the Rukmini <unk> and the <unk> <unk> . The 17th century saw the <unk> of the saint Samarth Ramdas , who was also the spiritual adviser to Shivaji .

 Most of Shivaji 's principal Brahmin officers were Deshasthas . Some important contributors were warriors like Neelkanth <unk> , <unk> Narayan Deshpande , <unk> <unk> , Balaji and <unk> Deshpande of Pune , Ragho <unk> <unk> , Moropant <unk> , <unk> Dato <unk> and <unk> Pandit . At one point in Maratha Empire , seven of eight <unk> came from the community which included important posts of <unk> ( ecclesiastical head ) and <unk> ( chief justice ) . The Deshasthas were the natural leaders in the era of the foundation of the Maratha empire . Most importantly , all of the Peshwas during Shivaji 's time were Deshasthas . In 1713 , Balaji Vishwanath Bhat was appointed as the fifth Peshwa and the seat of Peshwa remained in Konkanastha hands until the fall of the Maratha Empire . In order to obtain the loyalty of the powerful Deshastha Brahmins , the Konkanastha Peshwas established a system of patronage for Brahmin scholars . 
 The Konkanastha Peshwa Baji Rao I who coveted conquering Vasai or Bassein , sent an <unk> to the Portuguese governor of Bassein . The governor , Luís Botelho , insulted the envoy by calling Baji Rao a nigger . The Peshwa then deployed his brother , <unk> Appa in the conquest of Vasai . This was a hard fought battle with the British supplying the Portuguese with advice and the Marathas with equipment . <unk> Mankar of the Pathare Prabhu caste and <unk> Raghunath , a Yajurvedi Brahmin , both played important roles in the battle . After the victory in 1739 , the <unk> of Vasai was promised to <unk> Raghunath , but the promise was not kept by the Konkanastha Peshwas , who instead harassed the Yajurvedis . Fed up with the humiliation , the Yajurvedi Brahmins migrated to Mumbai along with the Pathare Prabhus to work for the British .

 The majority of Deshasthas speak Marathi , one of the major languages of the mainly northern Indo @-@ Aryan language group . The major dialects of Marathi are called Standard Marathi and <unk> Marathi . Standard Marathi is the official language of the State of Maharashtra . The language of Pune 's Deshastha Brahmins has been considered to be the standard Marathi language and the pronunciation of the Deshastha Rigvedi is given prominence . There are a few other sub @-@ dialects like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Marathi . There are no inherently <unk> vowels in standard Marathi whereas the <unk> dialect of Marathi does have <unk> vowels . 
 By tradition , like other Brahmin communities of Southern India , Deshastha Brahmins are lacto vegetarian . Typical Deshastha cuisine consists of the simple <unk> made from <unk> dal . <unk> , a powdered mixture of several <unk> and a few spices is also a part of traditional Deshastha cuisine . Deshastha use black spice mix or kala , literally black , masala , in cooking . Traditionally , each family had their own recipe for the spice mix . However , this tradition is dying out as modern households buy pre @-@ packaged mixed spice directly from supermarkets . Puran poli for festivals and on the first day of the two @-@ day marriage is another Marathi Brahmin special dish . 
 Most middle aged and young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and trousers or shalwar kameez with the traditionally <unk> or nine @-@ yard sari , disappearing from the markets due to a lack of demand . Older women wear the five @-@ yard sari . Traditionally , Brahmin women in Maharashtra , unlike those of other castes , did not cover their head with the end of their saree . In urban areas , the five @-@ yard sari is worn by younger women for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies . Maharashtrian brides prefer the very Maharashtrian saree – the <unk> – for their wedding day . 
 In early to mid 20th century , Deshastha men used to wear a black cap to cover their head , with a turban or a <unk> being popular before that . For religious ceremonies males wore a coloured silk dhoti called a <unk> . In modern times , dhotis are only worn by older men in rural areas . In urban areas , just like women , a range of styles are preferred . For example , the Deshastha politician Manohar Joshi prefers white fine khadi kurtas , while younger men prefer modern western clothes such as jeans . 
 In the past , caste or social disputes used to be resolved by joint meetings of all Brahmin sub @-@ caste men in the area .

 Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins still recite the Rig Veda at religious ceremonies , prayers and other occasions . These ceremonies include birth , wedding , initiation ceremonies , as well as death rituals . Other ceremonies for different occasions in Hindu life include <unk> which is performed before a family formally establishes residence in a new house , Satyanarayana Puja , originating in Bengal in the 19th century , is a ceremony performed before commencing any new endeavour or for no particular reason . <unk> the name of the family 's gotra and the kula <unk> are important aspects of these ceremonies . Like most other Hindu communities , Deshasthas have a shrine called a <unk> in their house with idols , symbols , and pictures of various deities . Ritual reading of religious texts called <unk> is also popular . 
 In traditional families , any food is first offered to the preferred deity as naivedya , before being consumed by family members and guests . Meals or snacks are not taken before this religious offering . In contemporary Deshasthas families , the naivedya is offered only on days of special religious significance . 
 Deshasthas , like all other Hindu Brahmins , trace their paternal ancestors to one of the seven or eight sages , the <unk> . They classify themselves into eight gotras , named after the ancestor rishi . Intra @-@ marriage within gotras ( <unk> Vivaha ) was uncommon until recently , being discouraged as it was likened to incest , although the taboo has considerably reduced in the case of modern families who are bound by more practical considerations . 
 In a court case " Madhavrao versus <unk> " , involving a Deshastha Brahmin couple , the German philosopher and Indologist Max Müller 's definition of gotra as descending from eight sages and then branching out to several families was thrown out by reputed judges of a Bombay High Court . The court called the idea of Brahmin families descending from an unbroken line of common ancestors as indicated by the names of their respective gotras impossible to accept . The court consulted relevant Hindu texts and stressed the need for Hindu society and law to keep up with the times emphasising that notions of good social behaviour and the general ideology of Hindu society had changed . The court also said that the mass of material in the Hindu texts are so vast and full of contradictions that it is almost an impossible task to reduce it to order and coherence . 
 Every Deshastha family has their own family patron deity or the Kuladaivat . This deity is common to a lineage or a clan of several families who are connected to each other through a common ancestor . The Khandoba of Jejuri is an example of a Kuladaivat of some Maharashtrian Deshastha families ; he is a common Kuladaivat to several castes ranging from Brahmins to Dalits . The practice of worshiping local or territorial deities as <unk> began in the period of the Yadava dynasty . Other family deities of the people of Maharashtra are Bhavani of <unk> , Mahalaxmi of Kolhapur , Mahalaxmi of Amravati , Renuka of <unk> , Parashuram in Konkan , <unk> on <unk> hill at Vani in Nasik district . Despite being the most popular deity amongst Deshastha and other Marathi people , very few families regard Vitthal or other popular Avatars of Vishnu such as Rama or Krishna as their <unk> , with Balaji being an exception .

 Upon birth , a child is initiated into the family ritually according to the Rig Veda for the Rigvedi Brahmins . The naming ceremony of the child may happen many weeks or even months later , and it is called the <unk> . In many Hindu communities around India , the naming is almost often done by consulting the child 's horoscope , in which are suggested various names depending on the child 's Lunar sign ( called Rashi ) . However , in Deshastha families , the name that the child inevitably uses in secular functioning is the one decided by his parents . If a name is chosen on the basis of the horoscope , then that is kept a secret to ward off casting of a spell on the child during his or her life . During the naming ceremony , the child 's paternal aunt has the honour of naming the infant . When the child is 11 months old , he or she gets their first hair @-@ cut . This is an important ritual as well and is called <unk> . 
 When a male child reaches his eighth birthday he undergoes the initiation thread ceremony variously known as Munja ( in reference to the Munja grass that is of official ritual specification ) , <unk> , or <unk> . From that day on , he becomes an official member of his caste , and is called a <unk> which translates to " twice @-@ born " in English , in the sense that while the first birth was due to his biological parents , the second one is due to the initiating priest and Savitri . Traditionally , boys are sent to <unk> to learn Vedas and scriptures . Boys are expected to practice extreme discipline during this period known as brahmacharya . Boys are expected to lead a celibate life , live off alms , consume selected vegetarian <unk> food and observe considerable austerity in behaviour and deeds . Though such practices are not followed in modern times by a majority of Deshasthas , all Deshasthas boys undergo the sacred thread ceremony . Many still continue to get initiated around eight years of age . Those who skip this get initiated just before marriage . Twice @-@ born Deshasthas perform annual ceremonies to replace their sacred threads on Narali Purnima or the full moon day of the month of Shravan , according to the Hindu calendar . The threads are called <unk> in Marathi and <unk> in Kannada . 
 The Deshasthas are historically an endogamous and monogamous community for whom marriages take place by negotiation . The Mangalsutra is the symbol of marriage for the woman . Studies show that most Indians ' traditional views on caste , religion and family background have remained unchanged when it came to marriage , that is , people marry within their own castes , and matrimonial advertisements in newspapers are still classified by caste and sub @-@ caste . In 1907 , Rivers and Ridgeway record that Deshasthas allowed cross cousin marriages , just like other South Indian castes . 
 While arranging a marriage , gana , gotra , <unk> , <unk> are all kept in mind . <unk> are matched . Ghosal describes the marriage ceremony as , " The groom , along with the bride 's party goes to the bride 's house . A ritual named <unk> is performed in which people around the groom and bride throw <unk> ( turmeric ) and <unk> ( vermilion ) coloured rice grains on the couple . After the <unk> ceremony , there is an exchange of garlands between the bride and the groom . Then , the groom ties the Mangalsutra around the neck of the bride . This is followed by <unk> in which the end of the bride 's sari is tied to the end of the groom 's dhoti , and a feast is arranged at the groom 's place . " 
 A Deshasthas marriage ceremony includes many elements of a traditional Marathi Hindu wedding ceremony . It consists of <unk> <unk> on the wedding eve . The dharmic wedding includes the <unk> ceremony followed by the vedic ceremony which involves the bridegroom and the bride walking around the sacred fire seven times to complete the marriage . Modern urban wedding ceremonies conclude with an evening reception . A Deshastha woman becomes part of her husband 's family after marriage and adopts the gotra as well as the traditions of her husband 's family . 
 After weddings and also after thread ceremonies , Deshastha families arrange a traditional religious singing performance by a <unk> group 
 Decades ago , Deshastha girls used to get married to the groom of their parents ' choice by early teens or before . Even today , girls are married off in their late teens by rural and less educated amongst Deshastha . Urban women may choose to remain unmarried until the late 20s or even early 30s . 
 The 1881 Kolhapur gazetteer records that Deshastha widows at that time used to shave their heads and wear simple red saris . A widow also had to stop wearing the <unk> on her forehead . In the past , a Deshastha widow was never allowed to remarry , while it was acceptable for Deshastha widowers to remarry , and the widows had to lead a very austere life with little joy . Divorces were non @-@ existent . All of these practices have gradually fallen by the wayside over the last hundred years , and modern Deshastha widows lead better lives and younger widows also remarry . Divorce takes place by mutual consent and legal approval is sought . 
 Deshastha Brahmins dispose their dead by cremation . The dead person 's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier . The eldest son lights the fire to the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females . The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river on the third day after the death . This is a 13 @-@ day ritual with the <unk> being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th . Cremation is performed according to vedic rites , usually within a day of the individual 's death . Like all other Hindus , the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river . Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered . These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants , preferably the eldest son of the deceased .

 Deshasthas follow the Saka calendar . They follow several of the festivals of other Hindu Marathi people . These include Gudi Padwa , Rama Navami , Hanuman Jayanti , Narali Pournima , Mangala Gaur , Krishna Janmashtami , Ganesh Chaturthi , <unk> Purnima , Diwali , Khandoba Festival ( Champa Shashthi ) , Makar Sankranti , Maha Shivaratri and Holi . 
 Of these , Ganesh Chaturthi is the most popular in the state of Maharashtra , however , Diwali , the most popular festival of Hindus throughout India , is equally popular in Maharashtra . Deshasthas celebrate the Ganesha festival as a private , domestic family affair . Depending on a family 's tradition , a clay image or <unk> is worshiped for one and a half , three and a half , seven or full 10 days , before ceremoniously being placed in a river or the sea . This tradition of private celebration runs parallel to that of public celebration introduced in 1894 by Bal Gangadhar Tilak . <unk> is a popular food item during the festival . <unk> also incorporates other festivals , namely <unk> and the Gauri festival , the former is observed with a fast by women whilst the latter by the installation of idols of <unk> .

A snack eaten by new mothers called <unk> or <unk> is the prasad or the religious food on Rama Navami . Deshastha Brahmins observe Narali @-@ <unk> festival on the same day as the much widely known north Indian festival of Raksha Bandhan . Deshastha men change their sacred thread on this day . ] 
 An important festival for the new brides is Mangala Gaur . It is celebrated on any Tuesday of <unk> and involves the worship of lingam , a gathering of womenfolk and narrating limericks or <unk> using their husbands ' first name .

The first born of the family is honored on this day . 
 In Deshastha families <unk> is more commonly known as Gauri @-@ Ganpati because it also incorporates the Gauri <unk> some families Gauri is also known as Lakshmi puja . It is celebrated for three days ; on the first day , Lakshmi 's arrival is observed . The ladies in the family will bring statues of Lakshmi from the door to the place where they will be worshiped . The <unk> Brahmins , instead of statues , use special stones as symbols of Gauri . The statues are settled at a certain location ( very near the <unk> ) , adorned with clothes and ornaments . On the second day , the family members get together and prepare a meal consisting of <unk> poli . This day is the puja day of Mahalakshmi and the meal is offered to Mahalakshmi and her blessings sought . On the third day , Mahalakshmi goes to her husband 's home . Before the departure , ladies in the family will invite the neighbourhood ladies for exchange of <unk> @-@ kumkum .

 Navaratri , a nine @-@ day festival starts on the first day of the month of Ashvin and culminates on the tenth day or Vijayadashami . This is the one of three auspicious days of the year . People exchange leaves of the <unk> tree as symbol of gold . During Navaratri women and girls hold <unk> referred as <unk> in <unk> region , a singing party in honour of the Goddess . 
 Like all Hindu Marathi people and to a varying degree with other Hindu Indians , Diwali is celebrated over five days by the Deshastha Brahmins . Deshastha Brahmins celebrate this by waking up early in the morning and having an <unk> . People light their houses with lamps and candles , and burst fire crackers over the course of the festival . Special sweets and savouries like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are prepared for the festival . Colorful Rangoli drawings are made in front of the house . Marathi children make a replica mud fort in memory of Shivaji , the great Maratha king . 
 Deshastha Brahmins observe the Khandoba Festival or Champa Shashthi in the month of <unk> . This is a six @-@ day festival , from the first to sixth lunar day of the bright fortnight . Deshastha households perform <unk> of Khandoba during this festival . The sixth day of the festival is called Champa Sashthi . For Deshastha , the Chaturmas period ends on Champa Sashthi . As it is customary in many families not to consume onions , garlic and eggplant ( <unk> / Aubergine ) during the Chaturmas , the consumption of these food items resumes with ritual preparation of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) and <unk> , small round flat breads prepared from <unk> ( white millet ) . 
 Makar Sankranti falls on 14 January when the Sun enters Capricorn .

 Maha Shivaratri is celebrated in the month of Magha to honour Shiva . A chutney made from the fruit of curd fruit ( <unk> in Marathi ) , elephant apple , monkey fruit or wood apple is a part of the cuisine of the day . 
 Holi falls on the full moon day in Phalguna , the last month . Deshasthas celebrate this festival by lighting a bonfire and offering Puran Poli to the fire . Unlike North Indians , Deshastha Brahmins celebrate colour throwing five days after Holi on <unk> .

 <unk> Brahmins were absentee landlords and lived off the surplus without tilling the land themselves per ritual restrictions . They were often seen as the exploiter of the tiller . This situation started to change when the newly independent India enshrined in its constitution , agrarian or land reform . Between 1949 – 1959 , the state governments started enacting legislation in accordance with the constitution implementing this agrarian reform or Kula <unk> in Marathi . The legislation led to the abolition of various absentee tenures like <unk> and jagirs . This implementation of land reform had mixed results in different States . On official inquiry , it was revealed that not all absentee tenures were abolished in the State of Maharashtra as of 1985 . Other social and political issues include anti @-@ Brahminism and the treatment of Dalits . 
 = = = Inter @-@ caste issues = = = 
 Maharashtrian Brahmins were the primary targets during the anti @-@ Brahmin riots in Maharashtra in 1948 , following Mahatma Gandhi 's assassination . The rioters burnt homes and properties owned by Brahmins . The violent riots exposed the social tensions between the Marathas and the Brahmins . 
 In recent history , on 5 January 2004 , the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute ( BORI ) in Pune was vandalised by 150 members of the Sambhaji Brigade , an organisation promoting the cause of the Marathas . The organisation was protesting against a derogatory remark made by the American author James Laine , on Shivaji 's Parentage in his book , Shivaji : A Hindu King in an Islamic Kingdom . BORI was targeted because <unk> <unk> , a scholar at BORI , was acknowledged in Laine 's book . The incident highlighted the traditionally uncomfortable Brahmin @-@ Maratha relationship . Recently , the same organisation demanded the removal of <unk> <unk> from the Statue of Child Shivaji ploughing Pune 's Land at Lal Mahal , Pune . They also threatened that if their demands were not met , they would demolish that part of statue themselves . 
 Until recent times , like other high castes of Maharashtra and India , Deshastha also followed the practice of segregation from other castes considered lower in the social hierarchy . Until a few decades ago , a large number of Hindu temples , presumably with a Deshastha priest , barred entry to the so @-@ called " untouchables " ( Dalit ) . An example of this was the case of the 14th century saint Chokhamela . He was time and again denied entry to the Vitthal temple in Pandharpur , however , his mausoleum was built in front of the gate of the temple . In the early 20th century , the Dalit leader Dr. Ambedkar , while attempting to visit the temple , was stopped at the burial site of Chokhamela and denied entry beyond that point for being a Mahar . Deshastha caste @-@ fellow Dnyaneshwar and his entire family were stripped of their caste and excommunicated by the Deshasthas because of his father 's return from sanyasa to family life . The family was harassed and humiliated to an extent that Dnyaneshwar 's parents committed suicide . Other saints of the Varkari movement like Chokhamela ( Mahar caste ) , and Tukaram ( <unk> caste ) were discriminated against by the Brahmins . 
 The Maharashtra Government has taken away the hereditary rights of priesthood to the Pandharpur temple from the <unk> and <unk> Deshastha families , and handed them over to a governmental committee . The families have been fighting complex legal battles to win back the rights . The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh , an organisation founded by K. B. <unk> advocates Dalits being head priests at Hindu temples . Deshastha Brahmins such as Dr. <unk> and Mahadev Ambedkar supported and helped Dalit leaders like Mahatma Phule and Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar respectively . Dr. Ambedkar expressed gratitude towards Mahadev Ambedkar many times in his speeches . 
 = = = Deshastha @-@ Konkanastha relations = = = 
 The prominence of a Brahmin in Indian society was directly related to his virtues , values , knowledge and practice of the scriptures . Manu 's list of virtues of a perfect Brahmin , according to Italian Jesuit Roberto de Nobili , in order of importance were righteousness , truthfulness , generosity , <unk> , compassion , self @-@ restraint and diligent work . Prior to the rise of the Konkanastha Peshwas , the Konkanastha Brahmins were considered inferior in a society where the Deshasthas held socio @-@ economic , ritual and Brahminical superiority . As mentioned earlier , all the Peshwa during Shivaji 's rule were Deshastha Brahmins and many modern families who have surname , <unk> , are in fact Deshastha Brahmins tracing descent to Shivaji 's Peshwa , Moropant Pingle or <unk> <unk> . . After the appointment of Balaji Vishwanath Bhat as Peshwa , Konkanastha migrants began arriving en masse from the Konkan to Pune , where the Peshwa offered all important offices to the Konkanastha caste . The Konkanastha kin were rewarded with tax relief and grants of land . Historians point out nepotism and corruption during this time . The Sahyadri <unk> which contains the legend of the origin of the Konkanastha has been carefully suppressed or destroyed by the Konkanastha Peshwas . Crawford , an early Indologist described how a Brahmin reluctantly produced the manuscript when he asked for it and that Baji Rao , in 1814 , ruined and disgraced a respectable Deshastha Brahmin of Wai , found in possession of a copy of the Sahyadri <unk> . The Konkanasthas were waging a social war on <unk> during the period of the Peshwas . By the late 18th century , Konkanasthas had established complete political and economic dominance in the region . Richard Maxwell Eaton states that this rise of the Konkanastha is a classic example of social rank rising with political fortune . Since then , despite being the traditional religious and social elites of Maharashtra , the Deshastha Brahmins failed to feature as prominently as the Konkanastha . However , in recent decades , there have been <unk> who have made a mark . One such person was the late Bharatiya Janata Party politician Pramod Mahajan , who was called a brilliant strategist and had an impact nationwide . Other notables include Manohar Joshi , who has been the only Brahmin chief minister of Maharashtra , Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh founder Dr. <unk> , social activist , Baba Amte , BJP politician and Social activist , Nanaji Deshmukh and present chief minister of Maharashtra , Devendra <unk> . The Deshasthas looked down upon the Konkanasthas as newcomers in the 18th and 19th centuries . They refused to socialise and intermingle with them , not considering them to be Brahmins . A <unk> who was invited to a Deshastha household was considered to be a privileged individual , and even the Peshwas were refused permission to perform religious rites at the Deshastha ghats on the Godavari at Nasik . The Konkanasthas on their part , claimed they possessed greater intellectual ability and better political acumen . During the British colonial period of 19th and early 20th century , Deshasthas dominated professions such as government administration , practice of medicine , music , legal and engineering fields , whereas Konkanasthas dominated fields like politics , social reform , journalism and education . This situation has since improved by the larger scale mixing of both communities on social , financial and educational fields , as well as with intermarriages . 
 = = = Community organisations = = = 
 The Deshastha Rigvedi sub @-@ caste have community organizations in many major cities such as Mumbai , <unk> , Belgaum , Nasik , Satara etc . Most of these organizations are affiliated to Central organization of the community called Akhil Deshastha <unk> Brahman <unk> Mandal ( A. D. R. B. M. ) which is located in Mumbai . The activities of <unk> includes offering scholarships to needy students , financial aid to members , exchange of information , and Matrimonial services . The Deshastha community organizations are also affiliated to their respective local All Brahmin Umbrella Organizations . Similar to the Rigvedi community , there are organizations and trusts dedicated to the welfare of the Yajurvedi sub @-@ caste . , 
 = = Surnames and families = = 
 A large number of Deshastha surnames are derived by adding the suffix kar to the village from which the family originally hailed . For example , <unk> came from town of Bid , <unk> comes from the city Nagpur , <unk> from the town of Dharwad in Karnataka , and the Marathi poet V. V. <unk> , colloquially knows as <unk> , came from the town of <unk> . The names Kulkarni , Deshpande , and Joshi are very common amongst Deshastha Brahmins , and denote their professions . For example , Kulkarni means revenue collector and Joshi means astrologer . Some surnames simply describe physical and mental characteristics such as <unk> which means green or <unk> which literally translates to ocean of intellect or " <unk> " which means " very religious " . 
 = 2003 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 2003 Atlantic hurricane season was an active Atlantic hurricane season with tropical activity before and after the official bounds of the season – the first such occurrence in 50 years . The season produced 21 tropical cyclones , of which 16 developed into named storms ; seven cyclones attained hurricane status , of which three reached major hurricane status . With sixteen storms , the season was tied for the sixth most active Atlantic hurricane season on record . The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Isabel , which reached Category 5 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale northeast of the Lesser Antilles ; Isabel later struck North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane , causing $ 3 @.@ 6 billion in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 4 @.@ 63 billion 2016 USD ) and a total of 51 deaths across the Mid @-@ Atlantic region of the United States . 
 The season began with Subtropical Storm Ana on April 20 , prior to the official start of the season ; the bounds of the season are from June 1 to November 30 , which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . In early September , Hurricane Fabian struck Bermuda as a Category 3 hurricane , where it was the worst hurricane since 1926 ; on the island it caused four deaths and $ 300 million in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 386 million 2016 USD ) . Hurricane Juan caused considerable destruction to Nova Scotia , particularly Halifax , as a Category 2 hurricane , the first hurricane of significant strength to hit the province since 1893 . Additionally , Hurricanes Claudette and Erika struck Texas and Mexico , respectively , as minimal hurricanes .

 = = = Pre @-@ season outlook = = = 
 On May 19 , prior to the start of the season , NOAA forecasters issued a 55 % probability of above normal activity . The forecasters predicted 11 – 15 tropical storms , 6 – 9 of those becoming hurricanes , and 2 – 4 of those hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 strength on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . The above normal activity predicted was due to the likelihood of La Niña developing in the season . 
 Noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray on April 4 predicted twelve named storms , with eight reaching hurricane strength and three of the eight reaching Category 3 strength . The prediction issued on May 30 was similar , increasing the named storms to fourteen . The synoptic pattern of the season prior to June 1 resembled other previous seasons , with the 1952 , 1954 , 1964 , 1966 , and 1998 seasons considered the best analogs for the season . The prediction also included a 68 % probability for a hurricane landfall along the United States . 
 = = = Mid @-@ season outlook = = = 
 On August 6 , Dr. Gray announced he had maintained his previous prediction ; with an active start of the season , the rest of the season was forecast to have been only slightly above average , due to an anticipated overall less favorable environment across the Atlantic Ocean . A day later , NOAA released an updated prediction as well , with a 60 % probability of above normal activity , with 12 – 15 named storms , 7 – 9 hurricanes , and 3 – 4 major hurricanes expected . 
 A normal season , as defined by NOAA , has 6 – 14 tropical storms , 4 – 8 of which reach hurricane strength , and 1 – 3 of those reaching Category 3 strength . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = April through July = = = 
 The official beginning of the season was on June 1 , 2003 , though Subtropical Storm Ana formed on April 20 , well before the start to the season . When Ana transitioned into a tropical cyclone the next day , it became the first Atlantic tropical storm on record in the month of April . The storm caused two deaths in Florida from increased waves and rip currents . 
 Starting at the official start of the season , the National Hurricane Center began issuing five @-@ day forecasts , extending from the three @-@ day forecasts issued since 1964 . Officials conducted tests during the previous two seasons , indicating the new five @-@ day forecasts would be as accurate as the three @-@ day forecasts were 15 years earlier . The tropics were active and well ahead of climatology in the early portion of the season , with the seventh tropical depression forming by the end of July . 
 Within the first week of the official start of the season , a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa , and on June 11 developed into Tropical Depression Two ; unfavorable conditions prevailed , and it dissipated within 24 hours of developing . 
 By the end of June , the third tropical depression of the season developed near the Yucatán Peninsula ; it tracked northward , strengthening into Tropical Storm Bill before striking the southern Louisiana coast on June 30 . The storm caused moderate rainfall and a tornado outbreak across the southern United States , resulting in four deaths and $ 30 million in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 38 @.@ 6 million 2016 USD ) . 
 On July 8 , a well @-@ organized tropical wave in the Caribbean Sea organized into Tropical Storm Claudette . Its intensity fluctuated while crossing the basin , attaining hurricane status before weakening and striking the Yucatán Peninsula as a tropical storm . Claudette re @-@ intensified to hurricane status and struck southeastern Texas on July 15 , causing a total of three deaths , one of which directly , and $ 180 million in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 232 million 2016 USD ) . 
 Hurricane Danny formed on July 16 from a tropical wave well to the east of Bermuda . It strengthened while tracking around an anticyclone , and attained hurricane status further north than any other Atlantic tropical cyclone in July . It turned to the east and dissipated without affecting land . 
 Tropical Depression Six developed on July 19 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean , and was initially forecast to attain hurricane status . However , it tracked quickly westward , and degenerated into an open tropical wave on July 21 near the Lesser Antilles . 
 The tropical wave that spawned the previous tropical depression developed an area of convection further to the north , which organized into Tropical Depression Seven on July 25 off the coast of Florida . It failed to develop , and made landfall on Georgia as a tropical depression before dissipating on July 27 . 
 = = = August = = = 
 After a short respite in activity , a westward @-@ moving tropical disturbance organized near Florida and developed into Tropical Storm Erika in the Gulf of Mexico on August 14 . It continued quickly across the body of water , and made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas as a hurricane on August 17 . The hurricane caused two deaths from floodwater drowning in Mexico , as well as minor damage in southern Texas . 
 Tropical Depression Nine formed on August 21 in the eastern Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave . Despite predictions of it intensifying to a strong tropical storm , it failed to strengthen due to strong wind shear , and on August 22 the depression dissipated . 
 Hurricane Fabian developed from a tropical wave on August 27 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean . Tracking west @-@ northwestward around the subtropical ridge , it encountered favorable conditions , and steadily intensified to reach peak winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) on September 1 . Fabian turned to the north and gradually weakened , passing just west of Bermuda on September 5 as a major hurricane . On September 8 , it became an extratropical cyclone after causing four deaths and $ 300 million ( 2003 USD , $ 386 million 2016 USD ) in damage on Bermuda ; there , it was considered the worst hurricane in nearly 80 years . Elsewhere , rough waves from the hurricane killed a surfer in North Carolina and three fishermen off Newfoundland . 
 A tropical disturbance organized into Tropical Storm Grace in the Gulf of Mexico on August 30 ; with a nearby upper @-@ level low causing unfavorable wind shear , the storm failed to organize significantly , and it moved ashore along Texas . The storm dropped moderate rainfall across much of the southern United States . 
 = = = September = = = 
 Tropical Storm Henri formed in the Gulf of Mexico on September 3 , and it crossed central Florida without causing significant damage or flooding . On September 8 it degenerated into a remnant low pressure area , which dropped heavy rainfall in the Mid @-@ Atlantic States . Flooding from the storm 's remnants caused about $ 19 @.@ 6 million in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 25 @.@ 2 million 2016 USD ) , which was compounded by the effects of Hurricane Isabel a week later . 
 A tropical wave spawned Hurricane Isabel on September 6 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean . Encountering favorable conditions , it gradually intensified while tracking generally west @-@ northwestward , and on September 11 Isabel attained peak winds of 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) , the strongest storm of the season . After fluctuating in intensity for the subsequent four days , it weakened and struck North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale . Across the East Coast of the United States , Isabel caused a total of 51 fatalities and $ 3 @.@ 6 billion in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 4 @.@ 63 billion 2016 USD ) . 
 Brief Tropical Depression Fourteen formed on September 8 just off the coast of Africa . An upper @-@ level low hindered its development and changed its motion to the north @-@ northwest , and on September 10 the depression dissipated after passing near the Cape Verde islands . 
 On September 24 a tropical depression developed southeast of Bermuda , and while tracking northward it quickly intensified to become Hurricane Juan . Juan maintained its strength as it accelerated northward , and on September 29 it struck Halifax , Nova Scotia with winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . The hurricane caused a total of 8 fatalities , as well as $ 150 million in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 193 million 2016 USD ) . It was considered one of the worst hurricanes on modern record in Halifax . 
 A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on September 25 , which tracked northwestward before turning to the northeast and becoming Hurricane Kate . The hurricane then turned sharply westward , reaching major hurricane status before turning northward and becoming extratropical on October 7 . It did not have a significant effect on land . 
 = = = October through December = = = 
 An extratropical storm formed in the Bay of Campeche on September 30 , and remaining nearly stationary it transitioned into Tropical Storm Larry by October 1 . The storm drifted southward , reaching peak winds of 65 mph ( 100 mph ) before moving ashore along the Mexican state of Tabasco . Larry caused five deaths in Mexico , as well as heavy rainfall and mudslides . 
 On October 10 , a tropical disturbance organized into Tropical Storm Mindy just off the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic . After moving northwestward , it turned sharply eastward and dissipated on October 14 , after earlier dropping light to moderate rainfall across the Greater Antilles . 
 Tropical Storm Nicholas developed from a tropical wave on October 13 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean . The storm strengthened to near @-@ hurricane intensity before weakening while turning northward and later to the northwest . On October 24 , Nicholas transitioned into an extratropical low , which , after executing an anticyclonic loop , meandered erratically before being absorbed by a non @-@ tropical low to the southwest of Bermuda on November 1 . 
 Early in November , the system that absorbed Nicholas tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean , nearly developing into a subtropical cyclone before crossing Florida and dissipating on November 5 . The season officially ended on November 30 , 2003 , although Tropical Storm Odette formed on December 4 to the northwest of Colombia from a tropical disturbance ; it became the second December tropical storm on record to form in the Caribbean Sea , after a hurricane in 1822 . 
 The final storm of the season , Tropical Storm Peter , formed on December 7 in the eastern Atlantic Ocean . It strengthened to near hurricane status , but rapidly weakened due to increased wind shear and dissipated on December 11 . 
 = = Impact and records = = 
 No cyclones in the season had a significant impact on South America or Central America . However , a total of eight tropical cyclones made landfall on Mexico from either the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean , which was the greatest total since the record of nine in 1971 . A total of seven deaths occurred in Mexico from Atlantic hurricanes . Much of the Caribbean did not receive significant impact from tropical cyclones during the season . However , Tropical Storm Odette caused eight direct deaths , as well as two indirect deaths , when it crossed the Dominican Republic in December . The storm damaged or destroyed over 1 @,@ 000 homes , and heavy damage was reported to the banana crop . 
 Six tropical cyclones made landfall along the coast of the United States during the season , including two hurricanes . The first , Claudette , caused locally heavy damage in southeastern Texas in July ; two deaths were reported in the state , while earlier in its duration it caused an indirect death from rough waves in Florida . In September , Hurricane Isabel caused deaths and damage from North Carolina through southern Canada . The worst damage from the hurricane occurred in Virginia , where it was the costliest disaster in the history of the state ; there , damage totaled $ 1 @.@ 85 billion ( 2003 USD , $ 2 @.@ 38 billion 2016 USD ) , and there were 32 fatalities , ten of which were caused directly by the hurricane . Hurricane Isabel caused deaths in seven states and one Canadian province , and about 6 million people were left without power as a result of the storm . 
 Several cyclones impacted Bermuda during the season , most significantly Hurricane Fabian . On the island , its passage proved to be the costliest and resulted in the first death since a hurricane in 1926 . The hurricane killed four on the island when its strong waves and storm surge washed two cars off the causeway between St. George 's Parish and St. David 's Island . Damage from the hurricane totaled $ 300 million ( 2003 USD , $ 386 million 2016 USD ) . Elsewhere , Hurricane Juan was considered among the most damaging in the history of Halifax , Nova Scotia , where strong winds downed thousands of trees and left low @-@ lying areas flooded from a record storm surge to the city . The hurricane caused a total of eight deaths and damage estimated at $ 200 million ( 2003 CAD , $ 150 million 2003 USD , $ 193 million 2016 USD ) . 
 The season is one of only six with a storm before and after the official bounds of the season ; the others are 1887 , 1951 , 1953 , 1954 and 2007 . When Tropical Storm Peter formed on December 7 , the season became the second on record with two December storms . The 235 days between the development of the first storm , Tropical Storm Ana , and the dissipation of the last storm , Peter , made the 2003 season the longest season since 1952 . The season was the eighth most active on record , behind the 2005 , 1933 , 2012 , 2011 , 2010 , 1995 , 1887 , and 1969 seasons , and tied with the 1936 and 2008 seasons .

 = Sandown Castle , Isle of Wight = 
 Sandown Castle was a Device Fort built at Sandown on the Isle of Wight by Henry VIII in 1545 to protect against the threat of French attack . Constructed from stone with angular bastions , its design was a hybrid of Italian military architectural thinking with traditional English military design . The site was raided by a French force that summer while the fortification was still being constructed . The site suffered from coastal erosion and the castle was demolished in 1631 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 16th century = = = 
 = = = = Background = = = = 
 Sandown Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities , only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Modest defences , based around simple blockhouses and towers , existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale . 
 In 1533 , Henry then broke with Pope Paul III to annul the long @-@ standing marriage to his wife , Catherine of Aragon and remarry . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . Henry responded in 1539 by ordering , through an instruction called a " device " , the construction of fortifications along the most vulnerable parts of the coast . The immediate threat passed , but resurfaced in 1544 , with France threatening an invasion across the Channel , backed by her allies in Scotland . Henry therefore issued another device in 1544 to further improve the country 's defences , particularly along the south coast . 
 = = = = Construction = = = = 
 Built between April and September 1545 to protect the south @-@ east coast of the Isle of Wight , Sandown Castle overlooked Sandown Bay . It was constructed by the Italian engineer Giovanni Portinari , the surveyor William Ridgeway and the captain of labourers , John <unk> , at a cost of £ 2 @,@ 400 . Designed around a central courtyard , it had a square tower and two angular bastions on one side , and a circular bastion looking out to sea . The rear of the stone defences was protected by a moat , and the castle had a wooden pier for boats to dock at . 
 The angular bastions echoed contemporary Italian thinking on military architecture , and may have been influenced by Richard Lee , the King 's Surveyor of Works , as well as by Portinari 's own continental background . Despite being relatively advanced for an English fortification , the castle did not feature the more fashionable Italianate " arrow @-@ head " bastion design used at nearby Yarmouth Castle and has been critiqued by historians : Andrew Saunders describes it as an imperfect " hybrid " of English and continental ideas , John Hale as a timid , confused flirtation with modern designs . 
 Before the castle could be completed , however , the French attacked . Admiral Claude d 'Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July , where the local authorities feared Sandown Castle might be the target of a night attack . 2 @,@ 000 French soldiers men landed on the Isle of Wight and attacked Sandown , where labourers were still present . Their advance soon stalled , however , and the French retreated back to their fleet , bringing the invasion threat to an end ; the castle was finally completed after their departure . 
 = = = 17th century = = = 
 By the 17th century , coastal erosion had undermined the castle 's walls . In 1627 , Charles I announced that he would repair the fortification but instead the ruins were dismantled in 1631 by Sir John Oglander . A new fortification , Sandown Fort was built in its place , positioned further inland , but the possible remains of the foundations of the original castle are still visible along the shore at low tide . 
 = Congregation ( album ) = 
 Congregation is the third studio album by American alternative rock band The Afghan Whigs , released on January 31 , 1992 , by Sub Pop . After touring for two years in support of their 1990 album Up in It , the band received $ 15 @,@ 000 advance from Sub Pop to record a follow @-@ up album . It was primarily recorded at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville and Buzz 's Kitchen in Los Angeles during July to August 1991 . The band 's frontman Greg Dulli produced the album entirely with audio engineer Ross Ian Stein . The album 's production and release were hindered by Sub Pop 's financial difficulties , which were eventually resolved by the massive commercial success of Nirvana 's 1991 album Nevermind . 
 Expanding on the aggressive sound of the band 's previous work , Congregation has more refined musical details and slower songs such as ballads . Its music also incorporates R & B , soul , and funk influences . The album 's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white baby in her arms and alludes comically to the band 's African @-@ American music influences . The songs have themes of pleasure and guilt , and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy . Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene , the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music . 
 Upon its release , Congregation was very well received by music critics , who praised its musical quality , stylistic elements , and emotional content . It was promoted with two singles , " Turn On the Water " and " Conjure Me " , and The Afghan Whigs ' extensive touring in the United States and Europe . Although it did not chart , the album helped the band attain a cult following and receive offers from major record labels , leading to their signing to Elektra Records . Since its initial reception , Congregation has been viewed by writers as the band 's breakthrough album and a significant release in rock music during the 1990s .

 After forming in 1986 in Cincinnati , The Afghan Whigs — vocalist and rhythm guitarist Greg Dulli , bassist John Curley , lead guitarist Rick McCollum , and drummer Steve Earle — released their 1988 debut album Big Top Halloween on an independent record label and gained the attention of Seattle @-@ based label Sub Pop . With their second album Up in It ( 1990 ) released on the label , the band toured regularly in the United States for two years and occasionally in Europe before recording Congregation . Sub Pop gave the band a $ 15 @,@ 000 advance to record the album , which Dulli later said was a " then @-@ unheard @-@ of " and " bloated " amount . 
 The album 's cover shows a nude black woman sitting on a blanket with a white baby held in her arms . It serves as a comical reference to the band 's African @-@ American music roots . Along with a collective interest in classic rock , band members had other individual tastes in music , including McCollum 's interest in free jazz , experimental , and Indian music , and Dulli 's love of hip hop , soul , and funk , particularly Motown artists and Prince . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The Afghan Whigs began recording the album in July 1991 . They held recording sessions for Congregation at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville , Washington and Buzz 's Kitchen in Los Angeles , California . Dulli wrote most of its songs and produced the album with audio engineer Ross Ian Stein . Session musicians such as Miss Ruby Belle , Shecky Stein , and Lance Ellison also contributed ; Belle sung lead vocals on " Her Against Me " , Stein played piano on " Conjure Me " , and Ellison played piano and sung lead vocals on " The Temple " with John Curley and Rick McCollum . Singer @-@ songwriter Shawn Smith contributed backing vocals to " This Is My Confession " and " <unk> It " . After the rest of the band finished recording their parts , Dulli stayed in Los Angeles to record his vocals , overdub the recorded tracks , and mix the album . However , the album 's production was delayed due to Sub Pop 's financial difficulties , and Dulli got another job in Los Angeles to pay for the studio . 
 Although the label eventually settled the studio 's bills and the album 's sessions ended in August 1991 , the band was unsure if Sub Pop had enough money to release any more albums , let alone Congregation . After the massive commercial success of Nirvana 's 1991 album Nevermind , Sub Pop recovered financially by receiving royalties from the album after the band left them for a major label . Dulli later said that while he was " stranded in L.A. ... Nirvana saved the whole fuckin ' label " . He recalled thanking the band 's frontman Kurt Cobain upon the album 's completion , saying that " I went to Nirvana 's show at the Palace in L.A. and hugged Kurt and said , ' Good one , bro . Congratulations . And thank you — now I can go home . ' " 
 After the album 's sessions were done , Dulli was inspired to write and record an additional track on the day of Miles Davis ' death , September 28 , 1991 . He received two messages on his answering machine from music executive David <unk> , the first providing directions to a cookout and the second informing Dulli that Davis had passed , saying that " Miles is dead . Don 't forget the alcohol . " Working at <unk> in Cincinnati , Dulli incorporated <unk> 's line as a lyric and , with a guitar riff from Rick McCollum , hastily recorded " Miles Iz Ded " , which was included as a hidden track on the album . Congregation was mastered by Jack Skinner at K Disc Mastering in Hollywood . Dulli subsequently took a drive in his car and listened to the album while observing his scenery , a practice he continued with future albums .

 The album expands on the aggressive sound of the band 's previous work with refined musical details and occasionally slower songs . In The Rough Guide to Rock ( 2003 ) , music journalist Alex Ogg writes that The Afghan Whigs were " managing to balance volume with subtlety " amid the burgeoning grunge music scene . The album 's music incorporates heavy counterpoint rhythms , indie rock harmonics , wah @-@ wah and slide guitars , and staccato riffs with funk , metal , and blues influences . Chicago Tribune writer Brad Webber compares its melodies to those of " later Hüsker Dü " . Option perceives influences from " ex @-@ indie guitar bands " such as Dinosaur Jr. and Nirvana in the songs ' " catch @-@ <unk> and in the arrangements ' juxtaposition of frenzy and laziness . " David Sprague of the Trouser Press comments that the band 's instrumentation " <unk> [ es ] panoramic images through judicious use of wah @-@ wah guitar ... and the tribal drumbeats with which Steven Earle invokes an air of ritualistic surrender . " 
 The album 's rock sound is complemented by a predominant soul influence . Magic magazine 's Christophe Basterra characterizes the music as " The Four Tops appropriating ' Search and Destroy ' by Iggy & the Stooges " . The slow @-@ burning ballad " Let Me Lie to You " incorporates soul and grunge musical styles . Dulli wrote the song in an attempt to deviate from the aesthetic of Sub Pop , whom he felt discouraged its acts from recording slow songs . He cites writing the song as the moment he began having faith in himself as a songwriter . Songs such as " Miles Iz Ded " , " Conjure Me " , and " Turn On the Water " incorporate funk influences and wah @-@ wah guitar . Pitchfork Media 's Stephen M. Deusner cites the latter song as an example of how the band " integrate [ d ] African @-@ American sounds and influences into their white rock " , writing that it " uses Isaac Hayes ' <unk> @-@ <unk> guitars as a punk accessory , and its jumpy guitar riffs instill these songs with a sense of motion that suggests amped @-@ up r & b . " " Tonight " features bluesy acoustic guitar . 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 The songs discuss dysfunctional intimate relationships and sexual deviancy , and feature themes of pleasure and guilt . They are narrated from the perspective of a broken sinner and lothario with sinister and narcissistic tones . Dulli 's lyrics incorporate haunting refrains and express angst and melodrama . His baritone vocals are <unk> husky and feature falsetto wails . Daniel Fidler of Spin compares Dulli 's vocals on the album to those of " a young Paul Westerberg in heat . " David Sprague of the Trouser Press calls Congregation a " strangely flamboyant " album that showcases " Dulli 's metamorphosis from <unk> wallflower to rakish scoundrel with a heart of glass . " Jason Ankeny of AllMusic calls Dulli " a truly magnetic presence " and writes of his performance on the album , " by turns predator ( ' Tonight ' ) and prey ( ' I 'm Her Slave ' ) , he 's the guy your parents always warned you about , delivering each syllable of his remarkable lyrics with equal measures of innuendo and venom . " Stephanie Benson of Rhapsody comments that his lyrics are " full of stifling dissatisfaction and boozy philosophy " . 
 " I 'm Her Slave " is a heroin anecdote with lyrics narrated by a subjugate lover . Music critic Greg Kot cites " Turn On the Water " as an example of when " the twisted narrator is the victim " and " cast adrift " in Dulli 's lyrics . Inspired by a paranoid breakup , " Conjure Me " is told from the perspective of an aggressive predator and obscure object of desire . On " Kiss the Floor " , the narrator recounts stealing a girl 's virginity and avoiding her brothers . " This Is My Confession " has a theme of absolution . The lyrics depicts it as an empty sexual experience : " Shove my head against the door , crawl inside and kiss the floor / Waiting for the sun again , drink it , smoke it , stick it in . " " The Temple " is a cover of the song of the same name from the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar . Dulli became a fan of the rock opera as a child when his babysitter played it . " Let Me Lie to You " has lyrics expressing passive cruelty and subtle manipulation . " Tonight " depicts a peaceful night as the backdrop for the narrator 's corrupt one @-@ track mind : " Follow me down to the bushes , dear / No one will know , we 'll disappear / I 'll hold your hand , we 'll never tell / Our private little trip to hell " . The album 's hidden track " Miles Iz Ded " is about seduction and alcohol , with a last call sensibility and despairing tone .

 The album was released by Sub Pop on January 31 , 1992 , and distributed by Caroline Records . It was issued on LP and CD formats . Congregation was promoted with two singles . " Turn On the Water " was released in January as a 7 @-@ inch single with " Miles Iz Ded " on its B @-@ side . It was also released as a CD single coupled with the tracks " Chalk Outline " and " Miles Iz Ded " . On February 25 , " Turn On the Water " was released as a cassette single . " Conjure Me " was released in May as a 7 @-@ inch single backed with a cover of The Supremes ' 1965 song " My World Is Empty Without You " . A music video for the single was filmed , featuring a topless woman caressing Dulli as he lip syncs the song , and received rotation on MTV . Congregation was reissued in September 1998 . It was released in the United Kingdom on November 22 , 1999 , through PIAS Recordings . 
 The Afghan Whigs promoted the album with an appearance on MTV and an international tour with dates in major American cities and Europe . During their shows , the band interspersed R & B songs in their set list , including an interpolation of The Spinners ' 1972 song " I 'll Be Around " in " Turn On the Water " . Their extensive touring for the album helped the band garner a larger audience . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Although it did not chart , Congregation received very positive reviews from music critics upon its release . Michael Azerrad of Rolling Stone called it " superb " . Daniel Fidler of Spin called the album " a clean move toward musical excellence " and commented that it " shows the band bursting its Sub Pop chains with catchy , heavy guitar riffs , downright lovable song arrangements , melodies that jerk your emotions back and forth , and yes , endearing , raspy vocals that wail , moan , scream , and shout " . Brad Webber of the Chicago Tribune gave it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of four stars and described the album as " a more accessible brand of music than normally associated with the Seattle @-@ Minneapolis axis of grunge guitar groups . " He found The Afghan Whigs to be " on rock 's cutting edge " and commented that the band " stirs a torrent of emotions on neatly paced songs " . 
 J. D. Considine of Musician characterized the band as " clever enough to find hooks in the sort of gnarled riffs and guitar noise Fugazi plays for atmosphere " , as well as " canny enough to avoid most of the mannerisms that make much Amerindie rock seem so cliched . " Considine concluded in his review , " The best reason to join this Congregation is that the songs are catchy enough to hold their own against the best work of bands like Dinosaur Jr. or the Replacements . " In a mixed review , Option commended the album 's " sheer listenability " , " clear recording and dynamic performances " , but criticized Dulli 's subject matter and panned the band 's cover of " The Temple " . Melody Maker ranked the album number 25 on its year @-@ end best albums for 1992 . 
 With the album 's critical acclaim and their steady touring , the band attained a cult following and was courted by several major labels who wanted to sign them . Frustrated with the distribution limitation of a small record label , they signed to Elektra Records after their final release for Sub Pop , an EP of soul cover songs called Uptown Avondale ( 1992 ) . Their major label debut Gentlemen was released in 1993 to critical acclaim and mainstream exposure .

 Along with Gentlemen , Congregation is generally considered by music writers to be part of The Afghan Whigs ' peak era . Dulli cites it as " the record where we came into our own " . Melody Maker dubbed it " the finest rock LP of the decade " and commented that it is " nothing less than rock raping pop , a ferocious <unk> of Motown 's romantic ideal " . With Congregation , Stephanie Benson of Rhapsody found the band to be " crucial to the birth of ' 90s alternative rock . " AllMusic 's Jason Ankeny said that it was the band 's artistic breakthrough and " ticket to the big leagues " . He gave the album four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars in a retrospective review and called it " an incendiary and insidious set which bridges the gap between the noisy aggression of the band 's early releases and the soulful swagger of their later work . " Ankeny also cited it as " the grunge era 's most overlooked masterpiece " and an indication of the band 's musical growth , writing that " while still unmistakably a member of the Sub Pop stable , there 's a greater maturity and depth to their sinewy sound , with a newfound grasp of mood and nuance " . 
 Yahoo ! Music 's Chris Norris called it a " disjointed set , which finds the band suspended between its punky roots and a more voluptuous later style . " The Spin Alternative Record Guide ( 1995 ) noted " a creative musical blend " on the album , but concluded that " the results feel like dress rehearsals for Gentlemen , with one partial exception , ' Conjure Me , ' and one absolute triumph : a surging final track ... that might be the Afghan Whigs ' strongest recorded performance . " In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , Rolling Stone journalist Joe Gross gave the album three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars and viewed it as a " quantum leap " over the band 's previous work , commenting that it " shows that they ditched grunge for soul because they were no damn good at the former and ladies dig the latter . " In 2002 , Italian music magazine Il <unk> <unk> included the album in its list of 100 Best Albums by Decade . Polish webzine <unk> ranked it number 79 on its 2004 list of the Top 100 Albums of the ' 90s .

 = Robert II of Scotland = 
 Robert II ( 2 March 1316 – 19 April 1390 ) reigned as King of Scots from 1371 to his death as the first monarch of the House of Stewart . He was the son of Walter Stewart , 6th High Steward of Scotland and of Marjorie Bruce , daughter of Robert the Bruce and of his first wife Isabella of Mar. 
 Edward Bruce was named heir to the throne but he died without legitimate children on 3 December 1318 in a battle near Dundalk in Ireland . Marjorie by this time had died in a riding accident - probably in 1317 . Parliament decreed her infant son , Robert Stewart , as heir presumptive , but this lapsed on 5 March 1324 on the birth of a son , David , to King Robert and his second wife , Elizabeth de Burgh . Robert Stewart inherited the title of High Steward of Scotland on his father 's death on 9 April 1326 , and a Parliament held in July 1326 confirmed the young Steward as heir should Prince David die without a successor . In 1329 King Robert I died and the six @-@ year @-@ old David succeeded to the throne with Sir Thomas Randolph , Earl of Moray appointed Guardian of Scotland . 
 Edward Balliol , son of King John Balliol , assisted by the English and Scottish nobles disinherited by Robert I , invaded Scotland inflicting heavy defeats on the Bruce party on 11 August 1332 at Dupplin Moor and Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333 . Robert fought at Halidon , where his uncle and former guardian , Sir James Stewart , was killed . Following this battle , Robert 's lands in the west were given by Balliol to his supporter David Strathbogie , the titular Earl of Atholl . Robert took refuge in the fortress of Dumbarton Castle in the Clyde estuary to join his uncle , King David . In May 1334 David escaped to France leaving Robert and John Randolph , 3rd Earl of Moray as joint Guardians of the kingdom . Robert succeeded in regaining his lands but following Randolph 's capture by the English in July 1335 , his possessions were once again targeted by the forces of Balliol and King Edward III of England . This may have persuaded Robert to submit to Balliol and the English king and may explain his removal as Guardian by September 1335 . The Guardianship transferred to Sir Andrew Murray of Bothwell but following his death in 1338 Robert was re @-@ appointed and retained the office until King David returned from France in June 1341 . Robert accompanied David into battle at Neville 's Cross on 17 October 1346 but he and Patrick Dunbar , Earl of March escaped or fled the field and David was taken prisoner . In October 1357 , the king was ransomed for 100 @,@ 000 marks to be paid in installments over ten years . 
 Robert married Elizabeth Mure around 1348 , legitimising his four sons and five daughters . His subsequent marriage to Euphemia de Ross in 1355 produced two sons and two surviving daughters and provided the basis of a future dispute regarding the line of succession . Robert joined a rebellion against David in 1363 but submitted to him following a threat to his right of succession . In 1364 , David presented a proposal to Parliament that would cancel the remaining ransom debt if it was agreed that a Plantagenet heir would inherit the Scottish throne should he die without issue . This was rejected and Robert succeeded to the throne at the age of 55 following David 's unexpected death in 1371 . England still controlled large sectors in the Lothians and in the border country so King Robert allowed his southern earls to engage in actions in the English zones to regain their territories , halted trade with England and renewed treaties with France . By 1384 , the Scots had re @-@ taken most of the occupied lands , but following the commencement of Anglo @-@ French peace talks , Robert was reluctant to commit Scotland to all @-@ out war and obtained Scotland 's inclusion in the peace treaty . Robert 's peace strategy was a factor in the virtual coup in 1384 when he lost control of the country , first to his eldest son , John , Earl of Carrick , afterwards King Robert III , and then from 1388 to John 's younger brother , Robert , Earl of Fife , afterwards the first Duke of Albany . Robert II died in Dundonald Castle in 1390 and was buried at Scone Abbey . 
 = = Heir presumptive = = 
 Robert Stewart , born in 1316 , was the only child of Walter Stewart , High Steward of Scotland and King Robert I 's daughter Marjorie Bruce , who died probably in 1317 following a riding accident . He had the upbringing of a Gaelic noble on the Stewart lands in Bute , Clydeside , and in Renfrew . In 1315 parliament removed Marjorie 's right as heir to her father in favour of her uncle , Edward Bruce . Edward was killed at the Battle of <unk> , near Dundalk on 14 October 1318 , resulting in a hastily arranged Parliament in December to enact a new entail naming Marjorie 's son , Robert , as heir should the king die without a successor . The birth of a son , afterwards David II , to King Robert on 5 March 1324 cancelled Robert Stewart 's position as heir presumptive , but a Parliament at Cambuskenneth in July 1326 restored him in the line of succession should David die without an heir . This reinstatement of his status was accompanied by the gift of lands in Argyll , Roxburghshire and the Lothians .

 = = = Renewed war for independence = = = 
 The first war of independence began in the reign of King John Balliol . His short reign was bedeviled by Edward I 's insistence on his overlordship of Scotland . The Scottish leadership concluded that only war could release the country from the English king 's continued weakening of Balliol 's sovereignty and so finalised a treaty of reciprocal assistance with France in October 1295 . The Scots forayed into England in March 1296 — this incursion together with the French treaty angered the English king and provoked an invasion of Scotland taking Berwick on 30 March before defeating the Scots army at Dunbar on 27 April . John Balliol submitted to Edward and resigned the throne to him before being sent to London as a prisoner . Despite this , resistance to the English led by William Wallace and Andrew Moray had emerged in the name of King John Balliol . On their deaths , Robert the Bruce continued to resist the English and eventually succeeded in defeating the forces of Edward II of England and gained the Scottish throne for himself . 
 David Bruce , aged five , became king on 7 June 1329 on the death of his father Robert . Walter the Steward had died earlier on 9 April 1327 , and the orphaned eleven @-@ year @-@ old Robert was placed under the guardianship of his uncle , Sir James Stewart of <unk> , who along with Thomas Randolph , Earl of Moray , and William Lindsey , Archdeacon of St Andrews were appointed as joint Guardians of the kingdom . David 's accession kindled the second independence war which threatened Robert 's position as heir . In 1332 Edward Balliol , son of the deposed John Balliol , spearheaded an attack on the Bruce sovereignty with the tacit support of King Edward III of England and the explicit endorsement of ' the disinherited ' . Edward Balliol 's forces delivered heavy defeats on the Bruce supporters at Dupplin Moor on 11 August 1332 and again at Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333 , at which the 17 @-@ year @-@ old Robert participated . Robert 's estates were overrun by Balliol , who granted them to David Strathbogie , titular earl of Atholl , but Robert evaded capture and gained protection at Dumbarton Castle where King David was also taking refuge . Very few other strongholds remained in Scottish hands in the winter of 1333 — only the castles of Kildrummy ( held by Christian Bruce , elder sister of Robert I and wife of Andrew Murray of Bothwell ) , Loch Leven , Loch Doon , and Urquhart held out against Balliol forces . 
 In May 1334 , the situation looked dire for the house of Bruce and David II gained safety in France . Robert set about winning back his lands in the west of Scotland . Strathbogie came over to the Bruce interest after disagreements with his fellow ' disinherited ' but his fierce opposition to Randolph came to a head at a Parliament held at <unk> Castle in early 1335 when Strathbogie received the support of Robert . Strathbogie once again changed sides and submitted to the English king in August and was made Warden of Scotland . It seems that Strathbogie may also have persuaded Robert to submit to Edward and Balliol — Sir Thomas Gray , in his <unk> claimed that he had actually done so — and may explain his removal as Guardian around this time . The Bruce resistance to Balliol may have been verging on collapse in 1335 but a turn @-@ round in its fortunes began with the appearance of Sir Andrew Murray of Bothwell as a potent war leader at the Battle of <unk> . Murray had been captured in 1332 , ransomed himself in 1334 , and immediately sped north to lay siege to <unk> Castle in Buchan held by Sir Henry de Beaumont , with the castle falling on 23 December 1334 . Murray was appointed Guardian at Dunfermline during the winter of 1335 – 6 while he was besieging Cupar Castle in Fife . He died at his castle in Avoch in 1338 and Robert resumed the Guardianship . Murray 's campaign put an end to any chance of Edward III having full lasting control over the south of Scotland and Edward 's failure in the six @-@ month siege of Dunbar Castle confirmed this . Balliol lost many of his major supporters to the Bruce side and the main English garrisons began to fall to the Scots — Cupar in the spring or summer of 1339 , Perth taken by Robert also in 1339 and Edinburgh by William , Earl of Douglas in April 1341 . 
 John Randolph , released from English custody in a prisoner @-@ exchange in 1341 , visited David II in Normandy before returning to Scotland . Just as Randolph was a favourite of the king , David II mistrusted Robert Stewart with his powerful positions of heir presumptive and Guardian of Scotland . At the beginning of June 1341 , the kingdom appeared sufficiently stable to allow the king to return to a land where his nobles , while fighting for the Bruce cause , had considerably increased their own power bases . On 17 October 1346 , Robert accompanied David into battle at Neville 's Cross , where many Scottish nobles including Randolph , died — David II was wounded and captured while Robert and Patrick , earl of March had apparently fled the field . 
 = = = King David 's captivity = = = 
 With the king now imprisoned in England and Randolph dead , the Guardianship once again fell to Robert . In 1347 he took the important step of ensuring the legitimation of his four sons , John , Earl of Carrick ( the future King Robert III ) , Walter , Lord of Fife ( d . 1362 ) , Robert ( the future Duke of Albany ) and Alexander , Lord of Badenoch ( and future Earl of Buchan ) , and six daughters by petitioning Pope Clement VI to allow a canon law marriage to Elizabeth Mure . 
 Even though an English prisoner , David retained influence in Scotland and Robert had his Guardianship removed by parliament and given jointly to the earls of Mar and Ross and the lord of Douglas — this did not last and Robert was once again appointed Guardian by the Parliament of February 1352 . The paroled David attended this Parliament to present to Robert and the members of the Three Estates the conditions for his release . These contained no ransom demand , but required the Scots to name the English prince John of Gaunt as heir presumptive . The Council rejected these terms , with Robert opposed to a proposal that threatened his right of succession . The king had no option but to return to captivity — the English chronicler Henry Knighton wrote of the event : 
 ... the Scots refused to have their King unless he entirely renounced the influence of the English , and similarly refused to submit themselves to them . And they warned him that they would neither ransom him nor allow him to be ransomed unless he pardoned them for all their acts and injuries that they had done , and all the offences that they had committed during the time of captivity , and he should give them security for that , or otherwise they threatened to choose another king to rule them . 
 By 1354 ongoing negotiations for the king 's release reached the stage where a proposal of a straight ransom payment of 90 @,@ 000 marks to be repaid over nine years , guaranteed by the provision of 20 high @-@ ranking hostages , was agreed — this understanding was destroyed by Robert when he bound the Scots to a French action against the English in 1355 . The capture of Berwick together with the presence of the French on English soil jolted Edward III into moving against the Scots — in January 1356 Edward led his forces into the south @-@ east of Scotland and burned Edinburgh and Haddington and much of the Lothians in a campaign that became known as the ' Burnt Candlemas ' . After Edward 's victory over France in September , the Scots resumed negotiations for David 's release ending in October 1357 with the Treaty of Berwick . Its terms were that in turn for David 's freedom , a ransom of 100 @,@ 000 marks would be paid in annual installments over ten years — only the first two payments were completed initially and nothing further until 1366 . This failure to honour the conditions of the Berwick treaty allowed Edward to continue to press for a Plantagenet successor to David — terms that were totally rejected by the Scottish Council and probably by Robert himself . This may have been the cause of a brief rebellion in 1363 by Robert and the earls of Douglas and March . Later French inducements couldn 't bring David to their aid and the country remained at peace with England until he unexpectedly died on 21 February 1371 . 
 = = King of Scots = = 
 = = = Consolidation of Stewart power and personal rule = = = 
 David was buried at Holyrood Abbey almost immediately but an armed protest by William , Earl of Douglas delayed Robert II 's coronation until 26 March 1371 . The reasons for the incident remain unclear but may have involved a dispute regarding Robert 's right of succession , or may have been directed against George Dunbar , Earl of March and the southern Justiciar , Robert Erskine . It was resolved by Robert giving his daughter Isabella in marriage to Douglas 's son , James and with Douglas replacing Erskine as Justiciar south of the Forth . Robert 's accession did affect some others who held offices from David II . In particular , George Dunbar 's brother John Dunbar , the Lord of Fife who lost his claim on Fife and Sir Robert Erskine 's son , Sir Thomas Erskine who lost control of Edinburgh Castle . 
 The Stewarts greatly increased their holdings in the west , in Atholl , and in the far north : the earldoms of Fife and Menteith went to Robert II 's second surviving son Robert , the earldoms of Buchan and Ross ( along with the lordship of Badenoch ) to his fourth son Alexander and the earldoms of Strathearn and Caithness to the eldest son of his second marriage , David . Importantly , King Robert 's sons @-@ in @-@ law were John MacDonald , Lord of the Isles , John Dunbar , Earl of Moray and James who would become the 2nd Earl of Douglas . Robert 's sons , John , Earl of Carrick , the king 's heir , and Robert , Earl of Fife , were made keepers of the castles of Edinburgh and Stirling respectively , while Alexander , Lord of Badenoch and Ross , and afterwards Earl of Buchan , became the king 's Justiciar and lieutenant in the north of the Kingdom . This build @-@ up of the Stewart family power did not appear to cause resentment among the senior magnates — the king generally did not threaten their territories or local rule and where titles were transferred to his sons the individuals affected were usually very well rewarded . This style of kingship was very different from his predecessor 's — David tried to dominate his nobles whereas Robert 's strategy was to delegate authority to his powerful sons and earls and this generally worked for the first decade of his reign . Robert II was to have influence over eight of the fifteen earldoms either through his sons directly or by strategic marriages of his daughters to powerful lords . 
 In 1373 , Robert ensured the future security of the Stewart dynasty by having Parliament pass <unk> regarding the succession . At this time , none of his sons had heirs so it became necessary for a system to be devised to define precisely the circumstances in which each of his sons could inherit the crown — none of this would take precedence over normal succession by <unk> . By 1375 , the king had commissioned John Barbour to write the poem , The Brus , a history intended to bolster the public image of the Stewarts as the genuine heirs of Robert I. It described the patriotic acts of both Sir James , the Black Douglas and Walter the Steward , the king 's father , in their support of Bruce . Robert II 's rule during the 1370s saw the country 's finances stabilised and greatly improved due in part to the flourishing wool trade , reduced calls on the public purse and by the halting of his predecessor 's ransom money on the death of Edward III of England . Robert II — unlike David II whose kingship was predominantly Lothian and therefore lowland based — did not restrict his attention to one sector of his kingdom but frequently visited the more remote areas of the north and west among his Gaelic lords . 
 Robert II ruled over a country that continued to have English enclaves within its borders and Scots who gave their allegiance to the king of England — the important castles of Berwick , Jedburgh , Lochmaben and Roxburgh had English garrisons and controlled southern Berwickshire , Teviotdale and large areas in Annandale and Tweeddale . In June 1371 , Robert agreed to a defensive treaty with the French , and although there were no outright hostilities during 1372 , the English garrisons were reinforced and placed under an increased state of vigilance . Attacks on the English held zones , with the near @-@ certain backing of Robert , began in 1373 and accelerated in the years 1375 – 7 . This indicated that a central decision had probably been taken for the escalation of conflict rather than the previous small @-@ scale marauding attacks by the border barons . In 1376 , the Earl of March successfully recovered Annandale , but then found himself constrained by the Bruges Anglo @-@ French truce . 
 In his dealings with Edward III , Robert blamed his border magnates for the escalating attacks on the English zones , but regardless of this the Scots retained the recaptured lands , which were often portioned out among minor lords , so securing their interest in preventing English re @-@ possession . Despite Robert 's further condemnations of his border lords , all the signs were that Robert backed the growing successful Scottish militancy following Edward III 's death in 1377 . In a charter dated 25 July 1378 the king decreed that Coldingham Priory would no longer be a daughter house of the English Durham Priory but was to be attached to Dunfermline Abbey . In early February the Scots — apparently unaware of the conclusion of an Anglo @-@ French truce on 26 January 1384 that included the Scots in the cease @-@ fire — conducted an all @-@ out attack on the English zones winning back Lochmaben Castle and Teviotdale . John of Gaunt led a reciprocal English attack that took him as far as Edinburgh , where he was bought off by the burgesses , but destroyed Haddington . Carrick and James , Earl of Douglas ( his father William had died in April ) , wanted a retaliatory strike for the Gaunt raid . Robert may have concluded that as the French had reneged on a previous agreement to send assistance in 1383 and then having entered into a truce with England , that any military action would have been met with retaliation and exclusion from the forthcoming Boulogne peace talks . On 2 June 1384 , Robert resolved to send Walter Wardlaw , Bishop of Glasgow to the Anglo @-@ French peace talks , yet Carrick ignored this and allowed raids into the north of England to take place . Despite this , by 26 July , the Scots were part of the truce that would expire in October . Robert called a Council in September , probably for working out how to proceed when the truce concluded , and to decide how the war was to proceed thereafter . 
 = = = Loss of authority and death = = = 
 Robert 's son , John , Earl of Carrick , had become the foremost Stewart magnate south of the Forth just as Alexander , Earl of Buchan was in the north . Alexander 's activities and methods of royal administration , enforced by Gaelic mercenaries , drew criticism from northern earls and bishops and from his younger half @-@ brother David , Earl of Strathearn . These complaints damaged the king 's standing within the Council leading to criticism of his ability to curb Buchan 's activities . Robert 's differences with the Carrick affinity regarding the conduct of the war and his continued failure or unwillingness to deal with Buchan in the north led to the political convulsion of November 1384 when the Council removed the king 's authority to govern and appointed Carrick as lieutenant of the kingdom — a coup d ’ état had taken place . With Robert sidelined , there was now no impediment in the way of war . In June 1385 , a force of 1200 French soldiers joined the Scots in a campaign that involved the Earl of Douglas and two of Robert 's sons , John , Earl of Carrick and Robert , Earl of Fife . The skirmishes saw small gains but a quarrel between the French and Scottish commanders saw the abandonment of an attack on the important castle of Roxburgh . 
 The victory of the Scots over the English at the Battle of Otterburn in Northumberland in August 1388 set in motion Carrick 's fall from power . One of the Scottish casualties was Carrick 's close ally James , Earl of Douglas . Douglas died without an heir , which led to various claims upon the title and estate — Carrick backed Malcolm Drummond , the husband of Douglas 's sister , while Fife sided with the successful appellant , Sir Archibald Douglas , lord of Galloway who possessed an entail on the Douglas estates . Fife , now with his powerful Douglas ally , and those who supported the king ensured a countercoup at the December Council meeting when the guardianship of Scotland passed from Carrick ( who had recently been badly injured from a horse @-@ kick ) to Fife . Many had also approved of Fife 's intention to properly resolve the situation of lawlessness in the north and in particular the activities of his younger brother , Buchan . Fife relieved Buchan of his offices of lieutenant of the north and justiciar north of the Forth . The latter role was given to Fife 's son , Murdoch Stewart . Robert II toured the north @-@ east of the kingdom in late January 1390 , perhaps to reinforce the changed political scene in the north following Buchan 's removal from authority . In March , Robert returned to Dundonald Castle in Ayrshire where he died on 19 April and was buried at Scone on 25 April . 
 = = Historiography = = 
 The reign of Robert II has undergone a re @-@ appraisal since the works of historians Gordon Donaldson ( 1967 ) and Ranald Nicholson ( 1974 ) . Donaldson admits to a paucity of knowledge ( at the time that he was writing ) regarding Robert 's reign and accepts that the early chroniclers writing near to his reign found little to criticise . Robert 's career before and after he succeeded to the throne is described by Donaldson as " to say the least , undistinguished , and his reign did nothing to add lustre to it . " Donaldson goes further and debates the legality of the canon law marriage of Robert and Elizabeth Mure following the papal dispensation , but acknowledges that the Acts of Succession in 1371 and 1372 , although sealing the matter in the eyes of Parliament , did not end the generational feud of the descendants of Elizabeth Mure and of Euphemia Ross . Robert 's earlier participation in combat at the battles of Halidon and Neville 's Cross , according to Donaldson , had made him wary of sanctioning military expeditions against the English and that any such actions by his barons were concealed from him . Similarly , Nicholson described Robert 's reign as deficient and that his lack of the skills of governance led to internal strife . Nicholson asserts that the Earl of Douglas was bought off following his armed demonstration just before Robert 's coronation , and associates this with the doubt surrounding the legitimacy of Robert 's sons with Elizabeth Mure . 
 In contrast , the historians Stephen Boardman ( 2007 ) , Alexander Grant ( 1984 & 1992 ) and Michael Lynch ( 1992 ) give a more even @-@ handed appraisal of Robert II 's life . Modern historians show a kingdom that had become wealthier and more stable particularly during the first decade of his rule . Boardman explains that Robert II was subjected to negative propaganda while he was High Steward — David II 's followers denigrated his conduct during his <unk> and described them as " tyranny " — and again later as king when the supporters of his son John , Earl of Carrick said that Robert was a king lacking drive and accomplishments , weighed down by age and unfit to govern . Robert II 's association with Gaelic Scotland also drew criticism . He grew up in his ancestral lands in the west and was completely at ease with the Gaelic language and culture and possessed a potent relationship with the Gaelic lords in the Hebrides , upper Perthshire and Argyll . Throughout his reign , Robert spent long periods in his Gaelic heartlands and complaints at the time in Lowland Scotland seem to have been influenced by the view that the king was too much involved in Gaelic concerns . Boardman also asserts that much of the negative views held of Robert II find their origins in the writings of the French chronicler Jean Froissart who recorded that ' [ the king ] had red <unk> eyes , of the colour of sandalwood , which clearly showed that he was no valiant man , but one who would remain at home than march to the field ' . Contrary to Froissart 's view , the early Scottish chroniclers — Andrew of Wyntoun and Walter Bower ( who both utilised a source that was nearly contemporary with Robert II ) — and later 15th and 16th century Scottish chroniclers and poets showed ' Robert II as a Scottish patriotic hero , a defender of the integrity of the Scottish kingdom , and as the direct heir to Robert I ' . 
 Grant ( 1992 ) acknowledges that Robert II 's reign in terms of foreign and domestic policy was " not so unsuccessful " . As far as William , Earl of Douglas 's reaction was concerned when he staged an armed demonstration before Robert 's coronation , Grant does not hold to the view that Douglas was in some way demonstrating against Robert 's legitimate right to the throne , but more an assertion that royal patronage should not continue as in the time of David II . Grant also advocates that the demonstration was aimed at father and son Robert and Thomas Erskine , who held the castles of Edinburgh , Stirling and Dumbarton from Robert 's predecessor . Grant seriously called into question the dependability of Froissart 's writings as an effective source for Robert II 's reign . Influential magnate coalitions headed by Carrick , having undermined the king 's position , manipulated the Council of November 1384 to effectively oust Robert II from any real power . Grant gives little weight to the asserted senility of Robert , and suggests that the deposition of Carrick in 1388 , and then the resolution to join the Anglo @-@ French truce of 1389 , were both at the instigation of Robert II . Yet power was not handed back to Robert II but to Carrick 's younger brother , Robert , earl of Fife which once again saw the king at the disposition of one of his sons . Despite this , the now unknown source whom both Wyntoun and Bower relied on made the point that Fife deferred to his father on affairs of state emphasising the difference in styles in the <unk> of his two sons . 
 Michael Lynch points out that Robert II 's reign from 1371 until the lieutenancy of Carrick in 1384 had been one exemplified by continued prosperity and stability - a time which Abbot Bower described as a period of " tranquility , prosperity and peace " . Lynch suggests that the troubles of the 1450s between James II and the Douglases ( which some historians have interpreted as the legacy of Robert II 's policy of encouraging powerful lordships ) , was in fact a continuation of David II 's build @-@ up of local lords in the Marches and Galloway — Robert was satisfied with government to leave alone the Douglas and the Stewart earls in their fiefdoms . The weakening of government if anything , Lynch suggests , came not before the 1384 coup but after it , despite the fact that the coup had at its root Robert II 's favouring of his third son , Alexander Stewart , Earl of Buchan ( known as the Wolf of Badenoch ) .

 Robert II has been depicted in historical novels . They include : 
 The Three Perils of Man ; or , War , women , and witchcraft ( 1822 ) by James Hogg . The tale takes place in the reign of Robert II whose " country enjoyed happiness and peace , all save a part adjoining to the borders of England . " Part of the action takes place at Linlithgow Palace , where Robert promises to marry his daughter Margaret Stewart " to the knight who shall take that castle of Roxburgh out of the hands of the English " . With Margaret adding her own terms , that " in case of his attempting and failing in the undertaking , he shall forfeit all his lands , castles , towns , and towers to me . " In the absence of volunteers , Margaret vows to take the Castle herself , defeating Lord Musgrave and his mistress Jane Howard .

 = Neil Armstrong = 
 Neil Alden Armstrong ( August 5 , 1930 – August 25 , 2012 ) was an American astronaut and the first person to walk on the Moon . He was also an aerospace engineer , naval aviator , test pilot , and university professor . Before becoming an astronaut , Armstrong was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War . After the war , he earned his bachelor 's degree at Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) High @-@ Speed Flight Station , where he logged over 900 flights . He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California . 
 A participant in the U.S. Air Force 's Man in Space Soonest and X @-@ 20 Dyna @-@ Soar human spaceflight programs , Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962 . He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966 , becoming NASA 's first civilian astronaut to fly in space . He performed the first docking of two spacecraft , with pilot David Scott . This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster , in the first in @-@ flight space emergency . 
 Armstrong 's second and last spaceflight was as commander of Apollo 11 , the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969 . Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to the lunar surface and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft , while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command / Service Module . Along with Collins and Aldrin , Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon . President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978 . Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009 . 
 Armstrong died in Cincinnati , Ohio , on August 25 , 2012 , at the age of 82 , after complications from coronary artery bypass surgery . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Neil Armstrong was born on August 5 , 1930 , to Stephen Koenig Armstrong and Viola Louise Engel in Auglaize County , near Wapakoneta , Ohio . He was of Scottish , Irish , and German ancestry , and had two younger siblings , June and Dean . Stephen Armstrong worked as an auditor for the Ohio state government ; the family moved around the state repeatedly after Armstrong 's birth , living in 20 towns . Neil 's love for flying grew during this time , having gotten off to an early start when his father took his two @-@ year @-@ old son to the Cleveland Air Races . When he was five , he experienced his first airplane flight in Warren , Ohio on July 20 , 1936 when he and his father took a ride in a Ford Trimotor , also known as the " Tin Goose " . 
 His father 's last move was in 1944 , back to Neil 's birthplace , Wapakoneta , in Auglaize County . Armstrong attended Blume High School and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield . He earned a student flight certificate on his 16th birthday , then soloed later in August ; all before he had a driver 's license . Armstrong was active in the Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout . As an adult , he was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award . On July 18 , 1969 , while flying towards the Moon inside the Columbia , Armstrong greeted the Scouts : " I 'd like to say hello to all my fellow Scouts and Scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week ; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes " . Houston replied : " Thank you , Apollo 11 . I 'm sure that , if they didn 't hear that , they 'll get the word through the news . Certainly appreciate that . " Among the very few personal items that Neil Armstrong carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge . 
 In 1947 , at age 17 , Armstrong began studying aeronautical engineering at Purdue University . He was the second person in his family to attend college . He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . The only engineer he knew ( who had attended MIT ) dissuaded him from attending , telling Armstrong that it was not necessary to go all the way to Cambridge , Massachusetts , for a good education . 
 His college tuition was paid for under the Holloway Plan . Successful applicants committed to two years of study , followed by two years of flight training and one year of service in the U.S. Navy as an aviator , then completion of the final two years of their bachelor 's degree . Candidates had to promise to not marry until graduation , signed the " Aviation Guarantee " to serve on Active Duty for at least four years , and would not receive a promotion to Ensign until two years after they received their Midshipman 's warrant . 
 = = Navy service = = 
 Armstrong 's call @-@ up from the Navy arrived on January 26 , 1949 , requiring him to report to Naval Air Station Pensacola for flight training at age 18 . This lasted almost 18 months , during which he qualified for carrier landing aboard USS Cabot and USS Wright . On August 16 , 1950 , two weeks after his 20th birthday , Armstrong was informed by letter that he was a fully qualified Naval Aviator . 
 His first assignment was to Fleet Aircraft Service Squadron 7 at NAS San Diego ( now known as NAS North Island ) . Two months later he was assigned to Fighter Squadron 51 ( VF @-@ 51 ) , an all @-@ jet squadron , and made his first flight in a jet , an F9F @-@ 2B Panther , on January 5 , 1951 . In June , he made his first jet carrier landing on USS Essex and was promoted the same week from Midshipman to Ensign . By the end of the month , Essex had set sail with VF @-@ 51 aboard , bound for Korea , where its VF @-@ 51 would act as ground @-@ attack aircraft . 
 Armstrong first saw action in the Korean War on August 29 , 1951 , as an escort for a photo reconnaissance plane over Songjin . Five days later on September 3 , he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon @-@ ni , west of Wonsan . While making a low bombing run at about 350 mph ( 560 km / h ) , Armstrong 's F9F Panther was hit by anti @-@ aircraft fire . While trying to regain control , he collided with a pole at a height of about 20 feet ( 6 m ) , which sliced off about three feet ( 1 m ) of the Panther 's right wing . Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory , but due to the loss of the aileron , ejection was his only safe option . He planned to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters , and therefore flew to an airfield near Pohang , but his ejection seat was blown back over land . A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked Armstrong up ; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of No. <unk> F9F @-@ 2 . 
 Armstrong flew 78 missions over Korea for a total of 121 hours in the air , most of which were in January 1952 . He received the Air Medal for 20 combat missions , a Gold Star for the next 20 , and the Korean Service Medal and Engagement Star . Armstrong left the Navy at age 22 on August 23 , 1952 , and became a lieutenant ( junior grade ) , in the U.S. Naval Reserve . He remained in the reserve for eight years , then resigned his commission on October 21 , 1960 . 
 = = College years = = 
 After his service with the Navy , Armstrong returned to Purdue , where his best grades came in the four semesters following his return from Korea . He had previously earned average marks , but his final GPA was 4 @.@ 8 out of 6 @.@ 0 . He pledged the Phi Delta Theta fraternity after his return and he wrote and co @-@ directed its musical as part of the all @-@ student revue ; he was also a member of Kappa Kappa Psi National Honorary Band Fraternity and a baritone player in the Purdue All @-@ American Marching Band . Armstrong graduated in 1955 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering . 
 After returning to Purdue , he met Janet Elizabeth <unk> , who was majoring in home economics . According to the couple , there was no real courtship , and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement , except that it occurred while Armstrong was working at the NACA 's Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory . They were married on January 28 , 1956 , at the Congregational Church in Wilmette , Illinois . When he moved to Edwards Air Force Base , he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base , while Janet lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles . After one semester , they moved into a house in Antelope Valley . Janet never finished her degree , a fact she regretted later in life . 
 The couple had three children together : Eric , Karen , and Mark . In June 1961 , daughter Karen was diagnosed with a malignant tumor of the middle part of her brain stem ; X @-@ ray treatment slowed its growth , but her health deteriorated to the point where she could no longer walk or talk . Two @-@ year @-@ old Karen died of pneumonia , related to her weakened health , on January 28 , 1962 . 
 Armstrong later completed his Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southern California in 1970 . He would eventually be awarded honorary doctorates by several universities . 
 = = Test pilot = = 
 Following his graduation from Purdue , Armstrong decided to become an experimental research test pilot . He applied at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) High @-@ Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base , which was later redesignated as the ‘ ‘ NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center ’ ’ in 2014 . Although the committee had no open positions , it forwarded his application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland , where Armstrong began working in March 1955 . Armstrong 's stint at Cleveland lasted a couple of months , and by July 1955 he had returned to Edwards AFB for a new job . 
 On his first day at Edwards , Armstrong was tasked his first assignments , which were to pilot chase planes during releases of experimental aircraft from modified bombers . He also flew the modified bombers , and on one of these missions had his first flight incident at Edwards . On March 22 , 1956 , Armstrong was in a Boeing B @-@ 29 Superfortress , which was to air @-@ drop a Douglas D @-@ 558 @-@ 2 Skyrocket . He sat in the right @-@ hand pilot seat while the left @-@ hand seat commander , Stan Butchart , flew the B @-@ 29 . 
 As they ascended to 30 @,@ 000 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 km ) , the number @-@ four engine stopped and the propeller began windmilling ( rotating freely ) in the airstream . Hitting the switch that would stop the propeller 's spinning , Butchart found the propeller slowed but then started spinning again , this time even faster than the other engines ; if it spun too fast , it would break apart . Their aircraft needed to hold an airspeed of 210 mph ( 338 km / h ) to launch its Skyrocket payload , and the B @-@ 29 could not land with the Skyrocket attached to its belly . Armstrong and Butchart brought the aircraft into a nose @-@ down alignment to increase speed , then launched the Skyrocket . At the instant of launch , the number @-@ four engine propeller disintegrated . Pieces of it damaged the number @-@ three engine and hit the number @-@ two engine . Butchart and Armstrong were forced to shut down the number @-@ three engine , due to damage , and the number @-@ one engine , due to the torque it created . They made a slow , circling descent from 30 @,@ 000 ft ( 9 @,@ 000 m ) using only the number @-@ two engine , and landed safely . 
 As a research pilot , Armstrong served as project pilot on the F @-@ 100 Super Sabre A and C variants , F @-@ 101 Voodoo , and the Lockheed F @-@ 104A Starfighter . He also flew the Bell X @-@ 1B , Bell X @-@ 5 , North American X @-@ 15 , F @-@ 105 Thunderchief , F @-@ 106 Delta Dart , B @-@ 47 Stratojet , KC @-@ 135 Stratotanker , and was one of eight elite pilots involved in the paraglider research vehicle program ( <unk> ) . 
 Armstrong 's first flight in a rocket plane was on August 15 , 1957 , in the Bell X @-@ 1B , to an altitude of 11 @.@ 4 miles ( 18 @.@ 3 km ) . The nose landing gear broke on landing , which had happened on about a dozen previous flights of the Bell X @-@ 1B due to the aircraft 's design . He later flew the North American X @-@ 15 seven times ; his penultimate flight reached an altitude of 207 @,@ 500 feet ( 63 @.@ 2 km ) . 
 Armstrong was involved in several incidents that went down in Edwards folklore and / or were chronicled in the memoirs of colleagues . The first occurred during his sixth X @-@ 15 flight on April 20 , 1962 , while Armstrong tested a self @-@ adjusting control system . He flew to a height of over 207 @,@ 000 feet ( 63 km ) , ( the highest he flew before Gemini 8 ) , but the aircraft nose was held up too long during descent and the X @-@ 15 bounced off the atmosphere back up to 140 @,@ 000 feet ( 43 km ) . At that altitude , the air is so thin that aerodynamic surfaces have almost no effect . He flew past the landing field at Mach 3 ( 2 @,@ 000 mph ( 3 @,@ 200 km / h ) ) at over 100 @,@ 000 feet ( 30 km ) in altitude , and ended up 40 miles ( 64 km ) south of Edwards . After sufficient descent , he turned back toward the landing area , and barely managed to land without striking Joshua trees at the south end . It was the longest X @-@ 15 flight in both time and distance from the ground track . 
 Four days later , Armstrong was involved in a second incident , when he flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager . Their job , flying a Lockheed T @-@ 33 Shooting Star , was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake for use as an emergency landing site for the X @-@ 15 . In his autobiography , Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains , but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway . As they attempted a touch @-@ and @-@ go , the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue . Armstrong tells a different version of events , where Yeager never tried to talk him out of it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake . Then Yeager told him to try again , this time a bit slower . On the second landing , they became stuck and according to Armstrong , Yeager was in fits of laughter . 
 Many of the test pilots at Edwards praised Armstrong 's engineering ability . Milt Thompson said he was " the most technically capable of the early X @-@ 15 pilots . " Bill Dana said Armstrong " had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge . " Those who flew for the Air Force tended to have a different opinion , especially people like Yeager and Pete Knight , who did not have engineering degrees . Knight said that pilot @-@ engineers flew in a way that was " more mechanical than it is flying , " and gave this as the reason why some pilot @-@ engineers got into trouble : their flying skills did not come naturally . 
 A few weeks later on May 21 , 1962 , Armstrong was involved in what Edwards ' folklore called the " Nellis Affair . " He was sent in a Lockheed F @-@ 104 Starfighter to inspect <unk> Dry Lake in southern Nevada , again for emergency landings . He misjudged his altitude , and also did not realize that the landing gear had not fully extended . As he touched down , the landing gear began to retract ; Armstrong applied full power to abort the landing , but the ventral fin and landing gear door struck the ground , damaging the radio and releasing hydraulic fluid . Without radio communication , Armstrong flew south to Nellis Air Force Base , past the control tower , and waggled his wings , the signal for a no @-@ radio approach . The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the tail @-@ hook to release , and upon landing , he caught the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain , and dragged the chain along the runway . 
 It took thirty minutes to clear the runway and rig an arresting cable and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him . Milt Thompson was sent in an F @-@ 104B , the only two @-@ seater available , but a plane Thompson had never flown . With great difficulty , Thompson made it to Nellis , but a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout . The runway was again closed to clear it , and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T @-@ 33 Shooting Star , but he almost landed long — and the Nellis base operations office decided that to avoid any further problems , it would be best to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards . 
 Armstrong made seven flights in the X @-@ 15 from November 1960 to July 1962 . He reached a top altitude of 207 @,@ 500 feet ( 63 @.@ 2 km ) in the X @-@ 15 @-@ 3 , and a top speed of Mach 5 @.@ 74 ( 3 @,@ 989 mph ( 6 @,@ 420 km / h ) ) in the X @-@ 15 @-@ 1 ; he left the Dryden Flight Research Center with a total of 2 @,@ 400 flying hours . Over his career , he flew more than 200 different models of aircraft . 
 = = Astronaut career = = 
 In 1958 , Armstrong had been selected for the U.S. Air Force 's Man In Space Soonest program . In November 1960 , he was chosen as part of the pilot consultant group for the X @-@ 20 Dyna @-@ Soar , a military space plane under development by Boeing for the U.S. Air Force , and on March 15 , 1962 , he was selected by the U.S. Air Force as one of seven pilot @-@ engineers who would fly the space plane when it got off the design board . 
 In the months after the announcement that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts , Armstrong became more and more excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment . Armstrong 's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1 , 1962 , deadline . Dick Day , with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards , saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed . At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June , Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless . 
 Deke Slayton called Armstrong on September 13 , 1962 , and asked whether he would be interested in joining the NASA Astronaut Corps as part of what the press dubbed " the New Nine " ; without hesitation , Armstrong said yes . The selections were kept secret until three days later , although newspaper reports had been circulating since earlier that year that he would be selected as the " first civilian astronaut . " Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for the second group ; the other was Elliot See , also a former naval aviator . See was scheduled to command Gemini 9 , but died in a T @-@ 38 crash in 1966 that also took the life of crewmate Charles Bassett . Armstrong was the first American civilian in space , but the first civilian was Valentina Tereshkova of the Soviet Union , nearly three years earlier . A textile worker and amateur parachutist , she was aboard Vostok 6 when it launched on June 16 , 1963 .

 The crew assignments for Gemini 8 were announced on September 20 , 1965 , with Armstrong as Command Pilot and David Scott as Pilot . Scott was the first member of the third group of astronauts to receive a prime crew assignment . The mission launched on March 16 , 1966 ; it was to be the most complex yet , with a rendezvous and docking with the unmanned Agena target vehicle , the second American extra @-@ vehicular activity ( EVA ) by Scott . In total , the mission was planned to last 75 hours and 55 orbits . After the Agena lifted off at 10 a.m. EST , the Titan II carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11 : 41 : 02 am EST , putting them into an orbit from where they would chase the Agena . 
 The rendezvous and first @-@ ever docking between two spacecraft was successfully completed after 6 @.@ 5 hours in orbit . Contact with the crew was intermittent due to the lack of tracking stations covering their entire orbits . Out of contact with the ground , the docked spacecraft began to roll , and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the Orbital Attitude and Maneuvering System ( <unk> ) of the Gemini spacecraft . Following the earlier advice of Mission Control , they undocked , but found that the roll increased dramatically to the point where they were turning about once per second , which meant the problem was in their Gemini 's attitude control . Armstrong decided the only course of action was to engage the Reentry Control System ( RCS ) and turn off the <unk> . Mission rules dictated that once this system was turned on , the spacecraft would have to reenter at the next possible opportunity . It was later thought that damaged wiring made one of the thrusters become stuck in the on position . 
 Throughout the astronaut office there were a few people , most notably Walter Cunningham , who publicly stated that Armstrong and Scott had ignored the malfunction procedures for such an incident , and that Armstrong could have salvaged the mission if he had turned on only one of the two RCS rings , saving the other for mission objectives . These criticisms were unfounded ; no malfunction procedures were written and it was possible to turn on only both RCS rings , not just one or the other . Gene Kranz wrote , " the crew reacted as they were trained , and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong . " The mission planners and controllers had failed to realize that when two spacecraft are docked together , they must be considered to be one spacecraft . 
 Armstrong himself was depressed that the mission had been cut short , canceling most mission objectives and robbing Scott of his EVA . 
 = = = = Gemini 11 = = = = 
 The last assignment for Armstrong in the Gemini program was as the back @-@ up Command Pilot for Gemini 11 , announced two days after the landing of Gemini 8 . Having trained for two flights , Armstrong was quite knowledgeable about the systems and was more in a teaching role for the rookie backup Pilot , William Anders . The launch was on September 12 , 1966 , with Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon on board , who successfully completed the mission objectives , while Armstrong served as CAPCOM . 
 Following the flight , President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Armstrong and his wife to take part in a 24 @-@ day goodwill tour of South America . Also on the tour , which took in 11 countries and 14 major cities , were Dick Gordon , George Low , their wives , and other government officials . In Paraguay , Armstrong impressed dignitaries by greeting them in their local language , Guarani ; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian @-@ born Alberto Santos @-@ Dumont , who was regarded as having beaten the Wright brothers with the first flying machine with his 14 @-@ bis . 
 = = = Apollo program = = = 
 On January 27 , 1967 , the date of the Apollo 1 fire , Armstrong was in Washington , D.C. , with Gordon Cooper , Dick Gordon , Jim Lovell and Scott Carpenter for the signing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty . The astronauts chatted with the assembled dignitaries until 6 : 45 p.m. when Carpenter went to the airport , and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn , where they each found messages to phone the Manned Spacecraft Center . During these telephone calls , they learned of the deaths of Gus Grissom , Ed White and Roger Chaffee . Armstrong and the group spent the rest of the night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened . 
 On April 5 , 1967 , the same day the Apollo 1 investigation released its report on the fire , Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Deke Slayton . The first thing Slayton said was , " The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room . " According to Eugene Cernan , Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement . To Armstrong it came as no surprise — the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini , the only people who could fly the lunar missions . Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9 , which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module @-@ Command / Service Module combination . After design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module ( LM ) , Apollo 9 and Apollo 8 swapped crews . Based on the normal crew rotation scheme , Armstrong would command Apollo 11 . 
 To give the astronauts experience with how the LM would fly on its final landing descent , NASA commissioned Bell Aircraft to build two Lunar Landing Research Vehicles , later augmented with three Lunar Landing Training Vehicles ( LLTV ) . Nicknamed the " Flying <unk> " , they simulated the Moon 's one @-@ sixth of Earth 's gravity by using a turbofan engine to support the remaining five @-@ sixths of the craft 's weight . On May 6 , 1968 , about 100 feet ( 30 m ) above the ground , Armstrong 's controls started to degrade and the LLTV began banking . He ejected safely ( later analysis suggested that if he had ejected half a second later , his parachute would not have opened in time ) . His only injury was from biting his tongue . Even though he was nearly killed , Armstrong maintained that without the <unk> and LLTV , the lunar landings would not have been successful , as they gave commanders valuable experience in the behavior of lunar landing craft . 
 = = = = Apollo 11 = = = = 
 After Armstrong served as backup commander for Apollo 8 , Slayton offered him the post of commander of Apollo 11 on December 23 , 1968 , as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon . In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong 's biography in 2005 , Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Armstrong as commander , lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin and command module pilot Michael Collins , he was offering the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell . After thinking it over for a day , Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin , as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command . Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the Lunar Module Pilot , unofficially the lowest ranked member , and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell , the commander of Gemini 12 , in the number 3 position of the crew . 
 A March 1969 meeting between Slayton , George Low , Bob Gilruth , and Chris Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon , in some part because NASA management saw Armstrong as a person who did not have a large ego . A press conference held on April 14 , 1969 , gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong 's being first ; the hatch opened inwards and to the right , making it difficult for the lunar module pilot , on the right @-@ hand side , to exit first . Slayton added , " Secondly , just on a pure protocol basis , I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out ... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that . Bob Gilruth approved my decision . " At the time of their meeting , the four men did not know about the hatch consideration . The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his 2001 autobiography . 
 On July 16 , 1969 , Armstrong received a crescent Moon carved out of Styrofoam from the pad leader , Guenter Wendt , who described it as a key to the Moon . In return , Armstrong gave Wendt a ticket for a " space taxi " " good between two planets " .

 During the Apollo 11 launch , Armstrong 's heart reached a top rate of 110 beats per minute . He found the first stage to be the loudest — much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch — and the Apollo CSM was relatively roomy compared to the Gemini capsule . This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness , while members of previous crews did . Armstrong was especially happy , as he had been prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics . 
 The objective of Apollo 11 was to land safely rather than to touch down with precision on a particular spot . Three minutes into the lunar descent burn , Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early , which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles . As the Eagle 's landing radar acquired the surface , several computer error alarms appeared . The first was a code 1202 alarm , and even with their extensive training , neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant . They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern ; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer . As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon , the overflow condition was caused by his own counter @-@ checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process , so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data and did not have enough time to execute all tasks , dropping lower @-@ priority ones . Aldrin stated that he did so with the objective of facilitating re @-@ docking with the CM should an abort become necessary , not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition . 
 When Armstrong noticed they were heading towards a landing area which he believed was unsafe , he took over manual control of the LM , and attempted to find an area which seemed safer , taking longer than expected , and longer than most simulations had taken . For this reason , there was concern from mission control that the LM was running low on fuel . Upon landing , Aldrin and Armstrong believed they had about 40 seconds worth of fuel left , including the 20 seconds worth of fuel which had to be saved in the event of an abort . During training , Armstrong had landed the LLTV with less than 15 seconds left on several occasions , and he was also confident the LM could survive a straight @-@ down fall from 50 feet ( 15 m ) if needed . Analysis after the mission showed that at touchdown there were 45 to 50 seconds of propellant burn time left . 
 The landing on the surface of the Moon occurred several seconds after 20 : 17 : 40 UTC on July 20 , 1969 , at which time one of three 67 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) -long probes attached to three of the Lunar Module 's four legs made contact with the surface , a panel light inside the LM lit up , and Aldrin called out , " Contact light . " Armstrong shut the engine off and said , " shutdown . " As the LM settled onto the surface , Aldrin said , " Okay . Engine stop " , then they both called out some post @-@ landing checklist items . After a ten @-@ second pause , Duke acknowledged the landing with , " We copy you down , Eagle . " Armstrong announced the landing to Mission Control and the world with the words , " Houston , Tranquility Base here . The Eagle has landed . " Aldrin and Armstrong celebrated with a brisk handshake and pat on the back before quickly returning to the checklist of tasks needed to ready the lunar module for liftoff from the Moon should an emergency unfold during the first moments on the lunar surface . After Armstrong had confirmed touch @-@ down , Duke re @-@ acknowledged , and expressed the flight controllers ' anxiety : " Roger , ... Tranquility . We copy you on the ground . You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue . We 're breathing again . Thanks a lot . " During the landing , Armstrong 's heart rate , at one point , reached 160 beats per minute , according to the NASA Apollo 11 Mission Report . 
 = = = = = First Moon walk = = = = = 
 Although the official NASA flight plan called for a crew rest period before extra @-@ vehicular activity , Armstrong requested that the EVA be moved to earlier in the evening , Houston time . Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside , Eagle was depressurized , the hatch was opened and Armstrong made his way down the ladder first . 
 At the bottom of the ladder Armstrong said , " I 'm going to step off the LEM now " ( referring to the Apollo Lunar Module ) . He then turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 2 : 56 UTC July 21 , 1969 , then spoke the famous words , " That 's one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind . " 
 Armstrong prepared his famous epigram on his own . In a post @-@ flight press conference , he said that he decided on the words " just prior to leaving the LM [ lunar module ] . " In a 1983 interview in Esquire Magazine , Armstrong explained to George Plimpton : " I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth , but I thought the chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money — fifty – fifty ... Most people don 't realize how difficult the mission was . So it didn 't seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we 'd have to abort landing . " In 2012 , brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil had shown him a note with a draft of the line months before the launch , although historian Andrew Chaikin , who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon , disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission . 
 Recordings of Armstrong 's transmission do not evidence the indefinite article " a " before " man " , though NASA and Armstrong insisted for years that static had obscured it . Armstrong stated he would never make such a mistake , but after repeated listenings to recordings , he eventually admitted he must have dropped the " a " . He later said he " would hope that history would grant me leeway for dropping the syllable and understand that it was certainly intended , even if it was not said — although it might actually have been " . 
 It has since been claimed that acoustic analysis of the recording reveals the presence of the missing " a " ; Peter <unk> Ford , an Australia @-@ based computer programmer , conducted a digital audio analysis and claims that Armstrong did , in fact , say " a man " , but the " a " was inaudible due to the limitations of communications technology of the time . Ford and James R. Hansen , Armstrong 's authorized biographer , presented these findings to Armstrong and NASA representatives , who conducted their own analysis . Armstrong found Ford 's analysis " persuasive . " However , the article by Ford was published on Ford 's own web site rather than in a peer @-@ reviewed scientific journal , and linguists David Beaver and Mark Liberman wrote of their skepticism of Ford 's claims on the blog Language Log . Thus , NASA 's transcript continues to show the " a " in parentheses . 
 When Armstrong made his proclamation , Voice of America was rebroadcast live via the BBC and many other stations worldwide . The estimated global audience at that moment was 450 million listeners , out of a then estimated world population of 3 @.@ 631 billion people . 
 About 20 minutes after the first step , Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface and became the second human to set foot on the Moon , and the duo began their tasks of investigating how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface . Early on , they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight , and also planted the flag of the United States . The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole . Since the rod did not fully extend , and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey , the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance , as if there were a breeze . Shortly after their flag planting , President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office . The President spoke for about a minute , after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds . 
 In the entire Apollo 11 photographic record , there are only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected . The mission was planned to the minute , with the majority of photographic tasks to be performed by Armstrong with a single Hasselblad camera . 
 After helping to set up the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package , Armstrong went for a walk to what is now known as East Crater , 65 yards ( 59 m ) east of the LM , the greatest distance traveled from the LM on the mission . Armstrong 's final task was to remind Aldrin to leave a small package of memorial items to deceased Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Komarov , and Apollo 1 astronauts Gus Grissom , Ed White and Roger B. Chaffee . The time spent on EVA during Apollo 11 was about two and a half hours , the shortest of any of the six Apollo lunar landing missions ; each of the subsequent five landings were allotted gradually longer periods for EVA activities — the crew of Apollo 17 , by comparison , spent over 22 hours exploring the lunar surface . 
 In a 2010 interview , Armstrong explained that NASA limited his Moon walk to two hours because they were unsure how the spacesuits would handle the extreme temperature of the Moon . 
 In 2013 , Popular Science 's photo gallery included a photo that Armstrong took of Aldrin but his own image is visible on Aldrin 's helmet as one of the best astronaut selfies .

 After they re @-@ entered the LM , the hatch was closed and sealed . While preparing for the liftoff from the lunar surface , Armstrong and Aldrin discovered that , in their bulky spacesuits , they had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine ; using part of a pen , they pushed the circuit breaker in to activate the launch sequence . The lunar module then continued to its rendezvous and docked with Columbia , the command and service module . The three astronauts returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean , to be picked up by the USS Hornet . 
 After being released from an 18 @-@ day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon , the crew were feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 45 @-@ day " Giant Leap " tour . Armstrong then took part in Bob Hope 's 1969 USO show , primarily to Vietnam . 
 Later from October 29 – 31 , 1969 he and the rest of the Apollo 11 astronauts visited the city of Tehran , capital of Iran , where he met Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the rest of the nation 's royal family . 
 In May 1970 , Armstrong traveled to the Soviet Union to present a talk at the 13th annual conference of the International Committee on Space Research ; after arriving in Leningrad from Poland , he traveled to Moscow where he met Premier Alexei Kosygin . He was the first westerner to see the supersonic Tupolev Tu @-@ 144 and was given a tour of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center , which Armstrong described as " a bit Victorian in nature " . At the end of the day , he was surprised to view delayed video of the launch of Soyuz 9 — it had not occurred to Armstrong that the mission was taking place , even though Valentina Tereshkova had been his host and her husband , <unk> Nikolayev , was on board . 
 = = Life after Apollo = = 
 = = = Teaching = = = 
 Armstrong announced shortly after the Apollo 11 flight that he did not plan to fly in space again . He was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for aeronautics for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology , Advanced Research Projects Agency ( ARPA ) , but served in this position for only a year , and resigned from it and NASA as a whole in 1971 . 
 He accepted a teaching position in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati , having decided on Cincinnati over other universities , including his alma mater , Purdue , because it had a small aerospace department ; he hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only the USC master 's degree . He began the work while stationed at Edwards years before , and finally completed it after Apollo 11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo , instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight . The official job title he received at Cincinnati was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering . After teaching for eight years , he resigned in 1979 without explaining his reason for leaving . 
 = = = NASA accident investigations = = = 
 Armstrong served on two spaceflight accident investigations . The first was in 1970 , after Apollo 13 , where as part of Edgar <unk> 's panel , he produced a detailed chronology of the flight . Armstrong opposed the report 's recommendation to re @-@ design the service module 's oxygen tanks , the source of the explosion . In 1986 , President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the Rogers Commission which investigated the Space @-@ shuttle Challenger disaster of that year . As vice @-@ chairman , Armstrong was in charge of the operational side of the commission . 
 = = = Business activities = = = 
 After Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971 , he acted as a spokesman for several businesses . The first company to successfully approach him was Chrysler , for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979 . Armstrong thought they had a strong engineering division , plus they were in financial difficulty . He later acted as a spokesman for other companies , including General Time Corporation and the Bankers Association of America . He acted as a spokesman for U.S. businesses only . 
 Along with spokesman duties , he also served on the board of directors of several companies , including Marathon Oil , Learjet , Cinergy ( Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company ) , Taft Broadcasting , United Airlines , Eaton Corporation , AIL Systems and Thiokol . He joined Thiokol 's board after he served on the Rogers Commission ; the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed due to a problem with the Thiokol @-@ manufactured solid rocket boosters . He retired as chairman of the board of <unk> Corporation in 2002 .

 In 1985 , professional expedition leader Mike Dunn organized a trip to take the then " greatest explorers " to the North Pole .

Armstrong said he was curious to see what the North Pole looked like from ground level , as he 'd only seen it from the Moon .

 Unlike former astronauts who actively sought political careers after leaving NASA ( such as U.S. Senators John Glenn ( D @-@ OH , 1974 – 1999 ) and Harrison Schmitt ( R @-@ NM , 1977 – 1983 ) ) , Armstrong was approached by political groups from both parties , but declined all offers . He described his political leanings as favoring states ' rights and opposing the United States acting as the " world 's policeman " . 
 In the late 1950s , Armstrong applied at a local Methodist church to lead a Boy Scout troop . When asked for his religious affiliation , he labeled himself as a deist . His mother later said that Armstrong 's religious views caused her grief and distress in later life as she was more religious . His official biography also describes him as a deist . 
 In 1972 , Armstrong was welcomed into the town of <unk> , Scotland , the traditional seat of Clan Armstrong ; he was made the first freeman of the burgh , and happily declared the town his home . The Justice of the Peace read from an <unk> 400 @-@ year @-@ old law that required him to hang any Armstrong found in the town . 
 In the fall of 1979 , Armstrong was working at his farm near Lebanon , Ohio . As he jumped off of the back of his grain truck , his wedding ring caught in the wheel , tearing off the tip of his ring finger . He collected the severed digit and packed it in ice , and surgeons reattached it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville , Kentucky . In February 1991 , a year after his father had died , and nine months after the death of his mother , he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at Aspen , Colorado . 
 Armstrong married his first wife Janet <unk> on January 28 , 1956 . Their first son Eric was born in 1957 , followed by daughter , Karen , in 1959 . Karen died of a brain tumor in January 1962 , and the couple 's second son Mark was born in 1963 . Armstrong 's first wife , Janet , divorced him in 1994 , after 38 years of marriage . He had met his second wife , Carol Held Knight ( b . 1945 ) , in 1992 at a golf tournament , where they were seated together at the breakfast table . She said little to Armstrong , but two weeks later she received a call from him asking what she was doing — she replied she was cutting down a cherry tree ; 35 minutes later Armstrong was at her house to help out . They were married on June 12 , 1994 , in Ohio , and then had a second ceremony , at San Ysidro Ranch , in California . He lived in Indian Hill , Ohio . 
 Armstrong is generally referred to as a " reluctant " American Hero . John Glenn , the first American to orbit Earth , recalled Armstrong 's legendary humility . " He didn 't feel that he should be out <unk> himself , " the former Ohio senator told CNN . " He was a humble person , and that 's the way he remained after his lunar flight , as well as before . " 
 After 1994 , Armstrong refused all requests for autographs because he found that his signed items were selling for large amounts of money and that many forgeries were in circulation ; any requests that were sent to him received a form letter in reply , saying that he had stopped signing . Although his no @-@ autograph policy was well known , author Andrew Smith observed people at the 2002 Reno Air Races still trying to get signatures , with one person even claiming , " If you shove something close enough in front of his face , he 'll sign . " He also stopped sending out congratulatory letters to new Eagle Scouts , because he believed these letters should come from people who know the Scouts personally . 
 Use of Armstrong 's name , image , and famous quote caused him problems over the years . MTV wanted to use his quote for its now @-@ famous identity depicting the Apollo 11 landing when it launched in 1981 , but he refused . Armstrong sued Hallmark Cards in 1994 after they used his name and a recording of the " one small step " quote in a Christmas ornament without permission . The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money which Armstrong donated to Purdue . 
 In May 2005 , Armstrong became involved in an unusual legal dispute with his barber of 20 years , Mark Sizemore . After cutting Armstrong 's hair , Sizemore sold some of it to a collector for $ 3 @,@ 000 without Armstrong 's knowledge or permission . Armstrong threatened legal action against Sizemore unless he returned the hair or donated the proceeds to a charity of Armstrong 's choosing . Sizemore , unable to retrieve the hair , decided to donate the proceeds to the charity of Armstrong 's choice . 
 Since the early 1980s , Armstrong has been the subject of a hoax saying that he converted to Islam after hearing the adhan , the Muslim call to prayer , while walking on the Moon . The Indonesian singer <unk> wrote a song called " <unk> Suara <unk> di Bulan " ( " The Resonant Sound of the Call to Prayer on the Moon " ) which described Armstrong 's conversion ; the song was discussed widely in various Jakarta news outlets in 1983 . Other similar hoax stories were seen in Egypt and Malaysia . In March 1983 , the U.S. State Department responded by issuing a global message to Muslims saying that Armstrong " has not converted to Islam " . However , the hoax was not completely quieted ; it surfaced occasionally for the next three decades . A part of the confusion stems from the similarity between Armstrong 's American residence in Lebanon , Ohio , and the country Lebanon which has a majority population of Muslims . 
 = = Illness and death = = 
 Armstrong underwent vascular bypass surgery on August 7 , 2012 , to relieve blocked coronary arteries . Although he was reportedly recovering well , he developed complications in the hospital and died on August 25 , in Cincinnati , Ohio . After his death , Armstrong was described , in a statement released by the White House , as " among the greatest of American heroes — not just of his time , but of all time " . The statement further said that Armstrong had carried the aspirations of the United States ' citizens and that he had delivered " a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten . " 
 His family released a statement describing Armstrong as a " reluctant American hero [ who had ] served his nation proudly , as a navy fighter pilot , test pilot , and astronaut ... While we mourn the loss of a very good man , we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true , to be willing to explore and push the limits , and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves . For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil , we have a simple request . Honor his example of service , accomplishment and modesty , and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you , think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink . " This prompted many responses , including the Twitter hashtag " # <unk> " . 
 Armstrong 's colleague on the Apollo 11 mission , Buzz Aldrin , said that he was " deeply saddened by the passing . I know I am joined by millions of others in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew . I had truly hoped that on July 20th , 2019 , Neil , Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing ... Regrettably , this is not to be . " Apollo 11 Command Module pilot Michael Collins said , of Armstrong , " He was the best , and I will miss him terribly . " NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said that : " As long as there are history books , Neil Armstrong will be included in them , remembered for taking humankind 's first small step on a world beyond our own " . 
 A tribute was held in Armstrong 's honor on September 13 at Washington National Cathedral , whose Space Window depicts the Apollo 11 mission and holds a sliver of Moon rock amid its stained @-@ glass panels . In attendance were Armstrong 's Apollo 11 crewmates , Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin ; Eugene A. Cernan , the Apollo 17 mission commander and last man to walk on the Moon ; and former Senator and astronaut John Glenn , the first American to orbit the Earth . In a eulogy , Charles Bolden said , " Neil will always be remembered for taking humankind 's first small step on a world beyond our own , but it was the courage , grace , and humility he displayed throughout this life that lifted him above the stars . " Eugene Cernan recalled Armstrong 's low @-@ fuel approach to the Moon : " When the gauge says empty we all know there 's a gallon or two left in the tank ! " Diana Krall sang the song " Fly Me to the Moon " . Michael Collins led prayers . Aldrin and Collins left immediately after the event . The Apollo 15 commander , David Scott , spoke to the press ; he recalled the Gemini 8 mission with Armstrong when he spoke , possibly for the first time , about an incident in which glue spilled on his harness and prevented it from locking correctly minutes before the hatch had to be sealed or the mission aborted . Armstrong then called on back @-@ up pilot Pete Conrad to solve the problem , which he did , to continue the mission without stopping the countdown clock . " That happened because Neil Armstrong was a team player , he always worked on behalf of the team . " 
 On September 14 , Armstrong 's cremated remains were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean during a burial @-@ at @-@ sea ceremony aboard the USS Philippine Sea . Flags were flown at half @-@ staff on the day of Armstrong 's funeral . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Armstrong received many honors and awards , including the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the Congressional Space Medal of Honor , the Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy , the Sylvanus Thayer Award , the Collier Trophy from the National Aeronautics Association , and the Congressional Gold Medal . The lunar crater Armstrong , 31 mi ( 50 km ) from the Apollo 11 landing site , and asteroid <unk> Armstrong are named in his honor . Armstrong was also inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor , the National Aviation Hall of Fame , and the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame . Armstrong and his Apollo 11 crewmates were the 1999 recipients of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution . 
 Throughout the United States , there are more than a dozen elementary , middle and high schools named in his honor , and many places around the world have streets , buildings , schools , and other places named for Armstrong and / or Apollo . In 1969 , folk songwriter and singer John Stewart recorded " Armstrong " , a tribute to Armstrong and his first steps on the Moon . Purdue University announced in October 2004 that its new engineering building would be named Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering in his honor ; the building cost $ 53 @.@ 2 million and was dedicated on October 27 , 2007 , during a ceremony at which Armstrong was joined by fourteen other Purdue Astronauts . In 1971 , Armstrong was awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy at West Point for his service to the country . The Armstrong Air and Space Museum , in <unk> 's hometown of Wapakoneta , Ohio , and the airport in New Knoxville , where he took his first flying lessons when he was fifteen , were named after him . 
 Armstrong 's authorized biography , First Man : The Life of Neil A. Armstrong , was published in 2005 . For many years , Armstrong turned down biography offers from authors such as Stephen Ambrose and James A. Michener , but agreed to work with James R. Hansen after reading one of Hansen 's other biographies . 
 In a 2010 Space Foundation survey , Armstrong was ranked as the # 1 most popular space hero , and in 2013 , Flying magazine ranked him at # 1 on its list of the " 51 Heroes of Aviation " . 
 The press often asked Armstrong for his views on the future of spaceflight . In 2005 , Armstrong said that a manned mission to Mars will be easier than the lunar challenge of the 1960s : " I suspect that even though the various questions are difficult and many , they are not as difficult and many as those we faced when we started the Apollo [ space program ] in 1961 . " In 2010 , he made a rare public criticism of the decision to cancel the Ares 1 launch vehicle and the Constellation Moon landing program . In an open public letter also signed by Apollo veterans Jim Lovell and Gene Cernan , he noted , " For The United States , the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century , to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future , <unk> our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature " . Armstrong had also publicly recalled his initial concerns about the Apollo 11 mission , when he had believed there was only a 50 percent chance of landing on the Moon . " I was elated , ecstatic and extremely surprised that we were successful " , he later said . 
 On November 18 , 2010 , at age 80 , Armstrong said in a speech during the Science & Technology Summit in The Hague , Netherlands , that he would offer his services as commander on a mission to Mars if he were asked . 
 In September 2012 , the US Navy announced that the first Armstrong @-@ class oceanographic research ship is named RV Neil Armstrong . The ship , christened on March 28 , 2014 , was launched on March 29 , 2014 , passed sea trials August 7 , 2015 and delivered to the Navy on September 23 , 2015 . It is a modern oceanographic research platform capable of supporting a wide range of oceanographic research activities conducted by academic groups . 
 The Space Foundation named Neil Armstrong as a recipient of its 2013 General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award . 
 = Johann Heinrich von Schmitt = 
 Heinrich Schmitt ( 1743 – 11 November 1805 ) was a lieutenant field marshal in the Habsburg military during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars . 
 He developed a sound military reputation as a surveyor , map @-@ maker , and strategist during Austria 's wars with the Ottoman Empire , He served on the Quartermaster 's staff during the War of the First Coalition . As a major general , he was one of Archduke Charles trusted advisers during the War of the Second Coalition campaign in southwestern Germany . 
 In 1799 , his reputation was tarnished by the assassination of the French delegates to the Congress of Rastatt in 1799 , and he retired the following year . When war broke out again in 1805 , he was recalled from retirement and assigned to the combined Russian @-@ Austrian forces on the Danube . On 11 November , Schmitt was killed by friendly fire at the Battle of Dürenstein . 
 = = Family and education = = 
 Heinrich Schmitt was born in 1743 , the son of Johann Sebastian von Schmitt , a captain of cavalry in the Imperial Cuirassier Regiment Graf Cordova . Schmitt may have been born in Pest ( Budapest ) in Hungary , or , as other sources claim , in Bavaria . In 1742 – 43 , his father 's regiment participated in the Battle of Sahay , and then in the Siege of Prague , followed by duty in Bavaria and the Rhineland in 1743 . His father died in 1752 — it is unclear where — and on 25 June 1758 , at the age of 14 years , Schmitt enrolled in the Imperial School of Engineering in <unk> . There he received a thorough technical training in engineering and the extensive education provided for officers on all other major subjects , particularly those pertaining to war and science . 
 After three years , on 15 November 1761 , Schmitt received a commission as ensign , or Fähnrich , in the Infantry Regiment No. 15 Pallavicini . During his assignment with this regiment , he saw service in the last years of the Seven Years ' War ( 1765 – 1763 ) in the Bohemian theater . The lack of accurate maps had hampered the conduct of the Seven Years ' War and , in 1764 , Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the map @-@ making capacity of the military . The idea of the scientific soldier , or a soldier educated in the specifics of military operations , led to an investment in the training and education of officers . The development of map making , and Carlos Pallavicini was at the forefront of this movement . On 1 February 1769 , after proving himself capable in this assignment , he was promoted to first lieutenant and transferred to the reorganized Quartermaster 's staff . 
 = = Military career = = 
 From 1769 to 1778 , Schmitt was assigned to the Turkish border areas , and was especially active in <unk> , in the Banat , bordering the Ottoman Empire . In 1778 , he was promoted to captain and mobilized against Prussia during the short War of the Bavarian Succession , after which he transferred back to the Balkan border areas , where he stayed until 1782 . His thorough knowledge of the country guaranteed him map @-@ making and intelligence assignments in Turkish @-@ occupied Bosnia to gather information in preparation for an upcoming new war against Turkey . In particular , he developed material on the Turk 's military situation . His work on the development of intelligence of Turkish strength in Osijek and Alt <unk> satisfied his superiors and when the war actually broke out in 1787 , he was assigned to the General Staff of the <unk> Corps . He participated in the storming of the fortress at Šabac , in Serbia , on 24 April 1788 . Emperor Joseph II promoted him personally to major on 14 May 1788 . In 1789 , Schmitt fought at the Siege of Belgrade , and on 23 February 1790 , he was promoted to lieutenant colonel . In March 1790 , he transferred to Bohemia , under command of Field Marshal Ernst Gideon von Laudon , for anticipated action against the Kingdom of Prussia . When this war came to naught , he was transferred to the Austrian Netherlands in 1791 , to help contain a local uprising .

 At the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition against France in April 1792 , Schmitt was a staff officer in the main Imperial army in the Austrian Netherlands . He distinguished himself in the defense of the pass of the Croix @-@ aux @-@ Bois ( 14 September 1792 ) and in the battles of Raismes and <unk> on ( both on May 8 , 1793 ) . On 3 September 1793 , after his promotion to colonel , he served under Field Marshal Friedrich Josias Prinz von Sachsen @-@ Coburg @-@ Saalfeld . In the autumn of 1794 , Schmitt organized the retreat of the main Imperial Army , now under the command of Coburg 's successor , Feldzeugmeister Count Clerfayt from their untenable positions in the Austrian Netherlands eastward to the Rhine . 
 In the campaign of 1795 , still serving under Field Marshal Count Clerfayt , he was appointed to the staff of Archduke Charles by Emperor Francis II in April 1796 . Schmitt , now a colonel , was at the Battle of Amberg ( 24 August 1796 ) , fought in the victory at the Battle of Würzburg ( 2 September 1796 ) , and on 6 September 1796 , was promoted to Major General . At this time , he became Archduke Charles ' primary adviser , and served as his Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff . 
 The trust the Archduke placed in Schmitt was briefly interrupted in 1799 when he was connected , by rumor , to the 29 April assassination of the French delegates to the Congress of Rastatt . The assassination occurred as the delegation was leaving the city , and reportedly was committed by soldiers of the 11th Hussars <unk> . The official investigation into the assassination placed enormous pressure on Schmitt , to such an extent that he briefly resigned as Charles ' Chief of Staff , but he was quickly reinstated . On 1 March 1800 , Schmitt was promoted to Lieutenant Field Marshal , but later in that year , the Archduke was himself replaced as commander @-@ in @-@ chief by Field Marshal Pál Kray . Although Schmitt remained on Kray 's staff , he again requested retirement , claiming he was tired and could no longer cope with the stress of the job . In reality , he and Kray 's Quartermaster General , Major General Johann Gabriel <unk> de Courcelles , seldom saw eye @-@ to @-@ eye on any of the main issues facing the army and Kray relied more on <unk> than on Schmitt . His request was initially refused , but on 19 August 1800 , Emperor Francis I approved the petition when Kray seconded it . Schmitt went first to Vienna and then <unk> at <unk> , near Brno . There he lived with his old friend Ferdinand Ritter von <unk> until 1805 .

 During the War of the Third Coalition in 1805 – 1806 , Schmitt returned from retirement to active service . Equipped with a glowing letter of endorsement from Emperor Francis II to the Russian Infantry General Mikhail <unk> Kutuzov ( 1745 – 1813 ) , Schmitt arrived at the Russian headquarters and was appointed Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army . Schmitt met with the Russian forces at the great abbey by Melk , on the Danube , and he and the commanders concocted a plan to encircle Édouard Mortier 's French force near Dürenstein . To do so , they drew not only on their own military experience , but called upon a captain from the region , to use his geographic and local knowledge . 
 = = = Death at Dürenstein = = = 
 Édouard Mortier had marched from Passau and Linz toward Vienna , traveling on the north bank of Danube . His newly created VIII Corps , known as Corps Mortier , consisted of three divisions , which were stretched 56 kilometers ( 35 mi ) apart along the river between Marbach and Dürenstein . This over @-@ extension left his Corps ' northern flank unprotected , against Napoleon 's specific instructions . Schmitt 's plan capitalized on this mistake . On 11 November 1805 , Kutuzov 's column trapped one of Mortier 's divisions , under command of Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière . The Russians used a ruse to entice Gazan into an attack on a small force , and then trapped him between two columns . The French were surrounded at the front and rear by the Russians , caught on the flood plain at Dürenstein . They could neither move forward nor backward . A second French division arrived in mid @-@ afternoon and attacked the Russians in the flank , but were themselves surprised when Schmitt led an additional Russian column out of the mountains . Gazan 's division lost over 40 percent of its men , colors , and several guns . The battle lasted well into the night . In its waning moments , the French were evacuating across the Danube in a flotilla of boats . In the dark confusion , Schmitt was shot , probably by Russian musketry , in a field between the Waldstein and <unk> . Wilhelm von Kotzebue , a German in Russian service , later reported that the column came through the forest road and entered the main road on the river 's edge ; they immediately entered the cross @-@ fire between Dupont 's forward posts of Dragoons and the <unk> 's Russians . He fell by <unk> , and was buried on the battlefield with the dead of his Russian column . Although his burial site has never been found , a monument for him was erected in a park in nearby Krems in 1811 . 
 = = Assessment and legacy = = 
 A key member of the Imperial Staff , Schmitt was the most experienced Austrian leader , called out of retirement for this specific task of organizing the Austro @-@ Russian retreat . He had wide experience as a leader : From the summer of 1796 until his retirement in 1800 , he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army , of the Lower Rhine , the Rhine , and the Army of Germany , and a trusted member of Archduke Charles ' staff . Consequently , he had organized a variety of maneuvers and battle plans under different terrain . The military historian Digby Smith hypothesizes that Schmitt , an experienced officer and sound tactician , would have been more effective at the Battle of Austerlitz , at least more effective than his replacement , Franz von Weyrother , as Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army . After Schmitt 's death , Weyrother , the architect of the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden , developed the general battle plan of the Allied action at Austerlitz . In the long run , it was unlikely that Schmitt 's plan would have changed the overall outcome — Austerlitz was arguably one of Napoleon 's finest battles — but his battle plan would no doubt have been an improvement over the one the Allies used . 
 Schmitt never married . He was known for his bright intellect , his composure , and his innate courage . Heinrich Schmitt was , in his time , recognized as one of the best and most distinguished officers of the Imperial Austrian army . 
 = Maryland Route 22 = 
 Maryland Route 22 ( MD 22 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . The state highway runs 12 @.@ 91 miles ( 20 @.@ 78 km ) from U.S. Route 1 Business ( US 1 Business ) and MD 924 in Bel Air east to an entrance to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen . MD 22 is the main connection between the county seat of Bel Air and Aberdeen , which is the largest city in Harford County . The state highway also provides the primary route between Interstate 95 ( I @-@ 95 ) and Aberdeen Proving Ground . 
 MD 22 was one of the original state roads marked for improvement in 1909 and one of the original state @-@ numbered highways in 1927 . The highway was constructed between Bel Air and Aberdeen in the early 1910s . Another section of highway between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace , the Post Road , was also built in the early 1910s . The Post Road became part of US 40 in 1927 but was designated as an extension of MD 22 after US 40 was relocated in the early 1930s . MD 22 was reconstructed from Bel Air to Aberdeen in the 1950s . MD 22 's present course east of I @-@ 95 was built in the late 1960s ; the old section of MD 22 through Aberdeen became MD 132 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MD 22 begins in the Bel Air Courthouse Historic District in the town of Bel Air as a one @-@ way pair , Fulford Avenue eastbound and Churchville Road westbound , at Main Street . Main Street carries northbound MD 924 and US 1 Business ; the business route enters downtown Bel Air from the west on Fulford Avenue . Churchville Road continues west as unsigned MD <unk> , which intersects Bond Street , which carries southbound MD 924 and US 1 Business ; the business route leaves downtown Bel Air to the west on Churchville Road . The two directions of MD 22 unite at Shamrock Road as Churchville Road , a four @-@ lane divided highway that passes Rockfield Park and The John Carroll School as it leaves the town of Bel Air . The state highway crosses over Bynum Run as it passes through Fountain Green , where the highway intersects MD 543 ( Fountain Green Road ) . 
 East of MD 543 , MD 22 reduces to two lanes and passes the historic Dibb House and Tudor Hall , the latter notable for being the boyhood home of John Wilkes Booth . The state highway passes through the hamlet of <unk> Corner and intersects Thomas Run Road , which leads to Thomas Run Park , Harford Technical High School , Thomas Run Church , Medical Hall Historic District , and the historic Hays @-@ <unk> House on the campus of Harford Community College . In the unincorporated village of Churchville , MD 22 intersects MD 136 ( Calvary Road / <unk> Road ) adjacent to the community 's namesake , Churchville Presbyterian Church . After meeting the west end of MD 155 ( Level Road ) immediately to the east , the state highway curves to the south . After MD 156 ( <unk> Road ) splits to the east , MD 22 returns to an eastward heading to pass through the hamlet of <unk> . The state highway expands to a four @-@ lane highway immediately before intersecting Long Drive , which serves as the entrance to Ripken Stadium , home of the Aberdeen <unk> . Just east of the stadium complex , the state highway meets I @-@ 95 ( John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway ) at a six @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange . 
 MD 22 continues east as Aberdeen Thruway , a four @-@ lane divided highway bypass of downtown Aberdeen that connects I @-@ 95 with Aberdeen Proving Ground . Immediately east of I @-@ 95 , the state highway enters the city limits of Aberdeen and intersects Beards Hill Road . Beards Hill Road heads south as unsigned MD 132A , which leads to MD 132 ( Bel Air Avenue ) , the old alignment of MD 22 that leads to downtown Aberdeen . MD 22 continues east through an intersection with MD 462 ( Paradise Road ) and curves south . The state highway continues through grade @-@ separated crossings of CSX 's Philadelphia Subdivision and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor northeast of downtown Aberdeen . Squeezed in between the two railroad lines is MD 22 's partial cloverleaf interchange with US 40 ( Philadelphia Boulevard ) ; several movements between the two highways are provided via Rogers Avenue , which intersects MD 22 between the bridges across the Philadelphia Subdivision and US 40 . East of the railroads , the highway intersects Post Road , which heads north as another section of MD 132 ( officially MD 132B ) , before reaching its eastern terminus at Bel Air Avenue just west of an entrance to Aberdeen Proving Ground . The highway continues onto the military base as Harford Boulevard . 
 MD 22 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length . The highway is a part of the main National Highway System from I @-@ 95 to Aberdeen Proving Ground and as a principal arterial from MD 924 in Bel Air to I @-@ 95 .

 MD 22 was one of the original state roads marked for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909 . The highway was part of the original main road from Baltimore to Aberdeen and Havre de Grace that passed through Bel Air . The Post Road , also known as the Philadelphia Road , did not become the main connection between Baltimore and Aberdeen until the 1920s . The highway from Bel Air to Churchville , part of the Bel Air Road extending west from Havre de Grace , was already improved beyond a rudimentary dirt road by 1910 . The highway from Churchville to Paradise Road in Aberdeen was constructed in 1911 . The portion of the state road between Bel Air and Churchville was reconstructed in 1913 . The Post Road between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace was constructed as a state aid road around 1911 . All three segments were constructed as a 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) wide macadam road . The original construction did not include the portions of Bel Air Avenue and the Post Road within the limits of Aberdeen . The portion of Bel Air Avenue from Paradise Road to the Post Road and the Post Road from there to approximately the modern intersection of MD 22 and MD 132B were rebuilt as a 17 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) wide concrete road in 1917 . 
 MD 22 was widened to 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) with the addition of 3 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) wide concrete shoulders around 1926 , just before the highway became one of the original state @-@ numbered highways in 1927 . The Post Road became part of US 40 the same year . Both MD 22 and US 40 from Aberdeen to Havre de Grace were widened to 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) by 1930 . US 40 was relocated from the Post Road to its present alignment from Aberdeen to Havre de Grace between 1930 and 1933 . MD 22 was extended north along the Post Road to MD 132B 's present northern terminus by 1939 . Work to further modernize MD 22 began in 1951 when Churchville Road from Bel Air to MD 156 near Churchville was straightened , widened , and resurfaced . The Bel Air – Churchville work was completed in 1953 ; the following year , the MD 22 – MD 155 intersection was reconstructed . MD 22 from MD 156 to US 40 in Aberdeen was widened and resurfaced between 1954 and 1956 . 
 The Aberdeen Thruway was constructed to improve the east – west connection between I @-@ 95 , US 40 , and Aberdeen Proving Ground and to provide grade separated crossings of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad ( now CSX ) , Pennsylvania Railroad ( now Amtrak ) , and US 40 . The grade separations had been contemplated as early as 1942 . Construction on the relocation of MD 22 began in 1967 and was completed in 1969 . The old alignment of MD 22 from I @-@ 95 east and north through Aberdeen to US 40 near Havre de Grace was designated MD 132 . Beards Hill Road was reconstructed as a divided highway between MD 132 and MD 22 and the ramps from northbound I @-@ 95 to MD 132 and from eastbound MD 22 to MD 132 were constructed by 1972 . The western end of MD 22 was changed to a one @-@ way pair when Fulford Avenue was added to the state highway system as eastbound MD 22 in Bel Air in 1979 . The state highway was expanded to a divided highway from the east end of the one @-@ way pair to MD 543 between 1994 and 1999 . MD 22 was expanded to a four @-@ lane divided highway from the I @-@ 95 overpass west to Long Drive in 2004 concurrent with the transformation of the original diamond interchange with I @-@ 95 to a partial cloverleaf with collector @-@ distributor lanes .

 = Mechanical filter = 
 A mechanical filter is a signal processing filter usually used in place of an electronic filter at radio frequencies . Its purpose is the same as that of a normal electronic filter : to pass a range of signal frequencies , but to block others . The filter acts on mechanical vibrations which are the analogue of the electrical signal . At the input and output of the filter , transducers convert the electrical signal into , and then back from , these mechanical vibrations . 
 The components of a mechanical filter are all directly analogous to the various elements found in electrical circuits . The mechanical elements obey mathematical functions which are identical to their corresponding electrical elements . This makes it possible to apply electrical network analysis and filter design methods to mechanical filters . Electrical theory has developed a large library of mathematical forms that produce useful filter frequency responses and the mechanical filter designer is able to make direct use of these . It is only necessary to set the mechanical components to appropriate values to produce a filter with an identical response to the electrical counterpart . 
 Steel and nickel – iron alloys are common materials for mechanical filter components ; nickel is sometimes used for the input and output couplings . Resonators in the filter made from these materials need to be machined to precisely adjust their resonance frequency before final assembly . 
 While the meaning of mechanical filter in this article is one that is used in an electromechanical role , it is possible to use a mechanical design to filter mechanical vibrations or sound waves ( which are also essentially mechanical ) directly . For example , filtering of audio frequency response in the design of loudspeaker cabinets can be achieved with mechanical components . In the electrical application , in addition to mechanical components which correspond to their electrical counterparts , transducers are needed to convert between the mechanical and electrical domains . A representative selection of the wide variety of component forms and topologies for mechanical filters are presented in this article . 
 The theory of mechanical filters was first applied to improving the mechanical parts of phonographs in the 1920s . By the 1950s mechanical filters were being manufactured as self @-@ contained components for applications in radio transmitters and high @-@ end receivers . The high " quality factor " , Q , that mechanical resonators can attain , far higher than that of an all @-@ electrical LC circuit , made possible the construction of mechanical filters with excellent selectivity . Good selectivity , being important in radio receivers , made such filters highly attractive . Contemporary researchers are working on microelectromechanical filters , the mechanical devices corresponding to electronic integrated circuits . 
 = = Elements = = 
 The elements of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors , capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance , elastance ( inverse capacitance ) and resistance , respectively . The mechanical counterparts of these properties are , respectively , mass , stiffness and damping . In most electronic filter designs , only inductor and capacitor elements are used in the body of the filter ( although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output ) . <unk> are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements . Likewise , a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness , but in reality some damping is present as well . 
 The mechanical counterparts of voltage and electric current in this type of analysis are , respectively , force ( F ) and velocity ( v ) and represent the signal waveforms . From this , a mechanical impedance can be defined in terms of the imaginary angular frequency , jω , which entirely follows the electrical analogy . 
 The scheme presented in the table is known as the impedance analogy . Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit , making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint . There is also the mobility analogy , in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage . This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above . Hence , M → C , S → 1 / L , D → G where G is electrical conductance , the inverse of resistance . Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar , but are the dual impedance forms whereby series elements become parallel , capacitors become inductors , and so on . Circuit diagrams using the mobility analogy more closely match the mechanical arrangement of the circuit , making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint . In addition to their application to electromechanical systems , these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics . 
 Any mechanical component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness . This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit , that is , a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor , hence mechanical components are resonators and are often used as such . It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising ( but never quite eliminating ) the unwanted property . <unk> may be made of thin , long rods , that is , the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised . Inductors , on the other hand , may be made of short , wide pieces which maximise the mass in comparison to the compliance of the piece . 
 Mechanical parts act as a transmission line for mechanical vibrations . If the wavelength is short in comparison to the part then a lumped element model as described above is no longer adequate and a distributed element model must be used instead . The mechanical distributed elements are entirely analogous to electrical distributed elements and the mechanical filter designer can use the methods of electrical distributed element filter design .

 = = = Harmonic telegraph = = = 
 Mechanical filter design was developed by applying the discoveries made in electrical filter theory to mechanics . However , a very early example ( 1870s ) of acoustic filtering was the " harmonic telegraph " , which arose precisely because electrical resonance was poorly understood but mechanical resonance ( in particular , acoustic resonance ) was very familiar to engineers . This situation was not to last for long ; electrical resonance had been known to science for some time before this , and it was not long before engineers started to produce all @-@ electric designs for filters . In its time , though , the harmonic telegraph was of some importance . The idea was to combine several telegraph signals on one telegraph line by what would now be called frequency division multiplexing thus saving enormously on line installation costs . The key of each operator activated a vibrating electromechanical reed which converted this vibration into an electrical signal . Filtering at the receiving operator was achieved by a similar reed tuned to precisely the same frequency , which would only vibrate and produce a sound from transmissions by the operator with the identical tuning . 
 Versions of the harmonic telegraph were developed by Elisha Gray , Alexander Graham Bell , Ernest <unk> and others . Its ability to act as a sound transducer to and from the electrical domain was to inspire the invention of the telephone . 
 = = = Mechanical equivalent circuits = = = 
 Once the basics of electrical network analysis began to be established , it was not long before the ideas of complex impedance and filter design theories were carried over into mechanics by analogy . Kennelly , who was also responsible for introducing complex impedance , and Webster were the first to extend the concept of impedance into mechanical systems in 1920 . Mechanical admittance and the associated mobility analogy came much later and are due to Firestone in 1932 . 
 It was not enough to just develop a mechanical analogy . This could be applied to problems that were entirely in the mechanical domain , but for mechanical filters with an electrical application it is necessary to include the transducer in the analogy as well . Poincaré in 1907 was the first to describe a transducer as a pair of linear algebraic equations relating electrical variables ( voltage and current ) to mechanical variables ( force and velocity ) . These equations can be expressed as a matrix relationship in much the same way as the z @-@ parameters of a two @-@ port network in electrical theory , to which this is entirely analogous : 
 <formula> 
 where V and I represent the voltage and current respectively on the electrical side of the transducer . 
 <unk> , in 1921 , was the first to express these equations in terms of mechanical impedance as well as electrical impedance . The element <formula> is the open circuit mechanical impedance , that is , the impedance presented by the mechanical side of the transducer when no current is entering the electrical side . The element <formula> , conversely , is the clamped electrical impedance , that is , the impedance presented to the electrical side when the mechanical side is clamped and prevented from moving ( velocity is zero ) . The remaining two elements , <formula> and <formula> , describe the transducer forward and reverse transfer functions respectively . Once these ideas were in place , engineers were able to extend electrical theory into the mechanical domain and analyse an electromechanical system as a unified whole . 
 = = = Sound reproduction = = = 
 An early application of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction . A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response , resulting in poor sound quality . In 1923 , Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit . The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line , and is a resistive load for the rest of the circuit , while all the mechanical and acoustic parts — from the pickup needle through to the horn — are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy . The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors . This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit . Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband ( in this case 100 Hz to 6 kHz ) and a flat response . Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness , which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture . The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced . Shortly after this , Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers . 
 Harrison used Campbell 's image filter theory , which was the most advanced filter theory available at the time . In this theory , filter design is viewed essentially as an impedance matching problem . More advanced filter theory was brought to bear on this problem by Norton in 1929 at Bell Labs . Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to Darlington the filter he designed as being " maximally flat " . Norton 's mechanical design predates the paper by Butterworth who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic maximally flat filter . The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter , that is , one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance , whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends , making it hard to recognise the design for what it is . Another unusual feature of Norton 's filter design arises from the series capacitor , which represents the stiffness of the diaphragm . This is the only series capacitor in Norton 's representation , and without it , the filter could be analysed as a low @-@ pass prototype . Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit ( Norton 's figure 4 ) . Norton has used here the " turning round the L " impedance transform to achieve this . 
 The definitive description of the subject from this period is Maxfield and Harrison 's 1926 paper . There , they describe not only how mechanical bandpass filters can be applied to sound reproduction systems , but also apply the same principles to recording systems and describe a much improved disc cutting head . 
 = = = Volume production = = = 
 The first volume production of mechanical filters was undertaken by Collins Radio Company starting in the 1950s . These were originally designed for telephone frequency @-@ division multiplex applications where there is commercial advantage in using high quality filters . Precision and steepness of the transition band leads to a reduced width of guard band , which in turn leads to the ability to squeeze more telephone channels into the same cable . This same feature is useful in radio transmitters for much the same reason . Mechanical filters quickly also found popularity in VHF / UHF radio intermediate frequency ( IF ) stages of the high end radio sets ( military , marine , amateur radio and the like ) manufactured by Collins . They were favoured in the radio application because they could achieve much higher Q @-@ factors than the equivalent LC filter . High Q allows filters to be designed which have high selectivity , important for distinguishing adjacent radio channels in receivers . They also had an advantage in stability over both LC filters and monolithic crystal filters . The most popular design for radio applications was torsional resonators because radio IF typically lies in the 100 to 500 kHz band . 
 = = Transducers = = 
 Both magnetostrictive and piezoelectric transducers are used in mechanical filters . Piezoelectric transducers are favoured in recent designs since the piezoelectric material can also be used as one of the resonators of the filter , thus reducing the number of components and thereby saving space . They also avoid the susceptibility to extraneous magnetic fields of the magnetostrictive type of transducer . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 A magnetostrictive material is one which changes shape when a magnetic field is applied . In reverse , it produces a magnetic field when distorted . The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the magnetostrictive material . The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from the motion of the transducer at the filter output . It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range . It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a <unk> current superimposed on the signal , but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design . 
 The usual magnetostrictive materials used for the transducer are either ferrite or compressed powdered iron . Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel @-@ iron wires , but on some designs , especially older ones , nickel wire may be used for the input and output rods . This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive . However , it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak . This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents , a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel . 
 The coil of the transducer adds some inductance on the electrical side of the filter . It is common practice to add a capacitor in parallel with the coil so that an additional resonator is formed which can be incorporated into the filter design . While this will not improve performance to the extent that an additional mechanical resonator would , there is some benefit and the coil has to be there in any case . 
 = = = Piezoelectric = = = 
 A piezoelectric material is one which changes shape when an electric field is applied . In reverse , it produces an electric field when it is distorted . A piezoelectric transducer , in essence , is made simply by plating electrodes on to the piezoelectric material . Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as barium titanate had poor temperature stability . This precluded the transducer from functioning as one of the resonators ; it had to be a separate component . This problem was solved with the introduction of lead <unk> titanate ( abbreviated PZT ) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator . Another common piezoelectric material is quartz , which has also been used in mechanical filters . However , ceramic materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater electromechanical coupling coefficient . 
 One type of piezoelectric transducer is the Langevin type , named after a transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research . This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration . It can also be used on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion . The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator . 
 Another kind of piezoelectric transducer has the piezoelectric material sandwiched in longitudinally , usually into the resonator itself . This kind is good for torsional vibration modes and is called a torsional transducer . 
 = = Resonators = = 
 It is possible to achieve an extremely high Q with mechanical resonators . Mechanical resonators typically have a Q of 10 @,@ 000 or so , and 25 @,@ 000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel @-@ iron alloy . This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits , whose Q is limited by the resistance of the inductor coils . 
 Early designs in the 1940s and 1950s started by using steel as a resonator material . This has given way to nickel @-@ iron alloys , primarily to maximise the Q since this is often the primary appeal of mechanical filters rather than price . Some of the metals that have been used for mechanical filter resonators and their Q are shown in the table . 
 Piezoelectric crystals are also sometimes used in mechanical filter designs . This is especially true for resonators that are also acting as transducers for inputs and outputs . 
 One advantage that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters is that they can be made very stable . The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1 @.@ 5 parts per billion ( ppb ) from the specified value over the operating temperature range ( − 25 to 85 ° C ) , and its average drift with time can be as low as 4 ppb per day . This stability with temperature is another reason for using nickel @-@ iron as the resonator material . Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency ( and other features of the frequency function ) are directly related to variations in the Young 's modulus , which is a measure of stiffness of the material . Materials are therefore sought that have a small temperature coefficient of Young 's modulus . In general , Young 's modulus has a negative temperature coefficient ( materials become less stiff with increasing temperature ) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy can produce a material with a temperature coefficient that changes sign from negative through zero to positive with temperature . Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature . It is possible to adjust the point of zero temperature coefficient to a desired position by heat treatment of the alloy . 
 = = = Resonator modes = = = 
 It is usually possible for a mechanical part to vibrate in a number of different modes , however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode . As well as the straightforward longitudinal mode some others which are used include flexural mode , torsional mode , radial mode and drumhead mode . 
 Modes are numbered according to the number of half @-@ wavelengths in the vibration . Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction ( such as drumhead mode which has two ) and consequently the mode number consists of more than one number . When the vibration is in one of the higher modes , there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion . For some types of resonator , this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support . Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall filter response . In figure 5 , some possible anchor points are shown as wires attached at the nodes . The modes shown are ( 5a ) the second longitudinal mode fixed at one end , ( 5b ) the first torsional mode , ( 5c ) the second torsional mode , ( 5d ) the second flexural mode , ( 5e ) first radial expansion mode and ( 5f ) first radially symmetric drumhead mode . 
 = = Circuit designs = = 
 There are a great many combinations of resonators and transducers that can be used to construct a mechanical filter . A selection of some of these is shown in the diagrams . Figure 6 shows a filter using disc flexural resonators and magnetostrictive transducers . The transducer drives the centre of the first resonator , causing it to vibrate . The edges of the disc move in <unk> to the centre when the driving signal is at , or close to , resonance , and the signal is transmitted through the connecting rods to the next resonator . When the driving signal is not close to resonance , there is little movement at the edges , and the filter rejects ( does not pass ) the signal . Figure 7 shows a similar idea involving longitudinal resonators connected together in a chain by connecting rods . In this diagram , the filter is driven by piezoelectric transducers . It could equally well have used magnetostrictive transducers . Figure 8 shows a filter using torsional resonators . In this diagram , the input has a torsional piezoelectric transducer and the output has a magnetostrictive transducer . This would be quite unusual in a real design , as both input and output usually have the same type of transducer . The magnetostrictive transducer is only shown here to demonstrate how longitudinal vibrations may be converted to torsional vibrations and vice versa . Figure 9 shows a filter using drumhead mode resonators . The edges of the discs are fixed to the casing of the filter ( not shown in the diagram ) so the vibration of the disc is in the same modes as the membrane of a drum . Collins calls this type of filter a disc wire filter . 
 The various types of resonator are all particularly suited to different frequency bands . Overall , mechanical filters with lumped elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700 kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few kilohertz ( kHz ) are rare . The lower part of this range , below 100 kHz , is best covered with bar flexural resonators . The upper part is better done with torsional resonators . Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle , covering the range from around 100 to 300 kHz . 
 The frequency response behaviour of all mechanical filters can be expressed as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above . An example of this is shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a . Elements on the electrical side , such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer , are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design . The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators , and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires . The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted , more or less at will , by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components . In this way , all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design . Any filter realisable in electrical theory can , in principle , also be realised as a mechanical filter . In particular , the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised . As with the electrical counterpart , the more elements that are used , the closer the approximation approaches the ideal , however , for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight . 
 = = = Semi @-@ lumped designs = = = 
 Frequencies of the order of megahertz ( MHz ) are above the usual range for mechanical filters . The components start to become very small , or alternatively the components are large compared to the signal wavelength . The lumped element model described above starts to break down and the components must be considered as distributed elements . The frequency at which the transition from lumped to distributed models takes place is much lower for mechanical filters than it is for their electrical counterparts . This is because mechanical vibrations travel at the speed of sound for the material the component is composed of . For solid components , this is many times ( <unk> for nickel @-@ iron ) the speed of sound in air ( 343 m / s ) but still considerably less than the speed of electromagnetic waves ( approx . <unk> m / s in vacuum ) . Consequently , mechanical wavelengths are much shorter than electrical wavelengths for the same frequency . Advantage can be taken of these effects by deliberately designing components to be distributed elements , and the components and methods used in electrical distributed element filters can be brought to bear . The equivalents of stubs and impedance transformers are both achievable . Designs which use a mixture of lumped and distributed elements are referred to as semi @-@ lumped . 
 An example of such a design is shown in figure 10a . The resonators are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6 , except that these are energised from an edge , leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre , whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance . The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires . The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses . The resonators are treated as lumped elements ; however , the coupling wires are made exactly one half @-@ wavelength ( λ / 2 ) long and are equivalent to a λ / 2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit . For a narrow @-@ band filter , a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b . Consequently , the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have a better response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings . For even higher frequencies , microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below . 
 = = = Bridging wires = = = 
 Bridging wires are rods that couple together resonators that are not adjacent . They can be used to produce poles of attenuation in the stopband . This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection . When the pole is placed near the passband edge , it also has the benefit of increasing roll @-@ off and narrowing the transition band . The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11 . Bridging across a single resonator ( figure 11b ) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband . Bridging across two resonators ( figure 11c ) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband . Using multiple bridges ( figure 11d ) will result in multiple poles of attenuation . In this way , the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range . 
 The method of coupling between non @-@ adjacent resonators is not limited to mechanical filters . It can be applied to other filter formats and the general term for this class is cross @-@ coupled filter . For instance , channels can be cut between cavity resonators , mutual inductance can be used with discrete component filters , and feedback paths can be used with active analogue or digital filters . Nor was the method first discovered in the field of mechanical filters ; the earliest description is in a 1948 patent for filters using microwave cavity resonators . However , mechanical filter designers were the first ( 1960s ) to develop practical filters of this kind and the method became a particular feature of mechanical filters . 
 = = <unk> filters = = 
 A new technology emerging in mechanical filtering is microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) . MEMS are very small <unk> with component sizes measured in micrometres ( μm ) , but not as small as nanomachines . These systems are mostly fabricated from silicon ( Si ) , silicon nitride ( Si3N4 ) , or polymers . A common component used for radio frequency filtering ( and MEMS applications generally ) , is the cantilever resonator . <unk> are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry ; masking , photolithography and etching , with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate . The technology has great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate — much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single silicon chip . 
 The resonator shown in figure 12 is around 120 μm in length . Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30 GHz have been produced using cantilever <unk> as the resonator elements . The size of this filter is around 4 × 3 @.@ 5 mm . <unk> resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200 MHz , but other structures , such as micro @-@ machined cavities , can be used in the microwave bands . Extremely high Q resonators can be made with this technology ; flexural mode resonators with a Q in excess of 80 @,@ 000 at 8 MHz are reported . 
 = = Adjustment = = 
 The precision applications in which mechanical filters are used require that the resonators are accurately adjusted to the specified resonance frequency . This is known as trimming and usually involves a mechanical machining process . In most filter designs , this can be difficult to do once the resonators have been assembled into the complete filter so the resonators are trimmed before assembly . Trimming is done in at least two stages ; coarse and fine , with each stage bringing the resonance frequency closer to the specified value . Most trimming methods involve removing material from the resonator which will increase the resonance frequency . The target frequency for a coarse trimming stage consequently needs to be set below the final frequency since the tolerances of the process could otherwise result in a frequency higher than the following fine trimming stage could adjust for . 
 The <unk> method of trimming is grinding of the main resonating surface of the resonator ; this process has an accuracy of around ± 800 ppm . Better control can be achieved by grinding the edge of the resonator instead of the main surface . This has a less dramatic effect and consequently better accuracy . Processes that can be used for fine trimming , in order of increasing accuracy , are sandblasting , drilling , and laser ablation . Laser trimming is capable of achieving an accuracy of ± 40 ppm . 
 Trimming by hand , rather than machine , was used on some early production components but would now normally only be encountered during product development . Methods available include sanding and filing . It is also possible to add material to the resonator by hand , thus reducing the resonance frequency . One such method is to add solder , but this is not suitable for production use since the solder will tend to reduce the high Q of the resonator . 
 In the case of MEMS filters , it is not possible to trim the resonators outside of the filter because of the integrated nature of the device construction . However , trimming is still a requirement in many MEMS applications . Laser ablation can be used for this but material deposition methods are available as well as material removal . These methods include laser or ion @-@ beam induced deposition . 
 = Tropical Storm Laura ( 1971 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Laura was the final storm in the active 1971 Atlantic hurricane season . It formed on November 12 in the western Caribbean Sea , and reached winds of 70 mph ( 120 km / h ) as it approached western Cuba . Across the island , Laura produced heavy rainfall , peaking at 32 @.@ 5 inches ( 83 cm ) . The resulting flooding killed one person and caused crop damage . 26 @,@ 000 people were forced to evacuate their homes . Initially , Laura was forecast to move across the island and impact the southern United States , but it executed a small loop and turned to the southwest . The storm moved ashore on Belize , one of only four November storms to affect the country . Little impact occurred during Laura 's final landfall , and it dissipated on November 22 over central Guatemala . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Tropical Storm Laura began in a large area of convection across the southwest Caribbean Sea in mid @-@ November . On November 12 , a tropical depression formed about 175 miles ( 280 km ) north of Panama . It moved northwestward , slowly organizing and becoming a tropical storm on November 14 . Receiving the name Laura , the storm continued to intensify as it turned northward toward western Cuba ; late on November 15 , it attained peak winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . Originally , the National Hurricane Center anticipated Laura would attain hurricane status , as well as for it to continue northward into the Gulf of Mexico . Although a cold front was expected to bring the storm to the north , a ridge instead increased over the southeastern United States , which prevented Laura from moving ashore . 
 Tropical Storm Laura maintained peak winds for about 48 hours , during which a minimum pressure of 994 hectopascals ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) was recorded . Steering currents were initially weak , which caused the storm to drift toward the northeast , before the ridge to its north forced the storm to the southwest ; by late on November 17 , Laura finished executing a clockwise loop . Its path to the southwest away from Cuba was unusual ; only two other storms on record – a hurricane in 1888 and Hurricane Ike in 2008 – had a southward element in their path when they affected Cuba , and each struck the northern coast of the country . Laura weakened as it turned westward and later to the south and southwest . After the winds decreased to 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , however , the storm began re @-@ intensifying as it approached Central America . Late on November 20 , Laura again reached peak winds of 70 mph ( 120 km / h ) , which was maintained for 30 hours until the storm made landfall in Punta Gorda , Belize . Early on November 22 , the system dissipated over central Guatemala . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 When Tropical Storm Laura first passed the Cayman Islands , it produced up to 3 inches ( 7 @.@ 5 cm ) of rainfall . As it was slowly moving off of the coast of Cuba , Laura dropped heavy rainfall , including nearly 20 inches ( 50 cm ) across most of the Isle of Youth ; one station on the island reported 14 inches ( 36 cm ) in 24 hours . The highest total in the country was 32 @.@ 5 inches ( 83 cm ) , and overall the storm impacted four provinces , including Isle of Youth , Pinar del Río , La Habana , and the city of Havana . On the Isle of Youth , Laura produced winds of 70 mph ( 120 km / h ) , with gusts to 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . On the mainland , the storm destroyed 20 homes and several tobacco sheds , with damage also reported to the coffee , sugar , fruit , and vegetable crops . Due to the flooding , officials forced 26 @,@ 000 people from their homes in Pinar del Río , and one person in that province drowned while crossing a river . The storm 's passage was believed to have diverted a flock of great black @-@ backed gulls toward Central America and north @-@ coastal South America ; the species is usually found in the Mid @-@ Atlantic states , and were migrating to the Gulf Coast or Cuba when they were affected by the storm . 
 When Laura 's path was uncertain , forecasters advised fishermen to remain at port along the Yucatan Peninsula and southern Florida . Gale warnings were also issued for the Florida Keys , due to the uncertainty . No significant damage or casualties were reported in Central America , although heavy rainfall was reported across the region . On Glover 's Reef off the coast of British Honduras ( now Belize ) , the storm stranded a group of about 20 scientists affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution ; the group was affected by the strong winds and rains , and required rescue . The storm damaged several buildings along the mainland . 
 Laura was one of only four storms to form in November and affect Belize , the others being a tropical storm in 1898 , a hurricane in 1942 , and Hurricane Ida in 2009 . 
 = Brad Mehldau = 
 Bradford Alexander " Brad " Mehldau ( / <unk> / ; born August 23 , 1970 ) is an American jazz pianist , composer , and arranger . 
 Mehldau studied music at The New School , and toured and recorded while still a student . He was a member of saxophonist Joshua Redman 's Quartet with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade in the mid @-@ 1990s , and has led his own trio since at least 1992 . His first long @-@ term trio featured bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Jorge Rossy ; in 2005 Jeff Ballard replaced Rossy . These bands have released a dozen albums under the pianist 's name . 
 Since the early 2000s Mehldau has experimented with other musical formats in addition to trio and solo piano . Largo , released in 2002 , contains electronics and input from rock and classical musicians ; later examples include touring and recording with guitarist Pat Metheny , writing and playing song cycles for classical singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter , composing orchestral pieces for 2009 's Highway Rider , and playing electronic keyboard instruments in a duo with drummer Mark Guiliana . 
 Aspects of pop , rock , and classical music , including German Romanticism , have been absorbed into Mehldau 's writing and playing . Through his use of some traditional elements of jazz without being restricted by them , simultaneous playing of different melodies in separate hands , and incorporation of pop and rock pieces , Mehldau has influenced musicians in and beyond jazz in their approaches to writing , playing , and choice of repertoire . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Mehldau was born on August 23 , 1970 , in Jacksonville , Florida . His father , Craig Mehldau , was a doctor ; and his mother , Annette , was a homemaker . His sister , Leigh Anne , became a social worker . There was always a piano in the house during Mehldau 's childhood , and he initially listened to pop and rock music on the radio . His family moved to West Hartford , Connecticut , when Mehldau was 10 . Up to this point he had played mostly simple pop tunes and exercises from books , but the move brought him a new piano teacher , who introduced him to classical music . This new interest lasted for a few years , but by the age of 14 he was listening more to jazz , including recordings by saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist Oscar Peterson . 
 Mehldau attended William H. Hall High School and played in its concert jazz band . From the age of 15 until he graduated from high school he had a weekly gig at a local club , and performed for weddings and other parties . In his junior year at the school he won Berklee College 's Best All Round Musician Award for school students . Mehldau described himself as being , up to this point , " a white , upper @-@ middle @-@ class kid who lived in a pretty homogenized environment " . 
 After graduating , Mehldau moved to New York City in 1988 to study jazz and contemporary music at The New School . He studied under pianists Fred Hersch , Junior Mance and Kenny Werner , and drummer Jimmy Cobb . In 1989 Mehldau was part of saxophonist Christopher <unk> 's band that toured for several months ; as a result of playing so often with one group , Mehldau was able to assimilate the music of Wynton Kelly and McCoy Tyner , his two principal influences on piano up to that point , and began to develop his own sound . Before the age of 20 Mehldau also had gigs in Cobb 's band , along with fellow student Peter Bernstein on guitar . 
 = = Later life and career = = 
 = = = 1991 – 1998 = = = 
 Mehldau 's first recording was for <unk> 's The Natural Moment in 1991 ; his first tour of Europe was also with the saxophonist that year . Mehldau 's interest in classical music returned when he was in his early twenties , and spurred him into developing his left @-@ hand playing . He led his own trio from at least 1992 , when he played at New York 's Village Gate . Mehldau also played as sideman with a variety of musicians around this time . His performances with saxophonist <unk> <unk> included a tour of Europe early in 1993 , and Mehldau 's first released recordings as co @-@ leader , from a May concert in Barcelona . Mehldau also toured for 18 months with saxophonist Joshua Redman . This association began in 1993 , but they had played together for a short period the previous year . Redman and his band attracted attention , with their 1994 album <unk> also aiding Mehldau 's profile . They also played together for the soundtrack to the 1994 film Vanya on 42nd Street , for which Redman wrote the music . 
 Mehldau graduated from The New School in 1993 . He formed his first long @-@ term trio in 1994 , with bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Jorge Rossy . In the following year , Mehldau recorded Introducing Brad Mehldau for Warner Bros. , his first album as sole leader . It was well received , with The Penguin Guide to Jazz commenting that " it 's as if he were aware of jazz tradition but entirely unencumbered by it . " His second album for Warner Bros. , The Art of the Trio Volume One , was recorded in 1995 and was widely praised by critics . The title was selected by producer Matt Pierson as one that would attract attention and help to build a brand . 
 By the mid- to late 1990s Mehldau was regarded by some as one of the leading jazz musicians : critic John Fordham described him as " the next great keyboard star of jazz " . The appreciation was not universal : some of the pianist 's self @-@ penned liner notes and interview comments , which included philosophical musings and complaints about comparisons with pianist Bill Evans , engendered dislike in some , thereby , in critic Nate Chinen 's words , " leaving Mehldau with a lingering reputation for pretentiousness and self @-@ indulgence . " Many critics did , though , reassess their judgment of his main influences , which previously had often been given as Evans , an assessment that was perhaps attributable more to race than to music . Another , non @-@ musical , similarity with Evans that was commented on was Mehldau 's struggle with an addiction to heroin during the 1990s , up to 1998 . Around 1996 he moved to Los Angeles , to try to overcome this drug problem . Mehldau later stated that " Once I stopped using heroin , it was like a rush of creativity that had been held in check came out " . 
 In 1996 Mehldau made the first of several recordings with saxophonist Lee Konitz and bassist Charlie Haden . Mehldau 's contributions to film music continued in 1997 , with an accompanist role for some of the tracks recorded for Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil . His series of trio albums also continued , employing some of the traditional elements of jazz while not conforming to or being restricted by its norms . Live at the Village Vanguard : The Art of the Trio Volume Two consisted entirely of standards , and was recorded at a series of 1997 concerts at the Village Vanguard , and released the following year . The title again attracted attention , as concert recordings from the same club had been issued by some of the biggest names in jazz , including Evans , and saxophonists Coltrane and Sonny Rollins . The studio album Songs : The Art of the Trio Volume Three followed later in 1998 , and contained Mehldau originals , standards , plus Nick Drake 's " River Man " , and Radiohead 's " Exit Music ( For a Film ) " . This album was chosen by Fordham as his jazz CD of the year . " [ Although it ] might seem to some a little introverted , and certainly distinctly classical in flavor " , he wrote , " the intricacy and counter @-@ melodic richness of a great pianist is astonishingly balanced against the more direct and open eloquence a great vocalist might bring . " 
 Mehldau became established on the international jazz festival scene in the mid- to late 1990s , having played at events such as the Montreal International Jazz Festival and the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1997 , and the North Sea Jazz Festival in 1998 . Also in 1998 , the pianist reunited with Redman for the saxophonist 's Timeless Tales ( For Changing Times ) , and played on country artist Willie Nelson 's Teatro . That summer , Mehldau spent a few months in Germany , developing his interest in its language , literature , and music . 
 = = = 1999 – 2004 = = = 
 Mehldau 's interest in figures of 19th century German Romanticism , including Brahms , Schubert , and Schumann , influenced his first solo piano release , Elegiac Cycle , which was recorded in 1999 and broke the sequence of trio recordings under his name . Art of the Trio 4 : Back at the Vanguard was recorded and released in the same year , presenting more performances from the Village Vanguard . The recording features standards , Mehldau originals , Miles Davis ' " Solar " , and another version of " Exit Music ( For a Film ) " . Also in 1999 , Mehldau was pianist for two albums by saxophonist Charles Lloyd . In the following year , Places , an album containing both Mehldau solo piano pieces and trio performances , was released . All of the tracks were Mehldau originals , and were based on his experiences of visiting and revisiting various locations worldwide . Progression : The Art of the Trio , Vol . 5 , the final album in that series , was another concert recording from the Village Vanguard , and was recorded in 2000 and released in 2001 . Looking back on his earlier career , Mehldau commented in 2005 that " The trio created my identity " . In the three or four years up to the end of 2001 , his trio had toured for the majority of each year . 
 In 2001 Mehldau expanded from playing on film soundtracks , which had included The Million Dollar Hotel and Space Cowboys , to scoring , with the French film Ma femme est une <unk> . In the same year , he left Los Angeles . He first played with saxophonist Wayne Shorter that year , and recorded the Grammy Award @-@ winning Alegría with him a couple of years later . 
 While trio performances and recordings continued , Mehldau began in the early to mid @-@ 2000s to broaden the musical settings in which he appeared as leader . An early instance was his 2002 album Largo , which was Mehldau 's first departure from piano solo or trio albums . It was produced by Jon Brion , whom Mehldau had met at a California club that hosted weekly happenings . On the album , in addition to Mehldau 's usual trio , rock musicians and instruments associated more with classical music were employed , as were experiments with prepared piano and " multiple layers of electronically enhanced sound " . As of 2010 , this was reported to be Mehldau 's best @-@ selling album . 
 The results of two further days of recording in 2002 were split over two trio albums : Anything Goes , released in 2004 , contained performances of compositions by others ; the Mehldau originals were released two years later on House on Hill . A solo piano recording from a 2003 concert , Live in Tokyo , showed greater lyricism appearing in Mehldau 's playing , and was released in 2004 as his first album for Nonesuch Records , an imprint of Warner Bros. In the summer of 2004 he toured Europe for three weeks with a band that included guitarist Kurt <unk> and Redman . That autumn , Mehldau formed a quartet , with Mark Turner on saxophones , Grenadier on bass , and Jeff Ballard on drums . 
 = = = 2005 – present = = = 
 In 2005 Ballard replaced Rossy as the drummer in Mehldau 's trio . This , in the view of critic Ray Comiskey , did not radically change the trio 's sound , but it did give them " a harder edge and pushed Mehldau more , with bassist Larry Grenadier left more in a fulcrum role , the centre around which piano and drums cavort . " Another critic , Ben Ratliff , suggested that the new trio 's sound was " denser and more tumultuous " , with rhythms more overt than with the previous trio . In February 2005 Mehldau performed in Hong Kong for the first time , with his new trio . Their first album , Day Is Done , was recorded the following month . 
 Mehldau continued to expand beyond trio and solo playing . In the spring of 2005 he premiered a song cycle that he had written for classical music singer Renée Fleming . This association was based on a commission from Carnegie Hall ; their 2006 recording contained music set to poems by Rainer Maria Rilke and Louise Bogan . Mehldau also collaborated with guitarist Pat Metheny from 2005 – they recorded two albums together that year , along with Grenadier and Ballard , and in 2007 went on a worldwide tour . 
 Another Village Vanguard recording , Brad Mehldau Trio Live , was recorded in 2006 and released two years later . This also contained a variety of sources of material , including " Wonderwall " by rock band Oasis , " Black Hole Sun " by grunge band Soundgarden , and Chico Buarque 's samba " O Que Será " ; " it 's business as usual – state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art contemporary jazz piano " , commented Fordham . A further recording from 2006 was released as Live in <unk> in 2011 ; this contained two CDs and one DVD of a solo concert by the pianist . Mehldau asserted that his third solo recording " is the beginning of a freer approach , [ ... ] and maybe [ contains ] more ease and fluidity in a musical texture with several simultaneous voices " . In 2006 Mehldau also played on saxophonist Michael Brecker 's final album , Pilgrimage . 
 In March 2007 Mehldau first performed his piano concerto " The Brady Bunch Variations for Piano and Orchestra " , with the Orchestre national d 'Île @-@ de @-@ France at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris . Later that decade , Carnegie Hall awarded Mehldau another commission – to write the song cycle Love Songs for singer Anne Sofie von Otter ; they premiered it together in 2009 and recorded the songs the following year . In 2009 Mehldau began a two @-@ year period as curator of London 's Wigmore Hall jazz series , which included a performance with von Otter in the second year . 
 In 2009 Mehldau also recorded Highway Rider , an album that combined his usual trio with guest musicians and a 28 @-@ piece orchestra . Again based compositionally on the theme of travel or a journey , the album was produced by Brion , and , in critic Mike Hobart 's description , " probes the confluence of the arbitrary and non @-@ arbitrary in music , of balancing what is committed to the page with improvisation . " This was pursued further in the winter of 2010 – 11 , in public performances of pieces from the album in the US and Europe . Mehldau 's trio returned to the studio for the first time in several years in 2008 and again in 2011 , resulting in Ode , an album of the pianist 's originals , and Where Do You Start , an album of covers . Down Beat reviewer Jim <unk> commented that , on the former album , " More than ever , Mehldau uses his instrument as a drum , popping staccato notes into the maw of the rhythm section 's formidable bustle .

 During 2010 – 11 Mehldau held Carnegie Hall 's Richard and Barbara Debs Composer 's Chair , the first jazz musician to do so . In 2011 he toured with von Otter again , and played and recorded piano duets with Kevin Hays , and piano – mandolin duets with Chris Thile . The Hays collaboration was on arrangements by Patrick <unk> , with whom Mehldau had attended high school . One piece from their album , Modern Music , featured the pianists playing a composed left @-@ hand part while improvising with the other hand ; " to do both at once is a real test . The brain feels like it 's split in half " , commented Mehldau . In 2012 Mehldau and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra performed his " Variations for Piano and Orchestra on a Melancholy Theme " in Europe . The piece was originally for solo piano , but was converted by Mehldau for a commission by the Orchestra ; it was performed in the US the following year . 
 In 2013 Mehldau began touring with drummer Mark Guiliana as a synthesizer @-@ oriented duo that was given the portmanteau name " Mehliana " . Their playing was largely improvised , and distantly influenced by dub , drum ' n ' bass , electro , and funk . They released an album , Mehliana : Taming the Dragon , in February 2014 . Late in 2015 , a collection of solo piano recordings from Mehldau 's concerts in Europe in the 2004 – 14 period was released , entitled 10 Years Solo Live . Another trio recording with Grenadier and Ballard , Blues and Ballads , was recorded in 2012 and 2014 and was released in 2016 . Also in 2016 , Mehldau and Guiliana formed a trio with guitarist John Scofield ; they played in the United States before touring Europe .

 Mehldau has expressed an interest in , and knowledge of , philosophy and literature . In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia , linking pleasure and pain to musical expression : 
 I love the part of the Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn 't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx . When he can 't help himself , he looks back , and she is pulled back downstream away from him , taken away forever . Music is that moment right when he looks at her : seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever . There 's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn 't . Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time . 
 In Stuart Nicholson 's words , " Mehldau 's art is not based on negotiating his way through a harmonic sequence with a string of bravura licks [ ... ] Instead he patiently weaves melodic developments from motifs , fragments and inversions of the [ ... ] songs he plays into the fabric of his <unk> , making the tunes gradually assume the proportions of an alternative composition . " Fordham stated that " Mehldau demonstrates immense attention to detail , control of dynamics , and patience in developing an improvisation 's shape over a longer span than the chorus @-@ structure of a popular song . " 
 Mehldau often plays a separate melody with each hand , and one of the central features of his music is the playing of improvised counterpoint . He stated in 2002 that some of the content of his playing is affected by the music that he has recently been listening to : " If I 'm digging a Brahms intermezzo that 'll find its way in . If it 's McCoy Tyner , there 'll be more of that . " Mehldau 's performances often employ unusual rhythmic meters ; for example , he plays his arrangement of " All the Things You Are " on Art of the Trio 4 in 7 / 4 time , and " I Didn 't Know What Time It Was " on Art of the Trio 1 in 5 / 4 . He developed this ability over a period of around a year , with the help of Rossy . Mehldau is able to reach tenth and eleventh intervals on the piano . 
 Mehldau cites pianists Larry Goldings ( for " his full approach to the instrument " ) and Hays ( for adding alternative harmonies to the set one ) , as well as guitarist Bernstein ( for showing the value of playing melodic phrases instead of just rehearsed patterns ) as direct influences on his own playing , in addition to Jesse Davis , Kurt <unk> , David Sánchez , Mark Turner , and the other members of his own trio . He has stated that Hersch was his biggest influence as a player of solo piano . 
 = = Compositions = = 
 Fordham described Mehldau 's compositions as " miniature tapestries of taut lyricism and surprising turns " . Mehldau himself indicated that some of his compositions address a specific need , such as integrating a particular rhythm into his trio , while others emerge from something he has played while improvising . In the latter case , Mehldau likened the difficulty of the composition process to that of a game of chess : " The opening is always easy for me , the middle gets more difficult , more of an intellectual process , more trial and error at work , and the end is always difficult for me . " These struggles to find satisfactory endings stem from the tension between needing to close a piece and his desire to leave a sense of open @-@ endedness – " an escape duct of possibility " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Mehldau is married to Dutch jazz vocalist <unk> , with whom he has recorded and toured . They met in 1997 , and have three children . The eldest is a daughter who was born in 2001 . Mehldau stated early in 2006 that family responsibilities meant that he was making shorter tours . As of 2010 , he divided his non @-@ touring time between living in Amsterdam and New York . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Mehldau 's trio was , in Hobart 's words , " the first successfully to add post @-@ Beatles pop into the jazz repertoire without trivialising either " , and shifted the " traditional emphasis on bravura technique and group dynamics [ ... ] to a focus on subtleties of touch and where @-@ my @-@ fancy @-@ takes @-@ me musings . " Such differences in repertoire and approach became common in small @-@ group jazz . His combining of right- and left @-@ hand playing , moving away from the more typical right @-@ hand dominated playing , also influenced pianists . 
 In 2013 Chinen stated that " Mehldau is the most influential jazz pianist of the last 20 years " . Pianist Ethan Iverson , a contemporary of Mehldau 's , stated that Mehldau was the principal influence on his peers , beginning in the late 1990s . Pianist Gerald Clayton ( born 1984 ) summarized Mehldau 's importance in a 2013 interview : " He brought in a new feel and sound in jazz . I don 't know a single modern pianist who hasn 't taken something from Brad . I told him that I should be arrested for all the stuff I 've stolen from him . " Redman said in 2010 that Largo had been particularly important to musicians : " Brad has had a lot of influential records , [ ... but ] if you talk to musicians , especially younger musicians , so many of them will name that as a defining record . " Marco Benevento and Aaron Parks are among the improvisers who have been affected by the 2002 album . 
 = = Honors = = 
 Mehldau won Down Beat 's Readers Poll piano award in 1999 , 2000 , 2002 , 2004 , 2007 , 2011 , and 2012 . He was the 2006 winner of the Miles Davis Prize , awarded by the Montreal International Jazz Festival for " jazz artists who have made significant artistic and innovative contributions to the genre " . In 2015 Mehldau received the Wigmore Medal , which " recognises significant figures in the international music world who have a strong association with the [ Wigmore ] Hall . " 
 As of December 2014 Mehldau had been nominated for five Grammy Awards . He was nominated for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo on " Blame It on My Youth " from The Art of the Trio Volume One in 1998 , Best Jazz Instrumental Performance , Individual or Group for Art of the Trio 4 : Back at the Vanguard in 2000 , Best Jazz Instrumental Album , Individual or Group for Brad Mehldau Trio Live in 2009 , Best Improvised Jazz Solo for the title track of Ode in 2013 , and Best Improvised Jazz Solo for " Sleeping Giant " from Mehliana : Taming the Dragon in 2015 .

 = Yoani Sánchez = 
 Yoani María Sánchez Cordero ( born September 4 , 1975 ) is a Cuban blogger who has achieved international fame and multiple international awards for her critical portrayal of life in Cuba under its current government . 
 Sanchez attended primary school during the affluent time when the Soviet Union was providing considerable aid to Cuba . However , her high school and university education coincided with the loss of financial aid to Cuba following the Soviet Union 's collapse , creating a highly public educational system and style of living that subsequently left Sanchez with a strong need for personal privacy . Sanchez 's university education left her with two understandings ; first , that she had acquired a disgust for “ high culture ” , and second that she no longer had an interest in philology , her chosen field of university study . 
 Sánchez , disillusioned with her home country , left Cuba for Switzerland in 2002 , and it was during this time that she became interested in computer science . When she finally returned to Cuba , Sanchez helped to establish Contodos , a magazine that continues to act as a forum for Cuban free expression , and a vehicle for reporting news . Sánchez is best known for her blog , Generación Y ( Generation Y ) ; which , despite censorship in Cuba , she is able to publish by e @-@ mailing the blog entries to friends outside the country who then post them online . The blog is translated and available in 17 languages . 
 Time magazine listed her as one of the world 's 100 most influential people in 2008 , stating that " under the nose of a regime that has never tolerated dissent , Sánchez has practiced what paper @-@ bound journalists in her country cannot ; freedom of speech " . In November 2009 , U.S. President Barack Obama , wrote that her blog " provides the world a unique window into the realities of daily life in Cuba " and applauded her efforts to " empower fellow Cubans to express themselves through the use of technology . " 
 = = Biography = = 
 Yoani Sánchez was born September 4 , 1975 , in central Havana , Cuba , one of two daughters , to William Sánchez and Maria <unk> Cordero . Her father worked , as his father had before him , on the state railroad system , first as a laborer and later as an engineer . As the nation ’ s railroad system fell apart after the collapse of communism in Europe , William Sánchez , out of work along with many of his colleagues , became a bicycle repairman . 
 Sánchez grew up and attended school in central Havana during the years when the Soviet Union was supporting the island and its communist revolution with tangible aid , nearly $ 9 billion in the final year . Sánchez 's secondary and university years coincided with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the loss of its subsidies to Cuba that had for nearly three decades provided about 80 percent of Cuba ’ s international trade . During her high school years , she attended a " school in the countryside " about which she wrote : 
 I left high school in the countryside feeling that nothing belonged to me , not even my body . Living in shelters creates the sensation that your whole life , your privacy , your personal possessions and even your nakedness has become public property . " Sharing " is the obligatory word and it comes to seem normal not to be able — ever — to be alone . After years of mobilizations , agricultural camps , and a sad school in Alquízar , I needed an overdose of privacy . 
 Sánchez studied for two years in the Instituto <unk> with a major in Spanish literature . She transferred to the Faculty of Arts and Letters in 1995 , and gave birth to her son in August of that year . Sanchez graduated within five years with a degree in Hispanic philology and a specialty in contemporary Latin American literature . Her thesis was titled Words Under Pressure . A Study of the Literature of Dictatorship in Latin America . Sanchez says that by the end of her university studies she " understood two things : the first , that the world of intellectualism and high culture disgusted me and the saddest , that I no longer wanted to be a philologist . " By September 2000 , she had found a job with Editorial Gente Nueva , a publisher of children 's literature . After a short period of employment with Gente Nueva , Sanchez asked to be released from her position , then focused on a higher paying job as a freelance Spanish instructor for German tourists visiting Havana . According to Sánchez , this was during a time " when engineers preferred to drive taxis , teachers worked as hotel desk clerks , and store counters were tended by neurosurgeons or nuclear physicists . " 
 In 2002 , claiming disillusionment with her home country , Sánchez decided to leave Cuba and emigrated to Switzerland . She was eventually joined by her son and husband . Two years later she decided to return to Cuba citing “ family reasons " However , since she had been out of the country for more than eleven months without special permission , Sánchez had lost the right to return . Sánchez states that she then flew home to Cuba " for a two @-@ week family visit " on a round @-@ trip ticket , and by destroying her passport was able to avoid being forced on a plane back to Switzerland . The Cuban government says that she was granted a waiver allowing her to recover her permanent resident status in Cuba . She finally resettled in Havana . During this time , Sánchez discovered her current profession , computer science . In 2004 , she founded , together with a group of Cubans – all based on the island – a magazine , <unk> , based on reflection and debate . She also helped establish the web portal Desde Cuba ( From Cuba ) , an on @-@ line magazine and collection of individual blogs , of which Sánchez 's was the first . Sánchez began to sign her posts in 2008 , abandoning anonymous blogging . That year , she requested permission to travel to Spain to receive the Ortega y Gasset Journalism Award but permission was denied . Her request for permission to travel to an international documentary film festival in Prague , of which she was a member of the jury , was also denied . 
 In October 2009 , Sánchez was awarded Columbia University 's " Maria Moors Cabot prize " and was invited to New York to accept the award . The Cuban government denied her permission to attend . Nicholas Lemann , dean of Columbia 's Graduate School of Journalism , criticized the decision , stating that " The Cuban government ought to value Ms. Sanchez 's work as a sign that young Cubans are ready to take Cuba into a better future – one that will have the free press the Cuban people deserve . " 
 = = = A journey to South America and Europe = = = 
 Sánchez flew to Prague in the Czech Republic , where she was received by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and former presidential candidate Karel Schwarzenberg who was particularly interested in discussing the reforms that took place in Cuba during 2012 and the state of civil society there . Schwarzenberg remarked that he was not as enthusiastic regarding the reforms as representatives of some other countries , as he could still remember reforms from the communist era in former Czechoslovakia that " ... changed nothing , but to the West looked amazing . " 
 Sánchez was also a guest of human rights festival One world , organized by a non @-@ profit humanitarian organization People In Need . A film by a Swiss director Barbara Miller Forbidden Voices : How to Start a Revolution with a Laptop was among the films shown during the festival . The film presents three women - one of them being Sánchez - who use blogs and social networks to spread information from their countries living under authoritarian regimes , thus fighting for women rights or human rights in general . Sánchez was also invited to a discussion at the Charles University about independent journalism in Cuba . 
 = = Blogging and digital publishing = = 
 Sánchez established the magazine , <unk> ( later named Contodos ) , on her return from Switzerland . The magazine continues to be published today as a " forum for free expression " from the island , and as a vehicle for the reporting of news such as Father Jose Conrado ’ s February 2009 letter to Raúl Castro Ruz . The magazine 's editorial board consists of Dimas Castellanos , Miriam <unk> , Marta <unk> , Reinaldo Escobar , Eugenio Leal , and Yoani Sánchez . Sánchez is also involved with the digital magazine <unk> . 
 In January – February 2007 , Sánchez participated in an event referred to as the " debate of the intellectuals " , described as a " discussion among intellectuals and writers on Cuba ’ s repressive cultural policies . " She , along with several others , was not allowed into the formal conference being held in the House of The Americas . The debate of those who were excluded , and included , in the formal sessions , was captured in a several hundred pages of emails exchanged between the participants . These emails — exchanged by over one hundred participants — are preserved in the digital magazine Contodos , under the title : <unk> Intellectual 2007 . 
 According to Sánchez , what pushed her to write a blog was the bad taste left at the end of the controversy of the intellectuals in January 2007 . The meeting in the House of the Americas would try to channel and institutionalize a debate that had been raising the temperature of Cuban emails for a couple of weeks already . A select list of guests began entering the " Che Guevara Room " , while our “ group of <unk> ” watched , from outside , as midnight arrived . The protesters were blocked from entering by the custodians in order to keep them from debating and discussing their encounters with " censorship and dogmatism . " The protesters chanted “ Desiderio , Desiderio , hear my criteria , ” but this had no effect , while inside , the voice of the Minister of Culture repeated the idea that in a place under siege , dissent is treason . Sánchez believed that the " debate was hijacked by the institutions , jailed by an academic world full of concepts and fancy words , and condemned to take the course of the imminent conference of the <unk> [ Cuban Writers and Artists Union ] . 
 In the end the protesters left with the conviction that they couldn 't wait to be allowed inside for the next debate . For Sánchez , this added a push to start what she terms " this exorcism called Generation Y. " Sánchez launched her blog , Generation Y , on April 9 , 2007 . The national baseball playoffs were underway , and the first post used the baseball fever to compare what Cubans are allowed to shout , and display on homemade posters , “ Santiago , Go Santiago ! ” and what they are not : “ Internet for all ! ” The blog was hosted in Germany on an Internet domain by Cronon AG , and was designed by Sánchez . Later , the blog was transferred to WordPress , and was eventually upgraded to allow comments by readers . 
 When the blog had been active for six months , Sánchez expressed her reason for blogging , saying that her initial inspiration had been to create an aid to help her deal with the frustrations she felt with the situation in Cuba , and of trying to go along with the advice of friends who suggested she be cautious and wait , rather than more " noble motives " . She tried " silence and evasion , " yoga , Tai Chi , going to the gym , all with no results . She finally found a means to express these frustrations , by blogging . Even so , she admits " I can both get discouraged have sudden starts . I alternate between “ It ‘ s working ! ” to “ It ’ s not worth the pain ” ; alerting her readers to not be " surprised if the catharsis rises in tone , if I become incendiary , or show a streak of pessimism . " 
 According to Sánchez , when she began blogging , Cubans , by law , were not allowed into tourist hotels , but with her “ European ” appearance , and ability to speak German , she routinely managed to get past the gatekeepers to work on her blog . Due to the difficulties in accessing the Internet , her access speed is determined by the speed of the bus that connects to La <unk> at Línea and G. " Each post depends on a countless chain of events that normally don ’ t go well . From my isolated PC to a flash memory and then to the public space of a <unk> or a hotel . For this , without detailing all the complications , the elevator does not work , the gatekeeper asks me to show my passport to sit at the computer , or there are frustrations to sign on , plus the slow @-@ speeds imposed by proxies , filters and keylogger . " 
 = = = The Huffington Post blog = = = 
 In November 2008 , Sánchez was invited to post her blog entries on The Huffington Post , and she began writing occasional posts that described life in Cuba . Sánchez says she has strived to maintain a respectful tone , and she asks that those who leave comments on her blog do so as well . 
 In an interview with journalist Ted <unk> published in <unk> , she explained this view , saying : 
 I refuse to use incendiary language , defamation , or harangues , because that only exacerbates the cycle of intolerance that is an obstacle to reasoned debate . Cuba is a very diverse country . You walk out into the street , and you not only find diversity of races but also of opinions . The official press spends all its time trying to make us believe that this is a very monolithic country , that we all think the same , and it does so with a dose of revolutionary violence and ideological aggressiveness that is paralyzing . We have to find a way to put a stop to this never @-@ ending cycle , to this spiral of aggression that is very characteristic of Cuban journalism . 
 = = = International attention = = = 
 On October 9 , 2007 , Reuters published an article about bloggers in Cuba : " Cubans go to unusual lengths to post blogs " ; Sánchez featured prominently in the article . The article was republished by media around the world , and was followed by a Wall Street Journal article on December 22 , 2007 , called " Cuban Revolution : Yoani Sánchez fights tropical totalitarianism , one blog post at a time " . Sánchez has also appeared in interviews by Spain 's El País newspaper ; in an article in Germany 's Die Zeit ; and in the New York Times . 
 = = = Generation Y blocked = = = 
 On March 26 , 2008 , Sánchez announced to her readers that the recent problems accessing her blog appeared to be a deliberate action on the part of government censors to block access to her blog and the other blogs on the <unk> website . While debate swirled back and forth on the web about whether the site was actually blocked , Sanchez stated that Generation Y could not be accessed in Cuba for the past several years . The debate about whether this was a year @-@ long plus “ fluke ” or some “ glitch ” in the software , seemed to be resolved about a year after the site became unavailable . Comments made by a Cuban State Security agent in an interview published on March 19 , 2009 , in the digital magazine Kaos en la Red , where “ Agent Miguel ” stated , “ I know State Security officials who literally prophesied that blocking the blog Generation Y within the country would , in a short time , cause the launching of Madame Sánchez into the stardom of the manipulative media campaign against Cuba . Regardless of these prophesies , they did it and now they ’ re paying the price . ” 
 Sánchez was well known by this time and the attempt to censor her by the sudden government shutdown of her blog attracted more international attention than ever . On April 2 , 2008 , the Washington Post devoted a long column to her , just one of hundreds of articles and blog posts appearing around the world . On June 23 , 2008 , Cuba ’ s daily newspaper , Granma , published a lengthy prologue , written by Fidel Castro , to the book Fidel , Bolivia y <unk> más , which had been re @-@ issued fifteen years after its initial publication . In a prologue to this new edition of a book commemorating his visit to Bolivia in 1993 , Fidel Castro took the opportunity to quote a long excerpt from Sánchez 's blog and , although he did not mention her name , expressed his disappointment that there are young persons in Cuba today who think as she does . Castro describes Sánchez 's statements as a generalization used as a slogan . 
 Sánchez responded to Castro 's comments by saying in her blog that she would allow her husband , journalist Reinaldo Escobar , to respond to Castro 's statements because she felt it best to leave the fighting at the " macho @-@ man @-@ male " level , and instead continue with her " womanly " labor of weaving together the " frayed tapestry " of their society . Sánchez 's husband responded with : 
 The ex @-@ president disapproves of the fact that Yoani accepted this year ’ s Ortega y Gasset Prize for Digital Journalism , arguing that the prize is something that imperialism favours to blow its own horn . I recognize the right of this gentleman to make this comment , but I allow myself to observe that the responsibility implied in receiving a prize is never comparable to that of bestowing one , and Yoani , at least , has never awarded a medal to a corrupt person , a traitor , a dictator or a murderer . 
 Escobar went on to enumerate a list of names he says are " terrible and undeserving " recipients who were awarded the Order of José Marti by Castro , including names such as Leonid Brezhnev , Nicolae Ceaușescu , Gustáv Husák , and Robert Mugabe , among others . 
 = = = Blogging blind = = = 
 Since her blog was blocked from public Internet sites in Cuba , Sánchez has relied on Cuban friends abroad to post her texts for her , which she sends to them by email , along with the accompanying photographs . In an 2009 interview with Ted <unk> published in <unk> , Sánchez commented on being a " blind blogger " by saying that the Cuban government “ filtered ” the <unk> website from the Internet , including access from hotels in order to prevent Sánchez from updating her site . To combat this , Sánchez developed what she terms a “ citizen network ” , consisting of people outside Cuba who help distribute her posts . 
 As of January 2009 , Generation Y ( all languages ) was getting about 14 million ' hits ' a month . On the Spanish language site , each entry receives hundreds , if not thousands , of comments .

 On 21 May 2014 , Sánchez launched <unk> , the first independent digital media outlet in Cuba . Shortly after the launch , the website was blocked by the Cuban government but was later unblocked again . 
 = = Books = = 
 In 2011 , Sanchez published her first book Havana Real : One Woman Fights to Tell the Truth About Cuba Today , four years ' worth of her translated blog collected in book form , and which describes her views on everyday life in Cuba under the rule of both Fidel and Raúl Castro . She was not able to leave Cuba to promote her book , but smuggled flash drives out of Cuba containing videotaped book readings . She has written a second book , Word Press : A Blog for Speaking To The World . Sanchez has been described as a talented writer . 
 = = Growing the Cuban blogosphere = = 
 Given the challenges of blogging in Cuba , the number of blogs on the <unk> site grew quickly . Eight months after she started Generation Y , she was joined on the <unk> website by her husband Reinaldo Escobar 's blog , Desde Aqui ( From Here ) , in December 2007 . In January three more <unk> blogs were launched : Sin <unk> ( Without Evasion ) ; El Blog de Dimas ( The Blog of Dimas ) ; and <unk> ( Fragments ) . In March 2008 , Potro Salvaje ( Wild Pony ) was launched , joined by La <unk> ( The Beehive ) in May 2008 . 
 When the Cuban government blocked access to Sánchez 's blog from the island , it also blocked access to the <unk> website , where these other blogs were housed . The other bloggers faced the same challenges Sánchez had in maintaining their blogs , and also needed to find ways around the censorship — either relying on friends with access inside Cuba from their government offices , using complex and time @-@ consuming workarounds to find ' back doors ' into their blogs , or reaching out to friends and strangers abroad who volunteered to help , and who posted email blog entries they would never be able to see . With their blogs targeted to Cuban readers on the island , the discouragement was compounded by knowing that even if they could post , their readers could not read the posts . This limitation was circumvented by making copies of the blogs on CDs , either from computers on the island with access to the website , or sent from friends abroad . Although this method of disseminating the blogs was slow and delayed , and readers could not comment directly on the website , it was quite effective and continues to this day [ March 2009 ] . <unk> said to a known Venezuelan blogger that visited her in Havana : " In any case we are trying to educate others so blogging would become in Cuba a permanent feature , a means of democratizing citizen expression , as in the free world . " 
 On January 28 , Sánchez launched Voces <unk> . This citizen journalism project seeks to provide a multimedia platform to independent bloggers in Cuba to express the realities and hardships of everyday life there . During an interview published by Global Voices , Sánchez said this was a website " where all those who want to express ideas , put their projects online , can do so . " An article in El Nuevo Herald by <unk> Leyva Martinez , speaks to the role played by Sánchez and other young people , outside the Cuban opposition and dissidence movements , in working towards a free and democratic Cuba today . On March 29 , 2009 , at a performance by Tania Bruguera , a podium with an open microphone was staged for those wishing to have one minute of uncensored , public speech . Sánchez was among speakers who publicly criticized censorship and said that " the time has come to jump over the wall of control " . The Communist regime dismissed the event and Sánchez without using her name .

 On February 5 , 2009 , Father José Conrado , Pastor of Santa <unk> del Niño Jesús in Santiago de Cuba , wrote an open letter to Cuban president Raúl Castro Ruz which was published in the digital magazine , Contodos . 
 Sánchez and Escobar traveled to Santiago de Cuba the weekend before the letter was released and spent several days there , meeting with Father Conrado . During the same visit they held a blogger meeting with young people there , and Sánchez put her Ortega y Gasset award in the sanctuary of the Virgin of Charity of Cobre , where “ the long arm of the censor does not enter . ” Excerpts from the letter were published on the Huffington Post .

 According to Sánchez , on Friday , November 6 , 2009 , she and three others were taken in her own neighborhood by men working for the Cuban government . She said that she was heading to an anti @-@ violence demonstration and was forcefully put into a car along with another Cuban blogger , Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo ( she stated that the other two were placed into another car ) . She characterizes the event on her blog , Generation Y , as a " kidnapping " and describes the event in detail . Sánchez said that when she was accosted on the street , " The curious crowded around and I shouted , ' Help , these men want to kidnap us , ' but they stopped those who wanted to intervene with a shout that revealed the whole ideological background of the operation , ' Don ’ t mess with it , these are counterrevolutionaries . ' " Sánchez said that she was put into the backseat of the car and received blows to her head , legs and buttocks as she was pinned down . The incident was condemned by the U.S. administration and by Human Rights Watch . 
 According to BBC reporter Fernando <unk> , who interviewed Sánchez on Monday , November 9 , 2009 , he did not see bruises , marks or scars on her body . When asked , she explained , " Throughout the weekend I had a swollen cheekbone and eyebrow . Above all I have a lot of pain in the lower back . " She still had marks on her buttocks however , which she couldn 't show to the reporter . She attributed that to the " skill of her captors " . When CNN 's David Ariosto reported on the incident , after Sánchez was injured but before she met with the BBC reporter , Sánchez is shown in video footage with bruising and swelling around her left eye and bruising on her arm . The video report appeared on CNN Espanol on Monday , November 9 , 2009 .

 In 2009 , Sánchez mailed seven questions to United States President Barack Obama . On November 18 , 2009 , Obama responded to these questions with a detailed expression of his support for the bloggers ' work : 
 Your blog provides the world a unique window into the realities of daily life in Cuba . It is telling that the Internet has provided you and other courageous Cuban bloggers with an outlet to express yourself so freely , and I applaud your collective efforts to empower fellow Cubans to express themselves through the use of technology . The government and people of the United States join all of you in looking forward to the day all Cubans can freely express themselves in public without fear and without reprisals . 
 The day after she received the unexpected answers from President Obama , Sanchez drafted seven questions for President Castro that she left with the council of state , supreme governing body for Cuba .

 With a change in the passport laws in January 2013 , Sánchez was granted a Cuban passport enabling her to travel abroad . She had previously applied for an exit permit 20 times without success .

She returned to Cuba on May 30 .

 In 2008 , Sánchez was honored with awards that included Time magazine ’ s " One of the 100 Most Influential People in the World ” , one of Foreign Policy magazine ’ s “ 10 Most Influential Latin American Intellectuals ” of the year , and the El País 2008 “ Ortega y Gasset Prize for Digital Journalism ” . She was , as well , one of El País ’ 2008 100 most notable <unk> , and one of <unk> ’ s 10 most influential people of 2008 . 
 Time magazine named Sánchez 's blog , " Generation Y " , one of the “ 25 Best Blogs of 2009 ” . The World Economic Forum , yearly , selects a group of young global leaders of whom Sánchez was one , in 2009 .

 No. 285 Squadron is responsible for training aircrew and maintenance staff to operate the Lockheed Martin C @-@ 130J Hercules transport aircraft of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . It is located at RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales , and controlled by No. 84 Wing , which is part of Air Mobility Group . No. 285 Squadron 's motto is " Aspire " . 
 Twelve C @-@ 130Js are operated by No. 37 Squadron , also based at Richmond under No. 84 Wing . The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster , and are tasked with medium tactical airlift in Australia and overseas , transporting troops and cargo , and conducting medical evacuation , search @-@ and @-@ rescue , and airdrop missions . No. 285 Squadron manages the full @-@ flight mission simulator ( FFMS ) used to convert aircrew to the C @-@ 130J , as well as decommissioned Hercules airframes used for loadmaster training . It also employs computer @-@ based training tools and is allocated flying aircraft from No. 37 Squadron when required . As well as training aircrew new to the C @-@ 130J , the FFMS ( maintained by CAE Australia ) is employed for existing aircrew to maintain their currency . 
 No. 285 Squadron generally holds two pilot and navigator conversion courses per year . Each six @-@ month course includes approximately 120 hours in the FFMS and 30 hours in flying aircraft . It culminates in an airborne operation module , which includes formation flying , airdrops , night landings with night @-@ vision goggles , and simulated combat utilising the C @-@ 130 's self @-@ defence systems to prepare the aircrew for conditions in Middle East deployments . Following this exercise , the new C @-@ 130 aircrew are posted to No. 37 Squadron . No. 285 Squadron may run 30 or more courses each year for ground support staff ; these courses can last from one day to five weeks .

 No. 285 Squadron was formed on 24 August 1999 at RAAF Base Richmond under the command of Squadron Leader Peter " Zip " Szypula . Coming under the control of the newly re @-@ formed No. 85 Wing , the squadron took over the training functions of No. 33 Squadron ( operating Boeing 707s ) , No. 36 Squadron ( C @-@ 130H Hercules ) , No. 37 Squadron ( C @-@ 130J Hercules ) and No. 503 Wing ( aircraft maintenance ) . It was equipped with three flight simulators ; one 707 , one C @-@ 130H and one C @-@ 130J . The squadron began operating a full @-@ flight mission simulator ( FFMS ) for the C @-@ 130Hs in 2003 , coinciding with the deployment of C @-@ 130Hs to the Middle East . Replacing a more basic C @-@ 130H simulator , the FFMS was used to train pilots , navigators and flight engineers . By mid @-@ 2006 , No. 85 Wing had been disbanded and No. 285 Squadron was under the control of No. 84 Wing at Richmond . RAAF Hercules operations were concentrated in No. 37 Squadron in November 2006 , when No. 36 Squadron transferred its C @-@ 130Hs prior to re @-@ equipping with Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster III heavy airlifters and relocating to RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland . 
 The Boeing 707 was retired from service in June 2008 . In April 2009 , No. 285 Squadron was named the most proficient RAAF training unit of the previous year . No. 37 Squadron joined No. 285 Squadron under No. 84 Wing in October 2010 , when it was transferred from No. 86 Wing . The C @-@ 130Hs were retired in 2012 , and with them No. 285 Squadron 's C @-@ 130H simulator ; the simulator remained at Richmond until 2016 , when it was sent to Jakarta to support training for the Indonesian Air Force 's fleet of ex @-@ RAAF C @-@ 130Hs . No. 285 Squadron was jointly responsible ( with No. 33 Squadron ) for training flight attendants for the RAAF 's VIP jets until 2015 , when No. 34 Squadron established its own training section and took over the task . The C @-@ 130J FFMS was networked to a virtual exercise in August 2015 , allowing aircrew operating the simulator at No. 285 Squadron to interact for the first time with other exercise participants in Australia , the US and the UK . By February 2016 , according to No. 285 Squadron 's commanding officer , ninety per cent of C @-@ 130 flying training was conducted in the FFMS . In March , a commemorative cairn and garden was unveiled at Richmond in tribute to the squadron 's inaugural commanding officer , " Zip " Szypula , who died in March 2001 with his partner and her daughter in an avalanche in the Himalayas , while preparing to climb Mount Everest . 
 = Homesick ( A Day to Remember album ) = 
 Homesick is the third studio album by American rock band A Day to Remember , produced by Chad Gilbert and the band , and released in February 2009 . It was the band 's second album for Victory . The album features material written while the band had been touring , which Andrew Wade helped them demo . Recording took place between October and November 2008 at The Wade Studio , located in Ocala . Featured on the album are guest vocalists Mike <unk> ( The Devil Wears Prada ) , Vincent Bennett ( The Acacia Strain ) and Sierra <unk> ( VersaEmerge ) . Recorded during the album sessions but remaining unreleased is an instrumental called " Money Maker " . Several of the album 's songs appeared on the band 's MySpace profile before the release of the album . 
 Planned for a mid @-@ February 2009 release by Victory before being moved forward two weeks , the album sold 22 @,@ 000 copies in the first week and charted at number 21 on the U.S. Billboard 200 . It also charted at number 165 in the UK . It was the band 's final album featuring Tom Denney on guitar , who was replaced on tour by Kevin Skaff . Three singles were released from the album : " NJ Legion Iced Tea " in January 2009 , " The Downfall of Us All " in March 2009 , " Have Faith in Me " in August 2009 . Only the third of these charted , at number 40 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart . A re @-@ release with additional tracks was released in October 2009 . Several of the album tracks are available for Rock Band . In 2014 , two songs from the album , " The Downfall of Us All " and " If It Means a Lot to You " , were certified gold by the RIAA . The album was certified Silver in the UK by the BPI in 2015 , and Gold in the United States the following year . 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 A Day to Remember were pressed for a new album by their record label , Victory , in early 2008 ; bassist Joshua Woodard said the band weren 't ready to record a new album at the time . This resulted in a re @-@ release of their previous album , For Those Who Have Heart ( 2007 ) , with additional tracks . The songs featured on Homesick were written while the band were on Warped Tour 2008 and on the <unk> Tour with producer Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory . The songs were finished on the latter tour . Gilbert helped to structure the band 's songs and also assisted the band with composing " a few really catchy parts " . The album 's lyrics are similar to their previous efforts , with the band aiming to " keep it as personal and open at the same time " , as vocalist Jeremy McKinnon commented . Speaking of the album 's sound , McKinnon said that the band " wanted to make sure it was heavier and poppier " while at the same time trying " to take it to the next level " .

 In the early hours of one morning , McKinnon was driving to Ocala , Florida when the chorus guitar riff to " The Downfall of Us All " came to him , sometime in September 2008 . Upon arriving at his mom 's house , he got an acoustic guitar and worked the song out , finishing it within 2 days . The song 's lyrics are about pressure when it comes to songwriting and the attempt to make people happy because of it . It was the last song written for the album . " My Life for Hire " was one of the first songs written for the album , but remained unfinished until shortly before recording sessions began . The lyrics refer to the music business and how the band were told that they couldn 't " be the band we wanted to be " , as McKinnon commented . The title " I 'm Made of Wax , Larry , What Are You Made Of ? " was a quote that McKinnon " thought was cool " , from the movie Night at the Museum , while the lyrics are about getting revenge . " NJ Legion Iced Tea " refers to how someone would feel watching gigs . The title for " Mr. Highway 's Thinking About the End " also comes from a movie , The Good Son , while the lyrics are about people attempting to undermine your achievements . " Have Faith in Me " is about trusting other people , and looking after them . 
 = = = Tracks 7 – 12 = = = 
 " Welcome to the Family " features a recording of Andrew Wade 's heart beat towards the end of the track . The title track , " Homesick " , was written as one piece , before being split into two songs , which the band thought didn 't work well and changed it back to one song . McKinnon said he was " proud " of the track : " My parents were really happy when they first heard it : My dad is always worried about me and my mom really did ask me to write her some soft songs . I finally did . " " Holdin ' It Down for the Underground " came about after McKinnon lost two family members and writing the song helped him relieve the pain . 
 " You Already Know What You Are " is about negative people and music critics , and doing whatever you want no matter what others say . The song 's title was a saying from a friend of the band . The title for " Another Song About the Weekend " is a reference to Secret Lives of the Freemasons 's album Weekend Warriors ( 2008 ) , while the lyrics are about " a sick cycle " of " life on the road [ ... ] Every time you 're gone , you miss home and when you get home , you miss the road " . " If It Means a Lot to You " had been written over the course of a year , and McKinnon said he wrote it about himself . McKinnon described the song as a " great way to end " the album , describing it as one of their " biggest songs . " 
 = = Recording = = 
 In an August 2008 interview with AbsolutePunk , McKinnon said the band were planning to start recording once the tour with New Found Glory had finished , " So Oct & Nov. " McKinnon said that having Wade , who had previously worked on the band 's other albums , on production duties , was a way for the album to have " A Day To Remember @-@ type feel " . Wade also recorded the band 's demos for the album , in the back of a bus . The album itself was recorded at Wade 's The Wade Studio , in Ocala , Florida , after the <unk> Tour had finished . Gilbert was touring with New Found Glory in Europe at the time , but with video conferencing he was able to offer input about the record . In September 2008 , a demo appeared on the band 's MySpace page , entitled " Wax Larry " . Documenting the recording process , the band released several webisodes on YouTube , under the name The Real <unk> : Homesick in Ocala , which had been called a spoof of The Real World . The webisodes were aided by director Drew Russ , as guitarist Neil Westfall states : " When he [ Drew Russ ] was telling us in the beginning that he was getting into video stuff , and we were like ' Well that 's kinda crazy ' cause we need a video guy to do these webisodes for us ' . And as we started talking he really kinda got our sense of humor " . While in the middle of recording Homesick , A Day to Remember released Old Record . 
 Homesick was produced by Gilbert , and was mixed by Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage , with mixing taking place in December 2008 , at Zing Studios . Mastering took place at West West Side Studios , by Alan Douches . The album features three guesting vocalists : Mike <unk> of The Devil Wears Prada on " I 'm Made of Wax , Larry , What Are You Made Of ? " , Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain on " Welcome to the Family " , and Sierra <unk> of VersaEmerge on " If It Means a Lot to You " . The latter featured harmonica played by Dave <unk> . One of the tracks written for Homesick was held over for What Separates Me from You ( 2010 ) . An instrumental entitled " Money Maker " was also recorded during the sessions , but McKinnon had difficulties with it . He later explained : " when it came down to writing vocal parts [ ... ] I just couldn 't get that song done . [ ... ] I think it was the best music for the whole record . The music was just so catchy on its own [ ... ] so we said we will just set this aside for next time around . "

 In 2008 , both Homesick and the re @-@ release of the band 's first album , as Old Record , were announced , with a further announcement claiming Homesick 's release as February 17 , 2009 . After being moved up the schedule , the album 's release date became February 3 for the U.S. In January 6 , 2009 , the track list of the album was revealed . In mid @-@ January , the song " Welcome to the Family " was put on the band 's Myspace profile , with " The Downfall of Us All " being added on 26 January . The following day , the song " NJ Legion Iced Tea " was released as the first single . Homesick was released on February 3 in the U.S. The cover art , designed by Dan Mumford based on an idea by McKinnon , is an interpretation of different paths in life , and how one road can change a person 's life . The second single was " The Downfall of Us All " and the music video was released on March 3 . " The Downfall of Us All " impacted radio on May 26 . For tours in promotion of Homesick , the band had a line @-@ up change adding Four Letter Lie guitarist Kevin Skaff and dropping Tom Denney , the latter of whom wanted to settle down , but was still working with the band behind the scenes . 
 The band called " The Downfall of Us All " the " most fun " track from Homesick to play live . A live video of the band performing " Mr. Highway 's Thinking About the End " was included in an episode of Victory 's <unk> . A video of the band performing " I 'm Made of Wax , Larry , What Are You Made Of ? " , which was filmed on the Warped Tour , was added to the band 's MySpace profile on October 16 , 2009 . It was included as a DVD trailer on their profile , which people mistook as the song 's actual music video . " Have Faith in Me " was then announced as a single on September 25 , 2009 . In December , the band released a Christmas song , " Right Where You Want Me to Be " , on their MySpace account .

 Also in December , the music video for " I 'm Made of Wax , Larry , What Are You Made Of ? " was filmed , directed by Dan Dobi . In early March 2010 the band announced via their Twitter account that the video was set for release , with a date of March 16 . This was further confirmed a few days later , with some fans being able to view it before its release . A delay in releasing it occurred as the band were trying to negotiate with MTV , as Westfall commented : " I think it 's more important to have them [ MTV ] on board , instead of just putting it on , like , YouTube . " The video had its television premiere on MTV on March 16 . The music video was based on an idea from a friend Kyle Crawford , as McKinnon said : " He was like , ' Hey , you should totally make a video where you guys are playing kickball and you play a bunch of kids and just kick the s * * * out of them ? " I was like , " That is a great idea . Let 's look into it . ' " Asked why it was the band 's next music video , Westfall said " it stands out compared to the other songs " as " it 's a harder song . " 
 The band had performed acoustic versions of both " Homesick " and " Have Faith in Me " before a show in early April , for 98 Rock , and again , for KROQ , a few months later . The band also played " Have Faith in Me " acoustically for MTV , which was posted online mid @-@ April . At the beginning of May 2010 , the band asked fans to name their next tour , which was shortly afterwards named as <unk> . The band started the first of The AP Sessions for Alternative Press on June 30 , performing " Homesick " and " Have Faith in Me " . The music video for " Have Faith in Me " , directed by Mark Staubach , was released on July 14 , receiving its world premiere on MTV . The song was also released as a single .

The acoustic tracks were recorded at The Wade Studio from September 10 to September 21 . Westfall said the band wasn 't going to re @-@ issue the album " unless it 's worth the fans ' while .

 Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk called Homesick " a record that is honest and entertaining " , despite how " repetitive " and " dense it may be " . Nassiff went on to say that the album wouldn 't appeal to the public , but it would be " welcomed with open arms " by the band 's fans . When referring to the album 's lyrics , Nassiff called the album " a concept one " , with a theme of " the glory of being a musician " , which encompasses having to be away from home for a period of time . " The Downfall of Us All " , as Nassiff put it , " gets the listener psyched for the rest of the album " . Rock on Request reviewer Anthony <unk> furthered this comment by naming the songs " Welcome to the Family " and the title track as examples of the band showing off their " wide range of talent while producing a harmonious album " that the band 's fans " will instantly fall in love with " . <unk> noted the album had " a unique sound that has elements " from other bands such as <unk> . Petteri <unk> , for <unk> , " appreciate [ s ] the way these guys fuse metalcore and pop punk seamlessly together " , adding that " many songs are plagued by an overtly formulaic approach , but when it works , [ ... ] Homesick is one of the catchiest listens you 'll experience this year . " Punknews.org reviewer Elliot said the album had an " undeniable quality " , that is " melodic competence " . He viewed the a capella intro to " The Downfall of Us All " as being " a little gimmicky " , while " Have Faith in Me " was called a tribute to Blink @-@ 182 . Despite noting that three of the songs " stray " from a format that the other songs on the album share , he referred to them as being " not very impressive " . 
 Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger said " The Downfall of Us All " would gain an extra " life in countless montages on MTV reality shows and 30 @-@ second cola commercials " . Monger said that the album consisted " of perfectly executed and fairly standard clean vocal post @-@ hardcore emo @-@ pop " which shows the " limitations of the genre " . Monger called the backing vocals " exciting at first " , but felt that they " eventually dissolve into the waves of distortion mid @-@ album " , becoming an " audio equivalent of an energy drink crash " . The final track , " If It Means a Lot to You " , as Monger noted , was different from the preceding tracks , as they were " deafening , ultimately forgettable , over @-@ compressed slabs of twentysomething angst " . Sputnikmusic 's John Hanson said the album was an " incredibly derivative and plodding record " that was filled with " laughable moments " . He also noted the band " haven 't seemed to progress that basic combination of ideas " in combining pop @-@ punk and metalcore , and that the intro to " The Downfall of Us All " is " just one example of embarrassing decisions " .

 L.A.P.D. ( Love And Peace Dude , later Laughing As People Die ) was an American funk metal band formed in 1989 in Bakersfield , California . From 1989 to 1991 , the member line @-@ up was James Shaffer , Reginald Arvizu , David Silveria and Richard Morrill . The group has released one studio album , one extended play , and one compilation album . 
 The band was originally formed by Shaffer , Arvizu , and Morrill . Capra approached the band introducing them to bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More . Still in need for a drummer , the band placed an advertisement in a local newspaper which was answered by Silveria . Shortly after this , the band recorded a demo album which was meant to be sent out to record companies . Realizing they would have to continue the band in a more populated area in order for them to expand , all of the members but Shaffer left Bakersfield and resided in Hollywood , Los Angeles , California ( Shaffer later moved to Hollywood as well ) . In late 1989 , the band hired a man named Arthur as their manager , resulting in them getting signed to Triple X Records . The band recorded and released their first extended play in 1989 , but it suffered from poor distribution . 
 In 1991 , they released Who 's Laughing Now , their first full @-@ length studio album . Shortly after the album 's release , Capra left the band and was replaced by someone only noted by his first name Corey . Corey was fired from the band several weeks later . After this , Morrill quit the band , and the rest of the group set out to form the band Korn with two other people . Several of the band 's former members have formed solo projects . In 1997 , a compilation album consisting of fourteen tracks was released .

 L.A.P.D. formed in Bakersfield , California , in 1989 . The band was started with Richard Morrill , James Shaffer , and Reginald Arvizu . With both guitarist and bass guitar positions filled , there was still a need for a lead vocalist , as well as a percussionist . The group asked Pete Capra to join their band . Capra joined the band and was positioned as lead vocalist . Although he had not been a vocalist for other bands , Capra introduced the group to bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More . The group was inspired by the bands that Capra had shown them , and committed to head into those band 's genres and style . 
 The band still needed a drummer , so they put an ad in a local newspaper . The ad description stated that they were a " funk , thrash , metal groove band looking for a drummer . " This resulted in David Silveria auditioning for the band . Although at the time Silveria was only fifteen , he was still recruited to the band , filling the percussionist position . L.A.P.D. recorded a demo album consisting of four songs , " James Brown " , " <unk> Like a Bee " , " Jesus " , and " Don 't Label Me " , which were all ready to be sent out to various record labels . 
 The group left Bakersfield and set out for Los Angeles , California . Shaffer was the only band member that was not in favor of the act . He was the only one to stay in Bakersfield , while all the other band members left . Silveria dropped out of high school to leave Bakersfield . L.A.P.D. began rehearsing at a space located in Hollywood , California , near Western Avenue . Shaffer decided to return to the band when he and his girlfriend broke up . Brian Welch , a guitarist who knew Shaffer and Arvizu when they were in high school ( and who later joined the band when they reformed as Korn ) , would occasionally " check out the [ band 's ] music scene . " At the time , Welch was a member of the band Creep .

 L.A.P.D. was performing at several gigs in Hollywood throughout their self @-@ titled EP era . After one of their shows , a local and drumming protege of Gene Krupa known as Arthur Von Blomberg was positioned as manager . After the group was kicked out of their original studio for not paying the rent on time , they quickly found another practice space in Santa Monica , California . In 1990 , their manager introduced them to Triple X Records , an independent Los Angeles based record company that has signed artists such as Dr. Dre , Social Distortion , Jane 's Addiction , and The Vandals . The company offered them a contract after seeing them in concert . Bassist Arvizu described the contract as " pitiful , " but L.A.P.D. still signed and began recording their album . According to Arvizu , the record company did not distribute the album properly . In 1989 , the group released their first EP Love and Peace Dude through Triple X Records . 
 In 1991 , L.A.P.D. recorded their second album , Who 's Laughing Now . Released on May 3 , 1991 , it was their first full @-@ length studio album , and consisted of eleven tracks . After they recorded the album , the group 's lead vocalist , Pete Capra , left L.A.P.D. and was replaced by someone affectionately known by other band members as Corey . Bassist Arvizu wrote : " Pete [ Capra ] was always doing amphetamines and stuff . He pretty much left just because of his drug abuse . So Munky [ Shaffer ] , David [ Silveria ] , and I had to start all over again . " The band later fired Corey after his behavior during an audition with producer Ross Robinson . While looking for a new singer , they heard Jonathan Davis singing for the alternative metal band <unk> . After the show , the remaining band members of L.A.P.D. asked him to join their band . Shortly after this , the band changed their name to Korn and added Brian Welch to the member line @-@ up .

 The band continued on through Shaffer , Arvizu , and Silveria , who soon added Jonathan Davis as lead singer and Brian Welch as another guitarist . Bassist Reginald Arvizu , ( now known better as " Fieldy " ) released a solo album entitled Rock 'n Roll Gangster on January 22 , 2002 . In 2006 , Fieldy formed the band <unk> with Q @-@ Unique and P.O.D. drummer Noah " <unk> " Bernardo . Fear and the Nervous System is currently one of James Shaffer 's ( now known by band members as " Munky " ) side projects , formed in 2008 . As of 2009 , Pete Capra , Richard Morrill , remain good friends with all of L.A.P.D. ' s members . Aside from projects by the members of L.A.P.D. , in 1997 a compilation album was also released . The album featured songs from both their EP , Love and Peace Dude , and their full – length studio album , Who 's Laughing Now . In 2010 , L.A.P.D. had a short revival , when Morrill began playing with a new line @-@ up that included Derek Campbell ( guitar ) , Jason Torres ( drums ) , Troy Sandoval ( bass ) & Kevin <unk> ( dj ) in Denver , CO . The group recorded a 5 track demo , that was never officially released , but was posted on the band 's social media pages . The group split in early 2011 .

 The group considered themselves to be a " funk , thrash metal groove band " when they posted an ad in a Bakersfield newspaper .
