 Governor Mark Sanford declared a state of emergency as Charley approached landfall and issued a mandatory evacuation for residents on barrier islands and in coastal locations in Georgetown and Horry Counties . In Georgetown County , this order was focused on residents and tourists east of U.S. Route 17 , likewise for Horry County . 180 @,@ 000 people evacuated the Grand Strand . <unk> in Beaufort and Charleston Counties were shut down , and bridges in Georgetown and Horry Counties were locked down . Hampton County requested 2 @,@ 000 sandbags , that were provided by the Department of Corrections . The <unk> Correctional Institution also filled 30 @,@ 000 sandbags for potential floods . State troopers directed traffic inland from Myrtle Beach . U.S. Route 501 used a lane reversal to allow for evacuations .

 The first storm to make landfall in the state at hurricane intensity since Hurricane Hugo in 1989 , Hurricane Charley struck near Cape Romain , South Carolina as an 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) hurricane , moved offshore briefly , and made its final landfall near North Myrtle Beach as a minimal hurricane with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . With the landfalling system , five tornadoes were reported in the state . However , only two were confirmed ; one moved through the Francis Marion National Forest , downing trees along its path . Storm surge ranged from 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) – 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) , although only minor beach erosion occurred . A buoy situated 41 nmi ( 47 mi ) southeast of Charleston recorded 16 ft ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) seas and 74 miles per hour ( 119 km / h ) winds . 
 Peak winds in the state were clocked at 63 mph ( 101 km / h ) at the Isle of Palms . The storm spawned winds of 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) at Folly Beach and 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) in downtown Charleston . Trees , limbs and electrical poles were knocked down in those regions . Trees were blown onto U.S. Route 17 in Mount Pleasant , and awnings were torn off of a few structures . A total of 2 @,@ 231 houses were damaged ; <unk> of these were severely damaged and 40 were destroyed . Two @-@ hundred and twenty @-@ one of those damaged were beach front structures on Sunset Beach . Businesses had broken windows , six hotels had roof and outer wall damage . This led to $ 30 million ( 2004 USD ) in hotel profit loss in Myrtle Beach , primarily along U.S. Route 17 . 
 As dry air from northern sections of the state wrapped into the circulation of the storm , a band of convection developed along a frontal boundary stretching from Newberry northward . Widespread rainfall peaking at over 7 in ( 180 mm ) fell to the west of the storm 's track . In downtown Charleston , 2 @.@ 09 in ( 53 mm ) of rainfall was reported , while in Hampton 1 @.@ 53 in ( 39 mm ) of rain fell . However , the bulk of the rainfall remained offshore . With the soil still saturated from Tropical Storm Bonnie , some flooding in low @-@ lying areas of Charleston County occurred . Up to 1 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water accumulated on South Carolina Route 17 and on local streets . Flash floods were also observed in Mount Pleasant . High winds spread vegetative debris , clogging storm drains and caused further flooding . A bridge in Union County washed out following rainfall from Charley and Tropical Storm Bonnie . 135 @,@ 000 customers were without power , and storm damage totaled $ 20 million ( 2004 USD ) . 
 Following the storm , Progress Energy Carolinas assembled 1 @,@ 200 tree and power line personnel to assist in damage recovery . Federal disaster funds were approved for the counties of Georgetown and Horry . The declaration covered damage to public property on August 14 – 15 . The funding covered state and local government costs for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane .

 Nandanar ( also spelt as <unk> ) , also known as <unk> ( <unk> ) and Tiru <unk> <unk> Nayanar , was a Nayanar saint , who is venerated in the Hindu sect of Shaivism . He is the only Dalit ( " untouchable " ) saint in the Nayanars . He is generally counted as the eighteenth in the list of 63 Nayanars . Like the other Nayanars , he was a devout devotee of the god Shiva . 
 The tale of Nandanar is retold numerous times in folk tales , folk music , plays , films and literature in Tamil society . While Nandanar is included in Nayanar list since the 8th century CE , the 12th century CE Periya Puranam gives a full hagiographical account of his life . The tale focuses on two miracles attributed to him . In Sivalokanathar Temple , Tirupunkur ; his prayers are said to have moved a giant stone bull , which still appears in the moved position in the temple . Nandanar is said to have ritually purified himself by fire at Thillai Nataraja Temple , Chidambaram . <unk> 's tale features in temple lore and religious literature related to both these temples . Gopalakrishna Bharati 's 19th century retelling of the saint 's life remains the basis of many later retellings . It expands the original narrative adding elements of oppression of the Dalit saint by higher castes . While higher caste retellings of the tale focus on the saint 's observance of caste norms , Dalits emphasize his exploitation and superior religiosity . 
 Apart from collective worship Nandanar enjoys being part of the Nayanars in Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu , shrines depicted to Nandanar exist in both the sites of his miracles . The saint also became an icon of protest in Dalit rights movements . 
 = = Accounts of life = = 
 One of the most prominent Nayanars , Sundarar ( 8th century ) is the first to name Nandanar ( called Tirunalaipovar ) in literature , however Tirunalaipovar ( ' he who will go tomorrow ' ) relates to the tale of Nandanar longing to visit Chidambaram ; no details of his life are revealed . In the eleventh century , <unk> <unk> devotes a stanza to Nandanar in his <unk> <unk> while recalling the lives of the Nayanars . Tirunalaipovar is described as a <unk> ( <unk> , Pulai ) who lived in Adanur . He is said to have visited Thillai Nataraja Temple , Chidambaram of his patron god Shiva " by God 's grace " and " three thousand Brahmins ( priests ) of Chidambaram saluted him . " 
 The earliest full ( and primary religious ) account of Nandanar 's life is found in the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar ( 12th century ) , which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars , but it was the Nandanar <unk> by the Tamil poet Gopalakrishna Bharati ( 1810 – 1896 ) brought Nandanar 's tale to public attention . The Nandanar Charitam ( printed in 1861 ) , the magnum opus of Bharati , added new elements to Sekkizhar 's tale . Though it is unknown when he lived exactly , generally he is dated to 7th or 8th century CE . 
 = = = The Periya Puranam = = = 
 The Periya Puranam narrates that Nandanar belonged to Adanur ( <unk> ) in the Chola kingdom . Presently , Adanur is located in Thanjavur district , in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu . He was born in the <unk> caste , who were regarded " untouchables " ( see Dalits ) . They were agricultural labourers and singers . Another description considers Nandanar from the Dalit caste of Paraiyar , who served as labourers and were drummers as per the caste code . 
 Nandanar was born in poverty , in <unk> , the Pulai slums of Adanur . He was a staunch devotee of the god Shiva , the patron god of Shaivism . He was a leather maker , who crafted drums and other musical instruments . He also served as a village servant , a watchman , a labourer as well as the " town crier " , who used to beat the drums . In Nandanar 's times , Dalits were not allowed to enter Hindu temples . So , Nandanar would stand outside a Shiva temple and sing the praises of Shiva and dance . However , he harboured a strong urge to pay his respects to the icon of Shiva at Sivalokanathar Temple , Tirupunkur . He stood outside the temple , but a huge stone Nandi ( the bull mount of Shiva , whose sculpture is generally seen in Shiva temples , facing Shiva in the garbhagriha - sanctum sanatorium ) blocked his path of vision . The compassionate Shiva ordered Nandi to move a little to side and the bull complied , allowing the Nayanar to see the central icon of Shiva , unobstructed . Nandanar cleaned up the surroundings of the temple and dug a pond ( which serves as the temple tank ) in honour of Shiva . He circumambulated the shrine and returned to Adanur . 
 Nandanar visited many temples of Shiva and served the god . Once , he longed to visit the Thillai Nataraja Temple of Chidambaram , which enshrines Shiva as Nataraja , the Lord of Dance . He used to say everyday that he will go the next day to Chidambaram , but never actually dared to step in the holy town , where he was prohibited entry . Thus , he came to be known as " Tiru @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> " , ' he who will go tomorrow ' . Finally , Nandanar reached the boundary of Chidambaram , but feared to set foot in the town . He saw the smoke of fire sacrifices and heard the chants of the Vedic scriptures . Thinking about how he can see Nataraja 's dancing icon , the Nayanar circumambulated the town numerous times and finally succumbed to fatigue and slept . Shiva appeared in his dream and told Nandanar to enter the temple through a holy fire . The god also informed the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram to prepare a pyre . Next day , the Brahmins approached Nandanar as per the divine order . 
 Nandanar entered the holy fire chanting the name of Shiva and reappeared in a new purified form . He looked like a Brahmin sage , wearing matted hair ( characteristic of a Shaiva ) and the sacred thread worn by Brahmins across his chest . His body was smeared with sacred ash . The gods showered flowers on the Nayanar from heaven and the Brahmins cheered . With the Brahmins , Nandanar went in the garbhagriha and saw Nataraja . The Nayanar disappeared in the image of Nataraja and became one with Shiva . 
 The Periya Puranam version is interpreted as a Brahmanical narrative , where a particular Dalit is granted salvation by transforming into a Brahmin ; the superiority of the Brahmins is reinforced and the legitimacy of the ban of Dalits is not challenged . 
 <unk> , president of the Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front ( <unk> ) and an office @-@ bearer politician from the Tamil Nadu unit of Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) ( known as CPI ( M ) ) , calls the Chidambaram fire @-@ trail as Brahmin propaganda to conceal the truth that Nandanar was burnt at the stake . 
 = = = The Nandanar Charitam = = = 
 Bharati was an ardent devotee of Shiva and wrote three operas in honour of various Nayanar saints . Though Bharati was himself an upper caste Brahmin , he was a crusader for the rights of the Dalits . While Sekkizhar exalts Nandanar 's devotion to Shiva , Bharati presents the grim reality of ostracization that the Nayanar suffered . Bharati 's Nandanar is " not a rebel , but only a protester " . The Nandanar Charitam focuses on the atrocities that Nandanar and Dalits as a whole had to suffer at the hands of upper castes . The opera Nandanar Charitam was embedded with the social message that Shiva grants emancipation irrespective of caste . 
 The play starts with the term " May I come " , a warning to higher @-@ caste people that Dalits had to cry out before entering any street , so as to not pollute the higher caste members . The Nayanar first clashes with his own Dalit brethren . They oppose his devotion for the Lord of Chidambaram , whom they call a Brahmin god . The Dalit elders — headed by <unk> — define his duties as a pariah and advise him to not confront caste rules . They tell him to worship the folk deities of the pariah , instead of Shiva , the god of Brahmanical Hinduism . The Dalits also feel that Nandanar needs to abide by the social norms and give up his taboo idea of entering a temple . 
 A villainous Brahmin landlord Vetiyar ( Vediyar ) appears in Bharati 's tale . He torments his bonded labourer Nandanar and chastises him repeatedly for trying to go beyond caste norms . Vetiyar sees Nandanar 's bhakti and desire to enter a temple " not only as undesirable and irreligious , but also as a serious threat to his social status . " Vetiyar refuses to grant him permission to Chidambaram and even resorts to violence . After much persuasion , the Brahmin relents on the condition that the saint do an impossible task of cultivating and harvesting the field in one night . Aided by Shiva 's attendant ganas , the saint completes the task . The Brahmin realizes the piety of the Nayanar , apologizes to him and lets him go . 
 Bharati retained the final confrontation with the Brahmins of Chidambaram and his ritual purification by fire . Bharati concludes in a poem saying that " it is said in the epics that the Lord worshipped by Gopalakrishna granted salvation even to Untouchables ! " 
 = = = Variants = = = 
 In stories of higher caste Hindus ( especially Brahmins ) , Nandanar is a Brahmin or God himself somehow trapped in the body of an untouchable and whose true form is revealed by the fire trial . Other tales focus on his strict adherence to caste norms , his obedience of his Brahmin master and his refusal to enter the holy temple as an untouchable . 
 The Dalits strongly believe in his piety and portray Brahmins as the root cause of all the misery of the Nayanar . Nandanar fits in the Dalit narrative that proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes . They say that Nandanar was ' swallowed by God ' . The sashes round Nataraja 's waist are interpreted as the legs of the saint , who merged into the god . 
 The temple lore of Tirupunkur narrates that Shiva instructed his son Ganesha to aid Nandanar in digging the temple tank named Nandanar tirtha , after the saint . Another variant tells that Ganesha dug up the tank in the night so that Nandanar can bathe in its sacred waters before seeing Shiva in the temple . 
 In the early half of the 20th century , the novel Nandan , by A. <unk> Iyengar and G. <unk> Iyengar , includes reformist Brahmin characters that argue Nandan 's case against their peers . Nandan also echoes the reformist ideas of Hindu spiritual leaders like Ramanuja and Vivekananda , and progressive upper @-@ caste leaders . 
 The short story Puthiya Nandan by Pudhumaipithan ( 1906 @-@ 1948 ) places the classical tale of the Nayanar in a contemporary setting . While retelling Nandan 's ancient tale , it also alludes to the Dalit rights movements of Mahatma Gandhi and Periyar E. V. Ramasamy ( see Self @-@ Respect Movement ) . 
 Indira Parthasarathy 's Nandan Kathai ( 1978 ) builds the tale of Nandanar ( referred in the work as Nandan ) further , introducing two non @-@ Brahmin upper caste landholders , who are as ruthless as Bharati 's Vediyar . Nandanar is portrayed as a lover of art , rather than God . He wants to see the cosmic dance of Nataraja . A Devadasi called Abhirami also appears ; no significant female characters are found in earlier narratives . Indira is blunt in reprimanding the Dalits for not understanding Nandanar . Nandan Kathai is a quest for liberation of Dalits and women alike . Unlike earlier narratives , Indira 's tale is devoid of miracles and is a story of how Nandanar falls prey to a conspiracy . The Vediyar @-@ priest , the Vediyar @-@ landlord and the two non @-@ Brahmin upper caste landholders , hatch a plot to end Nandan . They make Nandanar believe that God harvested crop from the field , an allusion to the miracle of Vediyar 's impossible task in Bharati 's work . Then , they persuade him to organize a dance contest between Bharatnatyam , the high @-@ caste elites ' dance and the folk dance of the Dalits . Finally , in the climax , Nandanar agrees to undergo a fire @-@ trial , reassured by the earlier miracle , but he and Abhirami burn in the flames . The upper castes succeed in sending a warning to Dalits how trespassers of the caste code , longing for salvation , would be punished .

 Nandanar is specially worshipped in the Tamil month of <unk> , when the moon enters the Rohini <unk> ( lunar mansion ) . He is depicted with a shaved head , folded hands ( see Anjali mudra ) with a kamandalu and a danda ( staff ) , like a seer . He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars . Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu . Their images are taken out in procession in festivals . 
 A water tank in Chidambaram is considered sacred as it is believed to be the site of Nandanar 's fire @-@ purification . A " recently built " ( as mentioned in the 1992 book ) small shrine dedicated to the Nayanar , exists in south @-@ west part of the town , whose name means ' Nandanar has become the temple ' . A sculpture of Nandanar as a singer is found in the Chidambaram temple , besides another in Airavatesvara Temple of Darasuram ( 12th century ) depicting him in the trail by fire . 
 Sundarar venerates Nandanar in the <unk> <unk> , a hymn to Nayanar saints , calling him " <unk> " , the " holy pilgrim " who will go tomorrow . An earlier hymn to Shiva praises the god who is served by <unk> . The devotional poet Tyagaraja ( 1767 – 1847 ) also narrates the tale of Nandanar in his poems . 
 Devotional works dedicated to Nataraja of the Chidambaram temple narrate Nandanar 's tale . <unk> <unk> 's <unk> ( early fourteenth century ) mentions Nandan 's legend . While another Sanskrit work <unk> Mahatmya devotes its ninth chapter to the Nayanar . The Sthala Purana of the Nataraja temple called <unk> Mahatmya praises the god as served by Nandan . 
 The Nandi in Sivalokanathar Temple , Tirupunkur is seen placed off centre as a testimony of Nandanar 's devotion and the miracle . A stone image of the saint is worshipped in the temple . The <unk> ( gate @-@ keeper sculptures ) are depicted with his heads leaning downwards , said to be in honour of Nandanar . In 1959 , a shrine was created outside the Shiva temple , from where the stone image of Nandanar looks eternally at Shiva . Nandanar is depicted with his hands joined above his head , praying to Shiva . Scenes of Bharati 's opera and the local legend of Nandanar and Ganesha digging the temple tank are seen on the shrine . 
 = = Remembrance in society = = 
 Nandanar 's influence was and remains limited primarily to the Tamil @-@ speaking areas . The Christian missionary Rev. A. C. Clayton — who was " sympathetic " to the Dalit cause — used Nandanar 's narrative ( retold as The Legend of Nandan ) to suggest that bhakti ( devotion ) — which saw no distinction of class or caste — was the superior means to salvation than the jnana @-@ marga ( salvation by knowledge ) propagated by the Brahmins and also challenged the authority of the Brahmin orthodoxy . 
 Nandanar became " the hero of tales of caste protest " . The " Adi Dravida " ( Dalit ) leaders of the Self @-@ Respect Movement used Nandanar as an exemplar to prove that social superiority originates not from birth , but the qualities and deeds of people . In 2010 , Cadres of the Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front ( <unk> ) and the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) under the leadership of P. <unk> , protested to bring down the wall on the South Gate of the <unk> temple , which was — as per a tale — built as Nandanar entered from the gate . The walled gate was the symbol of the oppression of the Dalit caste and caste discrimination , as per the protesters who demanded its demolition . The state government — which governs the temple currently — contented that the veracity of Nandanar 's tale and its connection to the walled Gate , can not be ascertained and thus , refused the protesters ' demands . Nandanar " continues to inspire them ( Dalits ) as a symbol of resistance and a hope of a better future " . However , young Dalits identify with recent Dalit leaders like B. R. Ambedkar and are unaware or uninterested in the " obedient Nandanar " . Ambedkar , himself had dedicated his book The Untouchables , to three Dalit saints , including Nandanar . 
 In speech in Chidambaram , Mahatma Gandhi called Nandanar , a true practitioner of Satyagraha , a means of Nonviolent resistance . Gandhi said : " Nanda broke every barrier and won his way to freedom , not by brag , not by bluster , but by the purest form of self @-@ suffering ... he shamed them [ his persecutors ] into doing justice by his lofty prayer , by the purity of his character , ... he compelled God Himself to descend and made Him open the eyes of his persecutors " . 
 Nandanar 's tale is retold numerous times through folk tales , plays , literature and art forms like Villu <unk> and " musical discourses " . A number of Tamil films , all titled Nandanar , recall Nandanar 's tale following Bharati 's version . Besides a silent film in 1923 , another silent film Nandanar , subtitled The Elevation of the Downtrodden , directed by P. K. Raja Sandow , in 1930 . The first talkie film on Nandanar was made in 1931 . The 1935 film featured K. B. Sundarambal , who also performed on stage as the Nayanar numerous times . The 1942 film , starring <unk> Desikar in the lead , courted controversy for its overly Brahmin overtones and was banned in Kolar Gold Fields after protests by Dalits , however the ban was lifted after Desikar met and personally apologized to the Dalits for being part of the climax , which featured the fire @-@ purification . Another film on Nandanar was released in 1943 . Sundaram Balachander acted in the 1948 film . N. S. Krishnan presented the story as a " narrative art form " , while A. Padmanabhan released a small booklet on the saint 's life for children . C. T. Indra says that Nandanar was made immoral in legend and remembered over the years " as a strategy of public management of anxiety . ... In the <unk> way , Nandan 's devotion was cited down the ages to play down the social inequities and play up his spiritual qualifications . " 
 = M249 light machine gun = 
 The M249 light machine gun ( LMG ) , formerly designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon ( SAW ) , and formally written as Light Machine Gun , 5 @.@ 56 mm , M249 , is the American adaptation of the Belgian FN Minimi , a light machine gun manufactured by the Belgian company FN Herstal ( FN ) . The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces . The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective of a number of candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units . The M249 provides infantry squads with the heavy volume of fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle . 
 The M249 is gas operated and air @-@ cooled . It has a quick @-@ change barrel , allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel . A folding bipod is attached near the front of the gun , though an <unk> LGM tripod is available . It can be fed from both linked ammunition and <unk> magazines , like those used in the M16 and M4 . This allows the SAW gunner to use a rifleman 's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he runs out of linked rounds . 
 M249s have seen action in every major conflict involving the United States since the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989 . Soldiers are generally satisfied with the weapon 's performance , though there have been reports of clogging with dirt and sand . Due to the weight and age of the weapon , the United States Marine Corps is fielding the M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle with plans to partially replace the M249 in Marine Corps service . 
 The M249 is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a " Squad Assault Weapon " . 
 = = Development = = 
 In 1965 , the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps ' primary machine guns were the M2 Browning and M60 . The M2 was a large @-@ caliber heavy machine gun , usually mounted on vehicles or in fixed emplacements . The M60 was a more mobile medium machine gun intended to be carried with the troops to provide heavy automatic fire . Both were very heavy weapons and usually required a crew of at least two to operate efficiently . The Browning automatic rifle , the army 's main individual machine gun since its introduction in World War I , was phased out in 1957 with the introduction of the M14 rifle , which had a fully automatic mode . " Designated riflemen " in every squad were ordered to use their weapons on the fully automatic setting , while other troops were required to use their rifle 's semi @-@ automatic mode on most occasions to increase accuracy and conserve ammunition . Because the M14 and M16 rifles had not been designed with sustained automatic fire in mind , they often overheated or jammed . The 20 @-@ round and 30 @-@ round magazines of these weapons limited their sustained automatic effectiveness when compared to belt @-@ fed weapons . 
 The Army decided that an individual machine gun , lighter than the M60 , but with more firepower than the M16 , would be advantageous ; troops would no longer have to rely on rifles for automatic fire . Through the 1960s , the introduction of a machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies . While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a <unk> or dart @-@ firing Universal Machine Gun during one study , most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light machine gun , a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes . The Stoner 63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the USMC , and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs . 
 In 1968 , the Army Small Arms Program developed plans for a new 5 @.@ 56 mm caliber LMG , though no funds were allocated ( 5 @.@ 56 mm ammunition was viewed as underpowered by many in the armed forces ) . Studies of improved 5 @.@ 56 mm ammunition , with better performance characteristics , began . The earliest reference to studies of other caliber cartridges for the LMG did not appear until 1969 . In July 1970 , the U.S. Army finally approved development of an LMG , with no specified caliber . At this time , the nomenclature " Squad Automatic Weapon " ( SAW ) was introduced . Actual design of alternative cartridges for the LMG did not begin until July 1971 . A month later , Frankford Arsenal decided on two cartridge designs for the new LMG : a 6 mm cartridge and a new 5 @.@ 56 mm cartridge with a much larger case . Neither design was finalized by March 1972 , when the Army published the specifications document for the planned SAW . The 6 mm cartridge design was eventually approved in May that year . Prior to July 1972 , SAW development contracts were awarded to <unk> , Philco Ford , and the Rodman Laboratory at Rock Island Arsenal . These companies produced designs with Army designations <unk> , <unk> and XM235 respectively — X denoting " experimental " . Designs were required to have a weight of less than 9 @.@ 07 kg ( 20 lb ) including 200 rounds of ammunition , and a range of at least 800 meters ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) . 
 When the time came for developmental and operational testing of the SAW candidates , three 5 @.@ 56 mm candidate weapons were included with the 6 mm candidates : the M16 <unk> , a heavy @-@ barrel variant of the M16 designed for prolonged firing ; the Fabrique Nationale de Herstal ( FN ) Minimi ; and the HK <unk> . The initial round of tests ended in December 1974 . In February 1976 , the Minimi and Rodman XM235 SAW were selected for further development . At this time , opinions of the 6 mm cartridge were beginning to sour due to the logistical implications of providing yet another ammunition type to the infantry . In June , it was requested that the SAW specifications document be revised to emphasize standard 5 @.@ 56 mm ammunition . In October , the requested revisions were approved , and bids were solicited for the conversion of the Rodman XM235 to 5 @.@ 56 mm . Production of the converted XM235 was awarded to Ford Aerospace , and its designation was changed to <unk> . A new M16 <unk> variant , the <unk> , was developed in 1978 , and soon after , Heckler & Koch lobbied to include a 5 @.@ 56 mm conversion of its HK <unk> ( instead of the standard 7.62mm NATO ammunition it was built for ) in future SAW testing . The latter model was designated the <unk> . At this time , the Minimi received the designation XM249 . Testing of the four candidates resumed in April 1979 . 
 In May 1980 , the FN XM249 was selected as the best choice for future development on the grounds of performance and cost , while the HK <unk> reportedly came a close second . In September , FN was awarded a " maturity phase " contract for further development of the XM249 , and testing of the new weapon began in June 1981 . The official adoption took place on February 1 , 1982 . 
 The new gun entered U.S. Army service as the M249 squad automatic weapon in 1984 , and was adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps a year later . The U.S. production model has a different butt from that of the regular Minimi . It is manufactured in the FN factory in Columbia , South Carolina . 
 Although found to be reliable and accurate , the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards in the form of an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges . There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools . On August 23 , 1985 , then @-@ U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program ( PIP ) intended to fix these problems . Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget , then retroactively set aside the program 's prior year 's funds from the M249 program for other purposes , including retirement and pay raises . Over 1 @,@ 100 M249s already issued were to remain in use , but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available . Over 7 @,@ 000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made . The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented , and production of the M249 resumed . In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re @-@ designated the M249 light machine gun . 
 = = Design details = = 
 The M249 is a belt @-@ fed light machine gun . It fires the 5 @.@ 56 × 45mm NATO cartridge , usually a combination of one <unk> tracer and four <unk> ball cartridges fed from M27 linked belts . Belts are typically held in a hard plastic or soft canvas box attached to the underside of the weapon . 
 It fires from an open bolt and is gas operated . When the trigger is pulled , the bolt and bolt carrier move forward under the power of the recoil spring . A cartridge is stripped from the belt , chambered , and discharged , sending a bullet down the bore . Expanding propellant gases are diverted through a hole in the barrel into a chamber . This pressure moves a piston providing the energy to extract and eject the spent casing as well as advance the belt and compress the recoil spring , thus preparing for subsequent shots . At 1 @,@ 041 mm ( 41 in ) long and 7 @.@ 5 kg ( 17 lb ) in weight ( 10 kg ( 22 lb ) including a 200 @-@ round belt and plastic ammo box ) , the M249 is a cumbersome weapon . 
 The barrel has a rifling twist rate of one turn in 180 mm ( 7 in ) . Because firing heats up the bore , the air @-@ cooled barrel is equipped with a mechanism to remove and replace the barrel assembly with a spare . A folding bipod with adjustable legs is attached near the front of the weapon , though there are provisions for hard @-@ mounting to a <unk> Lightweight Ground Mount tripod or vehicle mount . The M249 provides accuracy approaching that of a rifle , combined with the sustained volume of fire of a machine gun . Its original gas regulator offered two different gas port sizes , allowing cyclic rates of fire of 725 @-@ rounds per minute ( r / min ) or 1 @,@ 000 r / min . The latter setting was intended for adverse conditions , such as an excessively dirty firearm or cold weather . The two @-@ position gas regulator was discarded as part of a product improvement program . Sustained rate of fire , the rate of fire at which the gunner can fire continuously without overheating , is approximately 85 r / min .

 The M249 LMG entered service in 1984 as the M249 SAW . Initial reactions to the gun were mixed : it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground , but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip . It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower , though a number of areas for improvement were highlighted : the blank firing attachment fitted poorly , the bipod was very weak and broke easily , the sling attachment was awkward , and there were many slots and gaps which accumulated dirt . Some claimed that the heavy @-@ barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun . 
 The M249 SAW was not used heavily before the 1991 Gulf War , though it has been used in every major U.S. conflict since . American personnel in Somalia in 1993 , Bosnia in 1994 , Kosovo in 1999 , Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq since 2003 have been issued M249s . Surplus weapons were donated to Bolivia , Colombia and Tunisia . 
 Tactically , SAWs are either carried with a maneuvering unit and fired while handheld , or positioned to remain stationary and provide covering fire for other units . The usual load of ammunition carried for the weapon is 1 @,@ 000 @-@ rounds in five 200 @-@ round belts , although up to 500 extra rounds generally get loaded into 100 @-@ round soft pouches .

 A supply of 929 M249 SAWs was issued to personnel from the U.S. Army and USMC during the Persian Gulf War . Although exposure to combat was scarce , M249 gunners who were involved in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions , rather than maneuvering with them . There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment . 
 = = = Afghanistan = = = 
 The standard squad automatic weapon in Afghanistan is the M249 with PIP kit , which serves alongside its heavier counterpart , the M240 machine gun . Most M249s were given a collapsible buttstock immediately prior to the invasion to reduce its length and make the weapons more practical for parachuting and close @-@ quarters combat . Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version of the weapon , which weighs much less . 
 A report entitled Lessons Learned in Afghanistan was released by Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Dean and SFC Sam Newland of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center in 2002 . They found that 54 % of SAW gunners had problems maintaining their weapons , and 30 % reported that the gun rusted easily . Soldiers reported ammunition boxes rattling and falling off . 80 % percent of soldiers surveyed were pleased with the weapon 's accuracy and lethality , yet only 64 % claimed they were " confident in their weapon " . Weapons clogging up with sand in the desert seems to be the main complaint . 
 = = = Iraq War = = = 
 The PIP and Para versions of the M249 have been used in the Iraq war since the invasion . By 2004 , many M249s had been in service for almost 20 years and were becoming increasingly unreliable . Soldiers were requesting replacements and new features , and there are reports of soldiers holding their weapons together with duct tape . The lethality of the 5 @.@ 56 mm ammunition has been called into question by reports of enemy soldiers still firing after being hit multiple times . As in previous conflicts , the sandy environment causes the M249s and other weapons to clog up and jam if they are not cleaned very regularly . 
 Operation Iraqi Freedom <unk> Soldier Lessons Learned , a report on the performance of weapons in the Iraq War , was published by Lieutenant Colonel Jim Smith of the U.S. Army on May 15 , 2003 . Smith spoke positively of the M249 , claiming that it " provided the requisite firepower at the squad level as intended " . He praised the SPW variant , noting that its " short barrel and forward pistol grip allowed for very effective use of the SAW in urban terrain " . At the National Defense Industrial Association in 2007 , LTC Al Kelly of the 1st Battalion , 17th Infantry gave a presentation describing the M249 as having " good range , excellent reliability " and an " excellent tracer " . He said that a cloth pouch was preferred over the plastic box for holding linked ammunition , and that " knock @-@ down power is poor but is compensated by rate of fire " . 
 In December 2006 , the Center for Naval Analyses released a report on U.S. small arms in combat . The CNA conducted surveys on 2 @,@ 608 troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 12 months . Only troops who fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate . 341 troops were armed with M249 SAWs , making up 13 percent of the survey . 71 percent of M249 users ( 242 troops ) reported that they were satisfied with the weapon . 40 percent of users preferred feeding the SAW with the soft 100 @-@ round pouch , while 21 percent chose the soft and hard 200 @-@ round pouches each . 60 percent ( 205 troops ) were satisfied with handling qualities , such as <unk> , size , and weight - of those dissatisfied , just under half thought that it was too heavy . M249 users had the lowest levels of satisfaction with weapon maintainability at 70 percent ( 239 troops ) , most due to the difficulty in removing and receiving small components and poor corrosion resistance . The SAW had the highest levels of stoppages at 30 percent ( 102 troops ) , and 41 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had a large impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re @-@ engage their target . 65 percent ( 222 troops ) did not need their machine guns repaired while in theater . 65 percent ( 222 troops ) were confident in the M249 's reliability , defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction , and 64 percent ( 218 troops ) were confident in its durability , defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will not break or need repair . Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their own maintenance . 60 percent of M249 users offered recommendations for improvements . 17 percent of requests were for making the weapon lighter , and another 17 percent were for more durable belt links and drums , as well as other modifications , such as a collapsible stock . 
 = = Variants = = 
 M249 PIP 
 The product improvement program kit replaced the original steel tubular stock with a plastic stock based upon the shape of the heavier M240 machine gun . The change in stocks allowed for the addition of a hydraulic buffer system to reduce recoil . In addition , the dual gas port settings were reduced to only one ; variants with the product improvement kit can no longer fire at a higher cyclic speed . A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns , and the formerly fixed barrel changing handle was swapped for a folding unit . Certain parts were beveled or chamfered to prevent cutting soldiers ' hands and arms . Other changes involved the bipod , pistol grip , flash suppressor , and sights . Over the years , additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative . These include an improved bipod , 100 – and 200 – round fabric " soft pack " magazines ( to replace the original plastic ammunition boxes ) , and Picatinny rails for the feed tray cover and forearm so that optics and other accessories may be added . 
 M249 Paratrooper 
 The M249 Paratrooper , often called " Para " , is a compact version of the gun with a shorter barrel and sliding aluminum buttstock based on that of the Minimi Para , so @-@ called because of its intended use by airborne troops . It is much shorter and considerably lighter than the regular M249 at 893 mm ( 35 in ) long and 7 @.@ 1 kg ( 16 lb ) in weight . The Army 's Rapid Fielding Initiative is in the process of replacing the original collapsible buttstock with an adjustable model based loosely on the design of the M4 carbine buttstock . 
 M249 Special Purpose Weapon 
 This lightweight and shorter version of the M249 is designed to meet USSOCOM special operations forces requirements . The barrel changing handle , magazine insertion well , and vehicle mounting lug all have been removed to reduce weight . As a result , the SPW cannot be mounted in vehicles or use M16 magazines . Picatinny rails were added to the feed cover and forearm for the mounting of optics , lasers , vertical <unk> , and other M4 <unk> kit accessories . The SPW has a detachable bipod . The SPW 's lightweight barrel is longer than that of the Para model , giving it a total length of 908 mm ( 36 in ) and a weight of 5 @.@ 7 kg ( 13 lb ) . 
 Mk 46 Mod 0 
 This is a variant of the special purpose weapon adopted by USSOCOM . The program , which led to both the Mk 46 and Mk 48 , was headed by the US Naval Special Warfare Command ( <unk> ) . Like the SPW , the barrel changing handle , magazine insertion well , and vehicle mounting lugs have been removed to save weight . However , the Mk 46 retains the standard M249 plastic buttstock instead of the collapsible buttstock used on the SPW . The Picatinny rail forearm differs slightly from the SPW . The Mk 46 has the option of using the lighter SPW barrel or a thicker , fluted barrel of the same length . 
 Mk 48 
 This is a 7 @.@ 62 × 51mm NATO version of the Mk 46 , used by USSOCOM , when a heavier cartridge is required . It is officially classified as an <unk> ( Light Weight Machine Gun ) and was developed as a replacement for the Mk 43 Mod 0 / 1 . The M60 based machine guns are a great deal more portable than the heavier M240 based designs used elsewhere in the US military in the infantry medium machine gun role . However , the M60 based designs have a long history of insufficient reliability . Trials conducted through the mid @-@ 1990s led the US Army to replace its M60 with the <unk> <unk> . The <unk> , however , weighs in at ≈ 27 @.@ 5 lb and is about 49 " long with the standard barrel . <unk> was reluctant to give up the increased portability of the M60 ( ≈ 22 @.@ 5 lb , 37 @.@ 7 " OAL with the shortest " Assault Barrel " ) designs in spite of the M240 's increased reliability . A request was put in for a new machine gun in 2001 , and FN responded with a scaled @-@ up version of the M249 weighing in at ≈ 18 @.@ 5 lb with an OAL of ≈ 39 @.@ 5 " . The new design achieved much better reliability than the M60 @-@ based weapons while bettering its light weight and maintaining the same manual of arms as the already in @-@ use M249 . USSOCOM was slated to begin receiving deliveries of the new gun in August 2003 . 
 <unk> 
 This is a semiautomatic version manufactured for the civilian sport shooting market . Derived from the fully automatic military firearm , this version shares most of the major components of the military models with the exception of the firing mechanism and the addition of welded internal components to prevent conversion to a fully automatic mode . Notably , this version retains the ability to be belt fed , an uncommon feature in civilian firearms .

 An extensive maintenance program intended to extend the service lives of M249s has been carried out to refurbish rifles , especially units that suffered from wear due to heavy use . In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early @-@ models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first @-@ generation M249s . This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models and is no longer present on the current @-@ issue M249 , which has reinforced rails and full @-@ length welding rather than spot welding . 
 The U.S. Marine Corps tested the M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle , a lighter , magazine @-@ fed rifle to supplement and partially replace the M249 . With plans to buy up to 4 @,@ 100 <unk> to complement and partially replace its 10 @,@ 000 M249s ( of which 8 @,@ 000 will remain in service ) held at platoon level , it has acquired 450 of the Heckler & Koch HK416 – based weapons for testing . The U.S. Army does not plan to introduce the IAR . Colonel Robert Radcliffe of the U.S. Army Infantry Research and Development Center stated that an automatic rifle with a magazine would lower the effectiveness and firepower of a squad . While the Marine Corps has 13 @-@ man squads , the Army organizes its soldiers into squads of nine and needs considerably more firepower from the squad machine gunners to make up the difference . The U.S. Army does , however , want to replace aging M249s with newer weapons . They are currently working on replacing the M249 's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock . 
 = Ursa Minor = 
 Ursa Minor ( Latin : " Smaller She @-@ Bear " , contrasting with Ursa Major ) , also known as the Little Bear , is a constellation in the Northern Sky . Like the Great Bear , the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle , hence the North American name , Little Dipper : seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper . It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd @-@ century astronomer Ptolemy , and remains one of the 88 modern constellations . Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation , particularly by mariners , because of Polaris being the North Star . 
 Polaris , the brightest star in the constellation , is a yellow @-@ white supergiant and the brightest Cepheid variable star in the night sky , ranging from an apparent magnitude of 1 @.@ 97 to 2 @.@ 00 . Beta Ursae Minoris , also known as Kochab , is an aging star that has swollen and cooled to become an orange giant with an apparent magnitude of 2 @.@ 08 , only slightly fainter than Polaris . Kochab and magnitude 3 Gamma Ursae Minoris have been called the " guardians of the pole star " . Planets have been detected orbiting four of the stars , including Kochab . The constellation also contains an isolated neutron star — <unk> — and <unk> + 65 , the hottest white dwarf yet discovered , with a surface temperature of 200 @,@ 000 K. 
 = = History and mythology = = 
 In the Babylonian star catalogues , Ursa Minor was known as <unk> , the Wagon of Heaven , <unk> . It appeared on a pair of tablets containing canonical star lists that were compiled around 1000 BC , the MUL.APIN , and was one of the " Stars of Enlil " — that is , the northern sky . The possible origin of its name was its appearing to rotate like a wheel around the north celestial pole . 
 The first mention of Ursa Minor in Greek texts was by philosopher Thales of Miletus in the 6th century BC . He pointed out that it was a more accurate guide to finding true north than Ursa Major . This knowledge had reportedly come from the Phoenicians in the eastern Mediterranean , and the constellation bore the term <unk> . Homer had previously only referred to one " bear " , raising the question of what he saw the stars of Ursa Minor as , or whether they were recognized as a constellation at all . 
 Ursa Minor and Ursa Major were related by the Greeks to the myth of Callisto and her son Arcas , both placed in the sky by Zeus . In a variant of the story in which Boötes represents Arcas , Ursa Minor represents a dog . This is the older tradition , which explains both the length of the tail and the obsolete alternate name of <unk> ( the dog 's tail ) for Polaris , the North Star . <unk> is also described as a nurse of Zeus , honoured by the god with a place in the sky . An alternate myth tells of two bears that saved Zeus from his murderous father Kronos by hiding him on Mount Ida . Later Zeus set them in the sky , but their tails grew long from being swung by the god . Because Ursa Minor consists of seven stars , the Latin word for " North " ( i.e. , where Polaris points ) is <unk> , from <unk> ( seven ) and <unk> ( oxen ) , from seven oxen driving a plough , which the seven stars also resemble . This name has also been attached to the main stars of Ursa Major . 
 Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation , particularly by mariners , because of Polaris being the North Star . Polaris is currently less than one degree away from the north celestial pole ( hence the alternative name Pole Star ) so its position in the sky is largely unaffected by the rotation of the Earth . From any point in the Northern Hemisphere the direction to Polaris is always north and its angular altitude is roughly equal to the latitude . 
 In Inuit astronomy , the three brightest stars — Polaris , Kochab and Pherkad — were known as <unk> " never moving " , though the term is more frequently used in the singular to refer to Polaris alone . The Pole Star is too high in the sky at far northern latitudes to be of use in navigation .

 Ursa Minor is bordered by Camelopardalis to the west , Draco to the west , and Cepheus to the east . Covering 256 square degrees , it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size . Ursa Minor is colloquially known in the US as the Little Dipper because its seven brightest stars seem to form the shape of a dipper ( ladle or scoop ) . The star at the end of the dipper handle is Polaris . Polaris can also be found by following a line through the two stars — Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris — that form the end of the ' bowl ' of the Big Dipper , for 30 degrees ( three upright fists at arms ' length ) across the night sky . The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little Dipper are of second , third , fourth , and fifth magnitudes , and provide an easy guide to determining what magnitude stars are visible , useful for city dwellers or testing one 's eyesight . 
 The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the IAU ( International Astronomical Union ) in 1922 , is " <unk> " . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a polygon of 22 segments ( illustrated in infobox ) . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between <unk> <unk> and 22h <unk> , while the declination coordinates range from the north celestial pole south to 65 @.@ 40 ° . Its position in the far northern celestial hemisphere means that the whole constellation is only visible to observers in the northern hemisphere .

 The German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters alpha to theta to label the most prominent stars in the constellation , while his countryman Johann Elert Bode subsequently added iota to phi . Only lambda and pi remain in use , likely because of their proximity to the north celestial pole . Within the constellation 's borders , there are 39 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6 @.@ 5 . 
 Marking the Little Bear 's tail , Polaris , or Alpha Ursae Minoris , is the brightest star in the constellation , varying between apparent magnitude 1 @.@ 97 and 2 @.@ 00 over a period of 3 @.@ 97 days .

 Located close to Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris , a red giant of spectral type M1III . It is a semiregular variable varying from magnitudes 6 @.@ 35 to 6 @.@ 45 . The northerly nature of the constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year : the red giant R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8 @.@ 5 to 11 @.@ 5 over 328 days , while S Ursae Minoris is a long period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8 @.@ 0 and 11 over 331 days .

T Ursae Minoris is another red giant variable star that has undergone a dramatic change in status — from being a long period ( Mira ) variable ranging from magnitude 7 @.@ 8 to 15 over 310 – 315 days to a semiregular variable . The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash — a point where the shell of helium around the star 's core reaches a critical mass and ignites — marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979 . Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6 magnitudes in 1992 and was identified as one of a rare class of stars — R Coronae Borealis variables . 
 Eclipsing variables are star systems that vary in brightness because of one star passing in front of the other rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity .

 = Japanese settlement in Palau = 
 There is a small Japanese community in Palau , which mainly consists of Japanese expatriates residing in Palau over a long @-@ term basis . A few Japanese expatriates started to reside in Palau after it gained independence in 1994 , and established long @-@ term businesses in the country . Japanese settlement in Palau dates back to the early 19th century , although large scale Japanese migration to Palau did not occur until the 1920s , when Palau came under Japanese rule and administered as part of the South Pacific Mandate . Japanese settlers took on leading administrative roles in the Japanese colonial government , and developed Palau 's economy . After the Japanese surrender in 1945 , virtually all of the Japanese population was repatriated back to Japan , although people of mixed Japanese @-@ Palauan descent were allowed to remain behind . People of Japanese @-@ Palauan descent constitute a large minority of Palau 's population as a result of substantial <unk> between the Japanese settlers and Palauans . They generally identify with , conforming to cultural norms and daily lives with the Palauans . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early years ( 1820 – 1945 ) = = = 
 The first recorded account of Japanese contact in Palau occurred in 1820 , when a coastal sailing ship was blown off course and eight surviving men spent five years in Palau until 1825 . Japanese traders began to establish settlements from the mid @-@ 19th century onwards , and by 1890 two Japanese trading stations had been established . Many of these traders married the daughters of local chieftains and raised local families . When Japan annexed Palau from Germany in 1914 , Japanese settlers and their descendants acted as state liaison officials and interpreters for the Japanese military administration . 
 A civilian government was established in 1922 with its headquarters at Koror , replacing the military administration . The civilian government initiated a programme to identify and <unk> unused land between 1923 and 1932 for redevelopment . Much of these land were used to build new industrial estates and expand towns to accommodate immigrants from Japan and Okinawa . In Japan , the government actively encouraged the Japanese and Okinawans to resettle in Micronesia , including Palau , and began establishing farming settlements . The first farming settlement was established at <unk> in 1926 , but the settlers encountered problems with its humid tropical environment and abandoned it by 1930 , although later settlements were established more successfully . 
 As the Great Depression resulted in massive unemployment in the late 1920s and 1930s , more Japanese and Okinawans migrated to Palau . Immigrants brought along their families and sought employment in various professions . The Japanese immigrants held administrative posts , while the Okinawans and a few Koreans worked as labourers in the agricultural , fishery and mining industries . By 1935 , the Japanese constituted at least 60 % of Palau 's population and were concentrated in urban areas such as Angaur and Koror . Some Japanese settlers took Palauan wives or mistresses , and there was a sizeable minority of mixed Japanese @-@ Palauan children towards the later years of the Japanese administration . 
 The Japanese navy expanded their military facilities from 1937 onwards . More labourers from Japan and Korea were employed to construct the facilities to complete the facilities within a short period of time . The number of indentured labourers rose to more than 10 @,@ 000 throughout Micronesia , and placed a heavy strain on the islands ' scarce resources . Many Okinawan and Japanese labourers and permanent settlers were <unk> back to their homeland . Japanese men were conscripted into regular services , and Palauans who held administrative posts in the police force were reallocated jobs in the agricultural sector . The Japanese civilians played an important role in the islands ' propaganda activities . As food resources were cut off from Japan , many Japanese encountered greater difficulties in dealing with starvation than their Palauan counterparts , who were more knowledgeable with tropical survival skills . 
 = = = Recent years ( 1945 – present ) = = = 
 Following the Surrender of Japan to the Allied forces , Japanese military personnel and civilians were repatriated to Japan between 1945 and 1946 , although some 350 labourers and technicians were permitted to remain behind to carry out repair works to Palau 's infrastructure . However , offspring of Japanese @-@ Palauan intermarriages were allowed to remain , although a few migrated to Japan with their fathers . In the 1950s , Japanese @-@ Palauans formed an organisation , Sakura @-@ kai to assist Japanese @-@ Palauans and Japanese youths who were abandoned by their parents to search for their parents and kinsmen who were forcibly separated as a result of forced repatriation of Japanese settlers back to Japan . The organisation became a cultural organisation from the 1980s onwards , as most Japanese @-@ Palauans had reunited with their Japanese families or voluntarily chose to leave certain family separations as they were . 
 Palau 's interaction with Japan was kept to a minimal level during the post @-@ war years , although Okinawan fishermen occasionally visited Palau for catches from the 1960s onwards . A few Japanese nationals resettled in Palau in the 1970s , and married local Palauans . In the 1980s , Japanese businessmen set up businesses in Palau , and by 1995 there were 218 Japanese nationals residing in Palau . Of these , about half of them expressed a desire for permanent residency in Palau and a few married Palauan or Filipino women . However , the majority brought their families from Japan along , and maintained frequent contacts with Japan . Some settlers from the 1980s also consisted of former Japanese settlers who were repatriated back to Japan after World War II . Former settlers who returned to Palau usually consisted of individuals over 60 years of age , and often worked as tour guides or restaurateurs in Palau . 
 Many Japanese @-@ Palauans assumed key positions in the public service sector and politics . At least one ethnologist , Mark Peattie , suggested that the strong representation of Japanese @-@ Palauans in leading positions in society could be attributed to the mainstream Japanese education which they had received in their youth . Palau 's first president , <unk> Nakamura — who was half @-@ Japanese — fostered closer diplomatic ties between Japan and Palau during his Presidency . During a state visit to Japan in 1996 , Emperor Akihito personally received Nakamura , and the visit was commended by Palauans and Japanese alike . Nakamura 's visit prompted Japan to channel monetary aid to Palau to facilitate repair work on the Koror @-@ Babeldaob Bridge and securing special trade agreements with Japan . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 In the early years of civilian administration , the Japanese population consisted of about a few hundred individuals , and reached a little over 2 @,@ 000 by 1930 . The Japanese resident population increased at an exponential rate from the mid @-@ 1930s onwards , and there were about 15 @,@ 000 Japanese in Palau by 1938 , the vast majority of whom were concentrated in Koror . The influx of Japanese immigrants fuelled the development of Koror into a city by 1939 . The Palauans were quickly outnumbered by the Japanese , and constituted only about 16 percent of the city 's population in 1937 . The Japanese made up more than half of the islands ' population , as well as 27 % of Micronesia 's Japanese population in a 1938 census . A large minority of the Japanese populace consisted of Okinawan immigrants , as well as a few Koreans . Palau 's Japanese population was repatriated after the Japanese surrender , but people of Japanese @-@ Palauan descent remained behind and constitute a large minority of Palau 's population . A study done by the <unk> Pacific Island Nations Fund estimated that about 10 % of Palauans are born to a Japanese father and Palauan mother , the vast majority of whom were born before 1945 . Another study done by the Foundation for Advanced Studies in International Development from Japan in 2005 estimates that about 25 % of Palau 's populace have some Japanese ancestry . 
 The following table shows the increase in the Japanese population in Palau throughout the Japanese colonial era : 
 = = Language = = 
 During the Japanese colonial era , Japanese settlers mainly used Japanese in their daily discourse , and Japanese was the lingua franca used for communication between Japanese and Palauans . English was also recognised as a co @-@ official language along with Japanese , and many Japanese had at least some knowledge of the language as well . People of mixed Japanese @-@ Palauan heritage were more competent in Japanese than to Palauan , especially those who attended mainstream primary schools . The Japanese also introduced the use of the Katakana script in Palauan , which was also used in informal settings . After the Japanese surrender , the use of Japanese was discouraged in place of Palauan and English . Most Japanese @-@ Palauans use Palauan in their daily discourse in favour of Japanese or English , although Japanese was used more frequently among Japanese @-@ Palauans than to those that do not have Japanese ancestry . As the number of Japanese tourists increased during the 1990s , Japanese was introduced as an elective subject to Palauan schools and in elections . 
 = = Religion = = 
 State Shinto was heavily emphasised in the 1930s as a means to promote Japanese nationalism and <unk> of Palauans to Japanese norms . A few shrines were built around Palau during the 1930s . Of particular note was the completion of the <unk> Nanyo Jinja ( <unk> the Great Southern Shrine ) in November 1940 at Koror , which subsequently served as the central shrine in Micronesia . Civilian participation of Shinto rituals was heavily emphasised , which focused on Japanese cultural ideals and worship of the Japanese emperor . Shinto , Zen Buddhist and Tenrikyo missions were also encouraged to establish religious missions , and the first Buddhist temple in Palau was erected in 1926 , mainly to cater to the spiritual needs of the Japanese settlers . Early Japanese settlers reportedly built small Shinto shrines in agricultural colonies before the civilian government actively encouraged religious missionary activities in Palau . 
 Christian missions were initially given financial support by the Japanese civilian government and were encouraged to stamp out certain <unk> rituals practiced by Palauans , but many were later imprisoned from the late 1930s onwards as the Japanese became suspicious of the missionaries ' involvement in espionage activities . After the war , many of these shrines were abandoned or demolished , and Japanese @-@ Palauans chose to adopt Christianity in favour of Buddhism or Shinto . In the 1980s and 1990s , miniature replicas of the Great Shinto Shrine , Peleliu and Angaur shrines were reconstructed . Unlike Shinto shrines during the Japanese colonial era , reconstructed shrines served as memorial sites for Japanese soldiers who in battles died during the Second World War , and are visited by Japanese tourists and family members of slain soldiers . 
 = = Society = = 
 = = = Racial segregation = = = 
 The Japanese civilian administration segregated the Japanese immigrants from the Palauans and adopted policies that were intended to protect the welfare of the Palauans . From the 1930s onwards , focus was later shifted towards providing more for the Japanese immigrants as the civilian administration faced difficulties in meeting the demands of an increasing immigrant population . Racial segregation was practiced in most sectors of society , but was more highly pronounced in the workforce and educational sectors . Palauans faced difficulties in getting employed in administrative positions in the workforce , which was dominated by Japanese settlers . In the educational sector , Japanese children attended mainstream primary schools ( <unk> ) whose lessons are based on the mainstream curriculum as with other schools on mainland Japan . Palauan children attended " public schools " ( <unk> ) and attended lessons that focused on imparting skills for menial labour . Most students from " Public schools " dropped out after completing their elementary education and some children of Japanese fathers and Palauan mothers also faced difficulties in getting enrolled into primary schools , especially for those who were born out of wedlock . 
 = = = Mixed @-@ race descendants = = = 
 During the Japanese colonial @-@ era , a sizeable minority of mixed @-@ race Japanese @-@ Palauans emerged . Japanese @-@ Palauans were offsprings of intermarriages between Japanese men and Palauan women . Most of them lived in urban areas , and were brought up in accordance to Japanese norms and values and spoke Japanese in their daily lives . A few sought further education in Japan , and at the same time had limited knowledge of Palauan customs and language , although children that were born out of wedlock reportedly had a greater exposure to their matrilineal customs and spoke both Japanese and Palauan fluently . Although Japanese @-@ Palauan children were generally classified as Japanese in official figures and had access to Japanese social privileges , many reportedly faced discrimination when placed in Japanese and Palauan circles . In rural areas where Palauans formed higher concentrations , spouses and mistresses of Japanese men were shunned upon , and Palauan nationalists ( especially <unk> ) actively discouraged mixed unions between Japanese men and Palauan women . The Japanese government encouraged such intermarriages , and provided social benefits to women who had married Japanese men . However , only unions with civilian men were recognised and military personnel were prohibited from marrying Palauan women , although they were allowed to keep mistresses . The civilian government suppressed unions between Palauan men and Japanese women , and there was only one known case of a union between a Palauan man and a Japanese woman during the Japanese colonial @-@ era . 
 After the Japanese surrender in 1945 , Japanese settlers were repatriated back to Japan , and male Japanese settlers who had raised Japanese @-@ Palauan families abandoned their families in favour of repatriation , reasoning that the offspring would be able to better adapt in Palau than in Japan . Many of these Palauan women raised their mixed @-@ race children singlehandedly , while others were abandoned and adopted by Palauan families . Some Japanese @-@ Palauan families migrated to Japan , but generally faced a cultural shock and petitioned to return to Palau after living in Japan for some years . Most petitions were allowed , although they were not allowed to bring their Japanese spouses along . 
 Second and third @-@ generation descendants of Japanese @-@ Palauans who were descended from earlier settlers generally chose to remain behind , although those who were raised in Japanese @-@ speaking families reportedly faced trouble conversing in Palauan . Most retained their Japanese surnames , but Japanese @-@ <unk> generally identified themselves as Palauans after the war . Second @-@ generation Japanese @-@ Palauans usually married Palauan women , and became assimilated with the local Palauan populace . In terms of self @-@ identification , Japanese @-@ Palauans usually emphasised their Japanese identities only on occasions when they associate with other Japanese , for instance when they participate in memorial services for Japanese soldiers who died during the Pacific War . Some Japanese @-@ Palauans also chose to be buried in Japanese cemeteries after their deaths , notably those in Koror . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The Japanese civilian administration encouraged Japanese businessmen and settlers to the expand phosphate mining and copra production , which came into commercial existence during the German colonial era . During this time , new infrastructure was built between towns — including road and harbour facilities , and electricity and sewerage lines were laid out . Immigration from Japan , Okinawa and Korea to Palau intensified as a result of new job opportunities . A state @-@ owned enterprise , Nanyo <unk> Kabushiki Kaisha ( South Seas Colonization Corporation ) was formed in 1936 to streamline the islands ' economic activities with the administration objective of developing the islands ' self @-@ sufficiency capabilities . In the late 1930s , Japanese pearl divers made regular visits to the Arafura Sea , and stopped by Palau from October to April . The influx of pearl divers from Japan led to the development of the island 's tourist industry , and some Japanese settlers from Saipan opened new cafés , geisha houses and liquor houses in Koror to cater to the pearl divers during their stopovers in between October to April . 
 When the Japanese surrendered in 1945 , Japanese business enterprises and organisations in Palau closed , effectively ending the Japanese influence on Palau 's economy . In the first two decades after the war , the American occupation government imposed strict trade restrictions with Japan . Contact with Japan was reestablished in the 1960s , starting with Okinawan fishermen who were granted fishing rights . Japanese tourists began to visit Palau in increasing numbers from the mid @-@ 1970s . The growing influx of tourists to Palau led to the restoration of heritage sites around Palau , particularly memorial sites and administrative buildings built in the Japanese era as well as Palauan longhouses to accommodate to the interests of Japanese tourists , which accounted for half of all visiting tourists . Many of Palau 's tourist sites were run and maintained by Palauan citizens of Japanese @-@ Palauan heritage , whose knowledge in Japanese and Palauan customs and languages helped to facilitate tour groups consisting of Japanese tourists .

 = Tropical Storm Zeta = 
 Tropical Storm Zeta was a late @-@ developing tropical storm over the central Atlantic that formed after the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season had officially ended ( on November 30 ) and continued into January 2006 . Becoming a tropical depression at approximately midnight on December 30 ( UTC ) , it became the record @-@ breaking thirtieth tropical cyclone of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and after intensifying into Tropical Storm Zeta six hours later , it became the season 's twenty @-@ seventh named storm . Zeta was one of only two Atlantic tropical cyclones to span two calendar years ( the other being Hurricane Alice in 1954 – 55 ) . 
 Zeta originated from an area of low pressure on December 29 , which previously developed within an upper @-@ level trough . After becoming a tropical storm , the National Hurricane Center continually predicted it would weaken rapidly . Like the previous tropical cyclone , Hurricane Epsilon , Zeta defied these predictions . The storm reached its peak strength on January 2 , 2006 before finally dissipating on January 6 . As Zeta never approached land there was no impact from the storm other than minor shipping problems . Several ships encountered the storm , and several crews in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race were affected by rough seas and high winds . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Tropical Storm Zeta originated from an upper @-@ level trough that interacted with a weakening frontal system in late @-@ December 2005 . By December 28 , the trough had developed into a low pressure area roughly 750 mi ( 1 @,@ 210 km ) west @-@ northwest of the Cape Verde Islands . The following day , a low @-@ level circulation developed and convective activity began to increase around the low . By December 30 , sufficient shower and thunderstorm activity had developed for the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) to classify it as a tropical cyclone . Over the following several hours , convective banding developed around the storm 's center and by 0600 UTC , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Zeta , the record 28th tropical or subtropical cyclone to form during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season . Operationally , however , the NHC did not begin issuing advisories on Zeta until 1700 UTC . Traveling slowly northwestward in response to a mid @-@ level low to the southwest , the storm gradually intensified in a region of favorable anticyclonic outflow . 
 By the afternoon of December 30 , dry air caused the system to become slightly disorganized and led forecasters to anticipate further weakening of the storm and dissipating within three days . The following day , a mid @-@ level ridge to the north caused Zeta turn westward before nearly stalling due to upper @-@ level westerlies . By this time , the storm attained winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) but increasing wind shear caused convection to become disorganized , resulting in a brief weakening period . Despite the shear , the shallow structure of Zeta allowed convection to regenerate and the storm gradually re @-@ intensified . Around 1800 UTC on January 1 , 2006 , Zeta attained its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 994 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 35 inHg ) roughly 1 @,@ 035 mi ( 1 @,@ 665 km ) northwest of the Cape Verde Islands . By January 2 , the storm began tracking towards the southwest in response to a mid @-@ level trough located east of the storm . Tropical Storm Zeta continued to defy forecasts of weakening . 
 The effects of wind shear finally took their toll late on January 4 , and Zeta 's convection began to die down . This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm . The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression , which was later confirmed to have been an error . Zeta continued to move west @-@ northwestward , barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again . Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and dissipated into a remnant later that day . With this transition , the very active 2005 hurricane season finally came to a close . The remnant low retained its identity for a further day before it dissipated 660 miles ( 1060 km ) southeast of Bermuda . 
 = = Impact and records = = 
 Several of the crews that were taking part in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race were affected with heavy seas and strong adverse winds from Tropical Storm Zeta . Several teams encountered winds up to 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) and large swells up to 12 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . Although battered by torrential rain and high winds , the direction of the winds assisted some of the ships in the race by speeding them closer to Antigua . One Welsh vessel was blown 25 mi ( 40 km ) off @-@ course , ending with an encounter with a 12 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) shark that battered their boat . The ship Liberty Star made several reports of strong winds from Tropical Storm Zeta , including one of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) winds early on December 31 , when the ship was about 45 miles ( 75 km ) north of the storm . 
 When Zeta formed at 0600 UTC on December 30 , it became the second latest @-@ forming tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic . Only Hurricane Alice of December 1954 formed later than Zeta , becoming a tropical storm around 1200 UTC . Additionally , Zeta became the second known Atlantic tropical cyclone , along with Alice , to exist in two calendar years . Tropical Storm Zeta also extended the record number of storms to form in the 2005 season to twenty @-@ eight , seven more than the previous record held by the 1933 season . 
 Although the storm affected several vessels during its existence , no land areas were threatened by Zeta . As a result , the NHC did not issue any tropical storm watches or warnings .

 = = = Creation and casting = = = 
 The intent for Connor 's character was to put " Angel in an emotional space . " He was meant to give Angel more to live for than just the usual " day to day " living he was experiencing . " Plus , I just love the idea of this embarrassing effect of a one @-@ night stand , ” Joss Whedon explained in his decision to introduce Angel ’ s son . The character was given the Irish name Connor , meaning ‘ counselor ’ or ' helping warrior ' , to match Angel 's Irish ancestry . Three different babies , triplets Connor , Jake , and Trenton <unk> , were chosen to portray Connor so that none of them had to remain on the set for very long . Baby Connor was a main focus of season three , but the creators were well aware of the limitations of a baby character . With Connor ’ s initial role in plot decided , they came up with the concept of a ' teenage ' version for further appearances . 
 Vincent Kartheiser , then 23 , was looking for something more stable than the usual feature movies . He decided to audition after his agent sent him the role and tapes of all previous seasons . The producers wanted the character to be a surprise to audiences , so not even Kartheiser was informed that he was trying out for Angel 's son . Instead he auditioned for a character created for the purpose of audition , ‘ the Street Kid ’ , a normal teenager who had Angel as his guardian . " Right away everyone kind of had a good feeling about me joining the cast , " Vincent says . " It seemed that I just fit right in . " Kartheiser was excited after learning that his real role was ' Angel 's son , a demon killer from Quor 'toth . ’ He was confused about his portrayal , thinking that the character was to have a " living @-@ in @-@ the @-@ brush kind of ‘ failed being ’ attitude . " Instead , he was told to just " stand up straight , [ use a ] normal voice , " and let a regular boy come on . Vincent Kartheiser was initially contracted for three episodes with an option to pick him up further . 
 = = = Characterization = = = 
 Teenage Connor is an angry , brooding , intense , and volatile teenager who is vindictive towards Angel . Vincent Kartheiser described him as withdrawn and " not willing to open up to the group happiness everyone is so inclined to be part of " . He also highlighted his ' alienation ' of this world and resulting caution and unwillingness to trust others . Tim Minear further characterizes Connor by his strong need for family which " means everything to this kid because he 's never had one " and put emphasis on his " conflicted " personality triggered by his upbringing . David Fury and Minear also highlight Connor 's similarity to Angel . Fury worked on the resemblance of strength , fighting style , and personality . Minear compared their trait of accepting responsibility even in the worst times . Intending to show Connor as a formidable fighter , Kelly A. Manners described him as " quite the hunter , quite the killer . " Kartheiser notes him as " truly badass " , and jokingly compares his fighting style to that of ' Jackie Chan ' , He is attracted to women older than him , which becomes a running gag in the series . 
 Connor , despite being the son of two " vampires , " is meant to be " human " with otherwise super powers . Due to this , he wasn ’ t given the vampire makeup of the series . Kartheiser expresses his simultaneous joy and dismay at this , considering makeup an added benefit for the character and agreeing that the lack of it saved him much time . Connor was initially clad in clothes made of animal skin , and his attire was said to resemble ' Peter Pan ' and ' Robin Hood ' . He was also wearing , as a trophy , a necklace made of parts of demons he killed in hell . After he settles in this world , he drops the necklace and is given a more casual set of clothes : jeans , t @-@ shirts , and jackets . The concept behind Connor ’ s wardrobe was that , unconcerned with this world ’ s fashion sense , he " just took whatever was available . " Yet , one interviewer notices his clothing to be " conservative [ .. ] for somebody who 's never seen an advert " . Connor 's hairstyle at the start was short and choppy as if cut with a knife . Afterward he 's given a modern and cleaner look with longer , styled hair . Kartheiser was critical of the new hair style calling it ' David Cassidy hair @-@ do ' and feeling it was a ' little bit heavy ' . 
 Connor undergoes dramatic changes in season five . Very much an opposite to his earlier persona , the only features common with his previous self are his protectiveness of loved ones , attraction to older women , and later his fighting prowess . Otherwise he 's a prosperous , sweet young man , due to his fake memories of a happy childhood . Jeffrey Bell wanted to highlight Connor 's " well @-@ adjusted " mentality for this season . Vincent calls him a " happy " person and liked playing this version more because he has been playing the " brooding " version for a year and a half year . The comic book Connor develops in the same direction as he starts emerging a hero still keeping his pleasant personality . Joss Whedon characterizes the comic book Connor as " the closest thing to a superhero hell has ' because he has powers without any of the weaknesses of the vampire , and is well adjusted . Brain considers him " one of the coolest characters in any series or comics " .

 Characteristic to Joss Whedon 's characters , Connor goes through drastic changes with the series progression . Introduced as an ' impossible birth ' at the start of season three , as an infant the character still had little chance of his own development . So he became an agent for evolution of others ; Darla through him , redeems herself of her villainous acts spanning two television series , and Wesley transform from a goofy sidekick to a brooding anti @-@ hero . Once these developments came to fruition , the creators chose to upgrade Connor to a teen . Taking advantage of the fantasy genre , they were able to accelerate his growth within a few weeks of the show 's normal timeline , thus not affecting the ages of the rest of the characters and setting up stage for the next act . The middle of season three sees the infant kidnapped by Angel 's long @-@ term adversary Holtz , who takes Connor to a hell dimension where " time moves differently , " explains David Greenwalt . " We didn 't want to raise a baby for 18 years . " 
 Connor returns near the end of the season as a feral teenage warrior who is vindictive towards Angel . Connor 's age at his return is disputed : both the creators and episodes vary between putting him at 16 and 18 . Regarding Connor 's upbringing , Mere Smith elaborates that " Holtz has brought up Connor to hate his father , his father is the devil as far as Holtz is concerned and he tells Connor that " This development allowed the writers to explore a unique ' foil ' to protagonists because Connor was established to be " deep down " much like Angel himself . Minear goes on to explain with Smith that immediately following Connor 's return from hell , Angel had started " converting the boy to his side , " showing him that he 's no longer a bad guy . Just when Connor is bonding with Angel , Holtz kills himself upon sensing the danger of their reconciliation . This makes Connor back track and sets off a back and forth pattern that continues to repeat till the end of season four with Cordelia and then Jasmine taking Holtz ' position between father and son . 
 Much of Connor 's development in season three and four is his continuous shifting alliances between protagonists and antagonists ; he is unable to find his place or his purpose for being . Jeffrey Bell says that all the confusing and conflicting circumstances never allow Connor a break , which he thinks " makes him empathetic in midst of making all wrong choices " . Steven S. DeKnight says : 
 We really wanted to highlight [ .. ] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance . He never had a childhood , he 's been lied to and manipulated and in this episode we find out his whole reason for being was to bring this other thing into this world , so he 's been played his entire life . You really root for him to make the right decision in this one , but you know tragic figure he doesn 't . 
 Season four also sees the writers exploring teenage sexuality through him , in a small arc with Faith , with whom Steven S. DeKnight compares him in their characterization of misguided youth with superpowers ; and the overarching arc with his father 's love Cordelia . Jeffrey Bell states Arthurian Legend 's animosity between King Arthur , his son Mordred , and their love triangle with Guinevere as inspiration for the Connor @-@ Cordelia @-@ Angel plot line . Whedon notes that while he already has decided that Cordelia and Connor were going to have sex , the story had to be changed and move faster because Charisma Carpenter became pregnant . The Cordelia plot line additionally gave writers opportunity to explain Connor 's birth via Jasmine , a character brought in to replace Carpenter as final villain . Taking Jasmine as a base point the writers started connecting back the dots they 'd set up in previous seasons . In the words of DeKnight , " It 's always been the big mystery of how and why Darla and Angel have a child , ' cause vampires are sterile . We find out this miracle birth was created kind of like a secret ingredient all planned out to sleep with Cordelia and create this <unk> . " 
 Regarding the resolution of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast , Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season , and " it was time to end the character 's story " . But , they changed his original " violent , morbid " sendoff to a relatively happy one , citing their likability of actor and character as the reason . Also it was " nice to give someone a happy ending for once . " Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff , particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted : 
 That to me is the soul of the character . The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him . For Connor , everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz , and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out , I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity . He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz . 
 The last scene of Angel watching memory @-@ wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon 's idea , derived from 1937 's classic movie Stella Dallas : 
 " I 've given up my child . I see my child is happy , and does not know me , and I 'm happy . That is the thing that made Stella <unk> the greatest , the thing that made this episode work . " 
 Despite Whedon 's claim that the fourth season is a ‘ final statement ' for Connor , the character returns for a couple guests appearances in the fifth . This season sees a big development with a " well @-@ adjusted " Connor and the long @-@ due reconciliation of father and son ; Connor is able to accept and appreciate all Angel did for him after his memories return . Minear and Bell were open to and had mentioned the possibility of character 's return to Kartheiser at the end of season four . But following his return , Kartheiser isn 't sure if the re @-@ appearance was not only due to the necessity of tying up loose ends after the series was reckoned to be canceled . Originally Kartheiser was asked to appear for one episode " Origin " but the crew and Kartheiser enjoyed working with revamped Connor so much that " it became clear to [ them ] that he had to appear for the series finale " . 
 Connor again returns for Angel : After the Fall . Brian Lynch was initially confused about how to incorporate Connor into the story . It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series . He said , " Connor 's a young kid , he 's got powers , he doesn 't have any of the bad things , he 's not a vampire , so maybe he would enjoy it , and maybe he would be the closest thing to a superhero hell has " . Well @-@ adjusted now , Connor is shown " fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero " for the comic series . Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline , but with time it became clear to him that Connor 's story is more about his relationship with Angel . So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor @-@ Angel went on to become a much closer father @-@ son unit . Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most . Regarding Connor 's upcoming role in Angel & Faith , Whedon joked about time @-@ traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive , referencing Kartheiser ' s recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men . Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor 's appearance with " otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad ! " 
 In the Angel & Faith Comics , Connor returns in the " Family Reunion " arc , beginning with Issue # 11 . Willow telling Angel that she needs Connor to act as a compass to Quor 'toth , the world he grew up in , to help restore magic to the world . Connor is now a college student studying social work with a girlfriend named Natalie he 's been dating 3 months . He rapidly agrees to help Willow and a very reluctant Angel . Connor has seen the toll on society , especially the disenfranchised , that has occurred since magic seed was destroyed in Buffy Season 8 . With a blood ritual using Connor 's blood , Willow tears a fabric in reality to Quor 'toth and Willow , Faith , Angel , and Connor head into the " darkest of the dark worlds " .

 = = = Reviews = = = 
 The show 's cast and crew repeatedly praised Vincent Kartheiser for his professionalism and ability to bring much to his character . " You can bet the family fortune on this kid , he can really do it , " stated director Vern <unk> . Producer Tim Minear described Vincent as one of the main reasons of their avoidance of giving the character a ghastly send @-@ off as planned before , “ We ’ ve all grown so fond of the character and the actor that we didn ’ t want do that . ” Although fans and critics reception to Kartheiser ’ s portrayal of the disturbed teen was also very positive , the character and his storylines turned out to be controversial . 
 His sexual relationship with his surrogate mother , Cordelia , particularly evoked attention . Most responses to this couple were negative . <unk> 's columnist Amy Berner declared them a " finalist in the Most Disturbing Couple In Television History “ . In her academic essay " The Assassination of Cordelia Chase , " Jennifer Crusie complained that this plot line led to the destruction of Cordelia 's character . Charisma Carpenter herself , despite previously noted to have fun portraying the role , became critical of the storyline over time , declaring her character ’ s seduction of a teenage boy creepy . Yet , a few gave a positive response . Liz <unk> of <unk> included the Angel – Cordelia – Connor triangle in the plus points of fourth season . <unk> praised the plot line as a " very King Arthur like tale of love and betrayal . " Another group was neutral towards the development . In his book Blood Relations : Chosen Families in Buffy and Angel , Jes Battis simply observed that the relationship completes the already present “ circuit of erotic incest within Buffy and Angel . ” Jean <unk> , in her academic essay " A World Without Love : The Failure of Family in Angel , " agreed with previous statements , further noting that Connor is the product of a relationship with incestuous tones : ” Angel is seduced by Darla , formerly his sire ( mother ) , now his granddaughter [ .. ] Connor ’ s life , unbeknownst to either parent , has begun . ” 
 Connor ’ s characterization and main storyline with his father in season three and four received mixed to positive reviews . Ben from <unk> was not fond of the initial episodes with baby Connor because Angel wasted time “ baby @-@ talking , ” but he loved the development with teenage Connor , “ The [ third ] season ends with a great storyline as Connor returns [ .. ] and betrays Angel . ” Jes Battis praised the father / son dynamics and described as “ highly dramatic and ( engagingly perverse ) ” . Journalist Sarah D. Bunting called Connor " a frustrating character " and wrote that while she " gets where he is coming from " and his ” twitchy , PTSD @-@ ish interactions ring true " , they become old too quick due to lack of real development of character and the relationship with Angel for most of season four . Kartheiser himself expressed this development concern , but he said that " Towards the end of the season I was really happy about the chances I was getting . " This last statement is echoed in Jamie Pool 's review , who called the “ ending ” to Connor " emotionally satisfying " , despite noting him to not have been particularly endearing through most of the remaining season . <unk> of <unk> , however , described Connor ’ s overall characterization " sharp " with " really intriguing sub @-@ textual material " and among the saving graces of the season . Strega of Television Without Pity , also praised the character 's psychology , " The thing I like most is that they 've not only created a teenager who doesn 't just feel like he 's the most alienated person in the world -- he actually is , " and " I love how unloved Connor [ thinks he ] is … ” Jean <unk> described the Darla @-@ Angel @-@ Connor @-@ Jasmine arc as " surely one of the most ambitious story arcs any television show has ever attempted “ Stacey Abbott of PopMatters called the Darla @-@ Angel @-@ Connor storyline " provocative " and " pure family melodrama " . <unk> 's Tara <unk> summed up : 
 " Vincent Kartheiser [ Connor ] had a challenging year playing Angel ’ s errant son , to say the least . While audiences may have hoped for a reconciliation between the two , it was never meant to be . Connor instead started and remained [ .. ] as petulant and unsympathetic as many teens are in real life . [ His pairing with ] Cordelia completely fouled just about everyone and made him the whipping boy for fan ire . But [ Vincent ] earns serious kudos for his amazing last inning transformation of Connor from brat to tragic figure worthy of pity and understanding in Peace Out and Home . That Vincent was able to redeem Connor in such a short time is a true feat in itself and it was singularly responsible for making the finale as heartbreaking and haunting as it ended up being . " 
 A revamped Connor received praise during the final season . Phoenix of <unk> declared Connor 's return as “ triumphant ” , saying this “ shy , sweet , happy young man ” is the kid Angel always wanted , and “ for the audience , a version of the character finally worth liking and supporting . ” Roz Kaveney , in his essay " A Sense of the Ending : Schrödinger 's Angel , " praised the new Connor as a “ heroic youth ” . Writer Brian Lynch admitted that he did not love season four 's Connor , but that he " really liked him " in season five " when he came back and he was well adjusted . " 
 Connor 's name is often mentioned with Buffy the Vampire Slayer 's Dawn Summers younger sister to Buffy Summers similarly created to give a strong emotional connection to the titular character . Four years after the cancellation of Angel , IGN included Connor along with Dawn in their list of classic TV 's cliché of ‘ Adding a Kid ’ as a last @-@ ditch effort to save a dying show . However they refused to comment if his addition was a good or bad choice in order to avoid swamping themselves from irate fans of either side . David Hofstede in his book What Were They Thinking ? openly criticized Connor and Dawn ’ s addition , appointing them number <unk> in his list of " 100 Dumbest Events in Television History " . 
 Connor 's appearance as a regular in After the Fall , was initially met with dismay by some fans . IDW representative Chris Ryall responded to these complaints with optimism , assuring the fans that the character would win them over , just the way he has been , by the time the series end . True to his words , After The Fall ’ s Connor was received positively . Brian Lynch confirmed this in an interview , stating that Connor has not only been the most pleasantly surprising character for him to write , he has been the most surprising for the fans as well , " Connor was a great character on the TV show but , I don ’ t think he was ever a favorite . But he ’ s slowly but surely become one of the most popular characters in After The Fall , which is wonderful . " He further said that he himself like the character so much now , he wants to do a book called ' Son of Angel ' based on him . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 Connor has been analyzed and compared with other male characters of the series in terms of the presentation and evolution of masculinity in fiction . His sexual relation with his surrogate mother , coupled with his struggles to kill his father , led to numerous speculations that mythical Greek figure Oedipus was the inspiration for the <unk> and references to Arthurian Legend were also made . In Erin B. Waggoner 's book Sexual rhetoric in the works of Joss Whedon , he found it interesting that the ancient Oedipus complex continues to be used as a way to underscore one 's masculinity , but he added that " Connor is not the only one [ .. ] Angel , Wes , Spike and even Fred ( through Gunn ) kill father or father figures in order to come into their own as individuals . " Further citing Gwen 's role among Connor and Gunn in the comic series triangle , he observed the unrelenting use of women as a device for men to shore up . 
 Stacey Abbott of PopMatters cited David Greenwalt 's statement that " Angel is about how hard it is to be a man . " Greenwalt observed that the show raises questions about what it means to be a man and does this not only through the characterization of Angel but also the men around him . He said that like other male characters , taken alone Connor may seem a stereotypical teen boy , but considered with rest of the cast offers a complex image of modern masculinity . Greenwalt also compared Connor 's journey with others in terms of identity , which he considers a poignant theme within the series . He found it ironic that Connor who was " initially the most damaged of all the characters " , was the only one able to " reconcile his actions and new man existence together " and be at peace with himself in the end . 
 = Profumo affair = 
 The Profumo affair was a British political scandal that originated with a brief sexual relationship in 1961 between John Profumo , the Secretary of State for War in Harold Macmillan 's government , and Christine Keeler , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old would @-@ be model . In March 1963 , Profumo denied any impropriety in a personal statement to the House of Commons , but was forced to admit the truth a few weeks later . He resigned from the government and from Parliament . The repercussions of the affair severely damaged Macmillan 's self @-@ confidence , and he resigned as prime minister on health grounds in October 1963 . His Conservative Party was marked by the scandal , which may have contributed to its defeat by Labour in the 1964 general election . 
 When the Profumo – Keeler affair was first revealed , public interest was heightened by reports that Keeler may have been simultaneously involved with Captain Yevgeny Ivanov , a Soviet naval attaché , thereby creating a possible security risk . Keeler knew both Profumo and Ivanov through her friendship with Stephen Ward , an osteopath and socialite who had taken her under his wing . The exposure of the affair generated rumours of other scandals , and drew official attention to the activities of Ward , who was charged with a series of immorality offences . Perceiving himself as a scapegoat for the misdeeds of others , Ward took a fatal overdose during the final stages of his trial , which found him guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Keeler and her friend Mandy Rice @-@ Davies . 
 An inquiry into the affair by a senior judge , Lord Denning , indicated that there had been no breaches of security arising from the Ivanov connection , although Denning 's report was later condemned as superficial and unsatisfactory . Profumo subsequently sought private atonement as a volunteer worker at Toynbee Hall , an East London charitable trust . By 1975 he had been officially rehabilitated , although he did not return to public life . He died in 2006 . 
 Keeler found it difficult to escape the negative image attached to her by press , law and parliament throughout the Profumo affair . In various , sometimes contradictory accounts , she has challenged Denning 's conclusions relating to security issues . Ward 's conviction has been described by analysts as an act of Establishment revenge , rather than serving justice . In January 2014 his case was under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission , with the possibility of a later reference to the Court of Appeal . Dramatisations of the Profumo affair have been shown on stage and screen .

 In the early 1960s British news media were dominated by several high @-@ profile spying stories : the breaking of the Portland spy ring in 1961 , the capture and sentencing of George Blake in the same year and , in 1962 , the case of the Admiralty clerk , John Vassall , blackmailed into spying by the Soviets who threatened to expose his homosexuality . In October 1962 Vassall was jailed for 18 years . After suggestions in the press that Vassall had been shielded by his political masters , the responsible minister , Thomas Galbraith , resigned from the government pending inquiries . Galbraith was later exonerated by the Radcliffe inquiry , which sent two newspaper journalists to prison for refusing to reveal their sources for sensational and uncorroborated stories about Vassall 's private life . The imprisonment severely damaged relations between the press and the Macmillan government ; the New Statesman 's columnist Paul Johnson warned : " [ A ] ny Tory minister or MP ... who gets involved in a scandal during the next year or so must expect — I regret to say — the full treatment " . 
 = = = Profumo = = = 
 John Profumo was born in 1915 , of Italian descent . He first entered Parliament in 1940 as the Conservative member for Kettering , while serving with the Northamptonshire Yeomanry , and combined his political and military duties through the Second World War . He lost his seat in the 1945 general election , but was elected in 1950 for Stratford @-@ on @-@ Avon . From 1951 he held junior ministerial office in successive Conservative administrations . In 1960 , Macmillan promoted him to Secretary of State for War , a senior post outside the cabinet . After his marriage in 1954 to Valerie Hobson , one of Britain 's leading film actresses , he may have conducted casual affairs , using late @-@ night parliamentary sittings as his cover . Profumo 's tenure as war minister coincided with a period of transition in the armed forces , involving the end of conscription and the development of a wholly professional army . His performance was watched with a critical eye by his opposition counterpart George Wigg , a former regular soldier .

 Christine Keeler , born in 1942 , left school at 15 with no qualifications and took a series of short @-@ lived jobs in shops , offices and cafés . She aspired to be a model , and at 16 had a photograph published in Tit @-@ Bits magazine . In August 1959 , she found work as a topless showgirl at Murray 's Cabaret Club in Beak Street , Soho . This long @-@ established club attracted a distinguished clientele who , Keeler wrote , " could look but could not touch " . Shortly after starting at Murray 's , Keeler was introduced to a client , the society osteopath Stephen Ward . Captivated by his charm , she agreed to move into his flat , in a relationship she has described as " like brother and sister " — affectionate but not sexual . She left Ward after a few months to become the mistress of the property dealer Peter Rachman , and later shared lodgings with Mandy Rice @-@ Davies , a fellow Murray 's Club dancer three years her junior . The two girls left Murray 's , and attempted without success to pursue careers as freelance models . Keeler also lived for short periods with various boyfriends , but regularly returned to Ward , who had acquired a house in Wimpole Mews . There she met many of Ward 's friends , among them Lord Astor , a long @-@ time patient who was also a political ally of Profumo . She often spent weekends at a riverside cottage that Ward rented on Astor 's country estate , Cliveden , in Buckinghamshire . 
 = = = Ward and Ivanov = = = 
 Stephen Ward , born in Hertfordshire in 1912 , qualified as an osteopath in the United States . After the Second World War he began practising in Cavendish Square , London , where he rapidly established a reputation and attracted many distinguished patients . These connections , together with his personal charm , brought him considerable social success . In his spare time Ward attended art classes at the Slade school , and developed a profitable sideline in portrait sketches . In 1960 he was commissioned by The Illustrated London News to provide a series of portraits of national and international figures . These included members of the Royal family , among them Prince Philip and Princess Margaret . 
 Ward hoped to visit the Soviet Union to draw portraits of Russian leaders . To help him , one of his patients , the Daily Telegraph editor Sir Colin Coote , arranged an introduction to Yevgeny Ivanov ( anglicised as " Eugene " ) , listed as a naval attaché at the Soviet Embassy . British Intelligence ( MI5 ) knew from the double @-@ agent Oleg <unk> that Ivanov was an intelligence officer in the Soviet GRU . Ward and Ivanov became firm friends . Ivanov frequently visited Ward at Wimpole Mews , where he met Keeler and Rice @-@ Davis , and sometimes joined Ward 's weekend parties at the Cliveden cottage . MI5 considered Ivanov a potential defector , and sought Ward 's help to this end , providing him with a case officer known as " Woods " . Ward was later used by the British Foreign Office as a backchannel , through Ivanov , to the Soviet Union , and was involved in unofficial diplomacy at the time of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis . His closeness to Ivanov raised concerns about his loyalty ; according to Lord Denning 's September 1963 report , Ivanov often asked Ward questions about British foreign policy , and Ward did his best to provide answers .

 = = = Cliveden , July 1961 = = = 
 During the weekend of 8 – 9 July 1961 Keeler was among several guests of Ward at the Cliveden cottage . That same weekend , at the main house , John and Valerie Profumo were among the large gathering from the worlds of politics and the arts which Astor was hosting in honour of Ayub Khan , the president of Pakistan . On the Saturday evening , Ward 's and Astor 's parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool , which Ward and his guests had permission to use . Keeler , who had been swimming naked , was introduced to Profumo while trying to cover herself with a skimpy towel . She was , Profumo informed his son many years later , " a very pretty girl and very sweet " . Keeler did not know , initially , who Profumo was , but was impressed that he was the husband of a famous film star and was prepared to have " a bit of fun " with him . 
 The next afternoon the two parties reconvened at the pool , joined by Ivanov , who had arrived that morning . There followed what Lord Denning described as " a light @-@ hearted and frolicsome bathing party , where everyone was in bathing costumes and nothing indecent took place at all " . Profumo was greatly attracted to Keeler , and promised to be in touch with her . Ward asked Ivanov to accompany Keeler back to London where , according to Keeler , they had sex . Most commentators doubt this — Keeler was generally outspoken about her conquests , yet said nothing about sex with Ivanov until she informed a newspaper 18 months later . 
 On 12 July Ward reported on the weekend 's events to MI5 . He told Woods that Ivanov and Profumo had met and that the latter had shown considerable interest in Keeler . Ward also stated that he had been asked by Ivanov for information about the future arming of West Germany with atomic weapons . This request for military information did not greatly disturb MI5 , who expected a GRU officer to ask such questions . Profumo 's interest in Keeler was an unwelcome complication in their plans to use her in a honey trap operation against Ivanov , to help secure his defection . Woods therefore referred the issue to MI5 's director @-@ general , Sir Roger Hollis . 
 = = = Affair = = = 
 A few days after the Cliveden weekend , Profumo contacted Keeler . The affair that ensued was brief ; some commentators have suggested that it ended after a few weeks , while others believe that it continued , with decreasing fervour , until December 1961 . The relationship has been characterised by Keeler as an unromantic relationship without expectations , a " screw of convenience " , although she also states that Profumo hoped for a longer @-@ term commitment and that he offered to set her up in a flat . More than 20 years later , Profumo described Keeler in conversation with his son as someone who " seem [ ed ] to like sexual intercourse " , but who was " completely uneducated " , with no conversation beyond make @-@ up , hair and gramophone records . 
 The couple usually met at Wimpole Mews , when Ward was absent , although once , when Hobson was away , Profumo took Keeler to his home at Chester Terrace in Regent 's Park . On one occasion he borrowed a Bentley from his ministerial colleague John Hare and took Keeler for a drive around London , and another time the couple had a drink with Viscount Ward , the former Secretary of State for Air . During their time together , Profumo gave Keeler a few small presents , and once , a sum of £ 20 as a gift for her mother . Keeler maintains that although Stephen Ward asked her to obtain information from Profumo about the deployment of nuclear weapons , she did not do so . Profumo was equally adamant that no such discussions took place . 
 On 9 August Profumo was interviewed informally by Sir Norman Brook , the Cabinet Secretary , who had been advised by Hollis of Profumo 's involvement with the Ward circle . Brook warned the minister of the dangers of mixing with Ward 's group , since MI5 were at this stage unsure of Ward 's dependability . It is possible that Brook asked Profumo to help MI5 in its efforts to secure Ivanov 's defection — a request which Profumo declined . Although Brook did not indicate knowledge of Profumo 's relationship with Keeler , Profumo may have suspected that he knew . That same day , Profumo wrote Keeler a letter , beginning " Darling ... " , cancelling an assignation they had made for the following day . Some commentators have assumed that this letter ended the association ; Keeler insists that the affair ended later , after her persistent refusals to stop living with Ward .

 = = = Gordon and Edgecombe = = = 
 In October 1961 Keeler accompanied Ward to Notting Hill , then a run @-@ down district of London replete with West Indian music clubs and cannabis dealers . At the Rio Café they encountered Aloysius " Lucky " Gordon , a Jamaican jazz singer with a history of violence and petty crime . He and Keeler embarked on an affair which , in her own accounts , was marked by equal measures of violence and tenderness on his part . Gordon became very possessive towards Keeler , jealous of her other social contacts . He began confronting her friends , and often telephoned her at unsocial hours . In November Keeler left Wimpole Mews and moved to a flat in Dolphin Square , overlooking the Thames at Pimlico , where she entertained friends and perhaps clients . When Gordon continued to harass her he was arrested by the police and charged with assault . Keeler later agreed to drop the charge . 
 In July 1962 the first <unk> of a possible Profumo @-@ Keeler @-@ Ivanov triangle had been hinted , in coded terms , in the gossip column of the society magazine Queen . Under the heading " Sentences I 'd like to hear the end of " appeared the wording : " ... called in MI5 because every time the chauffeur @-@ driven <unk> drew up at her front door , out of her back door into a chauffeur @-@ driven Humber slipped ... " Keeler was then in New York with Rice @-@ Davies , in an abortive attempt to launch their modelling careers there . On her return , to counter Gordon 's threats , Keeler formed a relationship with Johnny Edgecombe , an ex @-@ merchant seaman from Antigua , with whom she lived for a while in Brentford , just west of London . Edgecombe was similarly possessive ; he and Gordon clashed violently on 27 October 1962 , when Edgecombe slashed his rival with a knife . Keeler broke with Edgecombe shortly afterwards because of his domineering behaviour . 
 On 14 December 1962 Keeler and Rice @-@ Davies were together at 17 Wimpole Mews when Edgecombe arrived , demanding to see Keeler . When he was not allowed in , he fired several shots at the front door . Shortly afterwards Edgecombe was arrested and charged with attempted murder and other offences . In brief press accounts , Keeler was described as " a free @-@ lance model " and " Miss Marilyn Davies " as " an actress " . In the wake of the incident , Keeler began to talk indiscreetly about Ward , Profumo , Ivanov and the Edgecombe shooting . Among those to whom she told her story was John Lewis , a former Labour MP whom she had met by chance in a night club . Lewis , a long @-@ standing enemy of Ward , passed the information to his one @-@ time parliamentary colleague George Wigg , who began his own investigation . 
 = = = Mounting pressures = = = 
 On 22 January 1963 the Soviet government , sensing a possible scandal , recalled Ivanov . Aware of increasing public interest , Keeler attempted to sell her story to the national newspapers . The Radcliffe tribunal 's ongoing inquiry into press behaviour during the Vassall case was making newspapers nervous , and only two showed interest in Keeler 's story : the Sunday Pictorial and the News of the World . As the latter would not join an auction , Keeler accepted the Pictorial 's offer of a £ 200 down payment and a further £ 800 when the story was published . The paper retained a copy of the " Darling " letter . The News of the World then alerted Ward and Astor — whose names had been mentioned by Keeler — and they in turn informed Profumo . When Profumo 's lawyers tried to persuade Keeler not to publish , the compensation she demanded was so large that Profumo 's lawyers considered charges of extortion . Ward informed the Pictorial that Keeler 's story was largely false , and that he and others would sue if it was printed , whereupon the paper withdrew its offer , although Keeler kept the £ 200 . 
 Keeler then gave details of her affair with Profumo to a police officer , who did not pass on this information to MI5 or the legal authorities . By this time , many of Profumo 's political colleagues had heard rumours of his entanglement , and of the existence of a potentially incriminating letter . Nevertheless , his denials were accepted by the government 's principal law officers and the Conservative Chief Whip , although with some private scepticism . Macmillan , mindful of the injustice done to Galbraith on the basis of rumours , was determined to support his minister , and took no action . 
 Edgecombe 's trial began on 14 March but Keeler , one of the Crown 's key witnesses , was missing . She had , without informing the court , gone to Spain , although at this stage her whereabouts were unknown . Her unexplained absence caused a press sensation . Every newspaper knew the rumours linking Keeler with Profumo , but refrained from reporting any direct connection ; in the wake of the Radcliffe inquiry they were , in Wigg 's later words , " willing to wound but afraid to strike " . They could only hint , by front @-@ page juxtapositions of stories and photographs , that Profumo might be connected to Keeler 's disappearance . Despite her absence the judge proceeded with the case ; Edgecombe was found guilty on a lesser charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life , and sentenced to seven years ' imprisonment . A few days after the trial , on 21 March , the satirical magazine Private Eye printed the most detailed summary so far of the rumours , with the main characters lightly disguised : " Mr James <unk> " , " Miss Gaye <unk> " , " Dr Spook " and " Vladimir <unk> " .

 The newly elected leader of the opposition Labour Party , Harold Wilson , was initially advised by his colleagues to have nothing to do with Wigg 's private dossier on the Profumo rumours . On 21 March , with the press furore over the " missing witness " at its height , the party changed its stance . During a House of Commons debate , Wigg used parliamentary privilege to ask the Home Secretary to categorically deny the truth of rumours connecting " a minister " to Keeler , Rice @-@ Davies and the Edgecombe shooting . He did not name Profumo , who was not in the House . Later in the debate Barbara Castle , the Labour MP for Blackburn , referred to the " missing witness " and hinted at a possible perversion of justice . The Home Secretary , Henry Brooke , refused to comment , adding that Wigg and Castle should " seek other means of making these insinuations if they are prepared to substantiate them " . 
 At the conclusion of the debate the government 's law officers and Chief Whip met , and decided that Profumo should assert his innocence in a personal statement to the House . Such statements are , by long @-@ standing tradition , made on the particular honour of the member and are accepted by the House without question . In the early hours of 22 March Profumo and his lawyers met with ministers and together agreed an appropriate wording . Later that morning Profumo made his statement to a crowded House . He acknowledged friendships with Keeler and Ward , the former of whom , he said , he had last seen in December 1961 . He had met " a Mr Ivanov " twice , also in 1961 . He stated : " There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler " , and added : " I shall not hesitate to issue writs for libel and slander if scandalous allegations are made or repeated outside the House . " That afternoon , Profumo was photographed at Sandown Park Racecourse in the company of the Queen Mother . 
 While officially the matter was considered closed , many individual MPs had doubts , although none openly expressed disbelief at this stage . Wigg later said that he left the House that morning " with black rage in my heart because I knew what the facts were . I knew the truth . " Most newspapers were editorially non @-@ committal ; only The Guardian , under the headline " Mr Profumo clears the air " , stated openly that the statement should be taken at its face value . Within a few days press attention was distracted by the re @-@ emergence of Keeler , in Madrid . She expressed astonishment at the fuss her absence had caused , adding that her friendship with Profumo and his wife was entirely innocent and that she had many friends in important positions . She claimed that she had not deliberately missed the Edgecombe trial but had been confused about the date . She was required to forfeit her recognizance of £ 40 , but no other action was taken against her .

 Shortly after Profumo 's Commons statement , Ward appeared on Independent Television News , where he endorsed Profumo 's version and dismissed all rumours and insinuations as " baseless " . Ward 's own activities had become a matter of official concern , and on 1 April the Metropolitan Police began to investigate his affairs . They interviewed 140 of his friends , associates and patients , maintained a 24 @-@ hour watch on his home , and tapped his telephone — this last action requiring direct authorisation from Brooke . Among those who gave statements was Keeler , who contradicted her earlier assurances and confirmed her sexual relationship with Profumo , providing corroborative details of the interior of the Chester Terrace house . The police put pressure on reluctant witnesses ; Rice @-@ Davies was remanded to Holloway Prison for a driving licence offence and held there for eight days until she agreed to testify against Ward . Meanwhile , Profumo was awarded costs and £ 50 damages against the British distributors of an Italian magazine that had printed a story hinting at his guilt . He donated the proceeds to an army charity . This did not deter Private Eye from including " Sextus <unk> " in their parody of Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . 
 On 18 April Keeler was attacked at the home of a friend . She accused Gordon , who was arrested and held . According to Knightley and Kennedy 's account , the police offered to drop the charges if Gordon would testify against Ward , but he refused . The effects of the police inquiry were proving ruinous to Ward , whose practice was collapsing rapidly . On 7 May he met Macmillan 's private secretary , Timothy Bligh , to ask that the police inquiry into his affairs be halted . He added that he had been covering for Profumo , whose Commons statement was substantially false . Bligh took notes but failed to take action . On 19 May Ward wrote to Brooke , with essentially the same request as that to Bligh , to be told that the Home Secretary had no power to interfere with the police inquiry . Ward then gave details to the press , but no paper would print the story . He also wrote to Wilson , who showed the letter to Macmillan . Although privately disdainful of Wilson 's motives , after discussions with Hollis the prime minister was sufficiently concerned about Ward 's general activities to ask the Lord Chancellor , Lord Dilhorne , to inquire into possible security breaches . 
 On 31 May , at the start of the parliamentary Whitsun recess , the <unk> flew to Venice for a short holiday . At their hotel they received a message asking him to return as soon as possible . Believing that his bluff had been called , Profumo then told his wife the truth , and they decided to return immediately . They found that Macmillan was on holiday in Scotland . On Tuesday 4 June Profumo confessed the truth to Bligh , confirming that he had lied , and resigned from the government and from Parliament . Bligh informed Macmillan of these events by telephone . The resignation was announced on 5 June , when the formal exchange of letters between Profumo and Macmillan was published . The Times called Profumo 's lies " a great tragedy for the probity of public life in Britain " ; the Daily Mail recorded Profumo 's fall and disgrace as the price required when public figures fell short of the expected standards of integrity . The Daily Mirror hinted that not all the truth had been told , and referred to " skeletons in many cupboards " . 
 = = = Retribution = = = 
 Gordon 's trial for the attack on Keeler began on the day Profumo 's resignation was made public . He maintained that his innocence would be established by two witnesses who , the police told the court , could not be found . On 7 June , principally on the evidence of Keeler , Gordon was found guilty and sentenced to three years ' imprisonment . The following day , Ward was arrested and charged with immorality offences . On 9 June , freed from Profumo 's libel threats , The News of the World published " The Confessions of Christine " , an account which helped to fashion the public image of Ward as a sexual predator and probable tool of the Soviets . The Sunday Mirror ( formerly the Sunday Pictorial ) printed Profumo 's " Darling " letter . 
 In advance of the House of Commons debate on Profumo 's resignation , due 17 June , David Watt in The Spectator defined Macmillan 's position as " an intolerable dilemma from which he can only escape by being proved either ludicrously naïve or incompetent or deceitful — or all three " . Meanwhile , the press speculated about possible Cabinet resignations , and several ministers felt it necessary to demonstrate their loyalty to the prime minister . In a BBC interview on 13 June Lord Hailsham , holder of several ministerial offices , denounced Profumo in a manner which , according to The Observer 's reporter , " had to be seen to be believed " . Hailsham insisted that " a great party is not to be brought down because of a squalid affair between a woman of easy virtue and a proven liar " . 
 In the debate , Wilson concentrated almost exclusively on the extent to which the prime minister and his colleagues had been dilatory in not identifying a clear security risk arising from Profumo 's association with Ward and his circle . Macmillan responded that he should not be held culpable for believing a colleague who had repeatedly asserted his innocence . He mentioned the false allegations against Galbraith , and the failure of the security services to share their detailed information with him . In the general debate the sexual aspects of the scandal were fully discussed ; Nigel Birch , the Conservative MP for West Flintshire , referred to Keeler as a " professional prostitute " and asked rhetorically : " What are whores about ? " Keeler was otherwise branded a " tart " and a " poor little slut " . Ward was vilified throughout as a likely Soviet agent ; one Conservative referred to " the treason of Dr Ward " . Most Conservatives , whatever their reservations , were supportive of Macmillan , with only Birch suggesting that he should consider retirement . In the subsequent vote on the government 's handling of the affair , 27 Conservatives abstained , reducing the government 's majority to 69 . Most newspapers considered the extent of the defection significant , and several forecast that Macmillan would soon resign . 
 After the parliamentary debate , newspapers published further sensational stories , hinting at widespread immorality within Britain 's governing class . A story emanating from Rice @-@ Davies concerned a naked masked man , who acted as a waiter at sex parties ; rumours suggested that he was a cabinet minister , or possibly a member of the Royal Family . Malcolm Muggeridge in the Sunday Mirror wrote of " The Slow , Sure Death of the Upper Classes " . On 21 June Macmillan instructed Lord Denning , the Master of the Rolls , to investigate and report on the growing range of rumours . Ward 's committal proceedings began a week later , at Marylebone magistrates ' court , where the Crown 's evidence was fully reported in the press . Ward was committed for trial on charges of " living off the earnings of prostitution " and " <unk> of girl under twenty @-@ one " , and released on bail . 
 With the Ward case now sub <unk> , the press pursued related stories . The People reported that Scotland Yard had begun an inquiry , in parallel with Denning 's , into " homosexual practices as well as sexual laxity " among civil servants , military officers and MPs . On 24 June the Daily Mirror , under a banner heading " Prince Philip and the Profumo Scandal " , dismissed what it termed the " foul rumour " that the prince had been involved in the affair , without disclosing the nature of the rumour . 
 Ward 's trial began at the Old Bailey on 28 July . He was charged with living off the earnings of Keeler , Rice @-@ Davies and two other prostitutes , and with procuring women under 21 to have sex with other persons . The thrust of the prosecution 's case related to Keeler and Rice @-@ Davies , and turned on whether the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments they had given to Ward while living with him amounted to his living off their prostitution . Ward 's approximate income at the time , from his practice and from his portraiture , had been around £ 5 @,@ 500 a year , a substantial sum at that time . In his speeches and examination of witnesses , the prosecuting counsel Mervyn Griffith @-@ Jones portrayed Ward as representing " the very depths of lechery and depravity " . The judge , Sir Archie Marshall , was equally hostile , drawing particular attention to the fact that none of Ward 's supposed society friends had been prepared to speak up for him . Towards the end of the trial , news came that Gordon 's conviction for assault had been overturned ; Marshall did not disclose to the jury that Gordon 's witnesses had turned up and testified that Keeler , a key prosecution witness against Ward , had given false evidence at Gordon 's trial . 
 After listening to Marshall 's damning summing @-@ up , on the evening of 30 July Ward took an overdose of sleeping tablets and was taken to hospital . On the next day he was found guilty in absentia on the charges relating to Keeler and Rice @-@ Davies , and acquitted on the other counts . Sentence was postponed until Ward was fit to appear , but on 3 August he died without regaining consciousness . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Lord Denning 's report was awaited with great anticipation by the public . Published on 26 September , it concluded that there had been no security leaks in the Profumo affair and that the security services and government ministers had acted appropriately . Profumo had been guilty of an " indiscretion " , but no one could doubt his loyalty . Denning also found no evidence to link members of the government with associated scandals such as the " man in the mask " . He laid most of the blame for the affair on Ward , an " utterly immoral " man whose diplomatic activities were " misconceived and misdirected " . Although The Spectator considered that the report marked the end of the affair , many commentators were disappointed with its content . Young found many questions unanswered and some of the reasoning defective , while Davenport @-@ Hines , writing long after the event , condemns the report as disgraceful , slipshod and prurient . 
 After the Denning Report , in defiance of general expectations that he would resign shortly , Macmillan announced his intention to stay on . On the eve of the Conservative Party 's annual conference in October 1963 he fell ill ; his condition was less serious than he imagined , and his life was not in danger but , convinced he had cancer , he resigned abruptly . His successor as prime minister was Lord Home , who renounced his peerage and served as Sir Alec Douglas @-@ Home . In the October 1964 general election the Conservative Party was narrowly defeated , and Wilson became prime minister . A later commentator opined that the Profumo affair had destroyed the old , aristocratic Conservative party : " It wouldn 't be too much to say that the Profumo scandal was the necessary prelude to the new Toryism , based on meritocracy , which would eventually emerge under Margaret Thatcher " . The Economist suggested that the Profumo affair had effected a fundamental and permanent change in relations between politicians and press . Davenport @-@ Hines posits a longer @-@ term consequence of the affair — the gradual ending of traditional notions of deference : " Authority , however disinterested , well @-@ qualified and experienced , was [ after June 1963 ] increasingly greeted with suspicion rather than trust " . 
 After expressing his " deep remorse " to the prime minister , to his constituents and to the Conservative Party , Profumo disappeared from public view . In April 1964 he began working as a volunteer at the Toynbee Hall settlement , a charitable organisation based in Spitalfields which supports the most deprived residents in the East End of London . Profumo continued his association with the settlement for the remainder of his life , at first in a menial capacity , then as administrator , fund @-@ raiser , council member , chairman and finally president . His charitable work was recognised when he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in 1975 . He was later described by Margaret Thatcher as a national hero , and was a guest at her 80th birthday celebrations in 2005 . His marriage to Valerie Hobson endured until her death in 1998 ; Profumo died , aged 90 , on 9 March 2006 . 
 In December 1963 Keeler admitted her perjury at Gordon 's June trial , and subsequently served six months in prison . Since then , after two brief failed marriages which produced two children , she has largely lived alone . Most of the considerable amount she made from newspaper stories was dissipated by lawyers ; during the 1970s , she said , " I was not living , I was surviving . " She has published several inconsistent accounts of her life , in which Ward has been variously represented as a " gentleman " , her truest love , a Soviet spy , and a traitor ranking alongside Philby , Burgess and Maclean . She has also claimed that Profumo impregnated her and that she subsequently underwent a painful abortion . Her portrait , by Ward , was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in 1984 . Rice @-@ Davies enjoyed a more successful post @-@ scandal career , as nightclub owner , businesswoman , minor actress and novelist . She was married three times , in what she described as her " slow descent into respectability " . Of adverse press publicity she observed : " Like royalty , I simply do not complain " . Mandy Rice @-@ Davies died in December 2014 , aged 70 . 
 Ward 's role on behalf of MI5 was confirmed in 1982 , when the Sunday Times located his former contact " Woods " . Although Denning always asserted that Ward 's trial and conviction were fair and proper , most commentators believe that it was deeply flawed — an " historical injustice " according to Davenport @-@ Hines , who argues that the trial was an act of political revenge . One High Court judge said privately that he would have stopped the trial before it reached the jury . The human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has campaigned for the case to be reopened on several grounds , including the premature scheduling of the trial , lack of evidence to support the main charges , and various misdirections by the trial judge in his summing up . Above all , the judge failed to advise the jury of the evidence revealed in the Gordon appeal that Keeler , the prosecution 's chief witness against Ward , had committed perjury at the Gordon trial . In January 2014 Ward 's case was being considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission , which has the power to investigate suspected miscarriages of justice and refer cases to the Court of Appeal . 
 After his recall in January 1963 , Ivanov disappeared for several decades . In 1992 his memoirs , The Naked Spy , were serialised in The Sunday Times . When this account was challenged by Profumo 's lawyers , the publishers removed offending material . In August 2015 the i on Saturday newspaper published a preview of a forthcoming history of Soviet intelligence activities , by Jonathan Haslam . This book suggests that the relationship between Ivanov and Profumo was closer than the latter has admitted . It is alleged that Ivanov visited Profumo 's home , and that such was the slackness of security arrangements that the Russian was able to photograph sensitive documents left lying about in the minister 's study . 
 Keeler describes meeting Ivanov in Moscow , in 1993 ; she also records that he died the following year . Astor was deeply upset at finding himself under police investigation , and by the social ostracism that followed the Ward trial . After his death in 1966 Cliveden was sold . It became first the property of Stanford University , and later a luxury hotel . Rachman , who had first come to public notice as a sometime boyfriend of Keeler and Rice @-@ Davies , was revealed as an unscrupulous slum landlord ; the word " <unk> " entered English dictionaries as the standard term for landlords who exploit or intimidate their tenants . 
 = = Dramatisations = = 
 There have been several dramatised versions of the Profumo affair . The 1989 film Scandal featured Ian McKellen as Profumo and John Hurt as Ward . It was favourably reviewed , but the revival of interest in the affair upset the Profumo family . The focus of Hugh Whitemore 's play A Letter of Resignation , first staged at the Comedy Theatre in October 1997 , was Macmillan 's reactions to Profumo 's resignation letter , which he received while on holiday in Scotland . Andrew Lloyd Webber 's musical Stephen Ward opened at London 's Aldwych Theatre on 3 December 2013 . Among generally favourable reviews , the Daily Telegraph 's critic recommended the production as " sharp , funny – and , at times , genuinely touching " . Robertson records that the script is " remarkably faithful to the facts " .

 = Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion = 
 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion is a 1944 triptych painted by the Irish @-@ born British artist Francis Bacon . The canvasses are based on the Eumenides — or Furies — of Aeschylus 's Oresteia , and depict three writhing anthropomorphic creatures set against a flat burnt orange background . It was executed in oil paint and pastel on <unk> fibre board and completed within two weeks . 
 The triptych summarises themes explored in Bacon 's previous work , including his examination of Picasso 's <unk> and his interpretations of the Crucifixion and the Greek Furies . Bacon did not realise his original intention to paint a large crucifixion scene and place the figures at the foot of the cross . 
 The Three Studies are generally considered Bacon 's first mature piece ; he regarded his works before the triptych as irrelevant , and throughout his life tried to suppress their appearance on the art market . When the painting was first exhibited in 1945 it caused a sensation and established him as one of the foremost post @-@ war painters . Remarking on the cultural significance of Three Studies , the critic John Russell observed in 1971 that " there was painting in England before the Three Studies , and painting after them , and no one ... can confuse the two " . 
 = = Background = = 
 As an artist , Francis Bacon was a late starter . He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s , when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs . He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest . He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933 , when his then @-@ patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject . These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time , including diaphanous forms , flat backgrounds , and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas . The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are " aesthetically pleasing " , they lack " a sense of urgency or inner necessity ; they are beautiful , but lifeless " . The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies , who wrote that Bacon 's 1933 paintings " suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns " . Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful ; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance . He was often harshly self @-@ critical during this period , and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed . He abandoned the Crucifixion theme , then largely withdrew from painting in frustration , instead immersing himself in love affairs , drinking and gambling . 
 When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later , he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier , such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia . He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career — three lines radiating from this central figure , which was first seen in Crucifixion , 1933 . Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944 , when , Bacon recalled , " I was in a bad mood of drinking , and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . I think perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . " The painting was executed in a ground @-@ floor flat at 7 Cromwell Place , South Kensington in London . A large back room in the building had been converted into a billiard room by its previous occupant , artist John Everett Millais . It was Bacon 's studio by day ; at night , abetted by Eric Hall and Bacon 's childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot , it functioned as an illicit casino . 
 Although he had been painting for almost twenty years , Bacon steadfastly insisted that Three Studies was the fons et <unk> of his career . He destroyed many of his earlier canvasses , and tried to suppress those that had left his studio . Bacon was emphatic that no pre @-@ 1944 images be admitted into his canon , and most of the early art critics agreed with this position . The early publications of John Russell and David Sylvester open with the 1944 triptych , and Bacon insisted to his death that no retrospective should feature paintings pre @-@ dating 1944 .

 The panels of Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion are painted on light <unk> boards , a material Bacon was using at the time as an inexpensive alternative to canvas . Each bears a single taut sculptural form pitched against a harsh orange background . The orange hue displays inconsistently across the canvasses , due in part to the low level of oil in the paint , which resulted in varying rates of absorption into the board . The pallid flesh tones of the figures were achieved by overlaying grey and white brushstrokes , while the figures ' props were coloured using a variety of yellow , green , white , and purple tones . 
 The art critic Hugh Davies has suggested that of the three figures , that on the left most closely resembles a human form , and that it might represent a mourner at the cross . Seated on a table @-@ like structure , this limbless creature has an elongated neck , heavily rounded shoulders , and a thick mop of dark hair . Like its sister objects , the left @-@ hand figure is portrayed with layers of white and grey paint . The central figure 's mouth is positioned directly on its neck , rather than on a distinct face . It bares its teeth as if in a snarl , and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage — a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald 's Mocking of Christ . This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating from the base of the pedestal . 
 Situated on an isolated patch of grass , the right @-@ hand figure 's toothed mouth is stretched open as if screaming , although David Sylvester has suggested that it may be yawning . Its mouth is open to a degree impossible for a human skull . The orange background of this panel is brighter than the hues rendered in the other frames , and the figure 's neck opens up into a row of teeth , while a protruding ear juts out from behind its lower jaw . This panel closely resembles an earlier painting by Bacon , Untitled , c . 1943 , which was thought destroyed until it re @-@ emerged in 1997 . 
 Inspection under infrared has revealed that the panels were heavily reworked during a number of revisions . The legs of the central figure are surrounded by small magenta horseshoe shapes , which infrared shows to have been first drafted as flowers . The area below the head is thickly coated with white and orange paint , while the inspection exposes a series of underlying curved brushstrokes used to compose a landscape , and a small distant reclining figure . When the canvas is unframed , a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board , indicating that the composition was carefully conceived . 
 Bacon said in a 1959 letter that the figures in Three Studies were " intended to [ be ] use [ d ] at the base of a large Crucifixion which I may still do . " By this , Bacon implied that the figures were conceived as a predella to a larger altarpiece . The biographer Michael Peppiatt has suggested that the panels may have emerged as single works , and that the idea of combining them as a triptych came later . There is little in the themes or styles of the three panels to suggest that they were originally conceived as a whole . Though they share the same orange background , Bacon had already used this colour in two prior pieces ; moreover , his oeuvre can be characterized by periods that are dominated by a single background colour . From the beginning of his career , Bacon preferred to work in series and found that his imagination was stimulated by sequences ; as he put it , " images breed other images in me . " 
 The Crucifixion itself is conspicuously absent , and there is no trace or shadow of its presence in the panels . Writing in 1996 , Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced Christ and the two thieves crucified on either side of him . The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso 's late 1920s and mid @-@ 1930s pictures of <unk> on beaches , in particular from the Spanish artist 's The Bathers ( 1937 ) . However , the eroticism and comedy of Picasso 's figures have been replaced by a sense of menace and terror derived in part from Matthias Grünewald 's Mocking of Christ . 
 = = Themes and style = = 
 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion is a key precursor to Bacon 's later work , and he sustained its formal and thematic preoccupations throughout his career . The triptych format , the placement of figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames , the open mouth , the use of painterly distortion , the Furies , and the theme of the Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works . Bacon 's principal mode of expression is introduced : the subjects are anatomically and physically distorted , and the mood is violent , foreboding , and relentlessly physical . In other respects the triptych stands apart from other paintings in his oeuvre . It refers directly to its inspirations , and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner . The triptych is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space ; by 1948 , Bacon 's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces . 
 Although Bacon stated that he modelled the creatures on the Furies , the visual link to the sources is barely perceptible in his finished work . The mood and tone of the painting , however , is consistent with the agonized spirit of the Furies ' legend . They are traditionally depicted as ancient chthonic deities preoccupied with avenging patricide and matricide by hunting down and killing violent criminals . In Aeschylus ' The Oresteia , the title character is pursued by the Furies in revenge for the murder of his mother Clytemnestra . The saga tells the story of the decimation of the line of Atreus ; Clytemnestra had hacked to death her husband Agamemnon , and later slew Cassandra , who had foreseen the murders and declared : " Drunken , drunken with blood / To make them dare the more , a reveling rout / Is in the rooms which no man shall cast out , of sister Furies . " 
 Bacon did not seek to illustrate the narrative of the tale , however . He told the French art critic Michel Leiris , " I could not paint Agamemnon , Clytemnestra or Cassandra , as that would have been merely another kind of historical painting ... Therefore I tried to create an image of the effect it produced inside me . " Aeschylus ' phrase " the reek of human blood smiles out at me " in particular haunted Bacon , and his treatments of the mouth in the triptych and many subsequent paintings were attempts to visualise the sentiment . In 1985 , he observed that Aeschylus ' phrase brought up in him " the most exciting images , and I often read it ... the violence of it brings up the images in me , ' the reek of human blood smiles out at me ' , well what could be more amazing than that . " 
 Bacon was introduced to Aeschylus through T. S. Eliot 's 1939 play The Family Reunion , in which the protagonist Harry is haunted by " the sleepless hunters / that will not let me sleep " . In Eliot 's play , the Furies serve as embodiments of the remorse and guilt felt by Harry , who harbours a dark family secret , shared only with his sister . Bacon was captivated by Aeschylus ' play , and keen to learn more about Greek tragedy , although he said many times that he regretted being unable to read the original in Greek . In 1942 , he read the Irish scholar William Bedell Stanford 's Aeschylus in his Style , and found the theme of obsessive guilt in The Oresteia to be highly resonant . In 1984 , Bacon told Sylvester that although his painting 's subject matter did not have a direct relationship with the poet 's work , for him Eliot 's work " opened the valves of sensation " . 
 The mouth of the triptych 's central figure was also inspired by the nurse 's scream in film director Sergei Eisenstein 's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in The Battleship Potemkin ( 1925 ) . In 1984 , the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg confronted Bacon with a reproduction of the centre panel during the filming of a South Bank Show documentary , and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth . Bacon replied , " I had always thought that I would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so . " When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed , Bacon admitted , " It should be all much more colour , should have got more of the interior of the mouth , with all the colours of the interior of the mouth , but I didn 't happen to get it . " 
 Other than in Picasso 's exploration of the theme , the Crucifixion did not figure prominently in twentieth @-@ century painting . The Surrealists exploited its shock value , and it was used as a vehicle for blasphemy in isolated instances . Bacon often expressed his admiration for the manner in which old masters such as Cimabue treated the Crucifixion ; however , as with Picasso , he was more interested in tackling the subject from a secular , humanist point of view . For Three Studies , Bacon did not approach the Crucifixion as a Christian image per se , but rather found that the scene reflected a particular view of humanity he held . As he told David Sylvester : " it was just an act of man 's behaviour , a way of behaviour to another . " 
 The Passion of Christ became a central concern during the early development of Bacon 's work , and he returned to the subject throughout his career . When asked by critic Jean Clair why his Crucifixion scenes tended to comprise mainly " slaughter , butchery , mutilated meat and flesh " , Bacon replied , " that 's all the Crucifixion was , isn 't it ? ... Actually , you can 't think of anything more barbaric than the Crucifixion , and that particular way of killing somebody . " While Three Studies may have begun as an attempt to directly represent the Crucifixion scene , his explorations led him towards " something completely different " . Bacon came to regard the scene as an armature for exploring new ways of representing human behaviours and emotions . For him it amounted to a kind of self @-@ portraiture ; a vehicle for working on " all sorts of very private feelings about behaviour and about the way life is " . 
 Coming in 1944 , the triptych was often thought to be informed by the Second World War . Art critic Ziva <unk> @-@ <unk> observes that the canvas reflects Bacon 's own confusion and ambivalence " towards manifestations of violence and power , both of which attracted and repulsed him simultaneously . " 
 = = Critical reaction = = 
 Three Studies was first shown at a joint exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery , London , in April 1945 , alongside work by Henry Moore and Graham Sutherland . Bacon was then unknown and it is likely that his painting was included at the request of Sutherland , his close friend at the time . The show opened just two months after the end of the Second World War , and John Russell has observed that the immediate post @-@ war period in British history was marked by an atmosphere of nostalgia and optimism — a sense that " everything was going to be alright , and visitors went into the Lefevre in a spirit of thanksgiving for perils honourably surmounted . " 
 Both the public and critics were unnerved by the sight of the work . Russell describes being shocked by " images so <unk> awful that the mind shut with a snap at the sight of them . Their anatomy was half @-@ human , half @-@ animal , and they were confined in a low @-@ ceilinged , windowless and oddly proportioned space . They could bite , probe , and suck , and they had very long eel @-@ like necks , but their functioning in other respects was mysterious . Ears and mouths they had , but two at least of them were sightless . " Writing for Apollo magazine , Herbert Furst recalled , " I , I must confess , was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that I was glad to escape from this exhibition . Perhaps it was the red [ sic ] background that made me think of entrails , of an anatomy or a vivisection and feel squeamish . The triptych caused a sensation , and overnight turned Bacon into the most controversial painter in the country . 
 Reviewing for the New Statesman and Nation , Raymond Mortimer wrote that the panels " seems served from Picasso 's Crucifixion [ 1930 ] , but further distorted , with ostrich necks and button heads protruding from bags — the whole effect gloomily phallic , like Bosch without the humour . These objects are perched on stools , and depicted as if they were sculpture , as in the Picassos of 1930 . I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon 's uncommon gifts , but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [ to me ] symbols of outrage rather than works of art . If peace redresses him , he may delight as he now <unk> . " Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public , Bacon offered , " I 've never known why my paintings are known as horrible . I 'm always labelled with horror , but I never think about horror . Pleasure is such a diverse thing . And horror is too . Can you call the famous <unk> altar a horror piece ? Its one of the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion , with the body studded with thorns like nails , but oddly enough the form is so grand it takes away from the horror . But that is the horror in the sense that it is so <unk> ; isn 't that how people came out of the great tragedies ? People came out as though purged into happiness , into a fuller reality of existence . " 
 More recently , the Irish author Colm Tóibín noted in 2006 that the triptych has retained its " genuinely startling " impact . Matthew Kieran wrote , in his 2005 essay on the painting , that " these frightened , blind , raging figures are visceral in their impact , jolting one into sensations of fright , horror , isolation and angst . We react to them as self @-@ conscious creatures , their postures and expressions revealing feelings of petrified isolation , searing horror , pain and blind confusion . " As of 2007 , Three Studies is part of the Tate Gallery 's permanent collection , having been donated by Bacon 's lover Eric Hall in 1953 . 
 = = Second Version of Triptych 1944 ( 1988 ) = = 
 See Second Version of Triptych 1944 
 Bacon often created second versions of his major paintings . In 1988 , he completed a near @-@ copy of the original Three Studies . At 78 × 58 inches ( 198 × 147 cm ) , this second version is more than twice the size of the original , and the orange background has been replaced by a blood @-@ red hue . The figures occupy a smaller proportion of the canvas than those of the 1944 version , a device which , according to the Tate Gallery 's catalogue , " <unk> [ es ] them into a deep void " . 
 Critical opinion was mixed ; the 1988 triptych drew criticism from those who felt that its more refined painting technique robbed the image of much of its power . Denis Farr suggested that while the second version 's larger scale gave it " a majestic quality which is highly effective " , its svelte presentation lessened its shock value . Critic Jonathan Meades felt that while the 1988 triptych was a more polished and painterly work , it lacked the rawness of the original . 
 Reflecting on Bacon 's tendency to revisit subject matter , Meades observed that " Bacon 's auto @-@ plagiarism in areas other than portraiture had less deleterious consequences . Nonetheless the 1988 version ( or near copy ) of the great 1944 Crucifixion Triptych is the lesser work : it is slicker , more polished and it evinces a greater ease with paint . The backgrounds are now elaborated , defined and bereft of the garish , grating poison orange of 1944 . " The art critic James <unk> found that despite these differences , the second version still achieves the power and impact of the first .

 " King @-@ Size Homer " is the seventh episode of The Simpsons ' seventh season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 5 , 1995 . In the episode , Homer despises the nuclear plant 's new exercise program , and decides to gain 61 pounds ( 28 kg ) in order to claim a disability and work at home . Homer soon begins to experience the negative aspects of being obese , and his life starts falling apart . 
 The episode was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Jim Reardon . Joan Kenley makes her second of three guest appearances on The Simpsons in the episode as the voice of the telephone lady . It features cultural references to world 's heaviest twins , the 1993 film What 's Eating Gilbert Grape , and the soft drink Tab . Since airing , the episode has received positive reviews from fans and television critics , and Empire named it the best episode of the show . It acquired a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 0 , and was the third highest rated show on the Fox network that week . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mr. Burns organizes a morning calisthenics program at the nuclear power plant , much to everyone 's delight but to the dismay of Homer ( the only worker who hates doing five minutes of light aerobic exercise ) . After learning that someone who is disabled can work from home , and thus be excluded from the exercise program , Homer tries to find a way to achieve this goal . Homer soon discovers that any employee that weighs 300 pounds ( 136 kg ) or more qualifies as disabled , and so he decides to gain the 61 pounds he needs to reach 300 . He begins eating excessively , despite Marge and Lisa 's repeated warnings that he could seriously endanger his health . With Bart 's help , Homer soon reaches his goal , and Mr. Burns installs a stay @-@ at @-@ home work terminal in the Simpson house . 
 Homer is given simple responsibilities but he still neglects his responsibilities as a safety inspector by simply typing " yes " every time the system prompts him . He also discovers he can no longer fit in his clothes , and he takes up wearing a muumuu as a result . Looking for shortcuts , he leaves his terminal , with a drinking bird to press the Y key to indicate " yes " on the keyboard and goes out to see a film . Refused admission because of his size , Homer is angered after the cinema manager and other members of the public tease him about his appearances . He immediately leaves , claiming that he is not food crazy and that overweight people are as hardworking as anyone else . Returning home , he discovers in his absence that the nodding drinking bird fell over and that a nuclear meltdown is about to take place at the plant unless the system is manually shut down . As he is unable to prevent it via the computer and unable to phone the plant and warn them because his fingers have become too fat to dial properly , Homer tries to run , skateboard , and drive to the plant , all of which fail as a result of his obesity . He eventually gets to the plant by stealing an ice cream truck . Homer arrives at the power plant and climbs up to reach the manual shutdown button , but ends up accidentally falling onto the gas store , blocking the release tube with the oversized lower half of his body and thus preventing the explosion . As a reward for turning the " potential Chernobyl " into a " mere Three Mile Island " , Mr. Burns gives Homer a medal and guarantees that he will make Homer thin once more after he gets decontaminated from the tank . But when Homer could not even do one sit @-@ up in their first work @-@ out session , Mr. Burns reluctantly decides to simply pay for liposuction instead , much to Homer 's delight .

 " King @-@ Size Homer " was written by Dan Greaney , and directed by Jim Reardon . It was the first episode Greaney wrote for The Simpsons . Prior to this episode he was working as a lawyer and was contemplating moving to Kiev , Ukraine , to work for a start @-@ up company . He said that this episode " saved " him from doing so . Greaney pitched some ideas to the writing staff , but none of them were any good , so then @-@ show runner Bill Oakley gave him the idea for this episode . Oakley had Greaney come to Hollywood to write it , and when Greaney showed the first draft to the staff , they liked it , so Oakley hired him . 
 The writers wanted the title of the episode to make Homer sound proud about his weight , so they decided to name it " King @-@ Size Homer " . Greaney really enjoyed working on the episode because Homer is constantly happy and goal oriented in it , instead of being a slob and " eating all the time " . The Simpsons animator David Silverman designed the fat Homer for the episode . There was a discussion about what Homer would wear when he became fat , and they decided to go with a muumuu dress . The writers were also discussing about how they were going to treat Homer 's fatness . They did not want Homer to come off as a " hog " , so they decided that the viewer should barely see him eating after he reaches his 300 pounds goal . As the writers were trying to figure out a way to get Homer back to his old weight by the end of the episode , someone suggested that Homer should feel bad about his obesity , and therefore become thin for Marge , but that idea was scrapped in early production . Action figurines based on fat Homer were made for the World of Springfield series shortly after the episode had aired . 
 Homer has a dream in which he is standing at the foot of a mountain with 300 pounds as the goal at the top . A pig wearing a tuxedo appears next to him in the dream , and motivates Homer to reach the top of the mountain . Homer takes a bite of the pig 's arm , and runs up the mountain . This scene was inspired by the cover of the " Sweetness and Light " issue of the National Lampoon magazine . The staff thought that Cary Grant would have been the ideal for the pig in Homer 's dream sequence , but he died nine years before the episode was made , so they used cast member Hank Azaria for that voice . Joan Kenley guest starred in the episode as the telephone lady who tells Homer : " The fingers you have used to dial are too fat . To obtain a special dialing wand , please mash the keypad with your palm now . " The staff flew her down from Northern California to record her part for the episode .

 While Homer is in the clothes store , as the camera pans with him , two mannequins wearing similar outfits and riding on bikes are shown . These are based on Billy and Benny McCrary , the world 's heaviest twins who weighed over 700 pounds ( 318 kg ) each . They received fame after appearing in the The Guinness Book of World Records in a picture that depicts the twins riding their Honda motorcycles . Also Homer operates an Apple Lisa as his stay @-@ at @-@ home work terminal when the Apple Lisa was discontinued in 1986 . They would appear again in the same season in the episode " The Day the Violence Died " . The scene in which Bart and his friends observe the obese Homer through a window is based on a scene from the 1993 film What 's Eating Gilbert Grape . 
 Homer thinks that he can order the soft drink Tab by pressing the tab key on the keyboard . When Homer vents gas from a nuclear reactor , the gas destroys crops of corn . A farmer looks and says , " Oh no , the corn ! Paul Newman 's gonna have ma ' legs broke ! " This is in reference to the legend of Newman 's Own popcorn products , in which Newman threatened anyone who might attempt to steal his popcorn .

" King @-@ Size Homer " appeared on The Star @-@ Ledger 's list of the ten best episodes on The Simpsons that represent the comic and emotional scope of the show . The Herald Sun put the episode at ninth place on their list of the top twenty episodes of The Simpsons , and highlighted the scene in which Homer is seen " commandeering an ice cream truck in a frantic dash to the nuclear plant to avoid an impending meltdown " . Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named the episode the show 's fifth best , stating " while there are a lot of funny jokes in this episode ( including Homer 's fingers that are too fat to dial ) , the best thing about it is the sight of Homer , weighing well over 300 pounds , dressed in a muumuu and a ' fat guy hat . ' The climax is a little forced and cartoon @-@ y ... but Homer 's weight gain works so well visually that the episode gets away with a lot more than it might . "

" Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be during Homer 's shopping trip to The Vast <unk> . The website concluded its review by giving the episode a grade of A. DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and called it " one of the series ' more cynical episodes " , and said that it " pours on the laughs " . He continued by saying , " It 's amusing to see Homer 's pursuit of obesity , and it exploits his idiocy well . It lacks the expected <unk> about the plight of fat folks , though it does make a point about sensitivity in an understated way . " Despite the numerous laughs at Homer 's appearance from the staff of The Simpsons on the DVD audio commentary for the episode , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote : " this isn 't one of the best episodes . Homer 's at his most irritating and childish here — you really want Marge to beat him up . " They added that Homer 's antics with the computer , such as the scene in which he tries to find the any key , and Mr. Burns running exercise classes are the highlights of the episode . 
 Nick Offerman has cited this as his favorite Simpsons episode . 
 = Spring Creek Dam = 
 Spring Creek Debris Dam is an earthfill dam on Spring Creek , a tributary of the Sacramento River , in Shasta County in the U.S. state of California . Completed in 1963 , the dam , maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation , serves primarily to collect severe acid mine drainage stemming from the Iron Mountain Mine . The dam forms the Spring Creek Reservoir , less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) long . Spring Creek and South Fork Spring Creek flow into the reservoir from a 16 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 41 km2 ) watershed . The dam is directly upstream from the city of Keswick , California and the Keswick Reservoir . The operation is part of the Trinity River Division of the Central Valley Project . 
 The primary purpose of the Spring Creek Dam was to collect acid mine drainage from the old Iron Mountain Mine , which was heavily polluting Spring Creek and its tributaries . The dam was built in response to these pollutants that were contaminating the Sacramento River , the primary water supply for millions of Californians . Although the watershed is small in comparison to that of the Sacramento River , the stream is among the most polluted and acidic in the world . 
 The dam and reservoir , along with other treatment structures built at and below the mine , have successfully reduced the dry weather pollution of Spring Creek by up to ninety @-@ five percent . Problems , though , still occur mainly in the form of large uncontrolled spills from the reservoir . Several concerns about the structural integrity and safety of the dam , both physically and biologically , arose in the 1990s . Emergency releases from Shasta Lake , often in the value of thousands of acre feet of water , have occurred from time to time to dilute massive acid spills from the Spring Creek drainage .

 = = = Mining = = = 
 The Iron Mountain Mine , the most productive copper mine in California in at least one point along its history , operated along the banks of two Spring Creek tributaries , upstream from the current dam site , from 1879 to the 1960s . The mine extracted iron ore , silver , gold , copper sulfide ore , and pyrite from a rock formation dating to approximately 780 @,@ 000 years ago . The potential of a mine at the site was discovered in 1860 , when two men , surveyor William Magee and settler Charles Camden , discovered an extensive iron ore deposit along one of the tributaries of Spring Creek . In 1879 , silver was also discovered at the site , and the mine was begun . The ownership was transferred to Mountain Mines Ltd . , a London company , in 1894 . At the very end of the 19th century , Iron Mountain Mine took blames for several fish kills in the Sacramento River . Nevertheless , mining activity continued , and by 1928 , 600 tons of ore were being extracted from the site per day . 
 The still continuing problem of Iron Mountain Mine runoff has once been described as : 
 ... [ acid mine drainage is ] most vividly illustrated by the problems at the Iron Mountain Mine in California . 
 ... release of this waste resulted in virtual elimination of aquatic life in many of the creeks surrounding the Iron Mountain Mine site . 
 ... work is continuing on what is possibly the largest and most difficult acid mine drainage problem in the United States .

 The construction of Shasta Dam and its afterbay ( regulating downstream dam ) , Keswick Dam , in 1943 and 1950 , respectively , severely impaired the capability of the Sacramento River to flush away pollutants from the mine . Acid mine drainage flowed , unfettered , down Spring Creek directly into the Keswick Reservoir , depositing contaminated sediment and turning a portion of the water a rusty red shade . Previously , the water would have continued down the creek into the river , and flushed to the Pacific Ocean . The pooling of the water , however , made it extremely difficult for the pollutants to be removed . From 1955 to 1962 , open pit mining began on the site . At its peak , the mine discharged 5 tons of iron , 650 pounds ( 290 kg ) of copper , and 1 @,@ 800 pounds ( 820 kg ) of zinc into the stream per day . By then , the water flowing down the drainage was so contaminated that it necessitated the construction of a holding dam , the Spring Creek Dam . 
 Spring Creek Dam was begun in 1961 , when a company named Gibbons and Reed was awarded the contract . The clearing operations began in July of that same year , and the dam was officially dedicated by the Bureau of Reclamation on September 12 , 1961 . Construction of the dam began on October 20 , 1961 , with the placing of the dam embankment , which at least partially consists of acidic sediment dredged from Spring Creek . <unk> was laid on the upstream face of the dam beginning November 9 of that year . In 1962 , a series of labor strikes impacted communities in the Central Valley , also affecting construction of the dam , which was temporarily halted on May 3 of that year . After work restarted on June 26 , <unk> core material for the dam was soon out of supply , so impervious material was used to complete the dam core . 
 Eventually , the Iron Mountain Mine closed , but pollution continued and still continues , and in 1983 , the Iron Mountain Mine was listed on the National Priorities List . The Iron Mountain Mine is known for having the most acidic naturally found water content on Earth , with samples having up to a − 3 @.@ 6 pH value when tested in the early 1990s , which is roughly 100 times the acidity of battery acid . However , this pH value is only found inside and near the mine , as the average pH of water entering the Spring Creek Reservoir is 4 @.@ 12 . 
 = = = Storage expansion = = = 
 The Spring Creek Dam was later deemed " undersized " for the Spring Creek watershed , as the large flows of both natural drainage and acid mine drainage caused frequent uncontrollable spills at the dam . The spills contain many volatile components in acid mine drainage , which include the most acidic naturally occurring ( i.e. not in a laboratory ) water on Earth . Several alternatives were considered for <unk> this problem : 
 <unk> the Spring Creek Dam to create a reservoir three times its original size : This plan was considered , but never built , as the cost of it was estimated at US $ 75 million . 
 Partial capping ( covering ) of the site : The ore body in Iron Mountain was determined to be shallow , so this alternative was considered . However , the recurring high occurrence of fractures in the mountain made this inefficient , so it was also never implemented . 
 Construction of dams upstream : This proposal called for several dams upstream that would " reduce the watershed by 40 percent " , including a dam on Slickrock Creek , a branch of Spring Creek . This plan was implemented , removing the need for the dam enlargement . 
 Waste rock removal : Rock extracted from the mine was removed from tailings piles and disposed of in a compacted cell . In Boulder Creek , another tributary of Spring Creek , the acidity level has lowered slightly .

 In 1985 , it was found that water seepage into the foundations of the Spring Creek Dam could possibly cause its collapse . Shortly after the discovery , a controversy over the irregular spills of mine toxins from the dam began in the 1990s . Two years later , in March 1992 , an uncontrolled , unexpected spill of acidic water rushed from the dam down Spring Creek . This spill heavily contaminated the Keswick Reservoir and threatened the water supply of Redding , California . Despite the fact that the region was suffering from a drought , 77 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 95 @,@ 000 dam3 ) of water were released from Shasta Lake , which was only half full , to dilute the pollution . The loss of the water , which was badly needed by Central Valley agricultural users , was estimated at US $ 18 million . 
 A water treatment plant was built on a site named Minnesota Flats near the Iron Mountain Mine , using lime to balance the pH of the acid mine drainage . Water is also diverted from Slickrock Creek to the treatment site . Altogether , over 95 percent of toxins in the water are removed by the treatment process . Roughly 8 @.@ 5 miles ( 13 @.@ 7 km ) of specialized acid @-@ resistant pipeline , with a cost of over US $ 1 million per mile , are included in the treatment process . Most water flowing directly from the mine has a pH level close to 1 ; the − 3 @.@ 2 pH mentioned earlier is only found in small amounts . Water is further diluted by natural flow in the tributaries and water diverted from nearby Clear Creek , however , the acidic water still requires treatment .

 Spring Creek is a southeast @-@ flowing , 9 @-@ mile ( 14 km ) long tributary of the Sacramento River , receiving water from approximately 16 square miles ( 41 km2 ) of land . The creek begins in the Klamath Mountains above the Sacramento River drainage , and flows in a generally south @-@ east direction before turning south and sharply west into the Spring Creek Reservoir . From the reservoir , it continues due west until it empties directly into an arm of the Keswick Reservoir . The creek never actually runs by the mine . The acid mine drainage found in the creek is actually carried in by two smaller tributaries , which are Boulder Creek and Slickrock Creek . The former stream runs southeast from the north side of Iron Mountain Mine to Spring Creek , while the latter stream drains the south side of the mine and also flows southeast into Spring Creek . South Fork Spring Creek is a small tributary that flows west and north the Spring Creek Reservoir , but since its basin lies far from the mine , it receives no acid mine drainage . The inflow and outflow from the reservoir are highly erratic , ranging from 0 cubic feet ( 0 m3 ) per second to roughly 225 cubic feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m3 ) per second in a particular 10 @-@ day period from March to April . 
 Flat Creek , a small southeast @-@ flowing stream , rises in two forks and empties into the Sacramento River upstream of Spring Creek . The stream receives contaminated runoff from the Minnesota Flats <unk> Pile , but is not nearly as polluted or acidic as Spring Creek . Another stream , Rock Creek , rises in three forks and flows east to meet the Sacramento River downstream of Spring Creek and the Keswick Reservoir .

 The Spring Creek Powerplant is located at the base of the Spring Creek Dam , and is actually supplied by flow from Whiskeytown Lake . The lake , formed by Whiskeytown Dam , is on Clear Creek , a drainage downstream along the Sacramento River from Spring Creek . Both streams run east into the river . The power plant was completed and began operations in 1964 , with a capacity of 150 @,@ 000 kW . The capacity was later upgraded to 180 @,@ 000 kW . The plant is a peaking power plant with two separate generators , generating power for operations and distributing excess power to the local power grid . Water from Whiskeytown Lake is diverted through the Spring Creek Tunnel , a conduit roughly 2 @.@ 4 miles ( 3 @.@ 9 km ) long and 18 @.@ 5 feet ( 5 @.@ 6 m ) in diameter . 
 The Bureau of Reclamation gives a detailed report on the specifications of the generating plant : 
 The powerplant houses two <unk> generators each rated at 100 @,@ 000 kVA , <unk> power factor , along with Francis turbines . Spring Creek Power Conduit conveys water from Whiskeytown Reservoir , located on Clear Creek , to the Spring Creek Powerplant . The Spring Creek power conduit varies in diameter between 5 @.@ 64 metres ( 18 @.@ 5 ft ) and 5 @.@ 18 metres ( 17 @.@ 0 ft ) and is about 4 @.@ 8 km ( 3 @.@ 0 mi ) in length .

 Spring Creek Reservoir is the artificial lake formed behind the dam . The reservoir is used mostly for flood control storage , and is rarely filled to its 5 @,@ 870 acre feet ( 7 @,@ 240 dam3 ) capacity . During the dry season , water from Spring Creek pools in a small , stagnant pond retained behind the dam , depositing contaminated sediment and acidic mine waste in the reservoir space . When flows from the Shasta Dam , upstream on the Sacramento River , are sufficient to flush contaminated water away , water held in the reservoir is released through the outlet works into the Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River . Despite this operation strategy , the reservoir was eventually deemed inadequate for the watershed , and can be filled to capacity by a single heavy storm event . Uncontrollable spills frequently poured into the Sacramento River during floods , through the crest spillway of the dam , which lacks gates . As a result , numerous fish kills have occurred during these sudden releases of contaminants , a major one of which was in 1969 . Due to this consistent acid pollution from the reservoir , most large fish spawn downstream of Red Bluff Diversion Dam , a dam also on the Sacramento River near Red Bluff , California .

 The Spring Creek Dam is able to release up to 5 @,@ 920 cubic feet ( 168 m3 ) of water per second from the Spring Creek Reservoir , through a crest spillway and outlet works . The spillway begins on the left bank of the dam at elevation 795 feet ( 242 m ) , and drops roughly 184 feet ( 56 m ) in vertical distance down the face of the dam into a <unk> basin , before flowing into Spring Creek and into the Sacramento River . It is roughly 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) wide and can carry 5 @,@ 260 cubic feet ( 149 m3 ) per second . The outlet works tunnel through the dam from an elevation much lower than that of the spillway ; the conduit terminates at a culvert exit , a design commonly seen on storm drains but rarely seen on dams , at the base of the dam . The maximum capacity of the outlet works is 660 cubic feet ( 19 m3 ) per second .

 Route 42 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey within the Camden area . It runs 14 @.@ 28 mi ( 22 @.@ 98 km ) from an intersection with U.S. Route 322 and County Route 536 Spur in Monroe Township , Gloucester County to an intersection with Interstate 76 and Interstate 295 in Bellmawr , Camden County . The route is a mix of freeway and divided four @-@ lane arterial road . The southern portion of Route 42 is a local arterial route and one of several highways comprising the Black Horse Pike , a road that runs from Camden to Atlantic City . The northern portion is a six- to eight @-@ lane freeway referred to locally as the North – South Freeway ( or simply the 42 Freeway ) that is directly connected to the Atlantic City Expressway . Major intersections along the route include the Atlantic City Expressway and the southern terminus of Route 168 in Turnersville , another intersection with Route 168 in Blackwood , and Route 41 and Route 55 in Deptford Township . 
 Route 42 was originally designated in 1927 to run along the Black Horse Pike between Ferry Avenue in Camden and the present U.S. Route 40 / U.S. Route 322 split in the McKee City section of Hamilton Township , Atlantic County . In 1953 , the southern terminus was cut back to its current terminus in the Williamstown section of Monroe Township to avoid the concurrency it shared with U.S. Route 322 . After the completion of the North – South Freeway between Bellmawr and Turnersville in 1959 , Route 42 was moved to this freeway , and the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168 . 
 The freeway portion of Route 42 has been improved many times . Construction work has commenced on a project known as the " I @-@ 295 / I @-@ 76 / Route 42 Direct Connection " , which is reconstructing the dangerous and congested Route 42 / Interstate 295 / Interstate 76 interchange in Bellmawr .

 Route 42 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 322 and County Route 536 Spur in Monroe Township , Gloucester County where it heads to the north on the Black Horse Pike . For the first portion of the route , Route 42 is a divided four – lane arterial highway that intersects various local roads . Some intersections along this section feature jughandles . There are also many businesses lining the highway . The route crosses County Route 689 ( Berlin @-@ Cross Keys Road ) and enters Washington Township . It then intersects the northern terminus of County Route 555 ( Tuckahoe Road ) . After the intersection with County Route 555 , Route 42 intersects three more county routes : County Route 655 ( Fries Mill Road ) , County Route 639 ( <unk> Road ) , and County Route 651 ( Greentree Road ) . The Atlantic City Expressway then starts to the right at an unnumbered intersection , Route 168 continues to the north on the Black Horse Pike , and Route 42 becomes the six – lane North – South Freeway . 
 = = = North – South Freeway = = = 
 Upon becoming the North – South Freeway , Route 42 crosses into Gloucester Township , Camden County and comes to the first numbered exit for County Route 705 , which provides access to Route 168 . Following that , the freeway reaches the County Route 673 ( College Drive ) interchange , serving Camden County College and the Gloucester Premium Outlets . County Route 534 interchanges with a southbound exit and northbound entrance and then Coles Road interchanges with a northbound exit and southbound entrance . Next , Route 42 encounters Exits 9B and 10A for Route 168 . Exit 9B serves northbound Route 168 and provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike , and Exit 10A serves southbound Route 168 . County Route 681 interchanges after Route 168 , with a southbound exit and northbound entrance , and Route 42 enters Gloucester County again in Deptford Township after crossing the South Branch of Big Timber Creek . 
 In Deptford Township , Route 41 interchanges with a northbound exit and an entrance in both directions . Past this interchange , County Route 544 interchanges with a southbound exit and an entrance in both directions . Both of these interchanges provide access to the Deptford Mall and , in the case of the Route 41 interchange , to Route 55 from northbound Route 42 since the northbound lanes have no direct access to Route 55 . Route 42 meets the northern terminus of the Route 55 freeway at Exit 13 with a southbound exit and northbound entrance then widens to eight lanes . Route 42 crosses the Big Timber Creek into Runnemede , Camden County , where it passes over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange . The freeway then enters Bellmawr , where it features right @-@ in / right @-@ out ramps with Leaf Avenue , that provide access to County Route 753 ( Creek Road ) . Route 42 then continues north to its terminus at Interstate 295 where the North – South Freeway becomes Interstate 76 , which heads to Camden and Philadelphia . 
 The North – South Freeway portion of Route 42 is a major route for daily commuters from southern New Jersey to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania via the Walt Whitman Bridge and Ben Franklin Bridge and weekend commuters from southeastern Pennsylvania to the southern Jersey Shore via Route 55 and the Atlantic City Expressway . Even though Route 42 ends at I @-@ 295 , the north – south Freeway is sometimes called " Route 42 " all the way to the Interstate 76 / Interstate 676 split . 
 Snow removal , litter control , and landscaping of Route 42 between the end of the Atlantic City Expressway and Interstate 295 is performed by the South Jersey Transportation Authority . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1927 , Route 42 was legislated to run along the Black Horse Pike , a road that traces its origins back to 1855 . In that year , the Camden and <unk> Turnpike Company was established by entrepreneurs who had helped create the White Horse Pike to build a gravel road that would run from Camden south to Blackwoodtown and eventually to Atlantic City , from Ferry Avenue in Camden to Route 48 ( now U.S. Route 40 ) in McKee City . By 1941 , U.S. Route 322 was assigned to follow the routing of Route 42 between Williamstown and McKee City . With the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , which eliminated long concurrencies between U.S. Routes and State Routes , the southern terminus of Route 42 was cut back to Williamstown to avoid the concurrency with U.S. Route 322 . 
 The North – South Freeway portion of Route 42 was originally planned as a parkway in 1932 that would run from the Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City ; however , this proposal never materialized . In the late 1940s , the North – South Freeway was proposed by the New Jersey State Highway Department to run from the Ben Franklin Bridge to Turnersville . In the early 1950s , right @-@ of @-@ way for the freeway was acquired and actual construction of the freeway followed . The Route 42 freeway opened between Interstate 295 in Bellmawr and the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood in 1958 . It opened between the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood and Turnersville in 1959 . With the completion of the North – South Freeway portion of Route 42 , the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168 . 
 Following its completion , the North – South Freeway portion of Route 42 has seen many improvements . In 1965 , the freeway was widened to six lanes for most of its length with the northernmost part being widened to eight lanes due to the completion of the Atlantic City Expressway and development occurring along the route . The route had its interchange with Route 55 open in 1985 , when the Route 55 Freeway was opened from Route 42 to Route 41 to the south . Between 1996 and August 1999 , the route was widened to eight lanes between Interstate 295 and Route 55 in Deptford Township . In the early 2000s , the interchanges with Route 41 and County Route 544 in Deptford were rebuilt at a cost of $ 13 million to improve movements within the area . In October 2003 , the New Jersey Department of Transportation ( NJDOT ) installed exit tabs along the stretch of the freeway portion of Route 42 . On August 27 , 2010 , an interchange opened at County Route 673 ( College Drive ) , providing better access to Camden County College . 
 = = Future = = 
 NJDOT has broken ground on the missing express connection between Interstate 295 and Route 42 to provide an easier connection between the Baltimore @-@ Washington Metropolitan Area and points south to Atlantic City and vice versa . The project , dubbed the I @-@ 295 / I @-@ 76 / Route 42 Direct Connection , will reconstruct the dangerous and congested Route 42 / Interstate 295 / Interstate 76 interchange , which currently requires traffic on I @-@ 295 to use 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) ramps that merge onto the North – South Freeway for a short distance , among a series of other indirect connections . In 2007 , " Alternative D " for the reconstructed interchange was selected , calling for I @-@ 295 to cross over the North – South Freeway . This interchange is projected to cost $ 900 million . Construction began in 2013 and is scheduled to be complete in 2021 . NJDOT has long term plans for 2011 – 2020 to reconstruct the entire Route 42 freeway from the Atlantic City Expressway to I @-@ 295 . 
 On May 12 , 2009 , New Jersey Governor Jon S. Corzine and the Delaware River Port Authority , the agency which manages the PATCO Speedline , announced plans for a Camden @-@ Philadelphia BRT ( bus rapid transit system ) along the Route 42 freeway and the adjacent Route 55 freeway as part of a comprehensive transportation plan for South Jersey that would include a diesel light rail line between Camden and Glassboro , improvements to the Atlantic City Line , and enhanced connections to the Atlantic City International Airport .

 47 Ursae Majoris c ( abbreviated 47 UMa c ) , also named Taphao Kaew ( Thai : <unk> ้ ว , rtgs : Taphaokaeo , pronounced [ <unk> ̂ <unk> ] ) , is an extrasolar planet approximately 46 light @-@ years from Earth in the constellation of Ursa Major . The planet was discovered located in a long @-@ period around the star 47 Ursae Majoris . Its orbit lasts 6 @.@ 55 years and the planet has a mass at least 0 @.@ 540 times that of Jupiter . 
 In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . In December 2015 , the IAU announced the winning name was Taphao Kaew for this planet . The winning name was submitted by the Thai Astronomical Society of Thailand . Taphaokaeo was one of two sisters associated with a Thai folk tale . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 Like the majority of known extrasolar planets , 47 Ursae Majoris c was discovered by detecting changes in its star 's radial velocity caused by the planet 's gravity . This was done by measuring the Doppler shift of the star 's spectrum . 
 At the time of discovery in 2001 , 47 Ursae Majoris was already known to host one extrasolar planet , designated 47 Ursae Majoris b . Further measurements of the radial velocity revealed another periodicity in the data unaccounted for by the first planet . This periodicity could be explained by assuming that a second planet , designated 47 Ursae Majoris c , existed in the system with an orbital period close to 7 years . Observations of the photosphere of 47 Ursae Majoris suggested that the periodicity could not be explained by stellar activity , making the planet interpretation more likely . The planet was announced in 2002 . 
 Further measurements of 47 Ursae Majoris failed to detect the planet , calling its existence into question . Furthermore , it was noted that the data used to determine its existence left the planet 's parameters " almost unconstrained " . A more recent study with datasets spanning over 6 @,@ 900 days came to the conclusion that while the existence of a second planet in the system is likely , periods around 2 @,@ 500 days have high false @-@ alarm probabilities , and gave a best @-@ fit period of 7 @,@ 586 days ( almost 21 years ) . 
 In 2010 , a study was published that determined that there are three giant planets orbiting 47 Ursae Majoris , including one at 2 @,@ 391 days that corresponds well with the original claims for 47 Ursae Majoris c . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Since 47 Ursae Majoris c was detected indirectly , properties such as its radius , composition , and temperature are unknown . Based on its high mass , the planet is likely to be a gas giant with no solid surface . 
 = Pentemont Abbey = 
 Pentemont Abbey ( French : Abbaye de <unk> , or Pentemont , or <unk> , or <unk> ) is a set of 18th and 19th century buildings at the corner of Rue de Grenelle and Rue de Bellechasse in the 7th arrondissement of Paris . The abbey was a Cistercian convent founded near Beauvais in 1217 and moved to its current site in Paris in 1672 at the behest of Louis XIV . A reconstruction of the abbey was initiated in 1745 by the Abbess Marie @-@ Catherine Béthisy de Mézières and work was completed in 1783 . In the late 18th century the abbey was one of the most prestigious educational institutions in Paris for daughters of the elite , including two of Thomas Jefferson 's . The abbey also provided rooms for ladies of good standing who were in search of rest , including Joséphine de Beauharnais when the case of her separation from her first husband was heard . 
 The abbey was disestablished during the French Revolution and the buildings were turned over to military use , first as the home of the National Guard , then the Imperial Guard , and later the Cent @-@ gardes . It continues to be occupied by the Ministère de la Défense with the exception of the former chapel , which since 1844 has been a Protestant church , the Temple <unk> . In August 2014 the Ministry of Defence , facing budget cuts due to austerity policies , sold the buildings to a real estate investment trust , <unk> des <unk> et <unk> <unk> de Paris , with plans to move all ministry offices out of the abbey by the end of October , 2016 .

 Philip of Dreux , the famed crusader bishop of Beauvais , wished to found a convent of the Cistercian order . In 1217 he set aside an orchard southwest of Beauvais , on which were traced out the plans for construction , as well as seven <unk> ( 6 @-@ 7 acres ) of vines . Philip died before the project was completed and his successor , Bishop Milo of Nanteuil , raised the rest of the funds , and it was completed in 1218 . Pope Gregory IX issued a bull from the Lateran Palace on the 8 June 1230 which sanctioned the new abbey and declared the funds raised for its endowment protected . The abbey took its name , meaning mountain slope , from its location at the foot of the Montagne de St @-@ Symphorien . 
 In 1554 the abbey provided refuge to Charlotte I de <unk> , the abbess of the neighboring Abbey of Saint @-@ Paul , whose election as abbess was opposed by Henry II . She fled to Pentemont after the arrival of the king 's soldiers at her own abbey . However , they followed her to Pentemont and demanded by force that she renounce her position , a request to which she was compelled to accede . 
 In 1671 , after the abbey was damaged in a flood , and for economic and geographical reasons , the abbess Hélène de Tourville moved the abbey to Paris . At the time , the convent had twelve sisters . The previous building was demolished and returned to agricultural work as part of the Pentemont farm . 
 = = = Paris ( 1672 – 1790 ) = = = 
 In Paris the abbey took up residence in a former convent , recently suppressed , of the Sisters of the Incarnate Word , located on Rue de Grenelle at the current site of the abbey . The sisters dedicated themselves to the education of young women and later added rooms in which women of good standing could find rest . The abbey quickly acquired a distinguished reputation and by the time of its dissolution in 1790 had revenues of 58 @,@ 000 livres , a great sum for the era . 
 The final abbess , Marie III Catherine de Béthisy de Mézières , spent 45 years and a great deal of money rebuilding and expanding the abbey . A competition for plans for a reconstruction attracted multiple proposals including one from the royal architect , François II <unk> , which drew praise from Denis Diderot in the Encyclopédie for its combination of grandeur and simplicity . The winning proposal , however , was from Pierre <unk> d 'Ivry . 
 The many famous students educated at the abbey included the noted abbess and princess Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon , and Louise d <unk> de Lussan , the mistress of the Count of Artois , the future Charles X of France . Thomas Jefferson 's daughters Martha and Mary were both educated at the Pentemont Abbey while he was Minister to France . Their entry into the school was sponsored by the wife of the Marquis de Lafayette . The future first lady Abigail Adams was shocked that Jefferson would send his girls to a Catholic school but he assured her that there were many Protestants at the abbey . Conditions were austere for the students , despite the presence of three princesses , with no fires until the water froze and a prohibition on speaking outside of class and recreation . Her time at the school led Martha , nicknamed Patsy , to write a letter to her father expressing her desire to become a nun . Jefferson quickly removed his daughters from the care of the convent . 
 The abbey also provided elegant apartments to highborn women seeking independence from families or difficult marriages . The ladies were free to come and go as they liked , with constraints on the hours allowed outside the convent , often had their children and servants with them , and spent their evenings socializing and <unk> in the abbey 's salons . One such resident was Joséphine de Beauharnais , the future Empress of France , during her separation from her first husband , Alexandre de Beauharnais . The court granted her temporary independence from her husband and required her to stay at Pentemont with her children at the expense of Alexandre . It is also speculated that James Smithson , the founder of the Smithsonian Institution , who was born in Paris the illegitimate son of the Duke of Northumberland , was born in the Pentemont Abbey , as it had strong connections to the Duke , whose illegitimate daughters it educated .

 During the French Revolution , the Abbey was suppressed and its properties confiscated . The abbey 's affairs were wound down in 1791 @-@ 2 , with its properties in Beauvais sold to pay off state debt . With the abbey now state property it came to serve first as home to the National Guard , then the Imperial Guard . In 1835 , the building was expanded to Rue de Bellechasse which required the demolition of some parts of the original structure . Under the Second Empire the abbey served as the barracks of the Cent @-@ gardes Squadron , an elite cavalry unit that provided personal protection for Napoleon III and the Tuileries Palace . 
 In the twentieth century , Pentemont Abbey housed the Ministry of War Pensions , Bonuses and Benefits . In 1937 , a bunker was constructed underneath the Court of Honor including two stationary bicycles intended to provide electricity in case of power loss due to enemy bombardment . The courtyard has a war memorial that reads " From veterans to their comrades who gave their lives for their country . In memoriam . " It is also home to a number of commemorative plaques , including ones for André Maginot and Henri <unk> . 
 = = = = Protestant Church = = = = 
 The chapel was used to store grain during the Revolution and later hay when the army took over the abbey . After the Concordat of 1801 provided formal recognition of the Reformed Church in France , it was decided that three former Catholic churches in Paris be turned over to Reformed congregations , Saint @-@ Louis @-@ du @-@ Louvre , Sainte @-@ Marie @-@ des @-@ Anges , and the chapel of the Pentemont Abbey . 
 In 1598 , Protestant worship had been forbidden in Paris by the Edict of Nantes . In 1685 , the Edict of Fontainebleau made non @-@ Catholic services illegal in all of France . This inaugurated a long period of persecution for French Protestants though some in Paris were able to worship in the chapels of the Dutch and Swedish embassies . The handover of the chapel of the abbey as well as the other churches ushered in a new era of open Protestant worship in Paris . 
 The actual opening of the former abbey as a Reformed congregation was delayed by decades of bureaucratic obstacles as well as opposition during the Bourbon Restoration to turning over a former Catholic building to Protestant use . It was not until 1844 that architect Victor <unk> began work to convert the chapel into a Protestant church . He isolated the chapel from the rest of the building , added new doors in place of two of the previous windows , and converted the former choir to a nave . He also closed off the original entrance by adding a massive organ , built by Aristide Cavaillé @-@ Coll and installed in 1846 for the opening of the church . The organ has undergone various modifications over the years including a restoration from 2011 @-@ 14 to restore the remaining original elements . The church itself underwent restoration from 2005 @-@ 2007 commissioned by the City of Paris and accomplished by Benjamin Mouton , the chief architect of historic monuments , and the firm Aubert @-@ <unk> .

 Dyspanopeus sayi is a species of mud crab that is native to the Atlantic coast of North America . It has also become established outside its native range , living in Swansea Docks since 1960 , the Mediterranean Sea since the 1970s , the North Sea since 2007 and the Black Sea since 2010 . It can reach a carapace width of 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) , and has black tips to its unequal claws . It feeds on bivalves and barnacles , and is in turn eaten by predators including the Atlantic blue crab , Callinectes sapidus . Eggs are produced from spring to autumn , the offspring reach sexual maturity the following summer , and individuals can live for up to two years . The closest relative of D. sayi is D. texanus , which lives in the Gulf of Mexico ; the two species differ in subtle features of the genitalia and the last pair of walking legs .

 Dyspanopeus sayi is a small crab , similar in appearance to <unk> <unk> . It reaches a maximum carapace width of 20 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) , with sexually mature females having a carapace 6 @.@ 1 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) or more across . The carapace is roughly hexagonal , about 1 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 4 times as wide as long and strongly convex . It has a finely granular surface , and has a light covering of hair , especially towards the front and sides . The chelae ( claws ) are unequal : the right claw is stouter , and the left claw is narrower . The carapace is olive @-@ green to brown , but the tips of the claws are black .

 The natural range of D. sayi extends from the Baie des <unk> ( eastern Canada ) to the Florida Keys ( south @-@ eastern United States ) , where it lives from the intertidal zone down to depths of 46 metres ( 151 ft ) . It tolerates a wide range of temperatures and salinities . 
 D. sayi has also been recorded from a number of locations in Europe . The first sighting was in Swansea Docks , South Wales ( United Kingdom ) in 1960 , and the scientist who reported it , E. Naylor , believed there was " no doubt " that the species had arrived through trans @-@ Atlantic shipping . The first record from the Mediterranean Sea was made in 1993 , when the species was discovered in the Venetian Lagoon ( north @-@ eastern Italy ) , although it is thought to have been living there since the late 1970s . In 2007 , D. sayi was recorded from the North Sea coast of the Netherlands . It was discovered in the Black Sea in 2010 , living in Constanța harbour ( Romania ) , and in the Ebro delta of the Balearic Sea ( western Mediterranean Sea ) in 2012 . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Dyspanopeus sayi lives predominantly on muddy bottoms , where it is a predator of bivalve molluscs . In its native environment , it hides among colonies of polychaetes to avoid being preyed on by the Atlantic blue crab , Callinectes sapidus . It is an important predator of the quahog , Mercenaria mercenaria , in Narragansett Bay , and of the barnacle Balanus <unk> in Delaware Bay . In the Adriatic Sea , it has been observed to feed on the striped <unk> clam , Chamelea <unk> , and the introduced Asian date mussel , <unk> <unk> . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 The life cycle of D. sayi begins with copulation , which normally takes place shortly after the female has moulted , while her exoskeleton is still soft . Spawning occurs within hours or days of copulation , and the eggs are brooded on the female 's pleopods ( <unk> ) until they are ready to hatch . Females have been found carrying eggs from April to October ; in a study of crabs caught at Gloucester Point , Virginia in 1978 , females were observed to carry between 686 and 14 @,@ 735 eggs . The number of eggs increases with carapace width according to a power law ; extrapolation of the power law suggests that the largest D. sayi females are capable of carrying over 32 @,@ 000 eggs each . 
 At 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) , the eggs can take only 9 or 10 days to develop , and this increases to 16 days at temperatures of 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) . The young crabs hatch as zoea larvae , and pass through three further <unk> stages and one megalopa before becoming juveniles . Juveniles are thought to reach maturity in the summer after they hatch . The total lifespan of an individual can be up to 2 years . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species had been noticed by the American zoologist Thomas Say , and formed part of the species he called " Cancer <unk> " – a junior homonym of " Cancer <unk> " Herbst , 1801 , which is itself a junior synonym of <unk> scaber ( Fabricius , 1798 ) . In 1869 , Sidney Irving Smith described seven new species in the genus Panopeus , including " P. sayi " , in addition to the twelve species already placed in the genus at that time . Common names for the species include " Say 's mud crab " and " Say mud crab " . 
 Smith noted the similarity of the species to " Panopeus texanus " , which had been described ten years earlier by William Stimpson , and Smith considered that the two might be the same species . In 1880 , John Sterling Kingsley and Alphonse Milne @-@ Edwards independently synonymised " P. sayi " with " P. texana " , which remained until Mary J. Rathbun moved both taxa to the genus <unk> and re @-@ established Smith 's taxon as a subspecies of " N. texana " . She argued that the two taxa should be considered subspecies , as hybrids between them occurred , although the specimens she saw are now thought to be D. sayi . 
 In 1972 , Lawrence G. Abele re @-@ examined " N. texanus texanus " , " N. texanus sayi " and N. <unk> , and concluded that they were all good species , and so re @-@ elevated " N. sayi " to the rank of species . In 1986 , Joel W. Martin and Abele placed N. texanus and N. sayi in a separate genus , Dyspanopeus , reaffirming their close relationship . However , P. texana only occurs in the Gulf of Mexico , and can be distinguished from P. sayi by the form of the fifth pereiopod ( last walking leg ) and that of the male gonopod .

They can make good family dogs and are patient with children , but can require some sort of purpose , be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive . 
 = = History = = 
 The Field Spaniel was originally developed for the show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all @-@ black Spaniel . Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised ; one of the first breeders of the Field Spaniel , Thomas Jacobs , said of the origin ; " Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed ; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type , and frequent missiles have at me and my dogs from behind the hedge . But where is the pure bred black spaniel we hear so much about ? Proof of the existence of the pure bred one ( if there ever was one ! ) has not been forthcoming . Like most sporting dogs , they are the result of different crosses . " 
 They were unpopular with sportsmen as the dark colours of the breed did not show up in hunting conditions , and the elongated and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover . The low @-@ slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett , the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show . Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels . Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel . In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel ; however , it resulted in a dog that was almost exactly like a Sussex Spaniel with the exception of the head itself . 
 The dog who is considered to be the father of the modern English Cocker Spaniel is Ch . Obo , who was born in 1879 to a Sussex Spaniel father and a Field Spaniel mother . Obo 's son Ch . Obo II is considered to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel , who was described as being only ten inches high with quite a long body . 
 By 1909 , the average weight of a Field Spaniel was 35 – 45 pounds ( 16 – 20 kg ) . Further mixing of the breed occurred with elements of the Basset Hound introduced . Various genetic health issues arose and action was taken in order to correct the problems within the breed . English Springer Spaniels were used to introduce healthier elements into the breed and resulted in the longer legged spaniel that we know today . Most of the modern breed can be traced to four dogs from the 1950s ; Colombina of <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> Teal , and Ronayne Regal . 
 The Field Spaniel remains a rare breed , even in the UK . In 2009 , a total of 51 dogs were registered with The Kennel Club and has been in steady decline since 2000 . Out of all the Spaniel breeds registered with The Kennel Club , the Field Spaniel has the lowest numbered registered year on year , with only the Sussex Spaniel coming a close second with 60 registrations in 2009 . This is compared to the English Springer Spaniel with 12 @,@ 700 and the English Cocker Spaniel with 22 @,@ 211 registrations in 2009 alone . In order to promote the breed , they have been registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club .

 The standard size for a Field Spaniel is 17 – 18 inches ( 43 – 46 cm ) tall at the withers , and a weight of between 40 – 55 pounds ( 18 – 25 kg ) . This places it roughly between the English Cocker Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel in size . Its long , silky coat comes in solid colours of black , liver , or roan . Tan points , white markings on the throat and the chest can be ticked or the same colour as the rest of the body . 
 They have a moderately long single coat with no undercoat . <unk> of the fur appears on the chest , belly , ears and on the back of the legs . The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur . Docked tails were often used in working dogs , as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult . 
 = = = Temperament = = = 
 The Field Spaniel can be a good family dog while it has a job to do . They are suitable for dog agility and hunting . Without some sort of purpose , the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief . However , they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family . When socialised , they are good with other dogs . They are generally docile and independent , and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels . Stanley Coren 's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence . 
 = = Health = = 
 There are a few ocular conditions to which the Field Spaniel has a predisposition . These include cataracts , retinal atrophy and retinal dysplasia . Hip dysplasia has appeared in British lines of Field Spaniels . In a health survey conducted by the Kennel Club ( UK ) , the primary cause of death in Field Spaniels was cancer , with the second most frequent cause being old age . The median lifespan for the breed was found to be eleven years and eight months , which is five months higher than the median age for all dog breeds . 
 = Scandium = 
 Scandium is a chemical element with symbol Sc and atomic number 21 . A silvery @-@ white metallic d @-@ block element , it has historically been sometimes classified as a rare earth element , together with yttrium and the <unk> . It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia . 
 Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare earth and uranium compounds , but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide . Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium , which was first done in 1937 , applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s . The positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered in the 1970s , and its use in such alloys remains its only major application . The global trade of scandium oxide is about 10 tonnes per year . 
 The properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium . A diagonal relationship exists between the behavior of magnesium and scandium , just as there is between beryllium and aluminium . In the chemical compounds of the elements in group 3 , the predominant oxidation state is + 3 . 
 = = Properties = = 
 = = = Chemical characteristics of the element = = = 
 Scandium is a soft metal with a silvery appearance . It develops a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air . It is susceptible to weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids . It does not react with a 1 : 1 mixture of nitric acid ( HNO3 ) and 48 % hydrofluoric acid ( HF ) , possibly due to the formation of an impermeable passive layer . Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium ( III ) oxide . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 In nature , scandium is found exclusively as the isotope 45Sc , which has a nuclear spin of 7 / 2 . Thirteen radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being <unk> , which has a half @-@ life of 83 @.@ 8 days ; <unk> , 3 @.@ 35 days ; the positron emitter <unk> , 4 h ; and <unk> , 43 @.@ 7 hours . All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives less than 4 hours , and the majority of these have half @-@ lives less than 2 minutes . This element also has five meta states , with the most stable being <unk> ( t1 / 2 = 58 @.@ 6 h ) . 
 The isotopes of scandium range from <unk> to <unk> . The primary decay mode at masses lower than the only stable isotope , 45Sc , is electron capture , and the primary mode at masses above it is beta emission . The primary decay products at atomic weights below 45Sc are calcium isotopes and the primary products from higher atomic weights are titanium isotopes . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 In Earth 's crust , scandium is not rare . Estimates vary from 18 to 25 ppm , which is comparable to the abundance of cobalt ( 20 – 30 ppm ) . Scandium is only the 50th most common element on Earth ( 35th most abundant in the crust ) , but it is the 23rd most common element in the Sun . However , scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals . Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite , euxenite , and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element . <unk> can contain up to 45 % of scandium in the form of scandium ( III ) oxide . 
 The stable form of scandium is created in supernovas via the r @-@ process . 
 = = Production = = 
 The world production of scandium is in the order of 10 tonnes per year , in the form of scandium oxide . The demand is about 50 % higher , and both the production and demand keep increasing . In 2003 , only three mines produced scandium : the uranium and iron mines in Zhovti Vody in Ukraine , the rare earth mines in Bayan Obo , China , and the apatite mines in the Kola peninsula , Russia ; since then many other countries have built scandium @-@ producing facilities . In each case scandium is a byproduct from the extraction of other elements and is sold as scandium oxide . 
 To produce metallic scandium , the oxide is converted to scandium fluoride and reduced with metallic calcium . 
 Madagascar and <unk> @-@ <unk> region in Norway have the only deposits of minerals with high scandium content , thortveitite ( Sc , Y ) 2 ( <unk> ) and <unk> <unk> · 2H2O , but these are not being exploited . 
 The absence of reliable , secure , stable , and long term production has limited commercial applications of scandium . Despite this low level of use , scandium offers significant benefits . Particularly promising is the strengthening of aluminium alloys with as little as 0 @.@ 5 % scandium . Scandium @-@ stabilized zirconia enjoys a growing market demand for use as a high efficiency electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells . 
 = = Compounds = = 
 Scandium chemistry is almost completely dominated by the trivalent ion , <unk> + . The radii of M3 + ions in the table below indicate that the chemical properties of scandium ions have more in common with yttrium ions than with aluminium ions . In part because of this similarity , scandium is often classified as a lanthanide @-@ like element . 
 = = = Oxides and hydroxides = = = 
 The oxide Sc2O3 and the hydroxide Sc ( OH ) 3 are amphoteric : 
 Sc ( OH ) 3 + 3 OH − → Sc ( OH ) 3 − 
 6 
 Sc ( OH ) 3 + 3 H + + 3 H2O → [ Sc ( H2O ) 6 ] 3 + 
 The α- and γ- forms of scandium oxide hydroxide ( <unk> ( OH ) ) , are isostructural with their aluminium oxide hydroxide counterparts . Solutions of <unk> + in water are acidic because of hydrolysis . 
 = = = Halides and pseudohalides = = = 
 The halides , <unk> , are very soluble in water where X = Cl , Br , or I , but ScF3 is insoluble . In all four halides , the scandium is 6 @-@ coordinated . The halides are Lewis acids ; for example , ScF3 dissolves in a solution containing excess fluoride ion to form [ <unk> ] 3 − . The coordination number 6 is typical of Sc ( III ) . In the larger Y3 + and La3 + ions , coordination numbers of 8 and 9 are common . Scandium ( III ) triflate is sometimes used as a Lewis acid catalyst in organic chemistry . 
 = = = Organic derivatives = = = 
 Scandium forms a series of organometallic compounds with cyclopentadienyl ligands ( Cp ) , similar to the behavior of the lanthanides . One example is the chlorine @-@ bridged dimer , [ <unk> ] 2 and related derivatives of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands . 
 = = = Uncommon oxidation states = = = 
 Compounds that feature scandium in the oxidation state other than + 3 are rare but well characterized . The blue @-@ black compound <unk> is one of the simplest . This material adopts a sheet @-@ like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium ( II ) centers . Scandium hydride is not well understood , although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc ( II ) . As is observed for most elements , a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase . Scandium borides and carbides are non @-@ stoichiometric , as is typical for neighboring elements . 
 Lower oxidation states ( + 2 , + 1 , 0 ) have also been observed in <unk> compounds . 
 = = History = = 
 Dmitri Mendeleev , who is referred to as the father of the periodic table , predicted the existence of an element <unk> , with an atomic mass between 40 and 48 in 1869 . Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team detected this element in the minerals euxenite and gadolinite . Nilson prepared 2 grams of scandium oxide of high purity . He named the element scandium , from the Latin Scandia meaning " Scandinavia " . Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev 's prediction , but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev . 
 Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of potassium , lithium , and scandium chlorides , at 700 – 800 ° C. The first pound of 99 % pure scandium metal was produced in 1960 . Production of aluminium alloys began in 1971 , following a US patent . Aluminium @-@ scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR . 
 Laser crystals of gadolinium @-@ scandium @-@ gallium garnet ( <unk> ) were used in strategic defense applications developed for the Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) in the 1980s and 1990s . 
 = = Applications = = 
 The addition of scandium to aluminium limits the grain growth in the heat zone of welded aluminium components . This has two beneficial effects : the precipitated <unk> forms smaller crystals than in other aluminium alloys , and the volume of precipitate @-@ free zones at the grain boundaries of age @-@ hardening aluminium alloys is reduced . Both of these effects increase the usefulness of the alloy . However , titanium alloys , which are similar in lightness and strength , are cheaper and much more widely used . 
 The alloy <unk> is as strong as titanium , light as aluminium , and hard as ceramic . 
 The main application of scandium by weight is in aluminium @-@ scandium alloys for minor aerospace industry components . These alloys contain between 0 @.@ 1 % and 0 @.@ 5 % of scandium . They were used in the Russian military aircraft , specifically the MiG @-@ 21 and MiG @-@ 29 . 
 Some items of sports equipment , which rely on high performance materials , have been made with scandium @-@ aluminium alloys , including baseball bats and bicycle frames and components . Lacrosse sticks are also made with scandium . The American firearm manufacturing company , Smith & Wesson , produces revolvers with frames of scandium alloy and cylinders of titanium or carbon steel . 
 Dentists use erbium , chromium : yttrium @-@ scandium @-@ gallium garnet ( Er , Cr : <unk> ) lasers for cavity preparation and in <unk> . 
 The first scandium @-@ based metal halide lamps were patented by General Electric and initially made in North America , although they are now produced in all major industrialized countries . Approximately 20 kg ( as Sc2O3 ) of scandium is used annually in the United States for high @-@ intensity discharge lamps . One type of metal halide lamp , similar to the mercury @-@ vapor lamp , is made from Scandium iodide and sodium iodide . This lamp is a white light source with high color rendering index that sufficiently resembles sunlight to allow good color @-@ reproduction with TV cameras . About 80 kg of scandium is used in metal halide lamps / light bulbs globally per year . 
 The radioactive isotope <unk> is used in oil refineries as a tracing agent . Scandium triflate is a catalytic Lewis acid used in organic chemistry . 
 = = Health and safety = = 
 Elemental scandium is considered non @-@ toxic , though extensive animal testing of scandium compounds has not been done . The median lethal dose ( LD50 ) levels for scandium ( III ) chloride for rats have been determined as 4 mg / kg for intraperitoneal and 755 mg / kg for oral administration . In the light of these results compounds of scandium should be handled as compounds of moderate toxicity . 
 = Interstate 70 in Utah = 
 Interstate 70 ( I @-@ 70 ) is a mainline route of the Interstate Highway System in the United States connecting Utah and Maryland . The Utah section runs east – west for 232 @.@ 15 miles ( 373 @.@ 61 km ) across the central part of the state . Richfield is the largest Utah city served by the freeway , which does not serve or connect any urban areas in the state . The freeway was built as part of a system of highways connecting Los Angeles and the northeastern United States . I @-@ 70 was the second attempt to connect southern California to the east coast of the United States via central Utah , the first being a failed attempt to construct a transcontinental railroad . Parts of that effort were re @-@ used in the laying out of the route of I @-@ 70 . 
 Unlike most Interstate Highways , much of I @-@ 70 in Utah was not constructed parallel to or on top of an existing U.S. Highway . Portions of I @-@ 70 were constructed in areas where previously there were no paved roads . Because it was built over an entirely new route , I @-@ 70 has many features that are unique in the Interstate Highway System . For example , the 110 miles ( 177 km ) between Green River and Salina makes up the longest distance anywhere in the Interstate Highway System with no motorist services . This same piece is noted as the longest highway in the United States built over a completely new route since the Alaska Highway , and the longest piece of Interstate Highway to open at a given time . The construction of the Utah portion of I @-@ 70 is listed as one of the engineering marvels of the Interstate Highway System . 
 The choice of the route had a significant impact on the character and culture of the Sevier Valley . It has also been a motivating factor for environmentalists to create a new National Park along the path of the highway to protect scenic areas around the route . I @-@ 70 from Green River to Grand Junction , Colorado is part of the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway , making I @-@ 70 one of the few Interstate Highways to be named a National Scenic Byway . Attractions listed by the Federal Highway Administration for the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway on or near I @-@ 70 include , Arches National Park , Canyonlands National Park , Cleveland @-@ Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry , Goblin Valley State Park and Westwater . The designation lists several side roads branching from I @-@ 70 that lead to dinosaur bones or footprints . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 70 begins at a trumpet interchange with Interstate 15 , near Cove Fort . It then proceeds east over the Pavant Range , cresting at an unnamed summit with an elevation of 7 @,@ 076 feet ( 2 @,@ 157 m ) . The eastern descent from the Pavant range features bridges high above Clear Creek and its side canyons . The longest of these bridges is the Fish Creek bridge at 1 @,@ 180 feet ( 360 m ) long . The descent into Clear Creek features a brake check area and runaway truck ramp to aid truckers down the steep slope . The freeway then skirts the edge of Fremont Indian State Park before entering Sevier Valley . 
 = = = Sevier Valley = = = 
 I @-@ 70 serves as the main thoroughfare of the valley , the only area traversed by the freeway in the state with more than a few hundred residents . Richfield is the largest city along I @-@ 70 in the state . The highway enters the valley just north of Big Rock Candy Mountain , a mountain named for a song attributed to Harry McClintock . The highway proceeds northeast along the western edge of the valley , passing to the west of the communities of the valley , including Joseph , Monroe , Elsinore , and Richfield . As I @-@ 70 approaches Salina it cuts across the valley passing to the south of that town . The highway avoids the downtown areas of all of these cities . The portion between Richfield and Salina is the busiest , with an annual average daily traffic of 11 @,@ 535 vehicles in 2006 . In the Sevier Valley , I @-@ 70 was built parallel to U.S. Route 89 . 
 = = = Wasatch Plateau = = = 
 At Salina , US @-@ 50 joins I @-@ 70 , and the two highways run concurrent for the rest of the way through Utah . After leaving Salina I @-@ 70 departs on a 110 @-@ mile ( 177 km ) course to Green River . This is the longest distance in the Interstate Highway System with no motorist services . The route to Green River crosses two major geographic obstacles , the Wasatch Plateau and the San Rafael Swell . 
 I @-@ 70 ascends the Wasatch Plateau via Salina Canyon . The top of the canyon is the highest point of any of Utah 's Interstate Highways , although the elevation differs from source to source . The Utah Department of Transportation ( UDOT ) has listed the elevation at 7 @,@ 923 feet ( 2 @,@ 415 m ) and 7 @,@ 886 feet ( 2 @,@ 404 m ) . Other maps have listed the figure 7 @,@ 980 feet ( 2 @,@ 432 m ) . At least one map has given this point a name , Emigrant Pass . This portion of I @-@ 70 is on protected lands as part of Fishlake National Forest . The freeway exits the Wasatch Plateau at Fremont Junction , the name of the junction of I @-@ 70 with State Route 10 . 
 = = = San Rafael Swell = = = 
 Between Fremont Junction and the junction of SR @-@ 24 near Green River , Interstate 70 crosses a geologic feature called the San Rafael Swell . The construction of the freeway through the swell is listed as one of the engineering marvels of the Interstate Highway System , with one engineer claiming this section as " one of the most significant highway construction feats of its time " . The construction of I @-@ 70 through the swell required boring through many solid rock canyons , cliffs , and mountains . The swell is noted for its sheer canyons and rock formations and is home to a large amount of exposed dinosaur remains . This includes the largest known collection of Jurassic period dinosaur remains at the Cleveland @-@ Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry at the north end of the swell . 
 The highway ascends the western edge of the swell on a steady slope loosely following the north rim of Devils Canyon . At the top of the grade is a view area with a view of Devils Canyon and an overlook of the country west of the swell . It then crosses Eagle Canyon via a pair of steel arch bridges . The eastbound bridge is 489 feet ( 149 m ) long and the westbound bridge is 523 feet ( 159 m ) long . 
 The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit , the highest point for I @-@ 70 inside the swell . At the summit is another view area overlooking the Little Grand Canyon of the San Rafael River . The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby . The Ghost Rocks themselves are at 7 @,@ 405 feet ( 2 @,@ 257 m ) , although the freeway is slightly lower . I @-@ 70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon , which provides the exit route to the swell . The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down . About halfway down is a view area of the canyon narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of the swell , the San Rafael Reef . Just as the highway exits the swell it passes to the north of Goblin Valley State Park . The highway exits the swell near Green River . 
 = = = Book Cliffs = = = 
 West of Green River , US @-@ 6 and 191 join I @-@ 70 . Also at Green River , the freeway reaches the southern edge of the Book Cliffs , a mountain range which I @-@ 70 follows to Grand Junction , Colorado . This portion of I @-@ 70 is part of the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway , recognized as a scenic byway by both the National Scenic Byways and Utah Scenic Byways programs . Listed attractions along the byway in the Green River area include Crystal Geyser , Capitol Reef National Park and Green River State Park . 
 From this point east the freeway is routed across a flat area between the Book Cliffs and the Colorado River , called Sagers Flat . Along the way it passes by the towns of Crescent Junction , Thompson Springs and Cisco . Natural features visible from this portion include Arches National Park and Castle Valley . Other listed attractions along the byway near this section include Canyonlands National Park and various areas with Morrison Formation , a layer of rock where dinosaur remains are common . I @-@ 70 , US @-@ 6 , and US @-@ 50 all enter Colorado concurrently . Where I @-@ 70 follows the Book Cliffs , it was built parallel to or on top of US @-@ 6 / 50 .

 The first route through this portion of Utah was the Old Spanish Trail , a trade route between Santa Fe , New Mexico and Los Angeles , California . The trail was in common use before the Mexican @-@ American War in 1848 . Although the trail serves a different route than I @-@ 70 , they were both intended to connect southern California with points further east . I @-@ 70 generally parallels the route of the Old Spanish Trail west of Crescent Junction . I @-@ 15 south of the junction with I @-@ 70 also generally parallels the trail . 
 = = = Transcontinental railroads = = = 
 The first attempt to build a modern trade route through the area is credited to William Jackson Palmer , founder of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad ( D & RG ) . Palmer started a project in 1880 to make what had been a local railroad from Colorado into a transcontinental railroad empire . This would mean a second transcontinental railroad would be built across Utah . This would also place the D & RG in competition with the First Transcontinental Railroad , then operated by Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad . 
 Disagreements in the company led to two proposals . Both proposals called for extending the railroad west from Colorado as far as what is now Green River . West of Green River a " northern route " would extend the railroad towards Ogden , Utah , there connecting with the established Overland Route . This proposal was eventually completed as the Utah Division , loosely following the route of modern U.S. Route 6 across eastern Utah . This line soon became the main line of the D & RG and remains one of the main transcontinental rail arteries of the U.S , now operated by the Union Pacific Railroad as the Central Corridor . 
 The second proposal was a " southern route " that would continue due west from Green River and head towards Los Angeles , similar to the route of modern I @-@ 70 . This proposal would require extending the railroad farther west , to connect with what would become the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad . 
 Due to disagreements in management and poor communication , construction began on both routes . It was soon obvious that the southern route was unfeasible given the remote area , technology available at the time and the rough terrain of the San Rafael Swell . The D & RG spent $ 217 @,@ 470 ( 1883 , equivalent to $ 4 @.@ 6 million in 2007 ) on the project before declaring it a failure . One of the accounts in the book Utah Ghost Rails states the railroad fired the lead surveyor , even though the workers had graded a path past the San Rafael Reef . This route today is a jeep trail . According to a sign placed by the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) , had the southern route succeeded it would have been the shortest transcontinental railroad in the U.S. 
 Construction resumed in 1901 on a portion of the southern route , to build a spur line to service coal mines on the Wasatch Plateau . The railroad branched from an existing line at Salina and traveled east up Salina Canyon . After the mines closed , the railroad bed was used to improve State Route 10 , between Salina and Fremont Junction . I @-@ 70 would later use the railroad bed for a path across the Wasatch Plateau . 
 = = = Plans for Interstate 70 = = = 
 By the time the Interstate Highway System was in the planning stages , no paved road had yet entered the San Rafael Swell . The established highway through the area was US @-@ 6 / US @-@ 50 which , like the railroad , entered Utah from Colorado and turned north around the swell . 
 As first proposed in 1956 , the western terminus of I @-@ 70 was Denver , Colorado . Officials from Colorado pressured the federal government to extend the plans for I @-@ 70 further west . After several discussions with Utah officials , Utah supported an extension that would follow US @-@ 6 / 50 ( now US @-@ 6 ) , to connect with I @-@ 15 at Spanish Fork . This proposal would connect the Salt Lake City area with Denver . While accepting the Colorado / Utah proposal , federal planners also decided to show a modified proposal , with the terminus of I @-@ 70 at Cove Fort , to planners at the Department of the Army . The planners opposed the extension to Salt Lake , but felt the modified proposal would benefit the U.S. Army , by providing a better connection to southern California . The new route would shorten the distance between Los Angeles and Denver by about 200 miles ( 320 km ) . The route to Cove Fort was approved on October 18 , 1957 . A general announcement was made , with no prior notice given to Utah officials of the modification . The commissioner of the Bureau of Public Roads later admitted that the lack of notice was intentional , fearing infighting if the bureau did not announce a final decision . 
 A state historian stated the news hit Utah " like a bombshell " . Except for the officials in Utah that represented the area , most opposed a freeway that would serve no populated areas in the state . The route was mocked as a public relations blunder and a " road to nowhere " . Utah officials attempted to revert plans to their preferred alternative , but later resigned to construct I @-@ 70 on the federally selected route . Governor George Dewey Clyde concluded , " Utah had no choice but to accept the Cove Fort routing , or have none at all . " Even attempts to route the freeway slightly north , to serve more cities in Emery County , were blocked . Federal planners insisted the freeway pass Green River on a southwest course and not turn north . Even today , there is no direct interstate link between Salt Lake and Denver . Motorists must choose between the two lane routes ( US @-@ 6 or US @-@ 40 ) or detour on I @-@ 80 through Wyoming . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 With the plans for I @-@ 70 extended , a transcontinental route would again be attempted across the San Rafael Swell . The area west of Green River was so remote that survey crews followed wild horses with jeeps to survey parts of the route . According to a story told at the highway 's dedication , by an engineer who surveyed the highway , his group was approached by a sheep rancher and asked what they were doing . The rancher fell over laughing when he was told they were building a freeway . 
 The survey crew did not use the route of the railroad past the San Rafael Reef . However , they did use the route of the railroad across the Wasatch Plateau . The construction crews destroyed two of four tunnels when the bed was widened for the freeway . The two remaining tunnels are visible just south of the freeway and are used by a frontage road . 
 Some portions of I @-@ 70 over the Pavant Range and Wasatch Plateau were opened to traffic before the portion over the San Rafael Swell . These portions were temporarily signed as State Route 4 . The portion over the San Rafael Swell opened to traffic in 1970 , finally making the Utah portion of I @-@ 70 a drivable route . 
 Interstate 70 was dedicated on December 5 , 1970 , at the Ghost Rocks view area inside the swell , even though it would take another 20 years to fully complete the freeway . At the ceremony the mayors of cities recently made neighbors , including Grand Junction , Colorado , introduced themselves . Then Governor Calvin L. Rampton noted that I @-@ 70 was the longest road the U.S. had built over a completely new route since the Alaska Highway , during World War II . It was also noted this was the longest piece of the Interstate Highway System to open at a given time . 
 Initially only two lanes , now the eastbound lanes , through the swell were constructed . The official highway map for Utah noted the new freeway , but qualified its existence with the words " two lanes open " . The first portions of I @-@ 70 to be constructed to Interstate Highway standards were along the non @-@ disputed portion of the route east of Green River . 
 The Utah portion of I @-@ 70 was not completed to Interstate Highway standards until 1990 , when the second Eagle Canyon bridge was dedicated . A second dedication ceremony was held at the bridge declaring the Utah portion of I @-@ 70 complete . Archie Hamilton , one of three engineers who worked for Utah Department of Transportation ( UDOT ) long enough to see I @-@ 70 progress from conception to completion , said the most memorable moment was seeing the excavation at Spotted Wolf Canyon . He said before construction began , he could stand in one spot and touch both sides of the canyon . To carve the first 8 miles ( 13 km ) through the canyon required excavating 3 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 2 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 m3 ) of rock . It was estimated construction cost for the San Rafael Swell portion was $ 183 @.@ 5 million , $ 105 @.@ 5 million ( 1970 , $ 595 million in 2008 ) to build the first two lanes , and $ 78 million ( 1990 , $ 130 million in 2008 ) to construct the rest . At the 1970 dedication , it was noted the cost of land acquisition helped to offset the cost of the massive excavation . UDOT acquired the right of way to build the majority of I @-@ 70 from the BLM at the lowest cost per mile of any highway in Utah .

 In 2002 , the Salt Lake Tribune interviewed the mayor of Richfield about the change I @-@ 70 brought to the Sevier Valley . Previously these were isolated farming communities , whose residents felt they were unaccustomed to the crime and other effects that a transcontinental highway can bring . Residents of Richfield soon started to call I @-@ 70 " Cocaine Lane " . The mayor stated that I @-@ 70 is a mixed blessing . He stated the highway is a boon to the hospitality industry and has made Richfield more accessible to other cities . However , the new road brought types of crime previously unknown to the city . The mayor lamented that after the completion of I @-@ 70 , many residents started locking their doors for the first time . The interview resulted from an event that served as a " wake @-@ up call " , that rural Utah is " not isolated from crime " . Panic ensued after the public witnessed Utah Highway Patrol troopers carrying away a suspect in handcuffs , while removing plastic bags and coolers full of body parts from the trunk of his car . The event caused a frenzy of people checking on their neighbors , fearing the murder victims were local residents . In 2007 , there were 11 violent crimes in Sevier County , a county of 19 @,@ 386 residents . 
 Green River is the largest , and only incorporated city directly served by I @-@ 70 in eastern Utah . Unlike the communities of the Sevier Valley , Green River was founded as a stopover for travelers along transcontinental arteries . The area was first used as a stopover for travelers navigating the Green River . Later the town was formed to serve travelers along the Old Spanish Trail and stagecoach mail routes . Green River was an established stopover by the time the railroad and later highways were built through the area . 
 = = = Effect on the San Rafael Swell = = = 
 Before the construction of I @-@ 70 the San Rafael Swell was relatively inaccessible and not well known or explored . There were , however , a few efforts to protect the swell as early as 1935 . Since the construction of the freeway the number of visitors to the swell has increased significantly , as the swell can now be accessed by automobile . As such , several groups are increasing efforts for protected status of the area , via National Park , National Monument or wilderness designation . 
 A major push occurred in 2002 when officials from Emery County , joined by Utah governor Mike Leavitt , petitioned President George W. Bush to use the authority of the Antiquities Act and create a San Rafael Swell National Monument . This effort lost momentum after the governor promised to honor the wishes of Emery County residents via a non @-@ binding referendum , which did not pass . Common reasons given by residents for opposing the designation included fear of the federal government restricting access and a repetition of events that occurred with the Grand Staircase @-@ Escalante National Monument . This monument was established in 1996 , by President Bill Clinton . In that case the monument was proposed at the federal level in secret . Boundaries were drawn without the consent or even knowledge of local residents . This incited anger and triggered a backlash in rural Utah . 
 Currently most of the swell is administered by the BLM and is not given special consideration . A small portion on the eastern edge is protected as Goblin Valley State Park , administered by the Utah Division of Parks and Recreation . Today the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance continues to lobby for protection . 
 = = = Route number changes = = = 
 Before the formation of I @-@ 70 , there was a road over the Pavant Range numbered SR @-@ 13 that was similar to the route of I @-@ 70 . The highway , which largely still exists as a two @-@ lane road between SR @-@ 161 ( former US @-@ 91 ) at Cove Fort and US @-@ 89 at Sevier , had been taken over by the state on August 2 , 1912 , and assigned the label by the early 1920s as part of Utah 's initial highway numbering . In the Wasatch Plateau , the base for I @-@ 70 was derived from a portion of SR @-@ 10 . Both of these were transferred to State Route 4 , which was the state legislative designation for all of I @-@ 70 in Utah , in 1962 . U.S. Route 50 was changed to overlap with Interstate 70 through most of Utah in 1976 , with U.S. Route 6 remaining on its former route . In 1977 , Utah renumbered its state routes so that the legislative and signed numbers would match . With this change , the state designation for Interstate 70 is now State Route 70 .

It 's not just about how fabulous and glamorous and all this . It 's about the core of ' I don 't wanna be in a cage . I want to be free and do what I love ' " .

Cyrus said she had originally worn a " completely different " outfit , but wasn 't " feeling it " the morning of the shoot .

 Tokyo Tower ( <unk> , Tōkyō <unk> ) is a communications and observation tower located in the Shiba @-@ <unk> district of Minato , Tokyo , Japan . At 332 @.@ 9 metres ( 1 @,@ 092 ft ) , it is the second @-@ tallest structure in Japan . The structure is an Eiffel Tower @-@ inspired lattice tower that is painted white and international orange to comply with air safety regulations . 
 Built in 1958 , the tower 's main sources of revenue are tourism and antenna leasing . Over 150 million people have visited the tower since its opening . FootTown , a four @-@ story building located directly under the tower , houses museums , restaurants and shops . Departing from there , guests can visit two observation decks . The two @-@ story Main Observatory is located at 150 metres ( 490 ft ) , while the smaller Special Observatory reaches a height of 249 @.@ 6 metres ( 819 ft ) . 
 The tower acts as a support structure for an antenna . Originally intended for television broadcasting , radio antennas were installed in 1961 , but the tower is now used to broadcast signals for Japanese media outlets such as NHK , TBS and Fuji TV . Japan 's planned digital television transition by July 2011 was problematic , however ; Tokyo Tower 's height , 332 @.@ 9 m ( 1 @,@ 092 ft ) was not high enough to adequately support complete terrestrial digital broadcasting to the area . A taller digital broadcasting tower , known as Tokyo Skytree , was completed on February 29 , 2012 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 A large broadcasting tower was needed in the Kantō region after NHK , Japan 's public broadcasting station , began television broadcasting in 1953 . Private broadcasting companies began operating in the months following the construction of NHK 's own transmission tower . This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo , eventually overrunning the city . The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region . Furthermore , because of the country 's postwar boom in the 1950s , Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse . 
 <unk> Maeda , founder and president of Nippon Denpatō , the tower 's owner and operator , originally planned for the tower to be taller than the Empire State Building , which at 381 meters was the highest structure in the world . However , the plan fell through because of the lack of both funds and materials . The tower 's height was eventually determined by the distance the TV stations needed to transmit throughout the Kantō region , a distance of about 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) . <unk> Naitō , renowned designer of tall buildings in Japan , was chosen to design the newly proposed tower . Looking to the Western world for inspiration , Naitō based his design on the Eiffel Tower in Paris , France . With the help of engineering company <unk> Sekkei Ltd . , Naitō claimed his design could withstand earthquakes with twice the intensity of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake or typhoons with wind speeds of up to 220 kilometres per hour ( 140 mph ) . 
 The new construction project attracted hundreds of <unk> ( <unk> ) , traditional Japanese construction workers who specialized in the construction of high @-@ rise structures . The Takenaka Corporation broke ground in June 1957 and each day at least 400 laborers worked on the tower . It was constructed of steel , a third of which was scrap metal taken from US tanks damaged in the Korean War . When the 90 @-@ metre antenna was bolted into place on October 14 , 1958 , Tokyo Tower was the tallest freestanding tower in the world , taking the title from the Eiffel Tower by 13 metres . Despite being taller than the Eiffel Tower , Tokyo Tower only weighs about 4 @,@ 000 tons , 3 @,@ 300 tons less than the Eiffel Tower . While other towers have since surpassed Tokyo Tower 's height , the structure was still the tallest artificial structure in Japan until April 2010 , when the new Tokyo Skytree became the tallest building of Japan . It was opened to the public on December 23 , 1958 at a final cost of ¥ 2 @.@ 8 billion ( $ 8 @.@ 4 million in 1958 ) . Tokyo Tower was mortgaged for ¥ 10 billion in 2000 . 
 Planned as an antenna for telecommunications and brightly colored in accordance with the time 's Aviation Law , the tower 's two panoramic observatories are mostly frequented by tourists today ; the tower constitutes a clear reference point in the center 's chaotic skyline , forming a strong landmark , both night and day .

 Tokyo Tower 's two main revenue sources are antenna leasing and tourism . It functions as a radio and television broadcasting antenna support structure and is a tourist destination that houses several different attractions . Over 150 million people have visited the tower in total since its opening in late 1958 . Tower attendance had been steadily declining until it bottomed out at 2 @.@ 3 million in 2000 . Since then , attendance has been rising , and it has recently been attracting approximately 3 million visitors per year . The first area tourists must visit upon reaching the tower is FootTown , a four @-@ story building stationed directly under the tower . Here , visitors can eat , shop and visit several museums and galleries . Elevators that depart from the first floor of FootTown can be used to reach the first of two observation decks , the two @-@ story Main Observatory . For the price of another ticket , visitors can board another set of elevators from the second floor of the Main Observatory to reach the final observation deck — the Special Observatory .
